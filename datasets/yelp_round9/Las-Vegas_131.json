Nice, quick friendly service.  I think they put crack in the ceviche (actually maybe just lime and sugar) but I wanted to eat it (garnish and) all."

Mainly because i get into town late and after a full day of traveling i need somewhere \"non vegas strip\" to eat and relax.\n\nThere best roll is hands down the \"sexy roll\" but ill let you be the judge cause there all good. The waitresses are nice and the place has a nice layout. Nice top 40 hits with a huge screen where they play the music video to whatever song is playing. Kinda cool to watch if you dont wanna chill at the bar and watch whatever sports game they have on."

Then our second waiter forgot about us as well. The food was cold after 2 minutes of getting to us, and we literally almost left them a pile of barf to clean up. $0 tip for you guys!

I came in with a couple of friends and it's 12am on a Friday night, I would get if it was super packed, but it wasn't. So we had to share a menu, 3 waiters were \"waiting our table\" the reason for the quotations because they were doing anything but tending to us. Not like we asked for much. Just some more water since we had to wait so long to order, get our food just everything in general. Then we look over and see one of our \"waiters\" taking sake shots with his friends instead of taking care of other customers. Also don't asked for anything else after they bring you your food unless you wanna get hit with a nasty attitude like it's an inconvenience. Terrible service, whoever did the hiring needs to be let go cause they aren't a good judge of character."

Thankful for checking Yelp we came here instead to save a few bucks. I can't tell you how happy I am that I came here! We had the Kaizen cheviche which was heaven. Then we had the Kaizen scallop dynamite which is baked with mushrooms and cheese. I would have ordered another had we not ordered rolls. I'm a scallop fan and this was just mouth-watering good! The prices are reasonable and I'll admit I'd pay Nobu prices for this deliciousness. Don't be fooled by those high end places. Come to a local spot like this and have a great meal!"

The spicy tuna crispy rice was very good. and the firecracker roll was great as well. I wasnt a big fan of the crispy soft shell crab. I usually am, but this one had a pretty heavy batter on it much like the cheap frozen breaded shimp you can buy at the grocery store. Overall it was pretty good, and the staff was very friendly. They were out of large Sapporos, so they brought me 2 small ones...at the same time...I probably looked like a lush double fisting it in a sushi bar, but I dont mind that. :)\nThe menu had alot of very interesting and different combinations of sushi that I'll have to go back and try sometime. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a semi-modern take on sushi.\n\nPS. I went to the one off of Eastern and Horizon ridge...not the one by on Paradise."

Wait staff was great in accommodating this very rude group of friends. If your friends yell very loud inappropriate sexual things that may or may not disturb the other diners, this place will still not kick you out! Believe me, they are great! \n\nDo not under any circumstances order the baked scallops or some roll with jalape\u00f1os on top of it! Both my friends said those two items were gross. However, the roll I ordered that has ponzu sauce on it was delicious and I heard the Poke is phenomenal so could be hit or miss. The menu has excellent pictures so you can use your best judgement to make the right decision. Although, making right decisions and being in Las Vegas usually don't go together."

I guess it's because it implies that the dishes are not at their best if you are constantly trying to improve. \n\nAnyhow, this place is somewhat of a novelty for the Japanese because they usually do not see nor tasted American-style sushi rolls. We ordered the tuna poke, 16pcs sushi combo, 20pcs sashimi, calamari tempura roll and a spicy rainbow roll.\n\nNothing is really out of the ordinary. The poke tasted a bit odd but the sashimi and spicy rainbow roll were decent. A bit on the pricey side.\n\nThere's an overhead projection of random music and videos playing. A large bar on the side. The location was easy to find with plenty of parking."

I love authentic food, but this place is just ok.  I hate to give a less than spectacular rating, but I've never had a great meal from here.  If you come here for late night sushi, hit up musashi!

Even the sauces could be measured by a squirt. I don't know if this is the norm or if they figured that we wouldn't recognize the bite sizes until we reached home. The only good thing was that it was open at 12:30 in the morning."

Given that many of the Vegas sushi spots are AYCE, I expected the non-AYCE sushi restaurants to have higher quality fish. \nThey have an extensive menu of Japanese fusion dishes. Seems like the popular thing to get here are their specialty rolls. My rolls were poorly put together, but I was okay with it, given that it was late at night and I was craving sushi."

Just arrived from LA to visit my grandparents for the holiday, got out of the care home way later than expected, hotel check-in was a mess, all the boyfriend and I felt like was sushi. It was 10:30 and everything was about to close at 11. We gave up on the \"epic Vegas dining experience\" and just picked the highest rated sushi joint on yelp that was open. Some place in a strip mall. (Eyebrow raised)\n\nJust upon walking in, we were shocked to see and feel such a nice and trendy vibe. Clean, classy, good music, nice bar, neat tables. We sat at the bar and opened the fabulously photographed menus. Sushi spots with photos is a major plus for me and they had EVERYTHING photographed. We picked a bunch of stuff and were blown away with not only the taste/freshness/quality of fish, but the presentation, price/portions, service... Just everything. The bill ended up being $122 and trust me... we were really going for it. Anywhere else back in LA would have racked up to $200+. \n\nWe stayed and hung out well after we were stuffed to the brim. The ambiance is nice and I felt like I was getting a special type of Vegas experience without all the hustle and bustle. I will absolutely be showing this place off to friends who join me on future trips. What a treat!\n\nOh yeah... And it's open until 6am. AND they have a happy hour that starts at midnight. GENIUS!!!\n\nI posted photos of what we ate - albacore topped with fried onions, filet mignon salad, white rose roll, sea bass & unagi. We also had saki bombs, the largest portion of edemami ever, uni and crispy tuna tostada things. YUM YUMMMMM YUM"

Perhaps it was a big mistake to come to sushi hungry after indulging in quite a few drinks. Let's just say it would have been beneficial for us and our pocket books to do AYCE elsewhere. Between 3 of us, we graciously cashed out at $100 on sushi on individual rolls not AYCE. Well it wouldn't have been that bad, however, when most AYCE places are around $24 a person, it would have been cheaper to go elsewhere! The rolls were enjoyable but not mouthgasmic and overpriced. I do give them credit for surprising the birthday girl with a tempura green tea dessert, which we enjoyed greatly. I'll stick to my sushi joints off the strip."

So this review will average itself out at 3 stars. \n\nHere's the situation. My friend and I went driving around looking for a place to eat at around 4a and yelped the nearest location. Boom Kaizen popped up near UNLV. \n\nThe food, for the price is awesome, I got a baked salmon roll. Delicious. Unlike all the other all you can eat places here and original. He got some type of calamari roll and something else. \n\nAdding an $11 lychee flavored sake and a green tea tempura ice cream (but they don't serve vanilla flavor which didn't really make any sense to me but who am I...) who couldn't be more pleased?\n\nWell... let's start from the beginning. \n\nThe serve here was beyond poor. Upon entrance the two girls that we were working had just the most unengaging attitudes and missed so many marks. I had to ask 3 times for the same 7UP, the miscommunication was so obviously there that the poor service just had to be mentioned.\n\nI mean and I'm not to be a stickler about table courtesies, but all the servers that took our dishes away or served us just stuck their whole bodies right between both my friend and I - based on my memory as a server, aren't you supposed to come around the side or wouldn't that just make more sense? Anyway - it was an odd experience. Given I understand it's 5:30 in the morning at that point everyone wants to go home and they're shoving people out, but the place is still an establishment and the restaurant clearly strategically placed itself across certain hotel&casinos for a reason, but the place was dead on a Saturday night for obvious reasons...\n\nI mean it's obviously not the food, the food is great and decently priced.\n\nWorth it if it's LAST LAST minute late night dinner and you're near the UNLV campus."

            "review": "Yelp, you're fired. Four stars?! All I wanted was non-AYCE sushi, rated decently,  and near the strip. Jesus H. Christ! It's a fail when you come into a restaurant starving and you leave with everyone in your party invoking the Lord's name with his middle initial.*\n\nThings started out okay with them seating us promptly. We drooled over the menu and ordered enough to feed every child in Botswana. It went downhill from there. The first piece of sushi, two pieces of uni, took almost an hour to get to our table. WE WERE WASTING VALUABLE GAMBLING TIME! Everyone at the craps table is depending on me to get back in the game.\n\nThe sushi man was a little stingy. It wasn't like I was ordering a 49 cent taco from Del Taco in South LA and then complaining to the cashier, and then to the manager that there wasn't enough meat in my sub-dollar taco, all the while getting approving \"um-huh\"s from my significant other standing behind me. You know? They could've been slightly more generous. \n\nWhat's funny is I think they were Thai. Thai reminds me of Thailand. Thailand reminds me of my vacation to Phuket. In Phuket, we journeyed to a steakhouse that was highly, I mean HIGHLY, rated by Tripadvisor. So I thinks, maybe we's getting a good deal on expensive steak. My partner orders a ribeye, bone-in, because that's how us gangsters roll. The waitress retorts, \"Just to let you know, it's a little chewy.\" My partner responds, \"What do you mean?\" Waitress says, \"Are you Malay?\" My partner, looking confused, says, \"No.\" Waitress replies, \"Have you had a steak before?\" HAHAHA. Okay, screw you guys. It was funny at the time.\n\nANYWAYZ. You're better off going to some of the better AYCE in Vegas and not stuffing your face. You'll pay the same amount, or less, and get better quality sushi.\n\n*In almost a decade spent in church, they never taught me what what Jesus's middle initial stood for, although the whispers say it may be Herbert, but it wasn't from me."

We waited about 10 minutes before any employee came by.  We were ready for drinks and to order when a server came to a table next to us (only because a diner at the table hollered for her to stop by).  She almost walked away when one of our diners asked her to come to our table because we were ready to order.  She told us she wasn't our server and would have him come to our table.\nA couple minutes later, he arrived.  He suffered through taking our order.  He was writing it down, but we still had to repeat ourselves a couple times.  I had our drink order memorized at that point and slowly said it to him again.  Then we ordered about 7 different items.  We were really worried about getting the right items.  \nThe food began to come to us, before we got our cocktails.  I chose to wait a couple minutes for my drink before I started eating.  We ordered quite a few items, but I only tried a couple.  The cucumber salad was fresh, crisp and delicious.  I thought the beef sashimi was delicious, but my friend thought it was bland.  I had the chicken teriyaki roll and substituted with soy paper.  I highly recommend it.  Inside the roll is piece of chicken teriyaki, crab, avocado, and cucumber and they are placed on teriyaki sauce.  It was delicious!  The best part was the serving of chicken teriyaki with broccoli, mushrooms, and onions next to the rolls.  \n4 cocktails and 7 dishes came out to about 90 dollars; not bad.  The funny thing was, when we wanted our bill, the gal who said she wasn't our server was able to bring us our check when we asked her to have our server do so.  Next time we're in Vegas and want sushi, we'll probably go here, but sit at the bar for more prompt service.\nOn a funny side note... one of the nearby diners was Carrot Top."

The restaurant itself is beautiful and servers are very polite.\nThey're always checking on you.\nThey have a nice menu, nice sake selection. They're not expensive or crowded. It could be a very good restaurant.\n\nHere's why I'm giving this place one star, hygiene. \nAs soon as we sat down I noticed a piece of hair on the small soy sauce dish, not cool! But I decided to ignore it since my husband gave me his, as I was the only one who was going to eat.\nA few minutes after we started eating I asked for paper napkins and as the server was bringing them to me one fell down on the floor. Surprisingly she picked it up and put it together with the other napkin she was bringing me... After giving me the clean and dirty napkin she took the dirty one with her saying it was dirty, and I honestly believe that if she knew we hadn't seen it she would have given me the dirty and the clean one. \nThat was the end for me, I could barely finish my meal as I was disgusted.\n\nIt's a nice restaurant with good food but they could use hygiene."

I had two full sized cut rolls for about 25. Not only was the price right, the chow was DAMN tasty. One roll had a house sauce made of a spicy mayo mix. YUM!!!\nThe one down fall was the sake. I didn't notice a house sake and the cheapest bottle was $10. Now please keep in mind I'm only criticizing this because I'm on the work budget. $10 for a bottle of good sake is very reasonable.

We did this because the line for Yama Sushi (which is my fave sushi spot in town) had a line waaaay out the door and to be honest I just did not want to wait that long. So. Enter Kaizen, which had good Yelp reviews, but alas, was somewhat of a disappointment. \n\nFirst with the good, the place LOOKS fabulous. Dark exterior, plays with lovely lighting and the tables are large with good spacing. Dinnerware and presentation is superb, but it better be since this place is so close to the Strip. Customer service is so-so. Although the entire staff yells as people enters/leaves, our service with food to our table was only okay. I ordered a hot green tea and it was brought out in a large cup, which I dislike because I enjoy my tea HOT. As it sits uncovered it cools down quickly and not once did a server ask to refill it. I prefer smaller cups and pots of tea for this reason.\n\nOrdered:\n\n- Edamame \n- California Roll\n- Tuna Roll \n- Shrimp Roll\n- Spicy Rainbow Roll\n- Spicy Tuna Hand Roll\n\nPluses - size of rolls at least (kind of) make you not feel so bad about how much you are paying and that you cannot get AYCE here. PLUS, again, presentation is great and sushi is very good quality. The only qualm I had was with the Tuna Roll being a bit on the warmer side when it arrived at our table than I would have liked.\n\nMy husband is a super picky sushi eater (hence the very plain rolls we had). The place does have some interesting rolls, the spicy rainbow roll was decent, and large, I'm glad I ordered it as it did fill me up.\n\nBEST - Edamame, just stinking amazing for some reason. Served steaming, with a good amount of salt, and a LARGE portion.\n\nNot the best... again, price wise you can find just as good sushi elsewhere and Vegas, except you don't have to pay for the atmosphere and Jay-Z music videos in the background.... HOLY GRAIL!!!"

The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  The nigiri was average, but the rolls we had were nothing special.  It might have just been the night we went, but something did not seem right with the items that came from the fryer (like the tempura).  One plus is that the price was fair and the place was open late.  The service was friendly, but a bit slow.  Overall, I will not likely go back.  With so many options, this restaurant failed to make an impression and for the price point, I prefer Hamada down the road."

My friend ordered a roll (maybe hardrock roll?) that had lots of fish and no rice which was also tasty.  My complaint is that the prices are too high for a casual sushi spot.  I would come here a lot more if they were more reasonable or if they had a better happy hour.  There are so many great sushi spots in town with better deals unless it's really late i'll probably go elsewhere.  The happy hour starts around midnight and is only 1/2 off on booze and not much discount on any food other than certain hand rolls."

Oh man. I have a new favorite, fo' sho'. A little slower than some places (as others have pointed out) but worth it, I think. They take their time to make sure it's executed perfectly. Service with a smile and we lacked for nothing. \n\nThe shitake mushroom roll was earthy and perfectly balanced with the crunch of veg and a touch of crispy tempura. Served with some tempura fungi on the side, and it's a complete dish! \n\nThe Rose and White Rose rolls have been entered into my foodporn um, brain bank... ;) No rice (perfect for me): it's amazing fish, sauce, and a touch of veg here and there... WRAPPED IN MORE FISH. #winwin\n\nWe also had a soft-shell crab roll (the name escapes me and it's not on the online menu) that was similar. More fish wrapped in fish. Really. #happyMuse\n\nWe had a few other rolls, including the Rock and Roll, the Firecracker, a crunchy scallop roll (served with additional panko-breaded scallops! Yum!), and an unagi/avocado roll. All very, very good. The sauces were not overly used - Bonus points! - just enough to go with the flavor profiles they were trying to create. No sauce-drowned fishies here!\n\nTo taste the fish on its own (as Bentern says in his review, without the \"tacky\" sauce), we did order some nigiri including salmon, tuna, and uni. The uni, my favorite but not that of my dining companions, was fresh, sweet, and perfect. Always a great sign of a great place, IMHO.\n\nAgain I have to point out that I like that they don't pack their rolls with rice (and have a LOT of non-rice options). The menu is *extensive* (the online menu is a fraction of the options you actually have). In addition to the sushi and sashimi, they offer some entrees as well.\n\nI don't mind a lack of AYCE because I don't eat enough to make those \"deals\" worth it. However, I could see the draw in having something here... They can be on the pricey side. That said, Friday night we had a hell of a meal between the three of us... a ton of great food, a couple cucumber salads (meh... just a lot of cucumber in a martini glass... wasn't impressed), some soup, and all those rolls. For... 70ish bucks? Three people? Not bad at all for what you are getting.\n\nAnd now I am hungry... Dinner, anyone?"

They have a TV.\nIt's a nice and quiet place, but there weren't many people there, so it might be different when it's packed.\n\nAbout me:\nI'm Japanese. I love sushi. I go out to eat sushi once a month or so by myself. I was in Vegas just for the weekend.\n\nSummary:\nI went at around 8:30 pm, and they were out of uni & toro. I ordered mainly nigiri sushi and not much stood out. I also got the chicken katsu, which wasn't bad but nothing special.\nFood: 3/5 - Average\nService: 4/5 - Good\nOverall: 3/5\n\nReview:\nI went at around 8:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend. I made a reservation twenty minutes beforehand, but the place was almost empty when we arrived. The first things I always order at a sushi bar are toro and uni. They were both out, but it was 8:30pm, so it was understandable.\n\nI started out with albacore belly, mackerel, salmon, ikura, and tuna. I usually always order albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon as they're a few of my favorite sushi. The ones I had here weren't bad, but they didn't taste great either. I was here with a friend who doesn't eat sushi as often, so I ordered the tuna (something common) and ikura (slightly obscure) for him as well. The tuna and ikura tasted better than I expected, but my expectations were set a little low after eating their albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon. I may have ordered something else as well here, but I'm drawing a blank.\n\nI didn't want the bill to get too large, so I ordered chicken katsu to share with my friend. The chicken katsu was a little thin, and they were cut into pieces the size of a pencil (in terms of thickness/width). This is personal preference, but I preferred the pieces to be a little fatter/wider.\n\nI wanted to finish off the night with some more sushi, so I asked the sushi chef for a recommendation and ordered the madai. It was actually pretty good. Possibly the best sushi of the night. I ended up ordering another serving.\n\nThe bill came out to be ~$100 for the two of us, which is average for a sushi place (not too cheap, not too expensive). I paid $60 ($10 tip) for the meal.\n\nDuring the meal, the waitress made sure I didn't run out of my tea (she asked if I would like more when I was low), so that was nice. She also asked us multiple times how our meal was going. So the service here was pretty good.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a decent sushi place, but it wasn't good enough to make it a go-to sushi bar every time I'm in Vegas. I think it's worth exploring other options.\n\nFood: 3/5 - Average\nAtmosphere: 4/5 - Good\nService: 4/5 - Good\nOverall: 3/5 (weighed on food score)\n\nOther thoughts:\nI went to a sushi place in San Diego called Sushi Ota about a month prior to visiting Kaizen Sushi in Vegas. The sushi at Sushi Ota tasted incredible, so it raised the bar for my future sushi outings. I may have rated Kaizen Sushi higher if I hadn't visited Sushi Ota."

Our favorite was yellowtail with a wasabi sauce. \n\nTempura green tea ice cream was perfect, firm ice cream with just the right thickness of batter. \n\nService was quick, friendly and polite.

They have quite the selection of rolls. However the rolls are a bit smaller than other sushi places I've been to. The food is good though & comes out rather quickly regardless of what the wait staff tells you. The wait staff is a bit slow at times even when it's not peak hours. Try a saketini if you get a chance they taste a bit like sangria. If you're like me & order a Sapporo you expect it to come w/ a beer glass chilled not a Modelo Especial glass. Deduction of points on that fro me. The atmosphere is well lit. You can sit at a booth area or at a table. The tables are picnic style so you could be rubbing elbows w/ neighbors during busier hours. \nIf you're a local this place a bit pricier than other sushi restuarants for less of the food. Again great food, just need to eat more to be full. Normally 2 rolls & an app w/ a beer will fill me up. It took 3 rolls & an app w/ a beer to fill me up here. \nTried 9 rolls last night out of our group:\nShrimp Killer - Good\nSpicy Rainbow Roll - VERY GOOD\nTeriyaki Roll - Not so good\nSilver State Roll - SO GOOD\nDragon Roll - ok\nAvacado Roll - ok\nTiger Roll - Good\nFirecracker - SO GOOD"

Not a super busy place during the evening/dinner time which is nice because we needed someplace low-key to eat. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I am picky with seafood and sushi and I was impressed with the sushi here. The tuna was very fresh and the roll was made well. My friend got salmon and it was delicious and fresh. The price is not crazy which is also what attracted us here. Overall great place to have a low-key dinner."

I had to tell them to take it back. And all the items on the menu was mainly tuna. Halfway eating I was starting to get sick of the smell and taste of tuna. This experience wasn't what I hoped for.

Delicious spicy hamachi, tuna sashimi in garlic ponzu, rainbow roll, unagi, various maki of salmon persuasions, I could go on... The vegetarian among us was also pleased with her rolls. I was quite impressed with the freshness of the fish (a feat of modernity I've never gotten over since inhabiting landlocked states).  \n\nEven after several add-ons to our orders, sake for the table, and mango mochi, the total bill was still impressively moderate.

Instead of traditional tempura batter, they used the same batter as that of the chicken katsu which was a big let down for me as it was not as I had expected. My girlfriend had the pork katsu which bowl which was excellent as I picked off her plate as well as mine. If your in the area, give this place a try. I do hope though the tempura shrimp thing was a fluke and it was because they ran out of the proper batter. Otherwise, it would be a big strike against them as far as I am concerned."

It would have made it much more entertaining if I did.\n\nIn any case, Kaizen Sushi is not a bad place to get your sushi fixing in Vegas.  They specialize in fusion rolls, so right off the bat, you know that you should focus more so on them instead of simply nigiri or sashimi.  The atmosphere inside reminded me of a very fancy bar, both very dark and roomy.  They have a pretty sweet deal for those night owls (or those trying to be) where much of their food becomes half off.  Considering that this place is open late, this place is definitely for those post-clubbing events.\n\nFor my mini lunch, I ordered the Calamari Tempura Roll, which came out to be about $8.  I love eating fried squid, and was interested in seeing their take on combining it into a sick sushi roll.  What I really loved about this roll was that even though it came in only five pieces, they gave me the extra calamari on the side.  It also came with a sweet dipping sauce.\n\nMy roll was okay.  Nothing to rave about to be honest, but it was a good way for me to get my sushi fixing for the day.  Everything else on the menu seems to be way overpriced, especially in Vegas when there are so many other eating bargains out there.\n\nDefinitely worth a try, but go ahead and gamble at Hard Rock and make some moolah first before you come here.  Then you can fest like a KING/QUEEN!\n\nParking is available outside in the plaza."

For starters I think it's in bad taste when they add mandatory gratuity for service. I feel a tip should be based on the service provided, which was decent but not out of this world. The iced green tea tasted like fish water. Waitress tried to tell me they add some special leaves or whatever but fish is fish is fish and that tea tasted like fish!!! The short ribs were greasy and burnt. The other rolls were decent but nothing I would come back for. Matter of fact we were left so unsatisfied we're on our way to get tacos now after leaving this place!"

We walked over (not a great idea, but we were hungry and didn't want to wait in the cab line) from Hard Rock after partying it up at Center Bar (awesome time too) and ate there at 4:30 in the morning.  I especially liked the cheers we got when we walked in, looking awesome I'm sure, after a night of excessive drinking and partying.  The place is a like a club that serves sushi.  There is a deejay spinning tunes and with the exception of the sushi bar, most of the restaurant is dark.  The food though, was absolutely fantastic."

I think if you go upscale make the chopsticks upscale too and stop cutting down trees. The menu is huge!!!! \n\nOk so the BBQ roll isn't good to me. The meat was chewy. Too chewy I swallowed many bites whole because I couldn't break it down. Crunchy roll was good. Tried the crazy boy it was interesting. Not bad but I just didn't like it. I had ordered the Katsura roll to try it but it never came. They charged me for it and then I told them I never got it. They took it off. \n\nOk so here is where I get picky. One if I order something bring it to me. Two 3 different people came up to our table asking if we are done eating and paid yet. Seriously I ordered rolls a few times relax and let me eat or wait for the goof.  When I'm done eating I'll let you know. And three when we walk in and I tell you we want a table instead of sushi bar don't suggest the sushi bar over and over."

The counter height is at least a half-a-foot too high - check it out.\n\nTheir spicy crab hand roll ($5.50) looked something out of a scary anime movie. It was a crumpled up sheet of imitation crab soaked in a warm red mystery sauce sloppily stuffed into a sheet of nori. By the time it was handed to me it was soggy and clearly unappetizing. I've *never* seen a spicy crab hand roll look like this. I would even go as far as saying it was really gross. I dare say it tasted even worse than it looked - warm, chewy, and messy. Somewhere in Japan, this has got to be considered illegal sushi.\n\nOur sushi chef's demeanor was deadpan and straight up unfriendly. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but we soon caught his drift and decided to leave after another order (a scallop sushi roll which was ugly as shit, and made without care).\n\nJust when I thought we cut our losses and were off to another establishment to save our supper, I was given the \"Sorry, sir, our system is down, can you pay with cash?\" What complete crap. I should've called their bluff. It's been 5 years since I've encountered that in Vegas. Visa, Mastercard Inc., and the Better Business Bureau should be notified.\n\nThe industry folks love this place, and I don't understand it. Avoid at all costs."

I said. SUSHI.\n\nAnd luckily, without any attempt of harm, or kidnap or rape...we made it safely to the sushi spot...in a LIMO.\n\nfly!\n\nTip: Girls. we just got lucky our limo driver isn't a douchebag. But do not attept to hop in, to any limo just because it's a dashing limo..I didn't think at that point. Thank god we didn't get killed in our short skirts.\n\nAnyway....\n\nSo...my girlfriend and I ...along with our drunken hungry stomachs..ordered so much sushi, which we devoured in less than an hour....\n\nService on a saturday night was great. No long wait. and they are really friendly.\n\nI had to take my boyfriend here....so we came back here on Monday...again....\n\nWhat i've tried here so far..i really did like...\n\nhere we go: (this is from two nights of being here)\n\n*First Kiss: Deep Fried Shrimp topped with soft shell crab, tuna and white fish. \nIt comes with a subtle tangy sauce with a flavor that's just about right without overpowering the natural flavor and tast of the fish.\n\n*The \"O\" Roll: Chopped deep fried soft shell crab, spicy tuna and avocado, topped with Yellowtail. \nAs the name says.... This is a full blown Orgasm in your mouth. Definitely a must try. It gave me multiples. I had to order this twice.\n\n*Palm Springs Roll: OMG. This is an orgasm within an Orgasm.\nCubed Tuna in Spicy Mayo and Ponzy Sauce galore, with crab, avocado and cucumber. Soooo Goooooood. This is really amazing.\nWe ordered this on our two nights we were at Kaizen.\n\n*Kiss of Fire: If you like Spicy...you'll love this roll. Inside: there's crab, avocado and cucumber... Topped with Spicy Tuna, White Fish, Jalapeno. Sauce: spicy garlic ponzu and hot sauce..... Down this with Asahi or a shot of Sake. you're good.\n\n*Kaizen Roll: Who doesn't agree that anything deep fried is just oh. so . good??? and unhealthy? whatever sushi pooper. This roll is a must try as well. IN: Deep fried soft shell crab, lobster, avocado, asparagus, yamagobo,cucumber, radish sprouts.. Topped with Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. sauce: eel sauce.\n\n*Chicken Teriyaki Bowl: Even their Chicken Teriyako Bowl is not ordinary. It's yuuuummmmy!!!!\n\nWhat i like about this Sushi Joint is that...it's not over-rated and doesnt try to be fancy shmancy like other sushi joints on the strip. They keep their quality and deliver freshness fish after fish..after fish. Service is fast and excellent. Prices are decent. Fish cuts are thick and generous. Selection is different and unique.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place to Sushi Lovers in Vegas!"

I got tired of burgers and pizzas, and I wanted something different. This place had teriyaki bowls at $8.95 a bowl. It wasn't a restaurant quality teriyaki bowl as I expected. Infact I have had way better ones in Socal at mom and pop places. However I m must say I do like the ambiance of this place. They got a sports bar style counter setup with some flat  screens. And behind the bar were the chefs making sushi on the fly. If I was into Sushi, I would definitely come here.

Beautifully designed and there is different types of seating, so if you're in the mood for high chairs at the bar or high end picnic style tables for a large group or a more intimate setting with regular tables and comfy chairs, you can take your pick! This is Super important for me as I don't do bar chairs and usually the non bar chairs at sushi places are terrible, packed in tight and just uncomfortable especially if you happen to be the owner of a larger behind! \n\nNext is the service, they are Super friendly and welcoming every time we came and after our 3rd visit our waitress even welcomed me back like an old friend and gave me a hug! They make you feel comfortable and that is awesome. Everyone is on point with their service providing refills and just checking if everything is ok. Speaking of which one time I had ordered something that I didn't particularly like and they took it right back no questions asked. \n\nOf course the most important part, the food is super fresh and really well put together! Having gone about 7 times recently, we always had at least above average to perfection each time. Their chefs clearly know what they're doing and you can taste it. \n\nFavorites: \nScreaming o salad \nCharlie's angels \nUnicorn roll \nSuper spider roll\nPalm Springs roll\nMiso soup \nFuji Apple sake \nKorean bbq beef \n\nWe have visited probably 30+ sushi restaurants in Vegas and California and I would easily rate this in my top 3 for overall experience. It is probably a good thing I live in Arizona or I would go broke coming here all the time! \n\nAlso they are open super late and we have been there both for lunch and at 3 am and received the same service and quality each time."

In the fall of 2014 I had been in Las Vegas briefly and had quickly grabbed takeout from here. I remember thinking the ambience was fun. Returning to Las Vegas in December of 2015 I used Yelp to track down this sushi restaurant that I remembered enjoying but couldn't remember the name of.\n\nSince I was traveling for work I was often on my own for dinner. Walking into Kaizen I was instantly welcomed and the staff was more than happy to give me a table to myself since the restaurant was not too busy. \n\nOver the three separate visits I made to Kaizen I got to sample a variety of rolls, all of which I enjoyed:\n-Philadelphia Roll-specially requested for this to be made with salmon and cream cheese inside and salmon on top\n-Sexy Roll-spicy tuna inside topped with fresh tuna, smelt eggs, and tangy sauce\n-Crunch Roll-deep fried shrimp, Yamagobo, cucumber inside topped with tempura crunch and eel sauce\n-Red Rock Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna, seared tuna, and spicy mayo\n-Hot Night Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce\n-Orange Blossom Roll-deep fried chopped shrimp and crab inside topped with salmon and tangy sauce\n\nEverything I had was delicious and the service is polite and quick. Definitely great to stop in for dinner when traveling for business. On weekends the restaurant can get significantly busier so expect to sit at the bar if you're dining solo."

First, it's korean owned (like most sushi places..\nIn case you didn't know, sushi rolls were invented in korea, not japan), they serve Japanese food, but not traditional Japanese cuisine, if that's what you're looking for (try Ichiza). I came here for sushi, and to my dissapointment, the sushi was not fresh, I've been here twice and both times the fish was old.. From tuna to uni, the sushi was old and dry. Not to mention the size of their cuts.. For the price they charge they should at least make up for quantity. I've had an order of $6 nigiri that filled me up more than their $22 chirashi bowl (mix sushi bowl). Ok maybe not... but you get the idea.. The only reason why they dont deserve a 1 star review is the fact that they have friendly people working there, and they are open later than most sushi places in vegas (they close at 4am).. so prepare to order a couple of Sapporo's and Sake, and hope it makes the food taste better."

I love myself a teriyaki chicken but not with gross dark meat.  I understood back in the day the cheap way to go for these places is the dark meat, but now in a health cautious world a place such as this should have white meat for Gods sake. \n\nAnyways, food pretty good.  Service good...they guy actually remembered I needed a fork for my salad. hehe  The place is always empty for the most part.

It's close to my work and open late, which is great considering I get off work around late some days- but if I can't afford to eat there then it's not a viable option. \n\nThe interior is nice, with long wooden tables and an open feel despite the small size. The music doesn't really jibe with the asian food theme, and there are large TV screens along some of the walls playing random video.\n\nOverall the food is tasty but expensive. For the same price range I could have multiple courses at Ichiza. The salmon killer roll IS especially good, so I would go back for that sometime, but expect the bill to run a bit high. It can also be awkward navigating out of the parking lot given the location and all the one-way streets."

They took forever to clear my area of plates and took forever to give me the check and come to pick it up! I am very unhappy with the Customer service here. \n\nBut the pineapple saketini were great"

But it was about as good as the sushi you might get pre-made from a grocery store.  \"Mediocre\" is the best I could possibly rate it.   \n\nThe decor in the restaurant was beautiful; a lot nicer than I would have expected for a strip mall restaurant.  And the service was fine.  But the menus were that cheap laminated stuff you find in low-end Chinese restaurants, with poorly lit photos of the rolls.  And the descriptions were all so formulaic:  Inside - tuna avocado, on top - shrimp, sauce - ponzu.   They all read like that so that none of them stood out to you.  They all sounded pretty much the same.\n\nBut most importantly, of the 4 rolls we ordered, none were outstanding.  They were all just blah with a slightly fishy taste to the sushi.\n\nI would NOT go here again and I would certainly not recommend it to anyone. We should have spent the extra $$ and gone across the street to Nobu (in the Hard Rock) for some seriously amazing sushi."

The seating arrangements have options. You can sit at the bar, separate tables, or picnic style table. We had the tuna hand roll, ceviche, and octopus and cucumber salad. The best hands down was the octopus and cucumber salad. It had the perfect blend of sweet, cool, sea, and spicy. The tuna hand rolls were simple but great. No frills, just tuna and rice; the way it should be. The ceviche was delicious but I wasn't too big a fan of the rice noodles inside. But, it was definitely 5 star ready.

Kaizen means \"continuous improvement\" - why would any restaurant want to name themselves this?  Maybe Kaizen Sushi is aware of its shortcomings and wants to strive to be the best.  HMMM...\n\nFood & Drinks\nI came here with a couple of girlfriends for lunch and we immediately ordered lychee sake.  Points for having this on the menu!  It might be the Boone's Farm of sake, but can't deny that it was goooood!  We didn't want anything too heavy to eat because we had early dinner reservations, so one of my girlfriends had sashimi, the other had a bento box of short ribs, while I had the ahi salad.  As you can see, the unifying thread was NO RICE  (we were going clubbing that night - we didn't want to look TOO bloated!)  Amazingly, these dishes were satisfying - the portions were pretty generous.  Because we ordered from the lunch menu, everything was reasonably priced.   No complaints here!\n\nAtmosphere\nKaizen is located in a little strip mall, so we weren't expecting the place to look anything less than your run-of-the mill sushi joint.  However, Kaizen had some pizzazz - the walls were colorful and rock music was playing.  We felt like we had walked into a bar.  For what it is, Kaizen scores points for atmosphere too - no complaints here either!\n\nService\nThis is where Kaizen should practice some Kaizen.  Orders came to the table slowly and randomly.  The bento box came first, which had my friend & I drooling.  My order came last, and by this time I was ravenous!  They should have served our food all at once! \n\nSo I'd give Kaizen 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll round up because their name suggests they are striving for perfection.  As far as the service goes, I should hope so!"

The waitress was pleasant and helpful, but was the only one working the entire lunch rush and couldn't handle everything. I sat at the bar and waited a good deal of time between each roll, and had empty water glasses the entire time.\n\nI think the service is probably perfectly fine when there are more employees there, and the rolls were certainly tasty. Slightly overpriced in my opinion, but tasty. I'd say this place is worth a try if you're headed to the airport and want somewhere that isn't flooded with tourists."

And it's the only place any of the bartenders, waitstaff, hosts, taxi drivers, and security guards at Wynn, TI, The Venetian, or Fashion Show mall knew about....  so I'll go ahead and declare this the latest-open sushi place I've ever been to on this continent.  (If you know of anything open later in Norcal, DC, or LV, message me.)\n\nThe taxi ride here from the strip was all of like $7.  Of course we spent more than that, because we first tried Tao for sushi, but it was closed.  Then Social House - closed.  Then Ra: cerrado.  Then Hamada: shut, barely.  Then here, after burning a few hundred walking calories and a yuppie food stamp on the taxi.  Once we got here, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  And the place was actually about a quarter full - with the younger party-looking set.  No one raving drunk though.  The nigiri was a bit more expensive than that would've-been-$7 taxi ride per pair but not exorbitant for Vegas.  Not the cheapest or best I've had, but the salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna nigiri were all fresh enough and they did have some delicious, albeit very thinly sliced toro ($19/pair), again at 3am.  I mean if someone can satisfy my sushi craving at 3am on a Monday night making the fish taste good is gravy.  They also had some white tuna that is the \"pure white\" type we geigens love and large bottles of Kirin.  And we couldn't help but notice a group of 4 at the bar doing sake bombs dominoes style (which the undergrad in me says looked pretty cool I must admit).  \n\nI doubt 3am sake bombs are even legal in Cali.  Along with most other things in this town.  Viva Las Vegas."

I got the spicy tuna salad for which have tuna poke and seaweed salad along with an actual salad below and there amazing dressing. Worth it. Then I tried special roll which was great and it had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and yellowtail on top. Then I ordered just a basic spicy tuna roll and added cream cheese as  you can do that here. To top it off I have the mochi ice cream which is great! The only reason why this restaurant did not get 5 star is because the service was piss poor. Get more servers as a Sunday night, off the strip with great priced sushi is gonna be busy. Go here if you want some good sushi! :)"

They had stated that this pale was open until 6 A.M. which was a major plus since It was past midnight at that point. Ended up getting to the restaurant around 1. We started off with a bottle of sake called \"nothingness\" which was pretty good. (Sweeter cold sake) The food was absolutely amazing, everything was fresh and delicious. The service was also very good! Since it was considered happy hour at that time they brought us an extra bottle of sake on the house. It was only a 5 minute cap ride from Planet Hollywood here which wasn't bad at all. I initially had doubts about this place number one because it was off the strip and number 2 because it was open so late, but I am glad I ended up coming here as oppose to anywhere else. The vibe was also very good. A nice place to take a date. For it being a sushi restaurant in Vegas the price was very reasonable, I was expecting it to be about doubled what I ended up paying! I will definitely come back here next time I am in town! I can easily say it is one of the top 5 sushi spots I have been too!"

The sushi felt like it wasn't very fresh and it was completely warm by the time I got it home (to be fair, it was 100 degrees outside but the car ride was only 5 minutes and the AC was on... so I don't think that could have been the culprit!).

The staff is really polite and always on top of their game, even when it's super busy and they are clearly understaffed.  The waiters and waitresses they have know the entire menu and restaurant very well + their regulars.  The best thing about this restaurant is the layout and seating options.  When I dine with friends where we will be talking a ton and want a more private area, the tables on the left offer a nice view of the restaurant without all of the noise and busyness.  When I come alone I either prefer the bar top or the long tables on the main floor area, depending on the mood I am in.  \n\nI love the music here and although it can seem a little bit loud sometimes when the restaurant is full and Lady Gaga is playing over the sound system to add to the noise, it somehow seems fitting to the energy of the servers here.  \n\nI really do wish Kaizen would start doing an AYCE menu at least during certain hours.  Their sushi is really fresh and if they offered AYCE, I would likely get more nigiri than rolls as their nigiri and hand rolls seem quite pricey for being so small."

I am so used to friendly, outgoing sushi chefs, so while he was by no means rude, his customer facing skills leave something to be desired.\n\nSushi: And of course the most important aspect of. Sushi restaurant. Unfortunately, this is a C to C+. As a frequent sushi nosher and lover or nigiri, I was more than a little disappointed. What I ordered: salmon, yellowtail belly, uni, and unagi. The unagi was the best of the 4. But honestly, it's pretty touch to mess up since its BBQ'd. Flavor was good, although the unagi sauce was cloyingly sweet. The salmon was second best. Standard. Not bad, but not great. Slightly flavorless. The yellowtail belly and uni were terrible. I was really looking forward to the buttery fattiness, but found it entirely flavorless and stale (the ends were hard which I've never experience with sushi). To be honest , I choked down the uni. Sad because it's one of my favorites to order. It had an odd metallic flavor that again, I've never experienced. Additionally, the nigiri itself was really sloppy. Most all fell apart as soon as I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks.\n\nWish I could have given it at least 3 stars, but the food quality is obviously a big factor. I've been here a few times, so this isn't based on a one time experience."

Then i saw the nicely formed, eye appealing varieties of sushi on the white plates.  As i looked through the menu, it was so hard to choose which roll to get. I wanted to try them all but my bank account wouldn't let me. The waiter was patient and made some recommendations. As soon as it came to the table we devoured them up, thus no picture was taken.  The rice on each roll was fluffy and not overly sticky, the fish was cold, firm and tasty, the rolls that had tempura waa freshly made, evident from the crunch and warmth of the tempura as you bit into the whole roll. My favorite had to be the roll with fresh tuna and roe. The roe just pops as you bite into it. In all we ordered 5 different rolls and spent over 80 with tip. I don't usually spend this amount for so little food and if I do it has to be spectacular. This place hit it out of the ballfield."

Actually, everything we've tried is delicious. The shishito pepper appetizer didn't disappoint (a personal favorite, which I often use to help gage the overall quality at sushi joints). I'd say this place is comparable to ever popular Katsu-Ya in LA.\n\n- HUGE MENU\nIt takes a while to peruse the entire menu and get a feel for the many specialty rolls - there's something for everyone.\n\n- LOCATION\nI like the fact that this is an off-strip, \"locals' favorite\" type of place. \nVery cool, un-touristy crowd.\n\n- PRICES\nIts surprising to know that so many people think this place is expensive. Haven't you noticed that EVERYTHING in Vegas is expensive?!? In terms of sushi prices I'd say this joint is average, and the Happy Hour prices are a real bargain!\n\n* WARNING *\nCHECK YOUR BILL!\nI'm docking half a point because the last time we were here they \"forgot\" to charge us Happy Hour prices, and gave us a bill with regular prices instead. NOT cool. Of course they fixed it when we spoke up, but if not for this incident Kaizen would be nearly perfect  :("

The funny thing is we sat at the bar and the place was not busy. I was blown away, but my friend and I were craving sushi after a couple of drinks, so we decided to go for it.\n\nWe ordered a couple of beers and a couple of rolls, which were about 14$ a piece (kinda pricey) but really didnt care because I wanted to let loose. The rolls were really good; in fact we ordered about 5 more between the two of us. \n\nOk, so here is the problem.\n      1.No interaction from the sushi chefs\n      2.The server had a piss poor attitude\n      3.I tried multiple times to get recommendations from server and chef with no luck....they just didn't give a shit.\n\nIve come to a point were i am so sick of incompetent people,uninspired people (hence the reason most of us yelp so we can find no bullshit, highly recommended places to go). Well the unfortunate thing about kaizen is that they have the ability to be great, but the service is just non existent. If this was an instance in which only the sever sucked, I could probably blow it off. But no, this was the whole fucking operation.\n    I will never come here again. I have never been so ignored or made to feel so insignificant at a restaurant in my whole life. I will give them 2 stars because the sushi was a sliver above average. Its a shame but the service was unacceptable. Oh and their prices just suck for what you get. Nothing but another glorified \"sushi restaurant\" in Vegas."

Aside from the fast service this was probably the worse sushi I ever had in Vegas. The rice in the rolls was a bit on the hard sticky side, and every time we picked a roll it immediately felled apart. The rolls were on the smaller side and did not justified the value of the higher prices. The fish didn't tasted very fresh, in fact there was a fishy after taste to it. \n\nI came to the conclusion that the sushi we had was pre-made and had been sitting in a fridge for a while. My suspicion came from the very fast serving after ordering it, literally 3-4 minutes had gone by and we got our first and second roll. Our third roll came in at around the 7 minute mark. The third sushi roll was hot and it tasted like it had been microwaved, probably why the wait time was longer. My fianc\u00e9 and I had the Philadelphia roll, crunchy roll...nothing crunchy about this, and lasagna roll. I was greatly dissatisfied with the sushi and have no plans of ever coming back here again."

The server said she accidentally poured two soups instead of one (claiming that the lunch special comes with one soup). She scored brownie points with that move. \n\nThe sashimi combination was alright. The slices of fish were decent. Not the Best sashimi I've ever had but it hit the spot.\n\nThe first kiss roll was pretty scrumptious. Not entirely sure what sauce it's served on top of but it was absolutely delightful. \n\nThe Tokyo roll looked scary. I've never seen a raw fish roll look so slimy before. But the server Shima informed us that there was a mustard ponzu dressing on top of it. Me and my boyfriend only ate half of the roll trying to stomach the unusual slime but the waitress insisted that she still discount the roll from the bill.\n\nTo make up for the Tokyo roll, our server brought out a deep fried green tea ice cream covered with whipped cream, cherry and drizzles with chocolate sauce. Never having tried this concoction, we were pleasantly surprised with such a treat. Thanks Shima!"

(I only go to vegas for work.)  this place is off the strip, across the street from the hard rock cafe/casino/hotel, in a corner shopping strip.  We asked our waitress (sarah) from Japonais inside the Mirage about a local place off the strip where locals go. She recommended this place.  HEY! Sarah great call thank you. \ni understand there's more than one location, lucky vegas residents.  i will be back to vegas (unfortunately), but now i have a place for sushi were the real people can go."

She did and ordered the Alaska roll which she said was really good. They have a great menu and I love how it's decorated. My only complaint is that sometimes the service is a tad slow, but they really do try their best, and that is ok with me. A lady next to me this last time was completely rude to the server but he didn't get upset and was able to pretty much turn it around, which was awesome.

While we were in Vegas for the long weekend, we had a late night (2am) craving for dinner and of course, almost nothing was still open except buffets and Kaizen sushi. Score one for the sushi joint. A taxi driver recommended the spot to me and I have to say he was on point.\n\nWalking in, it's a small place. But the decor is warm and inviting, as are the staff. They were playing music videos and tables full of people appeared to be having a great time doing sake bombs. \n\nTheir menu is HUGE. It's almost near impossible to make a choice based on all the yummy pictures and descriptions. But I settled on the Japanese steak and veggies (yummy shiitake mushrooms) and my friend ordered the albacore and the beef tataki (sp?) The food was so delicious that even as we stuffed ourselves silly, we made sure to wrap up the leftovers and take them back to the room. \n\nThe price was affordable, service was quick, knowledgable and friendly, and they called us a cab to go back to the room. And did I mention they're open until 3am? Kudos. I'm definitely a fan and will return next time I'm in Sin City."

I recommend the Salmon Skin Hand Roll or the Philadelphia Hand Roll, bare in mind that their hand rolls are pretty large! They also offer extremely fresh nigiri and they always have a special fresh fish for the day so be sure to ask! When they have special fishes for the day, they are indeed special because I cannot find some of these fishes at any other sushi restaurants. The Hamachi Kama is also a must, it's perfectly seasoned and grilled and it practically melts in your mouth. They are getting ready for a new location at the Linq so they have been training new waiters so be patient if you get one of the new ones! The sushi chefs are also amazing and have fun personalities if you're sitting at the bar. They like to drink, dance and sing while making sushi!

I waited... nothing changed. I wanted to talk with the manager, but apparently this guy is NEVER available. I called and went there in person several times with my bank statements printed out, none could solve the issue. Eventually spoke with the manager, who told me to send to his email copy of my bank accounts with the statement showing (like I have all this time to waste? Do they think Im making this whole deal up for 26$? What about giving me a free meal and PEACE OUT?). I did emailed him all documents...He NEVER answered back. Called again, he was not at the restaurant. I'm so pissed that I've wasted all this time and got robbed. It's just unfair. Be aware of how they treat their clients!"

The majority of sushi spots in Vegas are AYCE- and I'm fine going to a place that isn't, but the expectation is that the quality is higher. And while the presentation and service were good, the actual quality of product and freshness of fish seemed average.\n\nWhen ordering takeout, this spot is great about carefully packing up your order so each roll has it's accompanying sauces alongside- this allows you to control how much is used and prevents the rice from getting soggy on your ride home! \n\nMenu features a wide range of specialty sushi rolls, and some grilled items and apps as well. Nigiri oddly did not seem to to be that common here. The Kai roll was recommended by staff and the best of what we tried. \n\nNOTE: Takeout rolls noticeably smaller than what is received dining in."

No problem with that because after a long weekend working 14 hour days so we just wanted food!!! The chefs were standing around and after we put in our order they started cleaning up. After our appetizer came we received our bill to discover they didn't put in our order in for entree. We practically had to beg them to put in our entree order. Anyone makes mistakes and we understand its late but they're open until 4am so they should still serve us, right? As we saw the dread in the two chefs expressions, and saw how old the rice was we decided to cancel our order. The hostess lady was super rude and pushy, trying to push liquor even after I told her I can't drink. The monkey brains were good and the miso soup was yummy, would of been better if they weren't cheap and actually put more wakame and tofu in it. I honestly think if they raised the quality of service and dedicated employees. The workers need to realize that they work in hospitality and are dealing with people so need to treat them how they'd like to be treated.  -September 26th 3 am"

The place attempts at an identity; dimly lit rooms, walls and menus decorated in sleek yet simple design.  Bold and different from other sushi venues in Las Vegas.  Overall, not bad.\n\nEven the food is designed to look cute and all.  You may notice the sushi takes a little bit longer to prepare than other venues, and obviously it's because they're taking their time laying out and arranging the sushi to make it look nice.  Makes up for a nice Kodak moment if you're into that kind of stuff.  It's impressive, but the bottom line is that no amount of decoration can make a delicious meal.  The fact is, the sushi tastes bad. Really bad.\n\nTo be fair, the sushi may be OK for first timers or real causal sushi goers, but it just doesn't cut it for me.  The biggest reason is that the rice is terrible.  It doesn't mix well with the sashimi at all.  It's always because the rice is cooked too thin,there's too much rice in the roll, it's not packed correctly with the sashimi, the list goes on and on.\n\nThe fish is OK, but not mind-blowing.  The best way to find out if a sushi joint is good is to eat the most perishable fish on their menu.  I always try the Ebi(Shrimp), Ama-ebi(Sweet Shrimp), and Uni(Sea Urchin) as starters.  Try one of these as a Nigiri (Fish and Rice only, with no tacky sauce), and you'll know in a heartbeat if the fish is fresh or not.  It doesn't matter anyways because you shouldn't order Nigiri at a sushi joint that doesn't have AYCE unless you wanna put a hole in your wallet.\n\nThe price is pretty overpriced as well.  I know it's near the Strip and everything, but it seems that's all you're paying for at this point.  The food does no help to justify the price of the dishes.\n\nOh, I just want to point out it took nearly 20 minutes for them to prepare a California Roll.  Unbelievable.  I don't care if it looked pretty because when I'm hungry I can eat anything that looks close to edible.  The thought of waiting another 20 minutes was insane.   I can't imagine how much longer it will take if I ordered it during their peak hours.  If you go there around 10-11pm when they're busy, good luck ever getting your food..\n\nIn conclusion, considering that the food comes out looking pretty like a flower arrangement and takes a long time, its more like a lounge-like environment.  Go with a couple friends when you aren't too hungry, have a couple drinks and poke at the pretty food that takes forever to come out.  In that sense, it's an OK experience.  But as far as taste goes, stay awaaaay. \n\nPRO: Nice decoration, location is OK.  Sushi may be decent for casuals\nCON: Sushi tastes bland, dishes takes a really long time to come out, no AYCE"

We got seated really fast and we were kinda excited about the menu since there was a lot of variety. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 rolls since we usually get that amount of rolls at other sushi restaurants thinking it will fill us up. Once my friends and I got our sushi, we were pissed off because the sushi had like 4-6 rolls. We just looked at each other like are you freakin' serious? I had to order another sushi roll because it obviously did not fill me up. When we got our check, it was about $105 since it included gratuity already. My friends and I ended up putting $120 instead of $105 since none of us had change. So we're waiting..and...waiting for our change. The workers during that time were giving us dirty looks cause we were still there and probably wanted to clean our table. So it finally hit us, where the fuck is our change? We asked the lady if we can get our change back and she gave us a dirty look. That bitch thought that extra $15 of our \"change\" was her damn tip. Like really? The tip that was on the receipt was already $15. So this restaurant tried to get a $30 tip from my friends and I when there was only 6 of us. Really? $5 tip from each person when the food didn't even fill us up? Shake my head at those workers man."

I wanted to grab sushi, and not being a Vegas regular, knew I should check out Yelp to see where all you Vegas Yelpers are going.\n\nOur party of 4 got in relatively early for dinner, about 5:00 on a Sunday, and we were the only ones there. We ordered about 10 different rolls, and they were served at a well staggered interval. I'd say 8 out of 10 were delicious, the other 2 average. The tuna, salmon, crab and more were all delish and fresh. We stayed for a few hours, I think we left after 8:00 since we were eating, drinking and having a great time. The wait staff were great, and were in no rush to get us out the door. In fact, they made sure to tell us they were open until 4 AM...so I guess we could've stayed for a while!\n\nAmbiance was interesting. I dig the hip hop music and videos, and even though the place looks a little low budget inside, the food more than makes up for lack of decor. \n\nPrice was super reasonable, we ended up spending about $50 each, but that's with drinks, all of those rolls and a 25% tip. Great value. I will definitely visit this place again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Thanks Yelpers, for helping out a San Diegan in your fine city."

So disappointed.\n\nCame here around 8 on a Saturday night after Yama's Sushi had a 30 minute wait.\nSoon as we came, we were seated immediately which was good because we had a party to go to at 10.\n\nEach of my friends ordered a hot/cooked dish and a specialty roll; I ordered the chirashi (sashimi sampler on rice) because I didn't want to be too full for the night's festivities.\n\nIn 15 mins, my friends each got their cooked meal - seafood curry, chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki donburi. Told my friends to eat as my food was surely to come out soon.\nI watched my friends eat as I drank water; and watched more and more people come into the restaurant. \nBefore I knew it, my friends were done with their meals. And I started noticing that the groups of people that came after us were getting their sushi. This was about 30 mins after ordering.\nWe kept looking for our waitress for the next 5-10 minutes but, no one came into our section. We, finally, had to wave down the hostess to check on our sushi.\n\nMy friends' specialty rolls, finally, came. But, at that point, their food had already settled and they weren't hungry. \nFinally...after an hour of waiting, my food came. By that time, I didn't even wanna eat it.\n\n\nFor a city that has all these AYCE and stellar sushi spots, Kaizen should be lucky to be open. And with service like this; forget it!"

The very 1st day I flew into Vegas, my roommate Jef brought me to the Kaizen in Henderson and I automatically fell in love!\n\nKaizen is a very great sushi spot especially for one of the best HAPPY HOUR spots to go to after 12am-4am when your hungry and drunk! Can't beat a buy1get1 for Beer and Sake and $2 Hand Rolls!!\n\nWorkers: Very friendly staff and theyre always down to drink with you especially the chefs!! They always make sure you have a great time!\n\nMenu: Its SUSHI!! Its a bit pricey but its worth! Try it and let me know! \"First Kiss Roll\" is my favorite Special Roll on that menu.. Pretty much everything on the menu is a great pick and I always bring all my out of towners to this spot and they always ask me to take them back again!\n\nLocation: Right across of Hard Rock Hotel and down the street from the Macarran Airport! Cant ask for any better. Better than it being off the strip than on the strip or in a high end Casino!\n\nCheck it out!!"

It is a cool place with a nice atmosphere as far as sushi places go.\n\nIt is not an AYCE place and it will cost you quite a bit of cash if you eat like you are at an AYCE place, but the sushi is excellent and the staff is very friendly. I use to get sushi to-go from here all the time when I worked in the area.\n\nHighly recommend!"

I usually NEVER sit at the bar, but it looked inviting , and very casual, it was a friday night, around 11pm or so. They were playing techno music, I actually like the atmosphere. My date and I came in a for quick bite, and this was pretty fast and not very expensive. Both time that I have been there it has not drained my wallet for what i got. 1st time here i got a shrimp tempura roll ( 7bucks), not bad. and a cucumber roll(4 bucks). My date got the shrimp killer. ( around 8). Not bad at all. \n\nSecond time I went i ordered to go, and I got a vegetable tempura roll,(7bucks) which i found to be VERY GOOD! They put avocado in it. I tried the spicy scallop roll, but I did not care for it. It has some kind of a red mixture, somewhat like tomato. I dont know. I have had better. Everything else was very good!.\nShrimp tempura roll. vegetable tempura roll. scallop roll, cucumber roll all came out to 24 dollars to go. I know i dont order extravagant rolls but thats cause im allergic to some of the stuff in those. So for me veggies rolls are wonderful. Ill prob come back again, because they pay attention to my fish allergy.\nI come here alone sometimes after work, and I never feel weird. The sushi chefs talk to me, and they said they would remember my allergy if I came back, that makes me feel SO GREAT!"

Inexpensive especially compared to the strip and a good staff too. Also they are open until 5am so after a late night of drinking definitely the place to be."
