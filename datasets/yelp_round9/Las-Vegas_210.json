The rice was burnt, most of the trays were near empty and they didnt even fill them the entire time we were there. The 1 and ONLY staff was very unprofessional and over talkative without caring about service, not to mention ify music that you couldn't think over.. This place gets one  for not even caring about anything. This one is in the failing 90% for sure.. With better staff and service this place has a chance. THE FOOD WAS .... GET IT TOGETHER GUYS... GOOD LUCK."

My lentils were good but I've had them better elsewhere. I've never had indigestion from Indian before but am suffering horribly after eating here.  We gave them a try, there's better Indian in town so we won't be returning."

We ordered the Bombay Platter which sounded delicious but amounted to a small platter of over cooked meats on a bed of cheap chopped iceberg lettuce.  We ordered Paneer Tikka Masala but what was served tasted like burnt tofu sitting stop a bed of chopped iceberg lettuce.  No taste whatsoever here so don't waste your money or time.  India Palace remains my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas."

(Btw i am not a child, hence the kids meal is enough for an adult). My parents ordered the dhal (extra spicy). And it was spicy. They also ordered the butter chicken (extra spicy). Also spicy but delicious as well. Both come with naan and rice. My brother got the chicken nuggets and pizza he says it's good. Overall service was good hot what we asked for in a timely fashion. The waiters are very friendly. I loved it thought the food was traditional tastes very good. The theme was very modern and clean. Overall 4.5/5 rating just because it was nothing special tastes like good Indian food."

Better than Amber (SF based restaurant). \nVijay Deokar is an awesome chef! watch out for him.

            "review": "Urban Turban took us by surprise in Vegas -- we weren't expecting the food to be SO good, but it was! The owner himself is from Bombay, and so is the chef and between the two of them they cook up some delicious delights.\n\nOn our plate:\n\nKheema Pav - this is a dish similar to scrambled eggs, but made with beef or goat mince and served with a street style bread -called pav. This version was pretty close with what you get back in India... dry, seasoned well and non-oily. \n\nChicken tikka - real charcoaled grilled tikkas fresh from the grill - very delicious.\n \nChicken biryani - came in a pot sealed with dough, piping hot and very well done. Spiced to perfection, flavorful and great quantity. \n\nGarlic naan -  fresh and crispy \n\nPaan shot - this is a non-alcoholic after dinner aperitif. It is the liquid form of paan or betelnut leaf. It's become very popular in high end restaurants in India and great to see Urban Turban bringing it to us here in the U.S.\n\nOver all, this was a most excellent meal and could be a 5-star review if the restaurant sorted out its issues in the kitchen and with the service. Service is a little sketchy and seems they were having delays in the kitchen. Towards the end of the meal, we also felt a little rushed - would have liked to sit back and enjoy the last few bites of the excellent biryani and savored the paan shot, but didn't really get the chance to do that. However the staff seems really genuine and it would be great if they could figure out a way to iron out these issues. \n\nPRO TIP: If you're not sure what to order, chat with the staff or the owner Bhushan - they gave us great advice about not over ordering and and we were happy to go with their recommendations. \n\n**Used a Yelp deal - $12 for $20**"

Not only were the prices decent but the staff was very friendly. My friend and I dropped by and sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice but what really got me hooked was the manager, Raj. He was very personable and really wanted to know how you were doing. It's nice to be able to go into a restaurant and chat with a manager or owner that has real passion for the place. He took his time to explain every dish for us as we didn't know anything. I got the Chicken Tikki Masala with a glass of white wine. It was delish! Going again next week for ladies night!"

One day no food on buffets, people have to wait, another  day an excellent service and food!!! \n\nHad guests over from Dallas, told them so much about \"Paan Shots\"... Wish had not!!! Took them there a week ago on Monday afternoon  around 3:30pm.  First of all, place was closed but the Bar was open.  When asked the bar lady, she said \"I don't  know why it's  closed!!\" And remind you, bar is owned by restaurant  and same owner (correct me if I am wrong). She asked what do we want to eat? My wife and I told her we were here just for Paan Shots, but will come later.  She said (and I quote) \"I know what it is, I can make them for you!I make them all the time!\" So, we said OK... \n\nAfter 5 minutes,  came 4 shots of Paan.  Glass were right size, quantity was right but the color looked bit off...but I thought because of ambian light!!! Had thick ice cream or whipped cream in it....Tested horrible....we all just took ONE SIP...couldn't  finish it....not only we were embraced but also disappointment  our guest! When we (my wife and I) told the lady (bar tender) she said (and I quote) \"...these are always like this. I make them all the time for anyone who orders them.  No one has ever said anything!\"  First of all, the Paan shots we had in past would actually taste like liquid  Paan, had rich dark green color, beautiful aroma and tested so damn good that we would always end up  ordering 2nd round.  This time we could barely take one sip! \n\nWe paid and left.... But seriously  what ever you have it going... please get a grip..."

To all my vegan and vegetarian friends out there, keep reading!\nLast night I told the owner, Bhushan that I really have been slacking in my efforts to transition from a vegetarian to vegan.  He said that was not a problem.  Now, they have vegan items on the menu but he knows how I need to feel special so he went into the kitchen, spoke to Chef Vijay and told me they were on it.\nI do not remember exactly what everything was called but for an appetizer I had what I describe as sweet garlic mushrooms.   The best way I can describe them is they looked like sweet and sour chicken but less sweet and sour and of course cruelty free.  I was blown away and full but then the main course came out. My biggest regret is that I did not stop right there and take a picture because I dug in right away destroying the presentation that made my eyes bug out.\nThere was some neatly sliced iceberg with large fresh tomato slices.  Partnered with Basmati vegan rice that looked like fried rice but it was imade with Indian spices NOT soy sauce ( I think).  It was the best rice I have ever had. Really.  Light and fluffy but complex and intense in flavor at the same time.\nTo round off the plate there was what I can only describe as a type of blooming onions.  They were more blooming tulip maybe calamari looking and again, the best I have ever had.  Cruelty free food that looks AND tastes amazing.\nI know, I have set the bar high.  I balanced out this meal with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.  Hint: first timers tell them you read on Yelp that you could get a free glass of NZ SB with a $20 order and they will accommodate you!\nOf course I was not able to eat it all so I sit here in bed eating my leftovers.\nThe only bad thing was it was cricket night so the bar was packed with men.   Wait that is a positive as well, LOL!\nThanks Ed, Manish and Ronaldo for the great service."

            "review": "I've been here several times now, and I'm a happy and loyal customer.  I've had dinner twice (ordered off the menu) and lunch once (the buffet).  No surprise, but the items prepared to order off the menu are better than the buffet, even though there's nothing wrong with the buffet at all.\n\nThere's lots of room inside.  The tables are small and can be pushed together easily for larger groups.  Note that it can be noisy.  The floor is bare and the tables and chairs make \"that noise\" when moved across the floor.  (You know, that metal or plastic on concrete kind of sound.)  Without carpet or something else substantial to dampen the sounds, voices carry, everything echoes, and when there's more than a few people, it can sound noisy.  Not a problem, but worth noting if you're looking for a more intimate or quiet meal.  I think there's also a private group room, but I'm not positive.  Overall, the place has a sort of urban feel rather than the look and feel of a thoroughly traditional Indian restaurant.  Don't worry about that though.  The food is what you're there for.\n\nThe buffet has a decent assortment of dishes, most of them popular standards, so you won't be disappointed if you want to make a quick run for Indian food.  The full menu is wonderful, with a great assortment of menu items with chicken, lamb, shrimp and fish.  There are also vegetarian and vegan options.  The appetizers are delicious too, and there are certain dinners served prepared for sharing.  \n\nI recommend trying these:  for starters go for the Mushroom Sweet Garlic, the Lamb Kebabs (to share), or Gun-Powder Shrimp, then move on to the Chicken Tikka Masala, or the Bombay Fish Fry for the main course.  If you're in a curry mood, be sure to check out the Himalayan Chicken.  Take note, you can tell your server how spicy you want your curry.  By the way, don't look past the Paneer Tikka Masala (made with cubed cottage cheese instead of meat).  It's delicious!  Regardless of what you order, try the Garlic Naan to complement your meal and to mop up the delicious sauces.  Being full at this point, I've never made it to dessert, so you're on your own there.\n\nEverything was top notch during the two dinner visits.  Both times we were treated by a hostess who was cheerful and kind, welcomed us to the restaurant with genuine warmth, and quickly seated us.  The waiter each evening (a different guy each time) weren't pushy, but took care of us quickly.  They introduced themselves, talked about menu choices, offered suggestions, took our orders carefully and brought out well-prepared food that was presented nicely.  Our glasses were never empty and as we slowed down, they ensured we knew to-go boxes were available.  I really wish I could remember the two gentlemen's names.  I wrote them down and have since lost the note, but they were great: the kind of waiters any restaurant would want to employ.\n\nMy recent visit for lunch was a bit odd though and the reason this isn't a four-star review.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the main door was locked with a sign on it pointing to the right and telling customers to use \"the first door\".  Just down the front is the other door into the restaurant.  That door had a sign on it pointing back to the main door, telling customers to use it instead.  Both doors were locked.  Just then my friend who arrived ahead of me opened a third door, farther down to let me in.  The whole door game was awkward.  I would have figured it out in another few seconds (there had to be another door), but apparently the management didn't think it was important to put new signage on what ended up being the middle door, ensuring customers were easily aware they needed to continue down the storefront to the less obvious third door.\n\nIt was 1:00pm and the restaurant only had a few other people in it.  Apparently we missed the main lunch crowd, meaning a quieter lunch and great service was upon us.  The waiter came across the room as we sat down, was quick to take my drink order and confirm we wanted the buffet.  Once that happened and for the rest of the time , he looked and acted as if it was an inconvenience that we were there.  Frankly he looked angry, and acted like it took all his self control not to tell us to hurry up and leave.  Truly it was almost uncomfortable with all the angry looks, and glares.  I thought maybe we were up against an after lunch closing time but on Thursdays they open at 11:00am and serve continuously until 11:00pm, so no issue there.  We were well-behaved and both of us showered, so I'm at a loss why the waiter seemed to have a problem with us.\n\nSo I stand by the dinner experience as normal and suspect the lunch experience was just one of those days.  There are more trips in the future and if it proves that the lunch experience was an oddity, I'll quickly bump this review up to four stars.\n\nEnjoy!"

I found the food to be decent overall with more subtle flavors than other Indian places I've eaten, but pleasant just the same. The buffet consists of 2 steam tables with the typical staples you'll find on other buffets. My only gripe is the some of the chicken in the tikka masala had really tough crusty ends which I suspect could come from it being cooked in the tandoor.  Fine for tandoori chicken, but not so much in the tikka.  The garlic butter naan was also very tasty and even requested a second basket. \n\nA good experience with helpful and friendly wait staff.  Noticed they also have a happy hour with some good deals; must check out."

            "review": "Let me start by sharing that my experience with alot of Indian restaurants hasnt really been the best so when i walked in here; though on high recommendations, i was still a bit unsure of what to expect but boy were we in for a surprise! We were greeted by the sight of an autorickshaw (tuk tuk) yes an actual full size one from India! .Once seated by a cheerful steward, we started with some chicken tikka & cream cheese tikka appetisers which were succulent and well accompanied by some tangy Indian chutneys, a mint sauce and papadums. First big tick for me.\nFor mains we ordered the butter chicken and lamb curry with naan and jeera rice (tweaked to the Indian palate with some spice by the chef who came out to greet us at our table) Both top notch but what needs super special mention is the naan bread.. Havent had them so good even in India... The Garlic naan gets a double thumbs up for sure(again recommended by the ever smiling chatty chef - Tarun) \nAt this point im thinking.. Wow this is going well.. Great food and an ambience that definitely has thoughtful touches of Mumbai and India...so close to home! \nSo last but not the least.. We come to the best part of the meal, which for me is always the dessert... Now i must mention here that most Indian restaurants (no offence to anyone) pass off absolute unauthentic rubbish as much-hailed regional delicacy desserts from India but what u get is something very pale in terms of presentations & taste and sometimes the result of indigenious modifications to recepie. We went with the gulab jambuns topped with rabadi. In one word - fantastic (a special for that evening - again recommended by the chef or the 'smiling assasin' as i later thought of him while mentally planning my gym trips to burn off the excess indulgents on my way home) So now while my 2 guests and I settled our bill and were dicussing that only a paan could top off a meal like this and wham.. Out of nowhere comes the hospitable owner who seemed to revel in the fact that we enjoyed our meal so much that he sent us a round of paan shots.. Apparently one of their best selling desserts. I was so pleasantly surprised that i decided to do this detailed review in Yelp!  A must visit place on the Vegas bucket list... Guess what.. Im back here to try another couple of dishes for lunch which have arrived! So enuf with the review.. Im tuckin in! \np. S : Big Kudos to the UT team!"

I didn't think I would like curry but this one was not overpowering and it is bottomless so the server informed us if we didn't like the one we chose we could switch it out.  I enjoyed the flavoring of my curry however the chicken seemed fatty with unedible pieces in it.  With our yelp check-in we recieved a free glass of either red or white house wine!  It was great.  The restaurant was dimly lit however we were sat near a drain which was making un-appetizing sounds the entire meal.  I'm glad I tried Urban Turban but I don't know that I would be back."

And I guess with a name like Urban Turban, it definitely fits the bill. There's a hip bar area up front, and these retro metallic cafe chairs, modern lighting, open kitchen, and a rickshaw up front....ridiculous! \n\nWhat I've come to realize about LV dining is that authenticity is not the name of the game...but taste certainly is. And Urban Turban has some really delicious food! The curries are well balanced, creamy and with just the right amount of kick. The garlic naan is soft and chewy. The Samosa's were gorgeous (looking) and tasted just as good as they looked. And this Lamb Sheekh Kebab was sooo flavorful. So even if it's not \"real Indian food\", it's still really good food. AND if you order the bottomless curry, they will send you home with extra bowls of curry :D The fat child in me rejoices!!!  \n\nAlso, I kinda hate on the idea of a bar in an Indian restaurant, but the bar here is pretty darn awesome.

I've tried many of the standards, and while I've enjoyed them on occasion, when I visit again, I am sometimes left disappointed. This has not been the case with Urban Turban.  \n\nOn my most recent visit, I had the lunch buffet for the first time. While it was slightly more expensive than I expected (comes in at $11.95) I was glad it included naan. There were a variety of selections (for the vegetarian and non-vegetarian) and the quality seemed to match that of their entrees I had enjoyed previously. (My favorite is the butter chicken). \n\nThe wait staff is always very friendly and helpful with their suggestions. On my last visit the owner stopped by and made a point to learn my name and that of the friend that I was with. That doesn't happen very often. He was also excited to learn that we were both locals. Apparently locals do not visit as often as tourists do. \n\nI am definitely looking forward to my next trip to Urban Turban."

Service was friendly and fast. The manager, a recent LV transplant from Cali, was very cool & welcoming too.\n\nWhile the space and service were nice, the food was just okay. Starting with the good - pav bhaji was yum. The flavors were on point and the bread was authentic. I'd definitely recommend it. The not so good - samosa chaat left a lot to be desired. The chaat presentation was amazing (probably the best we've ever seen) but the flavors weren't authentic. Since it's a chaat, we were disappointed that the chickpeas were missing from the mix too.

However, unlike the other spots, UT offers a totally different experience than what I have come to expect.\n\nEven as the name suggests, Urban Turban is not your typical Indian eatery. The interior is modern, no Bollywood music and the menu is totally different. First off, the curries are bottomless. I had the butter chicken (which was delicious) and you can order as much of it as you want. If you get enough people ordering different curries, you can essentially have your own AYCE Indian buffet right on your table. With that being said, the plates are not family style but individual portions. The mango lassi and samosas were on point. As with most Indian restaurants, UT features a pretty sizable selection of vegetarian entrees. The staff and service was great, and there is a pretty good drink menu as well. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the mood for Indian food."

When Scruffy returned (with no response about the special, mind you), my friend, who is very matter of fact by nature, told Scruffy we want the other waitress to serve us. Scruffy looked very hurt and surprised (why?), mutters an OK, and then walks away. Of course, she doesn't bother letting the other waitress know of our wishes. We had to flag the other waitress down, who was just a gem.  So knowledgeable, friendly, upbeat, charming, and helpful.  Didn't catch her name, but she is Gujarati and grew up in Orange County, CA.  It was a shock to find out she was relatively new to waitressing as she was a natural.  We were headed for a dining disaster, but she quickly put us on a U-turn.  It's like we were in the back of a tuk-tuk and she was our driver. We hung on and she took us for a ride.\n\nThe complimentary Indian \"chips and salsa\" was so nommy.  The chips were so flaky and light and crispy. The dipping sauce was a unique, Indian-inflected blend, unique but still familiar somehow.  Salsa but not salsa.  I could've eaten a whole trough of it.  Our new waitress recommended awesome cocktails. I had the Bourbon Turban. It's a keeper!  I normally don't like bourbon, but I'm certainly a fan of this South Asian concoction.  My friend and I decided to share the combination tapas platter. Everything was delicious, especially the shrimps and the paneer.  Everything was seasoned to perfection. I only wished that the food was warmer. It was a little on the tepid side when it was brought out and got cold quickly. It was all still tasty.  Even the garlic naan was only slightly warm. Is this normal for Indian tapas?  I'm not sure. I just know my own preferences. Maybe it was an off day.\n\nI would definitely come back here. They've managed to make Indian food tasty, trendy, and fun and fuse a little quirkiness into it.\n\nTo the management: get rid of the scruffy white chick, promote the adorable Gujarati girl (or find more like her), and keep your food hotter, please!"

            "review": "Michael, Norm and I came here to try out this new Indian restaurant to see if its as good or better than other Indian joints in town (i.e. Mint, Saffron, Mt. Everest, etc.). Las Vegas restaurant scene is very competitive, particularly when you are located next to many good choices.\n\nI am sad to say that Urban Turban didn't live up to my expectations. It's a really good concept to do a pseudo Indian fusion, but on many of the items we tried, it frankly falls flat on some of the dishes. Here are some of the things that we tried.\n\nAppetizers\n\n- Dry Fruit Bread - Hardly any raisins, but i'm not sure if sweet naan works with curries. \n-  Samosa Chaat - Big Samosas, they're flakey, but the filling was ok, it needs more spices.\n- Lamb Bhaji Pav - Its minced lamb meat with peas and other species, probably the best appetizer I've had here.\n- Paneer Tikka - I'm not the paneer fan, but the tandoori sauce really brought out the flavors in the paneer pieces. Another must try if you like Paneer.\n- Bhaji Pav - Needs a lot of work. It was tasted like something that Gerber scientists cooked up. Plain, no flavor and overpriced.\n\nMain Entree\n\n- Butter Chicken - The sauce was little too sweet, but it was packed with flavors. The biggest issue here was that there were hardly any meat in the curry. \n- Bombay masala lamb - curry lacked flavor, spice, and meat. \n- Five Herb noodles - my dinner partners loved it but I really wasn't a fan. It was hard to get the herb flavor and it just doesn't go well with Indian curries (Noodles are not Indian, Indo-Asian Fusion may be). \n- Butter Naan - same as any place\n- Basmati Rice - Fragrant and delicious, but nothing new (its hard to mess up rice, unless if I'm cooking). \n\nDessert\n\n- Paan Shot - Must try dessert, cheap and full of flavor. \n- Chocolate Samosas - It's unique, but nothing new. It's also very messy item to eat if you are sharing with others. \n\nService\n- It was good, the servers were very attentive, but they did mess up our naan and  other condiment orders. I think having some Indian servers can help the business since they can explain the variety of indian food they offer here. \n\nParking\n- Lot is was pretty empty, I think since Firefly (AKA - LV Salmonella Factory) got closed. If you have a car that's been lowered be careful and drive slow there is a steep gradient where you can do serious damage if you are driving too fast (Look for the sudden dip sign). \n\nOverall, its an interesting place, but the food quality needs to improve to even consider this place with good Indian restaurant. \n\nAlso, I read through lot of the reviews for this location, but I find the review by John L. to be very suspicious. He opened his Yelp account in December 2014, wrote the first review on 12/30/2014 and gave it 5/5. Also, the review looks like a PR(or a manager) guy wrote it from a customer perspective.\n\nOverall 2/5."

The place was about 15 mins from the strip and i'm not quite sure why we made the drive all the way to Urban Turban that night. But definitely glad we did:)  It's dimly lit and was super clean and tidy. \nWe arrived for dinner around 8:30pm ,and the place was so dead! The bar and the dining hall were both same and it worried me a little. BUT that meant we got seated right away, and the food came out pretty quickly after ordering . We ordered the Manchow soup , chili basil chicken bites, the Bombay Tapas Platter and  the bottomless Bombay lamb masala curry. The food was seriously amazing!  \nThe manchow soup was insane, and probably my fav. If you like curry and spicy Indian flavors you just gotta try it. It definitely has a kick, and I mean it'll make you sweat (and I eat spicy food every day). The Chili basil chicken bites were soooo good and those went so quick. The Tapas platter was also really good and included chicken tikka, lamb kabobs, Basil chicken, paneer and 2 kinds of shrimp. It came with naan as well and we both enjoyed it all. The basil chili chicken was so perfect, along with the tandoori shrimp. We got a bottomless Lamb dish as well, and that was just okay. The curry was good, but came with very little meat.They refill the curry but not he meat :(  Thankfully we had plenty of other food, and if we had just ordered the lamb curry this review would be very different. lol  \nOverall, we would definitely come back to Urban Turban!

I'm sure it's available elsewhere, but I'm not generally asked beforehand and whatever is readily available is what gets brought out.  \n\nWhat really made this place a standout was the courteous service and how well I was received by Mr. Bhushan, one of the managing owners.  I came in a little after 10pm one night because I had gotten out of a late work group meeting, was hungry, and the mood struck me while I was passing by on Paradise.  I asked if I would have too late to place an order and if it would have to be carry-out.  Mr. Bhushan overheard and intervened.  He came over and told me that if I wanted to place an order and dine-in, he would make sure the kitchen got it out quickly and that I was more than welcome to stay, especially since the restaurant still had to be closed up properly and prepared for the next day anyhow.  \n\nI didn't feel rushed at all, and the food came out quickly with no sacrifice to the quality of the dishes.

We get here at 10:29 pm (one minute before they close) and we asked if we would be able to eat.

He constantly checked in with us to make sure everything was okay. \n\nAnd I'm gonna be honest here, that this place had some of the best Indian food I have ever tried. The chicken biriyani, Tikka masala, and goat curry were impeccable. The golab jamun was also delicious. The best part is that they had paan in liquid form (whaaaaaat!!!) But as skeptical as I was, it was a refreshing and yummy drink! \n\nAlso the decorations were kick ass. \n\nYou guys need to check this place out."

One of the items was simply sliced onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. There are so many great Diwali dished they are missing, and the food that they made for the buffet was not very good. Some of the food was even cold. Being that I have been to India during Diwali before, I have a great idea of what Diwali is like and what the food/street food is like. This was a poor attempt to give an impression of Diwali street foods. During Diwali, there are a lot of sweet foods eaten. This restaurant did not even provide a single gulab jamun. No sweet foods at all. That is the least they could have done. There were other customers at the restaurant who were also excited to try the buffet and were shocked to see the terrible variety. This is not a \"mouth watering buffet\" as described, and it is not fair to call such, a buffet. Due to the poor selection of Diwali food, I would NEVER go back to the restaurant. I had high expectations seeing a vast amount of great reviews. If you are going to make a \"miniature selection of foods\", please do not label it as a dinner buffet as that is a misleading term, and I left to go and eat a REAL DINNER, afterwards. Also, if you are going to serve very few items, please atleast do it well. They did not even serve the basics, such as basmati rice or naan. They were also OUT OF mango chutney, another basic item. Mt. Everest buffet, Origin India, and Taj Palace are way better. I hope this place has good food on a normal day? Extremely disappointed."

Creamy?! \nChicken biryani was spicy, flavorful and had nice presentation. \nNaan- under cooked and warn at best when served. \n\nDrinks \nOrdered Tamarind margarita- was Ok \nBeer on Tap(Stella) OLD and simply nasty(has nasty smell)\n\nService\nthe server was friendly and that is why I gave my review 2 STARS.

I could hear arguments between servers and cooks. There was a table who must have waited 45 minutes for their food and then they received partial order. When they were leaving the gentleman stared conversation with me and recommended me to try Delhi restaurant instead. He also stated he is friends with the owner who kept inviting him to try this place so he did and was leaving disappointed. He also shared that the same owner owns a restaurant in New Zealand. \n\nWould I recommend this place- NO!"

I was with some family & friends so I had the opportunity to taste some other appetizers & main dishes as well. Butter chicken pizza?!?  OMG. It was good!

Good thing I know what most foods are. I also saw that certain dishes they load up like the chicken tikkas and they sit out drying under the lamp. They definitely need to up their game when operating a buffet. \n\nFor the prices they charge for items they can afford food labels properly printed and even detail what each dish actually contains in buffet for allergy purposes \n\nOn the positive best butter chicken and raita in town.  \n\nWe also noticed that their naans and well the whole menu is over priced.

So let me tell you that the food they serve here is nothing how it tastes like in Mumbai.\n\nI went there for dinner a few weeks back with my husband excited to try their food. But our experience was an utter disappointment.\nWe reached the restaurant at 6.05 pm and were seated immediately. Then started a long wait for service. It was only at 6.25 pm that the attendant visited out table and that too after asking around twice for some service. And to top this, he placed this order in the kitchen at 6.38 pm and we know this because their kitchen is not sound proof.\n\nNow I can live with poor service, but that clubbed with mediocre food is a recipe for disaster.\nWe called for a plate of VADA PAV to begin with. This dish has been my staple food for the last almost 3 decades and this was definitely one of the worst ones I've had so far. The Vada was cold with hardly any flavor. The lassan chutney was okay. The Pav was the only saving grace of the dish.\n\nNext came in the LAMB KHEEMA PAV which was good to be frank. Not the best I've had, but tasted good enough. Although I had pieces of ginger in my mouth a couple of times which was a little disappointing.\n\nWe got the VEG. KORMA with NAAN for main course. The vegetables were not fresh and seemed like those frozen veggies we get at supermarkets. Also, there weren't enough of them in the dish - less veggies and more gravy. The Naan was rubbery and not too great either.\n\nFinally after the disappointing meal we got up to leave and that's when the manager came to us to ask how our experience was. We told him the truth about our experience and he got extremely defensive. He also promised that he would refund the dinner amount, which he obviously did not.\nI don't think I would ever recommend this restaurant to anyone."

            "review": "A solid 3.5 star from me.\n\nMy friend and I decided to dine at Urban Turban last night just to see if it was any good! Plus we haven't had Indian food in a while ... and it's new! We love trying out new places to see how they are compared to the ones we always go to! \n\nUrban Turban gives a very modern feel when you first enter the restaurant. The establishment is quite big, their dining area and their bar area is actually separated which is pretty nice. Though, I would've never thought that Urban Turban would be an Indian restaurant if it weren't for me seeing them on yelp and/or the writings on the walls. Everything about the establishment was modern ... like it's American. It's a nice change from the typical Indian restaurants though..\n\nAside from my friend and I, there was only one other party in the dining area. Therefore, the service was quite prompt and very friendly. Our server gave us suggestions on what to order and what he liked from the menu. I actually do appreciate a knowledgeable server, especially when the establishment is new. It typically means they know how to train their employees (and feed them of course) !!\n\nWe thoroughly looked at the menu...they had some classics and they had BOTTOMLESS CURRIES. You know what that means! It means unlimited curry for whoever ordered them. However, naan and rice are not included in this all you can slurp curry goodness. \n\nI ended up choosing their chicken tikki masala. The server gave me a little warning that their masala was tomatoe based so it is kind gravy. I was a little hesitant about that cause when they say it's tomatoe based, it tends to be on the tangy side but what the heck..I really wanted to try it. I also mentioned how I like my food spicy and the server responded with how they will take care of that. My friend, on the other hand, ordered one of their bottomless curries: himalayan chicken. \n\nThe food came out quickly, which was nice. The chicken tikki masala did have a nice gravy texture to it, which I did like. I don't typically like my sauces very watery if I have it with rice. The sauce wasn't tangy at all even though you could taste hints of tomatoe base but it was sweet. The sweetness of it kind of threw me off. On top of it, it had a bit of a kick to it. I enjoy the level of spice they put in it...it was enough for it to make a presence but not enough for me to say spicy. \n\nThe chicken in the curry was amazing. Every bite was tender and juicy. It was probably my favorite part of the dish. The rice was very fine .. it was a little odd because I'm eating it but it feels like I'm not eating it. I know, perhaps it's me that's odd. I do like the rice though but I had to make sure not to mix too much sauce with it. With how fine the rice is, it could easily drown in the sauce then I'd just be eating the sauce. The naan seems normal to me... \n\nOne thing I did notice was that my friend's Himalayan chicken curry was on the watery side. I guess I'm just so used to a thicker consistency with curry that his curry was a little odd to me. Maybe that's just how it is! I'm no expert on Indian food ... so I guess you can start disregarding my whole review HAHA!\n\nAs for dessert, we both had a paan shot, which was one of the things that many reviews suggested. My friend liked the shot cause he said all he could taste was cream. However, it is definitely NOT my cup of tea. Yes, it was like a milk/cream type of drink and then it had a herbal-floral note at the end of it and that was like a huge stop sign for me. I simple cannot consume that type of flavor. I gave the rest to my friend (: \n\nWe also got to have a few words with the general manager of the location. From what he's told us, they do make the dishes as they are ordered so you can absolutely customize the dish to your liking, such as wanting it to be more spicy. Also, their food is like Indian food for the American palette, which I suppose you could consider Urban Turban to be Indian fusion. \n\nI would also just like to say that our server was amazing and the service he provided was awesome. He was very friendly and very willing to start a conversation with us at any point of time. We really enjoyed our time there.\n\nOverall, it's decent food. Interesting twist. The quality of the ingredients is definitely better than some of the other Indian restaurants that I've had. However, the price point was definitely a negative from me. The chicken tikki masala at almost $17 and the himalayan chicken curry at $18...the prices are quite steep compared to a lot of other Indian restaurants in the city. Granted, the himalayan chicken curry is bottomless but rice is not included .. most people that I know would eat curry WITH rice so you'd have to order MORE rice if you want MORE curry. On top of it all, the dishes are made with the American palette in mind ... I would honestly like something more traditional."

The price of the \"lunch menu\" is slightly higher than I would prefer for a place I would otherwise patronize regularly.  I think a more economical lunch menu with slightly smaller portions would do really well.  Also, the man serving us was very pleasant...  When we called him to the table.  For only having two tables occupied in the whole place, it concerns me that the service was slow/unresponsive.  This is a new place with operational kinks to work through, but absolutely worth going to.  I'm adding it to the \"lunch rotation\" ... Even if the prices mean doing so sparingly."

I took a screenshot of it to be posted here but no option to do it. The manager then turned me down for it and that was all even after admitting it wasn't too clear. If I were the restaurant I'd eat the cost -  we're talking $4 here, not that big a deal. To top it off, I had my plate already ready since she said I could do that while she asked the manager and they threw it out! Not the best customer service and very unclear when posting Yelp offers."

            "review": "Urban Turban is a good choice for people that don't love Indian since they have atypical offerings like flatbreads, a dish consisting of fried chicken strips, sliders, and even oysters.  It would definitely work out for the kind of people that order only California rolls at sushi joints.          \n\nOur friendly, upbeat hostess gave us a window seat, \"for the romance\", although the outstanding view of a Toyota minivan in need of a wash and hungry CES attendees walking by didn't quite capture that feeling.  Maybe a Yelp quick tip like \"don't propose here\" is needed. \n\nAll jokes aside, the two of us were ravenous and came specifically for their \"bottomless curry\".  We were also eating vegetarian this evening and found only 2 choices of curry disappointing.  I went with the \"Dal Tadka\" for a solid dinner price of $10, which was basically a fancy lentil soup.  It was hearty (as much as lentils can be anyway) with nice mix of curryness and heat.  Since only the curry itself was unlimited, I did my best to conserve the naan ($3 for another) and basmati rice ($5).  For $8, I would have rather tried one of their interesting looking tapas.  It also took around 5 minutes (sometimes longer) for the next bowl of curry to come out.  I could see this taking even more time when busy, so that could potentially be a problem.  I was without carbs by my fourth bowl.  The waiter also informed me that I had broken the bowl record.   \n\nMy wife got the \"Palak Paneer Masala\".  That had decent flavor, but it was too soupy for my taste.  I would have preferred a standard saag paneer at any average Indian restaurant over this.                      \n\nDespite all this, I remain optimistic for future visits.  They have a full bar area with happy hour.  I can't think of another Indian spot that has a bar worth hanging out at.  Perhaps bringing more people and trying all the \"Bombay Bites\" would be a better way to go. \n\n2.874937278209019221 stars.  Round up!"

            "review": "Wow! There is a lot of Indian restaurants in town but wow! This place just blows them out of the water. You can get all kinds of fusion foods now away but Indian fusion is a first and a fun adventure to take your taste buds on. I had a meal that put me in a food coma. Try everything because it's all good. \n\nThe Bhel Puri dish; which ideal for vegans and veggie lovers; was perfectly spiced. Not doused in tamarind sauce but not neglected either, just a nice blend. The puri is nice and big so you can get it with almost every bit til the dish is done. Very little onion; which worked great for me since I am not a big onion fan but if you want just let the server know and they can make it with extra onion. This dish didn't look big but damn it feed four very hungry and big adults!\n\nThe Bombay platter dish is like tapas of a meat plate. Tandoori flavored shrimp, some very big shrimp! Lamb kabobs and tandoori chickens bits. All very good! The only draw back is the dish was $40 and does not come with bread. It makes up for this by being a huge dish and consumable by fingers and or hands!\n\nThe lamb curry is the softest lamb you will ever have! It's not very spicy but still very scrumptious. The bread is included with the dish and it's just as soft as the lamb. A definite must try!\n\nAs for desert you need to get a paan shot and chocolate samosa if you still are conscious! The paan shot has no alcohol in it and is just amaze balls, hell it makes obesity look like a great life choice. The chocolate samosa is like fried ice cream you eat at sushi places and you know what; it's just as good! \n\nThe service is amazing, if all places gave service like this you would think you are royalty. I am definitely coming back here once again there is too much to try in one sitting!"

But after seeing and tasting the best biryani ever, it all made sense.\nDo yourself a favor and get a pan shot (brilliant!!!) and a plate of the chocolate samosa.

            "review": "This review is purely for the weekday Indian buffet. It was good, but I've had much better at other Indian lunch buffets. My boyfriend and I came in at around 12pm on a Monday, and found the very open seating area to be very empty. During our lunch, only two other people came in to dine. A couple took to-go. I expect that it fills up later on at night, as there was a separate area for the bar.\n\nUpon first glance at the buffet, I immediately thought that the options were limited, but it ended up being just enough for me! There are plenty of vegetarian options. HOWEVER, the vegetarian options were bland for Indian food. Lacked strong flavors, and that's why I enjoy Indian food in the first place. I liked that they have papadum, which I don't usually see offered at buffets. I loaded up a whole plate full of these chips. Cripsy with salt and tang from the chutneys. May have been my favorite, along with the butter chicken. This was well seasoned and creamy. The butter naan was more like roti in that it was more of a thin, soft, and dense texture and lacked crunch. I enjoyed this. My boyfriend, on the other hand, said he prefers his naan crunchy and airy. The gulab jamun was not as milky as I had expected.\n\nTo conclude, some items were good, just not enough for me to give higher ratings. I'd be willing to Urban Turban again sometime (possibly for their tapas and American/Indian fusion dishes)."

Big disconnect between the quality of the food (superb) and the quality of the chairs/tables (dorm-style).  If you can leave your ambience expectations at home, however, you'll be in for a treat when you have a meal here.\n\nThe menu is quite manageable with reasonable prices, especially considering the generous portions.  We had butter chicken, paneer tikka, naan and a delicious appetizer of tandoori mushrooms, and I'd give a five star rating to each of the dishes.  The two entrees were beautifully presented and well spiced.  The naan was large enough for 2 people to share, and the mushrooms were insanely delicious.  We had an opportunity to meet both the chef and the owner.  Our server was attentive without being obtrusive, and he offered several additional spice options when the entrees were served.  \n\nI will definitely return.  I'm hoping there will be some ergonomic chairs available next time!"

We were first brought three papadum with mint and mango chutneys.  I liked both.  The mint had a good amount of heat to it unlike what I've had before.  \n\nNext up were:  dry fruit whole wheat bread, Samosa chat, lamb kheema pav, and paneeer tikka and pav bhaji.  There were two winners here--the lamb kheema and the paneer tikka.  I really enjoyed the grilled flavor of the paneer and the lamb had good texture ingredients.  The lamb was served with bun halves that you could make a slider if you wanted.  I chose to use it as a base for the meat.  One real miss here was the dry fruit whole wheat.  I thought it was garlic naan.  I could not tell that there was any stuffing of nuts or raisins in the bread.  \n\nFor the mains, we got two curries and the five herb noodles recommended to us by the owner as his favorite dish.  The curries were good with a small amount of meat in each one.  I expect that's why the curries are bottomless.  The five herb noodles were my favorite of the night.  Really good seasonings and something quite different.\n\nFor dessert, we each got a paan shot (highly recommended) and we ordered a chocolate samosa.  It reminded me of a dessert in a Mexican restaurant with fried dough and ice cream with chocolate drizzled over the dough and the ice cream.\n\nThe restaurant is very nicely done.  It's a modern room with wood tables and lights hanging from the ceiling.  Service was OK.  One must do is to take a photo of someone in your party in the rickshaw."

In last 6 years, of 100 times that we might have dined  at restaurants, this was 1st time that we did NOT leave any TIP for the servers at this restaurant--that much Crappy Service and Attitude they showed to us. As the saying goes \" As you sow, so shall you reap!\" Here's what happened...\nWe were seated at a little wobbly table. We were 4 adults. 2 tables were joint for party of 6. 4 on 1 table and 2 on other. Although, we didn't use the other table. On all the tables exact amount of glasses were placed and on our table, only 3 glasses were there. My sis-in-law's hubby had to ask for the glass of water! Then our server took the order and brought out 4 appetizer plates (small). My hubby had ordered Samosa chaat. We all tasted and hubby liked it. Then came 2 Paav bhajis. it comes in a separate steel plate. we got 2 paav, bhaaji and chopped White onions. 1st of all Bhaajis color was almost brownish black not orange or red! Looked stale or God knows how they got that color. Bread wasn't properly done and White onions the way they had roughly chopped, we do better job at properly chopping. They did NOT even give lemon/lime with it. When asked for lemon/lime and chopped onions (that my hubby wanted), they gave red sliced onions (looked stale) and lemon/lime. When I and my sis-in-law tried the Paav Bhaji, it tasted good though- NOT Great or excellent! My hubby had ordered Paneer Tikka Masala. His PTM came 1st and then Garlic Naan (1 Big instead of 4 cut pieces) and as soon as my in-laws saw that, they told server it was burnt for most part. Server started teaching my sis-in-law that in Tandoor oven, it will burn only and he had to tell her that chef can take it out little earlier that way it is not burnt!!! he took it back and I saw how chef inside the kitchen was laughing and said don't bring back! \nThere was another server whom I called and with attitude he came and I requested him to bring extra Bhaaji and he said tell to your server and walked away!!! Not even courtesy to call our server so that I can convey the message to her! Then When I and my sis-in-law tasted my hubby's Paneer Tikka Masala, it was tasting quite sour!!! Literally it felt they had squeezed lemon/lime in it!! Then the properly done Garlic Naan came. Nobody liked Paneer Tikka Masala as much. My sis-in-law's hubby had ordered Parda Biryani. It comes with Roti/Naan as Parda meaning a Veil. The Biryani container is closed with Roti. She didn't bring roti with Biryani and when asked she replied that as we do not like burnt Naans/roti, they did not give us at all..! Plus the Biryani was tasting Sour as well--as if they squeezed too much lemon/lime in it..! So with all their attitudes, crappy food and service, so pissed, we decided not to give them tip. \nIn addition, it felt like they charged us for 2 Naans although they had initially charged for 2 naans and we asked them to cancel it-1 Garlic Naan cost us $6.00. If you make 4 pieces of it, it will look same as other sized naans. \n1 Paneer Tikka Masala - $12.00 (Bad)\n1 Samosa chaat - $8.00 (Good)\n1 Parda Biryani Veggie - $12.00 (Bad)\n1 Big Garlic Naan - $6.00 (okay)\n2 Paav Bhaji- $ 19.00 (okay)\n\nTotal with Tax $ 61.65-not worth it..\n\nI would give it a Negative star if I could. The feel and decor is also no good. wobbly table! I had to place everyone's glass of water on the empty table by my side. \n\nPaneer Tikka Masala and Biryani was still left. Biryani almost 80-85% still in the container. we didn't even feel like taking it home!\nPlease DO NOT Waste Your MONEY and TIME at URBAN TURBAN! Reviews will be on Trip Advisor and Google Reviews and to my family and friends!"

For $18, chicken tikka masala and half piece of Naan bread and half cooked rice. I was hoping to see thick and tasty gravy but it was simply tomato juice with 4-5 pieces of boiled chicken.\nIn Egg Curry, 2 eggs were swimming freely and the daal fry has mustered seeds instead of cumin.\n\nWe paid $70 for three dishes and daal.\n\nI think the management needs to work on taste, pricing and proportion sizes because clearly they were slacking in this manner.

            "review": "Urban Turban is a restaurant based off an Indian Fusion Bombay Style restaurant in Auckland New Zealand - I don't really know what that means exactly but the food quality here is a little higher than your typical Indian buffet or dive spot.\n\nComing from the Bay Area, there's a lot of choices for good, cheap Indian food especially in Silicon Valley. In Vegas, the choices are noticeably fewer and I think a higher class of Indian food could catch on.\n\nHowever, I didn't find that my experience here was eye opening nor a particularly good value. The prices and stipulations with the \"bottomless\" curries were discouraging to me. The primary stipulation with the bottomless curry is that they aren't to be shared, and naan and rice can be charged if you want extra. That being said it was plenty of food, so if you don't come in starving, you'll probably be full after a plate of food.\n\nOne thing that was quite nice here was their rice. It was tender, non-sticky, and yet not dry at all. I had the Himalayan Curry. The chicken inside the curry was extremely tender and tasted of a higher quality overall than most other Indian food joints. My curry itself seemed a little watery, and while the menu said it was spicy, I couldn't detect much personally. The GM did come out and say if I had a problem with it, he would gladly bring me a spicier one but I was too full at that point.\n\nMy friend had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which, not being a curry, was not part of the bottomless deal - which is a bit of a bummer still. The naan was quite good, though nothing special in my mind.\n\nI don't really know what a good value is at a place like this - the atmosphere does speak to a higher level of quality, but the food on the plate wasn't so outstanding, especially when I compare them to a typical Indian restaurant. I'm curious to see how well they can do with the location and price point, but for now I will give them a barely passing grade."

The service was phenomenal. Very friendly staff! Food took a while, but I think this was due to the fact it was all made fresh. Everything we tried was great...they have a Paneer dish that was one of the best Indian dishes I've ever had. Give this place a try!"

My first impression of this trendy Indian restaurant is of their urban decor with Indian aesthetic. There is an auto rickshaw parked near the main entrance and a huge bar right behind it. The service is very friendly and the Vada Pav tasted authentic. \n\nMr. Bhushan, the owner of the restaurant, is an amazing listener. I just wanted to talk to him briefly about clearly distinguishing vegan food items on the menu and right away he sat me down and showed me the yet-to-be-released new menu with vegan, vegetarian, gluten free options. When I told him I am visiting Vegas as part of my documentary on Veganism, he was interested in learning more about me and my interest in the topic. I advised him on substituting butter with Earth Balance \"Butter\" because of its low calorie, no cholesterol and good fat properties, he immediately called his chef for taking note of my suggestions. We ended up talking for almost an hour about using meat and dairy alternatives simply because they are healthier, environmentally friendly and not to mention save lives of animals who don't deserve to die to feed our bellies. Customers are becoming more aware of the health risks and cruelty behind meat and dairy as well and almost all the restaurants in Vegas now have several vegan/vegetarian items on their menu. \n\nUrban Turban will be my go to place on my next visit to Vegas. You can go to Sin City and still not commit any sins."

Top it off they ran out of one of the meats that was supposed to be on the platter. Waiter said he would replace the meat with some other meat. Never got another meat to replace the missing meat and was charged full price for the platter. In addition, we ordered wine which the waiter forgot to put in . 30 min later we reminded him and 10 min later we were told they ran out of that wine. Please don't waste your hard earned$ here ."

For $12.95 you get some bread, choice of meals including tandoori chicken, multiple curries, and some side dishes. Food was fine, with nothing standing out in my opinion. \n\nService was okay, but considering how light the crowd was on a weekday, they could have done better. Overall I'd say the price was steep for what it was.  The food tastes and looked like any other Indian restaurant in town. Not sure why Urban Turban is so hyped up but I don't think the rating lives up to the food at all. Maybe their dinner and HH deals make it a worthwhile stop, but their lunch buffet was average."

It came with a huge butter nan which was very fresh and soft, as well as some rice.\n\nExtremely efficient and friendly service and the owner was great, anticipating my needs from across the restaurant and making sure I was happy.  The food was halal, which was important to me, and tasted great.  I noticed one of the starters was infused with vodka, so be careful when ordering if, like me, you avoid alcohol.\n\nAfter the meal I asked for the masala chai, worried that it might be overly strong like a lot of badly done masala chai, the owner assured me not to worry and the chai was turned out to be very good.\n\nThe restaurant has a lot of interesting vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, fast friendly service and great food, as well as an fun full size Indian rickshaw cab in the front of the restaurant :). \n\nI got a Yelp deal for checking in here for the first time $12 for food and drinks if you spend $20, felt slightly guilty as I would happily have spent more - recommended!"

I was enticed by good reviews and great pictures/presentation on yelp (Bhaji pav, vada pav, bhel etc.) but the place didn't meet expectations. I am a vegetarian so review below is around vegetarian items in their buffet\n\nGood:\n- The place has good decor\n- The staff is friendly and service was decent. They even accomodated my request for Garlic Naan instead of regular naan they have in buffet.\n- Buffet had large selection\n\nNot so Good:\n- I came for their chaat and street food items based on yelp pic but on reaching the restaurant, the owner kept insisting I opt for their buffet (which i unfortunately obliged). I should have seen this as a warning sign.\n- After seeing other order ala carte, I think many food pics on yelp are not real and taken from internet (all good pics were from a single yelper which raise another red flag).\n- The buffet had tons of items but quality was sub-par (somewhat stale and not as flavorful): \n    * Bhajjis were Average fare.\n    * Shahi Paneer was watered down. I could only see a few paneer pieces floating\n    * Bhindi masala was terrible. Bhindi was so chewy, you could skip your dentist visit and check your teeth's strength on this curry.\n    * Other curries were Potato curry and Cabbage. They don't go with Naan and I have seen many establishments serve it for cost cutting (vs. more complex/flavorful curries like malai kofta, eggplant bhartha etc.)\n   * Palak Mushroom - Excellent - this was the best part of meal\n   * Garlic Naan - Average\n   * Rice and Daal - Good\n   * Gulab Jamun - Average\n   * Cold Coffee - Good\n- The price of buffet was $19. I am not cribbing about cost and willing to pay premium for good food but this buffet was just like any other $10 indian buffets I have had at many other restaurants.\n\nBased on this experience, I am not sure if ala carte (chaat and street food) experience will be any better (esp. with fake pics) but can't say for sure till I try it. Although I am more inclined to spend my next $20 at a casino table as that may have better odds of me walking away happy than this place."

The buffet had some tasty selections such as the tender butter chicken... and the goat curry was a little spicier and had more of a (welcomed) kick than the goat curry I've had at Angara Indian Spice Grill. The buffet is $12 which is standard fare for Indian food buffets in Vegas. The Gulab jamun (dessert) (also on the buffet) are like little delicte pancake balls swimming in pancake syrup -- they are awesome\n\nThe BAD:\nI went here SPECIFICALLY because they have Pav Bhaji and almost NONE of the other Indian restaurants in town have this. For the uninformed, Pav Bhaji is a street food in Mumbai (a/k/a Bombay, the capital and most populous city in India), it is a curry that consists of mashed potatoes and tomatoes and a bunch of other veggies... Now, I'm sure (over there in Mumbai) Pav Bhaji is only like $1-$5... but here it 'says' it's $9.50 but when I got my check it said it was $10.95 (yikes!) -- Plus, it doesn't look like they made the rolls (literally the 'pav' in 'pav bhaji') from scratch... it looks like they just got some standard dinner rolls from a local grocery store and toasted them too crispy... I was expecting hot soft yeast rolls with butter on top... plus the portion size was disappointing seeing as how it's $10.95 (see my pics)\n\nThe naan (bread) -- which came free upon request with the buffet purchase --  was burnt and (practically tasteless) it tasted like old leftover crispy pizza crust... good thing it was free because if I had paid for it I'd be pissed.\n\nThe 'tandoori' chicken wasn't cooked authentically (see pics) as REAL Tandoori chicken is cooked in a tandoor -- a clay pot -- hence the name tandoori chicken... this was just grilled chicken coated in tandoori spices... so it was definitely missing some of that smokey flavor you'd get if you ACTUALLY cooked it in a tandoor -- the BEST Tandoori chicken I've had came from India Palace\n\nThe food on the buffet was good but the buffet was generally small when compared to other Indian buffets\n\nThis place is really dark... now, I've come to know that that's apparently 'the thing' in Indian restaurants (in India)... that dark ('romantic') atmosphere... but this was at 11 am in the morning and I felt like I needed a flashlight... kinda annoying.\n\nPortion size vs price is one of the main reasons Chinese food will always be a better choice over Indian food in Las Vegas"

Ok so yes he asked but fuck it they deserve this great review. The food was great and not a single item on the buffet was dry/tasteless/underwhelming. They take pride on their Nan. Supposedly they have a certain oven for this Nan which most others dont. I didnt see it but i did taste it and that was some damn good Nan. We went during a weekday but i was told to come back for the weekend as they had Seafood on the buffet line. It sounded very interesting. I Would recommend to anyone. Wish i remembered the servers name to recommend to others. He was a mexican american (i believe) medium sized gay guy. Sorry only description i could think of. He was the best. others who gave bad reviews should ask for him. im sure they would do a 180 on their reviews."

The first time was a great experience and the food was maybe a 4 out of 5 stars and service was great as the man told us about everything on the menu. On Tuesday, we went and we were told they were only serving buffet and we had to eat in a separate dining room because a tour bus had priority over us. I was like ok no worries your food is really good we will come back some other time. Today I called ahead and asked if they were serving buffet or a la carte and if a tour bus was coming, I was told it was a la carte and I should be fine no worries. I drove for half an hour to get there and was told by the manager that we had to leave in less than an hour because a tour bus was coming, I explained the situation and he was like ok...he got on the phone to speak to someone. By this point I was so irate that I was turned away twice in 1 week that I will never be going there again. This restaurant does not cater to locals or non-Indian people on tour buses. Please go to Mint, Ghandi or Saffron (Saffron Flavors of India being the best Indian restaurant in Vegas) for better food and service to locals and those who are not Indian tourists. You food was good, but not great and considering that Mint and Ghandi are right next door and have just as good food I would recommend them over you. It's a shame because I highly recommended you to my coworkers that now I have to tell them otherwise. \n\nThis is the response I got from the manager insulting me and calling me a racist and see my response below ---\n\nBhushan A: Hi \nMy name is Bhushan and I am the owner of Urban Turban\nReading your review I don;t understand what your issue is - you make allegations against us being benefiting Indian only - is uncalled for and racists. This is how I read your review a rant out of frustration, not a review on its food quality or service. YOu clearly like Saffron, Mint and Gandhi satisfy your needs, then why visit Urban Turban. We have failed to meet your expectation, in which area your review is unclear. It seems like there is motive to defame us - At Urban Turban we are getting to be the most popular Indian cuisine restaurant in Las Vegas, hence we get super busy - each day we are getting full - by locals and tourists - by All - no specific race dominates us - we welcome all races and people from all over the world. \n\nI am not sure how I can help you, apart from saying your choice  should be Gandhi or Mint or Saffron\n\nLastly, this review is unfair and a rant  - no comment on our food or service.\n\nThis is my response and now I am really infuriated--- A. I am the last person to be racist as I am Hispanic and a minority as well and I applauded Mint and Saffron for their service and food and they are owned by Indians so how is that racist. B. You do turn away locals and single parties to accommodate Indian Tour buses and turn away locals (that clearly shows your service) as they are more of a priority and your response clearly shows no customer service as the customer is always right and you should not insult anyone C. I said your food was good not great, please re-read my review and I even complemented the server we had the first time but your food was not the best and I am entitled to my opinion the first and only time we were served a party of two with no alcohol racked up a $120 in order to try everything and it was mediocre to good not great from the garlic naan to the rose petal ice cream to the chili paneer that was made for us upon our request. D. Your response just does not show any remorse by your actions or concerns of losing a repeat customer it just shows that you will do anything to keep a \"reputation\" that is nonexistent and shows no customer service. That shopping center has way too many other good options to eat at like Mareekech, Sushi Way and Satay which are far cheaper and your prices are expensive for tapas style Indian food. So before you call ANYONE a racist you should know your facts, having an opinion and telling the truth about Indian tour buses, which is a fact, is not being a racist so don't play the race card with other minorities that may fly against a white person but not another minority. You just ensured the fact that I will not be returning or recommending your establishment. Maybe if you stop turning away repeat customers you won't get reviews like this. Finally, yes I have Mint, Saffron (the best by far in Vegas) and Ghandi, I am entitled to give my review which I think is fair and your response just shows how your service was by getting defensive and calling someone a racist. FYI the second time I was there was at 7:15 and only two tables were occupied and I was told I would have to leave by 8:00 because of a tour bus, what the heck not even a hi or hello...that is why we left...and I called ahead! Also, Hash K. gave a similar review a couple of hours ago, just so you know it's not always about the food...service plays a pivotal role as well."

Not only that but the presentation of it was nice as well. \n\nThe downfall came when all the items were so spaced out in timing. Mind you, there were only two other small groups in the venue at the time so I was hoping for quicker service. Nonetheless, we got our food eventually.\n\nI love the modern ambiance and the mural as well as rickshaw in the front lobby when you enter. \n\nThe price point was a bit unexpected but most people found it reasonable, so maybe it's just me. Overalls great place to stop by for a quick snack or two with friends or family."

This place is clean, spacious and modern; a nice change to most outdated Indian spots I've been to. \nWe ordered two of the bottomless curry bowls - the Bombay Lamb Masala and the Palak Panner Masala. Both with large portions and Oh SO good! The lamb was tender, cooked to perfection and very tasty. I love the spinach base in the Palak Panner but if you're not a fan try this dish with the red sauce (a masala twist). \nI can't say enough of how much the friendly smiles and genuine spirit of hospitality made this visit so complete. I will definitely be back here when I get the chance. Highly recommended!"

            "review": "Okay, I normally give a long-winded, critical  review, especially given the three stars I feel my experience at this place deserved.  I feel like being less harsh than normal because 1. We may have just come in on a short-staffed night (which makes no sense because the ASD convention is going on and they're right down the street) and 2. They're brand-new and hopefully working out the kinks. \n\nWe walked in, no hostess immediately there to greet us and all other employees were in the dining room. A blue shirt-clad man arrives from outside to seat us, walks us to the dining room and halfway through, hands us off to a short female, who I can't tell if she is a hostess or server. She seats us. \n\n As I sit down, I notice a glass on my side of the table with a noticeable, half-washed off lipstick stain on the rim...... I tried to be polite and waited until she picked it up to pour water in it for her to notice it, as I didn't want to make her feel bad. She didn't notice and instead put it back in front of me. At this point, I was a little annoyed. I quietly asked for another glass as mine had not been washed correctly. She replaced it and filled it again, apologizing minimally for what I feel was a pretty bad flub. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later, we ordered the Chicken Tikka and the butter chicken flatbread, this time from the blue shirt man. My hubby likes to ask about the menu on our first visits to restaurants to get the best choice, but the man we spoke to seemed like he had somewhere to be and was rushed in his explanation. We spoke to him for about 3-5 minutes but didn't feel educated on the menu as it was pretty large. \n\nOnce we got our meals (20 mins later), delivered by a food runner, we were pretty much left alone. My water was empty for the majority of my meal, which is basically a medium sized chicken pizza. We drank from hubby's glass until his was empty, as well. \n\nNobody came to fill our glasses until the table next to ours got theirs filled- we asked for water and we were forgotten about. We only got water after the table adjacent got served, even though we waited about 25 minutes longer, by the short female. \n\nWe were then left alone again- dirty plates in front of us and all- for another 15-20 mins as everyone else continued to get served. \n\nWe had to flag down the short female again to order dessert (chocolate samosas and a paan shot) and she left without taking the dirty dishes. \n\nI asked for a takeout box which she forgot. Dessert comes and our dirty dishes are awkwardly cleared while the dessert is placed at the same time. \n\nWe eat the dessert (samosas were tough to eat- the bread-like pastry was a hard shell throughout). No more water came after the last fill. Once we finished, we sat for 20 mins more without being given a check, given a takeout box, or spoken to for that matter. \n\nThe short female comes along eventually and asks if we want anything else. We asked for the check, which she forgot. \n\n15 mins later we flag down the blue shirt man and ask for the check. He forgets. We double-check and ask again and he brings it quietly. We immediately put our card in in the hopes we could get out faster, and of course he rushes it back to us and attempts to say bye and thanks in a nice manner as we get our card back. We left a MORE THAN generous tip ($60.00 check for the two of us) after this sub-par service received. \n\nI really wanted to love this place- we have plenty of friends that had great things to say- but I just can't after today. \n\nThis isn't an angry review by any means to defame or to knock down this business- I just really hope that it's used as constructive criticism for future customers. Please train your employees on 5-star quality service- the service matters just as much, if not more, than the food, in my opinion. The service itself is a product of your business- it will speak volumes on how much you care about your customers. I hope things change -if- we come back."

We came for Sunday brunch which meant \"grand buffet\" and $18 per person.  The yelp check-in offer said free glass of house wine upon check-in.  After asking 2 staff members to honor the check-in, we were told it was not applicable if we wanted to eat the buffet.  That fine print was not on the offer, so we were a bit annoyed at the bait-and-switch.  The server brought us menus, but I did not get it - the buffet cost more than most entrees so why if we pay less do we get the free drink?\n\nSo no wine for us.  The buffet was okay - there was a lot of variety and even Indian eggplant but nothing stood out, no complex flavor profile.  The manager told us the buffet is \"grand\" because more seafood options but there was just one shrimp dish.  There were no small bowls or cups for the chutneys, which maybe was the only thing I liked that much.  The manager even tried to upsell Eric R. on tandoori chicken for the cost of an entree to \"add\" to our buffet.  There were definitely many options but I did not eat anything that was worth going back for in the future.  \n\nI'd say skip and go to Mint or another nearby option, as there are many."

our server not really offering much aside from the occasional water refill and dropping-off of plates.\n\nLocated in a small plaza off Paradise, just a minute from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino by car, Urban Turban is the sort of place one wants to like on entering, and with largely benign d\u00e9cor aside from the whimsical rickshaw sitting beside the hostess podium the focus seems to be on the food moreso than the scene - a wide view of a gleaming kitchen flanked by chalkboards revealing a number of Chef's working diligently on plates whose results would unfortunately prove average, at best.\n\nStarting off with appetizers before progressing to proper plates and curries it was with a trio of free Papadum that the meal began and with the flavor mostly that of oil it was thankfully the mango chutney that made the crisp pastry far more interesting, though the green 'mint' version was flavored much like bile - overly heated, viciously acidic, and not particularly something one should strive for in any sort of cuisine.\n\nNext served a quintet of plates that quickly covered the table it was with some confusion that I looked upon a menu item described as \"Dry Fruit Whole Wheat Bread\" and with neither fruit nor nuts evident I attest to this moment we were simply served the wrong thing, though the server assured us this was indeed the correct item.\n\nLargely ignoring the lack of fruit and instead using the 'whole wheat' Naan to scoop up the first bites of a duo of Pav, suffice it to say that unless one is vegetarian the Lamb version shows far superior to a more traditional take that serves as little more than muddled vegetable mush meant to be served on bread and turning attention to an impressive Paneer Tikka presentation with tangy cubes amidst earthy aromatics it was a thankful circumstance that the Samosa Chat was only lightly drizzled with green chutney, thus allowing one to augment the largely flavorless pocket with the red version instead.\n\nInvesting the rest of our appetites in bottomless curries that featured excellent basmati rice and par-for-the-course buttered Naan alongside bowls containing less than two ounces of protein each, it can only be said that at prices ranging $10-$17 the better bet is to visit one of the many local Indian buffets if one is merely looking for a 'fill up' and partaking lightly in the dirty tasting Lamb Masala as well as overly sweet Buttered Chicken a bit of credit is due to the owner for suggesting the seemingly out-of-place noodles - a show stopper of well-tuned aromatics that at least gives one hope that the kitchen could improve the rest of the recipes as time goes on.\n\nOrdering three Paan Shots that again saw the kitchen offer up something balanced and refined it was largely the lack of traditional Indian desserts that led to the final selection of Chocolate Samosas, but having experienced a similarly underwhelming dessert at Nosh & Swig just a few months prior it can only be said that this one was slightly better - the house made ice cream and melted chocolate at least helping to offset the same oily taste that had marred the papadum, though the $7.95 price tag seemed rather excessive for something so underwhelming and small.\n\nSuggested as 'urban tapas,' and thus seeming to purport a modern take on tradition, Urban Turban really only seems to shine when sticking to simpler plates and with ingredients that really seem no better than the typical Indian Buffet in an environment that does little to wow there seems very little reason to return, let alone support another restaurant import when places like Mint seem to be satisfying locals just fine."

The two dishes were Pan Fried Tandoori Pomfret (Fish) and Classic Crab Masala from Konkani region (Western India). I notified Urban Turban that we were going to dine in the restaurant on a Saturday night and my interest in the two dishes mentioned above. Within a few hours, I got a call from the owner of Urban Turban informing me that the Pomfret Fish and Crab Masala will be prepared and ready upon my arrival in the evening. I appreciate the good service and prompt communication over the telephone from UT. We received a warm welcome from UT management and acknowledgement that our dinner would be ready in a few minutes.\nPan Fried Tandoori Pomfret - This dish was making itself known as it was being brought to our table. The aroma originating from the dish was appetizing. It was prepared with spices and herbs which we were longing for. The fish had a crisp layer outside and was soft, delicate and tasty from the inside. Each bite was absolutely delicious. When I was done, nothing but the bones remained on the dish. Great job!\nClassic Crab Masala - This was the second course on our menu. It consisted of two large hard shell crabs covered with delicious curry masala complete with flavors infused right from Bombay. It was a sheer delight cracking open the crab and immersing its meat into the masala and then taking a tasteful bite. The chef did an awesome job preparing this dish. I had to ask to meet the chef and thank him for the custom prepared dishes for us.\nUrban Turban continues to manage to be versatile with its menu and therefore remains an interesting place to visit during our trips to Vegas. The already available variety on the menu coupled with custom dishes continue to make UT a shining star in Vegas."

Take your pick of restaurants, you'll get variations of cuisines and quality of experience from very good to fantastic. Buffets or ala carte, both experiences are outstanding. Now, we have ONE favorite Indian restaurant out of all of them, but Urban Turban has now moved up to number two, and may overtake number one, judging upon what we encounter during our next visit to the fave.\n\nOK. Now the details.\n\nMy spouse and I had been to Urban Turban one time before, using a Travelzoo for their tapas items. We loved the food and drinks, and wanted to return. So when a friend decided to host a party to celebrate his return visit to Vegas, he asked if we'd like to attend, and we did.\n\nWe arrived before everyone else in the party. Jose, the restaurant host who later became our waiter, asked if we'd like to wait in the bar for the rest of our party. Sure!\n\nOur bartender, forgot her name but she had just moved here from Texas, was new yet very attentive and engaging. We each got a great cocktail from her, me an Old Fashioned, my spouse a concoction containing St George gin & absinthe called Kiss of the Cobra, subtle in flavor (hard to believe) yet very strong. And Jose, out of the blue, brought to the bar, gratis, a small plate of something that resembled Indian nachos (but not as messy), and those were terrific.\n\nThe party of 8 present, we sat in the bar area at a high top for dinner. Jose was extremely knowledgeable regarding all of the food. First Jose got out of the kitchen more of those nachos we had at the bar, for everyone else to try. Then everyone ordered their food.\n\nOur party host and others present were quite generous, purchasing a few additional dishes for the table, I think mostly due to the menu being so interesting. Those passed dishes were:\n\n- Lamb Sliders: I didn't try these, as I was having lamb for dinner, but everyone who tried it liked it a lot.\n\n- Mushroom Sweet Garlic: Fried mushrooms. Yum.\n\n- Bhel: A fascinating and delicious dish. Rice puffs (like Rice Crispies) tossed with veges (particularly those tomatoes) and a tamarind sauce. I've never ordered such a thing in an Indian restaurant, and I've had lots of Indian food in the past. LOVED this dish. Our party host referred to it as \"Indian breakfast food\" to the unknowing at the table. He had had it before and loves it.\n\n- Fried Onions: I didn't catch the name, but that was basically what they were. Very good.\n\nNext came the entrees.\n\nUrban Turban has numerous entree selections, but also has a section in the menu entitled \"Bottomless Curries\". Containing 7 different dishes of chicken, lamb and vegetarian in nature, you can eat as much as you want of the main portiona, but you only get the initial naan, rice and salad with the first serving. I ordered the bottomless Bombay Lamb Masala, which was lovely and quite hot with spice. (My spouse and I can take intense heat, and sometimes request it, but this time I preferred it not be too extreme, and this was perfect.) My spouse had the bottomless Egg Curry, which is a street fave in Bombay, and very unusual. Hard boiled eggs in a sauce, it was completely different from my sauce and also lovely. Our party host was flipping out that they had the Egg Curry dish at all, he ordered it, and then he went on to say that it had the best plain rice he had ever eaten in any Indian restaurant. My spouse and I ate only one additional bowl after the first, and that was more than enough.\n\nSomeone at the table ordered bottomless Butter Chicken, which I tried, again it was completely different from any other sauces I had and was terrific. Another ordered bottomless Palak Paneer Masala, which contained spinach and those Indian cheese cubes, the dish like a Saag Paneer, and that was great. She even asked for her second bowl to be \"Indian hot\", and she was quite pleased. And another ordered the Garlic Shrimp Flatbread, and that looked great.\n\nAt the very end our party host decided to try something else unusual, so he ordered the In-House Made Ice Cream. He chose 2 flavors: betel nut and rose. The betel nut was really weird, but good. Bright green in color like basil, a slight anise flavor to it (someone said Good & Plentys but with mint), we all loved it. The rose was also outstanding. I'm not a huge rose fan, but this hit it out of the park. Both were unusual, tasting more of shaved ice from the Hawaiian places around town, but definitely Indian in style.\n\nDuring the entire meal Jose was jovial, entertaining, extremely informative, passionate, a fun and fantastic waiter.\n\nMy spouse and I will definitely be back.\n\nAnd watch out, our number one, there's a new competitor in your quality range in town!"

Our server Carlos was amazing, he recommended the dishes he liked and gave great customer service. Our food was delicious and the portions were very good. Our naan got a little too toasted/burnt which was a little sad as I always feel bad asking for things to be returned, but Carlos ended up brining us more out that was nice and soft. The place itself was very clean and the decor was really cute. Wish I lived in LV so I could visit more often."

There were five of us on attendance - it was my and my friend's second visit, my husband and best friend's first visit, and my son's third visit.  My son really likes Indian food, especially since serving overseas, and has made this his \"Go To\" Indian restaurant simply for the amazing bottomless curry dishes.\n\nOn this visit I wanted to clarify some of the negative interpretations about Indian food and table service.  Luckily, we had a fantastic American waiter named Jose.  Jose had been working here for sometime and was happy to answer my questions.  I commented that most of the Indian restaurants we checked out served all our food lukewarm.  We were told that some Indian dishes are served cold, stone cold and room temperature simply because that is the way they are made to be served, however curry soups and other main course hot dishes should be served very warm.  Second, I asked about American table service compared to Indian service in restaurants.  I commented that Indian service was greatly lacking when compared to American table service.  We were told that Indian culture usually serves the food and leaves you alone with it, and also they dishes are usually made and served one at a time rather than several dishes at a time.  Also, Indian waiters do not hover over the table, but usually wait until summoned to the table to take orders, serve food or refill drinks.  Service and attention is pretty laid back and slow, and nonchalant.  Another thing we were told is most drinks are not served iced.  So if your waiter is Indian you need to request ice.\n\nService with Jose - 5 stars\n\nWe have enjoyed the food so much, but the service sometimes was slow and erratic.  So it was nice to have an American waiter with Indian cultural knowledge he learned from the owners and other workers.\n\nFor this visit we ordered beverages of Coke and Mango Lassi.  The Mango Lassi is a fruit drink of pur\u00e9ed mango that looks like it has milk or yogurt added to it.  It's delicious.  We also ordered Buttered Chicken, Egg Curry, Bombay Fish Fry, Flavor Burst appetizer, Gun Powder Shrimp and Naan Sense.  We enjoyed everything except the Flavor Burst, which is a puff a pastry served cold with a spiced filling.  We just did not care for the flavor.  The Bombay Fish Fry was a whole fried fish - very good.  The Butter Chicken is served in a red sauce which is delicious and the chicken is so tender it melts in your mouth.   Bottomless Egg Curry was delicious.  I recommend getting your refill as just curry on the curry soup dishes and leave the meat r egg out of the extra serving, so that when you take the leftover home, it last longer in the refrigerator - because after all the curry is the best part of the dish. \n\nFood - 4 stars"

The service needs a little work, but it was more than compensated for by the owner who personally took our order after the waitress didn't know the answer to several questions. The owner was also very accommodating about making changes to his dishes and produced the first true 10 on the the hotness scale that we have found in Vegas (hotter than Lotus!). Highly recommend the restaurant."

Entering the restaurant, I felt a good medium between a casual and traditional Indian vibe, with trendy music playing in the background and a decor that wasn't over-the-top Indian. The service was incredible; I had Jose as my server, and he explained the entire menu and specialities in a way that made the place inviting and deciding food much easier. I ordered chicken tikka and garlic prawns for starters and a chicken biryani for my entree. The starters were hot and juicy (clearly fresh out the tandoor!). The garlic prawns, in particular, had an amazing tangy, sweet taste to them that I loved. The chicken biryani was on a completely different level. It stands to this day as the best biryani I've ever had. Served with a naan bread toasted over the top (dum biryani), the biryani had just the right mixture of curry and plain rice that made it irresistible. In particular, the toasted naan adds an amazing crispy taste that makes the biryani even better. Overall, good food, good service. I will be back!"

So juicy...so tender...so red...so beautiful. Other indian places ive been to have too much of a smoky flavor to their tandoori chicken but Urban Turban's was perfect. I literally cannot think of any complaints. TRY IT!\n- GOAT CURRY - 4.5/5 - im not even a big fan of goat but their goat curry was delish. Nice tender and meaty chunks floating in curry..yum. \n- GARLIC NAAN - 6/5 - comes out hot n' fresh to your table. emphasis on the HOT. and crispy. so fresh. and cripy. did I mention it was hot and crispy and fresh? GET IT! DIP IT IN ALL DA CURRIEZ.\n- FRITTERS w/ Chutneys - 4.5/5 - Not what you'd traditionally picture a fritter to be, expect more like deep fried slivers of onion, but very tasty. Please do yourself a favor and don't forget to dip the fritters in the chutneys. Salivating jus thinking about it.. ..\n- BUTTER CHICKEN - 3.5/5 - too buttery for my taste but still worth a try. \n- 'RICE' PUDDING - 4/5 - pretty sure they labeled it rice pudding BUT its basically like angel hair pasta pieces in sweet milk with raisins tossed in. sounds unappetizing and looks unappetizing but I had 3 bowls of it. nom.\n\nDONT GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT...\nSALAD- not your traditional salad...more cabbage than lettuce. I'd pass on this.\nGULAB JAMUN - mysterious brown balls floating in a syrup. usually my favorite thing to eat an indian restaurant but theirs seemed to have a stronger ginger flavor I wasn't diggin'. worth a try, but not such wow. \n\nLOCATION/PARKING - 5/5 - Same plaza as Tacos & Beer. Not too far from The Strip. Parking was easy peasy on labor day morning. \n\nSERVICE - 5/5 - Abundance of workers - every single one of them seemed genuinely friendly and attentive (usually a rarity at a cheap buffet!). Consistently checked up to see if we needed anything. \n\nOVERALL - definitely worth a visit! Even a picky eater should be able to find at least 1 thing they'd enjoy -- even vegetarians! \n\nP.S - no infamous post-indian-food-poops for me! My tastebuds were happy, my wallet was happy, my stomach and butt was happy. 5 stars!"

I have waited for 20 minutes for him to fill my glass of water, and at last I have to waive my hand to call him.\nDid not expect this kind of service from an Indian Restaurant."

I think the platter wasn't cost effective, might have cost the same to order the items separately. But all the items, aloo tikki, bhel, vada, paneer Tikka, sev puri were mouth watering. The Bombay fries were good too. It was nice that they made veggie biryani for us because the menu only had chicken biryani. Biryani was flavorful but tasted more like pulao.\nAnd we ordered masala chai to wrap it up. Very good. The chef gave us complimentary paan shots to try. They were good too, but I would have preferred it as ice cream I think :) must try restaurant for all Indian food lovers!"

There were just 2 customers in the restaurant, the waiter came and told that they have the only buffet for 14.95$, and I checked there were very few items in the buffet (not sure if it was because we went late or it is normally like that)\n\nWhen I came out and searching for other restaurants near by, one of the restaurant guys came out with the menu and told that we can order only appetizers if we wanted to, then my spouse asked if we can use restaurant.com coupon and he went inside to check with his manager. He came out and told that the order should be more than 100$ to use restaurant.com coupon even though the restaurant.com coupon says 25$ minimum. I thought who will order 100$ of appetizers for 4 people, strange and left from there to another Indian restaurant nearby.\n\nWe will never go back to this restaurant again."

It was pretty dead in there and the lights were pretty dim. I would've liked it if the table had some lighting. \nThe server came over and explained the menu. They have bottomless curries, tapas and entrees. I ordered a Mojito features cocktail,  it was pretty standard and not anything special.\nA complimentary appetizer of papadum was dropped with a green and red sauce. We ordered chicken tikka and paneer tikka.  Usually tikka has a lot of sauce, but these items just seemed dipped in the tikka sauces and the plated. The chicken tikka was really good but I found the paneer tikka very dry. We also got the daal and Himalayan curry. Both dishes were served with naan and bastmati rice. Each dish was very tasty and authentic. I did find the menu pricey, but since they have bottomless curries I guess it's worth it.  I will be back!"

Chicken tikka was freshly made, was spicy, and it was lovely! And the vegetable frankie was pretty damn nice as well! \n\nThe ambiance was cool, chic, and extremely clean and it was much much appreciated!

I took a chance and went there.  I asked the hostess if we can order from the menu for our children and she said she was not sure.  She said she will check with the chef but never got back to us. We were given a table and after few minutes we decided to go to the buffet as we were not given an answer. They have separated meat dishes and non-meat dishes into two areas.. I thought that was a good way for vegetarians.  They had the typical Indian items such as a salad, vegetable dishes, lentil dish, fritters, curry etc. Their bread (Naan ) was fresh as they run out of their pre-made Naan bread.  I enjoyed the different theme throughout the restaurant such as an Indian Auto Rickshow and framed cartoon pictures of Bombay.Overall a good place to stop during your Vegas trip if you are tired of the casino food."

Definitely recommend!\n\nThe only reason it wasn't 5 stars is that they need to develop a lunch menu with lunch pricing. 30 bucks all in for entree, appetizer and drink is good value for dinner, less so for lunch. For lunch I'd rather a smaller, more affordable portion (especially if they want to draw the business lunch crowd that is used to going to Mint etc.)"

Today, not as much. The chef talked us into getting a lamb kabob appetizer that I didn't like and never would have ordered, but felt somewhat pressured to. The samosas weren't bad but were not quite as good as at other restaurants. The butter chicken was incredibly spicy (I wasn't given a choice on the spice level) and the flavor wasn't as good as I'm used to getting. I won't say most of the food was BAD but my expectations were higher. I was also put off by the wait staff literally keeping their eyes on us the entire time. I felt as though they were watching my every bite which took some enjoyment out of the meal. The soda was flat but they kept the drinks full. We ordered paan shots post-meal since we got them before and liked them. This time they tasted like sunscreen would taste, so that was disappointing as well. The naan was huge and very good. While the service was good and the food was good/bad/meh, I wish I hadn't felt as though I was being watched and constantly asked how much I liked my food.

We lived in VA at the time and always talked about it, wanting to go back. last night on our first trip to Las Vegas in 2 years, we finally got our wish! The experience was amazing. THE OWNER HIMSELF greeted us and watched over our table. He was genuinely interested in ensuring we had a top-notch experience. I don't think I've ever met a restaurant owner personally, let alone one who was so nice!\n\nThe food was amazing, just as we remembered it. I got the Tandori Chicken and my wife got the Butter Chicken. I'm drooling now as I write this! The Naan was so fresh and tasty, I wish I could eat it every day. To finish it off, we had Paan Shots - if you've never had this tasty desert, you need to try it. Amazing! \n\nOverall, I think this is the best dining experience you'll find in Vegas. From the kind, thoughtful staff to the delectable food, I was blown away by my experience at Urban Turban."

            "review": "I love Las Vegas and places like Urban Turban are the reason why. \nThis place is located in the once famed Restaurant Row in the same strip mall location as Ruth's Chris Steakhouse Paradise Road used to be.  Now, I hate strip malls and honestly I have not had the best luck with Indian restaurants in this town but I am always willing to let somebody change my mind...Consider it changed!\n \nThe unpretentious exterior is no muss, no fuss. The owners understand my need to do a selfie and graciously accommodated me with a Turbie ( small taxi, scooter car looking thing) at the front entrance so I can jam all my friends in and get a picture.\n \nThe bar area is low key and intimate.  Two large TVs that they use to broadcast sports are above the bar.  These guys know their market and have outlets under the bar so you can charge your phone, tablet or laptop while enjoying their free wifi!  No more asking the bartender to plug your phone in beside where he is trying to make drinks ( you know you have done that!). Perfect for catching up on Facebook or doing your business emails while having lunch.\n \nThe owner, Bhushan is from Mumbai by way of Auckland, New Zealand.  He is usually there and he is really friendly.  Ask for him by name ( Bush-On or just say Bushy).  I found out that he and his wife, Jasmin have a successful Urban Turban restaurant in Auckland.  They are not new kids to the block and it shows because these dishes are authentic, made from scratch creations that have been tested and proven to be AMAZING.\n \nThe chef, yes Chef is the real deal (actually Indian) and if you have any special requests or questions he will come to your table and assist you.  For my Vegan friends, he came out prattled off several dishes that he would be happy to make Vegan for me!  Vegetarian? No problem.  Maybe you are just picky ( you know who you are).  Chef Vijay will offer substitutions and variations to accommodate whatever you need and no, you do not need to explain what gluten free means to him.  I think the thing I loved most was that he took my special requests as an enjoyable adventure and not a burden.\n \nManish and Ed are great servers that are just the right amount of friendly and knowledge that you need when eating international food with native ingredients.\nThe evening bartender, Ronaldo is a happy guy and is often singing along to the music as he polishes stemware.  Don't be afraid to make special requests; I invented my own drink and Ronaldo was more than happy to accommodate! \n \nI realize you are probably wondering about the most important part - the FOOD! \nI recommend the Tika Masala which is a spicy red curry.  Please note that you can order one portion or bottomless!  BOTTEMLESS!  It is served with a home made Naan ( Flat bread / Tortilla thing) that is so light and flakey.  It also comes with my favorite, basmati rice.  It is so fluffly I have to control myself from ordering more ( the sides are not bottomless).\nThe Palek Paneer ( green spinach curry)  is made with their own home made cheese.  It blew me away and I do not even like cheese that much.\nThe vegetable pizza on the Happy Hour menu is perfect for sharing and at $6.95 is large enough to have as your dinner.\n \nThey have a fabulous happy hour ( 3pm-6pm & 10:30pm to close) that I strongly recommend.  They also have Industry nights but I forget which day it is. I know it is posted on their website.\n \nTell them Skeedaddle sent you, spend $20 and they will give you a free glass of my favorite New Zealand wine ( Ask Bhushan).  Seriously, I do not get commission, I just love them so much. I was going on and on about this place and a friend of mine finally went.  She reported back that the service was amazing ( Thank you, Ed) and the food was so good she returned that same week!  Yeah!  Finally an Indian restaurant that is warm yet hip, friendly yet professional with quality food that will not break the bank."

This was a return visit and I highly recommend Urban Turban for anyone that might want a \"safer\" choice along the lines of the late-great Firefly (yes, they're still around - but would you eat there? I think not!). The food is awesome, this visit we shared the Bombay Chicken slider (a fave  from the prior visit, a must!), the Butter Chicken Flatbread (excellent), as well as the Spinach and Chicken Fritters (again, delish). I tried two cocktails, the Kiss of Cobra and the Marine Diver - both well worth the price - very exotic and packed a definite punch! The only problem, the service. I see another review posted for the night of 5/30, so maybe it was an off night in general but it was definitely lacking. At one point our server actually snagged the lone drink menu we asked to hang onto (did she not want us to spend more?) and we had to ask for it back. The only member of the waitstaff that was attentive was a woman who was ninja-quick in refilling our waters. Our server 'Alejandra' went completely AWOL & it took an exorbitant amount of time to get the bill (we actually had to request it) - we even noticed the hostess seemed busy flirting with another server as they both hid behind a column near the kitchen. Again, the food and drinks are very good (the atmosphere is inviting if not the most engaging, the bar area seems cozy),\n\nUPDATE: visited again on 11/11. Nearly completely empty at 7 at night, and despite that, the service was even more unattentive and slack than the previous vitist. When I sat down, I immediately grabbed the menu and attempted to order a cocktail from the drink menu on the table and was told that \"there was no bartender in today\" - which seemed odd as they'd just ended their \"happy hour\" (and by the time I left I saw someone served two beverages on a platter that came from the bar area that sure indeed looked like cocktails of some sort). Also, one of the fave items - the Butter Chicken flatbread was no longer on the menu, but oddly now in the 'kiddie section' (which was able to be ordered, but not on par with prior visits and had next to no sauce). Sorry, I really dig the food and the atmosphere and pricing is great - but I won't be back, the service is really just ridiculous and it's like no one cares. To accentuate this point, there was a large family entering when my party was leaving and while the 'host area' appears to not normally be actively staffed, no one approached them and I heard them say \"maybe this is one of those 'seat yourself type places\" - it's a miracle this place is still open."

I specifically asked for extra plates/forks because I ordered at a hotel I was staying at and they didnt give any of that. Also, I said mild for some of the plates but they were all spicy.

So here we are me and my husband waiting to be seated. There was no body at the reception, so we figured it might be like a self service thing. We took the menu cards and seated ourselves. We ordered Chinese bhel, regular bhel, 2 Frankie's (one of them was vegan as mentioned in the menu!!), ragda chat. And pav bhaji.\nWe got 4 orders of the 6. Each order took 15 minutes to come out. There is so much chaos amongst the staff. They are not one bit friendly. I think one of the servers got fired, since there was a confusion in the order and we ended up cancelling it. The owner comes to us asking us about the cancelled order and goes inside. We hear yelling and shouting about our order. Then the server storms out of the kitchen using \"f\" words. I mean who would use such words in front of customers? \nAll in all very bad customer service, even the owner isn't friendly. He had skipped an order in the bill, we corrected it, and there was no thank you for it. We are never coming back here. 1 is also too much for this place."

It's something I used a lot for transportation growing up in Mumbai! A neat touch & quite unique! \n\nThe receptionist, waiter & couple other people who checked on us were very attentive & respectful. The food was absolutely delicious, I loved the saag (spinach), eggplant Bharta & the Chana masala. They had Gulab Jamun for buffet dessert & I found them to melt in my mouth soft. The chai was nice & strong. We got to talk to the owner who is very amicable. He asked if we had tried the \"Paan shots\" & we hadn't, of course we had to. Absolutely loved it! I've never had anything like it before in my 12 years of eating Indian food all over the US.\n\nI highly recommend Urban Turban whether you live in Vegas or are visiting.

Menu is a bit muddled, with small bites taking the most space and odd fusion items (Indian pizza anyone?) featured on HH special, but the traditional items are where they shine: chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, and fish curry were all delicious, sided with an impeccable butter naan and a mountain of white rice.\n\nBottomless curies and traditional dishes are just under $20/ea, before adding in apps (average $10) and drinks (full bar). This isn't your usual takeout indian or buffet bargain, but the quality is better than many other places in town.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star after another visit. Was too focused on the flavor to care much my first visit but the portion of meat in the curries is minimal, making this place a poor value.

Think we may have been duped by false positive reviews? Please see below. \n\nIn Depth Review: Had Urban Turbin on our \"must try\" list for many months. The stars aligned and we were both able to go there on the Saturday over Memorial Day Weekend. We arrived at 7pm (prime dinner hour). We walked in and we were greeted by an enthusiastic female greeter. She asked us if we wanted to sit in the darker lounge/bar area or the dining room. Looked into the dining room and it seemed empty and very bright. Chose the more intimate bar/lounge area. The hostess seemed eager to point out the good dishes. She introduced us to the new bartender and said he would take care of us. She then contradicted herself and said she was going to take our order and would be back. The bartender took our drink order, we ordered two Bombay Mules (Moscow Mules) with Hendricks Gin. They were perfect and tasted great. \n\nSo the confusion begins... the female hostess disappeared and never came back. We sat there a long time waiting. I went up to the bar to get the bartender. He had his back to me and seemed to be struggling with the POS system. I said; can we place our order with you? He came to the table, we ordered our food. We ordered the Gun Powder Shrimp and Garlic Nan Bread as an appetizer. Then we ordered a signature chicken dish and a bottomless lamb curry dish as our entrees. We asked him to make sure we had enough time to eat our appetizer before the entrees came out. Then we go back to waiting. During the wait time, I saw that when I checked in on Yelp, I would get a complimentary glass of wine. So, I redeemed it. The wine was bitter and spoiled and there was lipstick on the side of my wine glass (not from me). The drink was free, so I did not complain. \n\nSo we are waiting, and then our entrees arrive to the table. We were shocked because the appetizers did not come out yet. Not even the bread. The food runner said the appetizers were still being made. To which I said, I would like my appetizer first, can you please make that happen? The food goes away (side note: it looked and smelled delicious). So we are waiting again. So a new food runner comes out with our Gun Powder Shrimp. The guy walks right by us and goes over to the bar to say hello and chat with three regulars. We are watching him from 15 feet away, he is talking, goes in for a hug etc. Then turns to come to our table. As he is walking over a shrimp rolls off what looks like bread. He goes \"whoops\" and proceeds to use his bare hand to pick up the shrimp and put it back. Then tries to hand it to us to eat. We were shocked, so was the bartender. At this point we have been waiting almost an hour with no food. We just asked to settle up for the drinks and said we were leaving. \n\nThe bartender was embarrassed and very apologetic. He comped or drinks, we thanked him and quickly left to go get food elsewhere as we were starving. \n\nIn Summary: Urban Turban has some obvious service issues. I suspect a lack of long-term hospitality experience with the owners and people in management positions. I also suspect that the staff might not be up to date with the rules set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District. Too bad, because it is reflecting on business. That restaurant should have been slammed at 7pm on a Saturday, over our busiest holiday weekend in Vegas. I hope that the owners read this review and make the proper changes to their business. We were so excited, but left severely let down. That should never happen."

But the food was excellent and we were treated by the staff at UT. My wife being a vegetarian, we went straight for the veggie fare and started off with samosa chat. The samosa chat was great and not like the usual super spicy fare back in India, but yet very flavorful. We were served Dahi Puri while we were waiting for the samosa chat and we attacked it like a pair of hungry vegetarian wolves.\n\nBeing tempted by the starters, we proceeded to order Paneer (cottage cheese) Tikka Masala which was served with rice and naan. I would say this is a must have non-menu item (ask for it!) for the very smooth and subtle flavor of the gravy with nice soft chunks of paneer. \n\nWe topped the gastronomic ride with masala chai and nimbu paani (lemonade) and weren't disappointed there either. Again, smooth taste but not overpowering.\n\nAll in all a very pleasant meal which i am planning to experience again before i leave vegas. Thanks!!!"

Friendly staff member greated us with a smile at the door and all the staff afterwards were just as friendly, including our server Ed. He kindly offered suggestions on a range of menu items. When we described our tastes, he was able to recommend an appetizer that fit. He also checked back on us over time, but not so much as to be intrusive. We decided on the chicken basil bites appetizer...quite tender and flavorful. Main meal, had a taste for the Chicken Tikka Masala....tender, flavorful sauce..different from sauces we've had at other Indian restuarants...Naan was tender...a little too buttery for me, but still nice. My husband had Chicken Farcha...not what we expected as it appeared to be fried in a cornmeal base..he enjoyed it as well as the side sauce. The ambiance is nice with jazz lightly playing in the background, nice lighting, sheek, yet comfortable decor. Maybe get more comfy seats per my hubbie. It was nice for date night,  but we also saw families present. The flavors were a bit different from other India restaurants we've visited, so this was nice for us. We'll visit again to try more dishes, so 4 stars for now."

The sauces they expertly make fresh, the tender meats in the dishes paired with a wonderful light rice met all those expectations we were craving. I ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala, which was just what I have been craving! My husband enjoyed the butter chicken and my son loved the Himalayan chicken! All were served with the rice and naan bread. The bottomless bowls were also a great surprise! The staff was friendly, attentive and so helpful. Our server Ed was most helpful in our decisions. \n\nThe only negative here was that a party of about 14 arrived minutes before us and that really slowed everything down.  The waiting at our table ended up being about 20 minutes.  Sometimes you can't help the unexpected.   Ed did check on us often though and kept our drinks full!\n\nWe heard about the new lunch buffet and we will be back before we go back home next week!  That says a lot as the choices in Las Vegas are infinite!  We are picky coming from Seattle where we find many great restaurants. \n\nWe met the manager here after we finished our meal and he told us about an after dinner shot that aids in digestion with mint and a spice I am unable to recall now but it worked!

I particularly enjoyed a spicy beef dish, the puff rice (great to snack on even when you're stuffed) and the tandoori chicken. \n\nPro tip: make sure you check in on Yelp to get the 10% discount and also use the buy 1 get 1 half off if you're there for lunch. Normally it's about $20 per person which I don't think is really worth it given the relatively small selection of food but with all of the discounts it'll be closer to just about $10 per person!"

Best Indian restaurant cuisine I've tasted ever. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the lack of meat variety. Only served dark meat chicken. I'm a chicken breast/wing eater and I don't care for the texture of dark meat foul. My friend had the curry chicken and I ate some sauce with the rice and wow! It was perfection on a plate.  The samosas were unbelievably great. Apparently the traditional way a serving is with a tamarind/chick pea sauce. I could not stop eating the chick pea sauce. The samosas were tasty fried puffs of heaven alone, but once paired with the sauce, Flavor Station!! Never in life had I eaten chick peas. All at once I'm in love. Great restaurant. Check it out."

This time though I tried their buffet and this is by far the best buffet in Las Vegas. \n\nHaving lived in vegas for about a year and tried every buffet in town.. I almost overlooked this one assuming it would be the same bland taste... how wrong was I... highlight was the chicken curry and the garlic naan..."

Urban Turban has been my third restaurant and the Bhel Puri here is so much better than the other two that I decided I must let the world know about it. I am Indian and a foodie, as well as a gourmet cook and I can say that the Bhel at UT is just great. Firstly the portion is huge for the price - a complete meal by itself and simply delicious and authentic. It needed to be a little spicier, so I requested them to chop some green chillies for me to garnish the Bhel with. The service was as cheerful as the ambiance with the autorikshaw. Before the Bhel came an ample serving of papad with VEGAN mint chutney which was a pleasant surprise to a dairy allergic person like me. The African American waiter gave me a high five saying he was dairy allergic too and was pleased that he could cater to my needs. All in all, UT matched my preference for a fun place with good and tasty food served with panache. I look forward to another visit soon when I intend to try out the vada pav or anything else vegan on the menu."

Urban Turban's Gunpowder Shrimp, Naan Sense (lol love the pun) and Chicken 65 to start it off hit the spot for us. Delicious! Their bottomless Butter Chicken was amazing. The Raita wonderfully complemented the curry and naan. Loved the meal so much that we ordered further side of naans. The wait staff was quite attentive and helpful. Came over to make sure we were enjoying our meal a couple of times. We finished off with chocolate samosas (awesome!) and the paan shots. The paan shots are a must try! We ended the dinner with their Masala Tea which was seriously authentic! The art and decor of the place was clever and really nice. Took a few photos with the Auto Rickshaw called Turbie before we left. It was easily the best dinner we had in Vegas. 5 stars....Highly recommended!"

The only problem I would say is that the food is a bit pricey for the quality. I ordered the Butter Chicken bottomless curry bowl (which was around 17$) and felt that it was watered down. I feel if you don't plan on eating enormous amounts of curry, it would be better to spend the 17$ at Mint or India Masala to get higher quality curry. But if you can down 3 or 4 bowls of curry, then it would be definitely worth it to get the bottomless curry here."

When I shared my new obsession with my Indian friend Mohammad, he told me, \" Very good my friend, I'll take you to a really good Indian restaurant\" and we went to Urban Turban on Paradise Rd in Las Vegas. The place is close to the strip, but the prices are very normal and way lower than the highly overpriced strip restaurants. The place has a separate urban bar area that is cozy and offers all kind of drinks. We had a very friendly bartender girl. She explained it was her first day at the job, but she had great personality and did really well serving and entertaining my friend and me.\n\nThe food was amazingly delicious as Mohammad had promised me. I ordered the lamb kebabs that came individually cut and stuck on a little shish topped in a shot glass with tasty sauce. The lamb was so delicious that I immediately repeated my order. We also had chicken tandoori and a number of vegetables dishes like Pav Bhaji and rice that tasted very well. \n\nUrban Turban also has an Indian Buffet during the day. They told me it is really inexpensive, something like $9.95 per person. I have to visit it soon."
