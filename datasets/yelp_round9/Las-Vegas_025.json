            "review": "Came for a business dinner tonight, so a good way to check out the place.  I was used to seeing this place on Flamingo and Jones for years, and was sad we never made it in before it closed.  But I get this memo with an invite for dinner and was surprised to learn they had just moved locations.  I have to admit, it's smart, now closer to the strip and more business!\n\nSince it was  business dinner, I didn't get the entire menu to choose from but did get to choose from a smaller version.  They started off with an antipasta tray, it had Italian cold cuts, cheeses, marinated vegetables, it was great.  \n\nThen they gave use a house salad, mixed greens,with house vinaigrette.  And finally we had our choice of three entrees, 8 oz Prime filet mignon topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms, onions served with starch & vegetable of the day, Grilled organic raised salmon with fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh garlic & Kalamata olives served with starch & vegetable of the day, or Half free-range boneless chicken, extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, served with starch & vegetable of the day.  I chose the filet, it was perfect.  Tender, cooked just right, very good meal.\n\nOur desert was a creamy cheesecake topped with fresh raspberries in a raspberry coulis.  It was a perfect meal, cooked perfectly, service was excellent and it was free, oh, I did have to listen to the presentation but it was worth it!"

The shank was enormous like a Flinstone meal and it looked really good. It was good but that was it just good. I expected to get knocked off my feet. Maybe I just set the standard so high before even setting foot in this restaurant. A bit biased on my part. The service was good. I may have to try this place again and see."

            "review": "So many glowing reviews and I was just disappointed. \n\nI took my husband here for his birthday dinner. It was between this and his favorite Italian restaurant,  Rao's. I figured I'd take him for something new and exciting. First, I was upset that I had made a reservation specifying that it was a special occasion,  my husband's birthday, and the greeters did not pick up on this or mention it. I was also disappointed to see that they stopped offering the locals' discount as of the New Year. \n\nNext, we were seated without menus and sat for 5 minutes without them. The waiter was not cheerful or pleasant. \n\nI was hoping for a cheese ravioli but the only options included lobster or meat.  I wound up with the gnocchi, which was actually very good. It tasted authentic and homemade. \n\nDessert rolled around. I had hopes that there would be some nice birthday presentation but, no, they missed the mark completely.  \n\nThe bathroom was beautiful and spotless but I'll just say this: I hate bathroom attendants. That is all. \n\nThe off the strip location was nice. I liked not having to walk through a casino. But this is one instance where I would rather have gone to the strip. No more locals discount and couldn't even go slightly out of the way to make my husband's birthday a little special? You had potential, Ferraro's, but I'm not a happy customer."

Truly authentic Italian food, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. We loved the homemade italian sausage, homemade ravioli and osso bucco to name a few. The service is some of the best we've ever had and the owner is very friendly."

Funny story, a group of us walked in here for the HH, and since we chose to stick to the HH items only, we didn't get our pasta. We got a ton of other stuff though! :)\n\nCalamari-  4/5 stars. I prefer light breaded calamari's Italian-style, so they had the exact breading I was hoping for. However, it started to fall off the calamari so quickly. :/\n\nMeatballs and polenta cake- 5/5. These meatballs were amazing, and the sauce was very good. \n\nBianca pizza- 3/5. Not too shabby, but crust was decent. \n\nBucatini bolognese- 3/5 stars. The portion is tiny. I wasn't really digging' the pasta that reminded me of worms. \n\nArancini (fried rice balls with truffle oil) - 3/5 stars. It was alright. \n\nNice ambiance, and great place for a date night. I may come back and try their pasta dishes on their regular menu, but that may not e for a while."

We started with the Tritata Salad, I loved the flavor dimensions of the salad and you can never go wrong with crispy pancetta!  \nWe also had 2 Pasta dishes, both better than the other.  Porcini Pappardelle con Ragu di Cinghiale (pasta with boar meat sauce).  This was so wonderful.  A truly hearty and filling dish with so much flavor.  Our 2nd, Bucatini Carbonara e Tartufio Nero.  All I can say is this was the best Carbonara I have ever had!  This is a place I would love to go to again and again.  \nService was very good.  Server, Paulo was very knowledge and efficient."

            "review": "I have eaten at this restaurant about a dozen times and always been impressed by their food (but sadly, neglected to review it during the good times).  Fortunately, at the time, my companions made it a point to post positive reviews of the restaurant.  So, when I had relatives visiting from out of town, looking for a late night meal, I proudly recommended Ferraro's. \n\nThe restaurant could not possibly have made me look worse than with the sad events earlier tonight.  The back patio - normally quiet and sane - was booked for a private party and it was loud and rocking.  No problem by itself, but I wonder if it left the dining room understaffed.\n\nNot to belabor the details, but the meals we were served would have been terrible by Olive Garden standards.  Each of our three entrees were served cold (you'd have to heat them a few degrees to get to lukewarm) and were mostly inedible.  The fact that all three of us left 80% of our meals untouched was clearly lost on the busboy who was surprised that none of us requested a doggy bag.  After waiting 45 minutes for our food to arrive, none of us was in the mood to even consider a re-order even if it had been offered - which (it's important to note) it was NOT.  Our waitress simply dropped off our check and rushed off to the next table.\n\nI don't know if any of this was because the kitchen was overwhelmed, or if the one lone waitress in the dining room didn't bring them out quickly enough - and quite frankly I don't care.\n\nIt may have been just another day on their schedule and - oops - they messed up during a pre-booked party, but it was a very important event in my life and that meal was simply unacceptable.  \n\nCertainly by my previous experiences, and by the reviews of others on this page, your odds favor a good experience.  But I like to leave my gambling at the tables and - now that this restaurant is clearly not a sure thing - take my business elsewhere.\n\nOh, yes... shame on you, Ferraro's.  When you stop caring about one customer, how long before you stop caring about them all?  Keep offering 1/2 off deals for locals and then treating us like crap. It's a guaranteed long-term recipe for failure."

            "review": "If I had to pick a late night dinner joint out of any place in Vegas, this would probably be my star choice!\n\nFirst of all, before moving to Vegas, I had never heard of reverse Happy Hours.  Are you kidding me?  HH at 2 am?  Good lord, I LOVE VEGAS!  Also, a bonus is that everything on the late night menu is 50% off!  Whaaaat?!\n\nTheir Italian dishes are the real deal.  Authentic, large servings and 100% pure delizioso!  My favorite being their Caprese di Bufala..  The Mozzarella is incredible!\n\nOnto the pastas and Risotto.. Oy Vey!  So good!  Growing up in an Italian household, I know my Risotto.  I'm never fully happy with ordering risotto in a restaurant, but I always make an exception for Ferraro's.  The consistency is perfect, the rice is always al dente and they have a plethora of risotto dishes to choose from. As far as pasta goes, I love to keep it real and stick with Spaghetti but their stuffed ravioli Agnolotti dish would have to be my favorite.  So good! \n\nLastly, the service is great!   The servers know Italian food and have personally tasted every item on the menu..  About 90% of the servers are from Italy, so the accents are always a plus to the dining experience.  They know it all and you have to respect that.\n\nAll in all, great environment, fun crowds, perfect service and delicious food!  \n\nFerraro's is right off the strip, so it's just a short cab ride away..  And, if you're a local trying to show your out-of-town friends a nice late night meal, go here!"

            "review": "When my friend and I were visiting Vegas the advice we received from every local was to eat off the strip because that's where the best food is. So since Ferraro's is off the strip we found it on yelp and decided to give it a try. We made reservations for 7pm. We arrived right on time and they did not have a table ready unless we wanted to sit outside, it was February and still quite chilly so we said we would wait. We finally got seated about fifteen minutes later.\n\nThey have a huge wine list, over hundreds of wines to choose from. The food menu is quite large as well. The service was just so, so. I don't know if we received poor service because we were younger compared to the crowed or because we were seated towards the back of the room but it wasn't good. We ordered an appetizer and it came out within minutes. Our entrees came out about three minutes later. We were then trying to juggle about five plates on a small table for two. I hate when restaurants rush the service. At the end of our meals were not even asked if we wanted dessert so we skipped out. \n\nOverall, the food was good. The service was bad and we were rushed. Not the great experience we were looking for."

The space is nice and intimate and the service is wonderful. Fabulous staff.\n\nDuring the previous summer, Ruben and I dined with one of our best friends, Randy. We were delighted to discover that they were offering locals 50% off the bill! Whoa right? So we took full advantage of it and did a full Italian dinner! ANTIPASTI: Calamari Fritti and Salsiccia Calabrese e Rapini (housemade spicy sausage grilled with polenta triangles). PASTA sampler course: Gnocchi with Boar Ragu, Lobster Truffle Ravioli, and Agnolotti (ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce). I SECONDI: Osso Bucco, Fettuccine Pomodoro Con Ricotta Fresca, and Agnolotti (Ruben liked it so much, he ordered it for his entr\u00e9e!). DESSERT: Pistachio Passion (layered pistachio cream, cream cheese custard & whipped cream atop a rich walnut crust) and Tiramisu. Everything was phenomenal. We all ordered drinks as well and the bill was around $150. Amazing.\n\nToday, we visited for lunch and had to get the Calamari Fritti again. Very nice. Light breading, large, fresh prices of calamari, and delicious, spicy marinara. It definitely outshined the Calamari we had just two days ago! I opted for the Spaghetti Vongole e Pomodorini (housemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic & cherry tomatoes) and Ruben had the Penne Pesto e Pollo (penne with a light basil sauce topped with chicken breast). Both were really wonderful and the pasta was seriously good (also, cooked perfectly al dente)! I also don't remember the bread tasting so good last time! They were little baguettes with an oil dipping sauce and I couldn't get enough.\n\nGreat Italian food, decent prices, and wonderful experiences. Yes!"

            "review": "After my meal at Ferraro's, I found that it could be viewed in one of two ways...as a local or as a visitor/tourist.\n\nAs a local I could go as high as a 4/5, but as a tourist it could be as low as a 2/5, so I split the difference.  The main reason is price.  Before going to Ferraro's I checked out the menu online and thought, \"man this places must be fancy, maybe this is an off-strip gem\" (since it was suggested by a long-time Vegas resisdent, myself being new to the area).  The decor was nice, staff friendly, the bar wasn't bad either.  For me there is always that bit of hesitation when all the starters, salads, soups on the menu are $10-$20 because it tends to cause expectations to go up.\n\nI will say the apps were pretty good.  My brother-in-law got a pizza which looked like nothing special but he did clean his plate.  I went with the sausage and peppers which was definitely good, but not a $14 app.  I mean sausage and peppers should be about as cheap as it comes.  My wife went with the Chef Mimmo salad which was also good.  The avocado was very fresh as is common in this parts and the balsamic and mozzarella was good as well.  It was a different take on the salad because all the ingredients were served as cubes or chunks and tossed together.\n\nFor my entree I went with the Filet.  It was probably below average.  Cooked right but very plain, not a lot of flavor at all, not a $41 filet. The veggies were standard, nothing special there.  However, the mashed potatoes were clearly of the instant variety.  The only reason I took a second bite was to confirm the first was actually that bad.  My wife went with the porcini rubbed rib-eye.  This was much better than the filet but still not a $48 entree.\n\nNow for the savings grace...locals get 50% OFF with a local ID.  I didn't scour the bill in detail since the wife took care of it, but I'm not sure if the discount applied to all food or just entrees.  Either way, this made the meal much more tolerable.  I went from thinking her meal at $48 was wildy over priced and thinking I'd much rather pay an extra $10-$20 at a high end place on the strip, to thinking, this isn't a bad meal for $24.\n\nIf I were to go back, I would probably try out some seafood or pasta options versus the beef, but at 50% I can say that I could see myself going back.  However, if you are a tourist staying across the street at the Hard Rock and looking for other options, I might try to look elsewhere for some better value."

            "review": "First off, I would like to say that the negative reviews on here are absolutely absurd. I am a frequent flier to Las Vegas and my father-in-law suggested this lovely Italian restaurant that he's been frequenting for over thirty years. \n\nThe food is exquisite! Hands down one of the top meals I have had in my life. My husband always orders the Osso Buco which doesn't require the knife they provide, as it falls right off the bone. The best part is the tiny fork that given so the marrow can be eaten. It's cooked perfectly and is heavenly on the palate.\n\nAny of the Risotto dishes are classically prepared, rich and creamy and full of flavor. The lobster ravioli is heavenly and light. Like little pockets of clouds bursts with bold flavor.\n\nMost importantly, I cannot forget to mention Mr. Geno, the owner of this fine establishment. He is truly passionate about his restaurant and his customers. He is a genuinely nice guy and actually sits with his customers just to see how they are doing and to ask if your meals were to your liking. At our last visit in May 2015, We had an amazing waiter Joquain, who was always there for any of our needs and provided unparalleled service. This place really makes you feel like an extended part of the family and being married into an Italian family, I recognize the importance of that."

Absolutely delicious Italian (REAL ITALIAN) and this positive endorsement comes from a New Yorker who knows of great Italian Food. \n\nYes the place is in a strip mall but DO NOT let that deter you. We didn't dine off the menu instead we had the chef prepare us a 4 course meal based on our discussion of food when he came to say hi at the table. I immediately said that I was in the mood for pasta, love risotto, love arugula, proscuitto, cheese and that I am an eater... little girl with a love for food. \n\nFirst course was a sampler of risotto (best in my life ever) agnolotti pasta AMAZING, and a pesto risotto OMG incredible. \n\nSecond Course: arugula salad with sliced proscuitto and buffalla mozzerella that was a ball of heaven. Perfectly dressed with a hint of lemon. Incredible!! \n\nThird Course: Oso Bucco which is what the restaurant is famous for. Literally falls off the bone and I'm not a huge fan of Osso Bucco but if you are don't leave this place without having some. It's cooked superbly. Chef also brought us linguini di mare with mussels, scallops, shrimp, octopus. Delicious.

There are so many great restaurants all within a half-mile radius of Ferraro's and and  the restaurant definitely stood out exuding its over 25 years of charming, old-world elegant presence. \n\nThe interior decor is classical Italian. A bar is located to the left upon entering the restaurant. People can order drinks while waiting. Plenty of great seating on the outer patio offering nice ambiance and the area is particularly wonderful on a cool evening under the heated lamps and round fire pits.\n\nAll of the dishes served were very well-prepared with great depth of flavor. The caprese and the osso buco were espcially excellent. Dessert was most decadent and delightful.\n\n- Appetizer trio:  ravioli, crab cake and seared scallop\n- Caprese di Bufala - heirloom tamatoes, buffalo mozzarella, pine nuts\n- Osso buco - Braised veal shank with farro grain\n- Filetto di Manzo - 8oz prime filet mignon topped with mushrooms\n- Dessert - cannoli and tiramisu\n\nService was excellent. Valet parking available. Will definitely return to sample other dishes on their menu."

Oh yes and the wonderful anti pasta and fresh mozzarella. Dessert was on the house,with tiramisu,cannoli and gelato. Our waiter Alessandro was awesome, he made feel so welcome he even gave us a tour of the kitchen,it was immaculate. Looking forward to returning and trying some other great food."

Went here on the recommendation of the Concierge in the hotel, and got a GLOWING seal of approval by the bit boss Maria who is 100% Italian and said if she and her husband go for Italian they go here or she cooks it at home!  We met some very nice folks at the bar while waiting a very short time for our table.  They spend a quite a bit of time in Vegas and are regulars.  We had one of the BEST waiters we have ever experienced, Gianni!  It was like eating dinner with family and friends.  We had a meatball/sausage appetizer - awesome!  My husband had the Osso Bucco and if he could have licked the plate he would have.  I had chicken piccata and it was outstanding.  The sommelier (sorry can't remember his name) helped us pick out a great bottle of Borolo that rounded out our meal very well.  I had to use the restroom during dinner and this very nice man escorted me through the restaurant and it turned out to be Gino the owner.   We also had the opportunity to meet another waiter Joaquin who was also extremely helpful and gave us some great tips for things to do.  Definitely a team approach to making sure the customers are served with expertise!!  We topped off the night with a dessert sampler that was again, awesome!  As Boston folks we we accustomed to excellent Italian desserts, the canoli and tirami su were excellent!  We won't take a trip to Vegas without going back!  I also took a look around the restaurant - and they have many private rooms for groups as well."

The only minor issue would be the lack of air conditioning the room got.  No matter how many times our server would pump it up, the lack of cool air was very clear.  Made it very difficult to keep people focused on the meeting.  Overall a good meal and worth a more casual visit the next time."

We were seated in a round booth, perfectly situated for side-by-side people watching. Oh Vegas, you never cease to amaze slash repulse slash delight.\n\nOur waiter was helpful and perfectly timed, not pushing, not making us wait. I had the Ruby Slipper (or a pair of them) to drink and let me tell you: that thing goes down smooth. I didn't even realize I was boozing until I was drunk. WOOPS. The bread and oil opener was delicious, though I would have liked a little more of the herb to balance the oil. We had a house salad to share as a starter and that was fabulous too, but small.\n\nMy date ordered the Half-chicken and said it was delicious; I had the filet because I am an asshole and a very expensive date. The filet was very nicely done; perfectly cooked and juicy with some of the balsamic glaze on the plate with mushrooms and peppers. I could eat that steak over and over. The vegetables were also delicious, but the potatoes were a little underwhelming. A different starch could be better.\n\nI would definitely come back."

I got the special they have for $50 which included your choice of pasta,  excellent, your choice of salad, I got the Cesar salad which was equally tasty, and the medium-well filet mignon, which was.....okay. The special also came with a dessert sampler of a cannoli and tiramisu which were delicious! Overall, the service was alright and did not have the best timing, I mean really, 20 minutes for our drinks? Most servers make conversation with guests but she did not conversate with us. Ferraros was good, but I would not dine here again, us being locals."

When our bill was presented she took the cert and when it was returned to us their was a 3.00 difference same with the locals promotion. She also had charged us for the most expensive glass of wine when we had the less expensive wine. We purchased two glasses at the bar at one price and were charged more at the table for the second glasses. This is the third time we have been treated this way by the same server. If they are going to offer specials they should honor them. We have dined and spent a lot there without discounts there was no reason to do this. We will not be back. Also the 18% gratuity that she added on the second bill was not necessary my daughter works in the industry so we always tip 20 to 25% so she lost out, wrong person to do this to. Never again"

Are you situated in a random plaza across from the Hard Rock so that you risk appearing fairly nondescript? YES! When patrons walk through your doors, would they be surprised at the classy decor, the Chihuly-esque chandeliers, and the soft music piped through the entire venue? YES! Are your waiters helpful in assisting indecisive patrons (like moi) make appropriate choices? YES! Do your menu choices evoke the praise they deserve? YES! (Their Spaghettini Scolio (seafood pasta) is fabulous..... so good, in fact, that even though I packed half of it, I decided to eat more when I got home because I was craving it after the drive back home! OINK!) Are your menu choices ridiculously expensive? YES (if you consider said Spaghettini was $36!! Admittedly, the portion could easily have served 2 -- but $36 for pasta is still pricey... even if it does come with a couple of jumbo prawns.) Is anyone surprised at your loyal following? NO! At the end of the day, you are in a class by yourself. You are a family-owned institution in Vegas with fabulous fare served by smiling waiters and there should be more like you for locals to support."

Everything from service to food to ambiance is excellent.\n\nCame here for dinner two nights ago and got seated immediately in the bar area. Considering it was a Friday night, I didn't expect to get seated so quickly. The waiter quickly let us know that if we were locals, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on the menu was 50% off. \n\nCarpaccio Torcello: Amazing! All the flavors melded so well together. The argula added a nice peppery bite, while the parmigiano added just enough saltiness to accentuate the beef...and the truffle oil....well, truffle oil just makes everything better!\n\nCarpaccio di Tonno: Again, this was amazing! None of the ingredients in this dish over powered the other. They seem to only bring out the beautiful flavors in each other. A must try if you love ahi tuna.\n\nFunghi Misti al Forno: Delicious! I'm not sure how the pizzas are cooked, but by the looks and taste of it, I would think it was brick oven baked. The edges were crispy, the mozzarella was perfectly melted and the mushrooms (not sure what kind of mushrooms they were) but they still had a nice bite to them (kind of like enoki mushrooms). PERFECTION!\n\nFettuccine Pomodoro: Fettucine with Fresh Tomato, Basil, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil topped with Fresh Ricotta. The noodles tastes as if they were made fresh. This dish has no meat whatsoever, but you definitely do not miss the meat with all the great ingredients and flavors going on in this dish. The ricotta was a great addition as it added a silky creaminess to the dish without being too heavy. Again, to me, this was PERFECTION!\n\nPinot Grigio - Veneto, Italy, '09 - Slightly sweet and the perfect pairing to the pizza and pasta\n\nPinot Noir - (not sure of the location or year) - delicious, warm aromatics and was a perfect pairing to the carpaccios.\n\nRuby Slipper Martini - delicious! There's definitely alcohol in this! Even though it tastes like fruit punch, it definitely creeped up on us a little later.\n\nThe service was great! The wait staff was very professional and were very attentive. I will definitely be returning!"

Waiter came to our table within one minute of us being seated his name was Michael and he was a wonderful waiter.\nThe five of us each tried a different dish and everybody was extremely satisfied. From the spaghetti Bolognese to the meatballs to the rack of lamb to the Nonna's stuffed peppers everything was wonderful. Never had to look for the busboy to get my water refilled he was attentive without being obtrusive. I highly recommend this wonderful dining experience to anyone who truly loves excellent Italian food.

The pasta is made fresh there and the seafood is flown in everyday. They also have a wonderful wine cellar and extensive wine menu! They have live music (great vocalist/musician) which can also be heard outside via speaker system. The prices are moderate to expensive but worth the visit, especially for any special occasion. **One word of caution if sitting outside! The restaurant is just north of the airport and if their using the North/South runway it can get noisy. This isn't their fault so I'm still giving Ferraro's a much deserved excellent rating!**"

The evening started off okay as we told our server we were1st timers. She asked if we were locals and I replied yes and she informed us of the locals discount. Since we had not been there before we allowed our server to prepare a starter plate for us which was wonderful and very filling. Once she returned to our table we informed her the starter plate was perfect and had actually filled us up so we asked to cancel one entree and asked if we could split the other. She agreed but that's when things turned sour. No longer did she visit our table to chat, we had to catch her on the run to ask another question. We were never offered refills on beverages including the glass of wine I had finished after the appetizer. And once our meal came out it was brought by a different server. I understand pasta being served al dente but this was actually chewy. We didn't see our server again until it was time for the check. She mentioned she would have it to us shortly as another server was applying our discount. \nAfter waiting another 10 minutes the check was presented.  Definitely over priced for what we received, a starter plate, one entree and a glass of wine & the total was $102+.  We still tipped 20% and headed out the door. Imagine our surprise when my friend looked at the receipt later & noticed that there was an automatic gratuity for 18% that was added to the check!!\nBeing in the restaurant business that is normally reserved for a larger party than the party of 2 we were and it is pointed out and circled on the check, neither of which was the case for us. After reading other reviews it seems that this is a normal practice for the staff of this establishment.\n I'm only left to wonder that maybe since we were dressed rather casually, of ethnic descent and asked to split one entree if the server thought we were not going to tip appropriately.  Instead of being able to recommend Ferraro's I will do the opposite."

GO! \n\nPros:\n- Perfect for a date, no matter what age\n- Fancy pants enough to have a bathroom attendant?!\n- Clean!\n\nCons:\n- Erm, like none? \n\nService - 5/5. Staff was beyond wonderful. Just genuine, warm vibes through and through. People here to treat you with kindness because they're just good people, not ONLY because they're here to make some money. (Which is a great way to earn even more of my money, too.)\n\nHappy Hour Food- \n- Wine is 25% off! \n- House bread- 5/5 Ohhhhhhh you need this. One of the best I've ever had.\n- Beet salad- 5/5 Fabulous flavors! \n- Calamari- 3/5 pretty generic. Comes with a sweeter sauce.\n- Caesar salad- 4/5 pretty plating. Whole leaf served\n- Pizza with prosciutto (forgot the name!)- 5/5 super delicious.\n- Meatballs with polenta- 4/5\n\nSo in summary... I don't have much to say about the HH except that all of the bites were wonderful. Come here with some friends, and look forward to a good night."

She suggested the Argiano, which was superb! Next, our waiter, Eric was amazing! Best service I have had in a long time! I had the Mimmo salad and my husband had the chicken parmesan. The food here is absolutely decadent.  To top it off our excellent waiter heard us discussing that we were celebrating my husband's 54th birthday and brought us a complimentary tiramisu. It was creamy and delicious. I will definitely eat here every time I come to Las Vegas!"

Totally exceeded all of our expectations.  We wanted to sit outside next to the fire pit, so we had to wait a while in the bar - the bartenter was so helpful, and they had some very nice wines on tap, including a lovely Montepulciano.\n\nThen we moved outside for dinner, and they continued to exceed our expectations!  We couldn't decide on a dish, so we went with a variety of the Italian \"tapas\" (probably 40 choices in all).  Had a wonderful arrancini with truffle cream sauce (so rich!), wonderful polpetti di nona, some very nice grilled vegetables with goat cheese, fritto misto (excellent and not at all greasy), and a grilled sausage (probably the low point in the meal).  Everything was wonderfully prepared and plated - not at all your typical American/Italian generic slop, and not what you expect from Vegas or a strip mall, but who'se complaining?\n\nWe'll defnitely go back, and so should you if you're in Vegas, baby!"

We began with drinks that were not watered down. My Jack & Coke was mostly Jack with a splash of Coke. My wife's Snickerdoodle (pinky drink) tasted like the real thing. It should've been a dessert drink.\n\nThe bread basket was warm and we began with an appitizer sampler: 1) lobster ravioli with asparagus was my favorite thing I ate here. Luckily, the Mrs. doesn't eat seafood so I got hers, too. 2) Mushroom risoto was cooked al dente. Very good. 3) Sausage had spice. Very good. Then I got the scallop appetizer. It was perfectly seared and seasoned. I could've ended the meal there, but my main dish was brought out: Osso Bucco (The house specialty) $43.\n\nI was a bit disappointed here. The meat was fall off the bone tender and beefy. It was the tomato based sauce that just didn't seem to go well with the meat. I like my braised meats with garlic & rosemary, so I ate the rosemary garnish with it. I did eat the bone marrow on the bread. That was extremely rich. The barley side was kinda bland, but a plenty. I tried my wife's filet. It was kinda tough and dry. Nothing special.\n\nThe tiramisu was perfection, but it was way too small. I make mine from scratch, so I'm used to giving myself bigger slices. This was about half the size of a deck of cards. I recently read that the owner comes in everyday and personally makes the Tiramisu though. \n\nLimoncello was STRONG. I could only take a few sips and gave it to others who could handle it.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy it because it was FREE!"

Ambiance was perfect for being able to talk in peace with just the right amount of background noise.

There's those times when the only thing that can satisfy you is the taste of a home-cooked meal. When that craving hits, head to Ferraro's Italian Restaurant and Wine Bar, conveniently located across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. \n\nA family-owned Las Vegas institution since 1985, Ferraro's features elegant yet hearty Italian fare. Owned by native Calabrian, Gino Ferraro, and run by his family and Tuscan-trained son, Mimmo, Ferraro's has a taste of Italy you can't get find anywhere else in Las Vegas.\n\nAlong with an extensive wine cellar, and Safe Harbor Certified seafood, Ferraro's boasts of house-made, fresh pasta, along with house-made bread and desserts. Also available are whole-wheat and gluten-free pasta.\n\nWith a lunch menu that features Salmon Pesto and Chicken Marinara for less than $10, as well as an assortment of salads, pizzas and Panini for less than $15 - their lunch specials are some of the best you can get for the money.\n\nFerraro's features two distinct happy hours - one at 4-7 p.m. which features a special menu and 25% off drinks. Ferraro's Late Night features 50% off the regular dinner menu from 11 p.m. - 2 a.m. For less than a show ticket, a late night feast for two, featuring an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and drinks awaits. The deal is incredible. \n\nHighly suggested are the incredible Nonna's Stuffed Peppers, which are easily a meal in themselves, and the house-made Gnocchi Bolognese. If you're looking for something light, split the Affettati e Formaggi appetizer - a plate of selected imported Italian cold-cuts and cheeses. It goes great with champagne and the complementary house bread."

The steak was cooked to perfection and the side of rustic potatoes were crispy thru the end. \n\nI tried her sea bass, and I can honestly say that it was the best fish dish I've had in my life. The fish had salty roasted peppers on the side and it perfectly complimented the delicate fish. It was literally melting in my mouth. My steak was perfect, but I could not stop eating her Chilean Sea bass. \n\nThe service was one of the best I have ever experienced. I am not just saying this because the food so good it blinded me. The service was really top notch.\n\nOur waiter, the older bald gentleman, sorry I can't remember his name. Was really attentive and genuine with his speech. He wasn't over bearing or overly friendly to the point where it annoying. Straight to the point and very prompt with everything. \n\nI been to  masteros and it is one of the most pretentious places on the planet. I am pretty sure masteros gave my gf a usda choice cut of steak and charged us for prime because they thought we are young and wouldn't notice the difference. I have a feeling a lot of high end restaurants do this. They have cheaper cuts on the side for suckers that they think won't notice the difference.  \n\n\nAnyway, forget all other restaurants, I will recommend all my friends to Ferraaro's.

From the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave it is absolute perfection.  \n\nThis was my first time going to this place, as I live in LA and was in town for a few hours for a business dinner.  My clients suggested this place as they have been frequenting the business for over a decade.\n\nAs you walk in, you will see the many awards and accolades that this place has received on the wall to your right.  (The stretch from basically the floor to the ceiling lol) and the place is just warm.  on the opposite side is a family portrait (as this is a family owed restaurant.)  \n\nAs you walk to the host stand I was greeted by everyone from the host to the servers which was very inviting.  My clients had not shown up yet so i sat in the lobby and waited till they showed.  \n\nOnce we were seated the waiter was amazing.  Had an accent but explained everything very well and suggested one of the 3 specials for the night.  I cannot pronounce or even remember the name for that matter of the dish however it was 8oz of lobster, w mushrooms, homemade fettucini with a white wine butter/garlic sauce..BEYOND WORDS.  Was heaven in my mouth.\n\nDuring dinner Mimmo Ferraro came to the table (the son of Mr. Gino Ferraro) who was the Exec Chef? to check on everything.  Was a very nice touch of class. And then about 20 mins later Gino came to the table as well.  I love the personal touch of the service from the owners.  Tells alot about a business.\n\nI did not order desert, however next time i probably will.  This place is definitely on the higher end price wise but worth every single penny.\n\nGentlemen if you are looking for a place to take your date, this would be a great place.  We had a pretty great dinner meeting, not to loud, great ambiance just overall this place gets a 10!!!\n\nThis is my new spot in Vegas for dinner.  Cannot wait to come back.  \n\nThank you Ferraro's for a delightful dinner experience."

Sure, the flashy ones on the Strip with all the big name chefs are good, but this is a local place with a fabulous selection of wine and fantastic Italian food.  It's just like being in Italy.  So, if you are looking for a great meal, fantastic wine selection and reasonable prices, come off the Strip and visit!"

Enjoyed her.\nStarted with the Calamari which was ridiculously good, and a perfect sized portion.  The house salad that came next was a bit large, but nevertheless was good.  I had a tough time choosing between the Salmon and the Chicken and after talking with Nina, settled on the Salmon.  Definitely made the right choice.  Perfect portion, cooked perfect.  Flavor of the accompanying items were amazing.\nI also had a Sangria, which always makes me happy.  Definitely recommend this place!"

Food is excellent, well prepared from fresh ingredients.  I noticed that the quality of waiter service depends on how expensive a wine ordered or # of cocktails.  Otherwise you sit & wait and hard to get waiters attention.  Food runners auction the food delivery like Olive Garden instead of the waiter telling them what each person ordered.  I would suggest avoiding on weekends and try it during a week day."

I saw customers walk in dressed in everything from Mickey Mouse sweatshirts and denim shorts to cocktail party attire.\n\nFerraro's is almost dead around 5:30PM on a Saturday but that doesn't mean the service is any faster. In fact, the service was outrageously slow.\n\nI'm not one of those people who walks into a restaurant like Ferraro's and expects to be in and out in 30 minutes, but I would've liked for my visit to be under 2 hours considering it was just my husband and me and 75% of our time here was spent searching and waiting for our server.\n\nIt took at least 15 minutes just to get menus even though when we first arrived there were only two tables seated (including us). Our server was extremely friendly but we spent most of our meal sitting around and waiting for him to come back. It seemed as though the busser did all the work! I'm pretty sure the server forgot to bring our entrees when they were ready because the busser ended up bringing it out and it was almost room-temperature with cold, slimy and thick sauce as if it had been sitting out for a while. (We both ordered pasta.)\n\nOur server never came and checked on us to see how the food was or if we needed anything else. Completely not even exaggerating-- he didn't even glance at us from the time he took our order to the time he came and dropped off a dessert menu (literally 20-25 minutes AFTER we had clearly finished eating).\n\nTHE FOOD: The portions are very small compared to many other Italian restaurants in the area. The temperature of the food was completely unacceptable and I would've said something except (as I've already indicated) we couldn't get our server's attention unless we wanted to cause a scene. \nI got the Gnocchi Zafferano and I usually love gnocchi but whatever I got tasted like the little dumplings in Campbell's Chicken & Dumplings soup. I asked my husband how his food was and he just shrugged and said, \"It's okay.\" I tried a bite of his pasta and had the same kind of shoulder-shrug feeling. The food wasn't bad, it was just boring.\n\nAll in all-- I hope our server was just a bad apple or having a rough night because he was awful. The food was less than decent-- not even worth half its price. I definitely wouldn't recommend going to Ferraro's."

One of our party had the special of the day Sea Bass which Virgilio highly recommend and turned out to be the best Sea Bass he had ever tasted and coming from the NW that says a great deal. I had veal with a caper sauce which had a balance of flavors paired with broccoli rabe. The bitterness of the broccoli  really balances with the creaminess of the sauce and the brine taste of the capers. The others in our party also spoke extremely high of their meals and stated it was the best meal the have had in Las Vegas.\n\nOur server Virgilio was not only a very gracious waiter but was informative with suggestions, recommendations, knowledge of the food and preparations but also was easy to get along with in a teasing manner and would ask for him next time we dine there.\n\nI must mention that we did receive a very special treat from a gentleman who does a fantastic private magic show randomly at tables, if he offers to do one at your table make sure to watch closely it is excellent. \n\nFive days later back at the office we are still talking about how great Ferraros was and look forward to next years trip to Las Vegas so we can visit again."

A couple  years ago my husband  and I  tried Ferraros and now we are hooked. It is my favorite  Italian restaurant  in Las Vegas. I just love that they make homemade pasta!!\n\nI think the service is very good, the ambiance is romantic , great wine list, the price is reasonable for the whole experience  and the food is always excellent. I really like pesto  and their complimentary  pesto oil with bread is so good. I always get the caprese with pine nut appetizer and the stuffed veal pepper. They both are wonderful.\n\nFor the main course my husband  and  I  both get our own Pappardelle  Mimmo entree. It is incredible! Homemade Pappardelle pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus  in a butter truffle sage sauce. This dish melts in your mouth. Pure perfection! My husband doesn't like truffle so he gets it with the butter sage sauce without  truffle. I've tried other items before and they are amazing too. \n\nWe end this feast with tiramisu and cappuccino. I'm not usually a big fan of tiramisu but I like theirs. Overall I highly recommend this lovely restaurant!"

We were walking to a concert at Hard Rock; weren't dressed for the lame/empty Lawry's, 15-20 min wait at Fogo Da Cho even though they were totally dead. \n\nWalked past Ferraro's, figured we'd give them a shot. Typically not a fan of Italian food, because, like Mexican food, it's basterdized and dumbed-down considerably in the interest of ignorance and economics. Very rarely do you find a place that actually makes authentic, no holds barred cuisine.\n\nThis is one of those places. It's a real old-school genuine Italian restaurant. Lot's of dark wood, low lighting, a menu with names I can't read and some very apropos live music in the bar area. If you're into wine, the list is phone book thick. We flipped through it just for fun, but seemed like lots of depth.\n\nAbsolutely outstanding service. Our waiter, Mike (who looked like a close cousin of Vin Diesel), was a true pro. He, along with his support staff in the dining room, were great. Drinks never ran dry, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and everyone seemed happy to be there. We do not have service this attentive and friendly very often.\n\nPretty big menu, much more than what I initially perused on their website. Daily specials sounded solid, and Mike was able to make some suggestions for me. Girlfriend had an outstanding ribeye, perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. I had some really great tortellini; very rich, great flavor and texture, perfect size portion. You can really tell that the pasta is made everyday in house. Best pasta dish I've had in years.\n\nThis place is a true gem, and was certainly the highlight of our quick weekend trip. Highly recommended, and certainly worth the quick drive off-strip to get to it."

Yummy! The cheesecake was stellar , rich and velvety and topped with fresh raspberries , now for mine! The pastachio passion was amazing !! A pastachio creme over a sweet cream cheese filling in a nutty/ buttery crust!! Each bite was heaven! I definetly will be back to try dinner!! Although not cheap! I'm sure of it is any way as great as their  homemade desserts I will be sure to enjoy !!"

The pizza was a 6 slice 9 inch personal pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mearballs - the crust was thin enough to be crispy and thick enough to be pizza crust and not a cracker. The ravioli were delicious, but there were only 2 - the light sauce and thin pasta were excellent, and I could have eaten 10 or 20 of them. The gnocci were light and airy with a gutsy sauce. All of the sauces were delicious, and all were different savory delights. All of the food was served hot. We both were delighted to share the pistachio creme dessert. It was light and creamy and served cold (one of my pet peeves is when you order a cold dessert and it is lukewarm or frozen when it's served) - not too sweet, and really delicious.

We loved it so much, we ate there twice during our trip, and had wine on the patio a third night.  The service was AMAZING.  Ana took such great care of us, and remembered us the next night we came in.  We dined on the patio one night, as it was a beautiful night in Vegas.  The food is fresh and uncomplicated, pure delciousness.  The first night I had a filet and mushrooms, the sauce was DIVINE.  We had a superb lentil soup, as well. My husband had the buccatini with tomato and pancetta, and it was so good, he ordered it the next time, as did I.  The staff was respectful of my no-cheese request.  The wine list is stellar, as well.  \n\nWe had two perfect nights of dining here, completely turned me around from thinking Vegas restaurants are over-priced and under-whelming."

It came as a recommendation from a fellow Denverite who knows his Italian food.  My wife, two children, and two business partners attended dinner here over the weekend.  I had the Agnolotti which I thought was pretty good.  My wife had the Spaghetti Polpette and kids had the white pizza.  Later I found out my wife found a strand of hair in her spaghetti but short of that everything was amazing.  The ambiance is that of an upscale Italian restaurant which was a surprise given the rough exterior.  Overall, I'm pleased and I'd recommend others try it out."

Now they just make it too complicated.  It's only 50% off food and only certain items, not the specials.  No splitting checks.  They add a mandatory 18% gratuity.  No Restaurant.com certificates.  And no happy hour when opting for the 50% off deal.  The food is overpriced to begin with so 50% off just gets it down to a normal price.  \n\nI've been here a few times for events and it takes them forever to set up and seat us.  And the last time I came for lunch on a Friday, it was almost completely dead and they seemed kind of perturbed that I was even there.\n\nIt has been more crowded when I've been there for dinner.  Occasionally, I've seen a live piano player there, which is a nice touch.  But it did make the place very loud.\n\nThe Insalata Mimmo was quite good.  Not sure if it is $14 good, but still tasty.  But I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."

Gorgeous restaurant with nice outdoor dining area and fire pit- some nights they have live music. Killer 1/2 off deal for locals fri/sat nights. My favorite is the Spaghettini Scoglio which has tons of shrimp, scallops, clams, calamari & lobster in a light tangy tomato sauce and the insalta Mimmo which has heirloom tomatoes, avocado, red onion & fresh mozzarella-- but, everything i've had on the menu (especially the steaks) are AMAZING."

Seriously, in 2012, they can't split up the check on multiple credit cards. \n\nOh, and the food was mediocre."

Their ravioli's were simply amazing.  Hands down - the best I've had.  We split their ravioli special as an appetizer (which I'd highly recommend doing) and then had their veal chop which was also great - but the ravioli's were the star.

Never, so you can imagine my excitement when I found out I had not 1, but FOUR other beautiful dates joining me this year on that special day.  Tonight, we decided to do it big, not only because it was Valentine's, but because this was my 200th Yelp review!!!  We wanted to check out a fine dining restaurant close to the strip so we stumbled upon Ferraro's.  \n\nThe minute you pull up, you can tell you're going to be treated to a dramatic evening.  The outside is accented with stone and the low lighting shows a sneak peak of this intimate restaurant.  Red and white awnings add a little color and pizazz.  When you walk in, the first thing you'll notice is the very dramatic chandelier. The restaurant's red and yellow combinations offered a very passionate dining experience which made me realize this was an excellent choice for couples on Valentine's Day. The hostess stand included granite counter tops and etched glass.  I knew this wasn't my typical restaurant visit and that I needed to be prepared to throw some cash down that night!\n\nOne thing that did turn me off was the fact that we had reservations for 5:30pm and still had to wait for 15 minutes.  A party even got sat before us.  I didn't want to say anything because I didn't know the complete story, however, my perception made me a little irritated.  After the wait, we were sat in our own little room, close to the bathroom.  Our reservations were for 5 people, we got sat at a table for 8.  Kind of big, but I still appreciated having our own room.  Our server assistants were super nice.  My water glass was never empty and our table was constantly kept in an organized state.  Another thing that bothered me was the fact that our actual server didn't have much patience with our party.  It almost seemed as if he didn't think we belonged there.  I mean, he's probably right.  We love humble places, but let us enjoy it!  It's a special occasion!\n\nOne very impressive thing was their extensive wine list.  67 pages long!!  They also have an option to tour their wine cellar which I thought was super amazing.  Our party ordered two bottles that evening:  A Sauvignon Blanc and a Pinot Noir.  I don't exactly know what kind of Pinot we ordered, although I know it was from California and about $50 a bottle.  As for the Sauvignon Blanc, we ordered the Ferrari-Carano, Sonoma County '10 for $45 a bottle.  It was light and crisp.  Not sweet like a Riesling, which I LOVED!  Great choice.  \n\nNow onto dinner.  I decided to get the Risotto Funghi, Prosciutto e Porcini for $32.  As described on the menu, Italian vialone nano rice, porcini mushrooms, proscuitto.  No joke, THE BEST risotto I've had to date!  I love a great risotto and this dish did not disappoint.  Probably the most creamiest rice, huge pieces of porcini mushrooms and stems.  Add in the smokey flavor of crispy proscuitto and I was seriously in heaven.  I had to eat this slow, just to savor every bite.  That's how amazing it was. A good friend of mine had the chef's special, a Chilean Seabass with champagne sauce and black truffles for about $50.  There were other dishes ordered, however, those are the two that really stood out to me.  The food made me take a step back and realize how good life was.  Nothing better than food that makes you sit back and think of life's many wonderful things.  Super cheesy but it really made me feel that way!\n\nNow I'm not a person who can afford this type of dining every night.  Every person on the table paid $75 each that night. Definitely somewhere you can visit on special occasions like Valentine's Day.  If you want to try an amazing Italian restaurant on a special night, please come by and check out Ferraro's.  The food alone makes you kiss your fingers and yell, \"delizioso!\""

The food is still amazing.  My dad is a big fan of osso buco and he said this is one of the best.  I would definitely recommend the pasta I got, the Pappardelle Mimmo which is a seafood and truffle pappardelle.  We ordered a different ravioli this time and it was also delicious.  I would recommend the pasta here, even though the meat dishes are very good, the pasta is really where this place shines.  Oh and also there was a really beautiful soft mozzarella and prosciutto salad, but the menu changes seasonally so it may not be there when you go.\n\nAlso as a heads up, the building is in a strip mall and doesn't look like much from the outside.

The Ferraro house salad is simply delicious which consists of arugula, fennel, grape tomatoes tossed in an olive oil balsamic vinaigrette topped with roasted pine nuts. We also had the calamari, but it could of used a couple more minutes in the frier to give it it's golden brown color hue to the breading. The calamari we received were a slightly on the pale golden color. The bartender was a bit rude in the beginning, but as the night progressed she ended up being nice.

How cute is that? We told him what we were ordering for our meal as well as our price range and he brought the perfect wine for our meal. We shared everything so we could try more items and they were awesome and split everything for us. First course we had insalata mimmo. Endive with heirloom tomatoes,  luxurious mozzarella and avocado. Next we had the paparedelle mimmo which was house made pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter and sage. For real??? We also shared filetto di manzo... Beef tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. So tender!!! Sad to say we were too stuffed for dessert. Shh... Don't tell anyone!!!!

We had the worst waitress on the planet, I entertain a lot for business so I have seen it all, or so I thought.  She had recommended a $79.00 bottle of wine.  We politely declined that option and instead each got a glass of wine.  Our preference for a glass of wine rather than a bottle was what set her off into the foul waitress land of no return.  I have never seen anything like it!   After all we are indeed the customer.   You would think she would understand that her job is provide the best of service.   The customer is not there to make her night, and indulge her in what she wants.  I noticed her chatting with other tables and even smiling.  Not for us...Our food came out warm after a long wait.  She never came by to see how we were doing, or even offer another glass of wine.  This restaurant is well known and regarded,  hopefully this was just a one off lemon of a waitress, who will soon find a line of work that she is better suited for."

Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.\n\nb.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.\n\nc.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.\n\nd.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.\n\ne.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu. \n\nI love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great."

The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....\n\nHow can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.\n\nMy wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???\n\nThe waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.\n\nI guess the only thing that would hold me back from coming back here would be the price.

Now I have to stop saying that Las Vegas is lacking in good Italian food.\n\nI don't know if I should start with food or service because both were beyond excellent. We had a reservation and we were promptly seated upon arrival. Our waiter greeted us quickly and he gave a nice overview of the menu options. He informed us that the restaurant actually makes all of their pasta.\n\nWe started with the pesto gnocchi and risotto caprese. I've never been so impressed with pasta. The gnocchi was so delicate and the pesto so creamy and flavorful. I didn't think I liked risotto, but now I realize I'd just never had it prepared well. The next course was salad. I had the Ferraro salad which had an Earthy flavor. My husband loved his caesar salad. For the entrees, I had the ossobucco and my husband had the chicken parmesan. The ossobuco was so tender and flavorful. I loved the sauce that surrounded it as well. As good as my occobuco was, I think my husband's chicken parmesan was even better. Lastly, we had a sampler of a cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was really good with a slightly sweet taste and the shell was something I could eat alone it was so good. The tiramisu was have a moment good. Yum!\n\nThe service is deserving of its own note. It's obvious that the restaurant has made great service a priority and dedicated time to training to achieve this. The staff is very attentive. Our water glasses never went below half a glass, with each course a gentlemen with parmesan and black pepper appeared and the way plates were placed in front of us was very deliberate and polite. They didn't skip a beat and the service definitely made us feel well taken care of while dining here. We'll definitely be back."

One should not have torn artwork hanging on the walls as I found in the side room I was in. And while the wine recommendations were spot on, there were times our table felt ignored...drinks were not tended to, plates were not cleared in a timely manner...in short Ferraro's is a good experience when you're enjoying what's on your plate, but when I'm sitting there with 2 empty glasses for over 15 minutes...at this price point that's not acceptable. \n\n3 Stars.

She gave us a wine menu and suggested pairings which I appreciate because sommeliers can be nerve-racking if you don't know your wines. \n\nOverall: It might've been the wine talking, but I enjoyed myself. The food was lovely and my mouth waters thinking about the lobster ravioli. \n\nLess one star because booths and tables are really close. Upscale Italian? Meh. It felt like an Olive Garden on steroids. Less kitschy Italian homeware replicas, but still that sort of faux interior facade. Good to wow a date and special occasions, but that's about it."

When you go to a nice italian restaurant, you could very easily pay a lot of money for very basic plates, or, on the flip side, a *ton* of money for fancy bullshit California-italian-nouveau food. At Ferraro's, you can get a nice experience, atmosphere, and food that you'll never confuse for the Olive Garden or some chic LA pan-italian-fusion place.\n\nAmbiance-wise, the place has low lighting, and can be very romantic, but can also work well enough for business or more casual meals. Service is usually excellent, and on most nights I've been there, Mimmo or Gino has been around saying \"Hi\" to people.\n\nIt's not particularly cheap, but it's not outlandishly expensive. If you avoid falling into a classical multi-course italian meal, your check will end up very reasonable. There are a lot of italian restaurants in Las Vegas where you can impress a girl, or overpay for a decent (at best) meal, but Ferraro's makes it possible to go to a nice place and get food on par with what you're paying."

The veal osso bucco is the best version of this dish I've ever had, my favorite Italian dish in town, and my 2nd favorite dish overall in the Valley (narrowly losing to a mighty competitor, the reserve ribeye at Carnevino).  But, Ferraro's is so much more than its most famous dish.  They have had, on occasion, a lobster risotto that will make you forget your spouse's name.  We've ordered it more than once and it's worth twice what they charge.  \n\nThe ambiance is very fancy, but the servers are fantastic and make you feel at home.  Wine list is long and can be high, but you can find some good Italian selections that won't force you to eat off the value menu for the rest of your trip.  It's well worth the short cab ride from whatever strip hotel you are staying at, and if you are a local, you MUST come during restaurant week.  The full portion osso bucco is offered for only $50, and it includes a starter and dessert.  It's been one of, if not the best bargain I have found during RW."

Needless to say, we splurged anyhow! \n\nThe service here was absolutely top-notch. We never had to ask for anything whatsoever. This place is class class class all the way. The ambiance was very soothing and romantic. \n\nBut the food was the true star of the show, and man did we go nuts. We got two appetizers - risotto balls and the caprese mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Both were absolutely delicious beyond all comprehension. The caprese - my god. The amount of cheese you get with this appetizer is mind-blowing. The only problem I had with the risotto balls was there wasn't enough, and it's not ideal for sharing because there are 5 of them - make it even! Six would have been ideal, especially for the regular price ($14 - ouch, but sooo worth it!). But I was a very good girlfriend and split the 5th one up evenly instead of devouring it myself ;D\n\nWe also split a house salad, which wow - this thing would have been enormous if I would have had it on my own. Heirloom tomatoes and the right amount of dressing made this dish delicious, and I'm glad I got my greens for the day! \n\nOur entrees were also ridiculously huge and I'm amazed that I finished every last bite. I got the gnocci with vegetables, and there was an excellent ratio in my dish, about one veggie per gnocci. Very tasty but once I got toward the end of the dish I realized it was just a teensy bit on the salty side, but still very delicious. Matt ordered a ravioli dish that he enjoyed very much. \n\nEven with all this food and being full beyond all reason, we couldn't pass up dessert - white chocolate raspberry creme brulee. The presentation was amazing and it was beyond delectable. \n\nI am very happy we decided to change up our Dad's Grilled Cheese anniversary ritual for Ferraro's. From the setting, to the service, to the food, everything was absolute perfection. I will definitely be coming back again!"

Me, our son and husband called ahead several weeks from out of town for my husband's SPECIAL birthday dinner. Then we called to confirm when we got in town. When we got to the restaurant they said they said they didn't have our reservation!! Whatever, let's eat. They finally sat us. We ordered a 250.00 bottle of wine. The risotto Nero is nothing but rubbery old lobster Zatarain's rice from a box!! YUCK!!! My husband got the osso buco. It was bland in a generic sauce with no vege's or tecture. Slimmy meat. Our son's pasta was also bland and very undercooked and I know what al dente means. When I sent back my HORRIBLE RISOTTO NERO that acted rather pissy to me and the waiter just walked AWAY without even asking me if I would like something else. I guess in a very vain attempt to try salvage a tip they sent out 3 little sloppy desserts with very melted sloppy ice cream never even asking us what we might have wanted for dessert! But the creme de la creme insult (excuse the pun) was they actually had the nerve to put a 3/4 burned USED CANDLE on my husband's dessert!! How RUDE. I think when you spend 250.00 on a bottle of wine you should be treated with some respect and hospitality not like the people whom you are trying to insult. I think Michael would have treated Fredo better than this in the Godfather!!  I have learned NEVER order the wine until you taste the food!!"

For me, when I see Osso Buco on the menu, that is what I get.  I love the stuff and would eat it every day if I could.  But, I also don't want to be disappointed, as I've had waaay to many  bad instances.\n\nLet's start with the wines.  After much discussion with our waiter, who either was very knowledgeable or was pushing stuff the restaurant hasn't been able to get rid of (I do give him the benefit of the doubt and think he was quite educated), he recommended the 2003 Palari Faro.  I hadn't even heard of the grape, let alone the region it comes from.  It was enlightening and tasted pretty good, too.  For a second bottle, I ordered the 2001 Pio Cesare Barbaresco.  This was a relative bargain on the wine list.  Over all, I have to rate our server pretty high for his expertise and ability to navigate the list.  Where I have to subtract is from the wine service itself.  While our glasses were never empty (definitely a good thing), our server continuously poured wine to top us off.  It felt rushed.  I would have liked to see the bottom of my glass at least once.\n\nAnyway, I'll skip to the food...that IS why you're reading this, right?  We order three appetizers:  (1) Carpaccio Torcello, which is basically beef carpaccio - the color and texture exude freshness, like it definitely wasn't sitting pre-sliced in the cooler for days (like at some other places).  It was good; however, it just didn't have enough beef flavor for my taste.  (2)  Carpaccio di Tonno (tuna carpaccio) - this was really fresh and the accompanying salsa-looking mixture was refreshing.  The tuna itself had a nice crust that gave the tuna an earthy aroma and flavor.  (3) Burrato, Proscuitto, Rucola - this was like a salad with melted mozzarella and proscuitto.  Interesting mix of crunchy, creamy and chewy.  Good stuff and my favorite of the three.\n\nFor dinner we had the...Osso Buco.  All three of us.  The shank was nicely tender, which is where too many places fail miserably.  IMHO, it could have been a little more moist, but soaking the bites in the sauce definitely made up for that.  The sauce was really nicely done and very balanced: it was rich but not overwhelming, it wasn't salty but had good flavor and, most importantly, it did not counteract with the wines.  Impressively done.  The grains on the side (I can't remember what it was called) were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle and was a nice complement in texture to the rest of the dish.  \n\nAh, but how can I end the review without mentioning the bone marrow?  I picked that bone dry.  It was buttery and fatty and just was astounding with the flavor of the sauce.  My companion never ate marrow before, but convinced him to give it a try.  While I don't think he's completely hooked, I did see him picking a lot of marrow out of that bone."

Well the amounts on the check were not adding up to what people purchased and it was becoming very difficult to distinguish , after about 30 minutes myself and a friend  asked Tony if he could please just separate the check so we could see why the amounts weren't adding up and also to make it easier on us to be able to pay separate checks for each party , I explained to him that it had already been 30 minutes after we had finished dinner and we just wanted to be able to pay and leave and continue our night , as we had plans and places to be . He just straight out told me no he could not and would not do that because it was not possible . I asked him then \" Can you ask a manager to see if they can help us out , since the customer is priority and this trying to figure out the bill is becoming a huge inconvenience  for myself and my party \", he then responds with  \" No I cannot because then I must run 7 different cards and do separate transactions and that would be you inconveniencing me as a server and take up time and before I could get another word out he simply walked away from myself and my friend. I was completely taken back that he would even speak to me in that way , me being a customer who just had a party who spent a good amount of money  in the restaurant. We did find a manager on duty and explained to her what just happened and she apologized on his behalf but said that there was nothing she could do as the max cards they could run were 6 cards . We had 7 and they would not even make an exception and find a way to help us. \n\nWhat really irritated me was that he had made that comment that it would inconvenience him and take up time  and the attitude he had that went with it  and he did not even try to get a manager to help or assist . \n\nFunny thing is...I didn't just look up the restaurant  on Google or yelp, a local in Vegas ( a  good friend ) recommended it and when I told him about my experience he was so embarrassed. \nAlso when Tony took our cards to pay the bill, it took him 15 -20 minutes to come back . Therefore , it still took him a while to run the cards we did give him, so why not just separate the checks like I had asked and let us pay that way , as it would've taken the same amount of time to just accommodate my party. \n\nLuckily this did  not ruin the whole night , but I believe it was  an unacceptable and embarrassing situation for this restaurant owner, The  staff should be better trained than to argue and be rude with customers. we would have  loved to try the wine bar or happy hour next time , since we are in Vegas a few times a year.. but we will not be going back here again. \n\nEva Caudillo"

It's ambiance consists of top of the line decor, romantic and traditional Italian feel with only the BEST professional and attentive service one could ever ask for.  Michael W. was our waiter and did not disappoint.  He was a knowledgable gentleman.  He was patient and friendly.  By the end of the night, we were talking about our stories from New York.  Needless to say, HE IS A DOLL!  The food was perfection.  It hit every button - from presentation, timely delivery, temperature and TASTE!  We devoured the Nonna's Stuffed Peppers!  YUM!  We were pleasantly welcomed into the restaurant and sent off with well wishes and Italian blessings!  Will come back again and again as a local!  If you aren't a local, GO!  Get off the strip and enjoy the food that takes you back to the days of Grandma's Italian Cooking with 5 star service!  Grazie Mille!"

We arrived at about 9:30 PM on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty. We got seated right away and drink order and menus were brought soon after. I must say for being a wine bar, there were no wine menus or suggestions or even asking if we wanted anything other than water from the person who took our order. We waited for over 15 minutes for a server to come take our order. Meanwhile we were filling ourselves with bread. Finally our server, on his way somewhere else said I'll be with you in 2 minutes. For the restaurant to be as empty as it was, this guy was running around as if he was slammed. He comes up, no introduction, no offerings, no welcome... NOTHING, all he said was you ready? My boyfriend said hello to him, and he just stood there as if we were taking his precious time away... gave him our order and he took off... running around like a chicken with no head. We felt very rushed by him. Finally our food came, which was ok not worth the price in my opinion. We made a comment to one of the bussers and he was apologetic but he just said that that's how the server was. For it being our valentine's day dinner it was very lackluster. Kinda ruined our night. The place is beautiful but just based on the service provided to us I would not recommend this place to anyone, and definitely not coming back."

Since I've been searching for a place which offers it for the entire time I've lived in Vegas, I was happy to try it. I was so excited to go there last night.\n\nFirst of all, our waiter, Virgilio, makes you feel like you're an old friend who came over to visit rather than a guest at a restaurant. You're instantly comfortable around him, and he's fun, he's engaging, and he's just a delight. He introduced us to Chef Mimmo, who is the one who decided to add my favorite food to their menu. \n\nAnd OH MY GOD it was good. It was just like being back in Italy. Absolutely delicious. If you've never had vitello tonnato, it sounds disgusting - veal with tuna, mayo, capers, and lemon? Why would you eat that? But, if you HAVE had it, you know that, when done right, it's quite possibly the nicest thing you could do to your mouth. Chef Mimmo hit it spot on. \n\nWe also got the beef carpaccio as an appetizer. Delicious, heavy on the greens to give it a nice bitter taste. No disappointment there. \n\nMy wife got the ossobuco. I got to sample a tiny taste of it, and it was fantastic. I would have sampled more of it, but the expression on her face led me to believe that would not be good for my health. An angrily placed fork in the eye tends to sour an experience. \n\nI had the fettuccine mare manzo. The mushrooms were amazing, the crab was cooked PERFECTLY. I would argue that the truffle oil was unnecessary in the dish, as there was already enough earthiness from the mushrooms. Other than that, though...\n\nLastly, we finished with the pistachio cream. Oh. My. God. It's just like my mother used to make. I didn't WANT to finish dessert, because I'm already fat enough, but a gun to my head wouldn't have gotten me to stop before I finished. \n\nAbsolutely, go here. Yes, it's spendy. But worth it."

Then his staff. We were laughing and having a good time even before ordering wine (very extensive list) and appetizers.\nWe started with the meatballs, arancini, salad, and rigatoni Bolognese. We could not believe how wonderful every item was. We scarfed everything down and ordered more plus a pizza appetizer.

Through a variety dishes from risotto, steak, osso buco, etc it was not as flavorful and tender as I was expecting.\n\nThe experience on the whole was nice though, as I came here for a friend's birthday. I merely asked for dessert and the waiter gave a whole schpeal about how he's risking getting fired to give us a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday girl -- I'm not sure he was telling the truth or not, but I found it more annoying than flattering.\n\nHe also called out a roaming magician to perform tricks for our table.

The antipasto was decent, next time I am going to order the salsiccia calabrese (grilled calabrese sausage with polenta and red peppers). The wine menu is definitely a major attraction, there is so much to choose from and their cave is extensive - was overwhelemed so ended up ordering a few bottles with my group. I would definitely recommend getting a couple of plates and having courses as this is what the style is formatted for - traditional italian food - so order your antipastos, then maybe a salad, then get a couple of pasta dishes as well as a couple of main courses. I ordered the vitello piemontese and would rate it a 4,5 - exquisite, the truffle sauce was perfect, although not as tender as would have preferred a great main course. Other plates that I ordered were osso bucco and the pollo al limone."

The worst part was the VERY overpriced wine list.  I am an experienced wine drinker as I travel and collect wines.  The list was not very creative and most bottles I recognized had a 3x markup.  After carefully reviewing the wine list, I decided to order a beer as I have a hard time paying such marked up prices.  My buddy commented he will also not return.  I will say our server was very good though."

My birthday dinner here was wonderful that we've been looking to come back. \n\nGot Arancini Tartufo for appetizers because those are ultra noms.\n\nMom and Gma had the same thing as last time- the porcini rubbed ribeye, mac n cheese and green bean sides. It was a little too red for mom in law so they had to refire it. We are barely convincing her that at a minimum to get it medium (pink) and not well done so a bit of red gets her bothered still. After the refire she was fine. Grandma didn't care if hers was a bit more red and enjoyed it.\n\nI grabbed Pappardelle Mimmo (Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, truffle) $39 this time around. It was pretty good, a bit rich. The scallops and lobster was cooked perfectly and pretty generous. What I liked is that they had slice truffle on it and not truffle oil. \n\nBF got Costolette d'Agnello (Double cut premium, Colorado lamb chops served with Sicilian caponata) $39. The lamb was quality but the BF felt it was under seasoned. There are like 5 items the BF has been dedicated to learn to cook perfectly and one is pan seared lamb (chops and racks) so he isn't a kind judge on no seasoning. It was the first thing he ever learned about cooking was how to season. If you put the caponata with a bite of lamb then it does give it flavor but the BF did not like the caponata so he ate some of mom and grandmas green beans and mac with it. \n\nI got a beer this time since last I saw they had some rare and interesting beers that are not distributed to stores. I grabbed Bi\u00e8re Du Boucanier Red ($8 for a bottle) which was a lovely Belgian Pale Ale that was a bit hops from the red pale ale style, a bit the familiar Belgian taste, and was a dry champagne like finish with a bit of sweet. I know there are a bunch of lovely wines, but you know what? I'm in a beer phase and don't fucking care. Craft beer can be high end and refined and it perfectly paired with my dish. \n\nWe got some desserts this time around.\n\nWhite Chocolate Navan Creme Brulee w/raspberries ($7.50). I love creme brulee and this was cooked perfectly. Most places just do vanilla bean brulee so the slight change of flavor was nice. \n\nPoached Pears w/ grapes and vin santo wine sauce and ice cream ($7.50). Nice, light dessert. I wouldnt think cooked grapes would be good, but I like them. \n\nOur server was decent. Nice and kinda funny in a cheesy way. \n\nI loved my birthday dinner, but this one had a few hitches with the food so I can only give this experience 4 stars. I still think it's a good spot though so a future late night Happy Hour will be the next visit."

Next was a Classic Caesar Salad for each of us.   My wife and I are retired, and have had many Caesar Salads over the years, and we both agreed this was the best salad we have ever had anywhere!!   Amazingly fresh and tasteful, and the presentation was superb!  \n\nFor the main dish my wife had LASAGNA ALLA GINO...with house made pasta, Bolognese sauce, Bechamel sauce with ricota cheese and tomato sauce.   I had the RIGATONI CALABRESI....with house made rigatoni pasta, rapini, house made Calabrese sausage, Calabrese peppers, cannellini beans, olive oil, garlic  Both dishes were amazingly good.  Excellent from the first bite to the last!!\n\nEric was our waiter and we could not have been more pleased...for sure!   He did an OUTSTANDING from beginning to end.  He shared with us a lot about the history of the restaurant, and its owner, the menu items, and chatted a bit about our trip.  Excellent service though out our dining experience.  I learned that he is a golfer and lived in Portland, OR.  Which was a surprise since my wife and I worked in Portland for many many years (lived in Vancouver, WA)  He shared that he played gold at Camas Meadows GC  which is where I have played many times.

Shortly after being seated, we were brought drinks and we took awhile to peruse the menu to agree on the items we all wanted to try.  We were brought a bread basket with ciabatta and focaccia.  We then ordered the following:\n\nHouse made meatball with a fried stick of polenta and a rice ball\nImported Italian meats and cheeses\nSpicy eggplant\nRisotto with Italian arborio rice, tomato, ricotta cheese, black olive powder\nPesto gnocchi\nCapellini puttanesca\nArtichoke spaghetti with caviar and cinnamon\nHouse made ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, light tear-drop tomato sauce\nTripe in spicy tomato sauce\nOsso buco with farro\nFarm raised rabbit with saut\u00e9ed spinach\nFlourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and strawberries\ntiramisu\n\nNoting we were sharing dishes, the house opted to serve our appetizers and initial four pastas on separate plates with a small serving of each.  The imported meat and cheese plate on the menu as affettati e formaggio was outstanding with a good selection of meats and cheeses.  Along with this, the off menu item, sliced eggplant was excellent.  \n\nWe then moved to the pastas.  The risotto was not cooked enough and was chewy.  The pesto gnocchi and house made ravioli with spinach, ricotta, mascarpone, and mortadella were the standouts.  The puttanesca was also good.  A fifth pasta was brought, an interesting and very tasty spaghetti with artichoke, caviar, cinnamon, and brown butter.  I never expected cinnamon and pasta to be together but it worker very well with the butter and caviar.\n\nFor the main course items, the peppery tripe and osso buco were excellent.  Their menu notes that the tripe is \"awesome\" which it is.\n\nWe finished with two desserts--a flourless chocolate cake and chocolate mousse with strawberries.  This was OK but we ordered one more dessert--tiramisu.  It was excellent.  Soft in texture and not overrun with alcohol, this was a perfect ending, along with a double espresso over ice--to a very delightful two and a half hour dinner with good friends.\n\nService was excellent during the meal.  The individual plating of some of our dishes made sharing easy but sometimes the food appeared lost on the very large plates.  During the second half of the meal, the servers opened the extenders on four sides of the round table so we had more room."

The luncheon prices were actually a bit low for the quality and quantity of the food. I started with a lovely glass of prosecco. The complimentary house bread is available in white or black olive. My main course was a delicious pollo milanese with arugula salad. The only small hitch was that it was served with a pasta that contained an ingredient to which I am allergic. We had mentioned this to the waiter several times, but it wasn't a serious matter since the pasta was on the side. Actually, we were surprised when we saw the pasta on the plate because it was a lot of food for only $10. My companion quite enjoyed the penne bolognese which was also $10.\n\nThe next night we returned with friends, but found the restaurant quite crowded, so we ate at the bar where a full menu is served. The bartender checked twice to make sure that I could have the shrimp and bean appetizer. It might have been the best thing that I ate during our stay in Vegas. Other members of our party split a pizza with beans on it. \n\nThe restaurant is on the darker side. When we returned on the second night, there was an attendant in the bathroom which I have always found to be a bafflingly unnecessary amenity. The bar was lively but not overwhelmingly noisy. Good service on both visits. It was a nice break to get off the strip for a change."

We were walking into the Restaurant and heard very loud voice from inside.Upon opening the door, an elderly couple were being screamed out by the Owner. Who was yelling at them at the top of his lungs to get the f out of his Restaurant. The older gentleman was very upset and his wife(whose birthday it was 71st) was shaking. They told us that they were locals and had a special offer, and didn't tip correctly and the mgr/owner blew up at them and told them to leave his restaurant. Needless to say, we did not keep our reservation and were just appalled by this situation. His behavior was so vile, that even though I have never written a review on yelp, I felt compelled to document this horrible outburst. The elderly couple were not able to post so in their defense here it is. Do not go to this restaurant, there are so many other great spots in town!!!! Horrible, unprofessional and disgusting behavior for the owner. Unbelievable to say the least!"

I will say, the pasta was cooked perfectly.\n\nThe pizza intrigued me, I had something similar at this place :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pizza-bistro-scottsdale-2\n\nIt is a pizza, with potato,  pancetta, shrimp, mozzarella. Oreganos makes it without the shrimp.\n\nTo be 100% frank I was worried about the combination, I couldn't get my head around shrimp being on this pizza, but I was happily surprised, the shrimp turned out to be the best part. This could of been a great pizza, except the potato was cut to think. If cut thin like Oregano's makes it the potato gets a little crispy adding a great texture to the pizza.\n\nWe really did like the setting, we sat outside by the fire pit, it was a nice way to have a late night dinner. The service was very good, attentive without being intrusive.\n\nThe 50% deal meant a check of just under $50, not a bargain for sure (including a glass of wine) but an ok price for what we got, if it had been at full price I don't think I would have been happy, so take advantage of the specials."

On Friday October 7, we came in around 9pm, we spoke to the hostess and asked if it was open seating in the bar area. She told it was and so we choose a high table right by the bar, then we waited, and waited. After 15 minutes of watching everyone walk by and never having anyone come up to the table to offer us anything. We were totally ignored, so we got up and told the manager about it and left. We went to Kaizen Sushi across the parking lot. \nVery disappointed with Ferraro's."

The best Osso Buco I've had hands down with a nice helping of marrow that I shared with the table. This veal shank was juicy and perfectly seasoned with a nice glaze on the base. For dessert we ended up with a mini cannoli and tiramisu cake...wait for it...EACH. Legit Italian at beyond reasonable prices and beyond words when it comes to service and food quality. If you HAVE to have Italian then you HAVE to visit Ferraro's and NO WHERE else!!!"

Somewhat gaudy room, live band doing mediocre covers of pop hits, a magician (!) going table to table doing tricks, and a slightly hyper waiter who wildly exaggerated how wonderful everything was going to taste. I expected to see Dean Martin and Joey Bishop at the next table.  The food was . . . fine, but no better than that.. Fried calamari were an unremarkable rendition of the traditional appetizer, but a bright spot was the marinara sauce for dipping, which tasted fresh and with a good balance of fruit and acid. A buccatini with meat sauce was less interesting -- seemed a bit under-seasoned to me. Veal piccata was a pretty good rendition of that classic, but could have used a little less butter and little more lemon and caper flavor -- it lacked a certain zing. The pricing was very reasonable. Far from the worst Italian food you can find in L.V., but I've got to believe its far from the best as well."

Joe the Sommelier is warm, friendly and very knowledgeable.\n\nMake a reservation (but they usually can squeeze you in anyway!) it gets packed, but I can't think of a better meal in a town known for amazing culinary experiences.\n\nMy four best meals NOT in order (perfect food, and even more perfect wait staff):\n1) Joe's Stone Crab in Chicago\n2) Micheal Mina's in San Francisco (not fair though - they thought I was from corporate and tried to comp my meal (I didn't let them)\n3) Ferraro's Las Vegas\n4) The Four Seasons NYC"

European hospitality combined with a passion for food.\n\nJust off Strip, opposite to the Hardrock Hotel we found this place. Of course through Yelp ;). After burgers, pub food and more of that kind during our three weeks of travelling through the USA I craved for real Italian. Not Americanised (don't no if that's a correct word), but real European. And besides the size of the portions (real American) it came very close. And if one thing stood out is was our waiter Eric.\n\nEric surprised us with his charme, his knowledge and suggestions on the food but most of all with his timing. In all the years in the USA it was the first time we didn't feel rushed and met someone who almost filled in all our needs. Even realizing that we probably needed a cab to get back he arranged one. And detail that probably wasn\u00b4t influenced by Eric, whe never had such a nice cab driver =).\n\nWe we're welcomed with an Yelp appetizer (for checking in) that consisted of Angnolotti and spaghetti. Nice, but so much that we almost regreted ordering an appetizer. Which of course was also big. Glad we shared the charcuterie & cheeses. My love had the rabbit as a main course and I the Angnolotti. Both nice, but with the peperonata and side order of spaghetti way, way to much. Drank lovely wine with it, enjoyed the espresso. All together a beatifull night. And I believe we paid somewhere in the range of $150.\n\nOh, and don't forget to check-out the bathrooms. And bring some tipping money. They deserve it.\n\nNote: I'm no native speaker so excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes."

The risotto with black truffle was unbelievable. They also offered \"white\" truffle on any dish for an additional $50. Not cheap, I know.

When dining at Ruth's Chris, on Paradise, we asked our New Yorker Italian-American waiter for a suggestion for GOOD italian food in Las Vegas.\n\nThis was one of the places he recommended.\n\nLocated directly across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, on Paradise, we found Ferraro's to be a FABULOUS find.\n\nWe shared TWO appetizers... absolutely heavenly.  They make their own fresh mozzarella (soft and creamy with the savory prosciutto)... and the balsamic glaze was sheer perfection!\n\n   Burrata, Prosciutto, Rucola \n   Fresh mozzarella with a creamy center wrapped\n   with Parma prosciutto over arugula salad\n\n   Caprese di Bufala 14\n   Imported buffalo mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil,\n   extra virgin olive oil, balsamic glaze, pine nuts\n\nDinner... we went in two different directions:\n\n   Pappardelle Mimmo for me\n   Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter,\n   sage, truffle\n\n   Filetto di Manzo for my husband\n   Prime filet mignon topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms,\n   onions over arugula\n\nMy pappardelle was delicious.  A lovely balance between the seafood, the light sauce, asparagus, and the truffles.  After having split two appetizers, I took home half of my main course.  My husband said his filet was perfect!  He is quite picky and is not afraid to express any disappointment or hesitation.\n\nOur waiter, Edward, was grand.  He spent time with each of us, explained the specials, the locals favorites, and asked about our preferences.  The additional table staff kept our glasses topped off, the bread replenished, oil and balsamic (and herbs) refreshed.\n\nExcellent, all the way around.  I recommend Ferraro's without hesitation and greatly look forward to a return visit!"

Once you walk in, you see all the accomplishments this restaurant has received throughout the years, and they have every right to boast it. \n\nPaulo did a remarkable job explaining the menu. My girlfriend and I absolutely fell in love with his voice; sounded very authentic Italian with his accent and constant \"bene\" and so forth.\n\nI had the osso bucco and my girlfriend had the gnocchi. I decided to try something ew with this and was delighted at what I chose. The veal shank was cooked to perfection and the gnocchi was excellent. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the crepe. All the food was spectacular. Couldn't help but wait for Paulo to come and grab our check and thank us for the remarkable dinner. I would definitely recommend."

Not sure if they offer the menu at 1/2 price for locals year round, but during our visit it was still going on!  That's EVERYTHING on the regular menu at half price for locals!\n\nWe supplemented the RW menu with Calamari Fritti ($15 / $7.50 for locals): Fried calamari and Spicy Tomato Sauce. This was good, very tender pieces of squid. Lightly breaded with not much flavor/seasoning...almost plain!  Wish these was a bit more zing/kick in the flavor dept.\n\nThe Complimentary bread...nothing crazy here, but the pesto/olive oil combo was nice.  I dipped the calamari in it to add flavor lol.\n\nTasting of Agnolotti : Ravioli Filled with Spinach, Mascarpone, Ricotta, Mortadella, and Tear-Drop Tomato Sauce. Good, but wish there was more to the tasting lol.  They gave up one ravioli, so it was a pretty light portion.\n\nTasting of Gnocchi Bolognese : House Made Potato Dumplings with Bologna Meat Sauce. This was perfect! The dumplings were super soft, tender and meat sauce was flavorful! This was the highlight of the night for me actually, and I would come back for this dish alone!  Gnocchi doesn't usually do too much for me, but this actually wow'd me!\n\nMista del Casa: Mixed Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was actually pretty good, coming from someone that doesn't enjoy eating salad lol. Simple but flavorful salad.\n\nCaprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil. I only tasted the Mozzarella, which was good. Not my kind of dish.\n\nFor main entrees, Osso Buco ($45 or $22.50 for locals): The House Specialty, Veal Shank Braised in Red Wine Reduction and Faro. This was super tender, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth! Sauce was a good consistency, but a bit rich...couldn't finish it!  Tried the bone marrow...ok, but I guess I am not a huge marrow fan.\n\nPollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, a bit heavy on the capers with a strong mustard taste, but good overall.\n\nAnd for dessert, a Tasting of Tiramisu and Cannoli. Tiramisu wasn't overly strong tasting, but good overall. Cannoli had a crisp shell and light filling...good! \n\nService was very friendly, and our waiter even entertained Little Foodie Dude while he ate :P\n\nPrices would be great if you are local, and fair if you aren't...just not as much bang for your buck on certain dishes.  Go with the pasta since everything is made in house!  Give em a try :P\n\nPics :"

            "review": "Again - another place in town that I don't understand the hype.  \n\nThis was my first meal after doing the Buffet of Buffets Yelp event - and I was really hating food, so this review might be a little biased somewhat.  I am unsure however if I would go back and try it again.\n\nMy husband and I had a friend in town, and choose this place to take him to because we were armed with a $50 off certificate from restaurant.com.  We figured for that much, we'd get a lot of food and wine between three people.  Instead, I felt that he prices were really inflated for what we ate and even with the discount, it was one of the most expensive meals I've had in town.  I don't mind paying a ton if the quality is there (see my gushing review for Carnevino), this wasn't really worth it.\n\nThis was a few months ago so I don't remember everything we ordered, admittedly.  My husband ordered a simple spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the Dover Sole, and we had one more entree that escapes me.  But between the three entrees, two salads, and a glass of wine, and with our discount the bill was about $250 dollars which I felt was not real reasonable when I remember all of the meals where I have paid that much.  The quality, while certainly somewhat tasty, it was not remarkable enough to warrant those prices.  \n\nI can think of many other Italian restaurants in town that are equal or surpasses the quality here and is priced much more reasonably.  Don Vito's in South Point, Pasta Shop Ristorante, is another.  And I hate to say it - but Bucca de Beppo and Olive Garden was more preferential to me than eating here.\n\nThis might be a good place if you are a tourist, but for the money I would stay on the strip and try some of the high-end Italian places like Bartolotta, Sinatra's, Rao's, or Nove.  You'll pay in the same range as Ferraro's but have a much more satisfying experience."

The gnocchi at Ferraro's is easily the best I have ever had that was not homemade, simply because it tasted homemade.  The sorbet?  To die for.  Truly, every single meal was spectacular, from pasta to steak to sea food.  The salads were delicious and not too large of portions, the wine was exquisite, and service was great.  From the moment we walked in we were well taken care of, the servers were friendly and helpful, and good at their jobs.  The head guy even stopped by to say hey, which was pretty awesome.  \n\nThe atmosphere of this place was equally amazing.  So much wine, a performer singing covers that were well done and popular (it could be a little quieter) and a good lighting.   If you are looking for a nice dinner for a date, a group, whatever, and Italian is what you are craving, GO TO FERRARO'S!!!!!"

I'm talking grown ass men who serve here as a career and know how to wine and dine. \n\nOur server made us our own specialty appitizer course that was perfect and just what we expressed we would like. \n\nThey have the top list of wines in the US and 10th top Globally! Crazy, right? They even have a wine specialist (Real Italian man that has to be in his late 60's) who came to our table to see what we were looking for a made suggestions on wine's we would like.

I also had the boars meat pappadelle and it was magnificent! \n\nThey also have a great lounge menu if you're looking for a more casual experience! This place isn't too pricey, but it's definitely more upscale which I like. GREAT wine list too, just know they don't allow you to bring your own wine for a corkage fee. \n\nThe service is always great, and definitely a more slower dining expericence to really enjoy yourself, your company, and the food.

My mom and I were looking for some chow before we went to see Divas last Saturday and ended up at Ferraro's. \n\nIt's in a strip mall, but do not let that fool you. I've only been to one other restaurant, ever, whose service rivaled theirs. Our very helpful and welcoming waiter, Eric, made our dinner such a treat! He also gave us really great tips on what to order, and I must say that although it was so out of the ordinary for me, I could not have been more pleased. \n\nBREAD. It needs to be in all caps because up until this meal I'd been forgoing all gluten....but when they sat the basket of warm focaccia and rolls in front of us with the tangy balsamic/oil dipping sauce I knew I was in trouble. There was no way I wasn't going to eat it and can I just say that I don't regret not one bite! The focaccia is buttery and crispy and chewy...all of my favorite things. The rolls were crunchy on the outside and perfectly airy and chewy on the inside. The oil & vinegar didn't last long. I almost licked the dish. I also ordered a side of their marinara since our main dish wasn't marinara based. So delicious....I can imagine the pasta dishes where that is used are out of this world.\n\nWe started with the Beef Carpaccio. It is served with a bed of arugula and fresh Parmesan cheese atop and then Eric squeezed half of a lemon on top of the whole thing and rolled it up for us. I just don't even know how to explain to you how delicious this dish is. Simple, flavorful, and I didn't want it to end. \n\nWhile I was in the ladies' room, my mom ordered the grilled octopus salad. I can only imagine that Eric recommended the dish as my mom would never, ever order octopus on her own! I was a little worried until it was brought out and I got my first bite. It is served cold, diced up with other amazing things that I am blanking out on at the moment, but it was all perfect together. Interesting texture to get used to, but oh so very tasty. \n\nWe shared the Pappardelle Mimmo which is long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, and truffle. So decadent but they also do such a great job of not overwhelming the dishes with any one flavor. \n\nThis was a celebratory dinner and it couldn't have been more of a success. Eric took such good care of us along with the rest of the army of servers who made sure we never had an empty glass."

Place is very modern upscale Italian eatery with various rooms, nooks, crannies, side rooms etc that gives each type of patron from an intimate 2 top to a larger party options.  \n\nQuickly presented with the bottled water option, the wine list etc and two wonderful valued Sicilian wines are offered and IN VINTAGE.

I rolled in with my bandanna and Kid Rock t-shirt, this got our party immediately seated in the back room by ourselves, ha ha. \n\nI might come back for happy hour but even with a $100 off coupon it was still too much."

Because I love to cook and I believe that I have mastered Italian cooking\n\nThat being said, I had an interview that involved being taken out to lunch and this was the chosen place. \n\nIt far exceeded my expectations. Crisp and beautiful interior and amazing service. I had the salmon with vegetables from their lunch special. \n\nThe bread was delicious and they killed the dipping oil. So good and my table mates kept asking for more. In fact, they all pretty much scraped their lunch special plates. \n\nMy salmon was amazing. Light and perfectly cooked and the vegetables were tender but not mushy with a nice lemon sauce. I am glad that I went with that lunch as I did not want to carbo load up. I was nervous but pushed through those tummy flutters because it was so good!\n\nP.S. --I nailed the interview and got the job!"

There is a nice patio with lounge chairs and a fire pit with putting green as well.  Our server was pleasant and attentive and the food was delicious.  We were a party of 9 and everyone enjoyed their meals.  A few ordered veal piccata or veal marsala and thought the dishes were excellent.  Spaghetti with olive oil, garlic and pancetta also got rave reviews from the family.  The restaurant also had an extensive wine list with some very nice wines.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."

The restaurant is cozy, they have an extensive wine list, and despite the \"dressed up\" atmosphere, the vibe is relaxed.  The food was great!  Simple Italian preparation with tons of flavor.  I had the Veal - the meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was deliciously tangy.  I ordered the Grilled Asparagus as a side, which was perfectly cooked.  Everyone in our table enjoyed their meals as I heard a lot of yum-yum noises throughout dinner.  Paolo took care of us and was very helpful with wine suggestions (the Chianti he recommended went beautifully with my dish).  At the end of our meal, Paolo surprised us with complimentary dessert!  We each had a tiramisu and canoli - light yet luscious and tasty!  \n\nThis next part of my review is all about customer service.  Aside from being charming and attentive, Paolo went above and beyond his job description.  He called us two cabs (there were 10 of us) to take us to the Luxor after dinner.  One came and turns out, the second one never arrived.  When our friends finally met us later, they told us that Paolo ended up driving them to the Luxor!\n\nFerraro's is definitely a must-visit every time we are in Vegas!"

(It's the little things) That's why I am both pleased and proud to give Ferrarro's a 5-Star review.\nYou sure as hell wouldn't expect it when seeing their location, a strip center on the corner of Harmon and Paradise. But once you walk insie, you immediately forget you are in a strip mall. Someone clearly put some time, effort, and money into the place, right down to the beautiful Italian Murano-glass lighting fixtures.\nLong story short, everything about the menu is the real deal. Killer wine selection, classic menu, and almost overly attentive waitstaff.\nIf I had any complaint at all, it would be that the fare is a bit pricey. Worth every penny though.\nI recommend the Pappardelle Mimmo, and the Caprese."

Good service could not make up for lackluster, overpriced food. \n\nI had the Caesar Salad and the Risotto Aragosta e Tartufo Nero (Italian vialone nano rice, lobster meat, seasonal black truffles, mascarpone, truffle oil).   The Caesar salad was good. Two hearts of romaine topped with a decent Caesar dressing and shaved Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. \n\nThe Risotto was a total disappointment. If there was any lobster meat in it, I couldn't tell. I could neither see any or taste it. To make matters worse, I could not pick out any truffle taste in the Risotto.  So, essentially I had what amounted to a $38.00 bowl of rice. Even though someone else paid for my dinner, I felt cheated!\n\nOn a brighter note, the three people in our party that had the Seafood Pasta absolutely raved about their dishes. The four others in the party neither complained  nor expressed anything positive about their meals. \n\nFinally, Ferraro's does not allow any outside wine. So, if you have a special bottle for a special occasion, plan on going somewhere else!\n\nThe best way to sum up Ferraro's is: Michelin-rated prices with Yelp 3 star food."

My boyfriend had asked me where I wanted to go and I had told him to surprise me. Well, he sure did and he did a great job by picking Ferraro's. We had reservations but arrived about 30 minutes early. Regardless, they seated us right away. Within a couple of minutes, our amazing waiter grabbed us some drinks, bread + olive oil and left menus for us to review. \n\nWe ordered the cheese platter (Formaggi) as an appetizer & pasta (Fettuccine Pomodor con Ricotta Fresca) for dinner. The pasta itself was more than enough and the ingredients were fresh. \n\nI think what topped it all off for me was the fact that they seated us in an area that was away from the more \"casual\" dining. We didn't have to ask, they just did this. Our waiter created a short lived relationship and shared some stories about his hometown in Italy. \n\nI might add that the Wine Bar has such a large selection. I've seen some reviews on here that complain about how much wine they get but, really? If you're looking to get shit faced off wine with a full \"glass\" of it (lol), you probably don't belong here. \n\n\nI can't wait to return for round 2!"

They highlighted the wines of Santa Margherita and Chef Francesco exhibited his remarkable food paring skills.  The first course was fish, Chef prepared Salmerino Alphino--a wonderful Arctic char (a cross between salmon and trout, fresh cold water fish) in two methods. A sashimi style and a chopped with green apple bits. The dish was very fresh, light and very delicious.  Wine pared was a clean, dry Pinot Grigio 2015, which was excellent.    The next course was Insalata Di Granchio--a lemon and olive oil marinated lump crab salad, with a selection of delicate vegetables and flowers.  This was pared with a crisp and refreshing Fattoria Sardi Rosato 2015. The pasta course Parppardelle al Cinghiali--was a very hearty homemade wide noodles with a fabulous wild boar and vegetable ragu with pecorino cheese.  Very enjoyable and this was pared with Blue Label Chianti Classico DOCG 2012, almost a pinot style wine, this had the black cherries and spiciness but a great mildness to it.  The last course was Cervo in Crosta--hazelnut encrusted venison loin--done to perfection and very tender--with porcini mushrooms and a hearty rainbow chard.  This course was great and the wine pared was a hearty, complex Chianti Classico Riserva 2012.  The food was excellent and the wines were very enjoyable, another great time of learning about the Italian wines and food.  Thank you Ferrero's had a fabulous time. Look forward to the next Taste and Learn series in September."

I brought my parents for the anniversary tasting menu during their visit this past summer, and they loved it so much they brought a group of friends from Illinois out to try it a few months later. So when I saw the ad for the Thanksgiving dinner offering, and my parents were visiting again, it seemed like a homerun. \n\nSadly, we were all very disappointed. The menu was set and you were not able to order anything but the special menu--no substitutions. We all decided to try the Thanksgiving menu: 4 courses including soup/salad, pasta, turkey dinner, and dessert. The salads were great, and the pasta dish (sweet potato gnocchi) was bland but ok. The turkey dinner was horrible. The turkey was a turkey roll. No doubt about it, clearly heavily processed and more than likely frozen. The mashed potatoes had zero flavor (which was strange given that there was garlic chunks in them) and it was hard to tell what was saltier: the gravy or the turkey roll. \n\nWhen I spoke to the manager he stated that the turkey was fresh--the cook deboned the turkeys and rolled them--but it was obviously processed. When I expressed my disappointment, the manager stated they had sold 300 dinners and had no complaints. This was odd as we could clearly see those who ordered the turkey were not sending back empty plates. More than anything it's just a huge disappointment as we decided not to make a traditional home cooked Thanksgiving dinner based on our previous experiences at Ferraro's; none of us finished our meals this time and it's unlikely we will return. \n\nFor Italian food, they are great. But they need the stick to what they know."

Don't bring an ONS here. \nAn announcement dinner: \"We're getting married:\nA business lunch or dinner with clients.\nBachelor party looking for a classy dinner before a night of debauchery.\n\nThey have several wines available (and even wine lockers for the ballers). The beer selection is pretty good too.\n\nMake it happen. This is your spot."

My husband and I were in town for a relaxing weekend after a week-long business trip that I had, and we wanted to eat at a non-casino place. So we googled \"best Italian food, Las Vegas\" and Ferraro's came up as #1 on a Best Of list. So we made reservations and gave it a try.\n\nWe have visited Italy several times and can honestly say that this is the best Italian food we've eaten outside of Italy. My mouth still waters just thinking about it!\n\nThe hostess was so friendly and nice when we arrived. We thought we might want to eat outside since they had misters, so she took us out there to get a feel for it and even with the misters it was way too hot. She didn't mind letting us decide, and happily brought us to an inside table.\n\nOur sever was fun and hilarious. Friendly and attentive. I wish I could remember his name. We asked him to choose the wine for us to pair with our entrees (Fettucine Alfredo and lasagna) and the choices he made were perfect. We chose Fettucine Alfredo because their menu stated that they make their pasta fresh in-house and that is the best way to have Fettucine. It was PERFECT. Also, we love a homemade lasagne that is made fresh with a bolognese and b\u00e9chamel sauce and again - SO GOOD. We also had the caprese salad (amazingly fresh and delicious) and even just the olive oil and balsamic they prepared with the bread at the table was over the top - with a scoop of fresh pesto in the center - OMG.\n\n We just cannot say enough about this place. We will ALWAYS return when our travels take us to Las Vegas. The owner came to our table and asked how things were - and I don't know if we just gushed about our experience, or told him it was our anniversary recently, or just he is a very smart restauranteur, but he brought us a complimentary dessert sampler too! Do yourselves a favor and go here. Best taxi ride you will ever take."

Their food was a little pricey in my opinion and they have a smaller menu when you come in late night with 25% off your bill. \n\nI ordered the pollo parmigiana. The pasta was cooked just right. Others at the table ordered fish. They enjoyed the fish but was disappointed there were only a couple pieces of vegetables alongside it. The presentation was nice but overall it was decent. I would probably go back to just have a glass of wine because of their massive selection, but probably not to eat. With their prices I think I would prefer to go to a steakhouse.

Ferraro's has excellent servers and bartenders throughout the house, but Walter has been my choice from day one one Paradise. Mimo, the owner is without a doubt the penultimate hands-on owner whose one focus is for his customers to be treated like family, and served a meal they cannot wait to tell their friends about.\n\nAll of my guests that have enjoyed the Ferraro experience ask during the year if we are going to  go back again when we are in Vegas.

But, I am back this year and cannot wait to see the entire crew. My biggest problem is deciding between the Osso Bucco, the Pasta with Caviar, and which Brunello to complete the deal.\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to enjoy this masterpiece in a city that offers lots of pricey alternatives, but, few that creates memories of a lovely evening out."

First, our waiter, Apollo, was incredible. He had no idea it was my birthday, but went above and beyond to make our general experience there memorable. He was always there to answer questions, our drinks were never empty, and his upbeat personality was contagious. He brought us a few things to sample, just because. I also couldn't decide between two entrees and he mentioned he would try to get me half of one and half of the other. And to my surprise, he followed through.\n \nThe food was amazing. We started with the Burrata salad and my taste buds were doing tiny little dances. I'm a Burrata freak (one of the reasons I went to this restaurant was because it was on the menu). My boyfriend had the lasagna, which is unlike any lasagna I've ever tasted, but in the best way possible. I can't remember the names of the pastas I had, but based on what I ate, I think one would be hard-pressed to find one they didn't like.\n \nThe night ended with some live Jazz music (which may have been our favorite part). I'm not really a Yelper, I don't really write many reviews, but I was so blown away by our experience there I had to make sure this restaurant gets the great review and Apollo is recognized for his amazing service. Whenever I'm back in Vegas, I'm 100% making another stop here."

The bar maid was not the best and the bartender made some mistakes while we were there, and he just poured it in another glass and added soda water to it.

For my entr\u00e9e I chose the homemade gnocchi with pesto. My wife opted for the lobster ravioli. You sometimes forget how delicious and lite homemade pasta is... The pasta at Ferraro's is just that.\n\nFerraro's provided desert as we were celebrating a special occasion, which was very gracious of them. I capped off the dinner with an espresso and Sambuca, nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention their wine book, it's not a list.

The environment is both very elegant and welcoming...you can absolutely let your hair down and have a great time, while being certain that everyone who works there is a professional. I read with great interest the comment posted by \"Mike N\" on 11/22....it stands out as such an anomoly among the reviews of this restaurant....and it always makes my ears perks up when someone says he never writes a review, then proceeds  to write a really negative one!  Some people only speak up when they have something negative to say...and for people like that, almost everything they say IS negative.  \n\nI am very glad to see that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are commenting on both the outstanding service and food -- beause that's what Ferraro's has.  We've been enjoying this restaurant since its former location on the West side...it is one of our highlights in the city.  My husband and I eat at Ferraro's at least once a week...and I can assure you that Walter and Piero, as well as the GM, Adam, Mimmo, Gino, Jeff, Rick, Ali, and everyone else are 100% professionals. We have truly never had an experience there that wasn't amazing...and we've had lots of experiences!!!  The osso bucco, halibut, sea bass, filet, raviolo (just to name a few) are on our frequent flyer list...as well as many appetizers that I won't mention because I don't know the proper Italian spelling.\n\nThe osso bucco really is the very best I've ever had. Lobster diablo is another top 5....the list goes on and on. jThe extensive and reasonably priced wine list is also a plus. \n\nFor anyone looking for Italian in Las Vegas, give Ferraro's a try...you won't be sorry!!!"

I can't afford most high-end restaurants in this town often, but when it's not my money I will certainly go all out!!  It was a bustling Thursday night and the service was excellent - exactly what you expect the service to be when you are paying those kinds of prices.  \n\nOur party of 3 started with two appetizers - the calamari and the anitpasta meat/cheese platter.  Both were very good.  I've had better calamari elsewhere and would love to try something else next time.  We enjoyed the house wine, which is a bit cheaper than the others but still tastes very good!  \n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the Papperdelle Mimmo - served with lobster, scallops, and truffles.  It was by far the best Italian dish I have ever had.  BEST DISH EVER!  Okay, so I'm not Italian, have never lived in an Italian city, and have never had an Italian friend.  So to me, this was straight-up delish Italian food.  I would have licked the bowl if not for the fact that a.) I was interviewing a job candidate who I want to take the job and b.) I didn't want said candidate to know it was such a rare occasion to eat at a place like that on our salaries, which was not yet disclosed to her!  \n\nWORD TO THE WISE (and budget friendly diners) - this place is EXPENSIVE.  For my party of three with one person not drinking alcohol, our bill was $222 before tip.  Do I think it was worth the money?  YES.  \n\nI am looking forward to trying some lunch specials - which are less expensive - in the near future.  And according to some Yelp reviews here, they offer a LOCALS 50% off - but I wasn't aware of that until now, which is too late.  I also find that hard to believe, but will look into it."

One of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MEALS is their rigatoni calabresi which is homemade sausage, white beans, rapini (broccoli), rigatoni with garlic and olive oil.  Every time friends are in town, we take them here and order that dish as an appetizer we share.  Without fail, some of our friends order it again for their meal because it is SO fabulous. GREAT people, great service and wonderful food every  time!"

We were seated immediately by our waiter Guiseppe on the patio and had wine and appetizers (house-made sausages and very delicate calamari) while the staff catered to our every need.  Once we finished we move into one of the beautiful dinning rooms and began the main part of our meal.  I had the Colorado Rack of Lamb, which was exquisitely prepared although I can also say they have one of the best Osso Bucos you will ever expirence!  This was followed by a delicious dessert of baby cannoli and tiramisu that was out of this world.  I also wish to give the sommelier credit for picking out a great bottle of wine for our table.  This is a must try while in Las Vegas!"

They featured a 4 course meal for $30.30 in celebration of their 30th anniversary but the menu was a big disappointment. Appetizers were good. The mini baguette was very good. The intermediate course, a house salad was the most rustic and an item that should not be in a fine dining restaurant, mixed greens tossed in an over acidic balsamic vinaigrette. The Lasagna was mediocre, you can even see the comparison with other pictures on Yelp, they hold the garnish to save some pennies. The dessert was nothing special, a small piece of tiramisu and a hard to eat cannoli. \nThe wine list is super over priced. I was looking for a good value Barbera or Langhe Nebbiolo for about $50 dollars but it was a mission impossible. They have the most expensive Italian wine list I've ever seen. If you can afford Gaja and Masseto this might be your place.\nI am sure there are a lot of great Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas Strip to try. \nThe owner is famous for his hospitality, however we sat in the waiting area for 50 minutes waiting for our table with our baby and he never came by even to say hi. \nI guess he only shows his hospitality to the rich regular guest who patronize his establishment."

The dining room temperature was a little cool and the hostess offered my wife a shawl while they adjusted the thermostat. I thought this was a nice touch. \n\nI recommend the Caprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil as a starter. The Mozzarella was moist and the tomatoes juicy.\n\nPollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, but a little salty. The side order of roasted potatoes was good size portion, enough for 2 people.\n\nOsso Bucco veal shank braised in red wine reduction and served with Faro was perfectly cooked. I thoroughly enjoyed the entree.\n\nThe wine book is huge with too few domestic selections by the glass but with some help we found some choices.\n\nCurrently if you dine before 5:30 it's 50% off the entire menu. The time worked perfectly since we were going to the theater."

Waiters I talked to were all 3 Italian, or mastered a fake italian accent, o e or the other, which was nice. I got a free appetizer sampler by checking on on Yelp which had a bologna ravioli and a mushroom pasta dish that was all right. \n\nI ordered the Bufala mozzarella and  prosciutto  appetizer, which I have provided a photo of, and it was amazing. I wish it had more cheese but it's real and expensive ($21). The prosciutto was very good as well.\n\nFor the main course I had the Lobster Asparagus ravioli (also supplied a photo) in a light wine cream sauce which was also good but I could tell the lobster had been frozen. However, that did not stop me from eating every bite.\n\nFor dessert i had the white chocolate Montenegro creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which tasted fine however I couldn't taste the white chocolate, just tasted like normal creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e to me.\n\nOverall a nice restaurant a little on the pricy side, although this is Vegas, and good service. I will be back to try their more exotic items on their menu, which includes a rabbit dish they say is their best dish, and a grilled octopus dish, and recommend you give them a try."

Let me set the scene - nice ambiance, attentive service, zero vegan options.  Lots of vegetarian, but nothing vegan (with the possible exception of a salad.)  However, our server was on the ball and they rustled up some egg-free pasta in the back of the kitchen and left the ricotta off the linguine pomodoro.  \n\nI had the pasta ($19) and a glass of Sangiovese ($14), which made for about a $40 dinner with tax, tip, etc.  The pasta was pretty delicious I will say.  Definitely high quality tomatoes, olive oil.  Very simple but well executed.  But I felt like I didn't have $40 worth of dinner.  \n\nBottom line - not worth it to me to pay that much for that little, but I would gladly go again if someone else were footing the bill or if I got in on the 1/2 off locals deal that Adina mentions below.  \n\nEveryone else in my party raved about their food, so if you eat eggs and cheese, you'll probably enjoy the food and feel like you're getting your money's worth."

            "review": "Decided to check out this place last night since it was open late and I was dressed quite nicely so I wanted a dressier ambiance. Came in a little after 11p and it was their late night menu which was the full menu minus 5 items. Everything was full priced but you receive 25% off your entire check if you dine between 11p-2am. I came as a party of 2 and we sat at the bar. At that time there's only bar and lounge self seating available. The bartender was friendly and attentive but maybe that's because there were only 7 people at the bar and 2 in the lounge area at the time. \n\nFritto misto: I really enjoyed the breaded calamari and there were 2 pieces of shrimp along with 4 pieces of smelt fish. Being Asian, I liked the smelt fish thrown in there. It was different. \n\nSpicy sausages: 2 small-medium sized sausages served on a bed of greens. Good flavor but a little on the pricey side just for 2 sausages. \n\nBranzino: highly recommend this dish! Served over garbanzo beans I believe it was? And the skin on the small sea bass was crispy on one side and the meat was juicy and tender. It was easy to eat too. Bones were only found in the tail so I think they deboned most of it before cooking. \n\nSeafood pappardelle: very seafoody.. The sauce had a tangy flavor that blended well with the lobster and scallop in there. The thinly sliced asparagus provided a good crunch to balance out the soft scallop and the noodles were al dente! Only downside was that the lobster was rather tough and not tender, probably because it's not fresh. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for an off the strip, local date night eatery."

And we were looking for a great Italian experience in Vegas, and after checking out pricing, menus and reviews, we went for Ferraro's even though we'd been to the same area for nearly every other meal.....but the Strip restaurants were either chains or way overpriced and not much authenticity in the menu.\n\nRestaurant is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  Host staff were extremely friendly, and made us feel special from the moment we walked in.  Our waiter, Eric, was super nice, very knowledgeable and creative with menu recommendations.  He helped us with great wine choices, and even offered to give me samplers of two dishes I couldn't decide between.\n\nReally was an enjoyable evening, and we enjoyed knowing that we were supporting a local Vegas family-owned operation.  It was definitely worth a special occasion meal, but also friendly enough for two friends to just enjoy an evening together and not feel out of place."

Instead of being allowed to chose an appetizer from the menu the waiter brought us a small serve of spaghetti bolognese and one ravioli to share.  The food tasted bland.\n\nI ordered the scallop dish which comprised of only 4 scallops for $29.00 with some crunchy bits of tiny chopped veges underneath.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the salad, insalata mimmo, which was very flavorful but I didn't come here for salad!\n\nBecause the restaurant was less than half full on a holiday weekend the wait staff circled the table relentlessly like flies looking for crumbs.  They totally lacked a sense of acuity and were intrusive which took away from the dining experience.\n\nBy the way, the small parking lot was full but I was able to find a parking spot without too much trouble.\n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant when there are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from."

We were greeted by a wonderful hostess, and then it went down hill once we sat down at our table. The waitress unfortunately started on the wrong foot when asked about if they had a Malbec in house, the reply was: Yes, It's $200 and I don't think you can't afford that, and we don't sell it by the glass.  I was stunned!  (My husband had returned to the table) to see me, and the others in a shocked state. I would like  to take the higher road and say that I don't believe she realized what she had said to me.\n\nSo in short we settle for the over priced $98 bottle of Ruffino Chianti Classico. The water was great but it lacked the lemon we asked the waitress to bring and received none until we asked the server to bring us some. (With a smile still). \n\nThe menu's came and my husband who never complains about anything was taken back by the prices. Thus adding insult to an already injured evening we ordered our perspective appetizers, and meals and carried on conversations to pass the time.\n\nFrom the ordering of an over priced bottle of wine, ($98) to a menu of food that was good but not off the charts, we could have gotten the same quality and better serve elsewhere. My friend order the Risotto the price was $30.   Risotto!!! Not only was this one the most expensive restaurants, for the quality of food but the service unfortunately didn't add up.  Speaking of service: This evening was so slow that they had a table with a party of 7 who ordered their drinks and their meals up and leave.\n\nAnyway the highlight of the evening:  We found out that if you are a Las Vegas resident you could get 50% off your meals (Alcohol not included of course). Oh! but the waitress forgot to tell my son that...who is a new resident and had left early because of the time. Thank goodness for great friends we met their for dinner. They told us! So that whopping over $400 and then some bill was reduced by the great friends.  So all in all the evening blessing was we got to spend it with our son and our friends who met us their for dinner. No we didn't get dessert!\n\nBeing thankful for good and bad experiences teaches us much about life."

            "review": "I love Italian food, and had been craving pasta for several days.  When I checked into my hotel I searched for Italian restaurants close by. Ferraro's immediately popped up.  I noticed that they had happy hour until 7 PM.  Perfect.  I was greeted by both the hostess and server.  I looked over the menu and asked for the wine list.  None of the pasta dishes on Happy hour were served without meat, so I ordered off of the regular menu ($25-$70). The wine I had planned to order was not recommended, so I went with one several dollars more per glass.  \n\nThe salad and bread arrived quickly, and were very good.  I sat without the pasta dish I had ordered for 40 minutes after the salad was cleared.  I wasn't looking for something super fast, but the wait was excessive. I ordered another glass of wine while waiting. I probably wouldn't have ordered a second had my meal arrived in less time.  When the server passed by half way through the second glass she noticed the pasta hadn't arrived.  She admitted she had forgotten to put in the order. Things happen.  It arrived a few minutes after she noticed.  \n\nHaving been in the service industry for close to 30 years there would normally be a comped glass of wine or something for the wait.  No.  Full price.  While the service (except for the forgotten order) and food were good, it would seem that they would try to make things right at a family owned restaurant.  I don't have an issue with dropping over $50 or more on dinner. However, this was not what I expected to spend for happy hour. Especially since the restaurant is in a strip mall. Overall I spent an hour and a 45 minutes as a solo diner in the bar waiting for a two course meal.\n\nEven if I had planned on having a regular priced dinner, the entree prices were at least 25% higher than they needed to be, though the food was good. I would most likely take a cab elsewhere next time, or grab a sandwich or slice by the hotel.  Las Vegas has many great restaurants, and I'm here on a regular basis.  Had I felt they were interested in having me as a repeat customer I would gladly try them again."

The waiter who was assigned to our party was just like Alfred from Batman!  He was at our beck and call.  He was attentive to our needs, very knowledgeable of the Italian food lingo and he wheeled n' dealed us on the most prestigious dishes on the menu.  Not to mention his team of bus persons who hawked us for any breadcrumbs to be immediately scraped off the table.  \nHonest to say, I've been tired of the Italian food fare.  If it wasn't for a deal breaker I found on Restaraunts.com, I would have never considered dining at this stallion of a venue.  Needless to say, The menu items were more on the Bucket O' Gold side, but because of the quality and taste of the food, it was money well spent.  We ordered a number of items on the menu, but the one most memorable dish, out of all things, was the calamari!  The squid was fresh and fried to perfection!  If ya gotta PYT, take her here to start things off.. the ambiance is very dramatic.  If you're coming with a sizeable party, I suggest you order numerous items and have the chef portion the food to the number of people in your party.  The waiter will bring it in individual plates so that everyone gets a taste of  the Fanciness!  ..Fancy!"

So when we saw Ferraro's proudly proclaiming a 9.95 lunch we were in.  \n\nI'm so glad we did it, too.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off of the lunch menu along with a side salad.  I'm not crazy about vinaigrettes to begin with, so when it was only sparsely on the mixed greens, I wasn't thrilled, but I was hungry after an afternoon of libations at the pool, so I ate up.  \n\nThe entree on the other hand, that's another story.  De-lic-ious.  The meatballs tasted like the ones I remember from my Italian, great-grandmother's kitchen; the sauce wasn't over powering or under-seasoned--simply perfect; and the noodles were cooked just right.  The portion was satisfactory as well.\n\nOur waitress was delightful.  Polite and attentive, but not pandering for tips.  Just a doll (I wish I could remember her name, but I do know she work's the bar and has a tattoo on each inside wrist, so look for her next time you're there).\n\nIt's not often that I'm in the middle of Sin City (typically due to the aforementioned monetary setbacks and I just don't much care for Vegas to begin with), but the next time I'm in town and I have the opportunity, Ferraro's is a stop I'll make."

The bar area is really nice for cocktails especially before a show if you weren't eating there, I definitely would go have a drink at the bar.  Their wine list is extensive, definitely a must for wine lovers. \nThe appetizers we ordered were spot on: fried calamari were excellent, the carpaccio was good on a scale of 1-10 , it was an 8.\nThe reason I only gave 3 stars: our main dishes lacked the wow of the appetizers. Ferraro's makes their own pasta, any pasta lover  knows fresh pasta is the best.  Gnocchi with meat sauce- gnocchi had a great texture, the meat sauce was good - separately the 2 were good but combined ? Not so good, too heavy. Bolognese sauce ie meat sauce is a northern Italian sauce, gnoccchi is a southern pasta the 2 don't go well together. The saffron  risotto with shrimps as below par, the rice tasted like it was cooked separately and they threw 6 shrimp on top, the flavor was not combined.  The pasta and the rice dish was not worth the price either: pricey and small portions. \nI will go back to try their signature dish Osobuco."

Was in the mood for Italian but after reading all of the average reviews for the major hotels on the strip, I decided to venture off the strip and take a chance with this place.  It wasn't too much of a risk since the avg. review was 4 stars.  The restaurant is right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.  Parking is in the strip mall.  So we didn't have to spend extra on the valet.  Always a plus in my book.  \nThe restaurant was modern with a classy flare.  Service was fantastic and our server was very helpful in aiding us on our wine selection.  He was very knowledgeable.  They have an extensive wine selection by the glass, half bottle or even sample tastings 1oz, 3oz and 5oz.  \nWe decided to start with the fritto misto (calamari, zucchini & fennel).  The batter was light and well seasoned.  Not greasy at all.  The marinara sauce that accompanied it was a great compliment.  \nI got the 18oz. rib eye medium and the gf got the risotto with truffle and lobster in a cream sauce.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  It had a nice crust and the balsamic glaze made it easier to eat the steak to the finish.  It had a nice burnt crust just like what you get from the grill.  The risotto was al dente and the truffle added a great aroma to the dish.  The recommended wine pairing cut through the creaminess and made it easier to consume.  \nI would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's better than most of the restaurants on the strip and the service is not stuffy."

When I heard Ferraro's was off the Strip, I rejoiced because it was nice getting out of that scene; at the same time, I thought wtf are we going???  When we pulled into the strip mall and spied the \"massage parlor\" again I thought wtf are we going?  However as soon as we walked in my concerns were put to rest.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy and romantic, darkly lit with a small trio playing music.  Not too small and not too large, like Goldilocks said just right.  The staff at Ferraro's was great, being that we were a party of 25 at 8PM on a Friday which is a nightmare for a restaurant you're not expecting much but everyone was quite gracious. The servers took their time to tailor their suggestions for what everyone was looking for, whether it was more information about a particular wine or suggestions for appetizers.  \n\nFood and wine were delicious, well from what I saw and heard from my fellow diners.  I didn't taste what was on everyone else's plates (cuz um yea I'm not going to ask the CEO if I can try his osso bucco), but my food was delicious.  I took a different direction from my co-workers and went with the ribeye, cooked medium with rapini.  When my plate came to the table everyone else got a lil bug eyed because it really was quite large.  My hunger got the best of me though and after being up for 12 hours at the tradeshow I inhaled my steak which was perfectly cooked with a warm reddish pink center and charred on the outside just like I like it.  Rapini was a bit bitter and could have used more garlic but hey who cares about that with a delicious steak.\n\nI have no idea how much dinner would have been, but if I was to come to Vegas again and wanted a change of pace from what you can find on the strip I'd definitely come here again."

He made wine suggestions, all of which were right on point.  I should make a special point about the wine - the list is enormous and is about 98% Italian wines.  I had a wonderful Pinot Grigio that was almost honey colored, and was freaking incredible.  My HOHH tried a couple of different Barolo's, each of which was better than the prior one.\n\nWe ate a LOT - grilled asparagus wrapped with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, a delicious Caesar salad, veal piccata and sea bass with a saffron/lobster sauce.  The sea bass was so good I almost wanted another portion, but managed to control myself.  I don't know how they did it, but the broccoli rabe served with the entrees was almost mellow flavored, rather than the usual bitter taste (which I happen to love).  \n\nFive stars, and I will definitely be back.

It was really good and pair that up with the bread they bring you at the table and you practically have your meal right there.

We had such a fantastic experience several years ago when we were in Vegas that I asked to return to Ferraro's on this trip.  Since our last visit they've moved (better location, nicer interiors).  The setting is lovely, the food is fantastic.  Our server, John, was disappointing.  He was inattentive, did not listen, and seemed uninterested right up until he announced that he gave us the \"local discount\" (good for us).  However, conditions of the local discount added an automatic 18% gratuity.  Clever. \n\nThe busser was very attentive and would have made a far better waiter than our waiter."

We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night but were welcomed in to sit at the bar, where they serve the full menu. I can't really comment on the regular wait staff but our bartender/waiter, Christian, was good and attentive, even though I know he was busy. I loved the ambiance of the place and there was a good, live singer/piano player that was nice and not too loud. I had a delicious glass of wine from Montepulciano, after getting an honest opinion from the bartender to help me choose. We ordered a caesar salad (decent) and the caprese, which was incredible! Fresh, juicy tomatoes with a high quality mozzarella, olive oil, pine nuts and basil. But what I really have to rave about was the rigatoni with sausage and cannellini beans! Ingredients tasted so fresh and the dish was truly done to perfection. I normally wouldn't have ordered this but the bartender recommended it and I was so glad he did. We also had the spaghettini with shellfish and calamari in a tomato based sauce, which was also very delicious and LOADED with seafood! We topped all this off with the cannoli, which is not typically my favorite dessert but came recommended by a fellow regular patron at the bar and it was also amazing! I will seriously be salivating until the next time I get to eat here!"

Always love to find a local restaurant and as an added bonus it's off the Strip and not sponsored by a Celebrity chef.\n\nWe started off with our server preparing for me and my colleagues a pasta sampler which included gnocchi bolognese, lasagna and agnolotti/ravioli. All were excellent! Then had a delicious chicken parm with a small accoutrement of vegetables (escarole and potatoes). Others raved about the Dover sole and one colleague just had a salad.\n\nThe restaurant on top of everything is really nice.\n\nWill now be my Vegas favorite."

Wow!\n\nWe started with: \nFritto Misto $9\nFried calamari, shrimp, fennel, zucchini\n\n- The calamari was delicious and the red sauce that comes with it is so yummy!  It was a huge plate... enough for 3 people to have a great appetizer!\n\nFor the main courses:\nI had: \nSalmone Checca $14\nGrilled salmon, fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh garlic and kalamata olives\n\n- I feel like there should have been more kalamata olives for more flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing, but it didn't have alot of flavor.  I think if they added maybe some more salt & pepper it would have tasted even better.  I would order it again, because it was light and I think could have more flavor next time.\n\nMy friend had:\nPollo Parmigiana $14\nChicken breast, mozzarella and tomato sauce served with a side of pasta\n\n- He said it was good... but wasn't sold on it.  It looked really good!\n\nWe sat outside on a beautiful day and had excellent service!  They let us each use a $10 coupon for our main courses!

My boyfriend liked the food as did I but not enough to come back, my fresh pasta got cold really fast and the sauce was too thick for my taste. Our server was a joke on the other hand, he asked us what we wanted to drink and he never ended up giving it to us. \n\nThe busser noticed we had been sitting there for awhile so he took it upon himself to fill our waters. The server came by and noticed and yelled at the busser in the middle of dinner for doing such. Then when the server offered fresh Parmesan cheese for my mans salad, he said coming right up and once again never gave it to us. My man had to flag him down and then he tells us it's the bussers job to give us cheese when he offered and yells at him again. After dinner he brings dessert which was okay, we sat there for about twenty minutes with no sign of our server we ended up walked to the host desk and asked for the check there.\n\n\nThe stars are for the busser who was doing his job and more, it's unfortunate because that place had potential for future date nights but our server couldn't take any responsibility and liked to push blame on coworkers for his short comings. Very unprofessional."

Absolutely the BEST Italian food I have ever had, anywhere, including Milan, Venice, and Rome.....go figure.  My suggestion to you is a simple one.  Save a little extra money to have a really great meal here.  When you arrive at the restaurant, give the menus back and ask them to take care of you.  Gino and Walter were absolutely fantastic.  I'm already planning my next trip back to Vegas just to take my wife to Ferraros.  Yes, it was that good.  For those who are interested, our party had the Buca Amatrician, the home homemade sausage, Meatballs, rabbit, Ossobuco, truffles, a couple other things and two bottles of wine:  Batasiolo Barolo and an Arcanum.....Yes, I just read all that stuff directly off the receipt:)"

It was the Bucatini Corti All'Amatriciana which was this delicious pasta with bits of Italian bacon in it.\n\nSince the server knew we were splitting our dishes, our plates came out pre-portioned which is always nice. He grated fresh parmesan on top and the dish was filling and very flavorful. \n\nThere was a small mix up with our bill at the end and we ended up paying the check for the table next to us. Our server apologized and quickly fixed this as soon as he realized it.

It sounds like a great deal (and is for the quality you get) but after alcohol, tax and tip my credit card still took a beating.\n\nOur party of four adults (and two kids) ate family-style, which was a great way to sample several dishes. The carpaccio ($14) was well seasoned and topped with arugula and shaved parmigiano. The star of the scallop dish ($16) was a delicious chiffonade of brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts. The two scallops lacked a good sear.\n\nFollowing the two apps was a hearty gnocchi dish ($28) topped with plenty of slices of grilled chicken and heavily doused with pesto. The risotto aragosta e tartufo nero ($36) was rich and creamy, but the lobster was slightly overcooked.\n\nThe filet ($42) was as tender as expected and topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms, and onions and accompanied by potatoes, broccoli and carrots. The rib eye ($48) had a bold, beefy taste and was nicely charred.\n\nThey don't have a kid's menu, but willingly prepared grilled chicken breasts and buttered penne pasta for the two kids ($10 each)\n\nThe six dishes provided plenty of food for the adults, but we still managed to down two desserts. The tiramisu ($12) was beautifully presented -- a large square of creamy goodness that didn't have an overpowering taste of espresso. Finally, we had the white chocolate Montenegro creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($12). The best part of a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is cracking the caramelized sugar coating and this one didn't disappoint as the exterior yielded a delicious custard underneath. Although the white chocolate flavor was too subtle for my liking.\n\nFor a Sunday night the place was busy. The interior is upscale with it's white linens, dark wood accents and classic vibe. It's fit for a date night, power lunch, or just a fun night out with friends if you're looking for something that isn't too casual. It might be cheaper than other Italian restaurants on the Strip, but don't expect chain restaurant pricing. Quality food isn't cheap but this place is worth it, especially if you're a local dining on a Sunday."

I love going out to fancy dinners and splurging every so often so I was super excited. Basically, the ambiance and food were awesome, but the service was so blah that I just couldn't enjoy the restaurant much.\n\nWe arrived right on time and were seated right away. Our server came over and my bf showed him the certificate, but he told us they had stopped taking them. We said we didn't know because restaurant.com usually informs you if that happens with a certificate you've purchased. We were not rude or upset with the server at all and in fact were totally nice about it. After that little exchange, he basically treated us like we didn't exist. We had checked in on Yelp and saw that there was an appetizer offer for checking in and didn't even feel comfortable bringing it up as he had seemed so annoyed about the restaurant.com certificate.\n\nI think this sums up everything he said to us that night: \"Wine? (takes our order) Great.\" And then later, \"Ready to order? (takes order) Great.\" And once we were done with our meals, \"Dessert or are you done?\" To which we replied, \"we are super full, so ready for the check whenever.\" And that's it. When he dropped off the check after running our card, he didn't even say thank you for coming in or have a nice night or anything. Just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table. \n\nNeedless to say, I don't even need to go into details about the food, but I will say that one of my fave places is Gaetano's in Henderson, which has a swanky romantic ambiance and the food is even better AND the service is TOP NOTCH. You always feel welcome and greeted warmly by the owners, unlike Ferraro's."

The ambiance was perfect - the staff was seriously impressive with their service and knowledge. But the food, oh but the food. Keeping with Italian the dishes were simple yet so full of flavor. I started with the pasta fagioli soup - it was made with more of a chicken broth than tomato and the beans were cooked al dente with just the perfect amount of Parmesan to top it off. Although different sauce base than I was used to this light soup will become something I try at home. I couldn't decide between the Chicken Parmesan  or a specialty item a friend was ordering off menu so I lucked out and got my sister to split both with me so I could sample each. Let me tell you the off the menu dish was a pasta carbonara with Italian sausage and was probably one of my favorite dishes I have ever had. I love Italian sausage for all its flavor especially the fennel and spice. This dish enhanced the flavors in the sausage and allowed them to dance beautifully with the light sauce. I paired it with the Martin Ulisse Montepulciano Rose and the fruit of that wine paired beautifully with the spice. The Chicken Parmesan was very good as well and we paired that with the Martin Ulisse Montepulciano Signature Collection which was a nice bit of tannin to compliment the tomato sauce.  My only regret is that no one at the table got the salmon risotto that was a special of the day, I'm sure it would have been rich but based on their skill level I'm sure it would have been fantastic. We finished the meal with some shots of espresso and of course the Pistachio Ice Cream - OMG if you've ever had pistachio ice cream you know it doesn't always have a ton of flavors but this blew away anything I had sampled before. How they managed to get the pistachio to be the soft but sensational star of the show yet not over power the delicate ice cream is beyond me. It was delicious. I can't wait to go back again."

I was in the mood for a light dinner and headed to the strip mall where Ferraro's is located.  I entered and was immediately floored by the prices.  They do realize they are in a filthy strip mall, sharing space with a Piercing Emporium and a shady looking massage parlor?\nI was by myself and, although there were tables in the dining room, the hostess clearly wanted me to sit in the bar, so I followed her there. \nShe asked me if I needed the wine list, but I did not; I then sat for SIX minutes, no menu, no drink, no food, no bread, nothing.  Doesn't sound like such a long time but when you are hungry, it seems like FOREVER.  Maybe they were hoping I would leave??\nI eventually placed my order and a bread basket came.  My server was courteous but semed a little distracted, subtly implying that she had bigger and better tables to get to.  She was helpful with menu choices and I placed my order.  The bread basket arrived and fairly quickly my salad arrived.  I had a chopped salad which was a delicious blend of iceberg lettuce, black olives, Italian meats and a light oil and vinegar based dressing - very good!  Unfortunately, I stumbled on my next order, you see, several of the items (pasta, pizzetes, etc) had both Italian sausage and BEANS on them. My server explained that this was due to the chef's Tuscan influence. When I ordered the pizzete, she recommended the white pizza ( blend of garlic and cheeses) but I went with the Pizzete Toscani with the aforementioned sausage and beans.  Bad choice.  It was neither tasty nor appetizing.  Food 2/5, service 4/5, 3/5 stars overall."

I've been a regular since I moved to Vegas three years ago and my girlfriend even gets frustrated because it's the only place I ever want to eat.  For a great lunch join Nina at the bar.  The \"love your lunch\" specials include soup or salad and a delicious entree!  Free for happy hour?   The small plates happy hour menu is the best deal in town.  Ask for Anna, she's the sweetest waitress in the lounge.   If you are a Vegas local, Ferraros has AMAZING local deals every night....just ask your server.  If you sit in the dining room you need to ask for Kimberly. Not only is she knowledgeable about the menu, but so funny and makes for a most enjoyable evening. My favorite dishes include  all the homemade pastas, the osso buco,  carpaccio,  the dover sole.....and I always save room for the pistachio passion!  For a romantic date night,  dinner with the parents,  or boys night out.....Ferraros is the best restaurant in Las Vegas!"

Started out with an Italian app plate of cheeses and paper thin sliced meats. Delicious. The salads were unique and fantastic... from the arugula, fennel and fresh orange salad in balsamic to the more expected wedge. Half our party has steaks and half pasta and all were ecstatic about their selection. My homemade pasta dish (buccatini, pancetta, in a garlic tomato sauce) was outstanding. Steaks were prepared as expected. And the tiaramasui and gelatto were exceptional and authentic. A delicious meal... and with the half-off locals special, well priced too!"

My dispute with Ferraro's restaurant in Las Vegas was on a charge of $400 for cancelling a reservation less than 48 hours before the time we were to be there. After lodging 3 disputes with my credit card company and finally having to have American Express' Advocacy Department call Ferraro's twice they issued an initial credit for $25 and later a credit for $125 (after the second call) for a total of $150. I have to give kudos to American Express for pursuing the issue, but mostly for making up the difference and crediting my account for the additional $250. That is why I have used American Express as my main card for over 30 years."

It's like talking about a broken relationship which started with beautiful moments and ended on a really sour note. It's almost painful to talk about it. But for the sake of yelpers, here goes...\n\nI've been a customer of Ferraro's for more than 10 years. Since it's days on Flamingo. I'd held business lunches, family dinners, business dinners, happy hour gatherings, etc. at Ferraro's. The food was good and the service was impeccable. That all ended one fateful March evening in 2014.\n\nI was hosting a party for 18 business associates. Of course, I had hit up my trusted Ferraro's and made a reservation with them 3 weeks ahead of time, requesting a private dining area. They said OK, it's available. When I got there, I was informed that they at a problem with the reservation and the area was being used by another party. So they sat us at a long table right by the bar. Hmm, I didn't quite like that, but brushed it off. Well, that was the start of the end...\n\nService was incredibly slow. We couldn't get the attention of our server to get our drinks refilled or orders placed. Then, surprise, surprise, appetizers arrived at our table. Chef's choice. Who ordered those? No one from our table. Ooooh...must be compliments of the chef? But no, I was charged a hefty sum for that, I found out later.\n\nOur server finally came around to taking dinner orders at 8:30pm. I ordered a filet mignon, medium rare. When my steak came, it was so overcooked, there was only a slight hint of pink. At best, a medium well. Definitely not medium rare. I spoke to the server and she said flippantly said \"oh, that's how we do medium rare at Ferraro's.\" What?? Excuse me, even culinary school dropouts know that that ain't medium rare. So I sent it back.\n\nThe next time it came out, it was blue. It was seared 2mm on both sides, the rest of the meat inside was as rare as sashimi. Everyone at the table was appalled. I think one of them heard my steak moo. As for me, I was beyond words. Surprised, appalled, angry, disappointed. I try to see it in every positive light possible (steak and eggs breakfast!) but it comes back to one cold hard fact: this was a loud f-you from the chef, to a loyal and very nice customer of 10 years who had spent a lot of money at this joint. \n\nAt this point, I realized that our relationship is over. Time to move on. Plenty of fish in Las Vegas..."

The service was crap, the \"fresh made pasta\" was way under cooked (hows that possible?) and I am familiar with \"al dente\"....but crunchy spaghetti??? C'mon. \nWe ordered the \"exotic\" cheeseplate to start....LOL, the ding dong waitress had no idea what the cheeses were so we were left guessing.....although it was a fun game, not even 3 star service.  She suggested provolone was an exotic cheese. Precious. \nOrdered sparking water and the waiter kept filling my glass with tap;( and then bringing me a new glass each time.\nThe lobster ravioli wasnt bad, but nothing special. My friend had spaghetti and meatballs and it was BAD. How does an Italian restaurant screw up spaghetti and meatballs???? The noodles were crunchy and the sauce was like canned tomato sauce heated in the micro and the meatballs smelled like canned dogfood. As we left, an older gentleman( owner? Manager?)  asked if everything was \"ok\" and I said \" it was ok\" and he was offended and questioned in his hammed up Italian accent \"where we'd had better food?\"  I told him \" I make better spaghetti and I'm Irish\" he didnt think it was funny and asked no more questions;) Do not eat at Ferraros....go to Olive Garden or Mac. Grill and save yourself $100 or pick any other Italian place in Vegas, great odds that its better."

Everyone was happy with the quality/taste of the food and the drinks, but unfortunately, the service was sub-par.  Our server seemed like he would rather be anywhere else than in that restaurant.  That is such a shame, when there are quite a few unemployed people who would be happy to take over for him.  AND, to top it off, we were there for HAPPY HOUR, where they advertise 25% off of all drinks during that time.  NOT ONE of us received our tabs with the discount on it, and we all had to give the checks back to the server so he could correct them.  PLEASE, he didn't seem like he was new at the job, so the only conclusion I could come to was that he was trying to rip us off intentionally.

We really enjoyed the ambiance of the West Flamingo location and lamented its relocation. We've been to the new Paradise Road location twice and are still trying to warm up to it. Two things that have never changed, and in some ways have gotten better and better, are the food and owner Gino's hospitality. There are new menu items, a wider range of appetizers and side dishes and more nightly specials. My wife absolutely loves the melt in your mouth gnocchi, but last time it came with a gorgonzola cream sauce. She's not a big fan of gorgonzola so ordered something else, but this time it had a saffron cream sauce that was beautiful. I had the pappardelle mimmo, which was heavenly. Fork tender scallops, lobster, asparagus with butter, sage and truffle. If it wasn't a nice restaurant I'd lick the plate. We started with the mozzarella with parma prosciutto over arugula salad. The salad was a bit overdressed but otherwise was absolutely delicious. We ended the meal with a cannoli, a perfect topper to the meal. With three glasses of wine our bill came to $150, including tax and tip."

We showed up about 20 minutes early and got a table immediately in the back room of the restaurant next to a table that was set up for a large party. Our server, Kimberly, greeted us and went though the water preference, specials and \"things we needed to know\" spiel. My boyfriend was currently doing a water cleanse and was not dining. She was very accommodating and VERY nonjudgemental, engaging him in questions about the cleanse and alerting the bus boys to not fill his water glass throughout our visit. Our friends ordered a nice bottle of wine and I ordered a glass of white (told her I liked sweet and she immediately suggested Moscato which I could not drink fast enough!). I had a caesar salad before my meal  and it was delicious. We shared a beef carpaccio which Kimberly cut and served to us. Again, delicious. Then, on to the main courses. I had lobster ravioli topped with a nice cream sauce and shaved asparagus. TO DIE FOR!!!!! My friends had the rabbit and veal both of which did not disappoint. Dessert was also amazing, we had cannoli, tiramisu, crepes with nutella (!!!!!!!!!!!!) and poached pears. I loved that my cappuccino came with a rock candy sugar stick to sweeten, I have never sent that before. Although Kimberly's large party arrived while we were mid-meal, she remained attentive as did the server assistants. I was more than pleased with my experience and cannot wait to dine here again. Everything was perfect from the first impression, Kimberly's service and to the maitre d' sending us waddling into the night with a handshake. Not going to dinner here is doing yourself a HUGE disservice. Do not miss out on Ferraro's! *** Also they LOVE locals!!!!"

Sampled the other entrees from dining campanions and was impressed with theirs as well. The service was outstanding - everyone was gracious and warm. Pricey?

This was our 3rd visit and we plan on going back the next time we are in Vegas.  It is family owned and operated and it's obvious that they take great pride in the the food and customer service.  Our waiter was a handsome nephew from Calabria, who made sure our wine glasses were always full and was never away from the table too long.  \n\nMy friend and I both started with the Insalata Mimmo...Heirloom Tomatoes, Avocado, Red Onions, Fresh Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Aged Balsamic Vinegar in a Radicchio leaf.  Absolutely delicious.  The guys had Cesar salads and said they were great.  I had the Gnocchi di Patate with Pomodoro sauce and freshly grated Parmesan and it was perfect!   Our friends had Lasagna and Pappardelle Mimmo...which consists of Lobster, Scallops, Asparagus, Butter, Sage and Seasonal Truffles.  They both said their entrees were outstanding.  But the real star of the table was my husband's Osso Bucco, the specialty of the house.  O.M.G.  My Gnocchi was delicious but I kind of kicked myself for not ordering the Osso Bucco.   I kept sneaking pieces from his plate, which I normally don't do but yes, it was that good.\n\nTheir wine prices are a bit inflated so we stuck to something inexpensive but with food that good, it really didn't matter.   And darn it, we were too full for desert :(\n\nAnd I can't forget the live music a few feet away from our table.  We joked that their band consisted of guitar, saxophone, piano and defibrillator, LOL!  But they were quite good in a loungey sort of way and it only added to the dining experience."

            "review": "One of the few restaurants in Vegas that lived up to its hype. My boyfriend and I wanted to find a nice italian restaurant and came here for lunch. The interior decor is romantic and has a modern rustic italian vibe. We were immediately seated by the hostess and our server came to explain the menu to us. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. \n\nCARPACCIO DI MANZO- thinly sliced prime sirloin, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano cheese, and truffle oil\nOur server recommended this appetizer and it was amazing! The meat was sliced so thinly and it was so fresh and I loved the earthiness of the arugula and the creaminess of the cheese. The truffle oil added a nice creamy and savory touch to the dish. The lemon was a nice addition to the meat as well because it provided a nice tangy acidity. \n\nSPAGHETTI VONGOLE E POMODORINI- homemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic and cherry tomatoes\nThis dish was very fresh. There were plenty of clams and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly. I only wished that there was more flavor. The olive oil didn't provide much flavor and I tasted a hint of garlic. The cherry tomatoes added a nice sweetness to the dish, but it wasn't enough to coat the whole dish. \n\nSALMONE GRIGLIATO ALLA CHECCA\nSalmon grilled with Fresh Tomatoes, Basil, Fresh Garlic and Kalamata Olives\nThis dish was very flavorful and saucy. I especially liked the home made sauce and the cherry tomatoes because it added an extra layer of acidity. The salmon was cooked nicely and tasted very buttery and tender. The rigatoni pasta was soft and flavorful.\n\nTIRAMISU- classic italian dessert made with lady fingers, mascarpone cheese & espresso\nThis dish came out beautifully and it tasted as great as it looked. It was creamy and moist and I especially liked the strong espresso flavor. The lady fingers were soft and soaked up all the flavor and the mascarpone cheese was so creamy.\n\ni definitely want to come back here when I'm in town. They have such great service, the food is fantastic, and it's such a cute place to go to on a date."

So this time when one of my colleagues suggested we go there for their Osso Bucco, \"it's the best\" he claims, what kind of Italian would I be to turn that down? We were at the Hard Rock Hotel for a meeting and made our way across the street to a strip mall where this gem is located. It was lunchtime, late lunch, and we were hungry!\n\nFirst I will say, the service was excellent. Courteous, efficient, and always with a smile. The atmosphere was just right, matched the quality of the entire experience. The menu and wine selections were well varied, not too much, not to little.\n\nI had ordered the same glass of wine my friend did, and he came back with the wine he informed me that there was one glass left in the bottle they had on hand. He said it would be 10 minutes before they would have another bottle on hand and would l like another glass complimentary of something else while I wait? But of course! And it was more like 5 minutes until the other bottle arrived. You could not wipe the smile off my face.\nSimilar thing for my friend who ordered a Martini, they poured him whatever extra was left in the shaker into a second glass and brought it to him. THAT is service!\n\nOk, now for the food... It was literally the best Osso Bucco I have ever tasted. It melts in your mouth, in fact I don't think words can describe it. We had commented that it had to take longer than 4 or 5 hours to prepare and cook this masterpiece (not while we were waiting of course, it's an ordeal to prepare this dish). Just as we were talking, the chef & owner Mimmo came out to check on us and he told us it was an 8 hour process. Thank god someone knows how to take their time and care for food as much as Mimmo! We showered him with compliments, our other 2 friends with us had the veal ravioli special and raved about it as well. Not a single person at our table had a complaint. We all swore it was the best.\n\nHow can this experience get any better you might ask? Well, when Mimmo sent out a complimentary dessert plate for each of us we about died! A small piece of the tastiest Tiramisu and a mini Cannoli took em back to memories of my Italian grandmother's skills. They were perfection.\n\nIf you are in Vegas, do yourself a favor and dine here. You will not regret it. It can be pricey, but it's well worth it. I think the places outside of the hotels & off the strip work harder to provide better food and service than the swanky places in the big hotels, and this place proves my theory right. \n\nI will be back to work my way through their entire menu.\n\nIf you visit, tell Mimmo hi for me!\nCiao!"

A short walk across the street allows options galore! \nBased on Yelp reviews, my SO and I went out for our first Italian restaurant dinner that wasn't wood-fired pizza in YEARS. \nSure, I order italian style food at French restaurants, but a honest-to-goodness Italian resto hasn't been of interest. I can make pasta at home any day. \nThe service was 10 star worthy, making sure every detail was perfect, despite our \"wine by the glass\" type of night vs the huge table of big-tipping Italian men. \nFor starters, I got a half portion of gnocci in gargonzola sauce and the toothiness was perfect. There is not a doubt that it was made within the day.  \nThe specials of the evening were a whole fish, deboned table-side or a poached fish. So as not to offend the non-fish eater, I got the poached whitefish.  My French is good enough to know that Beurre Blanc sauce and what the fish was poached in means butter! \nBetween that and the amazing bread basket with butter I probably ate a whole stick. \nBut, what is eaten in Vegas, stays in Vegas, non?"

I've heard great things about this place, and their HH in general, and was surprised to see that they weren't busy.\n\nDRINKS: The Chianti by the glass ($13) is tasty, as was the Ciao Bella ($14) cocktail that I sampled from a friend. The drink discount is helpful, because HH food prices are only valid with a drink purchase.\nARANCINI ($6): Portion of four rice balls served with a truffle-tinged dipping sauce. These were a solid carb-o-licious option. \nPOLPETTINI ($5): Portion of two meatballs, really tasty. Save the red sauce for dipping for your bread basket, it's good.\nCALAMARI FRITTI ($8): Nicely crisp, mix of rings and baby squid, tasty marinara dipping sauce. Hard to go wrong iwth this dish.\nCAPRESE SALAD ($5): Tiny and somewhat boring portion, two pieces of buffalo mozzarella and a wedge each of red and yellow tomatoes. Maybe their classic Ferraro salad is a better option.\nSALSICCIA PIZZA ($10): San Marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage with rapini and Calabrian oil. The sausage is not spicy, don't let that turn you off. Pizza is a decent size for sharing, crust is thin and crispy. Overpriced though IMO.\nAGNOLOTTI ($7): Got this after seeing it recommended in a recent article, portion is two large ravioli stuffed with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, and mortadella with a light tear-drop tomato sauce. Not sure I'd get it again necessarily but it was good to try and the pasta itself was fresh.\nCREPES ($12): From the dessert menu. Two rich Nutella crepes served with vanilla ice cream. I'm not  a dessert person, so this wasn't my pick but it was good. I'd see if they have a lighter fruit-based option instead.\n\nService was attentive, especially when it came to drink refills. Food came out fast, most prices were fairly reasonable (exceptions being the salad and pizza). They weren't busy for HH but definitely picked up around 6:30 as the dinner crowd started coming in. Note that there are several small dining rooms/nooks for a special occasion or family dinner. There's also a bathroom attendant, which I found odd. Undecided on whether I'd come back for dinner."

Let me back up for a moment so we can put this review into context: I JUST arrived home after a fun very \"Vegas-y\" trip to Vegas and despite how tired I am, I just HAD to write about my experience at Ferraro's. Yes. It was that good.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is beautiful. It is large and open with dining rooms branching off from a gorgeous and inviting bar area (which is framed by their impressive wine vault!)\n\nWe started by having a cocktail in the bar where both the drinks and the service were fantastic. \n\nWe sat and started the somewhat painful process of narrowing down our menu selections to a handful of items. Everything both on the regular menu and the specials sounded great (they even managed to make tripe sound appetizing) but we settled on a burrata with proscuitto for a started and the buccatini and mushroom risotto for our \"secondi.\" The buratta some of the best I've ever had and all three of us finished our risotto and pasta as they were both so flavorful with layers upon layers of depth of flavor. \n\nMain course was a seabass on the special menu and I fear I've run out of adjectives (be nice- I did just return from Vegas!) to describe how fantastic it was. Ethereal and perfectly cooked in texture with a light and flavorful white wine reduction. \n\nI could wax poetic about their vast wine selection for hours. Some of the bottles they have- and reasonably priced, I might add - you'd be challenged to find anywhere else in Vegas or even the western U.S. ENORMOUS Italian wine collection and the owner and staff are available and well-versed in their offerings and can guide you to the perfect selection. The only thing I'd change, and this is such a small little gripe, I'd love to see more Argentine wines on the menu as I think they could fit with the food so nicely!\n\nYes, it's off the strip- TAKE A CAB! You will want to drink enough wine to challenge the legal limit without a doubt. It's worth the journey and I doubt there will ever be another trip to Vegas, no matter how short, where I won't make a point to eat here. The place is magical in a way so few restaurants can achieve."

At 4pm it was nearly empty and the staff was so attentive and friendly. There's a ton of easy parking. The waitress explained that they get busy in peak season (Jan., convention season) but off-season and before 7:30pm it's easy seating and quick service, without losing the fine dining quality you expect from a night out.\n\nThe prices are appropriate to the fresh handmade pasta, location, quality service and atmosphere: $100 for two people with tip."

If you're looking to take out some on a fancier date...then yes. Splurge to impress. \n\nThey have a very large wine selection, and that's always a plus. \n\nWe had the cesar salad - you can definitely tell they make their own dressing. It had a fresh garlic taste and it made for tasty breath. \n\nFor dinner - \nOsso Bucco - Of course, very tender. I wasn't a fan of the sauce and I'm also not a fan of veal. My boyfriend did like it though and he did order it. If you love veal, I'm sure you'd enjoy this dish. \n\nPappardelle Mimmo - I liked this dish a lot. It wasn't overpowered by butter or oil like a lot of places do for their butter sauces. It had a very distinct smell of truffles and they also serve a large portion of lobster in the dish. They served it with two large scallops which I would have preferred it to be pan seared. They were steamed very well to where they were not chewy though. Overall - very tasty dish. \n\nThe service was good - it wasn't extraordinary. They were very good at making sure we had water/wine at all times. The server was nice a polite. I kind of noticed that this place has a lot of older people and they seem to cater more towards that crowd. The reason I say this is - there were two tables with older couples in nicer attire and they were served much quicker than we were. There was a table of four (same size party as us) that was sat about 10 minutes after us. Within 2 minutes, they were served water, bread and the drinks they ordered. We didn't even get asked about drinks other than wine until after them. \n\nThe other odd thing is, the waiter gave us our tab and we told him how we wanted it split up. He took the two cards (our tab was over $300) and then he brought it back with his 18% gratuity on there. It was not listed on there before. Not that we wouldn't have tipped him. My bf and I typically tip 20% in most cases, but that was definitely a turn off. I didn't remember seeing this anywhere, but in a nicer place like this - I think it's a bit tacky. \n\nSo I'm half and half on this place. Maybe I'll go back....maybe I won't. :)"

My party and I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation slot, but we were seated immediately anyway.\n\nAs per the norm of most Italian restaurants, warm bread was brought to the table in a basket covered with a napkin. Brought along with the fresh bread was a ramekin filled with a delicious concoction of what I believed to be olive oil, a bit of roasted garlic, and perhaps a hint of pesto. For appetizers we went with the calamari fritti (fried calamari) which was adorned with a lemon and marinara topped with red pepper flakes. Overall the calamari was mediocre, in my opinion.\n\nFor my entree I went for the Bucatini Corti all'Amatriciana. A $24 plate of thick, but hollow bucatini noodles topped with Italian bacon, onions, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I've had variations of this dish in the past but this particular one did not rank up near the top with the others. Don't get me wrong, I knew exactly what I was getting into with my order however for the price I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately, I was not. I am making a general assumption in that the dish prices are predicated upon the restaurant's proximity to the strip, and I am certain the cost of the bacon is something to take note of.\n\nThe waitstaff certainly deserved 5 stars. Friendliness, knowledge of the menu, and attentiveness were definitely their strong suits that evening. I did feel bad for the bussers who had to constantly refill the tiny water glasses in front of us, but I suppose I could've just asked for a larger glass."

You can't tell from the outside but once your in you will understand why I say romantic.\nThe bread and olive they offered were phenomenal. I ordered Agnolotti which was cooked in a delicious tomato sauce that i can't describe until you try .\nThe pizza and the crispness of the dough were amazing . The only reason I wouldn't give 5 because I was not too impressed with their appetizer that we tried  ( octopus and mozzarella cheese ) . I give excellent for the service provided by Apollo . Very impressive knowledge of the menu and the description of the plates ."

            "review": "I discovered Ferraro's by attending a Las Vegas Woman's Magazine networking event held there. They were serving these appetizers called Arancini Tartufo also known as a mouthful of heaven! Basically, they are risotto and cheese formed into balls, fried and served with a cheese dipping sauce.  Each person dining should have their own serving. That same night I ordered their Italian meas and cheese tray with olives and pepperoncinis. To die for! I wanted to go back but the opportunity never presented itself until months later when I received an email that Ferraro's was offering summer deals for locals. So I took them up on their $9.95 lunch special which included a salad and entree. I chose the house salad that was sprinkled with their house balsamic vinaigrette which was sweet and tangy at the same time and the Pollo Vesuvio with Rosemary Sauce. If I wasn't in a high class restaurant, I would have licked my plate. I instead opted for the olive rolls that were served with olive oil and herb dipping sauce to capture the remaining rosemary sauce on my plate. I was too full to partake of dessert. But I have a plan- upon my return, I will the skip lunch special and just do the same appetizer and then dessert. This place is so fantastic! You can tell it is run by a family who puts their heart and soul into every dish!. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting on? I'm pretty sure even in this economy you can afford $9.95 lunch special from 11a-4p until Sept 30 and they also have other specials for locals. Just ask your server."

I stumbled across this swanky Italian joint as there was a huge, yellow banner advertising their $9.95 lunch specials. I made a sharp right and decided to give it a shot.\n\nI had heard about this place and had basically wrote it off because I have heard how expensive their dinner menu is (that holds true and I still wouldn't ever be able to come for dinner) but that's why I was delighted when I saw a lunch banner. You can choose from 3 different pasta selections that rotate daily as well as your choice of a cup of soup or salad for $9.95. I'm in!\n\nNow did the food hold up to this Italian girl's high standards?\n\nThe answer is yes, yes, yes. I was given a bread basket to start with rolls nestled warmly in a blanket accompanied by a stained glass-like painting of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. These scrumptious little pillows held my anxious stomach at bay until my main dish arrived. Fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken....ahhh. There were ribbons of scratch-made noodles arranged perfectly on the plate with creamy, silky smooth alfredo sauce that would make even my Nona blush, all topped off with a fresh grilled rosemary chicken breast...it was Italy...home away from home, and within that moment, they had a customer for life."

The atmosphere was stuffy, as was our waiter, who felt it was more important to correct our pronunciation than to remember what we ordered.  The food was not bad, but was not up to par with the price tag.  I had the osso buco, which was okay, but it no where close to the best I've had in Vegas; the farro that accompanied it was bland and didn't pair as well as one would hope.  The appetizers and deserts were good, but didn't stand out from any other italian restaurant I've been to in the past few years.  It almost felt like they weren't even trying to impress us when we visited.\n\nMy relatively high expectations were no where close to met, and I don't foresee myself returning anytime soon."

The bread came with an excellent oil/pesto/vinegar mix. The carpaccio appetizers were wonderful. I got the house specialty Osso Buco, and the waitress was not kidding when she said no knife is required. It melted and was outstanding. I tried some of my friends' food (boar+pasta and a spinach ravioli something or other), and they were great too.... Excellent beer selection, and a wall full of wines. The wait staff were extremely attentive, knowledgable, and a lot of fun. Even if you're not staying at HRH, you should catch a quick cab from the strip and come try this place out.

I was the most disappointed in the steak. For $16, I literally received three thin slices not even large enough to make a sandwich out of. Similar to the thinly sliced lunch meat sold in stores. The smell was horrible, full of vinegar, I threw it in the trash can. I'm not sure if I was skimped by the restaurant or the delivery driver ate the most of it. The salad was mere lettuce with one large white onion chopped on top. I hate onions!! It was also a waste. I will never order from this restaurant again. When reading the ingredients, it noted that red onion were used. I didn't expect a whole onion chopped on top of it. Very disappointing."

With each of your senses tantalized, you cannot help but enjoy Ferraro's Italian Restaurant.\n\nThis family owned establishment has boasted over 25 years in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAs one of the most influential, top quality, \"Zagat Rated\", Fine Italian Restaurants in the State of Nevada (and in my opinion the U.S.A.), Ferraro's stands out from the rest.\n\nFerraro's has won many \"Best Of..\" Awards, and I am proud to say that I give them a Five Star Rating as well. To name a few of their \"Awards\", Ferraro's has been named \"Best Recommended By Michelin 2009\", as well as, \"Wine Spectators\" \"Best of Award of Excellence\" From \"Distinguished Restaurants of North America\" in 2008, and \"DiRoNa\" \"Award of Excellence\" 11 consecutive years in a row.\" Just to name a few.\n\nThe staff is professional and knowledgeable about all of the menu items. The Family always makes sure that each guest is well taken care of and happy. When you walk into Ferraro's, you get the feeling of \"home\". It's a family atmosphere, with a flair of excellence. Just by looking at the decor in this establishment you know you are in for a treat. I sometimes forget that I am in Las Vegas, Nevada and feel as though I could be right in the heart of Calabria. That is where Gino Ferraro is from. Since 1985, Gino and his Family have taken Italian Cuisine to new heights. In 2003 Gino's Son, Mimmo, took over the kitchen operations and helped transform his families recipes into the very dishes that are served to each guest. This family is not new to the restaurant business, they are just re-inventing it. Having been involved with other family restaurants, they know what to do and how to do it FIRST CLASS!\n\nHave you ever had a server come up to your table and eloquently tell you the specials of the day? Or, when your server remembers all of the menus items verbatim? It is a gift when each server has been trained so professionally. Most of the staff have been with Ferraro's since they opened, and they are considered part of the family. These are some of the small touches that make Ferraro's my favorite Fine Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas. This is a place to see and be seen. If you know good food and you're in Vegas, don't be surprised if you sit near someone famous.\n\nWhile sitting at the beautiful table in the \"Main Dining Room\" with Walter Ferraro (another important asset to the Family & Ferraro's Restaurant), overlooking the casual ambiance of the rest of the restaurant, my food was ordered and arrived. It was picture perfect. I almost didn't even want to eat it. The dishes were bold and bright with color. The portions are not too big, and can also be family style for sharing. As if I were sitting in Italy the vegetables were so brilliant. The appetizer I ordered was the, \"Carpaccio Manzo\", Thinly Sliced beef, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano, truffle oil. It was so delicious.\n\nMy second simply scrumptious dish was the, \"Salsiccia Calabrese\", Ferraro's Homemade spicy sausage grilled, served with crispy polenta, and roasted peppers. As well as, the Imported FRESH Mozzarella.\n\nDid I mention that Ferraro's has the best Homemade Pasta and Pizza to order? It's the real deal! This is what you would order if you were someplace in the middle of Italy.\n\nAs I took a bite of my, \"Agnolotti\", Ravioli filled spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce, I was enjoying every minute.\n\nOn to my last course (before dessert). \"The Ferraro's House Speciality\", Osso Buco and Baby Lamb Chops. One word for both, OUTSTANDING!\n\nThe \"Osso Buco\" fell off of the bone and it was so perfectly cooked I was in heaven. If you love \"Osso Buco\", you should not be reading my review right now. You should be on a plane or in your car on your way to \"Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar\".\n\nIf you're a \"Wine Enthusiast\", the selection of wine at Ferraro's is one of the most notorious around. Ask, Joe Pike, the Sommelier to accommodate you. He is happy to help you find the best selection. Ask to see the wine cellar, if you're into that. It is phenomenal.\n\nFor those VIP guests, Ferraro's also offers private wine lockers for your special selections.\n\nFor dessert, my two favorites are the, \"Authentic Homemade Cannoli\", Trio tower of cannoli filled with smooth ricotta, sugar & cinnamon, with chocolate & raspberry sauces, and the, \"Tiramisu\", a Ferraro's favorite...classic Italian dessert made with lady fingers, Mascarpone cheese & espresso, also homemade.\n\nFerraro's Wine Bar is absolutely gorgeous. The bar area wraps around from the inside of the dining room to the \"one of a kind\" outside patio. The Patio is well decorated, simply classic, like a summer Italian Garden. Probably one of my favorite spots to sip on a glass of vino and relax.\n\nAs a \"Food Critic\" I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ferraro's."

We were not only greeted by the owner Gino, but son Mimmo came out with each course and talked us through each dish. Even his nephew came by for a visit. It was that same hospitality and attention to detail that left me in complete awe in what I just experience.\nGino came by as we sat and asked if he could do a prepared menu special for us with a different wine pairing for each dish. Without hesitation we both agreed and began our culinary journey through Italy. He left us by saying \"you know this is the best Italian restaurant in the world right?\"\nNow, as you may already know, I'm not a foodie...and I'm the furthest thing from a Sommelier. I know enough about wine to know reds go with beef and whites go with pork and seafood. Gino knew everything. He has a cellar filled with the best and top wines from the old country. Nothing comes into his restaurant without his approval. He's visited all the vineyards so who am I to question this. He's also certified to do so and has the sophisticated palate to provide these choice selections with the dishes his son pairs to go with.\nI would also like to add that all the seafood and meats in Mimmo's kitchen are 100% non-steroid/hormone, grass fed and Safe Harbor Certified Seafood guaranteed to be on you plate in less than 36 hours from being pulled from the ocean. It doesn't stop there because even the pasta, breads and dessert are all made in house, your choice, gluten free, and whole wheat. Impressive right? Incredible. The fact that I hadn't heard of this place until today left me feeling a little disappointed in myself.\nI left here with a new appreciation for Italian food. I've been to Italy; I've dined at the high-end Italian strip restaurants and Ferraro's made them all look stupid. This place gave me one of the best meals of my life (and I've had way to many good meals to count). It is truly a family affair. In fact, Olive Garden should be sued because when you're at ferraro's, you really are family and they will never steer you wrong."

The tangy-ness of the vinegar provided the perfect balance to the almonds. Great salad (got it again for lunch today )! Think of it as a wedge salad with butter lettuce. My dinner entree during first visit was the pappardelle mimmo. Pasta cooked well, large chunks of lobster meat throughout and big hunks of scallops. The truffles added a nice smoky richness. Awesome! I had the gnocchi bolognese for lunch today. Melt in your mouth goodness! Literally!  I liked the way the gnocchi stuck to the roof of my mouth. Meat sauce not too red and tomato-y, just the right balance of meat. Subtle, rich flavors! Everything was great! I have to knock a star because bread was not warm.

Having grown up in an Italian family, this is the only restaurant in Las Vegas that serves the kind of homemade dishes that my parents and grandparents made for dinner, especially on Sundays. The pasta is homemade and all the sauces are made from scratch. The vibe you get from the entire staff makes it obvious that Ferraro's is a family run business from the minute you walk through the door to the end of dinner. It is not like in the casinos where everything is so corporate and robotic. My opinion comes from 25 years working in the restaurant business (most of which I spent in the kitchen) and from my 100% Italian ancestry."

I had veal scaloppine which was again a small portion and again had no flavor from the sauce. The veggie that came with it was awful. Service was outstanding as was the atmosphere. \n\nThis place is an enigma as to why it has such a large following with average store bought Italian food level quality??? As hilarious as it sounds Olive Garden has better food?

Topping it off, we shared the recommended Tiramasu."

When booking, I received a text msg with all of the details so I showed that to the hostess and they honored the reservation. I was a little bummed because I made a note online that we were celebrating my husbands birthday and I guess they didn't see that either so nothing was done. The restaurant itself is pretty, and the live music is a nice touch. The service was also pretty good, but the food was only so-so. My husband had the filet and he said it didn't have much flavor. He said the same about the roasted potatoes it was served with. I had the seafood pappardelle. There was a good amount of lobster and scallops but my lobster was over cooked and the pasta was a bit chewy. The sauce and scallops were good but again, nothing spectacular. We also had 2 cocktails that were very sweet. It wasn't a horrible experience but it also wasn't memorable. I'd much rather go to Del Frisco's for steak or Giada's for Italian."

Our friends stop here every time they are in Vegas so it says a lot about this place.\n\nThis place is amazing to say the least! Gianni was our server and he made our experience even better! He had good recommendations for dinner options and when some of us wanted the gnocchi as an appetizer instead of the meal portion he easily made it happen. Gianni knows the menu very well and the way he describes each dish is amazing. You can tell he loves to eat too! \n\nOn to the food! \nGnocchi- one of the best gnocchis I have ever had. This is a must order whether you get an appetizer portion or as your dinner entree. It just melts in your mouth. The sauce is a light tomato sauce with basil which was perfectly seasoned. Get it!! (One person at our table got it with the bologna sauce instead. Fabulous in its own way!)\n\nOctopus appetizer- This was one of their special appetizers of the night. It came prepared like a salad with really good olive oil, olives, fried capers and some herbs. Amazing dish, perfectly tender octopus. Simple to bring out the flavors of the dish. \n\nBranzino-yummmm, this Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and seasoned lightly. Underneath was a sweet potato puree and on the sides were mushrooms cooked alongside figs. First time having it that way and it was a delicious combo. This was a very well prepared Branzino!\n\nSeafood tagliatelle-again the seafood was cooked perfectly. You could taste it's freshness in the dish. You see a pattern here at this place, it's all good! \n\nVeal parmigiano- This dish came out prepared slightly different because Gianni said the octopus and following with this dish could crash the palate. So he had it prepared fried then a fresh tomato, arugula and truffle on top. Amazing!! So glad they love their food so much they recommend different ways to get it.\n\nSo for dessert, we wanted the crepes and a pistachio cream dessert, but couldn't decide. But guess what, no problem because Gianni will make it happen. He had them make a dessert sampler for us with those two options. Everything came plated separately for each of us like a sampler. You learn quickly that at Ferraros they make it happen. Or should I say Gianni can make it happen. Please ask for him to be your server, he will make your experience even better.\n\nHere's a cool tidbit, Gianni also plays the drums in the band. So he take care of you and in between he plays drums. This place is so cool. We have now also decided we are going to stop here every time we are in Vegas. They really make you feel special here. \n\nThank you Ferraros and thank you Gianni Montreal!"

Joaquin was a consummate host - asking if we had any food allergies or food we didn't like - and then brought out an excellent sampling of 4 dishes to choose from. So difficult, as everything was prepared so well.  Reminds me of the fancier italian places we used to go to in NYC that had creative menus. The owner came out and thanked us for coming - asking if there was anything he could do. Other than make by stomach larger so that I could eat even more, there wasn't. A little pricey - but the service and quality of food highly justifies it. Looking forward to returning during my next Vegas trip."

We were waited on by Apollo who made sure we felt like more than just another set of customers, he made us feel like friends, and took excellent care of us throughout the entire night. He answered any and all questions, made personal suggestions on the food, which I trusted and tried something new, and was blown away by the choice. Incredible! I had the CASERECCE, and my fiance had the SPAGHETTINI AGLIO E OLIO, both of which were delicious. The bread was so savory with the olive oil, vinegar and what tasted like a garlic pesto. I had an unforgettable experience and want to thank Apollo again for taking such great care of us, he is a rarity in the service industry and this place is very fortunate to have such a warm, kind man on their staff. Well done all around. We will definitely be back soon."

If you come when it's not 100F in Vegas, I highly recommend getting a table in the patio, especially if you're on a date ;) Your date will be impressed.\n\nThis is a family owned place, real Italians. Chef Mimmo is a great cook, and he always comes out to the dining room to check on everyone. His brother Walter is the best PR in town, he practically knows everyone and he's always happy to make your Vegas stay more enjoyable and memorable. Joaquin is our favorite server, he knows the menu top to bottom and he always has a couple recommendations off the menu that will knock your socks off. \n\nAs far as the food goes, I don't know where to start... My all time favorite is the ribeye, which is actually not on the menu, and is not always available... That piece of meat is better than any steak you will have at any of the top steakhouses, word. The pappardelle Mimmo are also to die for if you are a seafood lover. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I go to Vegas 3-4 times a year and we always have at least one meal at Ferraro's.

It is just a little stuffy, but this environment definitely serves a purpose. For example, this is a perfect restaurant for your parents from out of town or for a first date, especially a blind date, or for some men in suits. There is nothing offensive, edgy or loud about the experience. \n\nThey actually have happy hour specials on drinks, but we arrived past 7pm--too late for deals. The cheapest glass by the wine is around $12, but they also serve wines in \"tasting\" volumes, i.e. one ounce and five ounces.  \n\nMy buddy and I sat in the bar area, which I like. The high-top tables are comfortable, and there is entertainment. They actually have a stage, and when we were there, there was a pianist singing some standard piano songs. I am not a fan of this live music genre, but it does enliven the atmosphere. I think on Friday and Saturday nights they are going to start having a DJ, which could be worth catching. They even have a special late night \"tapas\" menu from 10pm-2am. \n\nI must say given the current state of breadbaskets, the goods here were above average. The bread was warm, fresh and served with some lovely oil, vinegar and pesto. I had the fettuccine pomodoro with ricotta. The pasta is fresh, and I really enjoyed the texture and thickness. The noodles themselves were well executed, and the flavors were unfussy, but delicious. \n\nI am probably in a minority, but I have a hard time spending $19 on a pasta dish, especially when there is no meat. Thus, I am torn. I think the food is tasty. The atmosphere is acceptable, but the prices are a tad high. I am going to go ahead and give it four stars because I think it definitely serves a purpose well, but the next time I want noodles, I will more than likely head to Spring Mountain Road (aka Chinatown)!"

The wine list is extensive and includes some high-priced wines, so it's best if you have a fairly good idea of what you enjoy.  Although the prices are higher than average, it is still a good value.  I've paid more for an Italian meal on the strip that's just so-so.  I saw couples, business people and family celebrations."

            "review": "After a round of golf full of good times and few good shots it was off to Ferraro's to meet friends for dinner. The last time I had been to Ferraro's it was at the old location and Steve and Edie were at their seats at the bar, so many moons ago. We were seated in the bar area so we could watch the games. It was not an overly busy night in the restaurant and service was good. We ordered the stuffed peppers, tripe, osso buco, spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, rabbit, veal milanese, a special pasta that was supposedly excellent (friend liked it so much he was unwilling to share).  I'm sure I left something out but all in all the meal was fine. The standout for me was the tripe. It was absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly with tremendous flavor (maybe a littler hotter and spicier would have made it best ever), so much so we ordered another with dinner. The specialties were where they fell a bit flat. The osso buco was fairly bland and the meat a bit stringy, almost as if they did not have the best quality meat and not braised long enough. Not bad, just not great and far from a specialty. The same could be said of the rabbit. Fairly bland and unremarkable. All in all it was a very enjoyable evening with friends.  Just not sure I will be rushing back on my next trip."

            "review": "This review is late but definitely needed.\n\nLet me start be saying I adore Ferraros- the food and staff have always been awesome. Until this visit for the 30th anniversary...\n\nSuper deal on a 4 course meal- $30 and change! Awesome!\n\nCalled to make a reservation ahead of time letting them know we wanted to do the happy hour and the anniversary special and would like to be seated accordingly- the gal who took the reservation said no problem.\n\nChecked in for the res the night of and they put our table on the dining side where you can't order from the happy hour menu. Talked to the hostess about the reservation and she said it'd be a 20 min wait. At this point, fine. We'll just wait at the bar until they figure this out.\n\nA friend had a $100 gift card and bought our first round of drinks! Awesome! Well by the time she was able to order, they had the table ready for us. So half of us never got our drinks. Bartender did acknowledge that he owed us our drinks. Problem is, the drinks never came.\n\nWell, neither did a server. The bussers were quick to bring water and bread which was nice. But we waited 20 minutes and no one came to give us menus or help us. I went to the hostess letting her know that no one has helped us, she said she would get someone. 10 more minutes passed and I had to stop someone to help us. He gave us menus & took our app orders and never came back. 15 more minutes passed and we had to wave another person down because we had no food & no drinks and were ready to order our entrees and beverages....and the guy who initially helped us was nowhere to be found. Add insult to injury, from the moment we were sat, there were a number of servers who just passed us by without checking on us. Even the table next to us was being helped. That's unacceptable.\n\nFinally we got a female server to be our \"regular\" server. Explained about the drink situation and she said she'd get those for us. She was nice but still didn't really check on our table. One of my friends had to search for her for the check as we were just sitting around waiting for quite some time, long after all the plates were cleared and the glasses were dry (including water).\n\nWhen we got the bill, they charged us full price for everything AND charged us for drinks that we had already paid for at the bar. One of the staff was trying to explain to my friend that they can't honor the anniversary price since she was using a coupon. But she wasn't using a coupon, it was a gift card. They came back with a somewhat corrected bill and told my friend that they took off certain drinks since she used her \"discount\" on it at the bar. DISCOUNT?! Since when is full tender in which you use to pay for services a DISCOUNT?! It's not.\n\nNot to mention our reservation was for 5:45pm and we didn't walk out until 9:40pm. \n\nAs much as I loved this place, this experience created such a foul taste that I don't think I'll be able to give it another chance for quite some time.\n\nAdditionally, they have a \"rewards\" program that doesn't work. The average I've spent on visits here has been $150+ and I'd come several times a month, sometimes several times a week and not once has a reward come through. So if you see the paper in your bill to sign up, there's no point in wasting your time with it."

Why not venture out to a quiet off the strip restaurant that is worth every penny!\n\nKey Reasons to go -\n\nRomantic and cozy ambience\nOut of the hustle and bustle\nPrivate lot to park in\nNice bar area\nWelcoming hosts and waitstaff\nDecent wine selection\nFriendly and attentive service\nModern & clean restrooms\nDelicious food\n\nThe highlight of the night and the reason to return, is Ferraro's fall of the bone and melt in your mouth Osso Buco. They compliment it with the creamiest most delish risotto on the side. To die for!!!!!!! After a yummy salad there is hardly any room for desert unless you take it to go.  \n\nMy husband tried the house lasagna. Now let me preface this by telling you that ALL lasagna dishes at restaurants have stiff competition to overcome. My mother-in-law's amazing sauce takes 2 days to make. When you combine that with real fall off the bone meat and layers of various cheeses and fresh pasta you have the most incredible flavor sensations in every bite.  Honestly, it's hard for restaurants to even compete.\n\nHaving said all that it was decent lasagna, but I think he was jealous of my Osso Buco and it was just too good to share more than a bite or two! he he he\n\nWe most def will be back the next time we are in Vegas and craving some authentic Italian food."

We are a group of about 10 people, potentially interested into bringing business to this restaurant, with our professional network and on a private plan.\nWell, this is NOT going to happen!\nThey offered us a nice table to sit at. We placed our food and drinks order. Then the waiter came back to us saying we had to leave because this was kind of a high-end table, and each of us would have to spend at least $200 if we wanted to stay there.\nLet's have a quick maths lesson here: 10 people, $200 each. That makes $2,000 during a supposed happy hour time. Plus the place was empty, nobody was waiting for this table.\nAnyway, $2,000. Now, let's have the ten of us coming back... Let's say at least 5 times a year, to be fair. With at least 2 other people each time. With an average ticket of about $75 per person. $11,250.\nDear manager, you just lost at least $9,250 within 15 minutes.\nPlus a very bad opinion from the 10 of us, and we are going to spread the word, I swear.\nThis is a perfect example of bad marketing and management. Congratulations!"

After sitting down and getting a glass of wine (so I was committed) I found out the pizzas are \"only at happy hour.\" Nothing else on the menu looked good so I had an appetizer with what I'm pretty sure was undercooked sausage. Oh, and there was a cheesy lounge singer. Very disappointed. Usually Yelp is dependable. Not this time."
