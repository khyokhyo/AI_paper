It's happens to me three times now so I don't know why I'm surprised but I ordered egg whites and sausage and also protein pancakes. Turkey sausage was raw and like jello when I chewed it so I immediately spit it out and go to eat the pancakes and they are still batter inside. Smh. Like I said last time I ever eat here."

Most juices and smoothies have a fair amount of sweetness although most of the staff is open to slight adjustments to the recipe. The most vegetable based juice is V9, it's great though. Juices are made with a Vitamix. Restaurant has a laid back atmosphere.  You order your food at the counter and wait for your food at the table. Free wifi. Bright green decor makes me happy. Can order ahead, but don't call too far in advance, a juice sitting around too long thickens."

I love this place for all the healthy items they serve, so I was surprised on my last visit that I never wrote one. \n\nLet me start by saying that they offer $1 off juices and smoothies with Yelp check in! My go-to drink would be their Wellness Drink. It contains green grapes, green apples, pineapples, oranges, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed and agave. Sounds like a salad gone wrong, but it's delicious. Its sweet, so you don't get the overpowering vegetable taste. Just remember to keep stirring it so you don't get a thick sludge at the end. It's an awesome meal replacement or a post workout drink. \n\nTheir food is just as healthy as their drinks. Nothing is processed and everything is made to order. I like their tofu fries (light on the seasoning) and their margherita pizza as well. They have burgers and wraps, with the options of whole wheat buns or spinach tortillas as substitutions. They also offer unique items like bison or ostrich patties for your burgers. The prices are a little higher here, but you have to remember that eating healthy doesn't come cheap. You do get high quality ingredients and friendly helpful service. So I think it's so worth the price."

You can build your own meals and learned if you're being carb free they had these \"HCG\" meals?  Very convenient.  \n\nVery timely with you're pick up orders, friendly staff, clean restaurants.

            "review": "It's been a while since my first visit, but the food was still just as great during my second visit. I like the healthy eating options, the large menu, and simplicity. \n\nTurkey Club ($9.99): Sliced turkey, turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and Russian dressing on a whole wheat hoagie. Added sweet potato fries for $1.50. Decent sandwich, however, not a lot of flavor. I added some S+P and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) and it improved significantly. Sweet potato fries were good.\n\nBison Burger ($10.99): Grilled Bison burger, vegan cheese, and LTO on a whole wheat bun. Side of tofu fries. I believe they use Daiya vegan cheese, which I loooove! Plus, it's available at no extra charge! Again, very little flavor as you need to add your own condiments and seasoning, but you can do it to your liking. This was delicious! The patty was tender and cooked just the way I wanted (medium rare). Plus, the tofu fries are awesome! \n\nExtra Lean Certified Angus Beef Burger ($9.99): This is also grilled and accompanied by LTO. I added avocado and chose lettuce bibb for a low-carb option. Another great burger!\n\nThe best part of their menu are all the choices and options. I was delighted that they have a vegan cheese option for burgers at no additional cost. The burgers, sandwiches, and wraps can be paired with whole wheat buns/hoagies/wraps, spinach wraps, and protein-style options like Bibb lettuce or cooked cabbage. Everything is so customizable and they have so many options to fit several diet needs. There is also a build-your-own-meal section."

            "review": "The concept excited me. Healthier, lower calorie vegan//vegetarian options served alongside healthier, lower calorie meaty options - a place I could go with my meat-eater friends and not feel jipped. \n\nThe above concept is really all that was exciting for me at Greens and Protein. Unfortunately, the food was rather bland. \n\nI ordered the plate with tofu (protein), asparagus (green) and quinoa. The quinoa tasted literally like quinoa. No seasoning, nothing. Likewise, the asparagus failed to incite even a slight quiver in my taste buds. The tofu was passable - but I'll eat tofu made any way. \n\nMy husband ordered the raw mock chicken lettuce cups. I actually found this dish offensive and puny in serving size. But my husband liked it. \n\nOne of my friends ordered the bison burger which he relished and the other one, a similar plate like mine but with a grilled portobello mushroom instead of quinoa. The mushroom was actually very good. \n\nWe shared the tofu fries - quite good but I really wish they weren't fried. What's the point of a healthy meal? \n\nThe drinks were ridiculously priced so I refused to have any. \n\nAll in all...nice concept, progressive for Vegas and a place you could hang if you were on a strict caloric diet. But being satisfied with your meal...that's another story."

But this isn't a review about whole foods is it? I always think these health food places are just a fad, I reference that specific store because they are known for fresh deliciousness, I visit it from time to time, buying $15 juiced items when I feel like I want to support John Mackey and Rene Lawson Hardy. I love the movement of natural produce, I don't love the prices though, but let me just say Proteins and Greens surprised me, I honestly thought I would have I regret my purchase but I was fine! No buyers remorse!\nFirst of all big shoutout to the cashier for so pleasantly manning the line, the situation was heavily trafficked and she did it effortlessly! She prescribed the right thing for me to try and now I fell in love with this lil gem of a healthy dine spot.\nBison cheesesteak and tofu fries. Let me just say I hate tofu (except one specific dish that my friends mother makes)... These fries will change your tofu-hating life. DELICIOUS.\nOk.

Done talking. \n\n'Twas a spectacular first for me.\n\n4 star, it is a little pricey- If I'm already spending that I expect all organic.\nPlus side: Whole Foods juiced drinks you get a tall for like what? 12 bucks\nHere you're getting a Venti for 7.50"

I ordered a burger with jicama fries and my husband ordered a wrap with tofu fries. Before coming here, we heard such great reviews of this place. To be completely honest, I wasn't really impressed. The food lacked flavor to me. My husband enjoyed it because he felt it was a healthy meal compared to the stuff we usually eat. I told him that healthy food can also taste good. He recently went back and had a turkey burger and said it tasted dry. There is a place a couple blocks from here called Elixer Organic Cafe that I think is much tastier. I might consider returning here to try something different one day before completely ruling it out."

The main reason got bumped up to five star! I have been the other location on my side of town. Wow! The food am sure just as good (on this visit only came in for recovery smoothie aka went with Green Leaf Berry Blast) as the other location. I have always been fan of with the healthy choices. The prices can be pricey but in this case your getting the quality you pay for and they have nice diversity of options. The WOW factor for me. The interior design was SOOOOO much more pleasant then the other location. Maybe its because I believe this is the mother ship or the first one in Vegas. So the interior design is totally pimped out with personality and makes you want too come back rather then the bland blah interior of the other location. Here so many things that stands out soon as walked in. The fake waterfall coming down on the wall, the green chairs, couple wide screens places next to the waterfalls, and everywhere look love the interior design. The fountain area with the cucumber water dispenser adds nice touch then your normal fountain station area. The customer service is fabulous. I jus wished they could have flip flop the interior design to the one closer my side of town then I would be duke. Lol!"

Feels like an extension of LVAC and I'm the only lazy bum who didn't work up a sweat prior to coming here lol.  The decor is modern yet feels green and nature-inspired.  I really like the look of this place.  \n\nI paid an arm and a leg for my Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie (note: 1 dollar off for checking in) and I almost had buyer's remorse as I waited in line.  The line moved quickly enough and service was friendly but, hot damn, it took FOREVER to get my smoothie.  It's the only thing I ordered - no food, just a smoothie to go.  And I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  \n\nFinally my name was called and I thought for sure this was going to be an out-of-this-world smoothie experience.  All the hype, all the waiting, all that cash I forked over... built up to this moment.  I try the smoothie and I'm all, \"eh\".  Oh the sweet sting of health-food disappointment. \n\nI give it 3 stars because I like the concept and the decor, the service was good, and there are quite a few things on the menu I really want to try (pizza, wraps, etc.), so I'm sure I'll be back to update this."

The burger was good..decent. The fries were a nice healthy alternative and not too bad themselves. I started w an Apple pie smoothie....expecting the flavor God's to swoop me up to food heaven....but yeah NO! It was flavorless....a huge disappointment after the big intro given by the cashier. Not sure what it needs, but it was missing \"something\".  Service was good, staff very helpful w questions. Overall it was a satisfying meal....all vegan, no soy and no added sugar....AWESOME!!

I came here again after a workout session at the LVAC less than 100 yards away and it was busy as usual.  I'm glad the drink making station is immediately to the left when you walk in because they can make your drink while you wait in line.  I ordered the Wellness again, it's my personal favorite but you can't really go wrong with any of the drinks they have here.  \n\nProtip!:  A Yelp check in on your smart phone gives you $1 off towards a smoothie!  Every bit helps since the prices are high, but if you're a health nut then you'll know eating healthy is costly regardless.\n\nFor my protien I wanted the Ostrich but they were out of it this time so I settled for the Bison Burger without cheese.  They're both really good burgers and trying to find real Ostrich or Bison meat is difficult in Las Vegas, much less already prepared and ready to eat.  The tofu fries is really unique and good too!"

I brought a friend with me so I could get a second opinion. I made the mistake of ordering the same chicken wrap, thinking it would be better the second time around. Nope. My friend had the Bison wrap and loved it. I hesitated to update my review because I still wasn't impressed by the food, but didn't want to post a negative review when I knowingly ordered something I didn't like the first time around and my friend loved his wrap. But seriously, if you're healthy food joint and can't make a good grilled chicken wrap... what can I say?  I tried it again one more time and had the turkey burger, which while it needed some salt - was much better than the chicken wrap. The tomatoes were a way overripe ... but it wasn't bad as a whole. I still love the idea of the jicama fries, but they could really do something to make them tastier, like a citrus dressing option or something.. anything. LOL. All in all, I might eat here on occasion - but for what it is I think it's way overpriced. I spent $17+ today for the burger and a juice drink. Definitely not affordable or good enough for a daily lunch option. The place is busy, busy though... so it doesn't look like they're hurting for business."

The last time we were here we ordered the \"Green Shake\"; \"Green Ginger Limeade\" and the \"Albacore Tuna Salad\"\n\nThe \"Green Shake\" comes with Banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Sounds like they put the kitchen sink in this shake but you can taste hints of every ingredient. You get a dose of fruits and vegetables and an added extra protein burst with the almonds. You can substitute this for a meal as it's very filling. \n\nThe \"Green Ginger Limeade\" comes with Green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, agave nectar. Its a very refreshing drink and its not filled with a bunch of sugars. One of the things I love about this drink is the ginger. It does not overpower the drink as it adds a unique sweetness. \n\nThe \"Albacore Tuna Salad\" comes with Tomatoes, celery, cucumbers and bibb lettuce, Dijon dressing. Now this was such a big disappointment. My thoughts ordering this was I was going to get seared tuna on top of greens but to my surprise it was canned tuna and the large size was priced at 9.99. I felt like I just got ripped off. The dressing was also a little too strong with the Dijon but at least it killed the taste of the canned tuna. \n\nI would definitely come back for the Juices and Smoothies but would hesitate to order another salad. There are other selections available on the menu like pizzas and burgers that I might try next time."

The Bison was cooked well, soft and great comparison with the cheese and spinach wrap. A great filling and healthy option. The Tofu fries were a bit lacking in flavor and had an oily/greasy taste. The decor is well green and very natural and outdoorsy. Very relaxing and Zen ambience! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."

Their tofu home fries convinced me that tofu wasn't as evil as I have previously experienced!\n\nThe service is what I would compare to a Panera or other sit down/fast food place. You walk in, order at the counter, they give you a number to set at your table, then they bring you you meal. \n\nService was fast & friendly and the staff was friendly and knew their stuff despite looking young (must be all that healthy food!). They don't do delivery, but you can call ahead and then pick up your order. \n\nThe food was clean, healthy and they had plenty of Gluten Free options (bread & pizza crust) to choose from and their was no guilty aftertaste!"

Perfect for breakfast, lunch or and early dinner. The juices and smoothies are fantastic as well. Made from scratch right in front of you from whole fruits and veggies.\n\nVeggie Flatbread: Really tasty. They use unconventional veggies that normal wouldn't be on a veggie pizza. Artichoke hearts, Greek and black olives, spinach, orange bell peppers and classic red onions.  \n\nBuffalo Chicken Flatbread: Right up my man's alley. Although there isn't a ton of buffalo sauce flavor, it's more of a BBQ chicken pizza, it's still scrumptious. Make sure you ask for ranch. It's a Greek yogurt ranch but it's so good. And guilt-free. \n\nGinger Limeade Juice: I get this every time I go there. It's so light and refreshing. And a green drink so who can complain?  \n\nI'll be frequenting this place often and definitely adding to my review with different menu items. Also I'd like to add that the restaurant was super accommodating to my dog on the patio. They gave him water in a cup and everything. So nice!"

            "review": "Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\n\nYou're a wise man or woman, if you read some of the reviews of Greens and Proteins before trying them out.  You'll find a mix of \"I've experienced better\", \"A-Ok\", and \"As good as it gets\".  The most common issue...the sticker shock.  Yup, Greens and Proteins is on the Richie Rich side for what you get in quantity.  Smoothies over $10 (not lying), sandwiches over $12 (no five-dollar foot long here), and even their burgers are pricey starting around $10 (Where's the beef?).  I read the reviews and was armed with knowledge before I step foot in here. So, why the 5 Stars from me?   It comes to down to what I think Greens and Proteins was trying to accomplish, eating on the healthier side.  One thing about eating healthier, it sure cost more and I knew that coming in.  5 Stars because I expected less and got more.  \n\nI came here for their Proteins, not the Greens, and decided on the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\".  This is a 4 Step process, but I only chose Step 1, which was protein only.   You have a choice of Filet Mignon ($17), Bison ($13), Chicken ($10), Turkey ($9), Salmon ($13), and even my favorite lean meat Ostrich ($17).  I got the salmon and they knocked a few bucks off the price because I didn't get anything else with it.  The salmon is about 6 oz and to be honest, it was a little bland.  I solved this by adding a little Teriyaki sauce to it.  Voila! Problem solved. \n\nAs for the restaurant and ambiance, it's just okay.  You get a mix of your Average Joes, Fitness Freaks, and New Year Resolutioners.  My favorite is the guy wearing a tank top, beanie, and sunglasses.  Guess this guy is just confused whether it's hot ,cold, or sunny inside.  Or, he's just too cool for the rest of us.  The wait is little longer than expected and since the restaurant is also small, it gets a little loud and crowded.\n\nOverall, I am a fan and think Greens and Protein is as good as it gets.  If you're looking for something quick, cheap, and tasty, then Greens and Proteins may not be for you.  If you're looking for something clean, healthier, and don't mind spending a little more, then Greens and Proteins is perfect."

I was craving something different so decided to check out Greens and Proteins because I had remembered seeing it on Yelp.\n\nUmmm... gurrrrl puhleeze. These prices are insanity. There isn't a drink out there that should cost $7+ unless it comes in a solid gold cup. I spent a long time looking over the menu because my family juices a LOT and many of the drinks were things we make at home already, but 5x the price. \n\nThe staff was friendly, but I honestly couldn't make up my mind. I settled on the V9, but was a little curious as to why the girl making the drink was using jarred vegetable base, not stock, in the drink. When I asked the girls behind the counter  about the base, they said they didn't know anything about it and just held up the jar for me to see. Flavor bases, pork, chicken, beef and vegetable bases are chock full of partially hydrogenated soybean oil (transfat) and hydrolyzed soy protein (MSG). No bueno. The vegetable base had a Top Ramen flavor packet flavor in the drink.\n\nI was disappointed that the drink was so pricey and I don't have the guts to walk out of a place after I'm there, especially after the staff was friendly. I took a drink of the V9, and was even more disappointed - the flavor and the temperature was not a good combination. Ice cold salty ramen flavor mixed with wheat grass and dried tomato seeds was what I first noticed. I couldn't drink any more of it but thought if I took it home and heated it up, it might make a nice soup. I ended up giving it to my dad, who juices vegetables 3x a day, and he told me not to buy that drink again. He said the cabbage was giving the drink a strange flavor.\n\nAs a dietetics student at UNLV, I would love to see this place get rid of the agave syrup (it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, so it's even MORE unhealthy!) As well, I'd love to see them scrap the unfermented soy bean products - that stuff is so toxic and causes so many adverse health problems, specifically in the thyroid and reproductive organs, that it has no business in an establishment that prides itself on being \"healthy.\" (If these things were gone, I would raise my star rating.)\n\nI'd love to see their raw offerings on the menu (it was a line I noticed after I ordered) and to see their drink prices decrease by 2 dollars. Even though they may be a better alternative to Jamba Juice, it really says something when Jamba Juice is considered the affordable alternative. I was sad when I checked in, AFTER to paying, that there was a dollar off coupon for drinks. Agh! frustrating. \n\nThe place is pretty and the staff is nice, but the restaurant was empty. As long as the prices are as high as they are, I can't see this being any place other than a splurge treat. I may try this place out again, but I wouldn't reorder the V9."

But once a week I'll have a cheat meal and that's where Greens and Proteins comes in to play. \n\nI've only been here twice, and i have yet steered away from the Ginger Limeade Juice: Green Grapes, Spinach, Ginger, Lime, Agave Nectar, and blended with ice.  Sounds iffy, but trust me it is amazing.  \n\nI tried the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap and the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap on two separate visit and they're both freakin' amazing. I love how the Teriyaki Sauce on their Wrap was not overly too sweet nor thick.  Perfect to my liking without the feeling of going over the edge since I'm sensitive to sugary taste.\n\nThe Bison Cheese Steak is probably my favorite Cheese Steak, ever!  The meat was juicy and loaded with big flavor.  Tossed with onions, red peppers, and low fat mozzarella cheese.  This one truly hit the spot and reset all my cravings for the week.\n\nYou choose Wheat or Spinach for the wrap, and also Tofu Fries or Spicy Jicama Slices for the sides.  The spice level of the Jicama is just enough to tickle your taste buds.  Great fillers.  Tofu Fries are lightly bread, baked, and served with their Russian Sauce (Low Fat Mayo, Ketchup, and Relish).\n\nOnly small gripe is that i wish the portion was just a tad bit smaller.  I have no self control when food is placed in front of me and usually end up finishing it all.   #firstworldproblems.\n\nService is impeccable and restaurant is super clean and spacious.  I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their menu."

Greens and Proteins was the perfect afternoon snack/meal for my in between spa, errands, and gym session. \n\nIt would make sense that this health conscience business would be located in front of the LVAC. The  feel of the establishment is open and chill. The waterfall fountain and plants mounted to the wall gives the place some life.\n\nNow, on to the food. I heard about this healthy pizza notion through a past Yelp event. Curious whether a good pizza could be delicious and low calorie, I stopped in for lunch. Although nothing struck my fancy at first, I ordered the Greek Pizza ($8.99) and sat down to wait for my food. I asked for a cup for water since I saw they had infused water for guests. A faint taste of cucumbers and lemon was refreshing after sweating it out in a hotbed. When my food came out, I was doubting my decision. The crust looked cracker like. After a bite, it was not a disappointment. The thin slices of cucumbers contrasted well with the tomatoes. While the feta and kalamata olives gave bold flavors to an otherwise mellow pie. My pizza was less than 400 calories and satisfying. Instead of leaving here stuffed, it was a nice change of pace. For those lighter days, I would suggest G&P. If I was ravenous, it would probably be a different story."

I have to say they were both pretty darn delicious. \n\nI couldn't imagine a cheese steak wrap, let alone a bison, but once I took a bite...mmmmm was all that I hummed.  I have to say, as a wrap I couldn't even eat everything.  As a matter if fact I saved the other half for dinner.  I could not decide between the tofu fries or the jicama fries so I was able to go half half.  They both were good, but I did favor the tofu fries.  I think I might order that as a side by itself too.\n\nThis seems to be a pretty bust place, the whole time we were there, there was always a line. But it moves quick.  The servers, if you dine in, are quick and pleasant when serving and taking away your plates.  \n\nI'm pretty excited that I tried this place out because I'm coming back to try even more things.  I'm going to also try some of those yummy smoothies I kept seeing everyone order.  \n\nYippie for greens and proteins!"

Everything you need is here if you're trying to slim down, following Paleo, like eating healthy, or are in to getting more than just the typical bland smoothie. The setup is clean, the service is nothing short of excellent and I will definitely be going back. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because the portion sizes are always inconsistent. One visit I'll get a perfectly sized chicken breast or bison meat, the next time the meat is barely enough to qualify as a snack for a five year old at recess. Some type of uniformity here so I know whether to order extra meat or not would help.\n\nRegardless, the shakes are good and the food is delicious.  And the place is really a 4.5 it's just that this place has to be scored on a scale. When I eat at some places I think wow this food is amazing because A) the process to make was long and complex so I needed someone else to just make it B) it would be hard to find those ingredients to make it or C) it's something new that I have no idea how to make. This place doesn't apply to either of those criteria, its basic and you can make it yourself if you have the time and its going to taste exactly how you think its going to taste. (Chicken, asparagus and couscous - there's no surprise here you know what it's going to taste like but hey its good and if you want to stray away from basic the wraps and hamburger will do the trick). BUT this is not a knock on the place because I will be here every week attempting to counter the fried cheese bacon dough thingamajig I will probably have every weekend. And their juices and smoothies are actually different from what you'll find around town and actually have me feeling better after I down one so even if you hate eating healthy, their juice and smoothies are still worth the trip."

Our party of two walked in the door, there was no one in line, yet no one greeted us or asked if we had any questions. After looking at the menu I ordered a breakfast burrito with turkey sausage and my partner had a Greek egg whites omelette. The flavor of the food was nonexistent. It is very rare for us not to finish our food when we go out to eat, but this is an exception for us. The cheese on the burrito was not cooked, tasted awful, and they forgot the feta cheese in my partners omelette! When the server finally brought us our food outside, she forgot forks and napkins. She told me I need to go inside to get those and did not offer any assistance or ask how our meal was. We will definitely not return, and will recommend that our friends and family try somewhere else when they are in Vegas! The Decour inside was very nice, we liked the water fountains have a laid-back atmosphere, but the food and the service was absolutely horrible."

G&P puts a healthy spin on a lot of popular dishes: burgers (available in beef, ostrich, turkey or veggie), pizzas, sandwiches, salads and a huge assortment of smoothies and health drinks. The food is delicious, the BBQ chicken or Greek pizzas are a sizable portion yet unbelievably low in calories. G&P is one of the few places nearby to get fresh squeezed juices, and their parfaits are awesome.\n\nThe downside is that Greens is a bit overpriced. During my last trip I opted to get a chicken Teriyaki wrap and at $11 I thought it was very overpriced. I guess this what you can charge for healthy food when you are right across the street for a LVAC. Staff and service is fine for an eatery of this size. Greens and Proteins is definitely worth checking out as one of the few clean eating spots in town."

They knocked it out of the park!!\n\nFirst, they were so polite from the first time I called several weeks ago to inquire about their catering. I mean they really sounded excited to help me, even though at that point, I was just feeling out the local businesses to see who we'd go with. Then I had made a few changes to the menu this last week, at which time they still sounded excited to do our large order. Then, the day before our event, I got a call from the chef and we talked over all our menu selections and I modified a couple items. My wife can't eat onions, so not only did they comply with removing onions from one of the items, but he made suggestions to add something else to compensate...above and beyond, love it!\n\nTheir catering menu online is easy to pick from and does a nice job describing the items. I do recommend the .pdf version as it's easier to read. We had a party for about 20 people, and while we bought way too much food, people were all raving about it and I think every single person asked me where we got it. I was so happy with all the selection. \n\nWe had quite a list:\n-Chicken quinoa cups (fantastic)\n-Mini ahi tostadas (didn't last long, omg they were good!)\n-Thai peanut chicken satay (awesome chicken strips on a stick!)\n-Grilled buffalo chicken skewers\n-Sweet potato goat cheese skewers (I wish we'd gotten 5 orders of these instead of 1, they are heavenly)\n-Tenderloin beef tip skewers (gone by the time I got food :-) a sign of how good they were )\n-Angus sliders (didn't get one, but people were raving! This is where I didn't get the onions and   the substitution was made...people loved them)\n-Caprese sliders (so good and tasted so fresh!)\n-1 each of grilled asparagus salad and the pear and goat cheese salad (both were so fresh and both fantastic) the salads are pretty big. \n\nMy pickup was at 5:30 and these guys were finishing it up on time to the minute. As the guys were carrying some of the items to my car, the chef and his crew were finishing up some of the last minute hot items. It was really busy in the restaurant and I truly appreciate that as I left, not only did the chef take a minute to go over everything with me, but one of the other guys took time to stand and look me in the eye, wish me luck with the party and said he really wanted feedback on how everything tasted.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic customer service and food for this catering event that was very important to me and my family! Thank you to the team at Greens and Proteins for making it wonderful!"

The acai bowl was almost completely frozen still. It had possibly the worst texture and consistency I've seen in an acai bowl. It was topped with granola and fruit which is nice but no honey or agave which left a lot of flavor to be desired. If I'm going to pay 8$ for a bowl, at least make sure to take the time to finish blending the acai instead of sending the bowl out half frozen. \n\nSo this place isn't terrible but could use some friendlier customer service, and I recommend shying away from the acai bowl."

Mostly because it is healthy food, and I need to eat better most of the time.\n\nThat being said, Greens and Proteins, while expensive, is worth it. I'm not saying I'd be dropping money here every week, but it is a splurge for a quick bite (or just a smoothie). Thus far I have had two of their smoothies, my favorite of the two being the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake: Cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This produces a smooth, yet thick smoothie I really enjoy.\n\nI've also had the Green Leaf Berry Blast: Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple, lemon, carrots, cabbage, spinach, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Not as good as the Peanut Butter Banana taste-wise, and the texture is much more watery. However, all those berries, and vegetables - you know you are getting a powerful boost of nutrition.\n\nLastly, food-wise I have had their BBQ chicken pizza. It comes out on a thin crust with low-fat mozzarella, chicken, and red onions. It was recommended to me by the staff and I have to agree with them - it was delicious, crisp, not at all greasy, and delightful to be eating a pizza that isn't AS BAD for me as other pizzas.\n\nOverall, I have no complaints about service or quality of food. The only thing is the big bite it takes out of your pocket book. Be prepared to spend upwards of $15-$20 if you want a meal and drink. For smoothies, the pricing is $7.50. It's not the cheapest, but when you are thinking of you health, isn't it priceless? Ha!"

Turns out its not as \"Healthy\" as it promotes to be and is a bit over priced for the quality of the food. To me, Health= organic. If its not organic its not healthy. I don't want to eat pesticides and chemicals, it defeats the purpose of the nutritious food. I went in a total of three different times ( in case someone didn't know what they were talking about) and I asked each time if any of their items were organic, the response \"NO.\" How is this a healthy place when the food, including veggies and fruits,  are not organic? And why is it so pricey when you're feeding me pesticides, chemicals, and no \"added\" but already there hormones? No thank You."

You will see many campers with computers because it offers free wi/fi. I might start bring my laptop. \n\nWhat I love about this place; I can build my own meal for 10 bucks. I order either chicken breast or the Filet. The chicken breast is so juicy and seasoned nicely for about 8 bucks. Filet is cooked to order and is amazingly good for 15 bucks. Now each build your own meal comes with a generous portion of a veggie and a gain. I do the broccoli and brown rice. No sauce for me. But sauce is available.\n\nDon't let me review fool you into thinking it is just builder your own meal. They have one of the best tasting health pizzas in town (i order the gluten free crust).  Honestly if someone can show me better I am up for the challenge.  \n\nAnd of course the have the traditional health juices and wraps.\n\nThe coolest thing about this place is the water jug next to the soda fountain. Fresh Lemons and Cucumbers added to filter water. It is so good! Ask for a cup at check-out it is free. \n\nOK friends go and try this place and let me know what you think :-)"

Decor is awesome with running water on the walls and bright green chairs.  \n\nMy only suggestion: salad bar or make your own salad.

I always get my usual and there is a difference in consistency between the two. Both places are good overall but the one thing that stands out between them is the customer service.\n\n I love their turkey chili but every bite has a 1:10 ratio of turkey and beans. I felt like the beans was the main course. Please change your recipe to add more turkey! I know it sounds a bit silly to make such a request but who would want to eat a spoon full of beans when the name is called turkey chili. \n\nThe batch they make is already pre-made. Everytime I've asked for light on the beans at the Rainbow location they made the effort to make me a batch of where they hand scoop out the extra beans for me for no extra charge. I tipped well as a thank you. It was amazing and I was very happy. It still looked and tasted like their original. (This location is next to my corporate office. I'm assuming they have better customer service to please the business professionals.)\n\nThis Eastern location, the chef didn't even care to try. They said they would have to charge me for an extra turkey patty. I basically had to pay $7.00 for a chopped up hamburger patty that's thrown on top of my chili. Not even mixed in for me. *image attached* It looked lazy. I had to bring it back and let them know I paid basically $14.50 for half a cup of chili with a patty thrown on top. I had to ask for a second cup of at least a bit of extra chili since I did paid in full for it.\n\nLittle situations like these are the details that makes a business good to great."

The girl got really annoyed when I presented her the groupon and told me it was only valid for two breakfast items, which the Greek pizza was not. She recommended the acai fruit bowl which I had no choice but to accept since I did not want to inconvenience her any further. I'll give this place a 4 star review because  the food was really delicious being that it's a lot healthier than I'm used to and the young waiter who brought out our food made up for the cashiers lack of customer service. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to change your diet but are afraid of trying foods a little out of your comfort zone. They have a variety of items to satisfy your cravings for breakfast lunch or dinner. However, the prices are definitely high enough to scare you away but I think it's worth the visit every now and then."

Much of the menu is vegan or vegetarian but not all of it-- it offers plenty of options for the carnivores so don't let that deter you from visiting.\n\nThe food was pretty impressive. The bun was hearty and filling, and the the actual bison meat was just as tasty as any beef I've ever had in a philly cheese steak. The sandwich itself is filling enough but does come with the fries. I probably will try the tofu fries next time because the jica \"fries\" were really just raw sliced vegetables that provided the optical illusion of fries but tasted nothing like them.

I don't remember what exactly they put in there, but they put a lot of greens that it made my head spin from reading the description. I was expecting it to taste like a veggie smoothie, but no!

He got the Bison burger with the raw jicama fries (I think that's what they were?). Mine was so yummy and that was the first time I ever tried tofu fries. They were seasoned so well. The wrap was delicious as well. It was a little bit dry but overall it had great flavor. \n\nMy husband's bison burger was probably the best thing out of both of ours. It was so yummy and juicy. I wish I got his burger instead, lol. I wasn't a fan of the raw jicama fries. They had a good seasoning on them but I did not care for them. \n\nI cannot comment on how the service was or what the decor looked like because he took it to go. We will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu."

It almost seems like it should be in Southern California. They have a large assortment of healthy items on their menu such as shakes, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. I decided to try the green leaf berry blast shake (carrots, kale, berries, spinach, soy milk, agave nectar, and vanilla extract) I've been every day for the past 5 days since for this shake its so delicious! I also tried the Greek pizza on gluten free crust.. YUM! Hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. The crust is actually amazing too it's almost like a flatbread. I will be suggesting this place to everyone and I can't wait for their 2nd location on Flamingo and the 215 to open! See you all there :)"

A little self control is required!  I promise, you will eat again so keep the splurging to a meal or two a week. Luckily in Vegas there are lots of healthy places to stop and eat and not feel guilty. I mean I can think of 4 or 5 just on Eastern!  Greens and Proteins can fill your stomach with some high quality fuel and make your taste buds jump for joy all while making sure you look good for the pool party season. \n\nThe salads are awesome and you can add really good salmon for a protein boost. The lettuce wraps are always a light healthy meal. Their juices are good but for me I ask them to leave some of the fruit out as I don't want as much sugar.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  You can get in and out quickly for breakfast, lunch or dinner or you can also choose to sit and enjoy a great meal and conversation. I love sitting outside and feeling the wonderful Vegas warmth in the evenings. Enjoy a glass of the complimentary cucumber water that is ice cold and plentiful. \n\nWe all love to eat but we all also want to be healthy and look great. We all like convenience and most of us don't have time or desires to cook three meals a day.  This place can help you live the life you want while eating healthy and enjoying your food. \n\nEat to live, but live to experience life. \nAaron"

Also tasted the jicama a friend had chosen and it was good too.\nAnd their water is infused with cucumber and lemon and is YUM!\n\nEveryone liked their food.

They offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free choices, plus animal for those who are so inclined. \nThe bright green color scheme is still overwhelming for my eyes. They had 2 tvs to keep you occupied. Lots of seating inside and a few tables outside. When I came in on a Saturday around 11- it was pretty quiet but the dining area was pretty messy. A lot of tables with crumbs and food items and the floor was dirty as well. \nMy veggie burger was way over cooked. It was dark brown and really crunchy. Hard to finish it because it was pretty dry. \nWent today and had the mock chicken wraps. They were so salty. I couldn't even finish them. \nStaff was friendly and professional."

I walked in and the main color is earth tones and green. They have a kitchen/juice bar open for you to see everything being freshly made.  Clean white counter tops. The tables look like tree trunks. You can sit inside or outside. Very hipster scenery with people grabbing smoothies/coffee while sitting and doing work, having a meeting, etc. People bring their dogs and just relax outside for hours.\n\nMy friend and I shared a meal. The lady taking our order seemed the least interested in her job. I was shocked on how someone in just a bland mood could work at such an inspiring lifestyle restaurant. I even asked her for an extra cup, so I could split our smoothie, and gave off an attitude I was asking too much. But her mood was not going to put a damper on my experience. She handed us our # and we proceeded to sit outside to enjoy the day.\n\nMy friend and I got a wellness smoothie which was very green but a hint of sweet. This was perfect because I hate sweet. You could taste all the fresh veggies in it.  We also got the veggie burger with the fried tofu fries. The veggie burger was on a wheat bun with onions, tomato, and lettuce (not gross iceberg lettuce). You can do cheddar or swiss cheese or make it vegan and get no cheese. If you got here, YOU MUST try the tofu fries. They are like a steak fry thickness, deep fried with a cajun seasoning. They bring a spicy mayo our but I prefer ketchup.\n\nWe sat outside enjoying the beautiful natural sunlight and cool breeze. Our waiter was very polite and brought out food out. He was quick to clean up when we were done. You do not feel pressured to leave but just relax. The waiter saw a lady with a dog working and brought the dog a water bowl. I thought is was a wonderful act of kindness. I will definitely be coming back."

This is my first time here even though I often go next door and hit up Starbucks.  The menu is rather large and it will take you minute to read everything over.  They are gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, and low-carb friendly place that offers a nice selection of soups, salads, burgers, 9\" pizzas, smoothies, sandwiches/wraps and a choice to even create your own meal.  After pondering what to eat I decided on a burger.  What is more classic than a burger and if they could make it right then I would be encouraged to try more off the menu. \n\nI ordered the buffalo burger done to a medium (they also have ostrich which I have never had) and tofu fries.  There is also an option for the jicama fries.  I was told the jicama fries are fry-shaped pieces of jicama tossed in a dressing.  I shied away from the jicama because I have not had it before personally but I did hear they are good.  The tofu fries are firm tofu tossed in rice flow and fried.  They are delicious!  The burger can come on a wheat or gluten-free bun or as a wrap. I chose the wheat bun and got Swiss cheese on my burger.  The burger itself is massive stacked with a thick patty, lettuce, tomato and onion!  I can barely fit it in my mouth!  The bread to meat ratio for the burger is perfect.  I took a bite and the burger is done exactly right (medium), juicy and tender.  \n\nFor my buffalo burger, tofu fries, pickle and a soda cost me a little over $14 including tax.  A good price for a nice buffalo burger.  Also their soda machine dispenses small ice pellets.  This is an important point to make for my fellow ice munchers! \n\nThe place is WiFi ready but you will have to ask for the passkey to access the network. When I asked the staff about power access they did not know but I was able to speak to Jeff, one of the owners, and he was able to show me where to plug in.  For those needing a place to work there are a TON of plugs (long power strips) under the bench along the back wall of the restaurant. Just a little looking and you will see them.       \n\nIf you are looking for a nice place to grab a healthy bite to eat (even with your GF, Vegan or Uber-health conscious friends)  then look no further than the Greens and Proteins!"

Everyone was really friendly, from the cashier to the manager, and their customer service was excellent. I can't say the same about the food. First off, I ordered the \"wellness juice\" which isn't a juice at all, I watched the girl prepare it throw vegetables into a blender and it was this disgusting, warm slush of liquid-y vegetables. I'm a green juice hound, and I don't know why they market their drinks as \"juices\" if they're more like slushed-up smoothies? The smoothie-thing had a horrible aftertaste like the vegetables had gone bad, and I only took one sip before throwing it in the trash. Secondly, I ordered an albacore salad which was literally a lump of canned tuna thrown on top of a bed of lettuce. I don't know who decided to call this thing a salad but it's definitely not what most people would consider to be a salad. The lump of canned tuna and lettuce bed was horribly tasteless and the lettuce was wilted and soggy. It makes me so sad that I didn't find what I was so hopeful to find in greens and protein. I was really excited to find my new favorite healthy cafe. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the employees were really friendly & helpful. But unfortunately, the horrible food was a dealbreaker for me, and I won't be a returning customer."

This place does not have a staff on the A game.  C to D at best.\n\nTo have trust and faith in a place, it really needs to start with the person taking the order to hit the right keys and input your order correctly.  It's not rocket science and no one is being rushed, so to get your order wrong is just a sign of incompetence.  \n\nWe have been here 3 times now and have had bad experiences.  The first bad experience was the wrong smoothies being made.  The second time, the smoothies were not made properly.  We got close to what we ordered, but the people just seem to be too inexperienced.  \n\nNow the third time, they advertise to be HCG and Vegan friendly, however, the chef and owner are not Vegans, and have not read a Vegan cook book.  Hint, hint, maybe will help becoming more familiar with what you are advertising.  This place is still kind of new, but you should have a clue before you make a claim and advertise that you are friendly to people's needs.\n\nAgain, the order was put in wrong at the register which cause the entire experience to go nowhere but down, which is sad.  This place has a LOT OF POTENTIAL, as I said in the beginning and I would love to see this place succeed if the owners and chef have the ability to tighten up their ship and get things right.  With all the holes in their staff, which leads to bad experiences by customers, ships full of holes only go in be direction, down.....as of now, I cannot give this place any more then 2 stars.  We will probably give hem one last chance before we write them off completely, I just hope they stay in business long enough for this to happen."

You pick a protein, grain, veggie and a sauce. That was probably my favorite meal here.\nI also have tried the Gluten free pizza and it was pretty tasty.\n\nThe bad-\nI ordered a burger with a gluten free bun. The gluten free bun was stale and hard.  I was really disappointed.\nI know people seem to love the tofu fried but I did not like them. They were just rubbery and tasteless.\n\n\nThe service for me has always been pretty good. Once, they messed up me and my husband's order and they were quick to make it right, giving us an extra order of tofu fries. Though once my husband went in to pick up our order and a kid at the front desk called him \"boss\" which really annoyed him. He found it a bit condescending. \n\nYes, I will go here again. I actually meet people here all the time. The dinning room is comfortable the decor is organic and inviting."

The Tofu Fries were a fun and tasty alternative to french fried potatoes. Again, really generous portion. Every juice and smoothie I've had has been really good - I would suggest asking the juice-maker on staff which one she/he recommends based on your likes and dislikes. They will suggest one and dial it in for you. \n\nThe food may be a dollar or two more than a comparable cafe-style restaurant, but you truly get it back in terms of portion size and quality. It takes one visit to realize this.\n\nAnd, the staff actually looks healthy here. That says a lot!\n\nWish I lived closer. Will definitely eat here next time I'm at Eastern/215 for the Cars & Coffee car meetup on Saturdays.\n\nFYI, there seem to be 'green' health cafe imitators popping up around the Valley. Try Greens and Proteins first - this place is the real deal. Greens and Proteins reminds me of R Thomas in Atlanta (a 24hr health food cafe) and that is a compliment. \n\nAlso, there is free Wi-fi here, and I noticed power outlets all along the back booths (like over 40 outlets in a row) so this would be a great alternative to a coffee shop if you need to hunker down and get some laptop work done."

Warning: watering system for the wall plants make a startling sound.\n\nParking is a piece of cake.

They bus the tables too so don't awkwardly stand holding your refuse while darting your eyes around like I did.\n\nI ordered a small caesar salad. It was huge. I couldn't finish it. It was standard taste. Also had a green ginger limeade. It was a whopping $5.99. It was dense, flavorful, refreshing and pleasant. But the thing I have to come back for are the \"tofu fries.\" They were thick, fried strips of tofu. Not caked in batter. Not oily.

This place is not Taco Bell, folks. You're paying for high quality, great-tasting, healthy food here -- not processed belly fill packed with preservatives that only tastes good when you're hammered or \"high on life.\" For what you get, the prices at Greens & Proteins are very reasonable, in my opinion.\n\nI typically choose the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\" option, where you pair a grain, vegetable, and protein of your choice with your favorite sauce on the side. I usually opt for the bison patty ($12.99) or the chicken breast ($9.99) and always have a hard time deciding which delicious sauce to order (the options are aged balsamic, spicy peanut, citrus BBQ, walnut cilantro pesto, teriyaki, lemon vinaigrette, or tangy buffalo). The Bison Cheesesteak Wrap is also one of my favorite items ($10.99) and I usually see a bunch of them getting ordered during my visits."

When we arrived, the line was twelve people deep, so our assumption was the food was worth the wait.\n\nAs we waited we noticed the manager or owner take a person out of line and personally take and expedite her order. At first, I thought he was trying to speed service. The woman in front of us commented, \"if I were in tight spandex maybe I'd skip to the front of the line too.\" Sure enough, the helpful employee did not take anyone else out of line to take their order and stayed chatting with the young woman until her smoothie came.\n\nMeanwhile, my associate noted prices were higher than she really wanted to pay for a smoothie or lunch. Since we were already waiting and the lunch hour was winding away, I reminded her I was treating.\n\nAdventurous, I ordered the ostrich burger with tofu fries. My companion ordered a smoothie and a make your own meal with salmon and rice. By the time we paid, the helpful manager had long since seen his prey leave with her smoothie and was sitting alone at her table on his phone texting or maybe yelping. \n\nWe waited to take our food to go. As we waited, we both cringed hearing the cook at the grill sneezing. This is incidental as I'm sure he was sanitary about the sneeze, but it's still not something you want to hear as your food's being prepared, and it bolstered a so far unsatisfactory experience.\n\nWe eventually received our order and rushed back to our office to eat.\n\nMy coworker's first comment in the car? \"This smoothie is terrible. I can get a better one a Whole Foods for half the price.\" \n\nWe waited till the office to start in on the rest. My ostrich burger wasn't bad. This was my second ostrich burger ever and it ranked top two. The tofu fries were actually pretty tasty. \n\nUnfortunately, my coworker's meal wasn't as tasty. Already unhappy with the smoothie she asked me to taste her rice. The rice was still uncooked. The fish on the other hand was overcooked. For the rest of the day all I heard her say was, \"that smoothie was not worth nine dollars\" and \"how hard is it to cook rice?\""

Choose the protein (grilled, steamed or sauted) which includes low fat Ostrich, Bison, turkey, etc. Next you choose your veggie which range from asparagus, spinach, broccoli, etc. Next you choose grains- mashed sweet potatoes, cous cous, brown rice, low carb pasta, etc. Lastly you choose the sauce which is everything from peanut sauce, salad dressing to a pesto or bbq sauce. The combination choices are endless! \n\nThe drink selection really turns me on. They offer several different unique smoothies and also some that combine healthy herbs and veggies with coffee I can't wait to try. The soda fountain has figure friendly Coke Zero, Light Lemonade and Sprite Zero. This is unheard of to have all of them! \n\nNext time you want to get your healthy on EAT HERE.

I like that both locations are located in the same plaza as the gym I belong to, it's convinient to grab a bite to eat afterwards. So why not 5 stars? Here's my beef with G&P:\n\n1. The listed calories next to the item doesn't count the entire entree, i.e;\n      *Turkey Burger w/ alfafla, L,T,O and low fat cheese (served on a bun and tofu fries) that is everything included in the entree, so my thought would be the calorie count should include everything, right? Nope, it doesn't include the bun or the tofu fries or the cheese. \n\n2. Food should be organic for the price. Especially the vegetables/fruits going into the juices & smoothies. Average price is $7.50.\n\n3. Employees should be more knowledgable about their product. When I asked two employees about the calorie count, both gave me a different answer. Also, when I had lunch with my vegan friend, she asked if the sauce that came with the tofu fries was vegan, the girl had no idea, she had to go in the back to ask. Turns out, it's not. \n\nI still like the place, I am just more aware of what I'm eating here. There are a few items on the menu I'm in love with, vegan pizza, tofu fries and the wellness drink, these will keep me coming back, also I love the cucumber water."

My friend and I were just looking for a nice quite place to chat and this place seemed like a good fit... The atmosphere was really casual; it was really calm and inviting, definitely had a trendy coffee shop feel to it. That night it was filled with a lot of young girls in yoga pants and gym shorts... I figured it must be the post-workout spot for the ladies from the LVAC across the lot.\n\nAnyhow... as we came in my friend had ordered a wheat grass drink and we took to a table along the back wall. The seating area was nice, all of the tables were cleared and they had a grape green hue to match the healthy theme of the entire place. What was also nice was the waterfall that ran across the entirety of the back wall. Definitely gave it a calming feel with a modern nature theme... if you can try to picture that.\n\nAs we were seated I couldn't help but notice the quality of service the server/cashier was providing. While taking every order he would try to acknowledge the guest by their first name. It definitely gave it a personalized feel. It was nice to see, and I could notice a lot of the guests were regulars... if only they did a better job at greeting us as we entered the place. \n\nWhile we were seated I also ended up ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap. The price was a little unreasonable for what I got, I understand it's a healthy choice but for $10.99 I expect to get a little more for the buck. I guess all that extra money went into the plating and presentation, which brings me to the next point. For as good as it looked the flavor was very disappointing. The wrap had no taste at all; the only thing that helped me distinguish the ingredients was their texture. \n\nOverall for what we came for I would say it definitely met our expectations and didn't disappoint, however the food wasn't so great. The ambiance was 5/5, Service was 4/5, and the Food Quality was 3/5; presentation was great, ingredients seemed fresh and health, but the taste was not there at all. Maybe it was just what I had ordered.\n\nI will most likely not eat here again but if I needed a nice casual meeting spot I would definitely keep this place in mind. Although my experience with the food was not pleasant the intent of the visit was for a casual meeting spot and it definitely delivered on that."

I appreciate the quality of ingredients and having a place to eat at on the go and I don't have to feel guilty or worry about how it's made.\n\nMy last few visits, I realized how boring and uninspired their food is. It's dull and lackluster. It's almost everything I dislike about clean eating.\n\nG&P offers healthy/raw/healthy versions of classic foods: burgers (beef, ostrich, turkey, veggie, etc.), pizza, salads, wraps. They're vegan, Paleo, Gluten-Free, Raw, vegetarian, HCG, and carnivore friendly. Anything good made there, I can make at home for way less, and have several servings.\n\nI'm really mixed up about this. It very much has its pros and it's cons. Vegas doesn't have a lot of guilt-free dining options, so it's refreshing, service is great, it's always clean, and the staff is super friendly and knowledgable. \n\nI'm torn. Will I continue to give them my patronage? Yes. The advice I offer them is to start thinking outside of the box. Please?\n\nFood is prepared well.  It's so simple and uninspired. How about doing something like, The Pinterest Clean Eating Recipe of the Week or some shit? Come on G&P!\n\nPro-tip: Get those tofu fries and whatever sauce they're served with! Amaze balls!"

Definitely an interesting healthy menu I'd like to come try again, especially the Ostrich Burger, even though it's pretty heavy on your wallet, $14.99. But I heard ostrich is pricey.\n\nJicama fries that comes with the burgers are very interesting. Not french fries, far from it. It's more like seasoned radish slices. That's definitely a healthy substitute... definitely not as yummy as french fries. A+ for effort, though. Many items for people who are on that HCG diet, too.\n\nFree Wi-Fi inside and the decor is very modern and hip. The place looked very clean and orderly. There were lots of take-out orders going out, so lots of people seem to like this place. Always a good sign...\n\nI'll definitely come back here. I think you get a check-in discount on their smoothies, so I'll come back for those and more healthy eats!"

Haha this location is right next to Starbucks but I've been trying to eat healthier so I decided to give it a try. \n\nThe line was really long. Almost out the door. I had to kind of stand off to the side because it was so busy. The staff was extremely nice. Their menu items are listed as well as the calorie count so that is much appreciated. I decided to try the acai berry smoothie (acai, green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, pineapple, coconut, beet powder, spinach, kale, honey, banana, and peaches). Yum! \n\nThe smoothie took awhile to make but it was delicious and very filling for me. I also decided on the low carb Caesar salad.  I actually really disliked this salad. Not recommended. Maybe it was the Parmesan crisps on the top or the EVOO caesar dressing but I didn't like the way it tasted at all. However the decor is very beautiful, vibrant green chairs and they have real plants, along with 2 waterfalls against the back walls. Beautiful and relaxing! \n\nPros: beautiful decor, friendly staff, free wifi, nice outside patio seating as an option, complimentary cucumber water, tv's along the wall \n\nCons: hard to find parking, long lines sometimes out the door \n\nWould I go back? Yes! Next time I would love to try their ahi protein salad and the chocolate peanut butter banana shake! \n\nTip*** I checked in with Yelp and received $1 off my smoothie"

It's always awesome too. \n\nI've been here many times and usually get the green wellness drink but this time I tried the acai berry juice instead.  It was really good.  Very fruity but still with kale and spinach to make it a super smoothie in case you're counting calories and need  your fruit  and veggie fix. The wellness smoothie is also a great choice since it combines fresh fruit and veggies together for a blend that's really awesome as well. I think both are excellent choices.  \n\nFor food I usually get the bbq chicken pizza because it's delicious and only 320 calories for the whole thing. That is nothing short of a miracle. How can something be so delicious and healthy at thethe Same  time? ? Boggles my mind but still keeps me coming back. I definitely recommend this  place to anyone looking to eat healthier but is having trouble making the switch. They make it so easy here."

They have a variety of protein sources for carnivores and vegetarians: ostrich, bison, chicken, ahi tuna, steak, tofu, etc. They have grains and veggies. And I must say, I love how they cook their tofu - it's warm, lightly crisp and flavorful.\n\nMy favorites include the bison burger with tofu fries, ahi tuna salad, acai berry smoothie, and my custom combo (ahi tuna with broccoli or asparagus, brown rice and pesto).\n\nThe calorie info is displayed on their menu. Food does not have to be laden with fat, salt and sugar to taste good."

Also parking is a pain as the Starbucks next door draws a lot of traffic so the idea of fighting for a space just to get bland food and an overpriced smoothie is not appealing. 2 Stars...but that's only because I'm being nice and want to save 1 Star reviews for places that truly deserve it."

So this what we ordered and shared:\n\n1st dish:  Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome.  The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty.  I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good.  The chorizo was da bomb!  The dish even came with tofu nuggets, which was amazing too.  They really need to add tofu nuggets as an appetizer.  I could eat that all day... just pop it in my mouth.\n\n2nd dish: Granola toasted french toast... ok i must admit, that it wasn't  vegan because of the type of whole wheat bread that they used.. but it was all good with me cuz they didn't use egg to coat the granola to the bread.... so i just decided to try it.  It was delish!!!  The granola was mixed in with nuts, and raisins...mmm, mmm, mmm.  I felt like my breakfast turned into a dessert, but at the same time, it just tasted healthy. :) \n\nthis place is like halfway between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant... but to my surprise the dishes were visual appearing.  They took time to make it look pretty and presentable.   I was so hungry and the food looked so good, that I didn't take any pictures of my food.   I also think that the dishes are reasonably priced.  We paid less than $20 for both dishes....I love paying $20 or less for 2 people when I go out to eat.  Hey, when the food is good and the price is right, then that's an awesome deal. \n\n I will go back for sure and order more off the vegan menu and try to take pics of it before I feed my face.  I recommend you try this place out and your taste buds will say thank you."

She put me on hold to check with a manager, and came back to tell me there would be no guarantee that they could accommodate us. The time we would be visiting was a busy time, and she stated that they could not promise to reserve tables for us. So I asked if we could be seated at separate tables, to which she repeated her original statement: she could not promise us that we could be accommodated. This was extremely frustrating, as we were told in advance that we could make reservations, and it would NOT be an issue, and now I had a team of 18 people with out a place to eat.\n\nMy fellow team mate that originally made the reservations called, and spoke with a different girl this time - and she had no record of the reservation made under her name, days before. The girl assured us that she would have the manager call us back, but we never received a phone call. This resulted in us having to find a different place to go to, an hour before our event was supposed to occur. \n\nWhy would management originally say YES, you can take a reservation for a large party, only to go back on your word, and put myself and my team in a difficult situation. We were told that our reservations were set, and when the day came, no one had any idea of what we were talking about. WHY would you make promises that you cannot keep? That is a huge customer service no-no.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, she was had NO empathy, did not offer ANY solutions for me, and was so unprofessional. Customer service is the most important aspect of a business. For this reason alone, I will not be back again."

What a waste of $10.99!  \n\nLettuce (romaine I think) was very tough and hard, simply wrapped around a bunch of tofu (looked like the tofu fries before being breaded and cooked).  Not wrapped at all so all the filling fell out as soon as I picked it up.  The tofu was supposed to be marianated, but it certainly wasn't.   When I marinate tofu in teriyaki sauce, it absorbs the marinade and turns brown.  G&P's tofu was still white and flavorless.  Supposed to include cukes and something else.  Nothing but a lettuce leaf, flavorless tofu and sauce (which dripped all over the plate).   When I went back to the counter to talk to the manager, I was told they weren't in!\n\nThis place blew it.

There are plenty of seats outside the patio if the weather is nice, & inside it's very spacious, with trendy tables, a nice wall backdrop with running water, & several televisions. Service is alright. Nothing going beyond the means of customer service & nothing that's bad either.\n\nIf you are anyone who is a raw foodie, don't expect this place to state it uses USDA Organic certified items just because it's named 'Greens and Proteins' (that's a question I'm going to ask the next time I'm in!) The menu is definitely a little more healthier than your fast-food alternatives, with wraps, pizza, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, juices, the works. The pricing was what got me, since I could get a green smoothie at Whole Foods for about .50 cents less than here (one that is a lot less sweeter). \n\nI purchased the vegetable wrap & the green smoothie, all of which came out to $20 (definitely not cheap, as most health-alternative restaurants aren't). I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the green smoothie turned out! While $7.50 is a little much, at the same time it was in a cup that was generous in size for its price. It was very sweet (from the agave nectar & stevia), nothing like the green smoothies from Whole Foods which are a little more on the less sweeter end. I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing! \n\nWalking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here. I debated giving it three stars, but I was reminded by my green smoothie it's definitely a place I'd like to return to when I'm in the neighborhood craving a healthy alternative to other restaurants surrounding them!"

Super happy they're open later than the others! \n\nI have been here a few times before, I've had their smoothies which are consistently tasty, blended well and healthy. (don't forget to use the check-in offer!) \n\nThis time I opted for a meal since I just finished my lifting workout. I got the build your own HCG meal which comes with a choice of protein and vegetables. I got the grilled chicken breast, which was grilled perfectly. Tender and juicy on the inside. And steamed asparagus, which was cooked well. It also comes with a lemon slice and side sauce, tasted like a dijon mustard. Meal pricing is based on what meat you choose, chicken breast was $10. Packed in a reusable container. The portion size and price were just right. \n\n*** LOVES: \n- fast and friendly service! Cashier was nice and helpful with answering my questions and the guy cleaning up tables and serving orders was also friendly and helpful. He offered to check on my order so I didn't have to wait long. I really wasn't waiting long. ;-) \n\n- Loved the way it's designed. Clean, open, modern interior. Loved the green trim.\n** complimentary cucumber lemon water. My choice of drink is always water, no matter where I go. Have to stay hydrated! \n\nOther likes: \n- tvs available to watch the game \n- not crowded or busy when we went (Thursday, 8pm) \n- a lot of healthy options, looking forward to trying them \n- new locations popping up all over the valley\n\nLoved this place, will be back again and recommending to others! \n\nTIP: don't forget if you haven't used it, they still have the check-in offer,  $1 OFF smoothie!"

Greens and Proteins is a unique healthier fresh option of just about anything you normally eat. They offer fresh juices and smoothies with everything from kale, to watermelon, pineapple and wheat grass. They also have elk and ostrich burgers and bison cheesesteaks. My personal favorites are the wellness drink (a veggie/fruit mixture) and the berry parfait. That comes with yogurt, house made granola, dried and fresh fruit. There are breakfast lunch and dinner options available, and they come with sides like jicama or tofu fries. This place has made eating healthy so much easier.

I ordered a peanut butter banana smoothie which was chalk full of veggies,peanuts,raisins etc. I elected almond milk as well. The price was reasonable and I received my smoothie really quick. \n\nAs for the taste... Less to be desires but good for being healthy. I would order a different shake next time. The texture was too gritty for me. I prefer my smoothies.. Well smooth! \n\nThe food looked amazing and smelled great. Everyone eating seemed to love the food. I was impressed with the menu and hope to go back soon and try a bison burger! Yum!!!"

You select a protein, vegetable, and carb.  I went with the chicken breast, asparagus, and mashed sweet potatoes (a little less than.  Everything tastes so good!  The chicken was sliced, juicy and well seasoned.  The asparagus was great dipped in the lemon vinaigrette I selected and of course the mashed sweet potatoes were good!

The burger was delicious and flavored to perfection. The baked tofu fries were insanely good too. I left the restaurant wishing that more places offered this as a side. Don't fret, carnivores. There are plenty of great meat options for you too.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual stop for a bite to eat, without the worry of having to loosen your belt a few notches after. Greens and Proteins is the right place to be. I just wish there were more places like this around the valley for the more health conscious eater."

No, I would not consider any part of my diet to be vegan-friendly, however G&P makes the transition into vegan dining a tasty and judgement free venture!\n\nThe setting is very modern-bright, clean lines and a cool planter along the wall facing the counter with a built in watering system. It adds another element of cool when the water turns on to feed the plants. There are a couple of TVs against the back wall, which kind of don't fit into the zen feeling of the place yet...they don't feel out of place if that makes sense. Maybe I'm just used to dining in places that have TVs which I don't  know if that's a good or bad thing.\n\nI judge an establishment, if given the opportunity, on their Caesar salad. It's a menu staple that so many places get wrong but G&P doesn't and their dressing is egg and sardine free. I was really ready to be disappointed with the salad- I mean you don't leave out two classic elements of the dressing and not have outrage-but the dressing was surprisingly creamy and so flavorful. It was one of the best I've ever had. What I really loved was the parmesan croutons. Again, another element of the salad that could go wrong, G&P put a fun and creative twist on with delicious results!\n\nWhat I've had most frequently here is the green shake which is made with kale, almond (or soy) milk, apples, and some other fruits (check out their helpful menu for more info....), which is blended into a refreshing shake that's perfect for summer. I'm not into the whole smoothie as a meal replacement deal, but a couple of times after my evening yoga class got out, I've popped over for this shake and skipped dinner. It's pretty filling and all of the right flavors are there. \n\nAlso on their menu is a variety of pizzas with alternative crust options, burgers and appetizers all in vegan and non-vegan options. I introduced a friend to this place and she was really excited that they had gluten free pizza crust which also didn't taste like cardboard. I guess that's hard to come by, so she told me I owed them one star alone just for that!\n\nWhat I like most is that the restaurant offers a variety of food-vegan and non-vegan- in a non-judgy environment. The food is quality and it's a great option if you're looking to meet somewhere with your vegan friend(s) without compromising. This is also a safe place to venture into vegan cuisine without feeling like you're missing anything-the quantity and flavor are all there! It is a bit pricey, but what places in this area aren't?\n\nG&P is a great place for all three meals or those in between ones that you get around to when life happens and lunch doesn't. The staff is nice, the establishment is clean and the concept great!"

It's nice to offer a version of fast food gone healthy, but I found many of the options very bland.  The jicama \"fries\" are a nice choice, but I'll go for the seasoned tofu fingers over the cool jicama any day.  The addition of the crunchy/healthy side is nice, though.  I had bites of the bison burger ordered by others at the table, which was fine - a typical bison burger, but my veggie patty was not what I expected.  I thought since the place focuses on healthy that the veggie patty would be - veggie.  But nope, it's 100% soy and pretty bland.  I was pretty dissappointed.  Some of the drinks/smoothies are fun, but it's not enough to draw me in without a meal I'm excited about.  I'll try more things, maybe some wraps will rock my world, but the bland and soy-ness of the veggie patty was enough to discourage me for a while."

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this, because I didn't try one. \n\nI had the build your own plate with basmati rice, \"marinated\" tofu, broccoli, and to my dismay, lemon vinegrette.\nI began to order it with teriyaki sauce in mind, but when I inquired about the peanut sauce just to see, I was informed that the only two vegan sauces were lemon vinegrette or a balsamic reduction. Caught off guard I went for lemon, which turned out to be straight up lemon juice and olive oil. The tofu was far from marinated, and I smothered my food in hot sauce to make it a little more edible. The broccoli was just fine, but even a decent steamed vegetable doesn't have the power to save bland tofu and dry rice.\n\nThe tofu \"French fries\" were the only thing I tasted that I would even consider paying money for... But that won't happen since I won't be giving this place a second chance.\nPerhaps it's a just a hit or miss kind of place, but if that's the case, then I would like to know what that hit is.

It looks pretty clean and well-maintained, except for the dusty fake plants by the booths (yuck!). The young woman at the cash register was a bit unfriendly, but one of the guys behind the counter talked to us while we waited, which made the experience a little better. \n\nAnyway, our group ordered: the lean angus beef burger, a teriyaki grilled chicken (wheat) wrap and the bison cheese steak (spinach) wrap.\n\nThe teriyaki grilled chicken wrap was filled with lean chicken, and definitely had more of a garden-y taste because of the fresh veggies in it. There wasn't a strong teriyaki taste, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. The jicama fries that I ordered with it weren't really that appealing. It was tasteless and watery, so it didn't really make me want to finish them off. I guess I should've just ordered the tofu fries instead. \n\nThe bison cheese steak was the better of the two wraps (or maybe that's just my inner fat kid talking)... but I didn't see how it was healthy because it was dripping with oil. I'm not that disappointed with it because it was still pretty flavorful!\n\nThey had complimentary cucumber/lemon infused water, which is really refreshing especially in the summer heat. \n\nPortions may look small to some, but it was surprisingly filling.

Especially for strip mall food but lots of quality and fresh ingredients make this a justifiable expense. This is not just a bunch of freeze dried crap from the Sysco truck. \n\nHere's the thing for this glorious temple of health: we really need detailed nutritional information. Myself and the other regular clients are extremely dietarily concerned. We have Macros and Calorie totals that are a delicate balance, and the nutritional information we get, when we get it, will just be a calorie number. That number is clearly not accurate as often it is attached to an item that can be served seven different ways. They also don't elaborate on side items. We really need detailed counts of carbs, protein and fat and a way to account for how changes in order (extra cheese, different wrap type, etc...) account for changes in nutritional information.\n\nI wouldn't normally complain about this for a restaurant that has two locations but this is crucial for this type of establishment.

Magic.\n\nThe cucumber and lemon infused water washes away any bad feelings I could have had about the price.

Probably won't return, sorry. \n\nThere are many other options in Las Vegas like SkinnyFats, Grass Roots Juice Bar, and JuiceNGo that have similar options and taste better."

The service is abhorrently slow, they aren't particularly customer-centric and the prices for what you get are super high.\n\nI've been in several times, don't know why I'm just now writing this, but I get the same thing generally every time.\n\nThis time walked up and was just asking a generic question, but was definitely ready to order when the guy in front of me picked up the phone and spent 3-4 minutes taking someone's order that was calling in. I just stood there and stared until he was done. Super rude.\n\nOrdered the vegetable parm and it came with a small side of spinach. I was under the impression that I was getting a side of spaghetti squash, but it was actually UNDER the parm. Weird. This small plate of absolutely nothing cost me $10. Not happy. \n\nI've had pizza here before as well and while it had a nice taste to it, it again wasn't worth what I paid for it.\n\nI get the concept here and I'm sure it looks cool when you hang out a place that touts itself as so healthy, but it really is a ripoff and the food isn't that great; it's just OKAY. \n\nSave some money and do it yourself, really."

            "review": "I selected Greens and Proteins (G&P) because I wanted a tasty, wholesome breakfast with no animal protein.  In short, I was not impressed with this establishment and its offerings. It seems to me that they are offering a watered down version of \"healthy\" food.\n\nEXPERIENCE: I struggled with their juice menu first. I juice and drink fresh juices from other establishments on a regular basis so I felt comfortable picking out a quick juice to start my meal. Unfortunately, agave nectar and honey were featured in all but one drink.   I can get added sugar anywhere in town, I was surprised that a place that calls itself a \"healthy kitchen and juice bar\" offered no pure juices. And that what they were presenting as juice was laden with a sweetener more processed than high fructose syrup (agave). \n\nNeedless to say, I chose the V9 juice since it offered some vegetable and contained no added sugar.  I asked for more greens (spinach and kale) in the juice with regular tomatoes rather than the sun dried tomatoes usually in the drink. The addition of vegetable stock to the juice was confusing for me. I saw them add a processed vegetable broth, not a stock, but that didn't bother me too much. I have never seen a juice offering with vegetable \"stock\", but I was willing to try it.  The \"juice\" was more of a blended concoction.  It was cold and thickish.  Especially as I got the end. What is was not, was tasty.  There was no bite from the lime or garlic and the \"stock\" watered down the taste of the vegetables. The texture and flavor were off putting, but I'd spent the $6.99 for 24 oz. (8oz of that are the vegetable broth) so I drank it. Most of it.\n\nMy mother ordered the Greek scramble with a side of the homemade turkey bacon. I ordered the \"Real Deal Oatmeal\" with some of the additions (raisins, bananas, and \"sucant\", which is sugar) on the side. The menu lists \"sucant\" as an ingredient in the oatmeal, but I believe G & P has misspelled the word Sucanat on their menu. Sucanat is a whole, unrefined cane sugar made by \"crushing sugar cane, extracting the juice, heating it, and dehydrating it into granules.\" It's still sugar, but many people consider it a healthier option because it contains less sucrose and \"retains the natural molasses and trace nutrients like iron, calcium, potassium, and B vitamins.\"\n\nI've ordered oatmeal at dozens of establishments in this town--most not presenting the image of a health conscious establishment---and I've never heard what I heard from G&P.  After ordering, the cashier had to come over and find me to tell me that they could not put the sugar (Sucanat) on the side.  \"Why\" I asked. She explained that the sugar is mixed in with the oatmeal. What??? I clarified in case I had misheard her.  I asked incredulously, \"The sugar is already mixed in with the oatmeal? So I can't get oatmeal without sugar?\" Correct.  She informed me that they pre-mix the sugar in the oatmeal.  To put this issue in context, a person can order rolled oats oatmeal at McDonald's without sugar.  How do they know how much sugar (Sucanat) I want in my oatmeal?   I imagine they err on the side of \"a lot.\" \n\nAll of the other breakfast options included animal protein or sugar except for the Berry Parfait. I ordered it without the strawberry yogurt since I assumed that it had more sugar than I would like. I asked for plain yogurt in the parfait. The chef happened to be out on the floor and the cashier (misunderstanding my request?) asked the chef what was in the strawberry yogurt. He stated that it was plain yogurt with strawberries and sweeteners added.  I don't eat pre-sweetened yogurt and figured the strawberries and sweetened granola would add enough sugar to the meal. He said they had plain yogurt in the back and that they could accommodate me. \n\nThe parfait was fine--lots of large strawberries and sweet crunchy granola.  I tasted one of Mom's tofu fries and it was crunchy and well seasoned. She enjoyed her egg white scramble and turkey sausage side.\n\nI understand everyone visiting G & P will not share my expectations. If people are looking for a place with some vegetables and some healthier options, this place is solid.  I love that they have a raw section on their menu. I also appreciate the lean meats on their menu that are not easy to find elsewhere: bison and ostrich. \n\nSERVICE: Great service. They did a fantastic job of accommodating me.\n\nSUMMARY: Greens and Proteins seems a decent option for those on a plant-based diet looking for restaurant options, those seeking non-certified gluten free options,  or those looking for more generally healthy food options. \n\nIt was not a good place for me. When I patronize a \"healthy\" establishment, I am seeking whole foods, less refined sugars and grains, great taste, few if any processed foods, and greater raw (and cooked) vegetable options. I do not think I will return to Greens and Proteins."

I still appreciate what they do, but the quality is slippling. \n\nThe last few visits have been a nightmare.  My fiance and I used to visit several times a week to get pizzas.  The last two times, the pizzas have been inedibly burned on the bottom.  One time, it took so long that we were given a complimentary drink.  The last time we visited, my fiance and I ordered the exact same thing but I got my pizza literally TWENTY MINUTES before he got his.  I really think they forgot to make it, because when I asked the person who brought me my food about it, he scrambled into the kitchen and the workers suddenly hopped-to.  There was nothing resembling an apology either.  Also, the last time I got a Wellness Drink (my favorite), it was still chunky and wouldn't fit through the straw.  Eww.  I didn't notice until I left or I would have sent it back.  The Wellness Drink is SOOOO expensive, but I don't really mind... that is, if the quality matches the price.\n\nA note to the owners of this place (because I've talked to you and I KNOW you read this):  Just because you get busy doesn't mean you can let the quality become inconsistent.  It's great to have an increased sales volume, but customer loyalty is important too.  I haven't recommended this to a friend for a while because, frankly, I'm not sure if it's going to be a good G&P day or a bad G&P day anymore.\n\nI haven't been to G&P for a while.  I'm not really itching to return anytime soon either."

The complimentary \"cucumber lemon\" water was way too cucumber-y and there was absolutely zero lemon in it. False advertising.

Easy to sit and chat for a while.\n               Turkey- It's real, sliced turkey; not processed deli meat.\n\nNegatives: \n\n                 Food quality- I'm annoyed how they come across to everyone. They want you to think this is amazing healthy food.  Not one item on their menu is organic.  They also don't have a lot of alternative ingredients to choose from. They seem to have limited knowledge of gluten-free and vegan foods. This leads me to the next negative.\n\n                 Price- It is pretty expensive.  At least 7 dollars for a smoothie and at least 10 dollars for a sandwich.  It would be understandable if they used organic, high quality ingredients, but no.  Their ingredients do not cost much at all, therefore they are taking advantage of people.  \n\n               Environmentally friendly? - First of all, they don't use real plates. (They care about health but not environment.) So they use paper plates.  Okay, at least they quickly biodegrade.  But wait! The utensils are crappy plastic ones.  What the heck? Be consistent. \n\nOverall, I seriously feel that whoever opened this place does not care about any of the things they market.  I think they know that being healthy is in, and are trying to bank on it.  They should be serving organic fruits, veggies and meats.  They should have a vast working knowledge of other types of foods for substitutions. They should be using real plates and silverware, or using all biodegradable/compostable things.\n\nAnd they should not be insulting our intelligence. Needless to say, I'm not going back.

(More like every morning, but I'm trying to make myself feel better here!) Well, Greens and Proteins is definitely a step in the right direction!! I met a girlfriend here one afternoon for a quick lunch and I was definitely in love!  We both got smoothies and split one of their breakfast options.  I was definitely satisfied by the end of our meal!  \n\nI got their acai smoothie and I loved it!  It wasn't as thick as some smoothie places make their smoothies and I was definitely happy about that!  It was the perfect flavor and consistency.  AND, it filled me up!  Now, I'm a hungry, hungry hippo, so I usually need a lot more than a smoothie to satisfy my hunger.  But not here!  My appetite was completely satisfied and I had to force myself to split the frittata with my friend.  Which was also delicious!!! \n\nThis is definitely an amazing healthy alternative in the area and I can't wait to go back and try even more!"

I got to try out their vegan pizza and some of their smoothies at a yelp event, and loved them all!  The peanut butter chocolate smoothie is crazy rich and sweet and would make a great dessert -- but it's still full of fruits and veggies! How do they do it?  I totally dug the vegan pizza - lavash crust with plenty of Daiya plus roasted peppers, kalamata olives and basil. \n\nI returned for a wellness shake (green veggies magically blended with ginger and other delicious items) that felt healthy but  tasted like a treat.\n\nFor lunch today, I tried the vegan burger with tofu fries.  I love these tofu fries!! They are actually more like vegan chikin fingers? nice-sized slabs of 'fu coated in a light batter, deep-fried and sprinkled w/ paprika.  I added a bit of salt and hot sauce, then they were perfect!  The burger comes on a whole wheat bun, but has no condiments.  They need some Vegenaise up in there, stat.  The burger was quite tasty and I left full and happy for ~$10 including tax and tip.\n\nThe juices are a bit pricy (~$7), but not so bad if you use them as a meal replacement.  Also you can check in on the Yelp app for iPhone and get $1 off juices and smoothies!\n\nAs a bonus for dine-in guests, they have DELICIOUS water. I'm not crazy! They make a sort of agua fresca with cucumbers and lemons, and it is damn good and so refreshing! Perfect for washing down your healthy items."

The bison burger was cooked perfectly; juicy and flavorful.  The fired tofu was excellent--I never thought bean curd could be made to taste so good--I had to remind myself I was actually eating tofu.  And the green ginger limeade was surprisingly tasty--light with a hint of ginger; not too sweet at all.  I will definitely be back to try the ostrich burger and fried jicama."

Your food is ready and usually less than five minutes and it's hot and delicious.\nIf you're looking for someplace that's not deep-fried and not slathered in sauces, come here you won't be disappointed.\nThe reason for the four stars instead of the five is that I think their dining area could use a little bit more revamping.

You can also get 1/2 salad, which is nice if you are not too hungry.  I would go there just for the free cucumber/lemon water!!  It is so delicious and refreshing."

            "review": "Not organic enough, not gluten free enough.  A tiny bit vegan friendly as long as you eat any old vegetables, and most vegans don't. We pay attention. My regular cities where I dining are NYC and LA so by comparison it may have led to me be harsh with only two stars because for vegas this place might be a three or four star but for overall healthy food restaurants coast to coast it is a solid 2 star. My preferred combo of gluten free and vegan was too much for this place. That's normal. So, Conscious eaters need not apply. I was drawn in by the name because it sounded like something on Abbot Kinney - the hippest spot in Venice, CA. It's not truly a healthy food restaurant if you're actually into ACTUAL health food. If you're in transition from Chili's, Subway, TGIF's etc then this is a great stepping stone to Whole Foods or the vegan menu at the Wynn. The young guy behind the counter was not interested in my questions to determine what I could eat that had no eggs and no gluten. The answer \"Not sure\" when I ask if something has eggs or gluten is a bit of a lame response. The answer to what I could eat there was nothing so it didn't really matter anyways after all. My friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza for takeout and devoured it, but since he regularly eats at Jack in the Box and McDonald's taking his word for quality food feedback is hardly realistic. In fact, his diet was so foul we had to cut way back on the hanging out. TMI. Still, people who go here seem to be enjoying it and the smoothie though not organic, that I took one tiny sip of, was pretty good. If you're not crazy picky about what you eat you'll love it and if you're a food snob keep driving."

(I split two meals between my girlfriend and me: the tofu chorizo breakfrast burrito and the veggie wrap.) I really dig a place that purports to be fresh and healthy *and actually is*. There were little things that made the experience better, as well. The staff was obviously very happy and interested in their food, our satisfaction, etc. It didn't feel forced, they actually seemed happy to be there and like they cared what we thought. And this might sound lame, but we didn't order drinks, and they proactively offered water cups to us, and then we saw that the water was nor just a fountain-style plain water but rather a cucumber/lemon water concoction that tasted great.\n\nThe only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 is that it IS a bit pricey. Our two meals, without drinks, came to $20. And the second time I went I got a medium-ish sized smoothie for more than $8. But I feel like that's worth it for what we got: indisputably fresh, healthy meals.\n\nI'll be going back regularly."

I'll explain more later and how the amazing girl Savannah professionally put him in his place. \n\nFirst the food: I've never really eaten in this restaurant but my HCG diet told me about their amazing prepared meals they have Which are 10$ and weigh out the 4 ounces of meat with 2 cups of acceptable veggies. So good!!! \n\nROID RAGE guy... So there was a crazy roid rage maniac who interrupted me as I was paying for my 4 meals to go... He said, \"ummm.. Scuse me miss.. I'm in a hurry and trying to pay and get out of here. So if you don't mind..\" Then he proceeds to try and cut me...by stepping in front of me... You can tell he worked out but was super Aggro. Angry and very rude. Then he was rude to Savannah... The sweet lady checking us out. He did this AS I was paying... The amazing cashier Savannah stepped in and quickly put him in his place. Then....\n\nHE TRIED to start a FIGHT!:: Then he started to try and start a fight with me and my BF as he was leaving. Saying, \"fuck you\" and motioning for us to go outside to 'fight' him... Let me repeat this interaction above was ALL that happened. It was so bizarre. I said why is he so angry?? Then I asked the cashier and all of the employees said he's rude every day... \n\nIt got me to thinking. Although my BF and I ended up paying close to 70$ before we left.. Maybe more.. (because we ordered food for lunch and dinner tomorrow)... And I will probably eat the majority of my next months meals here... Even if this guy is a customer EVERY day.. He should NOT be allowed to be in here and wreck our experience. His rudeness was all my BF and I spoke about all dinner. I hope the owners read this and although my food and experience with the workers here has been great.. They should rectify this situation by banning this guy because I really am dreading have to run into him again... It's giving me anxiety about coming in.. And if every employee knows him I'm sure if they read this they will know exactly who I am talking about. \n\nOther than that guy... My experience here is amazing. I've lived in LA forever and they really GET this whole healthy living lifestyle thing. I commend them, LOVE this restaurant and will recommend this to anyone. I now have my BF hooked. I also wish there was a reward program as I've now gotten about 7 HCG meals and will keep coming. Such a great restaurant. Great job GREENS & PROTEINS!!!"

I really was just eating because I was hungry as fuck and also I spent a stupid amount of money on a juice so I felt obligated to finish it. I did have a $1 off juice/smoothie coupon for checking in when I got there but $7.50 for a juice is a little insane.\nMy friend got a veggie tofu wrap thing with tofu fries and we shared that and the smoothie. My other friend got a broccoli cheddar soup. \nThe wrap was kind of weird. A lot of veggies (duh) but super bland for me. I had to put some ketchup on it. The fries were alright, super strange but the dipping sauce was delicious. My friend claimed to really enjoy the wrap and faux fries. I was pretty meh about them. \nMy Most Expensive Juice Ever was ok. It tasted kind of weird and looked downright nasty. My friend thought it was ok too. But for that much money I was expecting a strawfull of heaven or top shelf scotch at least, not just an \"ok\" drink.\nMy other friend got one whole piece of broccoli in his soup, that lucky man. He ate really slow and when we left he still had like half a bowl sitting there. He and I were both still hungry as fuck when we left. So that was a bummer.\nAlso- some guy in line next to me described the menu perfectly: \"can you not decide what you want because everything looks so good, or because nothing stands out to you? I'm the latter.\" That sums it up."

I knew what I wanted to order so I went straight to the register to place my order (1 Apple Pie Smoothie).  The two female employees prepping ingredients continued to chit chat with themselves, not acknowledging my presence for a full minute of standing at the register.  Finally one came over and took my order, my name, and payment.  The other employee started working on my smoothie.  I watched her pour in almond milk and then dump at least a CUP of nutmeg in my smoothie and gasp 'Oh my God' to the other employee.  (A little sprinkle of nutmeg goes a long way).  The two of them decided it best her her to  scoop the nutmeg out with her gloved hands.  Unsuccessfully, she decided to start my smoothie over (thankfully, as I watched her like a hawk, regretting having just paid $8 for a smoothie).  Meanwhile the other employee helped the two customers behind me as I watched employee 1 take her sweet a$$ time re-making my smoothie.  The other employee managed to make FOUR other smoothies (for customers behind me) in the time it took employee 1 to make one smoothie.  This all took about approx 10 minutes.  Then, employee 1 tried to give my smoothie away to another customer behind me.  I finally walked up and said, \"that's for (my name), right?\" \"Oh oops, here you go!\" was her response to me.  No 'sorry about the 10 minute wait'.  Sorry Greens & Proteins, no matter how hungry I am and how hard it is to get a healthy snack when I'm all the way across town, I will faithfully use my own Blendtec at home and make better, cheaper smoothies.  And I\"ll make sure to tell my friends."

            "review": "Best smoothies in Las Vegas, - whether you are vegan or not, these are unvelivable and very healthy, and not loaded with disguised names for sugars like turbinado, cane sugar,  etc. Although they do have honey and /or agave in them so you can ask for that to be omitted, you wont miss it. I love their green shake and their chocolate peanut butter banana shake personally.\nThey sneak in things like zucchini, and kale, and other very healthy foods and i swear you do not taste them! \nAlthough i have gone there many times for the smoothies i will admit I have eaten there only twice, neither was memorable for the price, i give them credit for making a difference to give people healthy options, but for example ...the tofu fries are not healthy, they are just deep fried tofu sticks The daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza is good compared to some places versions of it, but the only way to make it truly vegan(unless you want it served on a raw cracker) is to get it on the gluten free crust, after you substitute the crust you are getting charged 14.99 , otherwise if you dont mind the raw crust its 11.99 -in my opinion it is rather small and can be inhaled in just a few bites, i say its 8 inches at most and very thin. Not a great value -If you do the \"build your own custom meal\" they let you pick 1 protein, 1 vegetable, and 1 grains, not a great value, the plate is very very small.. although healthy tasting and not oily to try to make it taste better. but by the time you lunch and the smoothie you are looking at 20.00 minimum and you wont be full after.\nAnother issue i find is it can be very busy at lunch time, and they only ever have 1 person working the cash register, the line up can go out the door and the seats are all taken during these rushes. , combine that with people asking questions about the menu and being indecisive (me included)I think they should get at least 1 more register to get things running more smooth."

I also enjoyed looking around at their cute outdoor interior and exterior decor feel with their unique looking glossy lumber block tables. They have a huge variety of food items from vegan options, create your own meal, and  several different ingredients of lettuce, vegetables, herbs, meats offered from dish to dish.  I guess on the down side (not that it's a bad thing) the wide selection of menu options can seem a bit overwhelming.  I ordered the wellness drink with extra pineapples.  The drink was good, however a little on the watery side (maybe from extra pineapple and it being a smoothie and not a fresh squeezed juiced drink).  I also ordered the harvest kale stocked salad which I highly recommend to anyone who likes a lot of flavor and fruit in your salad.  I'm not a big salad person but the staff recommended this particular salad as his personal favorite and I was so glad he did because it did not disappoint!  We also ordered the salmon ceviche which was ok, however in my opinion lacked heat (I like spicier foods) guess I should've added hot sauce.  I love ceviche but probably won't get this again."

When we arrived to place our order they only had one. Oh well...we decided to go with the Tofu Soyrizo Spinach wrap. We still had money left over and was going to get the Tortilla soup but it was considered a lunch item and not part of the groupon deal. \n\nWe asked the cashier what else on the breakfast menu is vegan? He said the oatmeal, parfait and our wrap. We just had oatmeal that morning so we weren't in the mood. We double checked with him if the parfait is vegan because it said \"yogurt\" on the menu. He said yes, so we assumed it was a soy or coconut base...Oh HELL NO!! We later found out after taking several bites, me running to the restroom all night and calling them back that it had dairy. Not a happy girl. \n\nThis point I would give them a hater review but the wrap was actually good. Maybe it was a training error on the managers part. \n\nI would recommend the Tofu Soyrizo wrap. It was very flavorful. Right amount of \"sauce\", preventing it from being dry. The added side  of tofu fries compliments the wrap. \n\nVegan-avoid the parfait and Everyone else-definitely order the parfait. Although we were \"snaked\" the granola and the large amount of yogurt and fruit can make this a fulfilling meal."

I decided to have the frittata with turkey and fontina cheese and it was delicious. It was served with a salad with watermelon. The portion was generous and  I cant wait to return again. 7th I was so happy to have a reuseable plastic plate and silverware which is nice not to eat off of paper etc...\n\nAs far  as ambiance, it is all open air, it is very casual.

I love visiting restaurants that offer fresh healthy food, even though it means I'll probably spend a pretty penny on simple food.   \n\nMy girlfriend and I split the large \"Skinny Chef Salad\" ($9.99) and the \"Green Shake\" ($7.50).  Our total came out to $18 and some change all together.  Now, I don't mind spending a decent amount of money on quality food, but for a $10 salad I expected more turkey, ham and kale.  The salad had like six small cubes of turkey, I assume it was  because that's what it said on the menu.  Although it tasted like cubes of chicken...so I'm not sure which of the two it was, but I like chicken, so no big deal if it was chicken.  It also listed ham as a being a component to the salad, but I did not see any pieces of ham in the salad.  Lastly, I wish there was half kale and half romaine lettuce.  In reality it was about 70% romaine to 30% kale.  It also had swish cheese, one hard boiled egg, cucumber, and tomato (not listed on the menu as an ingredient).  \n\nAlthough, lacking in protein and kale, the salad was tossed in a delicious \"agave dijion Aioli.\"  It had a heavy note of horseradish which I really enjoyed.  Don't order this dressing if you're not a fan of horseradish though, because it's strong for sure.  Thumbs up on the unique, tasty dressing!  I would order this again for sure.\n\nThe shake was really tasty and filling, it deserves five stars, even if it was overpriced, in my opinion.  The \"green shake\" contained, *taking a deep breathe*, banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, and agave nectar.  Now that is what I call a shake!!  I love the variety in this shake, and guess what....you can't taste the veggies at all.  It tasted like a simple banana smoothie and I liked it.  I liked it a lot.   \n\nHere's a list of some other observations:\n-The restaurant is clean and bright.\n-The line to order was 4 or 5 people deep when I arrived, but it went quickly.  \n-The wait for our food was short. \n-The menu lists CALORIES CONTENT.  \n-The menu has a lot of variety.  It offers juices, smoothies, salads, unique drinks with caffeine, soups, small plates, pizzas, burgers, wraps and sandwiches. Phew!  If that wasn't enough, you can even \"build your own custom meal.\"\n-One of the staff said \"Have a great day\" on our way out the door.  Although simple, it was appreciated. \n\nI kept going back and forth in my mind on whether I should say 3 (basing my rating on price), or 3.5, or 4 stars.  I came to the conclusion that Greens and Proteins deserves a solid 4 stars, too bad it's so far from my home.  So minus half a star for not having a location on the west side and minus half a star for the price.   This type of restaurant is rare in Las Vegas, and I wish there were more like it."

It's not uncommon for me to find moldy berries in my \"summer berry salad\" or hair in my food from and an employee with hands in their hair. I've seen employee's prepping food and taking calls on the phone, using the register with gloves on, answering the to go phone with gloves on then keeping those gloves on to prep food. The menu is good, and the food can be good if there's no hair or moldy berries,  but the people who work there need to be re-trained with health code standards. Also, I notice they get  to go orders wrong (which is obviously annoying) and charge a few bucks higher for the same order than the west location, and when I inquire as to why, sometimes they correct the value and sometimes they don't. I think it's embarrassing to argue about a buck or two with and employee who is just a kid and looks at you like are you seriously arguing about a buck or two.... But, yeah, why is there a price difference? I don't want to be charged more from the same order when I eat at both locations a few times a week. Sometimes they charge you for cheese sometimes they don't stuff like that. I think the place has great potential but staff has room for improvement and need training both in procedure and health standards. This review is based on my experiences at the Eastern location."

If a business has to advertise that, they are trying too hard.\n\nMaybe we have high standards because we are from California where we know what good, clean Vegan food actually is. When we walked in the manager/server (?) jumped up and said \"Hello, Welcome\", then went back to leaning over the front counter with his phone in his face. Everything seemed okay while ordering at the counter. The realization that I was in a gross place started when I went to pour water. Tap water from the Coke machine. What \"health\" oriented  business has anything to do with the Coca-Cola company (FYI: corrupt evil corporation). Any truly healthful food restaurant knows what clean/pure water is. Not this place.\n\nWhen my Veggie Burger arrived the GF bun was SO DRY and starchy it was like eating stale duck feed. And it's not just my bun, my husband had a standard wheat bun with his veggie burger. I went to the sidebar to check out the condiments like ketchup and mustard: SYSCO. If the basic condiments are SYSCO with high fructose corn syrup, just imagine the rest of the ingredients in the kitchen, and their source. Some of the reviews here say \"I'm glad they use high-quality ingredients\", that is not possible if their main supplier is SYSCO. We asked for another ketchup or condiment option that did not have High Fructose Corn Syrup from the server/mangaer. He said that was all they had. Lame.\nThe Veggie patty was bland beans. The Tofu \"fries\" were so fried there was no tofu left in the middle, shriveled and soaking in oil. Gross.\nThe Thai ginger soup I got was like a think gloppy pudding. I tried putting it on my burger like a condiment to make it more edible. Didn't help. \nMy son got the GF Veggie pizza, the only thing flavorful on the table, because it was drenched in oil. \nIf you have HEALTH standards, are Vegan or Gluten-Free, I would NOT recommend this place. It is a cheap chain, with rip-off prices. \nUnfortunately, we left half of our food on the plate uneaten, walked out highly disappointed and feeling sick and gross from the quality of food."

I ordered the bison patty with kale and sweet potato mash, and the lump crab and avocado lettuce cups.

I tried the bison cheesesteak with tofu fries and I guess I was hoping for a little more flavor in the bison other than just salt...really it's a chopped up bison burger patty put in a wrap.  The tofu fries were all the rave on the reviews...but in comparison to the Chinese salt and pepper tofu squares...they were quite lack luster and dry in my opinion. The service seems like it could be refined, the couple that we ate with got a number with their order, while we did not.  The server seemed to wander from table to table asking what people ordered in order to deliver food.  The decor was bright and refreshing and the Hawaiian music in the background made it good environment for a Sunday lunch.  I probably won't be venturing back to this restaurant anytime soon, but I think the location near LVAC and perhaps for the calorie and health conscious this place is a win."

Two weeks ago my wife and I were looking for a new place to try, and  she brought up this place.  I thought I would give it a shot, event though I expected it to be a tofu and salad type place.  When we walked into the restaurant I was met with surprise...\n\nThis place is not that just a vegetarian place.  They have a rather large menu with a mix of meat, fruits and vegetables.  They have everything from your staple foods such as chicken and beef, to exotic foods like bison and ostrich.  My wife had the bison lettuce burger which was very flavorful. My favorite aspect of this restaurant is the custom meal which allows you to pick from a number of meats ranging from poultry to fish to beef.  The meal also allows you to pick a vegetable, which there are several to choose from, a grain (also several choices), and a sauce of your choice.  I got the chicken with mixed greens, quinoa, and balsamic dressing.  Everything about the meal was excellent.  It was so good that my wife and I have eaten there 4 more times in the past two weeks.  It has become one of our favorite places to eat now.  We have also tried their smoothies with are very good as well.\n\nThe decor in this place is very cool, and their are a lot of outlets for electronic devices, which makes this place a great place to study or just go to get work done.

I had dinner here on Monday night with a vegan friend and it certainly has that SoCal, clean and green vibe going on.  The staff is super friendly and greeted us warmly as we perused the menu.  I'd already looked it up online prior to arriving and I just cannot believe their smoothies and wellness drinks cost so much!  You need a healthy wallet to drink healthy there!  Even with a Yelp check-in that gives you a $1 off, I still could not justify spending even $6.50 for a smoothie.  So, I went with the turkey club in a wheat wrap with tofu fries.  The wrap was great and the tofu fries were...interesting.  I just kept wishing they were real fries, but I did say I TRY to eat healthy.  My friend had the vegan pizza and she loved hers, but she also is a regular customer and has a much healthier wallet than I do.  I find it interesting that this joint which promotes health and wellness also advertises that it has an HCG-friendly menu--isn't HCG unsafe, illegal, and not approved by the FDA?  Anyway, overall, if you're vegan, vegetarian, or want to take a walk on the healthier side, come to Greens and Proteins.  They certainly live up to their name!"

Plus, the environment is modern and clean with TV viewing options to boot. Alas, the only sadness is that it is located on the opposite end of town, which means my visits are limited. \n\nAt the time of this review, you still get $1 off a smoothie when you check in on Yelp, so put your app to work! They have a wonderful ginger concoction, but on our last visit we went with the Wellness Drink, and it was a mean green delicious machine. It is worth stopping in just for a quality beverage. \n\nAs for the eats, one of my favorite treats here are the tofu fries. I realize they may sound like a disgrace to the original almighty french fry, but as a french fry lover, I am here to say if you like tofu, you will love these. They are perfectly proportioned and lightly seasoned. Do they taste like a french fry, no? But, they do taste like you want to eat another and another and another... \n\nMy husband has ordered the bison wrap twice, and on my last visit, I went with a \"Build Your Own Meal\" combo. You get a choice of a protein, a vegetable, a grain and a sauce. I had turkey breast, mixed green salad, and cous cous with a balsamic reduction. I ate every last bite and didn't feel guilty. I love that you can get a complete meal that is healthy and affordable without all of the pomp and circumstance that goes along with a full service restaurant. (Greens is a counter service spot where you take a number.)\n\nThey also offer healthy pizzas and options for vegetarians and vegans. However, don't be fooled, it isn't a vegan restaurant. There is plenty o' meat!"

I love feta but, the kalamata olives were toooo over powering. My roomie had to take them outta his pizza; and he loves olives.\n\nChecking into Yelp gave me a 50 cent off voucher on their shakes or juices so, we decided to get one. I forget which one but, it was delicious. Peanut buttery but, not toooo thick.

I asked the girl at the register what she recommended and/or the most popular dish, she didn't have much to say except asking me what I was hungry for..  I wanted to know what there top seller was, no answer. At that point another woman interjected and took over my order. \n\nFor my husband, I ordered the Turkey Club as a wrap. For myself, I ordered the Grilled Vegetable wrap. I mentioned I eat a lot of grilled vegetable sandwiches, which she replied but you haven't had ours .... I did have it today, and will not be ordering it again. The wrap was soggy.. not much flavor to the vegetables that were not crunchy but overcooked. The beans were tasty along with the cilantro pesto, however there was only a dab or two put on it. \n\nFor the sides, with a choice between tofu fries or jicama, I went with something different, tofu fries... different indeed.. I love tofu, but these were shaped like fish sticks and had the seasoning and taste of fish sticks you had as a child (not pleasant)\nNext time, I'll go for the jicama. The woman that took my order, did say the sauce that you dip them in is good, and yes it was... I ended up putting it on my bland grilled veg. wrap. \n\nI also ordered the Thai Ginger soup, which I was told was made from scratch. \nIt was flavorful, but could have used some salt to bring out the flavor more.. A little thick for a hot afternoon. \n\nI tasted my husbands Turkey Club and it was tasty. Maybe I'll order that the next time. \n\nThe service was nice and friendly.. I will go back and give it another try... \nFor a first time experience,  today's meal proved to me that if it good for you, then it doesn't taste good."

I ordered build your own plate - chicken, steamed broccoli, and basmati rice. They served uncooked rice?  And the broccoli was not steamed at all? Hmmm... something must be off the night I came in. Regardless, if I was the manager, or the person expediting the food, I will make sure the food is made right. Uncooked rice? Not okay. And then the server asked me, should we make you another one? No, sir, I've got somewhere to go.\n\nI should have demanded my money back."

I can tell you that every location the food has been spot on. They have a nice diversity of healthy options, whole create your own menu section, options for smoothies really enjoy, and never had bad meal. I ended up getting the Turkey Club Wrap with tofu fries. I think might have been the first time getting wrap. The best parts about it was instead of the normal wrap went with the spinach wrap. Talk about giving the wrap not only different flavor and look! I thought was prefect compliment for the whole dish. It had ample amount of turkey and love the dressing mixed in with the greens some fresh tomato. It nice size wrap one that filling. The tofu fries. Fried tofu especially hard tofu. Beautiful thing. It not only healthier but taste better then fries, Not at all greasy. It crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could order whole basket of fries if I cold. The seasoning they out on the tofu is addicting.\n\nYou can tell not only from the sign that just opened plus get first review. LOL! It feels new, smells new, and things that tradition with the signage and logo. I believe this is the only location that the menu its electronic. I know the smoothies looked even more tasty. It rolls over couple times or least once. Each time keep showing different smoothie on the menu. It making me thirsty waiting or thinking about what am going order for lunch. I like the menu. They sell different nutrition bars Q-West bars to couple other brands. The cucumber water nice touch. Me not really fan of but hear it not only healthy but not many places that offer it. I would say probably about the same size as the other two locations. \n\nThe service nothing but five stars for me. They greeted us right after entering, offered help with the menu if needed it, friendly, and love the positive vibes. The best part about third location is super close to the house. So now truly if ever need Greens and Proteins fix literally bike down the street or five min drive. Nice option too have in life!! =))))"

The other detail I'm not crazy about is the kale salad.  Since it's mature kale, it's a bit tough, and it would be nice if they used baby kale or chopped it up a bit more.

Even though we arrived about 30 minutes before closing, we were still treated like \"priority\". We were never \"rushed\" and the food was made and served fresh!!! The entire staff was warm and friendly!!!\n\nI love the healthy options available to vegetarians & non-vegetarians. I eat meat so the fact that they offer great tasting burgers in bison and Angus is great!! \nI had the Choco-Banana Smoothie...sinfully delicious without the \"guilt\"!! They add kale, spinach & avocado which \"works\" with the rest of the traditional ingredients (chocolate, banana and peanut butter)\n\nI ordered the Angus burger with avocado and cheddar cheese, which was perfectly cooked & juicy!! The sweet potato fries were good n crispy!!\n\nSteve-o not only treated us to great customer service, but gave my friend and I tasting samples of the acai smoothie, walnut pesto sauce with crackers to dip with and refreshing cucumber water!! \n\nGreens n Proteins...you won a returning customer & a fan!!! Delicious and nutritious!!"

So since I was working in this area today  I thought to myself let me just grab some lunch from greens and proteins since I know what I like already. So I order my usual which is a teriyaki sandwich and sweet potato fries. I open it in the car cause I was starving and their sweet potato fries are usually so hot,crispy, and delish but this time I grab one and its just wet and soggy and limp.   Anyways I have hope and I'm like maybe it's a one off situation but nope when I get to my desk 5 mins later  and open my food all my fries are wet and soggy and my sandwich was broken and a mushy mess. (Mind you I didn't even pick it up still and this never happened at the Decatur location.) this was super disappointing especially since I spend a few extra bucks for quality. If it wasn't about health and quality I would just give my business elsewhere. Therefore as of now I'll stick to eating here when I'm around the Decatur location because I have been their consistently and have not had a bad experience."

The flavor is amazing all the while not as messy as one would have expected. A good mix of ingredients overall making the tofu really blend in. \n\nAs always the tofu fries are the best part. \n\n\"Green Ginger Limeade\" - very fresh and refreshing, could practically taste each individual ingredient. \n\n \"Watermelon Strawberry Cocktail\" - not as refreshing as I would've expected, the strawberries tasted almost like preserved ones.

It has only been a couple of weeks since this location opened up and I have to say that they have been doing a great job accommodating to the clientele, This location is near a business center where major companies are located including: William Hill, Hakkassan and multiple law firms and physician firms. This location is busy! It may not be near a gym unlike the other two locations, but it is still pretty busy. I am impressed with the way the staff is working so hard to maintain great service for a new spot that has barely opened for less than a month. I have to give a shout out to Daniel and the rest of the team who constantly give their best to making a great dining experience!\n\nI have been to the other locations and I have to say that the serving size in the location seems more than the other two. I feel like I am actually getting my money's worth here! I love building my own menu or ordering the food from the menu. The service, the food and the quality is consistent from the other two locations. There has never been a bad experience with me from the food or service. I am very happy that there is finally a location near where I live and where I work!\n\nSo far, this location is working very hard for a business to open up less than a month. Service is great, food tastes delicious and is consistent throughout. I know I will continuously go here!"

I'm a fan of their Flamingo location since I'm trying to trim down and eat clean. I like coming here since this spot gives me options to choose from outside of ordering salads. On my last trip, I ordered their Green Ginger Limeade (green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, and opted out of the addition of Stevia). I make green smoothies at home and haven't thought of this combo. It's naturally sweet and green grapes and ginger tone down the addition of spinach. It's a quick and tasty way to get your fruits and veggies in.  I loved the blend of flavors and strong ginger kick. \n\nThis spot isn't just for smoothies or fresh juices. They offer up a health conscious menu - sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads and more clean eating grub. I've sampled their bison burger and chicken satay in the past and both have  been tasty options. The have a prime Southwest location and may be found within the shopping center (same one as Starbucks, Cracked Egg and Archie's) on the corner of Sunset and S. Rainbow.  I really enjoy having the option of grabbing a nutritious treat around the corner from our office. My coworkers and I have secured this spot as part of our lunch rotation. \n\n\n."

The tofu fries were delicious!! Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- definitely not starchy like potatoes but they were good. The seasoning on the outside of the fries was delicious! It wasn't too salty or too spicy or anything but just right. The strawberry watermelon drink I had had a scoop of protein in it and it made it into a creamy shake- perfect as a dessert and a way to get fruits and protein into my body after the workout. Stephan had the margarita pizza and it was delicious too. The crust was nice and crispy and the sauce and cheese to pizza ratio was on point. \n\nPrice wasn't too bad, the 6 pieces of tofu fries are $2.00 and the plateful of jicama fries are $4.00. Not bad considering I don't have to chop and peel to eat jicama. My smoothie drink was I think $5.99 but I added whey protein so it was an extra dollar.

The meat is juicy and every bite is delicious. It comes with either jicama fries or tofu fries. We are not jicama fans so we get the tofu fries and they are yummy."

Great salads, and even better juices, with a friendly staff and a casual atmosphere.  I always feel weird about leaving dirty dishes on a table in a fast casual restaurant like this, but I'm warming to the idea.  Summer Berry Spinach Salad, Harvest Kale Stocked Salad, and Bison Cheese Steak are current faves.  Try a Wellness Drink or a Green Ginger Limeade, and you too will be a happy, healthy human!"

Why isn't there one of these on every corner like Starbucks.\n\nThis place has a full kitchen of all organic amazing foods and has a full juice and smoothie bar to boot.\n\nWhen you walk in the door you initially think it's just a juice and smoothie bar and then you take your first breath and realize that smell is intoxicating. You order right there at the counter for the smoothie and the juice bar. Everything is extremely fresh and made to order. So if you want to get a smoothie and someone you're with it wants to grab lunch this is the perfect place to be. There is a pretty simple area to sit and had your lunch, which they bring out to you! Awesome! However the food is a bit on the pricey side. But the quality is worth every penny.\n\nI would beg and plead Reno to open one at home, but I guess until then I'll have to frequent the few locations they have an Vegas.\n\nI recently men's this to greens AND protein lovers alike."

Not to say all foodies are, but I am.\n\nI've wanted to try one of these health driven food places and decided on Greens & Proteins and the staff definitely made my visit. They were taking dine in orders when they were closing in 10 minutes. That's awesome. Disclaimer: I wasn't the jerk coming in 10 minutes before closing: I was leaving.\n\nI tried their famous tofu fries with special dipping sauce and a bowl of turkey chili that night.\n\nThe first thing that popped in my head was how big the portions were. $5 for 12 tofu fries and $5-$7 for a giant bowl of chili. I took my leftover soup home and it legit filled the take out cup. The chili was the perfect balance of being unique, healthy, and tasty. After I was done I felt fine full but in a pleasant way as the soup wasn't loaded with sodium as most soups tend to be. \n\nWith all that said this fatty felt like this place was approachable. They have a lot of similar items on their menus as other healthy casual dining places in the Vegas valley like wraps, juices, smoothies, and grilled chicken. They also have some stuff that someone who wasn't eating a healthy diet would find appealing.\n\nThe prices are affordable, really clean, friendly staff, plenty of seating- I dig it."

If you check in on yelp you get $1 a juice or smoothie. The person who helped us out...Steve? was great. Very personable and gave great recommendations.\n\nStill waiting for this place to come out to LA!"

I went at breakfast loved the greek scramble, a bit bummed on just black coffee no creamer or substitute for creamer but they have a nice selection of special caffeine and non caffeine drinks. My husband got the burrito and enjoyed it with a peanut butter bananna smoothie shocker he couldent taste the kale or spinach in it thats a bonus for him. My daughter enjoyed a turkey burger. Overall great food will definitely be back."

I was greeted by a bunch of smiling, happy associates. Props to the manager because everyone had a great attitude. The young guy Alex at the register had great recommendations and I told him to \"take the wheel\" and order something he thought I would enjoy.. and boy did I! He set me up with a Bison Wrap and some sweet potato fries. It was delish, mad props to Alex for the hook-up. Ambiance is nice; lots of people on work breaks or fresh out of the gym, chatting happily over their meals. \nI will definitely be back soon!"

Once learned about there newest location excited about chance too get my Greens and Proteins on. I no means hardcore comes too healthy eating but generally try all my meals healthy. Truly is no place better in Vegas comes too healthy menu. Literally they breakdown the calories on just about every menu item. Offer Build Your Own Custom Meal pick your proteins, greens, grains, and sauces. Again they have everything broken down too calories. It was my first time daunting too pick choose as my first taste. I kind of in the mood of burger so went with the Ostrich Burger and try so got the 7 Vegetable Broccoli Cheese Soup. \n\nThe soup was good. It nothing Wow factor but overall solid soup. It nice creamy base soup but had nice thickness and full body with the cheese (assume cheddar they use. The color really nice. Times order any vegetable soup not have that vibrant or look like vegetable. Soup was right on. Nice HOT!!\n\nThe Ostrich Burger was delicious. I believe one first times having it. It lean meat. So thinking might be dried out but still moist and had nice flavor. The garnishes of lettuce and tomatoes really fresh looking added too my burger. The sides lot too choose from but went with the fried tofu. I scared at first. I enjoy tofu but not seasoned right just bland. The fried tofu was hit for me. It had nice seasonings on the outside and enjoy the aioli dipping sauce for them. They also offer Bison as protein. I see that in my future...\n\nThey cook everything too order so takes time but very much worth the wait. The only thing not fan of is the interior is REALLY boring. I understand still relatively new but plain white walls all around and not much of vibe inside. It loses appeal waiting but once you get your food more then MAKES up for it. It kind of pricey menu. Still not going too hold me back try more of the menu."

You can make your own meal, so you can try many different combinations of food and try things here that you wouldn't have otherwise.

Now the bison wrap, not bad, not great nothing special. The bison was again no flavor but noted this is a health food spot so understandable some sauce they provided made the wrap taste better and i ate it just fine.

I called from the parking lot, using my bluetooth, to place a to-go order, I was at the Lifetime fitness on Charleston and just finished my workout (11:45 am). Immediately I was asked if it was okay to put me on a brief hold. I was on hold for over 10 minutes, and by the time they picked up again I was standing right in front of the cashier. She seem annoyed at ME, which is ridiculous because it should be the other way around, and she said, \"our phones are not working properly.\" I placed my tuna salad and chicken quinoa salad and the cashier said in a condescending tone, \"well at least you do not have to wait long for your order because you are ordering salads.\" $19.00 + dollars and on top of it I tipped them 2.00 (which I should have not had I known what other crap I had to endure). Had it not been for the Seven magazine I was reading to occupy my time, I realized 15 minutes had passed and those who ordered after me were already eating or have left. I looked into the kitchen and the two cashiers were talking and \"looking busy.\" I see my salad order just sitting on the counter in the kitchen. I loudly say, \"Is that my salad order I have been waiting for?\" They looked at me as if I am the one being rude and look at the order like it appeared there magically. Since my husband had already had lunch he said he would eat the quinoa salad for dinner. I just got a call from him at 7:30 pm and he said there was GLASS in his salad. I called to inform this location what we had been through. Of course it is not the evening shifts fault and Priscilla, the supervisor I spoke to apologized and offered to buy us new meals but that is not what I want because I am NEVER going to this place again. The Greens and Proteins on Rainbow is closer to me and I usually go there. This was my second and LAST time going to the Flamingo location.

If you read my review of the Eastern location, I too gave them 5 stars.  However, it's easy to dismiss these posts as biased ones since there is so little reviews.  I had to investigate because that's what I do.   \n\nI am a fan of Greens & Proteins and one complaint about them is price.  Most of the items on the menu are pricey and to be honest, don't have much taste either.  Keep in mind, G&P is healthy and that includes you to have an healthy wallet. I'm not a baller by any means, but will splurge when quality proteins is what my body needs.  I also use to have food delivered to my home via \"Eat to Grow\".  This was pricey too and taste is only for the desirable.  I made my biggest gains on these meals and G&P is no different. \n\nI've tried their Salmon and Ostrich Burgers in the past.  At this location, I opted to try their Turkey.  You get 8 oz of clean protein and less fat with their Turkey Burger.  This meal is also served with their Jicama fries.  The turkey was pretty good, but the fries is something that made it into the basura with the quickness. After Lent, I will definitely come back for their Filet Mignon.  \n\nI gave the other location 5 stars, but had to drop this location to 4 stars.  This G&P is more spacious, but missing that ambiance that the Eastern location has. Great people watching at the Eastern location.  Because this location is new, the staff is also new.  Knowledge is power and a newbie staff can mean weakness.  When I order at places like this, I like to know how much the servings are like protein count, total ounces, etc.  The staff actually had to go to the back and ask.  They also didn't know if they served fat-free ranch.  I know, I'm just getting picky but these are the things most health driven restaurants would know.  I'm sure by the next visit, they'll be more prepared. Thus, I will probably up their rating back to 5 stars. \n\nStill a fan of Greens and Protein.  Don't be surprised if you see multiple check in's from me at this joint.  This is a new and more spacious location.  I'm sure within the next couple of months, the word will be out and the ambiance will mimic what the Eastern location provides."

            "review": "I saw this on my way into Zabbas last week and mentally bookmarked this place.  I am always down to try a new place that is supposedly healthy.   Wow, was I surprised.  In the first 48 hours I had eaten here for lunch, dinner and lunch again!\n\nWalking into the place was a little daunting.  This place was so busy that there was literally a line out the door.  All the tables were filled and we were worried we'd have nowhere to sit.  This place is very hectic loud like a high school cafeteria!   The floors are nicely tiled, the tables are high end wood, as are the chairs.  There are booths along a window that, if one can grab, are pretty comfortable to sit at.\n\nThe menu consists of Breakfast items (until 11am), Soups, Salads, Pizzas, BURGERS and Wraps/Sandwiches.  Calorie Counts are next to their popular items!  To drink, there is your standard coke fountain with a dedicated dispenser for WATER.  :)\n\nThe place is very busy, but still manages to be clean.  There are no trashcans in sight, you just leave your table and the staff quickly cleans up after you.\n\nThe first time out I ordered the Ostrich Burger with Swiss Cheese and Tofu Fries.  Despite the cost of being over $15 for my order, it was delicious and I felt it was well worth it.  The burger was a tiny bit dry, but delicious nonetheless.  Burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato and onion.  The tofu fries were unique.  I wasn't impressed at first but I later realized it was because the fries weren't cooked all the way and it was still squishy in the middle.  This meal I would rate a 8 out of 10.\n\nLater that night I came back again and the place seemed to be less busy.  This time I ordered the Turkey Wrap with bacon and a spinach tortilla and Jicama fries (it's like eating a raw apple sliced up like fries).  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I loved it - I was very impressed.\n\nOn to my next meal here at lunch:  This time I ordered the Bison Burger Swiss cheese, medium rare with Jicama Fries.  The burger was just the right amount of juicy absolutely incredible.   Where else can you eat a burger like this guilt free?  I also ordered a Green Leaf Berry Blast shake with almond milk.  It was very good and satisfied my cravings for fresh fruit.\n\nBe warned, however.  Buying a shake with one of their meals is like eating two meals in one.  I was completely stuffed by the end of my visit.\n\nToday for lunch I ordered the Turkey Burger with Swiss and half Jicama fries, half tofu fries.  To drink I got the Apple Pie Smoothie with Almond milk.  I was impressed with the burger.  Very juicy and tasty.  The Jicama fries are spot on.  Just like eating an apple again and served raw with paprika.  The Tofu fries this time however was even better than I remembered.  This is because they were actually cooked all the way through.  If I can get tofu fries prepared like this again, I think Jicama is in trouble!  On the other hand, the Apple Pie Smoothie left more to be desired. I am not a fan of this.\n\nI am sure to visit again to try the Bison Wrap with Spinach tortilla.  My friends have all been getting it, but before I settle into my \"norm\" i wanted to try as much as possible here.  If my norm is the bison wrap, so be it. :) \n\nThis place has definitely earned a solid top entry for my work lunch rotation.\n\nI am only giving four stars for a simple reason: the guy that took my order at the register the past two times doesn't seem very friendly at all. Not a smile; not even a forced smile - it's like I'm bothering him when ordered.  On top of that, I don't EVER get a receipt from him or even offered a water cup.  The other guy, who appears to be either a manager or owner is very friendly and helpful.\n\nOther suggestions to the owners if you are reading: You need more tables and seating - It appears the suite next to you is empty, consider expanding. :)"

If anything, all i noticed was the huge amount of mozzarella cheese on the pizza. They have different crusts you can pick. thin pizza crust (normal), lavash (a persian? flat bread?), and something else. Not sure what lavash was or the other one (and this was my friends pizza anyway but i was ordering/paying) so i decided to get the normal thin pizza crust. Flavor overall, like a normal margherita pizza. Only thing was i hope they can amp up the roasted garlic flavor (or maybe i can request for more/additional roasted garlic... XD garlic lover om nom nom) and the crust, maybe they can bake it longer. It was a little soft for my taste. The edge crust, it was nice and crispy, but anything under the toppings, was a little, floppy =X\n\nBison Cheese Steak Wrap (Red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato) - this order was for me. I thought it was quite interesting and ive never had bison before. something new to try for me. Comes with either a side of tofu fries or jicama fries and a pickle. The pickle was a normal pickle spear (yum). I opted for the tofu fries (curious but definitely not a stranger to tofu). Nicely fried. A little underseasoned but still tasted yummy (i like tofu anyway). As for the wrap, you get a choice of either a savoy cabbage wrap, wheat wrap, spinach wrap, or whole wheat bun. I opted for the spinach wrap. Overall, it looked decent and yummy. While i ate it, it was dripping a lot of juices/oil. Almost made it seem like this wrap was heavier/fattier than it really was. First experience in trying bison? uhm if i wasnt told it was bison, id almost call it beef. Overall, flavored well but a bit messy to eat (drippy drippy ....) Im not sure how healthy this wrap was but after eating it, i didnt feel so healthy. LOL  \n\nOverall, nice place. A bit on the pricey side. These two items added up to i believe around $24? I guess a price to pay for fresh/organic? ingredients. May try other things next time since i think i picked the fattiest item on the menu."

The HCG menu is simple; choose a protein & a veggie, they do the rest.  No measuring or worrying about how to prepare while sticking to the diet plan, they have it all figured out for me.  I ordered mine to go, shrimp & asparagus; it took about 15 minutes, and a guy brought it to my table. I had to take a peek once I made it to the car; wow!

My wife and I hold the green ginger limeade as a staple here. It's a perfect blend of ginger, limeade, and the vegetables a rancher would scoff at. Their food is always seasoned to a T. The grilled vegetable wrap is an awesome choice for those time meat does not not sound appealing, but for those that want to get their meat on, the bison burger will definitely full the void. My personal favorite is the California grille chicken wrap. Don't forget to get your tofu fries! I know that sounds weird to be screaming out loud, but trust me, their sauce definitely will make you a believer.\n\nThe place screams come here and study or chill if you feel like it.

I decided on the pizza. \n\nMy order came about 20 min later maybe even a bit longer which I think is too long for a fast casual restaurant. When I took the first bite of the pizza all I could taste was the BBQ sauce. While the BBQ sauce did grow on me after a few bites, I almost thought it tasted a little too unique. Additionally, if a \"traditional\" BBQ sauce is not used, the menu should specify the type of BBQ sauce being used (citrus BBQ sauce). Now on to the chicken, I did not like the spice on the chicken and it was a little dry. The positives were that the pizza is low calorie so you can finish the whole thing; the fat free ranch is delicious; the lavash bread gave the pizza a nice crunch.\n\nTowards the end of my meal, I called over the manager to give him some feedback. While I appreciated him sitting down with me and having an open conversation, I did not like the fact that he said normally I would offer a refund but in this case I don't think we did anything wrong. I wasn't asking for a refund just offering my honest feedback. \n\nOverall, I like the concept of the restaurant and I am willing to come back to try more items on the menu."

The menu has a wide variety including vegan items- I am not vegan but for some reason decided to order from the \"vegan side\" of the menu. The chicken lettuce cups were delicious!! Service was fast, friendly staff and kick ass cucumber water that's freeeeee! The banana split smoothie is the jam by the way. So happy I found a healthy place so close to me! Worth satin again that the staff was really nice and they all had smiles on their faces!"

This is the 2nd time we come here and both times I've been underwhelmed and disappointed with my food. The first time I ordered a grilled chicken teriyaki wrap and the chicken was practically burnt and there was no teriyaki sauce. I had to ask for extra to put it on myself. This time I ordered the summer berry salad with chicken and it was drowning in dressing and had like 5 berries with undercooked chewy chicken. My fountain drink was good though. This place is overrated BIG TIME.!!"

Polite over achievers, really happy smiling bunch. Giving us samples as we waiting for the previous family decide their order. \n\nGreen ginger lime juice was delicious. And a huge size compared to other similar joints. I got the turkey burger on wheat. Huge fresh patty grilled bun vegan cheese heirloom tomato not your average turkey burger. Tofu fries are very seasoned looking but not overwhelmingly spicy. Quite mild Could stand to bump up the heat a little even. Comes on a triangle plate which was fun. \n\nBf got the chicken satay. Delicious good size portion excellent plating. Complimentary cucumber water probably was the highlight of it all for me. Id come back just for that. Stiff uninviting tables when you dine in but they're surpringly comfortable."

I also ordered some broccoli soup, hummus/pita, and a Margherita pizza with the Vegan option. The shake was refreshing,filling, and delicious. The food however was just not my style. I saw other people enjoying their meals. I would say nothing was wrong with the food at all. It was made fresh and with good looking ingredients. I just think as of now, I'm more on a juicing/smoothie kick. The open plan of the kitchen was nice to be able to see your food being made in front of you. I liked the modern and clean look of the decor. There was a large patio to enjoy the spring/fall seasons here in Vegas. \nMy only gripe.. the noise level!\nBring earplugs.

The seasoning was good on them but I definitely wouldn't recommend them for takeout unless you are eating them immediately. (Duh) \n\nGot the bison burger because I read multiple reviews. I got mine with cheddar, turkey bacon, and avocado. So SO good!!! The flavor of this burger was amazing. Over a week after eating it and I'm drooling on the keyboard over this review. I didn't think I would get a burger of all things here but I am so happy I did! \n\nI love juices so I tried the green ginger juice (don't remember the exact name) it was probably the best juice I've ever purchased.

I was asked if I needed anything else after my food was delivered and I asked if silverware was in a specific area. The gentleman then offered to grab them for me instead.

However, the always cheerful welcome has been gone for a while, and tonight's carryout meal was a disappointment. The salmon was good, but the avocado portion was small and so full of brown spots that I wouldn't eat it. The watery mashed sweet potatoes were not tasty. Furthermore, the cashier closed the cash drawer with a hasty thanks and goodbye but without the change I was due. Until I see a string of favorable reviews I'm taking my smoothie business to the nearby smoothie restaurant, and my healthy meal business to the nearby protein restaurant. I'll be back at some point, with the hope of providing a more positive review."

Almost everyone who was here was in work out clothes haha. \n\nI tried the Margherita pizza and the Green Leaf Berry Blast. \n\nThe Margherita pizza was simple but delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella cheese and slices of tomato with bits of basil garnishing. I wish I had gotten the gluten free version though! - I really love how they have the gluten free option. The portion was probably good for sharing with one other person. \n\nThe smoothie was alright. The taste was leaning more towards the spinach and kale which I wasn't really fond of. I do love kale though but it was probably the spinach that was giving it a weird flavor. I'd give it a 3/5. \n\nThere was also complimentary cucumber water which was a refreshing touch. The place itself is pretty spacious and busy but the service was fast and the workers were very nice. I'm glad that this place is close by my neighborhood. I will definitely stop by again to try the other foods. They also have an ostrich burger which I don't think I'll be trying anytime soon lol."

Definitely not the healthiest things, but we were hungry... GAINZ. One thing I love about them is that they always have the cucumber water and it tastes so refreshing! We sat outside because the weather was nice and our meals did not take too long to make as well. The server brought it out to us and made sure we had everything that we needed. The bison burger was amazing! I got it medium rare and glad I did because you can feel the juices with every bite! They cooked it perfectly and it definitely tasted a lot cleaner than your usual burger. My girlfriend enjoyed her cheesesteak and took half of it home because the other half got her full. We got tofu fries as our side and I suggest anyone to get it! It's so good! The price range for the two items is around $10-$12 each I believe. Couldn't remember the exact price. Overall I prefer this over protein source as they have better tasting food! Price is about the same."

He was dismissive and after we ordered, I was sure they didn't prepare his food correctly. I order a albacore salad and it was just \"okay\".

I think it actually looks better than the one on eastern. The menu is pretty clear and precise. It ranges from green juices, green smoothies and then your food items. All the food items i would say are healthy, you can even get gluten free items or protein style for your burgers if you want.\n\nI ordered from the create your own menu. Basically you pick a protein, 1 side and a grain and your choice of sauce. I picked bison patty for my protein and sauteed spinach, and grilled onions for my sides instead of getting a grain. I also ordered a wellness drink.\n\nThe bison patty was cooked as ordered it didn't strike me as anything amazing. It was kind of bland and dry. I'm assuming it was bland because it was healthier. The spinach and the onions tasted exactly as they should nothing special but was expected. The wellness drink was actually my favorite of all the items ordered it tasted really good for all the green vegetables in it. It was actually really sweet so i think they probably put more juice in it to mask the vegetable taste.\n\nOverall place isn't bad but nothing special. One thing I must warn you about is, it is extremely overpriced! Looking at the prices i was surprised they charged so much for vegetables you can buy and make a whole weeks worth for the price the same price. \n\nSide note: there are also a lot of jacked up guys and girls in yoga pants that stop in because the LVAC is right next to it. So if you want to sit in and people watch it is a good place to do that."

It was on a large plate, with everything separate and not touching.  I felt like someone who had OCD fixed the plate.  I would've preferred a bowl where I could mix the things together with the sauce, since quinoa isn't exactly easy to get on a fork with chicken and avocado already on it.  Quinoa is also rather bland by itself.\n\nI also got the Thai Ginger soup, which was more like a thick yellow curry with nothing in it.  I love ginger, and couldn't really taste it in this soup, which was disappointing to me, as it's the reason I ordered it.\n\nI would honestly give this place 2.5 stars, more on the lines of \"meh\" than A-ok, and that's mainly because the service here was decent and the people working behind the counter were nice and helpful.

The cost was pricy. I get that you are paying for health but it would be far cheaper to buy some chicken , brown rice, and kale, put nothing on it and cook it! This is a fad but an expensive one!"

It's possible I ordered entirely the wrong thing, but it also took forever to come out (20 minutes), and then one of the containers exploded (opened) in the car and spilled salad all over the floor. \n\nThe bison burger, which I ordered medium, was way way way overdone. Well done in fact. It was flavorless, and the toppings were soggy even though they were separate from the burger. It came with jicama or tofu fries. I got the jicama fries. They were covered in chili powder. I'm not a fan of chili powder. I love jicama. I also got a caesar salad, which was itself actually good minus the exploding container. The little tub of dressing would not have been enough had I not lost half of the salad to the car floorboards, so that was a blessing in disguise. Burger and salad cost $11+5, fountain drink was $2 or $3. They also offer fancy healthy shakes/smoothies for $6-7. \n\nMenu not offered in a format other than 10 feet above the registers or glued to the counter at the register. Made it hard to figure out what to order since I couldn't read the options. :/"

I seem to have forgotten that healthy things don't taste as good as deep fried not healthy things.  \n\nI stopped by on my lunch because I wanted a smoothie to sip on throughout the afternoon at work.  When I walked in, I immediately liked the environment.  Everything was open and clean.  There was only one person in front of me, who was finishing paying.  She and the man behind the register were having a friendly conversation... that continued for quite some time and in to the time where she was waiting for her food.  I was only slightly annoyed since I was on a time constraint.\n\nI ended up ordering the Green Leaf Berry Blast with soy because it sounded both delicious and tasty.  Upon receiving it, I was surprised at its brownish color (which later understandably turned green due to the veggies in it).   My first sip was a shocker... I was not a fan.  I drink soy milk all the time in replacement of regular milk.  There was just a taste that reminded me of liquid Maalox.  I honestly think that my choice on the menu was just a poor one and I would have been better off with a juice.  Next time, I will definitely opt for one of those.  I feel bad that I wasted over $8, but I've definitely learned my lesson!"

The tofu fries are very tasty and amazingly seasoned, however the menu states they are BAKED when they are actually FRIED, they automatically lose two stars for the false advertisement (which I've complained to management several times and STILL haven't changed on their menu).\n\nThere are about 5 or 6 different fresh juices on their menu and they do taste good, but they could use a little more variety.  Nearly all of their juices contain grapes and agave nectar.  Their Wellness Drink, which contains spinach and kale, also adds too much pineapple, orange and agave, making this fresh juice overly sweet.\n\nThey are located across the LVAC so there are a lot of people coming from the gym seeking a healthy meal.  But don't be fooled!! A lot of their menu IS healthy however things like sauces, cheeses, dough, batter etc. almost defeat the purpose here.  If you're truly seeking wholesome order the plainest rawest things on their menu.\n\nI go to greens & proteins for the convenience and taste, but think there are better similar establishments.

Then they ended up making too much, filled my cup and dumped the extra --- all of those wonderful fruits and vegetables --- down the sink. So frustrating to pay nearly ten bucks for some diluted smoothie, the rest of which is wasted, flowing down the drain."

I'll be back, let's break it down\n\nAtmosphere: Clean, well lighted,,, I felt healthy walking in. Smells fresh.  Basic seating set up.  I went at 11:30 Saturday and it was not too crowded,, people there but not too much.\n\nFood: That's what you're here for right? The best description again is,,, clean.  Seems to me that it's all natural organic type food.  I've had burgers, Avocado/Crab cups, and some of the drinks.  Burgers are surprisingly juicy, and I'm looking to try some of the salads next time.\n\nDrink: Note the smoothies are like a meal so you probably don't want that AND a full meal unless you are splitting.   The juices are all very nice and clean.  Favourite is the Wellness drink.\n\nPrice: For what it is,,  a little expensive,, a juice and any meal will be twenty.  One of the other Yelpers claimed it was the Whole Foods of restaurants and I think its a great comparison.\n\nMiscellaneous: One of the few places I can think of that put calorie counts."

I heard about this place from a friend and I have been addicted ever since. \n\nWhat I order:\n- Turckey Burger plain wrapped in a Lettuce shell. It is amazing, low cal and low carb.\n- Tofu fries. They taste like cheese sticks! SOO good. I dont care for the Jicama fries, skip those unless you are on an ultra healthy kick. \n- Cup for water. This is a MUST. They have free cucmber infused water, it tastes wonderful. \n- Juice. The ginger limeade is my favorite! It is under 200 calories and packed with healthy fruits and veggies! i neer imagined I would crave a green juice, but it tastes sooo good! It is the perfect consistancy to drink and stays cold long enough to enjoy it. \n\nBest part: This place is packed with healthy people all the time! So if you are like me and need some insiping to get your soft butt to the gym, check this place out to eat! There are lots of HOT guys (and girls) to check out. They also have wifi so I can yelp. \n\nMake sure you check in to get a dollar off a juice/smoothie :)\n\nOnly downfall, it is slightly pricy. If you are on a Jr. Bacon Cheese diet, this isnt your place. But remember, spinach, tofu and fruits arent cheap to buy."

            "review": "I have to agree with some of the other posters about the bland food.  Decided to check this place out for the first time with a friend and unfortunately, can't see myself returning.  I ordered a rough cut roma tomato salad and the tortilla soup.  My friend ordered what looked like a mix of steamed veggies and rice (steamed broccoli, kale, mixed squash/zucchini).   The salad they brought out for me was mainly radicchio and frisee (the red/purple lettuce and the light green \"fuzzy\" lettuce just in case you're not sure what that is); two of the most bitter greens that I'm least fond of.  The dressing was a bitter vinaigrette with lemon, I believe.  The tomato slices appeared to have been sitting out for a while; not fresh at all.  There were some spinach leaves thrown in along with some cucumber.  I took a bite and was hit with bland bitterness.  At first, I thought there just wasn't dressing but the guy explained that there was dressing on it.  The tortilla soup came out and did not look like soup - it appeared very thick, almost like orange hummus.  I dipped in and it tasted very sweet, like pumpkin, without any type of \"mexican/tortilla\" flavor.  I couldn't force myself to eat it although I was starving.  I told my friend she should try the soup to see if it was just me.  She seemed very hesitant by the look of it.  She took a dip and stated, \"There is no flavor....it's just...sweet?\"  I didn't quite understand what I had ordered.  Her meal came out; just steamed veggies and brown rice.  I tried some and it was fine but I can't fathom paying the $13 for this when it is one of the easiest things to make at home....steamed veggies and rice.  I lost out on $12 myself.  I couldn't eat my food and soon pushed it to the side so I could just focus on hang time and not the hunger pangs in my stomach.  When I left, I came home and made an amazing organic salad, topped with LOTS of avocado.  They should hire me to improve their salad menu. :)"

The dressing tasted fantastic, but there wasn't much of salad in a half order.  The cashier made me think it would have been bigger.  I ended up taking a slice of my bf's buffalo chicken pizza. OMG it was really good - and i'm not saying that just because i'm carb depleted.  The toppings were very good and had a nice sweet tangy zip.  My kids enjoyed cheese pizza and pasta, but i was confused that the kids size pizza was the same size as my boyfriends full size pizza.  I don't get that.  In the end, i really enjoyed dining here.  It would be great to see one of these restaurants open in the N. Phoenix, AZ area where I live!"

They offer bison, ostrich, your traditional chicken, and tofu. This is my second time at g&p but my first at this location. Its super hip and it's also a great place for your lunch break or catch up on work. \n\nI ordered their bison cheese steak on a spinach wrap which is about 600+ calories for $10.99. It also comes with their yummy tofu fries and dipping sauce! The cheese steak is delish and the bison is super lean. Bison is just naturally full in flavor so if you're looking for a good manly meat that's lean but tastes like cow (mmoooo) go bison! I also ordered their white chocolate veggiechino which is 500+ calories for $6.99. I chose the almond milk (you can choose the option of soy or Almond milk) it was pretty delish with grains of grinded up coffee bean. If you're looking for a big caffeine kick I would not bet that the veggiechino will be a good pick me up especially if you're a coffee drinker. But as a sweet milky treat. I think it's a good choice. \n\nMy meal summed up to $20 for myself. It is a bit pricey but if it's just one of those clean eating going out to lunch days I say go for it but I would only drop in occasionally if I'm in the mood. I just think their price does equal the value in portion for me."

Now I'm used to cooking and making my own healthy greens and protein foods, so I have a bit higher standard for places like this. First of all, they are relatively expensive but this is understandable considering the healthy ingredients which tend to be natural or organic. \n\nMy friend ordered one of the actual meals while I ordered one of the green drinks, I believe it was the one with chocolate flavor. Anyways, my drink tasted horrible. Maybe it was too healthy but I couldn't swallow it. If you are into this type of thing, maybe its for you. My friend ordered something I believe with the eggs and it was ok.\n\nThe environment is very nice. When we went the place was booming so I have no complaints there. The staff is friendly and it gives off a healthy, clean, fitness vibe. I think you just have to be into this type of food. It's a different taste which I don't like but many health buffs will like.

The green leaf berry smoothie was good, but the apple pie smoothie tasted watered down.  Next the Margherita Pizza (about 10\" across / enough for 2 people to eat) was just like any other you can get and the Thai Chicken Peanut Satays sounded appealing.  They were supposed to be spicy, but were not at all; they were chicken skewers with some kind of creamy peanut sauce over them.  \n\nNice atmosphere - guilt free eating - just wish it was more affordable."

The execution can be a bit spotty and the food, while decent, won't make you forget about all the unhealthy (and more delicious) alternatives around town. The BBQ pizza was ok, but the crust was too soft and doughey. The bison cheesesteak wrap was good but I couldn't help but fantasize about biting into a real Philly cheesesteak while eating it. The girl behind the counter raved about the tofu fries but I wasn't a fan. I've never been much of a tofu fan and the fries failed to convert me.\n\nMy favorite part of their menu is the \"Build your own custom meal\" where you pick a protein, grain, green, and sauce of your choosing. It's perfect for when you want a quick meal, don't feel like cooking, and aren't in the mood for traditional fast food. The pork tenderloin with the balsamic reduction was good, but the portabello mushroom was overcooked. Portion sizes are on the small side so don't expect to walk away full. \n\nThere may be some drawbacks to this place, but it's still a good option for a quick meal."

I really wish I had more time to try more of the menu, but, very limited amount of time in Vegas.\n\nThat said, the breakfast that was served to the table next to me looked amazing and I can't wait to try it.\n\nThis go around though, hammered down on the \"build my own\" with ostrich (check another animal off my \"got ya bitch\" list of animals consumed!), sketti squash and some mashed sweet taters. Also got an antioxidant blast smoothie (berry mix).\n\nSo, the chow.\nOstrich - very lean, and decent. Tried it without the citrus bbq sauce first, and it was ok. Was hoping for a bit of seasoning or something, but, it was just cooked meat and no seasoning help. With the citrus bbq, not bad at all and solid chunk of meat. Texture was and cooked temp were not bad either. All in all, a solid slab of lean meat.\n\nSketti squash - tasteless and didn't seem to be cooked enough. Was very disappointed in this one. I'm usually a huge fan of this and make it my own quite a bit (gives me something to do when my madre delivers 12 giant squashes from her garden). But, a little citrus bbq made it tolerable to wolf down like a desert coyote.\n\nMashed sweet taters - very good. Was really happy to see this on the menu as a carb option. I hadn't had them in a while, and was pleasantly surprised to have a solid plate of mashed sweets. Perfectly fluffy, not stringy (which sweet taters can be when mashed thanks to the fibers), and solid flavor. Only thing missing was a chance to throw some cinnamon on them. If you've  never done that before, give it a go. Fantastic. I promise.\n\nAntioxidant smoothie - Great flavor, miss on the texture. I knew it'd be a bit think and chunky thanks to the apples (without an amazing juicer, apples are a prick to deal with). But, was hoping this place would have a juicer that'd take that away. Not so. \n\nIn any event, smoothie and food rang up over $24. Considering the ingredients and if I were to order something similar elsewhere, I'm sure it'd be close to that too. So, not overly fussy with the price."

So excited! \nTHOSE WITH CELIAC'S/GLUTEN INTOLERANCE BE CAREFUL: see below\n\nI was very excited to discover this chain had opened up on the southwest part of town. They are ingeniously located near LVAC, making it easy to get a healthy recovery meal after your workout. We ordered: Pumpkin spice chai latte, veggie garden burger, and bison burger. Total after tip= $38.10 (we took our food to go). A little on the high end $$$. Our food came out pretty quickly, but our smoothie took longer than expected. I was hoping to get that first and sip on that as an appetizer while we waited for our food. I don't know if they forgot about our smoothie or was just slow on making it. I did notice however, people after me get their drink before me, they also knew him on a first name basis and gave him the extra out of the blender in a separate cup. They should treat everyone as if they are a regular. Talk about not making me feel special. \n\n~Pumpkin Chai Tea Latte; Chai Tea, Pumpkin, Green Cabbage, Carrots, Butternut Squash, Flax Seeds, Ginger, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts, Agave Nectar. This was really good and very filling. Although the cabbage was pronounced, the smoothie was well balanced and tasted raw (the way I like it).\n\n~Bison burger w/ jicama fries; choice of swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce tomato and onion on a whole grain bun. He wished he got it with cheddar rather than swiss. \"Jicama fries\" are just sliced jicama lightly seasoned with what looks/tastes paprika. \n\n*Veggie garden burger; I was extremely excited because I'm a sucker for alfalfa sprouts. I asked the cashier if the veggie patty was gluten free, as I have had a difficult time finding a veggie patty that does not use \"wheat gluten\" as a binder. He asked someone on the cooking line, who I assume was a manager, and he said \"yes, it's gf, the patty is soy based protein\" I took their word for it and gambled the risk. Sure enough I think the veggie patty is glutenous so BEWARE to those with celiac's/gluten intolerance. I got sick, as I do from eating or cross-contaminating with gluten/wheat. I have yet to bring my concern to the attention of the staff. Moving forward, the burger was eh-okay. My gluten free bun was hard (it's difficult to get a soft, buoyant bun using gluten free flour, especially if you're taking your item to go. In the future I will dine in. I ordered my burger with tofu fries. I was told that they dust the tofu blocks with rice flour and fry it in corn oil, so the oil should not be a point of cross contamination, as there isn't anything else with regular flour going into the oil. My burger came with the sprouts, bibb lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I also added vegan cheese, it's shredded.\n\nWe also added avocado to our sandwiches ($0.75/burger) for a quarter of an avocado (rip off). I don't mind paying extra for modifications, but make it worth my while and not be so skimpy! At least give me a half an avocado for that price, so that I can have it in every bite as opposed to just half my burger. I was charged extra for vegan cheese, again this would be fine, but there was less than a teaspoon sprinkled on my burger, with a $1.00 up-charge.\n\nAlthough the food is pricey, it's raw, healthy, and typically quick, right up my alley. I will be back because there is not many others around like this and to inform them of my gf veggie patty concerns. There are just a few \"tweeks\" they need to adjust before they get the 5th star from me.I hope they properly label their menu on their website and physical menu so gluten free & vegan items are clearly marked. Just remember they do not operate out of a certified gluten free kitchen, but it seems that for the most part they handle issues like cross contamination okay.\n\nService was exceptional. There was a constant line (with one cashier) at 3:00pm. He was very nice and patient with me since I had a lot of questions."

Most bites had more overlapping layers of tortilla than filling or veggies. On top of that, the menu lists the wrap as coming with \"a side of tofu homefries\"- this sounded really cool to me and I was excited to check it out.\nImagine my surprise when I open my take out box in my car and realize that a \"side\" consists of exactly THREE crouton-sized pieces of tofu. They were tasty, but considering I spent $8 on my meal and my take out box was half empty, I'm not pleased. I genuinely don't know if someone was in a hurry and forgot my side, or if three pieces really constitutes a portion- it doesn't to me.\n\nI might come back, but it won't be for food- which is really disappointing, because everything sounds great.\n\nSide note: If you check in on Yelp, you get a dollar off of a juice or smoothie, which helps a bit with the pricing."

A side of tofu home fries originally comes with this, but you can replace that with another side listed on their menu. Also, you can choose to sub the tortilla with lettuce. With that being said, the burrito only looks good on paper.

It is extremely helpful to have an idea of how many calories I am consuming per meal. However, I have let them know they should add the calorie count for the tofu fries - for consistency, of course. No joke, but I have been losing some weight after working out, along with eating a couple of meals here per week.\n\nIt is safe to say, I am a bit obsessed. Enjoy!\n\n*New location in North Las Vegas. Please see my review."

However, I'm not a health nut, so this review is from the perspective of a guy that has never stepped inside of a Whole Foods.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright and inviting. It just looks healthy. Almost like a Jamba Juice, but in restaurant form. The menus are clear and displayed nicely above the registers on a few flat screens.\n\nI ordered the bison cheese steak on a wheat wrap. It comes with a side of tofu fries or jicama fries. I went with the tofu. The wrap wasn't bad. It tasted like a ground beef wrap. The tofu fries were surprisingly good. However, I'm a tofu fan, so take that with a grain of salt. My coworker on the other hand hates the tofu fries.  I wish there was an option to order something unhealthy here. Just because I want a healthy entree doesn't necessarily mean I want a healthy side too. I should be able to get artery clogging potato french fries with my healthy ostrich burger. I shouldn't be limited to an all or nothing healthy meal.\n\nMy coworkers love this place, so inevitably I'll be here again. I would never come here on my own though. I don't like paying a premium for anything, even if it is organic and healthy. On the bright side, the female eye candy was solid."

I'm really big in to health and fitness, and this place definitely meets the needs of health freaks, while also giving some more indulgent options as well. No matter what I always order the Wellness Drink every time I go. SO AMAZING and packed with fresh delicious ingredients. If you're a green juice person, this is the drink for you! I also usually always order their barbecue chicken pizza. The crust is amazing, the thin crust and the gluten free, I've had both, and the sauce and flavor is just incredible and the pizza only has 320 cals! How awesome. I have also had one of their wraps, forget the name but it's packed with a ton of vegetables and comes with tofu fries. So delicious, except I would say that the asparagus in the wrap was just a little too crunchy for me and kind of threw off the texture of the rest of it. I also have been to the Henderson location many times, and I must say this location just does it was better! The shape of their pizza is better and the taste of their smoothie was amazing.. but overall.. LOVEEE greens and proteins! definitely go if you have the chance! you won't regret it!!"

I do have yet to try any of the food, so when I do get around to doing that, I will update my review.  \n\nI want to give it more stars, because I have really enjoyed both of the drinks I've purchased at this place.   \n\nFirst time, I had the \"Green Leaf Berry Blast\".   A nice mix of berries and leafy greens.  It came out a sort of purplish-brown color but it really tasted great and filled me up.\n\nThe second time, I had the 'Wellness Drink', which is a mixture of green grapes, apples, limes, some other fruits and then a bunch of leafy greens.    The taste was fresh and fantastic, and it really hit the spot after my workout.    So yummy and it has all that good stuff in it.  \n\nCustomer service was fine both visits.   My drinks were ready in a snap.   The atmosphere of the place is inviting and comfortable and it works with their health-conscious atmosphere.   I could see myself eating here.\n\nSo why 3 stars?   I'm deducting one star because at 8 bucks a pop, well it seems a bit pricey for a cup of juice.  But that doesn't keep me away. \n\nThe other star I am deducting for 2 reasons.   Lack of nutritional info and the use of agave nectar in every drink offering.   I track everything I take in, and I would think a place that serves up healthy food could offer more than a simple calorie count.  How much sugar is in these drinks?    Macros are important to my lifestyle.   I would like to see a more comprehensive breakdown.\n\nAnd the agave is extra sweetener that is just unnecessary and really not a healthy choice IMO.\n\nI am eager to try some of the food offerings.    I will update or offer up a better review at that time."

I was supposed to meet Suzy H. and her son here, but due to a miscommunication, she went to the Eastern location instead.  No problem.  Intending to share my food, it just meant that I ate two breakfast items all by myself, the Granola Crusted Whole Wheat French toast and the Greek Scramble.  Sure, I could have taken leftovers to go, but I just kept eating until there was nothing left but the parsley.  I guess I was hungry from my earlier swim, but it was also because the food was really good.  I'd been to the Eastern location about two years ago and had a so-so experience for dinner, so much so that I've never been back there.  This brunch, though, has changed my mind about G&P.  I would certainly come back anytime for a morning meal.  I had excellent service throughout, and, contrary to my own belief, the cost for breakfast wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be, $13.94 for both dishes.  Of course, having my Groupon handy made it even cheaper, but still.  I look forward to returning by myself, or with Suzy H., or with anyone else who wants to have a healthier breakfast at a decent price.   \n\nP.S.:  Suzy H. and I ended up eating breakfast together after all, via cellphone.  That's what friends are for :)"

So I come here with my dad and he orders a parfait and I order a green 'juice' and the total comes to about $16 dollars with tip. I thought that was a tad on the expensive side but I know the prices of juice are very expensive because of the amount of vegetables and fruits that go into a juice (I worked at a juice bar for about two years so I understand juice pricing). So my 'juice' comes out and it's a smoothie? I do not know how they can call these smoothies juices?! It was frozen and it was really sweet for something that was considered a green juice. I was very disappointed and felt very mislead. My dad did not like his parfait either (too sugary). As a health nut and a biochemist I would not consider this place to be healthy at all. Albeit I have not tried any other items but i will assure you that I will not be coming back to try anything else. The only time that any one should go sugar load there is after a very High intensity work out. The only reason I have this place two stars is because the service was lovely. \n\nA note for the greens and proteins owners: \nI would recommend rewording the menu so it is not so misleading.
