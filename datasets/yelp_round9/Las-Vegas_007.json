            "review": "This is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas! We had the smoked beef tartare, bone-in rib eye, beef wellington, mac & cheese and potato puree. Everything was absolutely delicious, the portions were generous and the plating was pretty. I really wanted to try the sticky toffee pudding for dessert but was way too full (and they don't do take out). It was pricey but well worth it. Will definitely return on my next trip to Vegas. \n\nTips: If you're really hungry DO NOT get the beef wellington because it takes 45 minutes to prepare. AND get reservations a few weeks in advance."

            "review": "If this review was solely based on the mac & cheese then it would easily receive my five stars. Unfortunately, that is not the case and it is difficult to get five stars out of me (unless bribed--just kidding, kind of.) I firmly believe that the dining experience cannot solely be based on the food alone.  It is about the energy, the ambience, style, timeliness, service, the quality of the ingredients used, and the food itself. Overall, Gordon Ramsay lived up to each of these which is why if asked if I would eat here again, my answer would be a resounding YES!"

We got seated upstairs right away. Our waiter came and he was a little cocky and didn't give us a very welcoming vibe. Good that the good justify this place. We ordered smoked beef tartar, British onion soup, a salad, his signature beef Wellington and two sides to share (corn and mushroom). They brought us some rolls and they were all so delicious and the beef tartar was so refreshing. What a great way to start our meal! Then there came out soup and salad. The soup was sweeter than a normal French onion soup, but with a wine after taste; nothing special about the salad but it was fresh. They at first told us the Wellington would take 45 mins to cook, but it came pretty much right after we finished our appetizer, soup and salad. The presentation was on point and the taste was remarkable. So juicy, flavorful,  and tender. And the sides were also unexpectedly yummy. I thought the corns would be typical cream corns, but he really had his own twist on it. Fresh corns with jalape\u00f1o, lime and butter. Lighter than regular cream corns but full of favor. The mushrooms are assorted Asian mushrooms; tasted really good, but the sauce on a heavy side.\n\nWe were so full that we had no room left for desserts. So glad we decided to come to try this place in Vegas."

My wife and I planned our Vegas trip 6 months in advance and the number one thing I wanted to do was eat at one of Gordons restaurants,  especially GR Steak! A week before our trip went to make a reservation and all his restaurants stated they were booked solid for 8weeks! But what else would you expect, it's a GR restaurant, so I was disappointed.  We get Vegas and we're walking threw the Paris hotel and just to make sure we asked if they had any open reservations and to our surprise they had quite a few and made a reservation and we're beyond d excited!  We get to the restaurant which is amazing in and of its self.  We take our seats and I'm not sure if it's how they do things but it seemed like it took a long time to get our drinks and food, which we overlooked because we wanted to enjoy every minute. We order our food our first course arrives the British Ale Onion Soup, and it was amazing!  The best onion soup I've ever had, rich in flavor! I was sad after I ate it all because I didn't want the soup to end. For main courses my wife ordered the Roasted Chicken and I ordered the Beef Wellington, the roasted  chicken was beyond tender and juicy, the wild rice and crispy chicken skin complements the chicken very well. The beef Wellington was the best thing I've ever eaten! Definitely recommend it! You won't be disappointed. \n\nNow the reason I couldn't do 5 stars was because the service was decent, when your spending well over $100 a person you expect a certain level of service.  We ordered a side of Brussel spouts which didn't come out with the main course, we let our server know  and for about twenty minutes he would keep coming to the table and telling us there coming out but they never did. So we just cancelled them. And lastly at the end our meal after we had told our server we wouldn't be ordering dessert it literally took our server about 30mins to bring our check!  But the server assistant was phenomenal! Always kept our glasses full, checked in on us often but not to much, he was extremely professional, well mannered just an all around great guy! \n\nSo in conclusion even though service was not what we expected the food more than made up for it!  Maybe just a bad day for our server, we all have them. But next time we are in Las Vegas we will definitely be going back to GR Steak!!"

Kobe beef, mac and cheese, and sticky toffee pudding are must eats-one of most delicious desserts of my life. Table was messy entire meal which I did not like for this caliber of restaurant. Server and other wait staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations. We enjoyed the tablet based drink list as well. We would definitely come back for a special occasion if we lived in Las Vegas."

            "review": "The server was a real clown. Wish I remembered his name. He had dark slicked back hair and spoke with a spanish accent. He used to work at RAO's at Cesar's Palace before here. Someone in our party ordered the cocktail shrimp and thought it was tough, only took one bite. The waiter suggested the lobster appetizer, which was the most expensive thing on the menu. He took away the shrimp and brought brought out the lobster. One would think in a high end place like this, they would have comped the appetizer since it was not to her liking. Guess what, they put it on the bill and a manager never came out like most places would to to check up on us since we sent food back. Poor service rating b/c of this. I've eaten at a damn outback steakhouse in the past and even they will comp the appitizer if it was sent back. On;y good thing to say was the ribeye was good and the bread was better than the fried oyster appetizer. \n\nThe portions for the price are horrible. The fried oysters came with 3 for about $20???? Are you kidding me? for that price they should send out at least 6. You can't even share this appetizer it's so small in potion. The mac and cheese was good, but for the price they charge, it could only serve 1 1/2? When a place charges $10 or more for a friggin side, you can AT LEAST feed 2 people. I will NEVER eat here again. If in vegas, go to Del Friscos or Mastro's Ocean Club (it's a great steak place too as well as seafood) Ramsey can piss off with this place."

The wait staff and hostesses give impeccable service. I was particularly impressed with mohamabu (sp?). He kept this pancetta bread loving girl well stocked all night and seemed to actually really enjoy and take pride in his work.

It had all the ingredients listed and answered all the questions.\n\nThey come by with a cart of all the meats to show you what you're ordering.  My friend and I bought the bone-in and ribeye and beef wellington and then split it.  They put each half of wellington over potato puree on its own plate, but the ribeye came on its own plate, and we had to divide it ourselves.  I imagine that was a presentation thing.\n\nEverything was dreamily delicious.  The sticky toffee pudding at the end was pretty good."

We said the other water. Little did we realize that they charged $9 a bottle for it. And when the busser brought us another bottle, the server picked it up and put down another before we even drank the second one. So when they charged us $9 x 3 bottles I was a little miffed. But didn't realize that till after we left or I would of said something. \n\nWe ordered 3 of the beef wellingtons and one salmon. We asked if the sides were big enough to share, the server said they are just enough for one. So we each ordered a side. I ordered asparagus and so did my friend. Then when the sides came they forgot my asparagus and we had so many sides we didn't even finish them. And then they tried to charge us for the second asparagus so I told them they never brought it. \n\nThe food was excellent though but when your not use to eating at such an expensive restaurant I would appreciate that they let you know that they charge for the water and the sides could be shared. \n\nAll in all it was a fun experience and it was fun to eat at one of Gordon Ramey's restaurant."

I'll keep this short....the service was great when they were being attentive but suffers in time management. ..we were seated quickly but waited 40 minutes for bread....then an additional hour and 30 minutes for entr\u00e9es....I thought we were in the dining room for the first service of Hells Kitchen but no Gordon keeping the brigade in line. Or just being punked on camera...  food was not as good as my first 2 visits.   \n\nMy steak was seared but was more raw than medium rare, the sides were lukewarm then turned cold within minutes.  I didn't say anything as we were already there for almost 2 hours.  It was my brothers, his wife and friends first time,  I was hoping for a home run instead it was a strike out.   The money wasn't the issue going in but felt robbed leaving.  For the 6 of us we averaged $100 per person  and even though we waited so long for our food we still left 150.00 tip.  I can say now that this was my last time here."

Food was fantastic,(Beef Wellington, Kobe sliders, bread pudding, baked potato)\n and I would give it four stars if the seating didn't cause me to sit next to (common bench) a East Coast salesman trying to get two reps from an Australian auto parts retailer to carry his wares. His constant cartoonish Shecky Greene style banter was annoying and loud as hell. Because of the seating it was as if we were at the same table. \nAlso, the service is mediocre at best. I felt as if I was part of a production line, table cleared but not cleaned  no matter how many crumbs. I ended up spending $18 on water.\nNext time I am in Vegas, I will definitely check out other steak houses."

While it is customary to be asked if you would like distilled or sparkling water, I have never been charged $9.00 per bottle for distilled water.   There was also no way in hell that the six of us drank a total of 4 bottles of water in addition to the other alcohol and soft drinks that we ordered. Also, we never saw our server open a single bottle of this water bit every time we turned around, they re topping off the water glasses even though only a sip or two had been drank. \n\nI had no objection to spending $110.00 for the porterhouse for two or even the $6.00 for my wife's diet coke.....but I felt completely ripped off by this obvious bill padding for water!\n\nOn a positive note, the service and atmosphere were exceptional and I would recommend people visit but be warned of the \"hidden\" charges"

Our waiter brought over the menus and also he brought the cart full of different cuts of meats.  I appreciated that because I always like to see how big the cut of meat is before I order.  \n\nNow this was our first official meal of the day-yup, first meal. We were hanging out by the pool all morning and afternoon and had skipped breakfast and lunch.  So I was absolutely starving by then and ordered the 24 oz bone in rib eye.  My eyes are always bigger than my stomach :(.  We also ordered several sides to accompany the entrees: asparagus, ginger glazed shitake mushrooms, and the parmesan and truffle fingerling potatoes.  For starters, we received a platter of bread and butter.\n\nThe rib eye was delicious and cooked perfectly (medium rare).  I couldn't finish it in the end sadly, but my friend was able to finish it for me.  I also was able to try bites of my friend's beef wellington, and I thought that it was good, but I prefer the steak over the beef wellington.  I would come back here again next time I'm in Vegas."

Given the inconsistencies in both food and service, I feel like listening to his criticisms of others are going to be harder to accept.\n\n We started in the bar with two drinks; the English Sidecar and the Drifter. we literally could not taste a difference betweent he two and would have been convinced they were the same drink were it not for different glasses (one was served up, one on the rocks). I'm still not certain that the bartender didn't take a shortcut (or he wasn't very good).\n\n The service: it started off with the hostesses insisting we wouldn't be sat before our reservation time (30 minutes later) and telling us to wait at the bar; we ordered our drinks and before I had even finished signing the receipt, the hostess came to take us to our table. I feel like this is a common practice to get you to order drinks in Vegas, but when you don't order them from your servers, you can see their irritation. I don't mind waiting at the bar if I show up early, but don't quote a time that is utter nonsense (there were plenty of empty tables and seats at the bar) in order to get me to spend more.\n\nOur server (who looked like Santana from Glee but never gave us her name and it wasn't on the receipt) was very charming in the beginning, but her attention dropped off dramatically after taking our order. Our meal wasn't well paced and our tables weren't kept very clean. By the end of the meal, we spent a lot of time waiting for  someone to come and offer us the bill and/or desert and in that time we decided we would just call it a night.\n\n The food;\n\nAppetizer: We ordered the fried oysters, which at nearly half the price of an entree was very stingy on portion. It tasted good enough, but three oysters for that price? \n\nEntr\u00e9es: We ordered the Kobe filet, which was amazing! It was the superstar of our meal. We ordered it medium and it came out closer to rare, but it was such a good cut of meat that it was actually better off that way. Tender and juicy; perfectly seasoned.\n\nWe also ordered the Beef Wellington, which was presented as a signature dish, but left a lot to be desired. It wasn't bad, mind you, but it didn't hold a candle to the taste profile of any of our other dishes and felt more like it was \"special\" in it's profitability for the restaurant than in the care put into it. We ordered it medium rare and it came out medium. Perhaps it was a mixup on the ticket (or possibly by the server), but this dish can't really afford to lose any juice to temp. The single best part about it was the side dishes; the potatoes were fantastic and the other veg were very tasty too.\n\n We ordered a side of the truffled mac and cheese and it was delicious! If I could pull a do over again, I would have rather have had more of that instead of the Wellington.\n\n This is a high-end meal that doesn't deliver as well as some of the other options around. It's sold on the promise of the Ramsay name so maybe our expectations were too high, but you watch his numerous television shows and I feel like high expectations are to be expected. At the end of the day, we would give someplace else a try before spending money here again and in Las Vegas, you have plenty of options."

Since, we always come here with our 2 kids , and our best friend, we already knew to expect to bring about 700 bucks more or less. Since, we are not big on alcohol we opted for just water all around, and a couple of ice teas. Me and my husband had the american rib cap it's delicious , my kids both shared a 32oz porterhouse which was just average. My kids definitely loves the sticky toffee pudding .I would say pass on the sliders for the appetizer because its not worth the price for 2 pieces. So I think with our second trip to this place I would say it was a hit and miss. If your a total reward member you get a little discount on food."

I had the Beef Wellington, which I must say, was one of the best things I have ever tasted. The sticky toffee pudding with the brown butter ice cream was a culinary delight. I wish I could buy that ice cream by the gallon!!   We saved this place for our last night in Vegas and boy did we go out with a bang. The whole dining experience was 5 star from begining to end."

First of all they charge for water ($9) and do not tell you, so hopefully you aren't thirsty when you go there. The service was good, the bread was great, cocktails (try the hk antioxidant) are excellent. Started with the maine lobster tail appetizer which was hardly the size of a shrimp ($27) and a cesar salad ($15) panera has better cesar dressing. We had the beef wellington for 2 (good but not excellent for the $101 price tag and it was tricky to eat) we also had asparagus on the side which was not cooked properly (stringy). The food was good but WAY overrated and we left disappointed."

I was just in Vegas over the last couple of days and whilst there went to GR Steak in Paris Hotel/Casino. I did my \"homework\" before my arrival and I knew just what I was going to order...I absolutely could NOT wait!! We arrived 15 min earlier then our reservation which was no problem and we were seated right away. The restaurant was nice, a little smaller then I imagined but nonetheless nice. We were seated upstairs and were greeted right away by our server. She explained the menu's and took our drink order. We ordered 2 diet cokes and looked over the menu. I decided on the special scallop appetizer and beef wellington (of course!), and my beautiful date ordered the filet mignon. We ordered the mac and cheese and truffle fries for our sides. We also ordered a glass of wine/champagne to toast 11 yrs together! \n\nWell, here we go...the bread plate was wonderful! Each piece had a distinct flavor and was just delicious. My scallop appetizer came out next and was awful. It was very, very salty and was very under cooked. It could have been a crudo thats how under it was! BTW it was at this time we began to realize how chilly it was in the restaurant as we must have been seated under a vent! (ladies bring a wrap or sweater). Next came the main course. The \"welly\" was beautifully presented and looked wonderful! Too bad the taste DID NOT live up to its beauty! The dough was soggy on the bottom, the mushroom duxelle was the consistency of paste with no texture at all and the flavor was bland. The mac and cheese was outstanding and the truffle fries were just fine...no complaints there! My girl enjoyed her filet and said it was very tender. Because we were so disappointed with our meal, we skipped dessert and asked for the check. \n\nTotal check, $243! They charged us $6 ea for the diet cokes...SIX BUCKS!!!!! That really rubbed me the wrong way!!\n\nBottom line is this...I was very disappointed with this meal and have had way better at Ruth's Chris, so save your money and go there instead! SIX BUCKS PEOPLE...SIX!!!!! :-("

The hostess showed us around the restaurant, kind of like a mini-tour, which made it feel really exclusive and classy. The interior is amazing and they gave us a seat in the upstairs back room where most big parties were seated (or so it seemed).\n\nFirst of all, the service was excellent. The servers seemed genuinely happy to serve us and were very helpful. I thought they would be more condescending because, well, it IS Gordon Ramsay's restaurant... But no, they were down to earth, happy to answer questions and made suggestions as well. They also recommended how to have the meat cooked but never pressured any of us at our table to get it done that way.\n\nI was also thoroughly impressed by the \"meat trolley\" that came out. It was amazing. They had their cuts laid out for display, and the waitress explained each and every cut, how it prepared and how it would be cooked.\n\nLastly, the food. I order the bone-in rib eye (24oz) with a side of tempura and garlic aioli. The rest of my party had the beef wellington and the kobe american rib cap. When I first cut into the rib eye, i thought it had been overcooked. I asked for medium. But it became red when I cut further into the meat. It was very succulent. I also had a bite of the beef wellington which was also amazing.\n\nThe best thing on the menu was the toffee  dessert. The moment we all took a bite out of it, our lives had changed. Do NOT leave that place without trying the dessert."

So for my birthday hubby took me here and I have to say I enjoyed my birthday dinner to the fullest .. I was in amazement of the 2 floor restaurant  which the entrance served as a tunnel into London lead  into the bar and lounge area and then to the restaurant .  Had such awesome d\u00e9cor and walking all around the restaurant everyone greeted you with a hello or welcome it was very nice . I had a blast with the drink menu which was on a tablet  .I also loved the meat cart with all the different types of steaks it was very well presented I must say . we were given a bread platter which was yummy but be careful one of the breads had walnuts which I'm allergic to but it was no big deal they gladly exchanged it for  a platter with out walnuts . We ordered the Kobe sliders which were so tasty and delicious and a little pricey but it was worth it .  \n\nNow for dinner my husband is obsessed with beef wellington and let me tell you that it was very tender and full of flavor and he said it was worth the 52 dollars . He said it was a well spent 52 dollars and highly recommend it to anyone . I ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye and let me tell you that rib eye was so damn tasty ,tender so full of flavor it was delicious and also worth 56 dollars I got to say you are paying for what your eating so to me it was totally worth it . our sides were  truffle mac n cheese and the fingerling parmesan truffle potatoes which both sides were tasty, delicious and cooked perfectly not dried out and the only thing I didn't like was the mac and cheese had green peas but hell I hate that's how good they were and for people who know me I Hate peas   .His cocktails also had lots of flavor and can you taste the liquor it was a sweet cocktail but with a kick and for 14 dollars it was also worth every sip . . By time dessert came we ordered the chocolate layer cake which was very good but I was a big of the passion fruit filling but other wise it was good . I was very happy hubby celebrated my birthday here it was worth it all the way .  Plus of your a total rewards member you get a few dollars off as well which isn't it too bad . I loved Gordon Ramsey steak house and cant wait to come back again that's for sure \n\nkeep up the good service and excellent food I enjoyed it so much if you can splurge then try it because I don't think you will be disappointed at all"

Tonight my boyfriend and I went to this restaurant with high expectations to our celebrity chef Gorden Ramsay, but our dinner turned out to be the worst night ever. Although it started off really well, throughout the meal, the server seemed to be tooo busy to come to our table and check what was going on.\n\nPros:\n- We had Gobe Beef Cap, which was really good. But it would have been better if there were less pepper.\n- The app that we ordered was quite ok. (Gnocchi)\n\nCons:\n- They did not serve the bread knife for my boyfriend.\n- The order how they put the forks were wrong. I mean, REALLY? At 3 stars of michelin the server or a food runner I'm not sure, but they miss how to properly put the forks?\n- The bread came after 20 minutes since our orders were taken, and right after the bread came out, the appetizer came out, which did not consider our time to enjoy the bread.\n- The server recommended us the wine and we ordered, but after about 15 minutes, he came back and said the wine is all sold-out. I mean, if you were to recommend something, shouldn't you check in prior to recommend one? We were seriously disappointed at this point.\n- The most disappointing thing from our dinner tonight was that the server never checked on us until I catched him from going away from us to check our main dish since an hour has passed since our orders were taken. I should say this 1 star is all from their poor service.\n- Afterall, I felt like I was mistreated from our server. I even felted like the server was discriminating us by race because he served really well to our next table where white people were dining in. They came after we ordered but left earlier than we did. Our food came out way too slowly.\n- The server did not even show up to give us the bills and nobody said bye to us as we left the restaurant.\n\n\nIt was our last night at Vegas but this just ruined all of our moods. Thanks a lot Gorden Ramsay Steak for tonight and I will never go to any of Ramsay's restaurants ever. You've just lost the 2 big fans of yours."

Went with the French Onion Soup and it was delicious.\nWe were a party of 8 and sat upstairs in a nice room. Half of our group was very late for our reservation but they let us sit down on time and wait for them. We ordered a few drinks while we waited. The service was great up until we actually received our meals. Our server came over a minute after our food was served to check on us and then disappeared along with everyone else that works there apparently. We finished our meals and sat and waited (drinks empty) a good 10 minutes before we had a busser come up to us to clear some plates. We had to ask him to get our server so we could get a check. We waited a few more minutes and finally he came and asked if we wanted desert. Then we had to wait a few more minutes for our check. I didn't think it was overly busy but even if it was that is no excuse for waiting that long.\nBesides the service, the food was great. Everyone loved their meals and they raved about the steaks. My soup was really good. As with every fancy restaurant on the strip, especially the ones with celebrity chef names attached, the prices were a bit ridiculous.\nNice menu, good atmosphere and shaky service."

What a horrible experience this time!  I was embarrassed that I talked this place up.  Let's start with being seated upstairs in a room off to the side with no atmosphere.  It took our waiter, Gary, about 10 minutes to come say hello.  Gary offered us bottled water, still or sparkling.  Gary failed to mention that the bottled water was very expensive!  Gary then gave us an iPad with the drink menu.  Gary came back 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  I don't drink, so I ordered a ginger ale.  Gary said, \"just ginger ale? No alcohol with that?\"  I thought that was a bit rude, but it got worse!  We still did not get our dinner menu's after being there for 30 minutes already.  \n\nGary brought out the cart with all of the cuts of beef available, and sped through the presentation.  To be honest, the size of the cuts we were served didn't quite measure up to the size of the cuts on the cart.  Gary aggressively pushed the higher end Wagyu and Kobe cuts.  He also said as a \"special\" you can get any cut Oscar Style, with asparagus, jumbo king crab meat, and bernaise sauce.  $53 for this \"special.\"  There were 2 cuts of Filet Mignon.  One was the 28 day dry aged, and the other was the Wagyu.  About a $20 difference in price.  One of my friends ordered the filet Oscar style.  Gary didn't ask if she wanted the dry aged or Wagyu- he just put her down for the Wagyu- very presumptuous!!  Same with another friend who ordered the same thing.  When all 6 of us finished ordering, Gary exclaimed, \" it looks like you don't have enough side items ordered.  Why don't I put in an order of Mac n Cheese and potatoes for the table.\"  Ummmm No!  We didn't want them, why assume we should have them?  \n\nIt took over an hour to get our entrees!  Unacceptable.  Gary never once came over to let us know what was going on.  If he wasn't trying to aggressively upsell us, he paid no attention to our table!  Dinner came, and the food was good- not great.  My ribeye had a tough texture and consistency.  Definitely not like the one I had the first time there.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after we finished our entree's, Gary came around with desert menus.  Considering we were there for over 2 1/2 hours already, and we were full, we all decided not to order dessert.  At that point, Gary again tried to say we must have dessert, that we would regret not having dessert, and said \"at least two sticky toffee puddings would be good for the table\".  Again, NO!  So we declined, at which point Gary got pissy, got our bill, slammed it on the table, and walked away!  I couldn't believe it!  We paid our insanely high bill and Gary didn't say thank you!  Now, mind you, I tip 20% all the time, 25% if the wait staff goes above and beyond.  I struggled to give Gary 15% because of his aggressive upselling, his assumption that the people wanted the Wagyu filet, and his petulant attitude at the end of dinner.  \n\nI will not be going back to Gordon Ramsey Steak.  The attitude, the excessive wait time for entrees, and the upselling really turned me off."

We waited for 1.5 for our food to come out on slow day. There was another couple who came in after us, got their menu before us, ate before us and paid/left when we just got our food. They had another server. So 50/50 chance with service in a Ramsay's fine dinning house lol. Food was average. Steak came out warm with side dishes, not hot. Steak was bland. Felt like it was left under the heat bulbs for awhile till I ask another server about our food. It came out 5 minutes later. The environment was good. Nice decors. Conclusion,  service was not good, food was average, presentation is good. Price is never the factor for me if the food and service is good. I expect better from Chef Ramsay. When you put your named on on the restaurant, own it. Very honest opinion, I had both Ramsay's burger and the steakhouse. Average for both. I would say shame on Gordon for raising the bars and not owning up to it. Bloody nice guy, great personal coach and chef, not great restaurants."

My fish was amazing, but the chips nothing special with just a simple ketchup to dip them in and they were kind of hard and not warm. The fisherman's grill was okay, nothing was really out of this world, I have had better scallops and salmon on a much cheaper price but it was still tasty and we enjoyed it. The mac and cheese side was amazing. The carrots pretty good. The $20 ravoili appetizer not worth it but the $45 bottle of moscasto and sticky toffee pudding was amazing.

This is, by far, one of the best dining experiences I've had. And the man who made it an even better experience was our server, Dennis.  We started off with drinks and had a question regarding Pimms Cup.  We were not familiar with the alcohol, so we asked Dennis who proceeded to give us a brief history of the origin of the liquor.  We were blown away!  The drink by the way, was delicious. Sweet, bubbly, and very refreshing. Next came the bread.  Yes folks, I am about to swoon over the bread.  The prosciutto and fig bread left a smokey flavor in my mouth that I almost did not want to eat anything else in order to savor the flavor.  I said almost.  But then I put a little bit of butter with the black, volcanic, himalayan sea salt over the stilton bread which left me with my own salty volcanic explosion on my tongue.  Amazing!\n\nIt was time to order and Dennis was very patient with us.  He was honest and helpful about what to order and gave great descriptions about the food.  For an appetizer we decided to go with the kobe sliders and the chorizo stuffed lobster.  Both which were very satisfying.  The beef was juicy and seasoned well.  The lobster had a bisque over the top that, if I could, I would pour myself a bath of it and eat my way out.  Then came our main course.  As a Hells Kitchen fan, I had to try the beef wellington.  That was a no brainer.  Between the table, we also had the roasted chicken and filet.  For the sides we had the carrots and the mac and cheese.  Did the beef wellington live up to the hype?  Why yes friends, it did.  Dennis recommended medium rare which I was a little leery about because I usually prefer medium.  But he had not steered me wrong yet so I had to do it.  And he was right.  The wellington came out beautifully with a perfect crusty, flaky puff pastry and melt in your mouth beef.  My mouth was overwhelmed with flavor.  I also sampled my friends dishes and the chicken was moist, the carrots left a hint of heat in my mouth, and the mac and cheese.... Oh, that mac and cheese.  The perfect blend of cheeses.  Salty, creamy, with a little bit of a crunch over the top.  One of the best I've ever had.  \n\nCompletely stuffed from my meal, I still had to save room for desert.  I've heard so much about the sticky toffy pudding that I knew I had to try it.  Dennis agreed.  He told us about this award winning sticky toffy pudding and we knew we couldn't leave without it.  We also ordered the carrot cake to sample the menu a little more.  The carrot cake was delicious and I do not want to undersell it because that alone would have been a great end to the meal.  But the sticky toffy pudding brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it.  The presentation was creative with the brown butter ice cream in the form of a stick of butter and a small butter knife in it.  Then there was the mouth watering sauce over the top of the warm, fluffy pudding.  I took a bite with each component and I literally sighed and melted into my seat.  Best. Dish. Ever.  I would make the 5 hour drive every week to Vegas to get just one bite of this sticky toffy pudding.  If you go to Gordon Ramsay Steak and can only get one thing, GET THE STICKY TOFFY PUDDING! \n\nI've been to many fine dining restaurants before and this one is definitely at the top of the list.  Thank you Dennis, for making it a fun and inviting experience.  The next time I am in Vegas, I will visit Gordon Ramsay Steak again.  Here's hoping Mr. Ramsay will venture out to Phoenix and leave behind one of his awe inspiring restaurants."

I was BEYOND surprised. \n\nFirst off, the food is excellent! The quality of the beef is terrific and the preparation is excellent. They have MANY cuts to choose from which makes the experience even more fun.\n\nSecond, the service is wonderful. \n\nThird, while it's loud and busy, it's still a great ambiance and great for families. \n\nI'll definitely be back when I'm next in Vegas. Believe the hype - this place is GOOD!"

I ordered the beef short ribs and they literally were cooked to perfection--so tender and the wine flavor was outstanding. My boyfriend ordered the rib eye and he swears it was the best steak he has ever had.  We also ordered the truffle mac n' cheese and wow, was it truffle-y, very tasty! Service was just okay..waiter was not very friendly and seemed very snobby for some reason. Oh well! The food made up for the lack of service in my opinion. The bill at the end of the night was pretty much what I expected it to be--not cheap, but well worth it for a special occasion.  The only thing that would have made the experience better would have been if Gordon was there cooking our meal..*sigh*. lol"

This was quite an extraordinary experience and the amazing food was well worth the price. And Chef Christina Wilson (winner of Season 10 Hell's Kitchen) was expediting our food in plain sight!\nWhen you order your entr\u00e9e, they serve you an appetizer of assorted breads that were absolutely tasty. In addition, we ordered the American Kobe beef sliders which contained sharp English cedar and caramelized onion on a brioche bun. It was very delicious.\nMy husband ordered the Beef Wellington which is beef wrapped in puff pastry and baked. It came with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, and wine demi glace. We never tried this and always wondered what it was tasted like and it exceeded our expectations. This was without a doubt, one of the most delicious beef dishes that I have every tried in my entire life!\nI also ordered one of the best poultry dishes I have ever had at any restaurant. It was the roasted chicken breast which include confit leg, foie gras wild rice, tikka masala, and crispy chicken skin. This chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and bursting with flavors! The wild rice was rich and saucy! This was quite an enjoyable dish and I recommend it to poultry lovers!  \nWe ordered the Mac and Cheese side which had cheddar, parmesan, and was bursting with an explosion of truffle flavor! We enjoyed it very much. Our dessert experience was more than amazing! I had the Chocolate Layers which was chocolate cake that has passion fruit ganache layers and was served with dark chocolate gianduja ice cream. Absolutely heavenly!  My husband ordered the Sticky Toffee pudding. It is a sweet pudding that came with a brown sugar toffee sauce and was served with brown butter ice cream. Very delectable!\nOverall we had an amazing experience at this establishment and I would recommend it to both locals and visitors. Worth the price and the taste will be epically memorable! 5 stars!"

We all concluded that it was absolutely nothing special at all and 4 out of 6 people in our party did not care for their steak at all. The flavoring in the steaks were completely absent and there was just nothing special at all about the food. I will say the tartare and the Sea Bass my friend had was very good but that was really the only thing anyone in our party liked. The service was also nothing special which you would expect out of a steakhouse labelled as $$$$ on Yelp. Lastly, the restaurant is extremely loud. I'm not exaggerating when I say that you have to shout when communicating with people at your table. I won't be coming back and I will not recommend this place to anyone. Again, just nothing special at all and it was actually pretty pricey at $250 per couple."

The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, particularly our waiter, whose name is escapes me but I believe it was Gary or Eric. We both ordered the Hell's Kitchen Prix Fixe selection with the wine pairings. Our waiter was incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about each course and explained them in detail. \n\nThe food exceeded my high expectations. Everything was plated beautifully and with a lot of attention to detail:\nScotch quail egg with lemon zest\nHeirloom tomato and watermelon, herb infused salad with an amazing vinaigrette\nSeared scallop over a pea and wasabi risotto \nMedium rare Beef Wellington (filet) with root vegetables over a potato pur\u00e9e\n\nFor dessert, we had sticky pudding that was served with a warm toffee syrup and vanilla bean ice cream that looked like a stick of butter. Literally, this was the best dessert I've ever tasted. It's not something I would typically order, and I was absolutely blown away. This is a world renowned dish that has been awarded best dessert in Las Vegas several times. Now I know why. \n\nI am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and we both received autographed pictures. Chef Michael even came to meet us after the meal. What a bright and talented guy! \n\nI wouldn't expect any less then perfection from one of Gordon Ramsay's establishments. However, the creative and beautiful food, the friendly and passionate staff, the incredibly talented chef, and the modern decor, has made this is my new favorite restaurant!!!!  After a horrible exchange with the general manager at the Top of the World restaurant in the Stratosphere, the experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak absolutely saved our anniversary trip!"

You have set the bar very high.\n\nI want to say thank you to Ted and John for taking the time to serve us. The attention to detail throughout the night was amazing, and impressed us several times during the dinning experience. Ted is the man you want helping you decide from the impressive menu. He made us feel very at ease with our choices and made great recommendations. \n\nFor the appetizers we had the Kurobuta Pork Belly and it was absolutely delicious. The crunchy skin and tender center mixed with the cheesy grits created a great balance of texture and taste. A must have! \n\nFor the main course we had the famous Beef Wellington. My boyfriend and I have been watching Hells Kitchen for a long time and wanted to try one of his signature dishes. Let me tell you, it was more than we could have imagined! The Wellington was cooked perfectly.   The center was nice and pink, and \nthe potato pure, red wine Demi glaze, and vegetables compliment the dish perfectly. \n\nWe had a side of Mac and Cheese, and if you are a blue cheese lover, you will not be disappointed. Is a very unique dish full of flavor. \n\nFor dessert Ted recommended the signature Sticky Toffee Pudding. \nHowever, he went the extra mile to taylor the experience to our tastes and found out what flavors we preferred and recommended the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar. We where in heaven after taking the first bite!  If you are a peanut butter fan you must try this. The crunch from peanut butter ganache mixed with the peanut butter cremeux and chocolate mousse mixed well to make a perfect dessert to end the night. \n\nOverall it was an amazing dining experience from start to finish!  Next time you visit Vegas, you must make time to have a great dinner at Gordon Ramsey Steak. You will leave with a great smile and a happy belly!"

The Oysters were nothing special; not bad, just nothing special. The Beef Tartare was also just OK. The Mac n Cheese and Potato Puree were both really good side dishes.\n\nFor entrees we ordered the Bone In Ribeye and the Beef Wellington. I'm not sure what a Beef Wellington is supposed to taste like, but what we were served, I was not a fan of. The Ribeye, however, was tasty and cooked very well.\n\nAnother negative was the location of our table. We were sat directly behind the kitchen line where their staff was constantly joking, laughing, and overall being really loud. It was tough to keep a conversation when you had six or seven guys screaming throughout our meal.\n\nWhat saved the meal for me was the Sticky Toffee dessert. I'm not a dessert guy, but I would absolutely go back just for this and a beer to wash it down. It's a complex combination of flavors and textures that I've never really tasted before. Major WOW factor.\n\nTo me, Gordon Ramsay Steak is a good, but not great restaurant. There were a lot of positives, but too many negatives for me to rate this any higher."

When the plates arrived, we had two steaks and a chicken breast.  Servers immediately corrected this error and we all moved on without any problems.... Then the bill arrived, since our waitress went on break after delivering the check, I had time to review what we ordered against what was on the check.  Everything was charged, along with this mystery baked chicken.  When I brought it to the attention of our waitress, she apologized and corrected the error.  I hate to think like this, but I wonder how often this routine is attempted over a night,.. People know the bill is going to be about 150 per person, have a few drinks, toss in their credit card and move along.

I was SUPER hyped to finally try the beef wellington after watching seasons upon seasons of Hell's Kitchen and seeing how difficult it was for those chefs to make one cute little beef wellington. Let me tell you, it definitely did not disappoint. I can't even describe the sensation I had as I put a cut of the meaty goodness into my mouth. It was as if all of my steak endeavors had finally reached an epiphany - that all other steaks I'd tried before had been subpar because I had been waiting for this moment of eating Ramsay's signature beef wellington. A true masterpiece. All I could do was moan about how delicious it was because I was speechless. I would recommend those who come here to definitely give it a try.\n\nThe other, less important, dishes we ordered were half a dozen oysters, the wagyu sliders, and my boyfriend got the American rib cap as his entree. \n\nThe oysters were alright. I'm a huge fan of oysters so I wanted to get them for myself but they're nothing spectacular or amazing. Definitely skippable unless, of course, you're dying to get your aphrodisiac on before hitting the club. I'm always trying to get my aphrodisiac on.\n\nThe American wagyu sliders come in 2 little burgers, perfect to split on a dinner date. They are delicious! Seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would recommend trying them! So cute and adorable.\n\nMy boyfriend really enjoyed his rib cap though I don't think it even compared to the beef wellington tbh if I say so myself, but again, I'm probably biased.\n\nThe complementary bread is also really good! We didn't get to try the walnut (?) one because my boyfriend is allergic to nuts, so we skipped that one, and the lemon one wasn't that great, but the two that are shaped like little muffins were amaze. I could eat those breads for days.\n\nOne thing that had me a little sad was that they don't do anything special for birthdays besides very briefly say, \"Happy birthday!\". Bummer.\n\nVery expensive meal, dropped almost 3 bills, but very worth it. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas and try the mac n cheese."

I made the reservations for 6:30 pm.\n\nSomehow we got there at 6:30 and were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to a booth on the main floor.  Their booths seat 4 and are set up as in the shape of connected \"S\"'s.  Our booth faced the kitchen which I found to be very interesting. Our server was named Anthony and he was very friendly and knowledgeable.  After we were served our drinks he came by with a display of all the steaks they serve and he explained each of the steaks and the difference between them.\n\nI wanted to order the \"Limited Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu\".  He informed us that the Chef required that all people at the table had to have the same menu, because of the length of time it took to serve it and he didn't want people who didn't have the menu to have and sit and watch the others eat for an hour.  It made sense.  If I am ever in Las Vegas by myself I will go back and have it.\n\nFor the appetizer I ordered a Half Dozen Oysters and a bowl of British Ale Onion Soup, my wife had just the British Ale Onion Soup.  All were delicious.\n\nFor the main course I had the Roasted Beef Wellington with a Fully Loaded Baked Potato and a sand Pan Seared Foie Gras with a side of saute mushrooms.  My wife had the American Wagyu / Kobe Skirt Steak, with a Fully Loaded Baked Potato and Ginger Glazed Shiitakes.  My wife likes her stake well done, Anthony said that that would make it too tough and that they recommend it medium rare, but he would have thee push it towards the medium well. \n\nMy wife said her steak was a little tough, as he said it would be, but the flavor was good. My steak was delicious and was so tender that you may not have needed teeth to eat it.  Since this was the first time that I had Foie Gras, I didn't like it.  When I told Anthony about it, he said if he had known that I was a newbie, he would have suggested that I get the appetizer version that comes with sauces.\n\nOverall, I feel the food and service were worth the price.  The reason I gave it only three stars was be cause of the noise.  If we had 4 people at the the table, I doubt that we could carry on a conversation without yelling.  A restaurant of this quality and price should be more intimate and you should be able to carry on a conversation without yelling.\n\nThe only reason I would go bact there is if I was alone and that would be to have the \"Limited Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu\"."

He demands perfection both in the kitchen and front of house and that is evident at his restaurants even though he is not there personally.\n\nFor the second summer in a row, Jeannene and I not only found ourselves in Vegas but also at Steak and both times (plus once at Ramsay's N.Y. restaurant) we found the food to be the freshest, cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly and the entire waitstaff to be perfectly attentive.\n\nWe started off with the seared foie gras ($26) and found the gooseberry jus to be subtle instead of the usual sharp acidic fruit compote or sauce that accompanies foie. and some crushed macadamia nuts gave it the needed crunch.The other couple we were with had the gnocchi ($21) which was equally delicious and it was a good thing they shared the appetizer because it could have been almost enough to be an entree.\n\nHaving done the tasting menu the last time, we went right for the beef wellington ($57) this time. I especially appreciated the sea salt sprinkled on the end of the sliced beef. There was only a little potato puree and a couple of root vegetables so do think about ordering a side. One of the other people we were with ordered the roasted chicken ($33) and declared it the most perfectly cooked chicken she'd ever had. I tried the rice pilaf that came with it and was blown away by how much flavor was packed in it.\n\nAnd for dessert we once again got the sticky toffee pudding ($14), partly just because we enjoy seeing the brown butter ice cream that comes in the shape of a stick of butter.\n\nThe ambiance is that of a high-end Vegas steak house so there is some noise, but it's not off-putting."

Topped with a generous portion of seared foie gras I really can't recall ever having a better steak.  The bread service was great, and the cocktails were all perfect.  Good beer selection as well.  I couldn't care less about this being a \"Gordon Ramsay\" restaurant but if you're in Vegas and would like a great steak you could do a lot worse.  Just note that this place has a loud clubby atmosphere, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner this isn't your place."

At $145 a person (we had 2 people), I was expecting bigger portions. \n\n The first item was a qual egg which was eaten in 1 bite. Followed by a beet salad which again was finished in 2 bites. Then the risotto which Iw as excited for because im a HK fan. It was so tiny, we finished it in about 3 bites. It was just a little more than a spoon full and it wasn't good at all. it was normal risotto.\n\nNext came the wellington which was good followed by their signature dessert which was awesome. So the lesson learned... I spend $300 on the tasting menu when I could have just ordered the wellington and dessert and it would only cost me $140.\n\nThe bread they give is very good. There were 3 types.  And we got 2 servings because its free.\n\nSo long story short, avoid the tasting menu, the risotto sucked and just get things ala carte."

There was no room in the bar, no one offered to allow us to take a drink and sit in the casino.  We were finally sat at a booth for 4 with 2 chairs added, we were located at the top of the stairs.   So, everyone that walked by had to shuffle around us, we were in front of the door that led to a big private dining area, so every waiter that walked in had to walk around us...got the picture.   My scallops would have never passed the test on Hell's Kitchen, so I suggest that you go here as a last resort."

            "review": "If I could give 10 stars, I'd give 20. \n\nThe dinners of all dinners and certainly number one on my top five dinners of all time.  \n\nDECOR: The restaurant has a very modern vibe, with a very comfortable atmosphere.  The London Underground entrance/bar is a very nice touch as well.  Perfect for a romantic dinner or a dinner with friends and family.  My boyfriend and I dined with my parents on our trip out there. \n\nEXPERIENCE: Make sure when you're coming here, you are here for the experience of it! That means, don't rush!!! Take your time, especially if you are getting the Beef Wellington, which was superb.  The waitstaff was super attentive and very charming, making jokes with us throughout the night and adding the overall wonderful experience. \n\nDRINKS: I had three...count them...three Pimm's Cups which is one of the signature drinks here (a huge drink in England).  They were to die for! I don't drink that often, but these would make me change my mind.  Its delicious, crisp, and super fresh, filled with fresh fruits and garnishes. Really great drink.  My mom got a dirty martini with stuffed olives, which she loves, and said it was really great.\n\nFOOD: Finally, the main event. Don't come here and plan to stick to your diet btw, this meal is for you to fully enjoy and savor.  The food right down to the bread they bring you before the meal was UH-MAZING.  I mean, Chef Ramsay gives you a choice of pancetta brioche on the plate.  That's right...BACON BREAD.  And its heavenly as you can imagine.  We got one appetizer: the oysters.  The oysters were perfectly fried and the presentation was fantastic on the half shell.  \n\nNext, the entrees....I had the American Filet which is the Kobe style, and it was fork tender and seared perfectly to a medium rare.  The kicker was I added a half pound of Alaskan Snow Crab legs.  Holy Hell.  Talk about to die for.  They were poached in butter and cooked perfectly.  I have had my fair share of snow crab legs, but these were ridiculously good.  My boyfriend had the famous Beef Wellington, and it was worth the wait.  The signature dish Chef Ramsay totes, is succulent and cooked perfectly, and when you get a bite with all of the plate fixings its heavenly.  My mother got a regular filet and it also was fantastic and tender.  My Dad got a ribeye and again, the steak quality is phenomenal.  We also shared a bunch of sides: Mac and cheese, Mushrooms, and Fingerling potatoes.  The mac and cheese (coming from an addict) was good enough for me to fly from the East Coast to Vegas for one serving of it.  Yeah, order it.  The others were great too, nothing too special about the potatoes or mushrooms, but everything had a great taste profile.  \n\nDessert was a whole other animal.  Sticky Toffee pudding with Brown Butter ice cream, the house specialty.  My mother is not a dessert person, but she still raves about this dessert.  The toffee cake is super moist and warm, especially when they pour the vat of toffee sauce over it.  Then you take a bite of the brown butter ice cream and sigh, because you can't even explain how good it is.  My boyfriend and I split this dessert because we had all had a lot of food so far, and he still to this day complains to me that he can't believe he had to share it with me and he wished he'd had his own.  What a baby, lol! But it really was that intoxicating.  \n\nThen a lovely surprise...my mother and I ordered coffee and besides your own french press, you get 6 chocolate/alcohol stirring spoons, two of each kind...for free! The selection was milk chocolate filled with Baileys, white chocolate filled with Amaretto, and dark chocolate filled with Chambord.  I thought that was a great touch, because they could have easily charged you good money for it.  \n\nAll in all, the bill was outrageous, but we expected it and to be honest....it was freaking worth it.  It was the first thing we all raved about to people back home.  We had gone to Alize earlier in the trip and were completely unsatisfied with everything, especially the price.  I have no problem dropping money on a meal as fantastic as this one, believe me, and would happily do it again. How I hope to do it again, lol!\n\nSo don't let the price keep you away, I promise you will be completely elated with the entire package at Gordon Ramsay's Steak."

I was very sad to not see Gordon in the back screaming and cursing at people. I think this is reserved for the tv shows. He must have been off filming one of the millions of shows he is on.  Any who lets get back to the restaurant review.  I had reservations at 5:30pm.  We were seated promptly by the hostess.  Yes the hostesses were dressed a little scantily but who isn't dressed scantily in Vegas.  Our waiter came and greeted us.  Unfortunately I forgot his name.  I am sure all the waiters or waitresses are great.  We did not order a cocktail and settled with the water.  The water came in a glass bottle.  I was a little nervous since I was not interested in paying for water.  My anxiousness was subdued when I saw that everyone that wanted water were all served with this glass bottle.  No extra charge for the water.  I order the short rib tortellini with the sweet brains.  For you that do not know from not watching Chopped and various cooking shows sweet brains are organs.  The appetizer was so delicious.  I wanted to order 2.  Next was the entr\u00e9e.  I ordered the filet, not the kobe just the regular one.  I wasn't in the mood to pay double for a filet.  As sides I order the mac n cheese and roasted corn.  The sides were great but not spectacular,  My grannie makes better mac n cheese.  Please understand I am used to southern mac n cheese.  For a high end restaurant it was good.  The filet was what stole my breath away.  It melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection.  After these items I am full however still wanted a dessert.  I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  OMG, OMG OMG.  I ate the whole thing.  This dessert was delicious.  \n\nOverall summery, there will be no screaming and profanity.  This is saved for the tv show.  The food is great.  I would definitely come here again if in Vegas.  You don't have to pay for the bottle water and definitely save room for the dessert.  Make sure you come here before you start hitting the tables or slots.  It will cost you a pretty penny.\n\nOverall rating 9 out of 10."

The Asparagus soup had little bits of caviar in it to add a perfect salty flavor.  I considered licking the bowl, but I wanted to keep cool around the surrounding rich folk.  Oh, and I don't even like Caviar.  I then went all out and got the Beef Wellington.  It was unreal and cooked to perfection.  I honestly can't rave enough about the food.  My boy basically got the same meals and we split a bottle of wine and also both ordered the spotted dick (heh) for dessert and finished off with a cappuccino.  Surprisingly, the tab didn't break our wallets and was rather reasonable.  We also scored a 20% discount since my boy works for Caesars Corporate.\n\nThe coolest part of my dining experience at Steak was that Gordon himself showed up and actually made the rounds.  He greeted every single table at the same time (right after dessert and before the check was placed).  I couldn't help but creep and gawk at his every move.  When I saw him making his way over to my table, I got a little celebrity shy, because the man is very tall and, well, good-looking!  He ended up chatting with my boy for a few minutes over the redonk Mac n' Cheese and was the same sarcastic prick that we all see on television... but still very genuine.  Our handshake was a little awkward in that he continued to hold my hand while chatting.  We're talking about a three minute handshake here, folks.  It's like the man can't help himself around blondes.  I took it as a compliment and I've made sure to brag about said handshake probably about eighty different times..... 'cause I can!  He was taking pictures, but I didn't want to be THAT girl.\n\nThe only downside is the decor.  It's not as cozy as I anticipated and the British flags were all over the place.  I get he's British and proud.. and as an American, we take the cake for being annoyingly proud, but it just seemed so clich\u00e9 to have British flags EVERYWHERE.  A little overkill.  \n\nOverall, killer experience and the food and service is worth the price.  Thank you Gordon and co. - my burps tasted delicious for the remainder of the evening."

The water server was much more pleasant and happy than our table server.  I did not understand the ambiance of the place:  elegant food, modern decor, but the music was nonsensical noise; way too loud and I don't even know what kind of music it was.  Just didn't make sense to me at all.  I was served a glass of wine from a bad bottle and feel the server should have known it, or the bartender, as it was a Pinot Grigio and the color was orange!  My chair was also broken and it is a good thing I noticed it BEFORE I sat on it.  Other than that, it was great fun to eat and experience Chef Ramsay's food, finally!!!!  My husband had the steak, and it was cooked correctly, but the flavor was just average.  It needed a little pizzazz. Though, the lobster mac and cheese is unlike anything you've had before.  Just super creamy and cheesey!   I had the fish and chips, and it was delicious - the batter was very light and crispy.  The wine selection is limited, but you should find what you like on it.  The appetizer shrimp cocktail is amazing and fun to look at!  I've seen the steak presentation at other restaurants, so I knew what to expect, but I don't think our server was particularly helpful in that area......he seemed too distracted and rushed.  It is worth a try for a special occasion and if you have some cash to spend."

This review is really for the restaurant more than the bar so the weak drink isn't considered in the rating.\n\nThey found us at the bar once our reservation was up and were promptly seated at our table.  Service at Steak was superb.  Our server was knowledgeable about the dishes and tried to accommodate each of our requests.  We all ordered the tasting menu which presented us with a 5 course meal.  Two of us went with the wine paring as well and shared it with our significant others.  There was not one dish that went unfinished until dessert as we were all full by the end of the meal.  We then ordered a couple of glasses of port (Sandeman 20 year tawny) followed by 25 year old Macallan.  We requested that it be served with a single cube of ice but was told that they do a bowling ball.  At $75/glass the bowling ball is a classier touch but a cube would have sufficed as well.  \n\nAs stated service was fantastic.  We all left feeling satisfied and although not cheap well worth the expense when you're in Vegas.

There was nothing wrong with my steak but I guess I expected a WOW factor or something special but it was just a good steak.  Mac & Cheese by nature is a kind of bland dish. Gordon's was loaded and I mean loaded with garlic. Maybe that is the way it is made or just the dish I received. To me overloading a dish (usually mashed potatoes) with garlic always seems like an amateurish culinary mistake. Any way the mac & cheese was not to to my liking.

The staff was very helpful and very willing to provide me with another steak. I received another steak and while cutting it found it to be very tough  also. I decided to give up on getting a good prime rib with this restaurant.  If you're looking for a decent meal sans prime rib,  this restaurant is ok but if you plan on ordering the prime rib, you're taking your chances"

The music was very hip and the \"channel tunnel\" look was a nice touch however I was not sure about the serving station which was sandwiched in amongst the rows of tables. I do not come to a restaurant so see my server cleaning plates and assembling knives. \n\nAnyway I had the onion soup as an appetizer. It was excellent however he bread was served by someone who could barely speak English. I am certainly not a xenophobe however there were some almost dangerous consequences as I did not understand the explanation that there was mushroom in the bread (which would have caused some serious health issues had I not caught it). Furthermore its just frustrating not being able to understand what has been presented in front of you.\n\nAnyway my biggest issue tonight was the steak. I ordered a ribeye. This is a fatty steak. I know this, however almost half my steak was gristle. It was a joke. What was worse I showed my server the plate half full of fat and he argued with me and basically told me I should have ordered another steak. I did not pay $300 on a meal for two for some snooty waiter to lecture me on the finer points of a cow. I got a bad cut of meat and rather than apologize the waiter turned it around and made it my problem.\n\nWe ordered sticky toffee pudding and it was excellent. A must if you go to this place.\n\nOverall this place was ok but at $300 on a meal for two I expect it to perfect which it was not."

This was my first time having foie Gras and I loved it. It really enhanced the Already Amazing Piece Of meat. I was worried that The size of the rib cab was too small at only 8oz but with the sides (fingerling potatoes and shitakes) we were stuffed. Somehow we had to make room to try the famous toffee pudding dessert and it was amazing. Go here if you don't mind spending the $$$$."

It's difficult for me to take him seriously because every time I see him on TV, he's screaming at someone and making them cry.  Well I am definitely glad that I decided to try steak because it was a great experience. \n\nThis restaurant seemed like something out of a Blade movie.  It looked like a vampire club; all black and red and the hostesses were wearing all black with sheer.  You are given a brief walkthrough and eventually end up in the dining room, where a huge flag of Great Britain covers the entire ceiling.  There is also some weird light fixture that I believe represents his hand movements as he is making his signature Beef Wellington dish.  Interesting...\n\nThe service was really good.  They kept checking on us throughout our meal to make sure that we were okay.  Or waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu. The only problem that I had was the wait time between our appetizer and entree.  It was at least a 30 minute wait! I'm not expecting to get our steaks right away, but more than 30 minutes seemed like a long time to me. \n\nNow on to the food! We stated with the Pork Belly appetizer and it was amazing! It was so soft and delicious.  I've had lots of pork belly in my life, and this one ranks up there with the best. It was a great way to start the meal.  \n\nNext up was the main course, a Wagyu Rib Cap with Lobster. This was the first time that I had Wagyu and it won't be the last.  The steak was great,  so flavorful and tender.  I swear I could cut it with a fork.  It was very well seasoned. I did order a side of Foie Butter just to try it out, but the steak was great on its own so I didn't end up using much of it.  The lobster was also delicious.  We had the baked potato and creamed spinach as side dishes.  Both were also good. \n\nFor dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and it definitely lives up to expectation.  The cake was so moist and delicious and went really well with the ice cream.  The French Press Coffee was good as well.  Good coffee that was accompanied by three chocolate dipped spoons that were flavored with Amaretto, Raspberry and Bailey's...nice touch.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with Gordon Ramsay's steak.  Good food accompanied by good service makes this place one of my favorite Vegas restaurants."

The noise level from the music is annoying, luckily we were seated in the downstairs dining room and were able to converse without too much trouble, but the overly loud music does detract from the dining experience.  Our server Matthew and his assistant Sean were wonderful, we had great service and the guys were both very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Food was very good, I had filet mignon cooked perfectly.  We shared the house salad which was nothing special,but the bread/butter \"presentation\" was wonderful.  Shared the tempura green beans which were delicious and also the loaded baked potato with gruyere bechamel sauce, heavenly!  Hubs had small bone in ribeye which was tasty and cooked perfectly, unfortunately, it was chewy.  We also ordered two side sauces, the house steak sauce was very good, the Worcestershire Demi glac\u00e9 was overly salty.  I can't even say that we complained about the ribeye or the sauce, we merely mentioned it to Matthew.  As a high end restaurant should, the two items were removed from our bill.  Matthew also came back and told us that the Chef agreed that the sauce was too salty.  Good to know that he kept the Chef informed and that he took the time to follow up with us.  Matthew also brought us a complimentary Sticky Toffee pudding for dessert....to die for!  Especially the caramel ice cream.  We will definitely eat here again and will request Matthew as our server.  I give the restaurant only 4 stars mainly because of the noise level, not because of the mishap with the steak and sauce.  It just happens sometimes that a cut of meat isn't as tender as it should be.  The seasoning and temperature of both steaks was spot on."

We had the best service and food we've ever eaten at any restaurant.\n\nWe tried several appetizers including the gnocchi, stuffed lobster tail (which had lentils in bisque and it was phenomenal), pork belly, and beef tartar which comes out with garlic potato chips and was to die for!! \n\nFor dinner I had the beef Wellington and my husband had the american beef rib cap. The rib cap has marbling throughout so it was pretty rich, tasted fabulous!! The beef Wellington didn't disappoint, so much flavor!! Be prepared though, it does have a longer preparation time. For accompaniments we had the sauteed mushrooms (divine), Brussel sprouts, and Mac n cheese. My husband said the brussel sprouts were very tasty and the mushrooms were as well. The Mac n cheese was good, just a little heavy on the truffle.\n\nDessert had always been my favorite meal, so we had to sample a few. By far the sticky toffee pudding with caramel ice cream is the best dessert I've ever had!! It's worth the entire trip!! We also had the apple tart tatin which comes out nice and hot and the waiter places the wonderful cinnamon ice cream on top so it's served a la mode. The cinnamon ice cream is so smooth and delicious!! My husband is a peanut butter lover so he tried the peanut butter bar which he said was his favorite.\n\nOur service was phenomenal!! We had Matthew and Derrick as our servers. They were extremely attentive and were always there before we even realized we needed anything. Matthew was also very good in knowing the menu and made some recommendations for us. \n\nBy far this is one of the best restaurants in town!!"

It sure was a great experience and a splurge.\n\nUpon arrival, my hostess explained the tube at the entrance, the Union Jack and the fluorescent lighting fixture in the center of the ceiling (it was a depiction of Gordon's hands cooking). Quite interesting I must say.\n\nAnother interesting thing is the restaurant uses iPad to allow me to select/order drinks. Fancy :) \n\nI went with the Tasting Menu and thus I received a copy of Tasting Menu with Chef Ramsay's autograph as a souvenir. Nice!\n\nThe wheel of beef is quite amazing to look at and I already decided to order American Wagyu Rib Cap next time!\n\nThe complimentary breads are all warm and soft. It even come with butter that has been sprinkled with volcano salt!\n\nBeets were sweet and amazing! My Beef Wellington was awesomely juicy and full of flavor. Perfectly seared and seasoned.  \n\nToffee sticky pudding was a must try and interestingly the ice cream looked like a tube of butter. Although I was pretty full, I still managed to finish the ice cream and 2/3 of the yummy pudding.\n\nLastly, the Cappuccino was accompanied by three spoons with wine being covered inside chocolate. That way, I could just dip the spoon in my coffee and stir to release the wine. Great idea and too bad I could not try all three flavors (the coffee would be way too sweet!)\n\nThe music did not bother me at all (probably because of where I sat).\n\nThe service is indeed top notch. Thank you for having me and I can't wait to come back!"

The sommelier gave great suggestions since we didn't do the wine pairing that came with the menu. All his choices were spot on. The main reason we came was for the famous Beef Wellington which was moist and the pastry was crisp and delicious. The bread starter was phenomenal and we could have made a meal from just the bread.  The evening topped off with another famous Ramsay dish, the sticky toffee which was as delicious as I've always pictured it. We were able to meet sous chef Jason Scallion from the show and he autographed our menu (that was autographed by Gordon Ramsay. \n\nIf you come here, pay the money for the tasting menu.

Now i'm writing this review after eating at the old home stead steak house at caesars palace; there are many factors and variables that both restaurants lack but i will go through each one and determine which is best. First SERVICE, GR is flawless, you take a sip of your water its refilled, you need a spoon its brought out to you at lightning speed. The waiters are on point, they know the menu inside and out, they know their steaks and explain it well to anyone who knows or doesn't know about meat. Now to the good part FOOD! to start I got the Demi Roasted Bone Marrow and Caesar Salad, the bone marrow yet very delicious; I would do without the mint sauce and stick with a more traditional bone marrow and cracker but still good. Next the caesar salad ehh nothing fancy 3 romain leaves with a GR version of caesar dressing with a battered fried quail egg; the sauce very rich and overpowering but i think the fried egg made the dish. Now to the main course got the American Rib Cap and the American filet with a side of Haricot Vert and Potato Puree. The meat is un describable you have to taste it yourself, all i can say it was some of the best meat i have ever eaten; perfectly cooked flavored to perfection tender and soft like butter! All the sides complimented the dish the haricot vert were fresh and crispy and the potato puree OMG i'm getting hungry writing this review. The atmosphere of this place is nice, dark and ominous but the thing that i didn't like about it is i had made reservations for me and my gf and when we were seated it was in a corner near the kitchen entrance not a very romantic location especially if your gonna make a reservations and spend top dollar for a romantic dinner so minus points. Now down to price i was expecting to spend for 2 especially when i ate at old homestead the night before for 1 but i was shocked and surprised that for what we got and the service i was pleased to say that if you want to take your wife girl friend out for a nice dinner this is the place!! I will be back"

It was extremely noisy inside and we were unfortunately seated next to a girl with a potty mouth that ran through our meal.\n\nThe steaks were solid, tender and juicy but the flavors just didn't sit right enough. I enjoyed the truffled mushrooms more than my own 8oz. medium-rare rib cap. The seared foie gras was another standout dish but the bone marrow, although generously portioned for a $10 add on, was extremely salty and just a little undercooked. The wagyu filet was best in terms of flavor.\n\nToo bad the bartender was the only one who gave the best hospitality and took the time out to chat with us. Our own server was too busy cavorting with 3 cougars ready to pounce. \n\nFood took forever to come out. Even the server noticed because he offered to take our picture after we waited for 45 minutes and there was still no food on our table. We came here expecting to pay the price for fine dining but felt like we overpaid a little. Good thing is, Total Rewards members get a small discount on each dish so remember to flash that card!"

This place is amazing!! \n\nIt was a huge deal for me and my friends to come to Steak ready to splurge, especially since we're just a bunch of ordinary college students with a simple love of good food. But boy, was the price worth it. We were started off with a bread appetizer, which was superb! We especially enjoyed the two different types of brioche as well as the little sample of butter topped with a type of salt (I forget what type). We were even offered another round of bread and after a split second of \"We don't want to fill up before our meal\", we looked at each other with grins on our faces and agreed that we should never turn down free bread. \n\nMy friends ordered the Beef Wellington and I ordered the Ribeye for one along with the haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, and asparagus sides. The beef wellington was TO DIE FOR; it was extremely tender and flavorful, and the pastry on the outside was flaky and complimented the meat perfectly. Now I know why it is Ramsay's specialty (also note that it is cooked medium-rare). My ribeye was delicious as well as HUGE. It was cooked beautifully and didn't even need any sauces or extra seasoning. My favorite side had to be the haricot verts as I LOVE tempura and I don't know what they put in the batter...but it was better than any tempura batter I've ever had in my life. The three of us struggled immensely to finish our plates (and we didn't), but knew that we had to fit as much of the delicious food into our stomachs as humanly possible. \n\nWe then decided to end with the three of us sharing the sticky toffee pudding, which was out of this world. I just remember stifling a laugh when the waiter asked us how our dessert was and my friend's eyes just rolled to the back of her head. He definitely got a good chuckle out of that. \n\nThe service was better than I could've ever imagined. Every 2 minutes or so our waiter would walk by and make sure that our water glasses were filled and that all of our needs were met. One of the waiters even escorted my friend to the bathroom when she asked where it was! Whaaat? They were also probably the sweetest wait staff that I had ever had the pleasure of encountering and I honestly just wanted to give them all a hug as we left. \n\nAfter about 2 hours and $300 later, we all left more than satisfied, and ready to take on the town."

            "review": "Having already been to Gordon Ramsay at the London in West Hollywood, we were looking forward to our visit here in Las Vegas. When you arrive, you are greeted by about a half dozen twenty-somethings (if even that) in very tight black skirts and tops. Our reservation was confirmed so our wait was no more than 5 minutes. \n\nThere are some reviews here that read like a novel. Here's my take in just a few bullet points. \n\n* Service off to a choppy start but fully recovered. 3 Stars\n* Love the bread. 5 Stars\n* Smoked Steak Tartare was a hit. 5 stars\n* Onion Soup was memorable. 5 stars\n* Beef Wellington good, but I recall West Hollywood being better. 3 Stars.\n* Gnocchi was incredible. 5 Stars.\n* Sticky Toffee Pudding. Wow. 5 Stars.\n* Loud music kind of ruined the experience.\n\nOur server was very nice but his enthusiasm went south when I ordered the Beef Wellington for One and my wife order the Gnocchi (it's an appetizer actually) for her main course. When we had it in West Hollywood we couldn't finish it but at least we could take it home. Not here. We were staying in a hotel without a fridge. I have to say he did score points when the Wellington arrived on two plates along with the gnocchi in the middle.\n\nWith wine our check came to around $188 ++. \n\nAs we were wrapping up, the tourists started to drift in which I found weird. Here we're spending $100 per person for dinner and we have a mom pushing a stroller through the place looking up at the ceiling. That was followed by a family of 5 just walking around. \n\nI would recommend this place but unlikely we'll ever go back. It's just insanely expensive and it didn't quite reach any new heights as far as our dining experiences go. \n\nLastly, our thirst buds kicked in major around midnight. Most likely the steak tartare. Have plenty of fluids on hand for later."

The bone marrow tasted very special and is worth a try.\nThe mains - the filet, ribeye and New York strip were all very well cooked. Very juicy and tender, definitely of quality. The beef Wellington was alright, not fantastic and not worth to try. \n\nDidn't like the service at all. We were in a party of 6 and had to pay 100 bucks service charge. But waiter got our orders wrong, both drinks and meals which is not expected from a place like this where we are paying so much. We also found a piece of hair in the beef Wellington. Again, we don't expect this in a high class restaurant like this. There was no complimentary things despite telling the waiter about this."

I had the kobe steak and my wife had the Wellington and we were both speechless on how delicious everything was.  \n\nDefinitely get the toffee pudding for dessert, even if you feel too full!

She is what I would consider the pefection of GREAT customer service. \n\nThe drink menu can be found on a iPad, you can view all drinks, there ingrediants, and make your order on it.\n\nWe started with a platter of delicious breads- a walnut biscotti looking bread, a mushroom truffle oil baked puff bread, and a lemon loaf. From there our 3 drinks arrived- strawberry martini(super smooth), Primms Cup, and The HK Antioxidant.\nWe chose to start with The Kobe beef sliders ($17 for 2, added a third for an additional $8) YUMMMY!!\n\nThe three mains ordered- \nRoasted Beef Wellington $52\n -served with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, red wine demi glace (The infamous, PERFECT!)\nRoasted Chicken Breast $30\n -served with confit leg, apple butter, foie gras wild rice, tikki masala, crispy chicken skin (Super moist)\nFisherman's Grill $48\n -served with maine lobster, mussels, scallop, seasonal fish, vadouvan curry aioli (the seasonal fish was halibut, salmon, and i believe a portion of basa filet) \n\nOlga reminded us to save room for dessert as she had something special in mind! Thats a sure sign something amazing was coming our way, if we had the room to order it. Well let me tell you!! Holy god was it amazing!!\nSticky Toffee with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream \"Brown butter stick\"\nI would go just to eat this again and again and again!"

Im rating everything as a  \"10\" period. The toffee cake and butter ice cream was stunning.\n\nI am giving the front of the house and back of house both a 10.\nI can assure you as this is the Only Gordon Ramsay steakhouse, they DO know how to cook a steak and that's for freaking sure. \n\n\nThis is place isn't cheap, but isn't insane. Expect to pay around 100 each person plus tip. The food is worth it, and this comes from a guy who has no problems making complaints.   Make your reservations well ahead of time."

            "review": "It's true, anticipation is the best tasting sauce. Built around the hype and having viewed the prices I expected nothing but the best. I was more than let down. \n\nWith 3 of us at the table we all decided to share everything. We ordered enough for 4, maybe 5 as we had $500 to blow. (Once in a lifetime) We dined with an expert so she ordered for us all. \n\nWe ordered the salads for starters and they were nice but nothing to write home about.\n\nFor the main, I enjoyed my Wellington but it was a very soggy pastry not at all crisp. The mushrooms as a side made up for it. They were simply lovely. \n\nWe ordered all the desserts, and 2 extra toffee puddings to take home. The pudding was the best by far and made to share as its a very rich dessert. More ice cream would be nice or a tarter ice cream to balance. \n\nOverall, having spent $500 for 3 people, we enjoyed a very tasty and filling meal but you would hope that to be the case! The left overs are just as yummy out of the microwave (sorry Gordon) lol\n\nSo that was the food. If we had collected our own plates from he chef it would be a much better experience.\n\nFrom start to finish the host to our server was a nightmare. Snotty and pushy to start with and absent from taking care of our meal for the rest. Our mains all arrived with 5min between them. The salads were wrong. And he disappeared. He appeared to have changed his tune later and came back when it was time for the check. I wanted to say \"where have you been?\" I mean he got a $100 to give us the menus and act like an ass? You know something's wrong when the busser is top notch 5 star and the main/head waiter is a prick who disappears with \"the lads\" and chats at the bar all night when you run out of water, what 5 minutes for mains and have incorrect orders. No apologies no \"how is everything\" \n\nThe extremely disappointing part was the service and the attitude of the staff. Appalling. \n\nIt was a once in a lifetime style indulgence that failed to deliver. I won't be returning. \n\nFood: Delicious but not a WOW in any major way. \nService: Complete failure."

Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!\n\nGR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.\n\nWe had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.\n\nWhile waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.\n\nI was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.\n\nService was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.\n\nThey also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n--BREAD--\nOk, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!\n\n--DRINKS--\nPIMMS CUP: \nWasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.\n\nWYDERS PEAR CIDER:\nThe description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!\n\n--STEAKS--\nBEEF WELLINGTON:\nSo, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.\n\nKOBE FILET MIGNON:\nMy boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!\n\n--SIDE DISH--\nTRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:\nI LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!\n\n--DESSERT--\nSTICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!\n\nOverall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!"

It's loud, but all of Vegas is loud so we were happy we got to keep our reservations and try out gordan ramsays famous beef wellingtons.\n\nI tried finding reviews on yelp and other sights if this is a restaurant you can bring your kid in and while it's not made for kids the staff was very helpful and accommodating to all our needs. \n\nNow for the food. The hubby and I do not go out to expensive restaurants but we love Hell's Kitchen and wanted to try it out. I'm a burgers and fries kinda girl and the hubby likes everything so here are our thoughts on the food.\n\nBread-- yummy!!!! The best thing I ate by far. So much flavor in every bite... I'm sad we didn't get asked if we wanted more like other reviews had said.\nfoie gras--I couldn't eat it. Tasted like a chunk of fat to me. The hubby ate it with no problem. Licked it cleaned.\nEntree-- both got beef wellingtons. I think I enjoyed the carrots and pur\u00e9e better then the Wellington I guess I imagined it tasting better but it literally is just meat wrapped in pastry puff. The hubby loved it and ate my other portion.\nSides---mac n cheese, yummy but I can make better lol and fingerling potatoes... Good but tasted like something you can make at home.\n\nSo since the food here was good to me and not great why 4 stars? Because they were so accommodating to us with our infant and it's definitely worth a try."

Even though it came out way on the medium side it was as tough as the Red Lobster steak I used to eat when I was poor. I was absolutely disappointed. I cant even believe I was served such an awful piece of meat in that restaurant. The pork belly appetizer was pretty good and the chocolate peanut butter cake was to die for. But thats about it. The sides of Sriracha fried broccoli and shishito peppers were mediocre at best. Unfortunately,overall very disappointed."

Gordon Ramsay Steak in Las Vegas is THE best meal I've ever had in my life.\n\nAfter watching Hell's Kitchen, I made it my goal to eat at this restaurant. Luckily, I had planned a birthday celebration for a weekend and was able to snag a reservation to the restaurant with three of my friends and my girlfriend.\n\nComing into it, I can't really say that I knew what to expect. I was expecting good food, but this completely blew me away.\n\nFirst, the service. Our server's name was Matt, he was a very very friendly man. He introduced himself and explained how ordering drinks would work. Ordering drinks? How they work? Isn't it just...\"I would like this drink? Or, what is in this drink?\"\n\nNOPE! He whipped out an iPad (OOOOOOHHHHH!) and showed us the Gordon Ramsay Steak iPad Drink App. From this, we could choose various types of drinks and see what ingredients it had, what it would look like, and even build up a list of drinks we wanted to try. We could all just add this into a checkout menu and he could get us our drinks this way, or, if we wanted, we could order it in the traditional way. Very cool, very well done. \n\nOur server Matt then showed us the menu. He also pointed out that if we wanted, we could try a menu specially prepared by Gordon Ramsay. This would be a four course meal and we would get a souvenir menu with a photo of Gordon Ramsay cooking in it. We opted out of this, as this was too much food for us, but next time...I will give it a shot.\n\nA cart pulled up with various cuts of steak on it and a quick tutorial was given on what kind of cut was what. That was pretty cool. Matt seemed knowledgeable and answered our questions with ease.\n\nAfter discussing for a bit what we all wanted to eat, we finally decided on our choices. This was a steak house, so....it had to be something with steak.\n\nFour of us ordered two orders of the Beef Wellington for two, Chef Ramsay's speciality. To be perfectly honest, I had no idea what Beef Wellington would taste like, I just kept seeing it on the show and so really wanted to try it.\n\nOur sides included the Mac and Cheese (a favorite of the restaurant, Matt claimed), the creamed spinach, and Fire Corn.\n\nWe got a bread plate that was just amazing. Mushroom truffle bread, bacon bread, it was an amazing beginning to an epic meal.\n\nOH MY GOD. The Beef Wellington came out looking glorious. My knife cut through it and upon putting the first piece in my mouth, FLAVORASM. This is about as close to perfection as I imagine food could possible taste.\n\nThe sides were just as delicious. I'm a fan of corn, so the fire corn was my favorite, followed by the spinach and then the mac and cheese. All of it was cooked and seasoned to perfection and honestly, if I was forced to eat any of those sides for the rest of my life, I would live and die a very happy and wellfed man.\n\nEveryone dined in happiness and every other sentence out of our mouths was, \"OH MY GOD, THIS IS DELICIOUS.\"\n\nI've never been to a meal where more people were happy and kept voicing how delicious their food was. And it was. It was the most delicious meal I've ever had in my life, in my 27 years.\n\nThe staff was friendly and polite throughout the entire meal, apologizing when they had to reach over us to grab a plate to take away, bringin us new utensils when needed, refilling our water as often as needed.\n\nFinally, we finished our meal quite full. Matt comes up to our table and asks, \"Dessert?\"\n\nEven full, we knew what had to be done. We knew what must be said and what our next course of action should be. \"YES.\"\n\nDessert was a toffee cake (sorry, cannot remember the exact name) but the five of us split one. It was an amazing dessert and quite good with just two or three bites as it was quite flavorful and packed with awesome.\n\nWe finished up dessert and our server came up with the check. After paying, he asked us how our meal was and we responded quite honestly that it was the best meal we've ever had.\n\nHe was happy about that, we were happy and full, it was a good feel situation. However, what he said was surprising.\n\n\"Do any of you use Yelp? Someone gave us a low review and I'm making it my personal mission to get us back up to what we should be!\"\n\nI quickly agreed that this was a travesty and must be remedied. He asked if I would be willing to spend some time to write a review of this place, to let people know what I thought of the place. \n\nI have to say, when you eat at a restaurant where ever your host feels SO STRONGLY that he personally asks people if they would be willing to take the time out to review a place, that shows me that this is indeed a restaurant I will be returning to time and time again. With such a devoted staff, and such care for its customers, this place definitely deserves its 5 stars."

We were not disappointed!\n\nWe started with the smoked beef tartare, which was unbelievable.  The lemon zest and Yukon gold herb chips really take this dish to another level.\n\nFor entrees, I got the American Wagyu wrapped in bacon, and she ordered the beef wellington.  Both were excellent!  As sides, we added grilled shiitake and okra.  The sides were better than any I've had at a steakhouse.\n\nLast but not least, the toffee pudding with browned butter ice cream for dessert.  You can't miss out on this!  Order it, even if you think you don't have room.  Too good to pass up."

My bride & I were asked if we had a reservation.  No, we did not, so we were offered to be seated in the bar area and we took the offer.  Looking around, the space is tinted red, the tables are seemingly mirrors and the seats are actually pretty comfortable.  \n\nWhat I did not expect was a \"club\" atmosphere for an upscale steakhouse.  Club music was loud and more in the foreground than the background.  I understand this is Vegas and the city is a 24/7 party atmosphere, but come on... this is supposed to be an upscale restaurant.  The noise level made for difficult communication with our server and between ourselves.\n\nOther than being way overpriced, the food is pretty good.  The porterhouse was good, not spectacular, and not worth the $105 (for two).  The creamed spinach was awesome, and the loaded potato was a bit overdone, very very dry.  The wine by the glass selections were limited and very pricey.\n\nUnprofessional behavior from the male staff - whether management or not, patting the young gals (wait staff) in the bar area on the tush (remember how they're dressed from \"First impressions\"), or placing your hands on their hips as you're walking by them or in an attempt to get their attention or to get them to move so you can get into their space may seem acceptable at some level or even flirtatious, but it is very unprofessional in any restaurant at any level.  I must have been seated in one of the very few places in the bar area that a patron could witness these interactions.\n\nBased on my experience, and I've been to numerous upscale steak houses between the Mid Atlantic and central Texas, by comparison this one doesn't come close to being one of the better ones.  I can say I've tried it, and it's good - but not so good that it deserves any kind of hands down as good as it gets praise.  Mortons, Sullivans, The Palm (DC-Tysons) and many others offer much better quality food at slightly better prices.  GR, are you listening?  While it's okay, I cannot say I'm a fan when I think my money would be better spent at one or more of the previously mentioned places."

It wasn't even a decision when the menu came out. The waitstaff and hostesses were extremely friendly and accommodating. They definitely made us feel welcome, and transitioned our bar tab to our table bill easily. (I don't know why some restaurants make that so difficult)\n\nWe ordered a few drinks, (they ended up not charging us for our soda drinks and only charged us for our alcohol *score*) and for the appetizer we chose the lobster stuffed with chirozo. For our entree we ordered the beef wellington for two.\n\nThe lobster was amazing! It was a single lobster tail in a creamy sauce with chorizo in the center. The lobster was cooked perfectly and the chorizo not too salty. It took all of my will power not to lick the plate when we were finished.\n\nThen the entree came. We each took a minute to just look at our amazing dishes. We also ordered a side of potatoes but they were nothing to really talk about. Just pretty basic, they were good but basic. We ended up not finishing the potatoes. The wellington on the other hand was like food for the Gods. We each took a bite and closed our eyes to enjoy the rich goodness. The meat was cooked perfectly, the flaky crust was flavorful and not dry. Under the fillet was a bit soggy but we didn't care. We pretty much ate in silence after that. It was delicious, and super filling. \n\nWe definitely did not have room for dessert. Next time, I will be prepared."

The red saucing did not even PAIR up to the lamb, it was only for the plating looks, the lamb balls, with the lamb bone in it was awful, dried up lamb meatballs. The cappaccio was a disappointment, the hype about this place is so talked up, but the most disappointing dinner I have had on the blvd. Sad to leave feeling this way. I will definitely not be reccommending this place to anyone to try for a first time. Only thing decent about this place may be the overly bubbly servers trying to pitch the giant steaks, and thats about it. The Wellington is worth the \"try\" Since the fixtures hanging in the ceiling are a \"movement\""

I think that this is one of the better dining experiences in Vegas, even though it is really pumped up based on the fact that it has Gordon Ramsey's name on it.  I would bet that for every three star review that you see on this site, if that same person ate the same meal and had the same experience at any other steakhouse it would be a 4 or a 5 star meal.  People that come here expect the best meal of their lives based on the name, for some people GR Steak delivers.  For me it was a top 10 meal of my lifetime.  \n\nThe drinks were fresh and flavorful.  Some great pours by the bartenders as well.  When you pay $14 for a drink you are hoping to be satisfied, and I was.  \n\nI ate the bone in rib eye and it was one of the better steaks that I have ever had.  We also had the mac and cheese, baked potato which was huge, along with some mushrooms.  Their signature desert was also incredible.  You will be super full by the end of dinner, but it is worth it.\n\nThe service at this location was very interesting.  When you are first seated the hostess says something weird about a light that is Gordon Ramseys hands or something.  Very strange, but also unique.  Our server was pretty good, but we were also helped by someone named John B (can't remember his last name).  He said that he was a fairly new server assistant, but this guy made it a meal to remember.  He had a great personality, and knew everything about every course that was brought out.  He also recommended some great drink pairings."

I ordered the Bone In Ribeye which was good but wish they would have put a little more Heat on the outside to give it a nice Char.  To be honest the steak was a nice cut but the cook definitely underperformed.  The steak looked like it was cooked on a medium heat as there was very subtle difference in color on the outside.  Service was mediocre at best.  Typically at a high end restaurant where the dinner tab for 2 is close to $200 without drinks you shouldn't have to be asking for a refill on a water or waiting to have your plates taken away.  After finishing our dinner we literally sat idle for approximately 15 mins with Zero sign of our waitress waiting for a refill or the bill.  Actually had to flag down another waitress to get our bill and to have our plates removed from the table.  Maybe I caught them on an Off night or maybe it was because we were seated in the Lounge.  To be fair my wife loved her food, she ordered the Strip steak which she found to be very tender and good."

Every time they needed to serve a bottle of lower-priced wine (high priced wine is stored elsewhere) somebody came and put their butt in our face as they opened the closet to get wine out.  It's not really a closet -- it's a double-deep fancy glass door case, by the way.\n\nAnyway, we waited another 10-15 minutes for service.  We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing -- $220 a pop.  First few courses were mediocre.  Beef Wellington was awesome and the dessert was awesome.\n\nOverall -- not worth the price.  Good, but not great.  And certainly not a $500 dinner for two given the service and complete lack of ambience."

I expected to be blow out of my mind.  The Beef Wellington came out medium raw and it was very tender.  What i didn't like was that i felt like the layer between the  bread and the beef was so-so.  I'm not sure what the layer is, it was black and i felt like it was taking away from the taste of the beef.  The pastry part was made well and i enjoyed eating that.

She was so excited and I had made reservations 3 months in advance.  We got there and they stuck us in a back corner. The waiter introduced himself.  He was great at the start and full of personality.  We told him we had a couple of birthdays, he gave us our menus and told us that her bring us water and bread. 5 mins later he returned with a drink menu from an Ipad for beer/wine/cocktails.  It wasn't easy to use and you couldn't even order from it. That should be fixed Asap.  15 mins later we ordered our food and told the waiter we would like bread and water again.  10 min later water came then 10 min later we finally got the bread which was awesome.  Unfortunately, 5 mins later we got our dinner.  Dinner looked amazing but I was bummed that we didn't have more time to enjoy the bread and that my daughter was starving.  I ordered the beef Wellington, my bff got the short ribs and my daughter got the Kobe beef sliders. My bff decided she wanted a cheese platter too with dinner, she told the waiter to bring the dessert menu when he was placing our plates in front of us. It never came. The Waiter came 1 time after 20 mins of eating, we asked again .  He finally brings the dessert menu, she orders the cheese plate with cheeses that were listed on the menu. It took another 15 mins to get the cheese plate but the cheeses on the plate were different than listed on the menu.  She ended up sending it back because she wanted to try these new cheeses that were listed on the menu, not what was available that day. Apparently it changes but that was not noted on the menu at all.  To sum it up, the service was terrible for the price and expectation of a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  I'm still bummed for my daughter who thought it was going to be so special.... Live and learn."

I was a little apprehensive about going to a restaurant in the Paris hotel because I really like to stay at the cosmopolitan and other casinos of that quality.\nFirst off the valet parking situation there was a complete and utter nightmare I think they had one valet parker for about 150 cars. I have no idea how we ever got our car taken care of. After spending 20 minutes to get our car squared away we finally made it across the casino into the restaurant and were greeted by a gaggle of hostesses that look like they came out of a 1980s Peter Gabriel music video. \nI was immediately admonished for being late to my reservation. And told that the reservation is only held for 10 minutes and that it would be given away. But that she was going to let it slide this time and let me keep my reservation. ....She's very lucky she did so, because it would've been very unpleasant for her had she decided to go another way. \nWhen you first walk into the restaurant you go through this very cool tunnel, and it was explained to me by one of the little showgirl that this was to represent the Chunnel. One side being France and we are now entering England. Kind of cute and yet annoying at the same time.\n\nThe look of the restaurant was a major disappointment it was red and ugly and dated and had a spaghetti mess of neon overhead. I have no idea who designed that restaurant but honestly they should never design anything ever again. I found the room depressing. They should go visit the new restaurant Beauty and Essex. \nI really was not impressed with the food the best thing about the entire evening was the bread basket. \n\nOne of the most an incredibly annoying experiences I've ever had in a restaurant is the situation with the sauces. I mean Jesus Christ spend some money for some bigger ramekins. Everything comes out in a thimble size amount it is so obnoxious! We ordered french fries and we got a thimble full of Ketchup. I ordered fish and chips and being of British discent and fish and chips is always serve with malt vinegar and tartar sauce. I had to request both of them and it seemed like I had asked for something almost strange. Bloody hell!!!! what is the point of serving fish and chips if you don't serve it with malt vinegar and tartar sauce. And of course when it came out they were in these ridiculous tiny containers that maybe held a tablespoon, I wanted to scream!!!! The fish was served on a warm plate with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche that was literally dried to the plate by the time it got to me. It was so unappetizing. I felt all the plating was a major disappointment. I think the food was fine. \n\nThe cocktails were definitely above average. I had a acai martini that was fantastic. But I had to ask for a new drink because there was so much ice in the drink that there was barely any alcohol at all.\n\nThe high point of the evening was our server Alex he was a 10 out of 10. He was unbelievably helpful no matter what mistakes the kitchen made. He did everything he could to make up for it. What a huge asset this man is to the restaurant. I think that I would've really not enjoy the evening if it wasn't for him. I think one of the better restaurants in town should scoop this guy up because he is really outstanding!!!!!\n\nI probably would not come back to this restaurant. I feel like Gordon Ramsay have some other restaurants in town that I would try next time before returning. And I did not enjoy the overall vibe of the Paris."

We had the cheesecake and Apple Tart Tatin. However, my favorite part of the experience was the service.  Your server is always watching.  He or she doesn't come to your table a million times asking if everything is okay. They know whether it is okay or not because they are paying attention.

Unfortunately the man is a very busy man, so going to his restaurant is the closest thing I've got. \n\nService: They definitely lost a star because of the service. Our reservation was at 10:00pm, got there at 9:45pm and they weren't ready until 10:20pm. We waited at the bar area until my boyfriend went to ask about our table. And the hostess that followed him back to the bar laughed & said \"oh I thought it was just him, I didn't know you were waiting with him\". My boyfriend & I looked at each other with the \"um, okay?\" look. The waiter was also not very good. The only person I liked a lot was the server Devon. He helped me take pictures, refilled my water & checked up on us. \n\nFood: A-MA-ZING. obviously the restaurant is in Vegas so the prices are pretty expensive, but the main entrees are bomb! I ordered the King Crab legs and even though it was 4 pieces, it really fills you up. We also got the asparagus but it didn't taste as good as ones from other restaurants. Same goes for the mash potatoes. \n\nI'd recommend this place! BUT I would skip the sides and go straight for the gold. We definitely could have done it without the not-so-bomb sides."

Watching the entire season 10 of Hell's Kitchen made a visit to this restaurant while in Vegas a 'must do.\" Reservations seems to be required as every seating was booked. We arrived at 415 and waited in line for \"bar\" seats which still had views of the kitchen and our endeared winner, Christina. \n\nThe food was as good as the TV Show demands. I had the ravioli for appetizer.  The sunny side egg inside the hand made ravioli made for a neat surprise. The appetizer was new to my taste buds and tasty. The flavors were meant for each other, however the texture was a bid bizarre. \n\nI ordered the Beef Wellington for two. A signature and staple dish of Ramsey's, I've never actually had it. The beef was cooked perfectly- although medium rare is the only way it can be-- I like mine to be cooked a bit longer. The bread shell didn't stay on. I ordered the mac and cheese and the mushrooms. They complimented each other perfectly. The mac was very tasty, but I would order something else because nothing wowed me about it. \n\nThe desert was interesting but I would not repeat the order- Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was more like a toffee brownie and not like a pudding at all. The bottom was a bit burnt, barely, but overcooked indeed. The desert was served with a home made toffee icecream- displayed like a stick of butter??!! I wish I had something different. But worth the hype of trying! \n\nOverall, I loved the food, the service, and the view. Next time, I know, make reservations before my trip to Vegas, but will return again."

After the first two times, I thought it was awesome and would be back.  But not this time.\n\nI ordered the bone in New York, and my husband ordered the bone in Rib Eye and a lobster tail.  We shared the asparagus side, and we shared the mushroom side.  \n\nMy steak was horrible :(.  First, I was given a dull steak knife. Like as dull as a butter knife.  And my steak was full of gristle and veins, and of course it was bone in, so I had to struggle to hack away at my steak just to get some edible meat off of it.   My husband had the same problem with his steak, and of course his first bite had horrible thick gristle in it and had had to spit it in his napkin!!!  \n\nThe asparagus was bland, and a little too stiff and crunchy.  You couldn't taste the sauce they drizzled over the top.  My 14 year old daughter makes better  asparagus....  \n\nWanted to order a Pimms cup, but they were all out.  \n\nAnd to top it all off, we were sat at a table that was in a long row near the end of the kitchen.  One side was banquette seating, and the other side was a chair.  The tables were so close together, that my husband had to ask the people sitting next to us to hold their table when he stood up, in case he bumped it when he got up! I was sitting closer to the person at the table next to me than I was my husband.  I couldn't  hear a word he said, so of course if you talk loud enough to be heard, everyone else could hear your conversation too.  (And butt in!!!).   Seriously, give people a little privacy and elbow room while eating, and take one of the tables out and space them out better.  \n\nMight I also suggest that you bring the meat cart around to view cuts before we order???  What good does it do after??\n\nDidn't order dessert, I cannot have sugar and very few carbs.  \n\nI was very sad that I get a better steak (plus king crab legs) comped to us at our local casino in WA.  \n\nSorry Gordon.  You might want to come in undercover and have a meal here some time.  Heads would roll."

Warm greeting by hostess then went to the bar for a short wait had my wife had specialty martini that was greatly balanced and I had the Blue Chimney (one of my favorite beers). Then the hostess took us to our table but delivered our drinks which I thought was very good service. Once we sat, we were quickly greeted and brought water and introduced back to the drink menu which was on an iPad. We started with the flashed cooked clams. They were amazing! I have never had clams done that way and they were seriously melt in your mouth deliciousness! Let's talk about the bread...this isn't just a dinner roll...you get 4 different small breads each unique in flavor and texture. Our favorite was the prosciutto wrapped fig bread. WOW this was a knock out! It was just bread with bacon flavor with out the bacon. I told the bus boy how awesome it was and he packed us away 4 more for the road! Then we split the Market Greens salad which was full with flavor but not over dressed. Obviously we came for Gordons beef Wellington! I mean this is the best steak I've ever had. It just melted in your mouth but still flaky from the puff pastry outside. Since it was my wife's 30th bday, they brought us the Sticky Toffee pudding. Light, moist and full of delicious sweetness. Amazing. \n\nThe service was top notch  everything get set on the table at the same time. Bus boys were always cleaning our mess or bringing us more water and the servers are very knowledge about there food. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants the best dining experience. We come to Vegas a lot and we will be back just to eat here again. This is my first Yelp review for a restaurant because it really blew me away."

The first time was for the novelty obviously having seen his shows and been a fan. When I tell you that the food really is that good, it is why I have returned 2 more times.  I have actually gone and paid for the tasting menu each time I was here, crazy as that is. My Wife and I came here on Valentine's in 2015 and that was the only menu they had that night, which was fine.  Through the different tasting menus and the occasional extra, I have had, the Scotch Eggs, Oysters, Scallop Risotto, Lobster Ravioli, Bone Marrow, Beef Welling (If it is your first time here bite the bullet get this, it is a foodie experience), Sticky Toffee pudding and Chocolate Creme Brulee.  I have also had the wine paring twice, and on this last time they did an awesome play adding in beer in a couple of spots to go with the food, which was awesome. With so many places in Vegas it can be tough to decide, and there is always the concern, is this really worth the money. This place has never disappointed and is a wonderful evening if you are able to take your significant other."

The restaurant itself is accessed through the casino, as many in Las Vegas are. Decor is pretty good. They have very attentive staff here, which is good given the premium prices charged. The entree Chef Ramsay is best known for, Beef Wellington, will cost you over $50. Add in a salad or starter and a cocktail, and this is easily a $100+/person dining experience. I had a cauliflower curry soup which was really good. They actually present this soup with the scallops and roasted cauliflower in a bowl, and then the creamy curry soup is poured in over it. The breeds that you get here are good, too. I did go for the Beef Wellington here, and it was perfect. This was one of the best dishes I have ever had. The beef was extremely tender and flavorful and perfectly cooked medium-rare. Overall, this is a good establishment, though I felt it was priced too premium even for Las Vegas."

As an 18 top, our tables were split and we were seated on separate sides of the room.  We placed our order within minutes of the other table.  They had received their food within an acceptable ticket time, however, our table waited 1 hour and 25 minutes for our food.  The other table had finished their food as the staff was dropping our entrees.  My husband and I both ordered the bone in New York strip, each medium rare, a side of mushrooms and a loaded baked potato.  My steak came out medium well (maybe sat in the window) and his was medium rare.  The baked potato was mediocre and my mushrooms were incredibly over salted.  I will say the waitstaff was timely,  less the actual ticket time, especially with our drinks and were knowledgeable of both cocktails and the menu.  I will not be recommending the steakhouse nor would I waste our time or money ever going back.   I'm truly disappointed."

An empty stomach makes my heart suffer but the foie gras and cut of American Kobe beef tonight sparked an old lit candle.  I've forgotten the taste and the dream of having it again.  After the dream was given up, I became stubborn and didn't bother going to a Las Vegas Strip hotel to look for it but the dream still smothered the heart.  \n\nMake your reservation and ask for the booth that faces the line, best seats in the house.  Also allows you to cuddle closer together.  I would request to have Charles as the server, but I'm sure everyone is great.  When you arrive for your dinner, check in with the hostess and reaffirm the seats.  If you show up late you could lose your reservation or be made to wait after the current time reservations are seated.  And take care of your hostess.  After checking in you'll be brought to the lounge to wait for your table to be ready, she sipped on a Chateau Michelle's Eroica ($17) and I had a Blue Moon ($6) while waiting.  \n\nOur primary server was Adrian, then Charles became our secondary server.  Together they both gave the best service imaginable.  We ordered a second round of cocktail when the steak trolley came by and Adrian explained the specific cuts and aging process, my friend decided she wanted the American Kobe Beef Rib Cap ($58).  It was divine and rich in flavor, if they ever sell Japanese Wagyu I am coming straight back over here purely based on how professionally it was cooked.\n\nAppetizers!  We shared a half dozen oysters ($21), if you order this spread the caviar to all of the other oysters.  If you order more than one appetizer start with this.  Next came the Foie Gras ($25), WOW, I wanted to kiss everyone on the cheek around me!  You get a small side of bread before all of this and make sure to save two of those to lick up the remaining Foie Gras juice and sauce.  And we finally ended our appetizer with the Smoked Beef Tartare ($22), it is accompanied with chips.  When the server lifts the over of the dish, inhale the smoke!  \n\nYou will find steakhouses in Las Vegas which can be considered masterpieces, a work of art and Charles introduced us to Executive Chef Kevin Hee who has elevated this steakhouse through his menu.  It was a pleasure to meet and chat briefly with Chef Hee, I can almost immediately tell he was from Hawaii (where I'm from!).  I knew how valuable his time was so we kept it crisp like the underlying of the Foie Gras.  Seriously could not stop thinking of that, I wanted another Foie Gras but for dessert.  \n\nIn between the appetizer and main entree, we refreshed our palate with the HK's Acai Antioxidant ($11 each), thank you so much Charles!  The HK Acai Antioxidant has Acai Liquor, lemon, and delicious juicy blueberries dropped in with the ice.\n\nThe tendency to overlook critical detail is not shown here at Gordon Ramsay Steak at all.  I, too, ordered the Beef Wellington ($54) as my main entree.  And as many times as this item has been created on TV and in this juggernaut of a restaurants, it came out perfect.  It is only made in one temperature by the way, but how else would you have it.  It takes 45 mins to be prepared so if you're in time constraints keep that in mind.  The sides we had was the Mac and Cheese ($13), made with blue cheese and truffle which was amazing; sauteed Mushrooms ($13), made with scallions and bonito flakes that moved and crumpled up but by far my favorite side dish due to the seafood taste to it; and finally the deep fried Tempura Haricot Vert ($12).\n\nSave room for dessert!  We shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($12) and melted in its genius.  My friend who I shared the dining experience with tonight has worked at multiple Michelin star restaurants as their pastry chef, agreed with me this was a perfect dessert.  The way I felt after this meal, this was the perfect birthday celebration.  CUT steakhouse was my favorite and if anyone was to ever get serious about eating steak, stop by GR Steak."

My girlfriend and I are HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans and have been so for many years, but sadly, we've never been able to experience his cuisine.  It was exactly that, an experience.  The food was absolutely mind-blowing only to be tied with the unbelievable service we received from server (and when I say server, it was more like conductor of a fine symphony), Matthew K.\n    Upon entering through a London Underground like tunnel, the restaurant opens up into a beautifully stylized modern steakhouse.  While waiting for our table, we sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender sporting two iPads with interactive drink menus.  Wow.  The drinks were as fantastic as the presentation.\n    We were seated shortly after ordering our drinks, and greeted by a cheery, fun-spirited server named Matthew.  That's when the real fun started.  Seeing our enthusiasm to see what Gordon had to offer, he recommended to us we try the limited edition tasting menu which featured a variety of tasting courses with the Beef Wellington as the main.  For the sake of keeping this review under 30 pages describing the beauty of each dish we were served, I'll say that EVERY course was even more amazing than the last.  We even added an extra course of the \"fish and chips\" (which calling that fish and chips is like calling Las Vegas itself just a city).  If I really had to pick two favorites, it would be the asparagus soup and of course the beef wellington.  Lastly, I am NOT a dessert eater, but the Tropical Panna Cotta just about blew me out of my chair and across the room.\n    The entire evening left us floating about a foot off the ground between the atmosphere, food, and service.  Completely made our entire weekend.  We will be going back  again and again and can't wait for the new GR pub opening in Caesar's this fall!\n\nThanks Gordon & Matt!!!"

We love some of his other restaurants on the strip and love Gordon Ramsay.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed in our experience.  The services was just \"OK\".  The food we found was just mediocre.  We had slow roasted ribs and the lamb duet.  For the price and given the fact it was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, we really expected more.  \n\nI have a pork allergy and made sure our waitress knew.  Not exactly sure what food came in contact with pork, but I had an allergic reaction to my meal.  The waitress was semi-apologetic.  We didn't see the manager once.\n\nWe will never eat here again.  There are numerous other restaurants that have better food and a better experience."

            "review": "Was really looking forward to a great evening-- so disappointed. We booked a month in advance for a party of 6 and when we arrived were led upstairs to a table in the corner of a very small, closed in banquet room. The walls were beige on beige with absolutely no decor, no ambiance whatsoever. My dining room at home is more inviting than this! When we asked to be moved to the main dining room we were told that they don't have tables for 6 in the main room. They then proceeded (the waiter-because the hostess didn't care & was clueless) to move us to another small equally blas\u00e9 banquet room with a window. We now had somewhat of a view of the casino. I guess it was better, but I sure couldn't tell we were at Gordon Ramsey's! I have to say that the night was now over. There was just no way the food was going to compensate for this. Although, it was good, it was nothing better/or as good as what you would get at Delmonico or CarneVino. We are a foodie family and that week alone dined at Ramsey's, Michael Mina, Jaleo by Jose Andres and a really cute place in Summerlin called Honey Salt. (we are locals) We spent over $900 in each of the first three restaurants, so paying for good food and atmosphere isn't unusual for us. I wanted to complain to the restaurant itself, but nowhere on their website is that possible. Just a very disappointing, frustrating experience which could have been avoided had we been told about the table situation when the reservation was made. Won't go back-ever!"

Soooooooo the wait.......45 minute wait with reservations ended up eating close to 11 pm. \n\nThat said the specialty drinks were nice. Not great. The Hell's Kitchen drink was good but very weak and the strawberry martini was like any other. Sugar inside Paris has better drinks. \n\nThe hostesses are a little aloof and you have to stay on top of them or they will forget your table! The wait staff however was so well trained. Professional but not snooty enough to not know how to deal with star struck diners. Ipads as menu's is a little much but it added to the cutting edge London vibe of the place. I kinda likened the inside to a flash back from Austin Powers but with a very modern vibe. \n\nAlright now the food. It was sooooo late I couldn't order my beef wellington b/c it was about a 45 min wait for one. I didnt want to eat anything too heavy either and ended up getting an appetizer as an entree I got the chorizo stuffed lobster tail.Tiny.....and chorizo stuffed is really more like a chorizo broth. My bf on the other hand didnt mind eating a pound of meat near midnight. He got the new york strip steak and a side (Which I absolutely can't remember??? potatoes maybe? uneventful in any case) He ordered the steak medium it was defintley medium rare....a little black and blue with too much char for my taste but he enjoyed it. And we split the Blue Cheese Mac n Cheese as an appetizer. The mac was AMAZING. The best mac I have EVER had in my whole life. Last we had a toffee pudding with caramel sauce. It was super late so we took most of it home in the cutest to go bags. It too was pretty amazing. \n\nIn summation. Waiters great. Hosts lame. Bartenders (oh cause you'll be sitting there a while) are more interested in their tips than anything else. Food is good but pricey. For the price you pay I prefer Mesa's (Mr. Flay's) steak. it was about 175 for two people, two apps one side a dessert and two drinks oh and a bottle of water ;) nice experience though"

            "review": "I have avoided writing this review for some time because I'm worried it won't be good enough, perfect enough to explain just how good this restaurant is. I have to say up front that I an an unapologetic whore for Gordon Ramsay- I'm one of those people you will overhear at a cocktail party saying \"Oh no the BRITISH kitchen nightmares is so much better...\", I make all my friends watch The F Word on youtube, and probably have some weird form of Stockholm Syndrome for him. It's a lot of pressure to live up to- but now it's time to face my demon. \n\nThis restaurant blew me away. BLOWN. I have been to super fancy expensive restaurants and I have been to high priced steak houses, but this is the first time at a steakhouse where they actually carried over all the snooty elements of fine dining and executed it perfectly with the steak theme. It's even inside the Paris- the most unjustifiable snooty casino on the strip!\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cool inside- from the decor to the place-mats to the knives and forks- everything about it is sleek, fancy, and solid. This isn't an exaggeration, I actually considered purchasing the leather place mats they serve everything on (and it turns out they do in fact sell them). It's a little bit louder than you would expect at a rest of the world fine dining restaurant but actually quieter than the average Vegas restaurant full of wooo girls so try and control yourself while eating. \n\nThe Staff- so fancy. I was dressed nice but the waiter outfits actually made me feel like a bit of a slob. The staff is great- I am a bit of a stickler on drink refills and I don't think my water glass ever got more than 2 sips down before someone swooped in to refill it- that's quality service. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the different kinds of meat, what ingredients were in the side dishes, and didn't even get visibly annoyed at the barrage of questions he was faced with. \n\nOk onto the food. First of all- the bread is legit. They have a bacon/fig brioche that is preposterously good- make sure you order lots of extra as they may try and trick you by only bringing one for the table- everyone will want their own. \n\nThe cocktails- I have had a few... That may or may not have influenced my positive review (trixy hobits). My favorites are the Side Car and the Drifter (they change this sometimes but all the bourbon drinks have been good- and helloooooo giant ice ball I can swish around in my glass for an air of faux sophistication\n\nAs per steak list guidelines I always get bone in ribeye, potato side, mac and cheese- but there is a sub rule to this that many people don't know about and that is \" if there is a pork belly appetizer- order it\". \n\nPork belly- hot damn this was good. It comes with cheesy grits and a tomato jam which sounds like waffle house (covered with ketchup) but I apologized in my head for that comparison the second I tasted it- its good. \n\nRibeye- this was fantastic. It had an almost rock hard crust on the outside that was nice and salty. Despite this torched exterior the inside was a very dark pink/almost red color after being ordered medium rare. Even the outer edges /fat of the steak had been seared deliciously. It was incredible. And also it was served very hot, which is my preference. \n\nMac and Cheese- nailed it. A lot of truffle mac and cheeses are basically garbage- its some fancy cheese that doesn't melt well with random bread on top and then doused in truffle oil. Not so here- all the flavors went together perfectly, and the mac had clearly spent actual time in an oven as not only was the top crust crispy but many of the noodles on top were also crunchy- something I like. \n\nPuree- yes this has CRAAAAIM FRAIIIIIICHE in it- and it is amazing. It is so smooth it almost boggles the mind. It is almost like a sauce- and yes you can dip your steak in it and it's incredible. \n\nDessert\nThe first time I got a cheese cake and it was probably the best dessert I have ever had. Many cheese cakes come with a strawberry sauce on top of them- pretty standard. This one came with a strawberry sorbet on top - and the temperature and texture of that sorbet took cheese cake to a whole different level. \n\nThe coffee- ORDER IT. It comes with 3 spoons that are a combination of chocolate and liquor for you to mix in. \n\n\nIn closing, haters gonna hate- if you really didn't enjoy this restaurant I assume you are some sort of comedic foil who exists just to troll the rest of tasteful humanity."

The small amount of caviar help boost the flavor but it was just not enough.  On the other hand the Onion soup was over powering with a onion/salty flavor.   I wanted to mix the two together.  Our Steaks were very good, I thought the sear was close to being burnt but it was definitely better than Delmonico.  The biggest problem is the atmosphere,  It said business casual but people were walking around in T-shirts and shorts.  I know it Vegas but it is suppose to be a 5 star restaurant.  The music was way to loud.  I came to enjoy my dinner and not feel like I was in a night club.  The waiter and the rest of the staff were fantastic and he did apologize for the noise.  He said that several other guest have said the same.  I was surprised the manager did not come to our table after we said something about the music.  I you dont mind load music while you eat this would be a place to have a good meal.  If you want the whole experience of fine dinning go to \"THE CUT\"."

The overall surroundings look similar to what it looked like when Les Artiste use to inhabit the location with the exception of a tunnel like hall and a lounge in the bar area where a large table use to exist.  The neon overhang is pretty cool too.\n\nExcellent customer service is offered at Ramsay's.  I've been here twice now on two separate occasions with two different servers and I'm quite impressed.  My only warning for the newly initiated is that you just get plain tap water when they ask you for sparkling or still...$8 a pop otherwise.  On my first visit my table accidentally ordered bottle after bottle thinking the still water was plain water...NOT so.  Five bottles later...oh boy.  We might as well fork out for some more wine.\n\nGreat steaks.  The ribeye is my favorite but they have Kobe cuts that will melt in your mouth.  It's much pricier however, as is the caviar.  To save on price, order sides with your dish like the foie gras or bone marrow (no bread to neutralize the oiliness of the marrow however).\n\nThe main reason I like this place though is their toffee bread pudding (award winning according to our server)...YOU CANNOT MISS OUT ON THIS!  Save room for dessert.\n\nOh yeah, their complimentary bread is killer.  If you ask nicely they will pack you a few to go."

First, the hostess that took our reservation didn't enter it properly into their system so when we showed up they tried to seat us in the lounge. I had to speak to two different hostesses and then their manager before we were given a table in the restaurant. Then for an appetizer we ordered the seafood platter. There are two options here, the small and the large, and we ordered the small. The waiter asked if we wanted any wine and we said we'd stick with beer. The food came out and 10 minutes after we started to eat, the waiter came back out and said \"I've got some bad news, I accidentally ordered the large seafood platter, which is considerable more expensive, but I'd like to comp you a bottle of wine\". So he was asking us to pay for the larger dish, which we didn't order and for our trouble would give us a bottle of wine, which he already knew we didn't want. He didn't put up too much of a fight when I told him we weren't interested, but at a top-tier restaurant something like that should never ever happen."

We had 7 waiters (yes 7) which was not overbearing but you never had to ask for anything; and where treated like royalty. \nWe went all in and ordered a appetizer, wine, main course, ala cart sides, and desert.\nThe appetizer was a jumbo shrimp cocktail, paired with a glass of moscato wine. When picking your steak the staff will wheel over a display showing every single style/cut of steak the offer!!! We had to go with the Kobe Ribeye. My god I have never ate a steak like that in my life. Sides and desert where amazing and a meal in it self. Plan on leftovers which will taste better reheated than most other steakhouses. Pricing is on the higher side which is appropriate given the service and quality. \nWe wont hesitate flying 2hrs just for dinner here!!! Cant wait to come back!!!!"

The first course was a Scotch Egg (Quail egg) that was surprisingly delightful and light, followed by the Onion soup we substituted with the Beet Salad that normally accompanies the menu. Next was an amazing Scallop Risotto- made with peas. The Risotto was cooked perfectly, and neither of us minded the peas as much as we thought we would because the dish was delicious. The scallop was cooked flawlessly and had the perfect texture and seasoning. The main course was Beef Wellington (the reason we chose to dine here) and it is now my number two steak ever! The pastry covering the tender filet was light and flakey and did not have the doughy heavy consistency I have had in the past at other places offering this dish. The steak was medium rare but that is exactly how I prefer my steaks and for this dish having it more well done would ruin it! For dessert: hands down best dessert ever, and I am quit particular about what I truly consider having if I have dessert. We had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and Brown Butter Ice Cream. I literally have a new addiction!!! The ice cream alone is an experience, but coupled with the toffee pudding, it's magical! I actually told a friend I had my first intimate experience with food tonight, and my hubby agrees- this dessert is a MUST try for anyone having dinner here! Loved our dinner tonight."

            "review": "We just came here last week on the Vegas part of our honeymoon.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of not making reservations in advance and there weren't any tables left for the last couple of nights we would be there.  We couldn't leave Vegas without eating here so we opted to eat in the lounge/bar area which was still a nice atmosphere and provided us with a slightly more snug, but comfortable table after letting a few people pass us in line.  The only downside was the wait of 1hr+ to be seated, but it was barely noticed since we were enjoying watching Christine in the kitchen.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Chianti from the Ipad cocktail menu.  The prices were very reasonable and they provide a great selection of bottles from average to premium.  Since we were advised that we would be waiting at least 45 minutes for our entrees, we decided to order a couple of cocktails to start.  The Ipad came in very handy since it provided images as well as ingredient lists for each drink.  My wife ordered a Mojito, which wasn't on the menu and it was far too sweet for both of our palates.  I ordered an English Garden, which was an excellent cocktail containing Hendrick's, basil, lemon, cucumber.  It was definitely the best use of gin that I have ever experienced in a drink.\n\nOur meal started with a bread basket containing about 5 different varieties of bread.  The most notable were the 2 brioche, but the one containing pancetta specifically stood out.  We then followed up with an order of Short Rib Tortellini with foie gras, which was so good that my wife and I are still talking about it. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the bone-in strip loin with a bone marrow sauce and my wife ordered Gordon's acclaimed Beef Wellington, also the reason for our 45 minute wait which was well worth it.  My strip was cooked perfectly and was defintely one of the best steaks that I have ever had.  The bone marrow sauce was rich and added a lot of flavour, although I found if too much was used it overpowered the meat.  My wife's Beef Wellington was phenomenal; it was a beautifully tender piece of meat that could almost be cut with a fork alone surrounding by a perfect amount of light pastry.\n\nEven though we were both feeling fairly full at this point, we couldn't leave without trying Gordon's highly-renowned Sticky Toffee Pudding.  It was one of the most decadent desserts that either of us have ever tried.  The Brown Butter Ice Cream that it was served with could have stood up on it's own as a phenomenal dessert, but complimented the pudding perfectly.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend going to Gordon Ramsay Steak if you're in Vegas.  I know that any of our visits in future will include a dinner here, as well as reservations made well in advance."

That guy -- the one from the U.K. show -- is awesome. I've briefly met Ramsay and gotten a couple of his cookbooks signed. But I've never eaten at a Ramsay restaurant.\n\nI had an evening to myself in Vegas but didn't really have the budget for a full-on expensive meal so I thought I would try to visit GRS to try something, just to have had the experience. \n\nAs a solo diner, they seat you at the bar. No problem -- nice bar, great service. I ordered the Onion Soup. While I was waiting, a couple of locals sat down and it was there first time at Steak, as well. We chatted a bit. More on them later. \n\nThe Onion Soup was stellar. Thick and slick and full of flavor. On the bar menu, they had a lower priced Fois Gras that came with in-house made English Muffins and jam. For a week or so, I dreamt about those English muffins. Forget your nooks and crannies, these were smaller than what you're used to but crisp on one side Fois Gras was amazing and the whole thing worked as a weird sort of PBJ assemblage. \n\nThe couple next to me turned out to be the nicest people in the world They offered a couple of bites of their steak. I refused. They insisted. Okay! Sold! Two bites of the best steak I've ever tasted. Perfect, really. They also give me a sample of their dessert, which had a pour-on chocolate of some kind. Hi, diabetic coma!\n\nI ordered the coffee for desert. I thought it would be coffee. But no! It was French press coffee PLUS 3 spoons with chocolate labeled A B and C. Inside the spoons were were Amaretto, Bailey's and Chambord. You dip the spoon in the coffee, the chocolate melts and the liquor goes in the coffee. Amazing presentation.\n\nThis was a totally worthwhile experience. Incredible meal, great service. Well played."

There is nothing that this man has done that has made his steaks worth the $50, $70, even $95 price point!  And this is just a 6 oz cut of beef mind you, not a dinner, not sides, or a few pieces of arugula paired with a demure wedge of tomato. All of that's extra. \n\nI wasn't impressed, but I also wasn't paying. If you find yourself in this delightful situation, order the group-appetizer that comes on the octopus platter.  Every type of prawn, oyster, and tiny sea creature of the soft and hard shell variety comes on that platter.  Being a seafood person, I got down 'n dirty in my little glittery dress.  Now the octopus platter, I was impressed with.  The steaks, take em or leave em.  It should be called, Gordon Ramsay Octopus Appetizer.  But maybe that would put people off."

Our expectations were high, and we were not disappointed.  \nNestled in the Paris casino, you are first guided by your hostess through a contemporary neon tunnel (arduously described in unnecessary detail of how it represents the tube in London.) The decor itself was comfortably simplistic.  Cocktails were perfectly built and presented in stylish glassware. The sleek and balanced silverware indicated an attention to detail appreciated by my party.\nThe \"Hell's Kitchen\" tasting menu was offered, and although cliche, included everything my friend wanted to try.  We almost hit a snag when they informed us that the entire table must order the tasting menu, which in a restaurant of this size and at full capacity, I was at a loss to understand the reasoning, other than feeling a bit gouged. But, if looked upon as entertainment, we all wanted to see the show, and set out on the prix fixe excursion together. Christopher, our waiter added the right amount of sardonic wit that complimented the food with flair. The staff was attentive and professional without being pretentious. The dinner itself was outstanding, perfectly prepared, and full of flavor, particularly the Beef Wellington.  Although I thought it was a bit exorbitant, the experience is one I would recommend to anyone at least once."

Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.  \n\nI had the infamous beef Wellington, which I've never had before.  The pastry was soggy underneath the meat, and the meat was so flavorless.  The boyfriend had the rib cap, which was to DIE for!  If given the opportunity to go back, this would be my number 1 choice.  We ordered the bone marrow along with truffle mac n cheese.  Bone marrow tasted like raw beef fat and has a very unpleasant array of green herbs placed on top (pestoish).  The Mac n cheese was really just ok.\n\nAs for dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding.  OMG!!!  Best thing hands down.  I would go back just for that dessert alone.

We wanted to go for the tasting menu just for the scallops and risotto but couldn't get ourselves to spend $400 on dinner ($150 a person plus tax, drinks and gratuity). We started out with the Mac and cheese which was phenomenal! The table bread deserves a mention bc it was so good. Our waiter was great, his name was Anthony, he was very attentive and knowledgeable. Even gave us a short show on different cuts of meats and refilled us on which table bread we liked the best (the ham one and the baguette one) while we waited for our food. I got the chicken which was delicious, especially the crispy skin dumplings, had mash instead of whatever it came with. My husband got the beef Wellington and he loved it. For dessert we got the highly recommended sticky toffee pudding which was amazing and actually the same as the one at the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill at the Caesars which we had the night before. Our bill was just under $175 with tax and tip (no alcohol). The decor was very nice and cozy and dim. A bit of London right in the Paris, all while in Vegas!"

One member of our party has an allergy to wheat/gluten.  We expected a highly rated restaurant such as this is would be able to accommodate as well as any other.   We were wrong.  Our waiter seemed to not understand what we were talking about with gluten free.   After getting the impression that he didn't really get it, and couldn't point out anything on the menu that we could order for the allergy we asked to speak to either a chef or manager who might be better able to help us.  He explained the chef would be too busy to speak with us but sent one of the managers.  The manager was more knowledgeable and pointed out several options that could be made to gluten free.  So we ordered based on his recommendations.  First the waiter comes up 10 minutes after ordering and lets us know that the chef has told him the brussel sprouts are cooked off earlier in the day and can't be made gluten free.   So we order a different side.  When the entrees arrive we find the Fish that was supposed to be gluten free - the sauce was not, so they left it off entirely.  This would have been nice to know ahead of time instead of here's everyone's food you have some plain fish.  The beef wellington another party member ordered was overcooked.  We didn't send any of it back because we had a show to catch and wouldn't have time for it to be redone.  We did pass on our experience to the manager who checked in after we were done eating.  All in all, most food was delicious, but he experience left a lot to be desired for the price paid."

Which leads me to the biggest gripe. The food is average for a \"fine dining establishment\" yet 30% higher in price, with crappy service.

He had been talking about it for weeks. I, on the other hand, had no interest in it because I'm a really picky eater and I wasn't going to pay $125 a person to eat 1 of the 5 courses (at best). When he tried to order it for just himself he was informed that in order to do the tasting menu everyone at the table had to also to do it because of some lame \"the chef wants it blah blah blah\" ok, well if I'm paying I don't really care what the chef wants me to do, but thanks a lot.\n\nHe was super upset, but there was no way I was ordering it, so he attempted to order everything off the tasting menu separately from the regular menu to get as close to the tasting menu as possible. He ordered the beef wellington, the sticky toffee pudding, and they did allow him to order a scotch egg separately so he could try it. So he really only missed out on the beet salad (ew) and the scallop appetizer, of which he ordered pork belly instead.\n\nI ordered the filet mignon, a side of the yukon mashed potatoes, the mac n cheese, asparagus, and bernaise sauce.\n\nThe food was all good, but nothing was GREAT except the bernaise and the mac n cheese. My husband enjoyed the wellington, but I could tell it wasn't as good as he had been hoping for. He also enjoyed the egg, and at only $3 I couldn't believe they didn't rip us off for $10 LOL.\n\nThe other sides were good, but again, not amazing, same with my steak. I've definitely had better. The sticky toffee pudding was very good and a large size (definitely big enough to share) and for $15 it should have been.\n\nThe service was also fine.\n\nWe don't regret trying this place, but for the $300 price tag after tax and tip that it cost us, I don't think we'd return."

I have never been offered that at any steakhouse...it is my new way to order it...it was cooked all the way through, no pink (no fun for most people but just the way I like it)...all the while not compromising the juice factor and the flavor. Oh, the melt in your mouth flavor! My husband ordered the rib eye cooked medium and it was perfection on a plate! The potato puree was like the world's best mashed potatoes! Rainbows and unicorns appear when you put a forkful in your mouth and tranquil music plays as they melt on your tongue. The drinks were amazing...something about the special glasses  they choose for each made them taste that much better! We finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the peanut butter something or other...they were delectably delicious!

This was great since I was starting to get sick and i wanted to go home soon after eating! The hostess seated us after walking through a cool tunnel and told us about the red lights which we were seated under saying it was the movement of Gordon's hands when he makes the Wellington. \nThe waiter came right away to take drink orders and he was great the rest of the night with the rest of our meal. We knew exactly what we wanted but we still had him come show us the cool display of meats! :p\nFor the appetizer we had the gnocchi because we figured Gordon can't mess up gnocchi and we were correct! This is by far the best gnocchi both my boyfriend and I have had! There were probably only like 6 pieces of gnocchi on there but they were the best little things I've ever tasted along with the 10 leaves and a few shreds of cheese! It was the sauce that brought it all together. The side was so good that I wanted to lick the plate after (I refrained). \nNext up, we had a beef Wellington to share. I thought it wouldn't be enough for my large appetite but I was wrong! This was more than enough! During the main course, my sickness got worse and I wasn't able to taste anything half way through my Wellington! I got a good taste of it in the beginning and it was very moist and juicy as it should be. The pastry was a bit buttery for me though. I think I could have done without the pastry (but that's just a steak). \nI wish I could have ended the meal with his sticky toffee pudding but I was so full and slightly incapable of tasting anything at this point that I didn't waste money on something I wouldn't be able to taste! The service was top notch and was very welcoming and attentive. This always adds to the experience."

Both my brother and my father had chance to visit Gordon Ramsay Steak on different occasions and they both spoke the praises of this venue. Granted both of them are Gordon Ramsay fans so who can question their loyalty. The only true measure was to eventually try it myself. \n\nMy wife and booked a reservation prior to our most recent trip in July of 2014 to Vegas. We actually were looking forward to this experience to see if everything measured up to the stories we had been told. The restaurant was busy and naturally our table wasn't quite ready so we were ushered into the bar area. This seems to be a common staging practice in many fine restaurants. We ordered a couple drinks that were absolutely amazing. Strawberry martini's prepared right before us and went down easy. Obviously fresh ingredients and a great amount of care went into mixing each drink,\n\nWe, rather quicky, got our table and were given an opportunity to look at the menu. The offerings where tightly controlled and we did not feel overwhelmed. The table side meat presentation was very different and added to the mystique of the place; really showing a restaurant that wants to stand out. The waiter gave a great presentation on the meat selection and left us to make our final decisions. \n\nI ordered the New York Stip with bone in, and my wife had the Ahi Tuna. If you have ever been to a 4 or 5 star steak house you know that there are good steaks and there are great steaks. Not meaning to offer up any offence but there are many that will hold a steak from the Keg up as a standard. Try a steak from a place like Gordon Ramsay's and the bar will be raised; and it truly was. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy a great steak from the Keg as much as anyone, and no I cannot afford to eat at 5 star restaurants. Once a year we save up for a trip to Vegas and a part of that trip is to enjoy a really great meal. If there is one thing you should do is take some money and set it aside for a truly delectable meal. It is an experience that really can change your perceptions. \n\nGordon Ramsay Steak did just that, it changed our perceptions. We felt the hype was truly in line with what was offered. We truly enjoyed the experience and I am confidant you will too, I highly doubt any item on the menu will disappoint. \n\nGive the hype a try! In this case it tastes wonderful."

Hostesses and servers were on point all night rounding out this fantastic dining experience. While everything  on the menu was great the beef Wellington stood out as being some of the most tender and flavorful steak I have ever eaten."

That was understandable; we waited a little too late to call as it was a last minute trip to The Strip. When we got to the Paris hotel, we decided to walk past the restaurant to check it out. My husband is in culinary school and is impressed with Gordon Ramsey's high standards of service. The line for us happened when we were outside the restaurant looking in. A couple walked past and the hostess at the stand outside asked them if they'd like reservations to eat there that night, on Saturday, when this couple didn't even approach the stand. With such high standards, we did not expect to be denied a reservation when they obviously had space available, as evidenced by the hostess asking passers by to eat there! Left us with a bad taste in our mouths; my husband was very disappointed. Won't be going to a Ramsey establishment any time soon. Ate at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar instead."

This place is recommended for celebrating a special occasion or romantic date. The bar waiting area inside is comparable to a comfy lounge & unique in that the menus are ipads. \n\nYou click on your drink and it is quickly brought over by a sexy cocktail server. The waiter was so friendly and flamboyant, he made my night. He explained the specialty of the house and a large meat wheel to describe the variety of steaks. \n\nOur first course was the foie gras and it was delectable. .. the spinach and mashed potatoes were creamy and savory. The new york steak was buttery and tender. I loved everything about this place and would highly recommend it without reservation. Dinner and drinks for two was around $300"

Thank you Hanna for all of your help that evening, you were wonderful and we so appreciate it! \n\nThe cocktails were impressive and handcrafted with care, the atmosphere was elegant, simple and classic and the food was amazing!

Our family is total fans of Hell's Kitchen and could not wait to experience this restaurant.  My sister made the reservation, and for our party, a deposit was required. \n\nThe entire staff that we encountered was exceptional, friendly and fun.  We were escorted to a private dining room (there were 14 of us).  It was intimate,  we were able to toast the newlyweds in private, and tell stories and laugh.  \n\nThe music was perfect, lighting was awesome, and our server Matthew could not have treated us better.  Our champagne server was Steve. All of the serving staff was professional and quick.  The timing between the courses was perfect.  \n\nAfter watching  soooo much Hell's Kitchen, I could not wait to order the Beef Wellington to see what all the fuss was about.  Oh....I'll tell you, the \"fuss\" is that Beef Wellington is dang amazing.  I had the Primm's Cup drink with my dinner, and it was worth it.  Refreshing, and crisp, and I got a little buzz on.  The sticky toffee cake is a MUST....a MUST I tell you!!! \n\nAnd not only was our dinner and service amazing, but we received and extra special visit from Hell's Kitchen winner and head chef Christina Wilson!! By the end of our time at Gordon Ramsay's Steak, we felt like family there...and then.. we got the bill....just joking, it was totally worth the $$...$$$ :)\n\nAll in all, this experience was 10 stars.  It was a perfect ending to an already perfect day.  My gorgeous sister and her new husband had a beautiful wedding and I was honored that they invited us to share in their special day.  I would, without a doubt, recommend this restaurant to everyone."

It turned out prefect because our server asked about our plans for the evening & we told him we had a show to catch at 9 so he planned the timing of our courses. They took their time & brought everything out at a prefect time! Loved it! That was so thoughtful of them!\n\nI have to say we had the best time, meal & service at Gordan Ramsay Steak during our short stay in Vegas! The atmosphere was nice & dim even though it was a little loud in there. We had oysters on the half shell, foie gras, ribeye, lamb, truffle fingerling potatoes, asparagus, bone morrow & the sticky toffee pudding. \n\nOysters were prefect! There were 3 different kinds of oysters & it came with 3 different sauces to top off. The foie gras was amazing! It was our first time having foie gras. I've seen what it looked like but wasn't sure how the taste & texture was. We loved it & will definitely have it more often! The foie gras had a nice sear on the outside & it came with 2 small pop overs that had gooseberries & gooseberry sauce. It was delicious! Everything paired so nicely! The ribeye was cooked to perfection! There was a nice char on the outside from the grill & the inside was nice & medium rare, how we ordered it. It didn't come with sides so we ordered the truffle fingerling potatoes - it was just ok to me & the asparagus -this was delish! Cooked perfectly! The lamb came with 1 lamb chop, a small Shepards pie, roasted carrots & mashed potatoes. Loved everything except the pie was too salty for me. The bone morrow was just ok. I've had better. I didn't care for that green sauce on top. Not even sure what it was. The dessert, sticky toffee pudding was to die for!!!!!! It was like a small cake & they poured toffee sauce on top & it came with brown butter ice cream shaped like a stick of butter. Heaven!! Soooooo good! The coffee came in a french press & they even provided 3 complimentary chocolate spoons (had alky in it) to stir into your coffee. I passed on that since I'm pregnant but hubby tried it. Be careful, he said it was pretty sweet so you might not want to use all the chocolate.\n\nVery pricy but definitely a must try, at least once."

My husband with another couple booked this reservation 3 months in advance since we have been excited to try this restaurant for 2 years. We arrived to our reservation on a high note from walking off a craps table with winnings near $1000, we were sad to walk away from the table but excited for dinner (should have stayed playing craps!) it took the waitress 5 minutes to greet us and offer the water selection which we selected tap. They have a tray of the cuts of meat they wheel around to explain our options that they stick in a corner to store rather than the cooler, while the waitress explained the different cuts all we could smell was rotten meat. We mentioned this to her and she admitted it should be placed in the cooler after being out for a few minutes and swapped with another but the staff doesn't have time for that. GROSS! We ordered oysters (excellent), french onion soup (excellent), crab soup (very bland) gnocchi (small and blah) as appetizers. Our dinner was a NY strip (average) filet(overcharred) short ribs(very fatty) lamb (tiny) with sides of Brussels (over seasoned) Mac n cheese (way to much truffle) chocolate layers (good but nothing special). Now we wait......and wait.....and wait.... For our server to get more water and the bill so we finally ask someone to get her attention. Oh, I forgot that now we learn we have been receiving $9 bottles of water (6 of them) remember we requested tap. So manager comes over and we only complain of the water and over truffled Mac n cheese which he apologizes and removes from the tab. So we go back to waiting.  Now I request another manager of which I explain the entire experience to (I NEVER complain as I understand the demand of the business but for this price and for what the restaurant is I am now disgusted) this manager continues to apologize and explain they appreciate the feedback and he is disappointed that we had a bad experience. He additionally took off the dessert. We were not looking for anything to be comped (just the water). So now we wait again for the tab with empty water glasses, after 5 minutes we ask another server to please bring us water. You would think with that being our biggest complaint you would hydrate your customer. I mean we only wanted FREE WATER! Nothing else free, on a $600 tab. We were all shocked that Gordon Ramsey allows a restaurant to run this way and serve the food they do.  I have since read other reviews and all seem similar to mine. Maybe it is time for Ramsey to read them."

You would expect much more from a place like this. So when you come in, they only give you the drink menu to order, then 15 minutes come to get your drink order. Then 15 minutes later they give you the regular menu. 10 minutes later then come to get your order, and if you don't get an appetizer, the waiter \"frowns\" upon you and would tell you this \"well your entrees are going to take longer to come out because you're not ordering a appetizer\" That doesn't make sense? Because if we order appetizers, wouldn't it take even longer for our entrees to come out? I think he thought we were cheap, and that was not the case. \n\nWe ordered beers, and didn't want appetizers because we didn't want to get full. We didn't even touch the bread. We know with steak places like this, the steak is huge and appetizers would make us even more full. We also order 2 sides (potatoes & mac n cheese) and the waiter was like \"you would usually order 3. We felt like he was trying to up sale on everything and gave us an attitude when we didn't take his recommendations. I felt he thought we were cheap and didn't want to order a lot. FYI, we had a show to attend and couldn't waste our time on food we didn't eat. Ugh, it's service like this! Vegas nobody gives you good service because they will always have people coming, but geez, this guy man... we gave him more than 20% tip too. He doesn't deserve it! \n\nThe steak was good. I shared a porterhouse for 2 with my bf, the filet melted in your mouth. Good filet part. The NY strip part was good, wasn't the best, but it was good. Not the best steakhouse I've been too (probably service turned us off a bit too) Sides were great though, the mac and cheese was sooo good. \n\nWe made reservations a month in advance. We still love Gordon Ramsay. Just be prepare to be judged... but again, \"that's Vegas\" for you."

We got seated at the bottom of the stairs, which was unfortunate since I was hoping we'd be in our own secluded private booth upstairs since we made reservations ahead of time. The upside was that we had a clear view of the kitchen at work and we were close proximity to the bathrooms. \n\nFirst they serve you a trio of bread selections with some house made butter and sea salt. You can't go wrong with any selection, because it's so good. For our appetizers, we decided to go with the Gnocchi and Caesar Salad. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and just melted in your mouth and I loved how it came with the heirloom cherry tomatoes. The Caesar Salad I thought was pretty mediocre and nothing special and it was disappointing that there was only one scotch egg that was split between the two of us. I also did not enjoy that it was huge whole stalks of lettuce rather than already pre-cut. I understand it's fine dining, but since I felt like the time it took you to break the whole salad down to small bite-sized pieces, your steak was already ready to be served.\n\nFor our entrees: I went with the American Kobe Filet and I believe my boyfriend went with the Prime Beef Bone-In Rib Eye. Both were cooked to a perfect medium rare and I remember my steak being super tender and juicy. I can't really speak for the rib eye since I didn't get a chance to taste it.\n\nEven though I was pretty full at this point, I couldn't leave dinner without trying Ramsay's signature dessert, The Sticky Toffee Pudding. I was kinda skeptical about it cause the pictures on Yelp didn't look too appetizing, but I totally changed my mind when it came out. The dessert looked huge, especially when the waiter poured the brown sugar toffee sauce all over the top. And I love how the brown butter ice cream was presented so cleverly--simply looking like a stick of butter! No joke, this dessert made the whole dinner worth it. You gotta try it to see for yourself. The cake is so moist and the toffee isn't overpowering in the sweetness factor. The ice cream is just an added bonus. I can definitely cheers to this satisfying meal!"

Gordon Ramsay steak is one of the newer upscale steakhouses in Vegas and is located conveniently in the center of the strip at the Paris hotel.  I have eaten at some of the other Gordon Ramsay eateries in Vegas and neither of them compare to this one.  In fact, very few steakhouses on the strip compare to this.  The decor, the service, and the food are all fantastic.\n\nWe first started with some drinks, bread (some of the best free bread around) and the seafood platter for 4.  This was one of the best tasting seafood platters I have had.  Everything was fresh and came with a variety of sauces which were amazing.  The crab and lobster was especially tasty. \n\nAfter the starter, I ordered the salmon and the table also shared a porterhouse.  The salmon was very good, and actually a very good portion size.  Normally they make the salmon with a cauliflower puree that when you squeeze lemon over it, it turns purple, but I think they did a seasonal vegetable with it this time (which stayed one color).  The porterhouse was as good as it gets.  Nothing to fancy on the cook, just a very flavorful and moist steak.  Make sure to get a few extra bites off the bone, that's where you get some of the best meat bites.  \n\nThe spinach at GR is also one of the best sides I've ever had.  Just a great blend of garlic and oil to make the spinach super tasty and not too drenched.  \n\nFor desert I tried the peanut butter bar.  Very good, but nothing amazing.\n\nOverall, one of my favorite meals in Vegas."

            "review": "The Atmosphere:  5/5  A cool design with the chunnel bar separating the lounge from the two story dining room.  The open kitchen ads to the energy.  The servers & bar staff are all wearing classy dress shirts with suspenders and ties, (some of the guys could have their shirts tailored though to perfect the look).  The cutlery, plate-ware, linens and glassware were unique and classy. They looked and felt very expensive, these little touches add value for me.\n\nThe Food: 5/5  The shrimp cocktail was good, The Beef Wellington was incredible!  Probably the most flavorful piece of beef I've ever enjoyed. It's one of those types of dishes that many restaurants are scared to serve because it can taste pretty ordinary if it's not prepared correctly.  I won't be ordering it anywhere else because Gordon Ramsey's version has set the bar too high.   Also, get the sticky toffee dessert, our server suggested it and we really enjoyed that too.  I'll get the Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee dessert again but I'll try other apps and sides next time.\n\nThe Drinks:  5/5  Between my wife and I, we ordered the strawberry martini, two Drifters, HK Antioxidant, Pims Cup and a cappuccino with dessert.  We are normally wine drinkers but we saw a lot of value in their cocktails.  The Drifter was my favorite (I love a good whiskey) and my wife enjoyed the HK antioxidant the most.\n\nThe Service: 4/5  We arrived without a reservation and found two seats at the bar.  When we sat down, the bar staffed were getting crushed by the nonstop drink orders and all of the bar guests.  Their cocktails are pretty labor intensive, so they take awhile to make.  Once they caught up, all three of them were very attentive and personable.  We didn't have to wait long for the food at all.  The restaurant just opened three weeks ago and the staff is probably still working out a lot of kinks, hence a few poor yelp reviews about the pace of service.  We had very friendly service at the bar and we'll sit there again.\n\nSummary:  My wife and I own two restaurants and are big fans of eating at chef driven restaurants when we go out.  We've been to Vegas every year for the last five years and Gordon Ramsey's Steak was one of our fondest memories of any of our Las Vegas trips.  Can't wait to go back!"

            "review": "I made Valentines' weekend reservations for Gordon Ramsay's since my wife wanted to dine at a celebrity chef restaurant. We both felt a bit underwhelmed by the steaks however. My wife had the wagyu American eye while I had the beef Wellington. The American eye was pretty good though I couldn't determine whether it was worth paying extra for the higher grade of beef. It was just good steak in my opinion. Short of mind blowing but solid, just not quite worthy of the price tag. I would consider ordering it again though. The beef Wellington on the other hand was supposed to be Ramsay's signature dish so I had high expectations. I found the beef to be somewhat tough and the dish rather bland overall which surprised me. Bummer. We ordered the lobster for appetizer which was quite good though expensive.\n\nThe sides on the other hand were great. We had fingerling potatoes and the mac & cheese. Both had black truffle which added another dimension to the flavor. The sides were huge too! We ended up wasting most of the potatoes because we were completely stuffed.\n\nService was average I would say. The waiter was a little bit brash I guess would be the best way to put it. I won't say rude but definitely not friendly either. He's probably put in some time at Hell's Kitchen ;-)\n\nOverall, I felt a bit less than satisfied with the experience. With so many other restaurants to choose from in Vegas I probably won't return."

We always ordered their dry aged bone-in rib eye and its consistently to die for. Last time i went i ordered their american cap kobe, it was still delicious and fattier, but would pick the rib eye over it if i had to choose. The rib eye center, where the meat is attached to the bone, can slightly lose its saltier flavor and more \"raw\" so asked the server to ask if the cook can cook the center a bit more. And their sticky toffee dessert, always to die for! Their ice cream is so rich and the bread is so moist and fluffy. I wouldnt mind an extra stick of ice cream with it. So dont forget to save stomach space for this. We dont usually get to finish the steaks so we pack it up try to eat when home and boy does it still taste bomb.\n\nService is always pleasant and very accomodating and professional. Aside from dinner, its also nice to just chill at their bar for some cocktails while nibbling the sticky toffee dessert."

Was he a good waiter?  Well he was perfectly fine, he was there when we needed him for ordering, he explained the steaks somewhat (although on autopilot), the water and wine got refilled appropriately, but neither he (nor anyone) once dropped by to ask how the food was or if we needed anything.\n\nIs he told to upsell by you Gordon?  Or by the General Manager?  Or he just wants to inflate the price for a bigger tip?  Whatever the reason or whoever told him to do it, DON'T.  The meal cost us almost $300 as it was, I shouldn't have to feel that I was a skinflint who should have dropped a couple more C-Notes. \n\nOn the other hand, the assistant waiter was super friendly, helpful, all around excellent.  The hostess was great.  The Sommelier was super enthusiastic (he chatted to us for a long time about Napa wineries).\n\nOK, onto the food:\nMy g/f got the Hamachi Cruda, mega pricey at $22, but she liked it.\n\nI got the onion soup.  It was a very good onion soup, but it was lukewarm and could have been filled a lot higher and priced a lot lower.  I couldn't ask you to heat it up because nobody came by to ask how it was. \n\nThe bread was pretty good.  The bacon one was extremely yummy, no complaints there.\n\nMy g/f got the Beef Wellington, and I got the braised short ribs, and we got a side of Brussel Sprouts.  The sprouts were deeee-lish, as were the short ribs.  I had been dreaming for days of the Wellington after reading all the stellar reviews.  I should point out that filet is not really my thing, I'm a bone-in ribeye kind of guy, but given that caveat, I still expected to be bowled over.  I wasn't.  The meat was top quality and cooked a perfect medium rare, but the pastry was sort of hard (flaky on top, but the inner layer tasted like it was either undercooked, or maybe overcooked), and the mushroom coating was nowhere to be found (well we did find a lump of mushroomy stuff stuck in one corner of the pastry).  So, as a filet it was perfectly fine but not extraordinary, as a Wellington it wasn't the euphoric moment that other Yelpers describe.  Maybe it was just us (my g/f felt exactly the same way and she always orders filet), or maybe our Wellington wasn't quite right.  The mash and veggie sides on both dishes were excellent.\n\nDessert: OMFG, the sticky toffee pudding and that stick of faux butter was heaven on a plate.  If you opened a sticky toffee pudding restaurant I'd be there every night.  The French Press coffee was also good, especially with the yummy chocolate.\n\nSo, we were expecting the greatest meal of our lives, and what we got was a very good meal in a very good restaurant.  A flawed restaurant that could be a lot better if you'd just remember that tourists are people too."

His take on simple dishes is amazing.\n\nFantastics: food, drinks, decor, ambiance, accoutrements to all dishes.\n\nQuestionables: service was attentive but slow; we had a reservation but had to wait a minimum of 30 minutes for our table and others waited longer; prices - this is the most expensive meal we've eaten in the States.\n\nQuirks: When you are shown to your table, the hostess pauses in your journey to point out different elements of the decor. The uniforms of each type of staff are quite unique and cool. The main entry way was fashioned to look like the Chunnel.\n\nThe Food\n\nThe complimentary bread was out of this world. It was served with butter sprinkled with volcanic salt.\n\nWe also ordered the French onion soup. Although it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was very flavorful and tasted strongly of vidalia onions.\n\nThe fish and chips here are the best I've ever had. Although you'll fork over almost $50, it's a lovely new take on this old British fare. Highly recommended.\n\nWe also got the fisherman's grill. Although there was nothing bad in particular about this dish, it was unimaginative and bland. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nWe got the strawberries & basil dessert. I wouldn't order this again. The basil ice cream was to die for, but the semolina cake was dry and kinda gross. The dish could be greatly improved without it.\n\nMAKE A RESERVATION."

My friend said the fixture of red lines attached to the ceiling was representative of ways to slice beef - awesome.\n\nService was excellent. Each course was served at the same time to each person, my water glass was never empty (I take my water like fish) and our server was receptive to splitting the check.\n\nNow the food. I always appreciate when a restaurant does their bread well and this restaurant's was on point. For appetizers, my friends had foie gras, pork belly & oysters - all of which were enjoyed. I ordered the Market Green Salad with dressing on the side. The toppings (pancetta, blue cheese & tomato raisins) were fantastic but I can't say I loved the salad as a whole. Perhaps if I let them douse it in the heavy cream dressing, I would have enjoyed it more, but I also wanted something light to balance the steak later.\n\nThe server recommended the rib cap and 4 of us took him up on it. I don't usually like marbling but it was done incredibly here. My steak was sweet, juicy and tender. Sides ordered included the pur\u00e9ed potatoes (nothing special) and truffle mac & cheese (lots of truffle).\n\nTo summarize, I'd come back for the rib cap or to try the Wellington (my friends loved it) and any appetizers that aren't salads, but I won't be ordering any sides next time."

I enjoyed the meat cart, but it makes it hard for indecisive people like myself. We got the porterhouse for 2 and it was perfect. It was precut and that would bother some people, but not me. Someone in our party got beef Wellington, it was good but I enjoy the steak. Loaded baked potato, Mac and cheese, and creamed spinach. The sides were excellent. For dessert was Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla bean ice cream that looks like butter. Great presentation with the knife through the \"butter.\" Service was on point.

Both of these men have great personalities and great attitudes besides a great work ethic! Mohamadu said he remembered me but it has been two years and many people in between.

The first time I have had an app like this and I was not dissapointed!\n\nAll three appetizers were shared and a great start to our meal.\n\nEntrees,\n \nPat LaFrieda 28+ day dry aged Bone in rib eye. Enough said!  Perfect medium for my guest. (I prefer MR for me)\n\nAmerican rib cap. I butchers little secret here! It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was so very flavorful and tender. I suggest this to anyone looking for a flavorful tender steak that you can actually finish.\n\n(Should I mention I am a meat cutter of over 30 years and know good meat? Pat LaFrieda has some of the best!)\n\nRoasted chicken breast with multigrain pilaf, crispy skin dumplings,\nlimoncello jus. This was a very tasty dish but the one thing that could be done better is to get the crispy skin more crispy! It was a little underdone and a bit chewy for my liking.\n\nOver all our meal was wonderful. Our service was on point and was very much appreciated. Richard and Mohamdu have a way of taking care of the tables to perfection and not really bothering you while doing so. I like service but dont like it over done. Let me dine and enjoy my meal and this team did just that.\n\nSpecial thank you to Anthony for reaching out. You sir is why I came back for another try!

As we didn't make a reservation we were offered to sit in the bar or 5 tables that were available for guests without reservation, but there was none when we arrived. We waited about 15 minutes o get a table, meanwhile we ordered our drinks from the iPad application. The only problem was that the alarm next to us just went off and ringed for more than 5 minutes. We asked the reason for this and the waitress said it happens all the time, very disturbing!\nAfter having a look at the menu, I asked the waitress for a recommendation. BTW, the staff was always smiling and very helpful, great service. We got the bread selection plate and everything that came to the table was described in detail. The waitress started describing the American Kobe Rib Cab and that was it, I did't ask for any other option. Me and my friends ordered a medium one, but we believe it was a little more than medium. We ordered also asparagus and potatoes as siders. Asparagus was good, the potatoes were great! The steak was wonderful, the best I ever had. I also tried the Bone-in Prime Ribeye at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse and the Tomahawk Steak at Joe Vicari's Andimo Italian Steakhouse, Gordon Ramsey was far way the best, no discussion, and my friends also agree with that. All the steaks were in the same price range. One mistake we made was to go to Gordon Ramsey first, the other steaks were just ordinary afterwards.\nI had a glass of red wine with my steak, my friends opted for a beer, the wine was great, but I think it is a little overpriced. So I ended up with a 103 $ bill, my friends paid 94 $, and of course we also tipped. Everything was just excellent, except for that alarm."

When he came back up my husband went down and saw that they blocked the restroom. So he asked someone who works there if he can use the restroom, they said 'no because someone from your party threw up infront of the restroom and got escorted out and will no longer be able come back in for the night'\nSo my husband freaks out and came storming upstairs to see who it was. \nWhen he saw every single one of us sitting down having a good time, he thought that was really strange.\n\nNow here comes the fun part.\n\nThe bill came out and we noticed that we were charged for WATER.\n $9 PER glass!!\nSo it was $90 just for water for all ten of us.\nWe asked our waiter why and he said  (pointing finger at my cousin) that gentlemen ordered distilled water. \nWTF!?!?\nMy cousin ordered two bottles of wine not water. I know thats for a fact cuz I was sitting right next to him. And also, why in the world would we order distilled water when we can be sipping on cocktails that are only $14. Heck no!\nSo the waiter comes back after talking to the manager and says he can take HALF of the water off from our bill but not all of it.\nSo we tell him \nlisten, we ordered everything on this table except for the water. We would not have a problem paying for a water if we ordered it why would we lie? \nI mean, our bill already came out to about $1400 anyway so dont mind paying another $100 for water ONLY if we ordered it!\nWhen the waiter kept insisting my cousin ordered the distilled water my husband finally tells him to go get the manager.\nIn these exact words \"bro just go get the manager'\nAnd the waiter replys back\n\"I will if you be nice\"\nOMFG.. We could not believe our ears..\nAfter a while the manager comes and asked what the problem was.\nWe told him the situation and he says two of his waiters heard us ordering 'distilled water'.\nWe tell him no. If the restaurant requires costumers to pay for water, we do not have a problem paying.\nApparently, the waiter OR this restaurant tricks customers to pay for what we didnt even order.\nEither that waiter lied so he get get more $$ since they add the 18% gratitude. Or this restaurant does not give a shit thinking we're all tourist cuz even the manager had the same rude attitude as the waiter.\nWe told the manager his waiter told us to be nice and he says that he was told that we cussed at him.\nThats when my husband told the manager he was recording this whole conversation (which he really was) and asks ' Do you want to hear it?!' \nHis face turns white and asks what we wanted him to do. \nThen he asks if we wanted the water to be taken off the bill.\nWe said yes please and the manager without saying sorry or okay or whatever,\nhe just storms off.\nThese people here are racists.\nWe were all Asains and apparently they were thinking we were some cheap Asian tourists, who they can rip off and don't give a shit about it.\nThey dont deserve any customers AT ALL.\nManagement sucks.\nBEWARE because they are ready to rip you off"

For the main course we each got steaks and mine was the Kobe skirt steak. This steak was pure perfection. They don't even offer regular steak knives (at least not unless requesting one) at this establishment because all you need is a butter knife. The service was amazing and we never had to wait long to have our drinks replenished. I had some type of antioxidant cocktail and it was something very smooth that was sweet but not too sweet and I could have drank all night long. We will definitely be going here again the next time we are in Vegas!"

            "review": "My first time dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak in 2012 was magical! I was lucky to come when a recent Hell Kitchen chef worked there during their starting months. At that time, Gordon Ramsay Steak was so hard to get reservations. 3 years later, the food here remains its high quality. However, it lacks a little magical touch that I firstly got during my very first visit to the restaurant. Regardless, this restaurant is my togo fine dining location every time I go to Vegas. If you are looking for the Gordon Ramsay's blowing-your-mind-kind-of food, this destination is a must comparing to his other restaurants in Vegas. \n\nLocation (5/5): Gordon Ramsay Steak locates inside the Eiffel Tower Building on the Las Vegas Strip. The entrance to the restaurant is modern leading you to a London hip atmosphere with contemporary interior decors. If you are dining in a group of 4, you are more likely to be seat at their first floor. If you reserve for a party of 6 and more, you will be seated at the private dining room on the second floor. \n\nService (4/5): Services here is great before coming to the restaurant and during my dining experience. If you come here for a special occasion, let them know! I'm sure they can add little touches here and there to \"fantisize\" your dining experience. All waiters are professional and knowledgable about the food. Depending on your eating pace, orders can take a slightly long time if your party consists of fast eaters. \n\nFood (5/5): I had the opportunities to try both regular menus and the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu. If you are a TR member, you will pay less for regular menu food. Regardless which route you go, they will give you complimentary assorted bread to snack before your meal. \n\n* Regular menu: I love their Butter Poached Maine Lobster ($28) and Smoked Beef Tartare ($22). If you are a MasterChef fan, you would probably remember the episode where Masterchef Lucas had to poach lobster inside butter. YES! That's what you are getting here... but better! The lobster meat was sooooo buttery and light and slowly melted in your month. The fact that the lobster's portion is small made my palette craving for more EVERYTIME! The smoke beef tartare, on the other hand, was just awesome! The way it was brought out to the table was smoky and full with mystery. You know that you order something cool when people at nearby tables stop eating and stare at your food! YESH! The potato chips served on the transparent acrylic holder was so beautiful that I didn't want to eat it. For the main course, I usually go for the most famous Ramsay's signature dish, the Roast Beef Wellington ($57). My boyfriend would go for the 16oz Bone-in Rib Eye. Both are huge portions! \n\n* Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu: The way the tasting menu works is that everyone in your party has to join in the tasting menu. It costs $145/person and an additional of $75 per person if you want wine pairing. At the beginning of the meal, everyone at the table will be given a copy of the official Hell Kitchen's Tasting Menu signed by Gordon Ramsay himself. According to the restaurant, there are only 2000 official copies of this menu. So here is the list of 5 courses along with the wine pairings:\n\n1) Amuse Bouche - Scotch Egg\nBerkshire pork sausage, red wine braised cabbage\nPairing - Louis de Sacy, Champagne, Grand Cru, MV\n\n2) First Course - Potato and Octopus Salad\nCharred octopus, mustard vinaigrette, remoulade, pumpernickel soil, marbled fingerling potatoes\nPairing - North Coast Brewing, Pranqster,Belgian Style Golden Ale, California \n\n3) Second Course - Butternut Squash Risotto\nSeared scallop, sage, mascarpone \nPairing - Emeritus, Pinot Noir, Hallberg Ranch, Russian River Valley, 2011\n\n4) Third Course - Roasted Beef Wellington\nGlazed root vegetables, potato puree, red wine demi-glace\nPairing - Fleur de Bouard, Bordeaux, Le Plus, Lalande de Pomerol \n\n5) Dessert Course - Sticky Toffee Pudding\nSweet date pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream\nPairing - Chambers Rosewood, Muscat, Rutherglen, MV\n\nI personally LOVE their creamy risotto! It was so flavorful and smooth that just went straight down to my throat leaving a tasty warmth at the back of my tongue. Of course, the beef welling must be included in their tasting menu! For the first time, I witnessed my mom eating a medium-rate piece of meat and she loved it! What must be emphasized in this tasting menu is their Sticky Toffee Pudding! For a person who hates chocolate and cake like my dad to happily enjoy this dessert should tell you something! As you can tell, their tasting menu converted both of my parents and opened their palettes to new flavors! \n\nPersonally, I would definitely come back simply because their food changed my parents' perspectives about what steakhouses are nowadays. I would also come back and bring friends here if they are interested in trying Ramsay's bold flavors for the first time."

            "review": "I think I just had the best steak dinner of my life.  Everything about our dinner was just impeccable!\n\nFirst of all our server, Anthony, was AWESOME.  He was friendly and energetic but definitely not aggressive or over the top.  He was fantastic about explaining everything on the menu and answering our questions, and he was excellent about making suggestions, especially when we were on the fence about some things.\n\nWe started out with Ty Nant sparkling spring water which was very good!  JAS likes beer with his steak, so he ordered the Moose Drool Brown Ale and thought it was great.  I asked if they had pineapple juice, which they did, but even better was that it was freshly squeezed!  Delicious.\n\nJAS and I had reviewed the menu online earlier in the day and decided that we were going to get the Roasted Beef Wellington for two.  We had watched enough Hell's Kitchen to make us want to try this famous dish.  We had mentioned this to Anthony prior to him bringing over the steak display which, by the way, was pretty impressive:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=BVZECZd6-u3Zw45DfVKEtw#BVZECZd6-u3Zw45DfVKEtw\n\nAnthony said he would still go over the steaks with us, and we were glad he did.  JAS loves ribeyes, and when Anthony described the rib cap to us, he threw a wrench in our plans.  Ohhhh, what should we do?  He then said that he could have the kitchen split the orders into two plates if we wanted so we could try both.  What a fantastic idea!  So out went the Beef Wellington for two, in came the Beef Wellington for one AND the Kobe American Rib Cap.\n\nI wish I had a better memory because they served different kinds of bread with butter (did I hear Devonshire?) and volcanic sea salt.  Yummy.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=_UfQDFOJOaDyfUWiMOq08g#_UfQDFOJOaDyfUWiMOq08g\n\nWe started with the Heirloom Tomato Salad with red bell pepper vinaigrette, cucumber cauliflower puree, spiced marcona almonds.  They split it into two plates for us.  So fresh, so delicious.  I wanted to lick everything off that plate.  (I didn't!)  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=DhEwPJGDDfUy6huMrmYOLA#DhEwPJGDDfUy6huMrmYOLA\n\nThe Roasted Beef Wellington was served with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, and red wine demi glace.  This was no ordinary Beef Wellington.  Anthony had described what the steak was wrapped in but there were so many components that I can't remember it all!   It was split into two plates and it tasted wonderful!  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=3IqEuRS3GnDTuzecN8a0Ig#3IqEuRS3GnDTuzecN8a0Ig\n\nThe Kobe American Rib Cap was the most delicious steak I've ever eaten.  It is very flavorful and very tender.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=I97LcskpiJdDNT099LXU6A#I97LcskpiJdDNT099LXU6A\n\nWe ordered the Haricot Vert  (tempura fried, confit, with garlic citrus aioli) for our side.  A Yelper recommended this, so I wanted it.  It was good!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=EVS8qtI30r33YQANLarHTA#EVS8qtI30r33YQANLarHTA\n\nFor dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream).  It is rich, it is sweet, it is remarkable.  I loved how the brown butter ice cream looked just like a stick of butter.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=uAXd7oN-Si5Ee_2P_YjgAA#uAXd7oN-Si5Ee_2P_YjgAA\n\nOur dinner was relaxing and more than pleasant.  Not once did we feel pressured to order one way or another.  Each member of the staff we interacted with was professional and genuinely friendly.  They made us feel welcome when we arrived and thanked us for visiting when we left.  Everything about our dinner experience was perfect.  \n\nWe have already decided that this will be a definite stop during our next visit to Vegas!"

Despite its subtle exterior the inside of the restaurant is rather extravagant.  In the center of the ceiling is a red \"birds nest\" of lights that represent Ramsay's hand motions while cooking and the overall ambience is a low roar of light rock music and the shouts of diners.  As for the food, the Beef Wellington is simply amazing.  A taste that was complex, yet very subtle and well rounded.  The Fioe Gras appetizer melts in your mouth and explodes with flavor.  The sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream is a genius creation and an interesting play on a classic dish.  And as with all his restaurants in Las Vegas, 'Innis and Gunn' is on tap and is a must try for beer lovers."

This place was a splurge for us but absolutely worth every penny. \n\nBetween the 5 of us, we each ordered something different and enjoyed sampling each other's dishes. \n\nService was absolutely amazing. Our waitress was Olga who was very knowledgeable and kind, she referred us to a sommelier who made an excellent recommendation that I enjoyed very much to accompany my beef Wellington. Our absolutely favorite was Noel, who must have been psychic when it came to needing a refresher with our water. He was an absolute pleasure to interact with. \n\nPlease be aware that they do charge for water here. It is much more palatable than the swill they call tap water in Vegas; but it is absolutely worth mentioning that it will cost you. Not to sound like a backwoods hermit, but I have never paid for water at a restaurant before despite having visited several high profile chef's restaurants during my travels. \n\nI ordered the beef Wellington and am so beyond satisfied with my choice. The fingerling potatoes and the blue cheese Mac and cheese was a wonderful side. I had absolutely no room left but I wanted to try the sticky toffee pudding and I am not regretful in the slightest. I tried to cut the heavy meal with the French roast coffee, which was so delicious I could easily drink it without cream (but did opt to stir in the Baileys spoon that accompanied it!). \n\nI don't have enough wonderful things to say about my experience here. Well done, Steak! Bravo!"

I probably made the reservation specialist a little crazy however, she was very accommodating.  My three buddies and I arrived at the reservation time and were warmly greeted.  The staff requested we go into the lounge for a couple of minutes (we were early by a couple of minutes) to start our experience.  The wait did not even take that long.  We were quickly shown to our booth and as our server Chris was getting ready to wheel the display of steak offerings decided to actually show them to us after asking and we agree.  The display was phenomenal and Chris expertly advised what was on the display.  I personally decided to go with the Beef Wellington which is a Gordon Ramsay signature dish.  Chris advised it only comes one way which was I believe medium rare is what he said.  Not remembering if I have ever had Beef Wellington, I was very pleased with presentation and taste of the Wellington.  It was perfectly prepared, lots of good flavor and the accompaniments to the entree were tasty as well.  I also had the side of pan seared foie gras was beyond belief at how amazing it tasted.  I was definitely in heaven with my meal.  My friends that I was with were equally satisfied with their meals and the wine suggestion of the sommelier in regards to a nice red blend was pretty awesome as well.  I have done a disservice by not mentioning it earlier however, the bread selections in place of dinner rolls were just the right petite size with a ton of flavor.  The one selection I tasted was either with pancetta or prosciutto and was just amazing.  The only thing that would have completed the experience would have been meeting Christina Wilson who I actually saw however, Gordon Ramsay has found a gem for his restaurant as she was discussing something with another member of the staff and quickly disappeared again.  The sommelier advised that Gordon Ramsay was at the restaurant however, was in meetings with some of his staff and when the sommelier went to let Chef know that a huge fan was hoping to possibly meet him, Chef was already gone once again.  No matter what, I would most definitely have dinner at this restaurant once again.  Thank you Chris our server, the restaurant sommelier and the entire staff for an amazing experience and a fantastic meal."

The place has a great look to it and surprisingly not very loud (except for the alarm that went off during dinner).  The service was A+.  Our waiter and his asst. were on top of clearing plates and refilling drinks.  At the beginning of the meal, we were asked if we wanted to take part in a special \"Hell's Kitchen\" course, it was $145 per person and everyone at the table had to order it.  But here's where I think even for a upscale establishment, it just made me laugh.   If you ordered the special \"Hell's Kitchen\" thing, you were to be given a shitty out of focus black and white autographed photo of Chef Gordon Ramsay himself.   You'd think you'd get at least a color in focus image of him.   It was super funny.  I ordered the American Kobe Red Cap which was very tasty as well as the  Potato Puree (yukon gold potato, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche), which have to be in the tops for potato side dishes.   The only thing that wasn't as good was the Bourbon Creamed Corn with red onion marmalade.  Some things don't need to be included, I'm talking to you red onion marmalade.   Having said that, it was worth the cost which was very very reasonable, I guessed our check and it was at least $100 less.  So there.  Worth a visit."

Made us feel very welcome, offered excellent suggestions, was there when we needed him and just an overall, friendly, likable guy. I think maybe because we were put in an upstairs room, away from all the action of the main restaurant, in kind of an odd table, maybe that's what it was? Or maybe because I was not \"blown away\" by my steak. Here's what we had and my take on it:\n\nCrab soup: Delicious. Not a heavy, cream base, it was a bit like a bisque, had excellent flavor, plenty of crab.\n\nCarpaccio appetizer: I enjoyed it, but it was not the best. I would probably skip and try something different.\n\nRib cap: it was suggested by Ted since we were leaning towards the bone-in ribeye. So glad we tried it, best cut of meat. Very tender with a really nice flavor, I would definitely order it.\n\nPrime New York Strip: it was just ok. They did cook it a perfect medium rare, so no complaints there, but definitely was not as tender or flavorful as the rib cap. For what I paid, I would have expected way better. I added the butter poached lobster tail to it, it was standard. And small :/\n\nSides: Baked potato: wow, just a darn good baker, and plenty for two people. \nMac and cheese: yeah, I know, we went on starch overload here, so probably should have tried the Brussels sprouts or I thought the okra looked interesting. It was a little heavy on the truffle oil. It was definitely good, but I've actually had better at other places. \n\nDessert: Um, I have to jump on the bandwagon here...sticky toffee pudding...DONE! you will never have anything else like it. I'm pretty sure I've since had dreams about it. \n\nNice touches: the French pressed coffee and the presentation it comes with, Amaretto, Bailey's and Chambord frozen spoons if you are into that. I just like mine plain with cream, it was excellent.\n\nWe had a great time, thanks to the awesome Ted, as well as the other people who served us that evening. I don't think the restaurant is pretentious or snooty, we did not encounter any of that. But, would I ever go back for dinner, probably not. I could get equally good steaks in my opinion over at Mastros in Crystals. However, would I come in for a night cap of sticky toffee pudding and coffee, absolutely."

Staff were very nice from the hostess up to the waiter its A+. Very knowledgable and explained every dish they served. \n\nBread and Butter\n-- they gave us a variety of breads. Its not your typical french bread. Loved the cheesy bread, and the roll with pancetta. It comes with butter topped with sea salt (from hawaii) which is quite good.\n\n We had pimms cup (sparkling lemonade) for our cocktail, and it was very good. Very refreshing for a hot Vegas weather. It comes with a slice of cucumber, apple, orange and a couple of blueberries. Perfect cocktail for non-alcoholic drinker.\n\nSalads\n-- i got the ceasars salad with scotch egg. It was good but i forgot to mention to go light on the dressing since i dont really like too much on my salad. Wished they put more eggs (quail egg) and not just a tiny piece on the plate. Loved the garlic croutons but the dressing is just overpowering for me.\n\nAhi Tuna\n-- my Mom loved it. I tasted a little bit of it. The tuna was perfectly seared. Very light dressing. I loved it.\n\nWe did not order any other appetizers since we want to enjoy our entree right away. \n\n32oz bone-in rib-eye\n--- Hah!!! Very good. Very tasty. Very big! It was my mom's order but i ended up eating some of it. I prefer my steak medium and my mom liked it medium rare. I did enjoy the part that was seared but the rest of it was pretty raw for me. It has more fat than i expected. \nBeef Wellington\n-- ordered this one to get the taste of his signature dish. It was ok for me. The beef was perfectly cooked, and tender. the pastry was very flaky. It comes with potato puree and some root veggies. I think the red wine sauce was over reduced because some solidified on my plate. It was ok but i will probably order another dish next time. \n\nWe wanted to have dessert but we are so full. Overall it was a great experience. Thanks for my fellow yelpers advising to order just the tap water than thr still water. It saved me $9. And also you may want to get a Total Rewards Card from them since they give you a much lower price if you have it."

Moist and juicy inside and slightly chard on the outside. Just the way I like it. The meat just melts in your mouth.  \nWe paired the rib eye  with the lobster tail, roasted carrots and spinach. I wouldn't recommend  the lobster and spinach, nothing special.  \nI definitely come back on my next visit for more steak."

Then it proceeded to an octopus salad, which was hopefully over cooked as opposed to stale, it was chewy and rubbery. When we pointed it out to our waiter, he did nothing about it... The Wellington was good and the desert was good, it was Ramsay's signature sticky toffee pudding... \n\nOverall the food was underwhelming, over-priced, the sommelier was disinterested and unengaging, and the wine pairing mismatched and cheap, the service was decent but the waiters weren't invested or caring about the quality of the food... At the end of the meal you get a signed Gordon Ramsay menu, which is a cool novelty! Almost $600 later and that's really all you're left with. I don't usually write reviews, good or bad, in this case both my wife and I had really enjoyed Ramsay's tasting menu at the London, NYC - so we had high expectations! We were thoroughly disappointed! \n\nStay away from the HK tasting menu, not worth it!"

The Pub&Grill is chill and cozy with its big seats and great eats. \n\nSteak, though? The atmosphere, as one of my dining companions whispered, \"felt like I was on a date in American Psycho in 1989.\" And that's about right. While the waitstaff are easy to look at, the decor is not ultra high-end, nor is it especially warm or comforting. It aims for a lounge atmosphere, but the type of lounge for those who don't like to lounge. It doesn't scream STEAK. Its scream is just muffled, like into a designer pillow. \n\nAnyway, the food. We went for drinks and dessert and had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, the Pear Tart Tatin, and a black coffee. 3-stars because the presentation was superb. I love it when waitstaff finish plating a dish at the table. \"Here is the Thing, and now I finish decorating it with a Drizzle of Sauce or Other while telling you all about the Thing.\" Fine food presented as an art. This is the experience one seeks when fine dining outside of the home. Whisper to me these sweet nothings about what I'm to enjoy.\n\nSo why the mere 3-stars? $7 for a cup of coffee. Let's be real. Not even Starbucks charges this much. No cup is worth that amount. I understand charging what they do for the featured entrees, but $7 for a cup of coffee is ludicrous. Next, the cinnamon used in the house-made ice cream atop the Pear Tatin was quite strong, or as another companion bluntly stated, \"like a melted stick of Big Red gum.\" \n\nWhen I inquired as to what type of cinnamon was used in the ice cream, I'm not sure what was more disappointing: being told it was just standard cinnamon, or that the chef in back had been surprised and found the question laughable. \"They're asking about the cinnamon?\" Yes, because it's very present in my mouth, so I want to know about it. \n\nI'm sorry, is this not a Gordon Ramsay restaurant? Is it silly for guests to expect, at these prices, for cinnamon ice cream to be made with higher quality ingredients, like Vietnamese, and for the question to not be laughed at? The use of a generic spice would explain its Big Red taste, but rather appalling for the Gordon Ramsay reputation I otherwise adore. How unfortunate. \n\nDat luscious brown-sugar glazed toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream doh?  A+. But, my confidence is shaken, so I'd not risk coming here for some high-dollar steak or other plate. No doubt you can find better executions of the same off-Strip, minus the celebrity chef thrill."

I heard the Roasted Beef Wellington is good here so I ordered one and my friend wanted one as well.  I checked the menu on the website before coming in and it said that this dish takes 45 minutes to prepare and they were not kidding.  In fact, it took around an hour for it to come out.  However, it was well worth it.  The beef was cooked medium rare and covered by a thin layer of puff pastry.  Every bite of the beef was soft and juicy.  We also ordered the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras and it was probably the best foie gras I ever had.  The portion we got was generous and fatty and very rich in flavor."

I couldn't hear what the hostess said about orders .. so we waited for someone to come over and take our drink orders.. but no one ever came. (maybe she said to order at the bar?)\n\na different hostess came into the bar / waiting area and said our table was ready.\n\nas we walked from the bar area to the dining area she said something about a cable car or train car? couldn't hear her over the music.   \n\nas we entered the dining area she told us about the cool neon artwork above us.. again I couldn't hear her. my wife who was next to the hostess had to repeat to all of us after we sat down what she said. (the lights are supposedly the hand movements of Gordon when he makes a wellington)\n\nI was holding my daughter and I sat down. I was given a menu, then despite the fact that I had both hands full I was given the wine menu , which I had to set down immediately.  \n\nthey gave my wife a tablet that had the drink menu on it. (tablet had to reboot before we could use it - no bigie)\n\neverything on the menu sounded great lots of amazing options .   although I quickly zeroed in on all the steak choices .  after just a short bit a staff member came over with a steak cart. it has examples of all the amazing beef cuts.  there is prime, dry aged prime, and real wygu beef.  I really wanted to hear everything about the steaks ... but (bet you can guess) I could not hear him over the music .    \n\nthe wait staff was very attentive and we had no problems ordering a dirty vodka marinti and a whisky sour..  both were very tasty, couldn't taste the alcohol..  I'm assuming its because they were mixed so well , and they were on the big side .  \n\nso the food we told the staff the Mac and cheese was for our daughter and please bring it out first.  they brought it out very quickly! the Mac and cheese was amazing, best I've ever had. my daughter loved it and we were all eating out of her bowl.    she also liked their yummy breads.  when we needed milk for her again it was easy to get tell a wait staff member who very quickly brought the milk.\n\nmy wife had a seafood plate with various fish and shell fish. she loved it all. my mother in law got the sea bass and also loved it. \n\nmy brother in law and I both had the bone in rib eye, medium rare.   the cook was dead one with a nice red and warm (not hot) center.  seemed seasoned well,\n\ncrazy thing. the steak was tough and chewy.  ? it was juicy and had good flavor, but it was tough and almost had some grizzle on it.. ? very disappointing.   I wonder if they got a bad batch or just a few steaks were tough? felt more like a roast than a steak in terms of tough/chewiness \n\nmy mother in law loved everything she eat, but said she wouldn't want to eat there again because of the loud music.  (house and top 40)  I actually really liked the music that was being played.. just not the volume.  \n\nI did mention that my steak was tough and they offered to refire and even change to a different cut.  which normally I would do, but there's only so long a toddler will behave NAD I didn't want to push our luck.   not to mention due to not being able to hear the wait staff my dining experience was already ruined. \n\n355$ for 4 and a toddler.   I spent 280 for 2 at the mix a year ago so its actually a good value.  but I had a much better experience last year.  \n\n=/\n\nwe have reservations for the Ramsay grill and pub so hopefully that will be a better experience.\n\n** update**  I canceled my reservations for his pub and grill  due to my bad experience at his steak house and went to Bachi burger instead."

In the end my husband was very satisfied with what he ended up choosing. \n\nWe were very surprised by the meat cart! It was fun, though.\n\nI ordered the American Kobe skirt steak, which I requested rare plus - and it was cooked to absolute perfection. It was seasoned perfectly, and I ate every bite of it. One of the the best steaks I have ever had. My husband ordered the bone-in New York strip, and he loved it. The bite I had was phenomenal.\n\nOur waiter was great, our food was great, and the atmosphere was great. We were well taken care of.

We went to Vegas for 4 nights and could not get a reservation.  However, all was not lost.  They have a bar area with about 8 tables where it is first come first served and they serve the entire menu.  We decided to go early and walked right in to a nice table.  \n\nThe service is 5 star. Our server's name was Olga and we immediately put her to the test.  We are a very flirtatious and outgoing group.  She stood up to the test and then some.  The restaurant manager, Jean Phillipe, was supportive, gratuitous, informative and treated us like we were celebrities.\n\nNow, for our meal.  They have so many delicious looking choices.  We decided to order a variety of appetizers so that we could try them.  The seafood tower was delicious and perfectly done right.  My wife wanted to take home the octopus base - very nice piece of art.  We also had the pork belly and fois gras. Both were incredibly delis ions and cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nThere were 4 of us.  Two had to have, of course, the signature Beef Wellington.  It was not my order but I tasted it and it was perfection.  I had the American Kobe Ribeye topped with pan seared fois gras.  I can still taste it now, 3 days later.  It was a steak that I will never forget.\n\nFinally, for dessert, Jean Pierre asked us to allow him to select the desserts.  They have an award winning dessert chef.  He selected 3 desserts.  I want to kick myself for to remembering the names but they were all off the charts delicious!  JeanPierre even went so far as to tell us which order to eat them.   The one that I enjoyed the most was the last dessert of toffee bread pudding.....very sexy dessert.  The other two involved a peanut butter s'mores cheesecake and a puff pastry with pears....yummie!!!\n\nWe took pictures with everyone although Ramsey was not in attendance that night.  Everyone was happy to make our experience one to remember.  I will definitely go back multiple times.\n\nOh, and by the way, they have a very nice wine list.  Unfortunately, my crew did to have any red drinkers so I settled on a couple of glasses of Faust Cabernet as recommended by Olga. Very nice."

We were then greeted by our waiter Matthew who showed us the ropes and was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. Also serving us was a very nice man named Mohamadu who did not skip a beat when it came to refilling glasses and removing finished dishes; both he and Matthew had a great sense of humor and really made our party feel welcome and relaxed.\n\nTo aid us in our drink selection the restaurant uses an Ipad with an interactive drink menu which really came in handy, giving us all a look at what each cocktail would look like when served. I was surprised with the ease of use of the device and everyone played with it a bit before ordering. We ordered a nice cabernet sauvignon, with the aid of the delightfully helpful and knowledgeable sommelier, and the HK antioxidant cocktail-- both were fantastic. Then, to aid us in our choice of steak (for those who wanted steak), the staff brought out a wonderful arrangement of cuts and Matthew gave us a quick but detailed description of each. This was fantastic, being able to see each cut and knowing exactly what you were going to get as you ordered!\n\nAfter placing our orders, a delicious assortment of specialty breads was served. Mohamadu noticed that we had all sampled the same kind of bread, and without a moments noticed had returned with an extra plate of just those breads; we all very much appreciated his keen attention to detail as we devoured them.\n\nThe food arrived hot and prepared as ordered... to perfection. Every dish our group of 5 enjoyed was delectable and exceeded all expectations. Each of us ordered something different, so we sampled a good portion of the menu to include several different entrees, sides, and soup/salads. Especially delicious was the beef wellington, which is one of the steakhouse's specialties. Also I would like to point out how great the \"mac'n'cheese\" was - I would have never though macaroni could taste this good! After dinner we enjoyed a few of the desserts offered to include the cheese platter, and again we were not disappointed.\n\nAs we all walked out, Matthew and Mohamadu shook our hands and thanked us as we passed by. We have all dined at several other high-end restaurants in Las Vegas and never once had service like this. Many other dining spots in the area have exceptional food, but none have the atmosphere and care; you feel like a guest in someone's home.\n\nSo to sum it all up, my party and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, service, food and drinks ordered. Each dish was cooked to order and all were seasoned deliciously. The service was second to none, and if you want a sure bet for wonderful service I would definitely recommend asking for Matthew and Mohamadu by name... they won't disappoint!"

They provide an i-Pad for you upon seating to review the beverage selections, which I appreciated, but my 69 year old father found to be confusing.  Definitely marketing towards the younger, hipper crowd.\n\nThey provide 4 different types of bread to sample, which was nice -- my favorite may have been the walnut bread.  Sides are generous portions served family-style.  We tried the potato puree, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and a loaded baked potato for a party of three.  I loved the brussel sprouts, but I'm a huge fan.  The potato puree could have been richer with more cream and/or butter and seasoned a bit more.  The mushrooms were fine, but unremarkable.\n\nThankfully, the steak was the standout.  We each ordered a Prime filet cooked medium rare and each was cooked  and seasoned to perfection.  After consuming all that bread and the main course, I was glad we decided to bypass the appetizers to make room for the sticky pudding -- by far the best bread pudding I've ever had!  We shared one among the three of us.  And when my sister casually remarked that we were there for my birthday, they kindly (and under-statedly) provided a candle on my plate to celebrate my big day.

We ordered a 30 oz. \"bone in\" Rib Eye Steak--to be shared between two people.  What came out?  Two pieces of over cooked meat that were approximately 6 oz. each...and no bone.  The steak cost $67.00.  Very disappointed!!!!  Took forever to get the food, and then they brought us samples???\n\nI nearly got up and left before paying the check--that would have been a first.  Not that my waiter would have known, since he could never be found.  I rather stick with The Palms or Ruth Chris next time. This restaurant may be in need of Kitchen Nightmare rehab."

No not the kind you can imagine \"are you a f!@$%ing idiot\", \"oh sod off you bloody wank\", but something to the effect of, \"I respect you as a master of your craft, and I like what you've done with the place; very RED but the Tuna was a let down\". \n\nI won't be able to remember his name since it's been 2 months from having dined there but I sat at the interesting bar with red partitions in-between seats. One bartender started our drinks and another stepped in, maybe he was off for the night or taking a break but I much preferred the demeanour of the 2nd gentleman. Kind, helpful, he has two young children and works to support his family, loved him.\nI was there for the SEMA show with my then boss having a meal the night before coming back to SF. \n\nThe seared-foie-gras was tasty and had all sorts of textures and flavors. The cocktails were fancy and prepared with care. But wait for it....the Tuna was Tuna. Nothing special, nothing spectacular. It tasted like Tuna. I would think with all the buggering that Chef Ramsay gives to the struggling chefs around the world his Tuna would be above and beyond. Having mentioned this under my breath to my boss, the nice bartender/server quietly, unbenounced to me called over his manager to come have a chat with me. \n\nI don't like to complain unless the food is inedible, and so I was a bit shy when expressing my comments about my anti climatic meal to the manager in front of the bartender. But also pleased that he cared enough to do something rather than just let it be. It wasn't him that let me down but was the back of the house that did and he stepped up to rectify what went down. And the manager was equally as kind and generous, offering dessert and to remove the fish from our bill as well as acknowledging that comments such as mine are helpful to the upkeep of the high standards they strive for. I wouldn't have asked that but it was an awesome gesture to a fellow foodie who loves a good meal."

My friends flaked on some previous plans so I walked over to GRS and asked if I could get a table. They informed me that they were full booked but the bar offered a full menu and if I could find a seat I could have dinner.  Since I was alone this was easily  accomplished. I sat down at my table and a nice young lady immediately came over and asked if I needed anything.  I ordered a drink and asked for a menu.  My drink arrived promptly and was perfectly mixed.  After browsing the menu I knew what I had to have.  I've always wanted to try roasted bone marrow and of course I had to try Gordon Ramsay's signature dish of beef wellington.  Dinner started with a bread course.  The bread was absolute perfection.  Just enough crust for a good chew and the butter with sea salt set it off perfectly.  Then the bone marrow arrived.  It's served as three half bones arranged in a plate with another plate that contains 4 perfect little English muffins to spread the marrow on.  I've never had marrow before so I didn't know what I was getting into but let me say I loved it!  And I'll be having it again.  Finally the Beef Wellington arrived.  It was cooked perfectly.  Nice warm pink throughout and a perfect golden brown of pastry shell. It was seasoned well and very delicious.  The only bad part about the food was that I couldn't finish it all.  With the bread basket,  the English muffins with the marrow and the pastry shell around the beef I just got too stuffed. The only thing I would change about the place is the music In the bar area at least it was a bit loud."

Or server Chris was helpful, polite, and very attentive. We both ordered drinks and an appetizer to start. I had the HK Antioxidant and he had the STKhouse Martini. We ordered the Ricotta Ravioli. The portion was smaller than we expected, but it had a wonderful taste and we enjoyed trying something new by having an egg yolk in the ravioli. The bread they served was wonderful and the men who served the bread were knowledgable and explained each one. For our main meal we ordered the American Kobe beet, Beef Wellington, Loaded Baked Potato, and Brussels spouts.  The kobe beef melted in your mouth and was seasoned just right. I usually need A1 sauce for my steak, but with this one I didn't even think about it because it was seasoned so well. The beef wellington was also tender and flavorful. After seeing them make so many on HK I had to try it. It was a little on the salty side, but despite that I enjoyed it and could taste it in my mouth for days.  The sides were excellent and I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the Brussels sprouts. We wish we had room for dessert, but unfortunately we were way to full. Chris was attentive throughout our meal and was able to answer all questions we had.  He was a fun waiter and everyone there  greeted us and made us feel welcomed. Bonus, we saw Christina from HK working the line. I will defiantly be going to this restaurant again it was the highlight of my trip!"

As locals, we can appreciate celebrity chefs, but tend to save them for the special occasions. When I had made the reservations, it was rather easy. When it came time to alter them, it became a hassle. We had people drop off, join on, and all over the place. The restaurant took my credit card number for our large party and warned us about the $25 per person charge if we failed to notify them about any changes before the dining date.\n\nWhen the day came, our group came in spurts and so some of us waited at the bar until a majority came. Once sat, we saw that we were upstairs in the more private style rooms. Everyone must have been doing guys' night because it was a room full of men enjoying steaks. \n\nMy biggest issue with our dining experience has to do with seating. The flat seating with larger parties of 6 or more tends to slow down service. It took some time from getting sat to being able to order drinks. Part of it was due to our party not being complete, but sitting with beverages would have made it unnoticeable. I like the pace of the dining experience. Instead of pushing us to dine and get out, we were allowed to converse as we dine. The meat cart came around and the explanation of each cut and what makes them unique for varying palates was informative.\n\nThe drinks are presented on an Ipad. Their selection of whiskey, bourbons, and scotches is well rounded. Bookers, Glenlivet 12, and Oban 15 range from $12-$14. \n\nFor our table of seven; three ordered the 24oz. bone in ribeyes, 2 6oz. beef wellingtons, 1 14oz. NY strip, and an 8oz. filet. The wellington is prefaced with a 45 minute cooking time and a medium rare temp. After our late start, some of us were getting antsy about timing, but it was not a huge deal. The temp was over medium, but the filet was tender and the puff pastry was not too thick. Paired with the bourbon cream corn, it was enjoyable. I ended up splitting with one of my friends who got a ribeye and enjoyed his steak immensely. Especially with the roasted bone marrow. The topping of foie gras is beautiful as well. We also got the loaded baked potato, brussel sprouts, asparagus, and mushrooms for sides to share. There was some leftovers on most of the items, but I made sure to clear the corn and bone marrow. \n\nWe were all in pain by the time dessert came around. This was not a light meal by any means. I wish I had room for sticky toffee pudding, but all I could take was an espresso. Their coffee service comes with their complimentary ABC spoons. A for Amaretto white chocolate, B for Bailey's milk chocolate, and C for Chambord dark chocolate. They are shots encased in a bonbon and delicious."

There were even little mirrors (think the kind the dentist uses) so you could view the cuts of meat from every angle. Thought that was kind of funny. Anyways, on to the meal. \n\nBeef wellington- this is Ramsays go-to and is incredible. Just order it.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding- same as above. Not normally something I would order, but it was so good.\n\nOverall, a great restaurant in a city filled with great restaurants.

The server and chef were nice enough to offer another piece cooked but for a medium rare it was overcooked like other Yelpers here have mentioned. We also got the A5 to try, the flavor was there but it was a little too salted on the outside. \n\nAnyways, if you're looking to cross off eating Hell's Kitchen Beef Wellington off your bucket list then sure eat here , but don't expect anything spectacular to be honest.

Starting with the Scotch Egg, this so called delicacy was smaller than a golf ball. Perhaps the size of a large grape. Tasteless and boring. So we move on to the Spring Vegetable Salad. Now this was about 5 slices of green vegetable matter with a slice of tuna about the size of a postage stamp. Again tasteless and boring. So now it is time for the Mushroom Risotto. This was two tablespoons of Risotto and a nice sized Scallop in the center. This was excellent  but it was laughable to see this served on a large white dinner plate when it would have fit on a tea cup saucer and never even came close to the running off the edge. Ah, now the Beef Wellington. Have you seen the Beef Wellington that is served on Hell's kitchen? Forget about it.  You take one of those pieces you see on TV and cut it in half and serve two! I'm not kidding. Our Beef Wellington was about 3 inches wide by 2 inches high by 2 inches long. I could have had a 22 ounce Rib Eye for $100 less. So now dessert, the blueberry tart. This came with a piece of crust about 3 inches long and  1/2 inch wide. Not a standard tart shaped cup. It had about 8 blueberry's and a tablespoon of vanilla ice cream. It was good, but come on, this is what you get for $145 each? The wine's were about a 3 ounce pour each. A little more than a wine tasting. None of the wines were memorable. Kind of reminded us of what you get at Trader Joe's from the bottom shelf.  So the total bill for Martini's,Hell's Kitchen Tasting Dinner, Wine accompaniment plus tip for two people was just over $600!!! The service was excellent, 5 stars plus so they received their 20% because they earned it. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We wouldn't go back to Gordon Ramsay Steak even if we had a Groupon!"

Get the Beef Wellington. Seriously. It's so unbelievably tender and amazing; by far the best beef I've ever had in my entire life. There are no vegetarian options on the menu (it's a steakhouse after all) but a vegetarian could make a wonderful meal just from the side dishes. I went with 3 other diners and we each got a side: fingerling potatoes (they are the most AMAZING potatoes you will eat...perfectly roasted, delightfully salted, and you can definitely taste the truffle), mac & cheese (I imagine this is what they serve in heaven), caramelized  Brussels sprouts (very good), and the loaded baked potato. Skip the loaded baked potato in favor of the fingerlings. Double up on the mac & cheese. Heck, order a second Beef Wellington to go. I wish I had!\n\nEdited to add: We were really full and going to pass on dessert, but the waiter said the Sticky Toffee Pudding would be life changing. He was correct. \n\nFor those who care about ambiance, I thought this was a great place. It's intimate enough for a romantic date yet lively enough for a group. The music was set at a very good volume - loud enough to be noticeable and enjoyable and keep you from overhearing the people at the next table, not so loud that you have to shout to people at your own table."

The one constant I have learned about Gordon over the years, would be his passion for perfection.  I thought I would finally get to experience a small slice of this during my long awaited visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak in Vegas last night... but it didn't quite happen that way.   \n\nYou see, although the food was very good, and the service was more than adequate, a certain WOW factor was missing.\n\nLets start with the atmosphere.  It doesn't much look like a steak house, but rather a bold, trendy, neo- modernistic pub I guess.  The ceiling was festooned  with an enormous, in-your-face Union Jack whilst red glowing intestines dangled below to pass as a chandelier of some sort.  The music was much too loud for a fine dining type experience and the bare table  look, although trendy, is just not proper for fine dining.  The iPad cocktail menu was right at home though and the eye-candy hostesses with back seam stockings were somewhat of a show on their own.  \n\nI got the impression the waitstaff were hired on merit of looks alone as they seemed a bit awkward and were quite literally tripping over one-another.  They  would almost certainly be more comfortable as models rather than order takers.  I also got the distinct impression they were trying a bit too hard to turn tables.   The first such clue was a stern admonishment that the Wellington would take quite a while coming out of the kitchen and it may be wise to make another selection.  The second clue would have been the removal of our cocktail glasses without the offering of a second round.  But I guess the kicker would have been the fact that when we did leave, we hadn't gotten two or three steps away and actually bumped into the next guests as they were being ushered to sit down at our uncleaned and un-set former table.\n\nAll the food was probably just a tad under-cooked which is actually fine by me but not so much for my guests.  I thought the taste, temperature and presentation of the food was spot on.  Many will talk about the prices being to lofty but actually at this level, price is dictated more on demand and this place certainly has plenty of that for now.  Gordon could probably hike the prices by another 10% and still have sell-out nights.  The bread served with dinner was probably the most enjoyable course.  There is a certain buttery spread, with just a hint of cheese, provided that has such a perfect taste, texture and finish that it absolutely steals the show.  I was dissapointed to find the Alaskan Halibut was removed from the menu as I thought that would be one of the signature dishes.  Here's a free tip Gordon, update that little fact on the web-site menu so blokes don't turn up wanting a go at the Halibut only to learn is has been 86'd, ok mate?\n\nI still recommend a visit here though.  Not so much as a steak house to compete with the likes of Ruth's Chris or Mortons, but rather to experience the culture of trendy ambiance, flavor and fashion that has been assembled here with just the right amount of pretentiousness to prove captivating."

We had made reservations and were promptly seated when we arrived. We were greeted by our server Charles and well taken care of. We decided to splurge and partake in the \"Hells Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu\" as well as the pairings. It consisted of a scotch egg, potato & octopus salad, scallop risotto, roasted beef wellington, & a sticky toffee pudding. WOW! It was like I was punched in the mouth with awesome flavour when I tried my first bite of the scotch egg. The only part of the meal that was not amazing was the potato and octopus salad, too much mustard vinaigrette. At any other restaurant, and not paired with so much delicious awesomeness, it would have been great. The pairings with each meal was worth the extra price and the sommelier was supper friendly and knowledgable. She really knew her stuff! I think I am ruined for food after this experience. \n\nIf you want to see what real service and great food is all about I suggest that you try this restaurant.\n\nLink to a photo of my menu (they let you keep it): http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=pesHqvnnIS9mPx2TM2nUdA#pesHqvnnIS9mPx2TM2nUdA"

            "review": "I've been watching Gordon's show Kitchen Nightmare and instantly became a big fan but I certainly did not for his restaurant..I read revieiws a lot prior to my visit so my expectation was really high. \n\nThe service was alright..nothing specifically bad but FAR from spectacular. No one looked happy..they all looked tired or sick of working. \n\nDecor was interesting...maybe James Bond theme? but failure.. \n\nComplimentary bread looked so good in pictures but they were very bland. I did not care at all. For appetizer I had a beef tartar and beet salad. Beef tartar was AMAZING. Actually it was the best thing of all here. Beet salad was pretty good as well. \n\nFor entree I had a beef wellington his signature dish..mediocre at best. Beef was very tender though. Mac and Cheese was ok.. Their popular cocktail HK Antioxidant was good but nothing special at all.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the sticky toffee pudding. Sweetest thing on the earth..so sweet that I could not have more than one bite. Who could possibly finish that dessert??? Our server Jessica did a favor and poured ALL of the caramel sauce on top of it..you know what caramel sauce is made of? 100% sugar. Sorry to say this but this pudding was disgusting. \n \nAs some others mentioned, I was seated right next to the stairs where I could see inside skirts completely...I had no intention but had to see someone's bare butt...eww..Adding to that, what bothered me a lot was that every time someone went upstairs dusts coming out of the carpet and I felt like they were flying down on me or my food... \n\nOur server Jessica was nice but I felt ripped off when we saw our bill. $18 for water?? We thought we agreed to have regular water. We didn't want to bother to complain instead just deducted $20 of the tip we were going to leave. \n\nGordon Ramsey is a great entertainer but this place was a huge let down. Needless to say, I will never come back or even recommend to anyone."

It wasn't just the food - it was the service, ambiance, location, and company combined.\n\nCame here on a whim with a group of friends on our last night in Vegas. It was the perfect place to top off our trip. We didn't have any reservations, but managed to snatch a high top table in the lounge area. I actually think I prefer the lounge seating over the main dining area after walking through there - high top tables, high chairs, bar view, and an amazing, bold interior decor? Very sexy ambiance.\n\nOur server was absolutely spectacular. Never had a waitress top her yet! She was a super social and funny... I should have asked her name and now I regret it.\n\nThey had a huge variety of starter bread. I'm sure you'll find one that you like!\n\nI got the Filet (8oz, Prime Beef). Cooked to perfection, that's all I can say. I don't remember what what my friends got, but they all seemed to love it to death.\n\nWe shared 4 sides - all equally amazing: Flame Grilled Corn, Mac & Cheese, Vert (my personal favorite), and Sauteed Spinach. Yes... I would recommend them all!\n\nBill came out to be $330 before tip. \n\nThe only downside? We think my friend got food poisoned. LOL. I know, how STRANGE, especially since he was the only one suffering from the 4 hour drive back to LA that night... Yeah, it wasn't pretty. So, 1 star off for his terrible demise."

He was so informative about their menu and also asked us questions to see what direction we may to go in ordering. I told him that I had always wanted to try a true Japanese Wagyu and he excused himself from the table to see if the marbling was adequate on the Kobe for that particular evening. He brought out the a 3 oz sample for me to view.  I appreciated that extra step to make sure I was pleased.  Let me just say that it lived up to all the hype. It was seasoned to perfection not to change the flavor of the meat itself.  Fantastic!!! My wife had a Lobster Wellington.  She too was blown away by the flavor.  As for the side dishes we had an awesome mac n cheese and an asparagus that was way too salty.  But it did not warrant removing a star from my review.  As for the dessert we tried none other than the sticky toffee pudding that just blew us away.  Donnie made our evening a night to remember.  We went out to several restaurants during our stay in Vegas and enjoyed several great meals. Donnie on the other hand took our experience at Gordon Ramsay's Steak to a new level!!!!"

My wife ordered the Filet and I ordered the new york strip, both were very tastey. We order the truffled potatoes as a side which was pretty good. You might be wondering why I am giving it a one star if the food and service were so good. Well that night my wife and I were both extremely sick. We fasted all day to enjoy the food so I am certain we were sick from Gordon Ramsay Steak. We were up all night in the bathroom and are still feeling the effects two days later. To think that I paid 200 dollars to get sick leaves me very upset. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I knew it would be a little over priced just because it had Gordon Ramsay's name attached but paying that much money to get sick is just unacceptable."

            "review": "I came here for my 30th birthday based on the yelp reviews. We order the lobster and the pork belly appetizer, the rib cap, the beef wellington and of course the sticky toffee pudding. I also had a french pressed coffee as well.\n\nImpression: the place was loud, decor was busy, and the tables were way too close to each other. Every time I got up to go the the bathroom, my butt was in the faces of our neighbors and my butt was grazing their table. You can hear your neighbor's conversations.  I knew that this place was loud and busy, but for the menu prices, I expected a little more class or at least some space. Service was excellent. Our server was very attentive.\n\nFirst, the bread that came out was delicious and flavorful. \n\nSecond, the appetizers... the lobster was flavorful and tender and the chorizo flavor was not overpowering. I would get it again. The pork belly tasted like my father in laws sweet filipino pork dish called paksewlechon (I'm not filipino so I don't know if I spelled it right). I expected the pork belly to be more crisp and a different flavor,  I wasn't expecting a soft, tender and sweet pork belly. It was good, but I would not order it again. It was just too sweet for me.\n\nThird, the rib cap was good, but nothing memorable. I felt as though it was missing a good aged umami flavor of a quality steak. The beef wellington had a delicious flavor, but was lacking the firm exterior/flaky crust. It was kind of soggy.  Other than the soggy factor, it was delicious. I would rather have the kobe beef from Cut or a nice prime aged bone in ribeye with a nice sear than the wellington. The welling was too mushy. \n\nSides: We ordered the baked potatoe and the mac and cheese. Both were delicious and I would order them again.\n\nDessert: Sticky toffee pudding... the star of the meal. It was the BEST DESSERT I ever ate. I dream about that dessert. I would go back just to order the dessert. For an after dinner drink, I had the french pressed coffee... delicious coffee, I wish I can have it at my house everyday. It came with three chocolate covered spoons that had filling inside (bailey's,  amaretto,  and frangelico). \n\nBottom line: I would ONLY go back to get the sticky toffee pudding. There are better places for steak with a nicer environment and the same price."

I went with some friends to celebrate a birthday and everyone from the moment we walked through the door provided incredible service. \n\nSince all of my companions are in the food service industry, staff could have been overly familiar and not provided the best experience but that was NOT the case. \n\nFood: scallop risotto was 2 bites of perfectly prepared heaven. Beef Wellington was exquisite. Hamachi had a nice twist. The 3 other cuts of beef were all on point. Side dishes were all unique and tasty. Desserts were to die for. Seriously, there wasn't one thing that I wouldn't want to eat again. \n\nThe night got hazy because wine was plentiful but there's one thing I'm certain of: I'd be hard pressed to have another epic steakhouse experience like this one."

            "review": "Oh Gordon Ramsay, how I secretly love your ballistic rantings to sub par kitchen staff on television! And I also love your food!\n\nMy recent trip to Vegas was highlighted by an excellent meal at Gordon Ramsay Steak, where the service was BEYOND excellent and the food, delicious! There were so many layers of flavors going on, my palate was desperately trying to figure out how they could work so well together. \n\nFirst let's address the service. We had an 8pm reservation and were told to wait in the bar while our table was being prepared. When I saw my favorite tequila Clase Azul behind the bar,  I knew I was in a for a treat here, so naturally that's how I started my visit. We were seated about 5 minutes later in an upstairs table overlooking the main restaurant and our server was there within 2 minutes to greet us. And after that point, I don't believe there was a 15 sec period of time where someone from the wait staff or maitre de were not walking by quietly observing our table to make sure we had everything we needed. It was amazing honestly. My partner was a bit clumsy and dropped his knife. Two minutes later a new knife appeared. He dropped his spoon an hour later, boom, new spoon and napkin. Great service indeed!\n\nThe food now is a whole new topic because frankly it was divine. I started with a  lobster sausage appetizer and my partner had the blue crab soup. Both were excellent and the soup had a small amount of \"heat\" to it, not overwhelming but just enough for a little kick. Next up I decided to go with the Gordon classics, Beef Wellington while my partner had a NY Strip and two sides. Mac and Cheese and the most incredible Brussels Sprouts I think I've ever tasted. I had to ask the waiter how they were made and he revealed they were finished with bacon and apple cider vinegar. Nice!  The beef wellington was excellent as was my friends steak. But the absolute star of the night is the Sticky Toffee Pudding, another of Gordon's classics. Holy Mother Mary of God! The cake was light but filled with the most delicious toffee sauce I've ever tasted! Do yourself a favor and save room for this dessert because it is worth every calorie!\n\nThis is truly a special night out meal when you're in Vegas, and surprisingly since we didn't order wine and only had a few cocktails the meal was not that expensive considering where you are dining. But of course I'm coming from a NY cost of living mentality so bare that in mind, but this is definitely a place I'll book again."

It was, in all honesty, the day before Thanksgiving and quite possibly the \"B\" team was manning the kitchen with the \"A\" team on holiday ...It's a guess.... but I regress. We stopped in hungry and without a reservation but rather than make us wait, reception offered a bar table that was perfect! Us tall people love bar height tables! Service was good and they were BUSY. Now the food ....I ordered a NY strip bone in  med-rare with a baked potato. My steak was overcooked and had a \"burnt taste\" ....tasted as if they either over seared it or the grill wasn't clean. Really sported a bitter off taste. My wife ordered the same steak but med-well. she added a lobster tail as well. Our plates arrived and it was obvious the lobster was raw. She sent that back only to have it return rubbery. Her steak was rare  Really rare ..to the raw side but we were both hungry and ate what we could. Not sure but they may have switched our steaks but hers was definitely raw to rare rather then my med-rare request. Potato and wine (nice glass of Merlot) were very good. When the server returned we pointed out the lobster issue and my wife's steak being raw. The check arrives and she said the took the lobster off but left the steak on the bill. I did not feel quite compensated for a bad experience but ready to go i paid an left. Lot's of great steak houses on the strip and maybe we hit a stinker of a night but I would go elsewhere next time. Too bad."

            "review": "You know I don't write a lot of reviews, my usage of yelp is usually confined to looking up what everyone else writes to make a judgment call on where to take my wife and family.  But tonight I had an amazing dinner and wanted to share that experience with the fine readers of yelp.\n\nFirst let me say I'm not a foodie per say, I do enjoy a nice meal but I'm probably not as critical as many of the reviews you will find here.  Kitchen and wait staffs are the backbone of a restaurant and also human so I tend to be forgiving if things are not perfect.  That being said I was truly amazed tonight for a few different reasons.\n\nThe first and foremost was the food.  I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsey, his no bullshit take on things and get back to basics approach is rare in a Michelin stared chef, but I'm a fan so I had to eat at Gordon Ramsey Steak.  I just had to.   So my expectations of a touristy restaurant were not massive. Culinary excellence is what I got, and I have to admit that it's the best steak I've had here in Vegas, grilled to perfection and cooked properly.  Something that is very rare when you order medium rare steaks. In fact it was so good and rich that I couldn't eat my side Honestly the best steak I've had here in Las Vegas. The beet salad was most excellent as well.  I wanted it to be, I mean it was in like every episode.\n\nBut that's actually not what made this whole thing amazing, nor was it the wall o' steak they truck out (with waiter provided descriptions!), although it was impressive.  But instead it was the people...\n\nMy waiter, an interesting guy named Chris, was the best waiter I have ever had - bar non, period, full stop, and I mean that.  He's a nice guy and knows what he's talking about.  Very professional, very articulate and very right - on everything - I mean that.  I've traveled around the world, and I've eaten at many places but Chris is the best waiter I had.  So you need to give this guy a raise - he knows how to treat a person, not a customer - a person and for him alone I would go back.  The food is just icing on the cake.  See the wait staff experience is a critical part of the meal and I think a lot of restaurateurs forget that, having a goo server can make or break the meal.  The food came out quickly and at the right time.  That is a choreograph of the kitchen and the waiter, he did that dance well as did the kitchen.  \n\nThe second reason I love this place were the amazing couple who sat next to me, and took pity on a lowly engineer far from home and missing his family badly.   I know this is a food review but this needs to be mentioned and take one for ambiance.\n\nI'm a fan of the show. So with the sampler menu (which looked amazing) you get a signed little photo and man I wanted that photo but alas I cant eat shellfish so the amazing looking scallops are not something that would be good for me, so I'm out.  I guess they heard me pleading with my waiter or probably saw me staring at my phone at my wife and kids and offered to give me their extra photo.  I couldn't do that, they are fans too but they forced me to begrudgingly take the photo and that meant a lot to me.  Not having the photo but more about an act of human kindness to a lonely guy here by himself for work.  It makes me have faith in the world, and I promise (if you are reading this) I will pay that forward! Remember the cookies!\n\nPeople are nice and wonderful and you meet them occasionally - I did. It really gave me faith in the human spirit.\n\nThe last reason why this place rocked my socks was the sticky toffee pudding - now I am not a massive fan even dating back to my time living in England (So I've had legit sticky toffee pudding in so many different places - pubs, restaurants, peoples homes etc.), its ok but there are better deserts out there. Now my wife is a massive fan of sticky toffee pudding so I thought well I'll get it as an homage to her since I miss her so.  \n\nMy god it was amazing, jesus it was good and I don't even really like it that much! Seriously, if you like sticky toffee pudding or caramel skip the steak and get the pudding, it was miraculous.  Well don't skip the steak, it was amazing as well and to skip it would be a massive mistake.  \n\nIt's a tourist restaurant, but the food is amazing, the staff is incredible.  So while it's a tourist restaurant but not really.  Gordon Ramsey Steak is a legitimate fine restaurant and you should think of it that way.  My only wish is that I didn't eat there alone, don't do it if you don't have to.  It's a meal that needs to be shared and talked about.  Order different things, and share because everything I had was amazing but I only had a small portion of what I could have gotten. If you do go there by yourself I hope you luck out and have nice neighbors like I did, they truly made my day, and if you do see someone alone there be nice to them.\n\nMan that sticky toffee pudding was good, I mean the ribeye was excellent but man that sticky toffee pudding was good."

We had various small bites brought to us, so I don't think they were on-menu, but presentation was exquisite and service was excellent.\n\nMy favorite part of the entire meal was dessert: a delicious cake with brown butter ice cream. My pastry chef friend told me the secret to the cake was the use of pureed sweet figs in the batter...genius. It was moist, fluffy and memorable. Paired with the ice cream, it was a 5-star dessert for me.\n\nThe atmosphere is loud and nearly club-like. I wasn't there on a romantic outing so I enjoyed the vibe.

Since I was staying at the Paris hotel, I thought what the heck, give GR steak a try.  \n\nThe first aspect I noticed about the restaurant is that all the employees were impeccably dressed.  It was interesting leaving the outskirts of Paris and enter the swanky, sexy, vibrant ambiance that GR so carefully detailed to mimic London.  The service was excellent.  It was clearly obvious that everyone is really well trained and service is probably what is the most important aspect about GR Steak, \n\nUnfortunately, service does not give you 5 stars in my book.  Even though our chorizo stuffed maine lobster was well executed, our American Wagyu filet and rib cap was a big disappointment.  The steaks were under seasoned and lacked flavor.  I could have understood that maybe with the filet, but unforgivable for a rib cap.  I ended up asking for sea salt just to give the meat a little flavor.  \n\nAfter spending over $350 on dinner, my thoughts turned immediately to Mon Ami cafe where I could have enjoyed the same taste of steak for a 1/3 of the price."

We started with a couple of apps -- chorizo-stuffed lobster and crispy pork belly.  Seriously, I wanted to lick the plate.  Hubby got a huge bone-in rib eye, and I got the 8oz Wagyu filet.  We were both in a beef coma afterwards.  So savory and tasty and mm-mm-good.  We ordered sides of creamed corn and roasted brussel sprouts, both of which were excellent.  And finally, we topped it off with GR's signature sticky toffee pudding.  We waddled out of the restaurant 2 hrs later, comfortably stuffed, and not nearly as light in the wallet as we were expecting to be.  BOTTOM LINE -- EXCELLENT MEAL, MAKE RESERVATIONS EARLY."

He took us on a steak journey by showing us all the steaks in which we had an option of ordering ! Everyone was extremely attentive. Everything we had was exceptional! Starting with the bread and ending with with the amazing sticky toffee pudding ! If you are looking for a great steakhouse this is it! Look no further! Great experience !"

We were extremely excited, the customer service was great and the meat cart presentation was really interesting. I had the 24oz rib eye and my bf had the Japanese Wagu Kobe beef. WOWOWOW!!! The Kobe beef seriously melts in your mouth, it's pretty pricey, so if u wanna just taste it, I would recommend trying the minimum serving of 3 oz. It's definitely worth it. I've never had anything like it. My rib eye was huge and perfectly cooked. For sides we had the fingerling potatoes and the mac and cheese, and UNLESS you L O V E garlic I wouldn't recommend. I probably wouldn't order either side again."

Said they would be working as a team for us tonight.\n\nGuess someone's got to pay the bills lol.  And i haven't gotten into the decor, but it's what you expect from a high-end steakhouse.\n\nOrdered the Royal long bone ribeye, amazing tenderness & seasoning.

But I'll get to that later.\n\nWe booked our reservation a little late so we weren't supposed to arrive until about 9:00PM, but we showed up at 8:45PM and they were able to seat us within 10 minutes. We waited inside the bar/lounge area while a waitress brought us the iPad so that we could determine our drinks. I got Pimm's Lemonade (it's so good! I'm not sure how much alcohol was in it, but I'm a heavyweight and after three of them, I was feeling pretty good LOL it goes down just like juice!) and Steve V. got a gin and tonic.\n\nFor the appetizer, we had the fried oysters. Steve doesn't like fried oysters but he loved the ones they served here! The batter is very buttery and delicious and I would probably get them again. For our entrees, Steve got the New York Strip with the bone marrow sauce and I got the Beef Wellington. The New York Strip had this odd, yet exhilarating salty crust to it. It was quite delicious. Of course, the Beef Wellington was very good. The crust was buttery and flaky and slightly sweet. For the sides, we had the asparagus (I'm usually not picky with asparagus but I did think the asparagus was here was a little bland. I would suggest you pass on it.) and the mac and cheese (super delicious! The truffle wasn't too overbearing!).\n\nNow, my favorite part of dinner was the dessert. We got the French-Pressed Coffee and it came with these chocolate flavor spoons. The coffee itself was super fresh! I loved it. Just a fair warning though -- Steve and I don't react to coffee. I can drink several cups from my French Press at home during dinner and I can still sleep like a baby. However, both of us stayed awake until about 4:00AM because of that dang coffee, so be careful with it! For our actual dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding. IT WAS SO BOMB OMG. I don't eat sweets that much -- Steve will order something and I will have maybe a bite or two and be done with it. I almost couldn't hold myself back from this. We had an equal sharing of the cake and ice cream and it was unbelievable. If you go in there for only one thing, that Sticky Toffee Pudding would be it.\n\nAll in all, we were very satisfied with our experience. It was a very high and expensive bill, but in our eyes, it was well worth it."

I must say when I walked in past the doorways the place looked magnificent. I loved the modern look that it had when you got past the tunnel. The lights in the center of the restaurant were pretty cool and what the lights represented were cool too.\n\nTIP!!!! Now first things first! For all of you new people who are going to dine here for the first time. When they ask you if you want Still or Sparkling water keep in mind BOTH cost money. If you want free water like myself then ask for TAP water! Or your going to be charged!\n\nNow that that is out of the way onto the food! I ordered the rib eye cooked medium. And when it came out it looked great and was cooked to how it was supposed to be cooked. The only complaint I had was a small portion of my steak was seared a bit too much so the crust was very hard.\n\nMy girlfriend got a filet cut which was very tender but the center was about a medium rare compared to the medium that she ordered. But it was very tender and flavorful and in my opinion was better than my rib eye.\n\nWe also ordered two sides. The pureed mashed potatoes which were creamy and delicious and the asparagus which were cooked very nicely.\n\nI honestly did like the restaurant but I feel there are other steakhouses that can beat this one. \n\nHave fun!"

The tomato bisque was the best thing.\n\nAt the end of our meal I went over to ask Christine if she would take a picture with me. She had been doing this all night.

The hostess let us know that if we were not there by 6:30pm, they would have to give up our table. So my boyfriend and I are literally RUNNING down the strip (in my brand new heels, might I add) and luckily, get there by 6:30. We end up having to wait 20 minutes to even get seated. \n\nOur server brings us bread and asks how we're doing. We tell her our bad experience with the hostesses and she brings the manager, who was extremely unaccommodating and only made excuses. \n\nWe order a couple appetizers, a ribeye, a wagyu, and a few sides. We get our food and... our wagyu steak is burnt. We felt bad sending it back, but if you're going to be shelling out $34/oz, might as well get it right.\n\nWe pay for our bill and head back to our hotel. My boyfriend realizes that he left his credit card back at the restaurant. He calls and the hostess tells him that they will leave it at the front desk. We get to the front desk and no credit card. We go back to the restaurant and speak with the same manager who sends us in another direction. Still no card. We're going back and forth and he's telling us a different excuse every time. We end up waiting for a good 30 minutes when he finally figures out where the card is. No apologies whatsoever. We would have had a better dining experience eating at a food court."

The beef wellington is bland, the pastry came out soggy, and it just wasn't cohesive.. it really is just a chunk of meat wrapped in loose puff pastry. The ribeye was dry and flavourless. Very disappointed considering the emphasis they place on hand selecting and aging their meats. The $7 foie butter was reasonable for the 3 massive chunks served but it was also 3 times more than what you need for a single steak...would rather pay half the price for 1 piece but this is Vegas. They charged $9pp for 1 bottle of sparkling water then stopped offering any water refills once the bottle ran out - we had to flag waiters down for just table water refills. The only thing we did enjoy was the mac n cheese side dish. $300 for an incredibly disappointing meal that we couldn't even finish because of how flavourless the meat was"

Charming, attentive, and extremely helpful in guiding us through the dining experience with apt recommendations. We will definitely be asking for him again when we return.\nStarting with the drinks:\nYou order your drinks first before they even bring a menu. They had an interactive menu on an iPad just for drinks. I ordered one of the best cocktails I've had (The Drifter), kudos to the bartender. My wife commented about the presentation, it was art in a glass.\nNext, you get your food menu. We needed some help deciding and Dennis jumped in with some great recommendations. It never felt pushy, just his sincere likes, which was awesome.\nI should mention people seated on either side arrived at similar times to us and some of them ordered appetizers, some just entrees. The timing of everything coming out of the kitchen was remarkable. They got it all just right on all of the surrounding tables.\nThe bread basket was delicious. Don't eat too much of it though! We made that mistake.\nThen our appetizers arrived. We had one ounce of caviar, onion soup, and a salad. All of them were fantastic. The caviar had all the usual stuff you would expect plus a few extras like candied lemon zest, which I didn't try but my wife said tasted great. The soup was subtle unlike most onion soup, which made the other flavors jump out. It was awesome.\nThe steaks then came out. I had the bone-in ribeye (bring your appetite) and my wife had the american kobe rib cap. Both were perfectly seared and cooked just right to our order. We also had a few sides which were all extremely tasty (especially the fois gras).\nThe meal was pricey but worth every penny for the overall experience. The only thing that would've made it better is if we had expletives hurled at us from the kitchen (it is a Gordan Ramsay restaurant). Oh well, maybe next time."

            "review": "Worth it.  Totally worth it.\n\nThe meal progressively got better, which was fortunate, since it started on somewhat of a weak note, in my opinion.  Let me explain.\n\nI was traveling with someone who had some dietary restrictions, but since we prefer to share dishes (allows us try more when we go out), I had to be picky with the appetizer selection.  I went with the gnocchi, when I wanted the tartare; no biggie; #fwp, amirite?\n\nWell, the gnocchi were simply underwhelming.  I've had better pasta with a more pillow-like, yet firm texture, with a more manageable size (these were too small).  Composing a complete bite was a challenge, and there wasn't enough of an acidic element to counterbalance the density of the potato or the earthiness of the mushroom.  Still, it was very good, and probably better than starters you will find in most three-four star restaurants.  \n\nMy companion had the chorizo-stuffed lobster, and this was a huge success.  Not quite British, to my knowledge, but I welcome insight from our friends from across the pond.  Regardless, the flavor was everything you would hope for.  Briny, sweet, savory, classy... just worked on every cylinder, and really incited the taste buds as any good prelude should.  The sauce was of particular note as showcasing some exceptional skill in the kitchen.\n\nEntr\u00e9es were no less wonderful, though I do have a bit of a complaint regarding my dish, the signature Beef Wellington.  The plate seemed to have been assembled well in advance of receiving the steak.  Thus, the demi-glac\u00e9 was nearly tar-like in consistency, which was tragedy considering the flavor it still possessed.  A similarly tragic fate befell the pur\u00e9e, but as these were more garnish than substantive sides, I'm fine with the what I presume was a rare misstep.  Keep an eye on this one, though, kitchen staff.\n\nMy companion's steak was beyond reproach, though, and the lack of adornment was probably the better way to go here.  She ordered the rib cap, and it was exactly as advertised: tender like a filet, but full flavored like a rib-eye (or even a perfectly meaty short-rib).  Stellar.  Amazing.  I wish I were more of a rib-eye fan, but the filet is my preferred cut.  C'est la vie.  This was a perfect steak, though, truly worth the hype, and well worth the praise.\n\nSides were a surprise, and in a good way.  The mac-n-cheese had a great blend of cheeses, not too heavy on any one flavor.  Including the bleu, which I was a tad worried about.  It was a rich and creamy blend, which by itself was a worthwhile addition.  The ginger shiitakes, by contrast, were brightly flavored, much like a teriyaki dish.  Fresh and full of ginger, soy, sweet, and savory (umami, if you believe in that), this dish was an eye-opener.\n\nBUT!  Try this, if you dare.  \"Stuff\" a mushroom cap with a forkfull of the mac-n-cheese, and give that a go.  You can thank me later.  \n\nWe weren't going to order dessert, as we were already very full.  We had heard and read the rave reviews about the sticky toffee pudding, and it just had to be tasted.  This was probably the best part of the entire meal, and we are so glad we didn't miss out on it.  Succulent, savory, sweet, warming... just... I have no words.  And, others have already described it in incredible detail, so I'm not going to be able to add much more to the discussion.  Save to say, they are right, it's just that good, simply amazing.  All the ingredients work perfectly.  Winner, hands down.\n\nService.  Our waiter, Dennis I believe, was beyond reproach.  I would recommend him again in a heartbeat, without question.  Playful banter, but not overbearing.  Eye contact and smiles, friendly attitude, just an all around perfect service.  The bartender (did not get a name; tall blonde woman) was equally charming and inviting.  She made wonderful 'mocktails' for my companion, and the actual cocktails were expertly blended.  We had the same amiable outreach from her station as well, which is always a cornerstone to a successful restaurant.  I did notice dour glances and less-than-enthusiastic emotions from other servers, though, but mostly from the hostesses.  Not all, but some.  I can see how some reviewers would have negative comments regarding the service here.  Dennis, though, really made the meal complete.  Also, the floor manager (different tall blonde woman) was very attentive to all the tables, ours included, and controlled the floor efficiently and with a calm yet friendly demeanor.\n\nAmbiance: There were nice nods to London, including the tube, the Union Jack on the ceiling, and definitely in the menu.  It was not overly themed, but it was omnipresent and subtle.  \n\nOverall: Well worth the visit, glad we tried it, and we would definitely come back again.  Maybe some different starters next time, but the mains were spot on, and the dessert has to happen every single time I'm in Vegas again.  Seriously.  That was just too delicious."

The oysters and kind crab legs were fresh and presented in such as clean manner.  Legs were more or less de-shelled and sliced and then placed back on a half shell for presentation purposes.  Even the little cartilege spine you find down the middle sometimes was removed.  Oysters cleaned and shucked perfectly.  Both came with a variety of sauces and tobasco to your liking.  I'm not a fan of large oysters, but the smaller ones were sweet, juicy, and with a little taste of ocean in each bite.  Excellent, rich seafood appetizers that won't spoil your appetite.\n\nFor our main courses, my wife's confit chicken was incredible.  I had a few bites of hers.  The chicken skin was removed and deep friend into a salty potato chip like thing.  Almost like a thin pork rind.  If you are familiar with filipino lechon, the skin was like a thin chicharon.  I could eat these all day until I had a heart attack.  The chicken itself was juicy and tender.  My wife said that it was probably the best chicken dish she has ever had.  I, of course, got the famous Beef Wellington.  It was kind of a must try.  The first few bites were pretty amazing, but I have to admit that I kind of wanted just a pure, unadulterated steak at the end.  The beef was so soft and delicious, I started to feel like the liver and puff pastry were getting in the way.  It is still a must have, but next time I may try a wagyu ribeye or filet just to get the pure richness of a quality steak.\n\nDessert was another must have.  The sticky toffee pudding is just excellent,  I've only had it once before when I was in London, and I remembered liking it back then too.  It is a rich, decadent dessert.  Like eating honey that was somehow made into a slice of cake.  I'm usually a chocolate fan, but this was really good and unusual to find in american restaurants.\n\nAll together, my wife and I really enjoyed Steak.  Everything about it... the food, the service, the atmosphere were top notch.  It was pricey, but we both felt like it was money well spent."

It was high in price as well but that is to be expected in LV.

The beef did not taste like it was seasoned, and the puff pastry around it was soggy. It tasted very plain and after a while I felt like I was just chewing plain meat because there was no flavor!! AND THERE WAS A SMALL HAIR IN MY FOOD !!!! \n\nAlso, my friend's potato puree was literally falling off her plate when it was given to her and I did not know there as a charge of $9 for water. Service was not that great, and our waiter did not say anything when we left. no bye, no thanks for coming, just looked at us when we left and NOT A WORD. You pay a lot and you don't even get good service or get good food. I was very excited to try this restaurant because I love Gordon Ramsay, but I suggest saving your money for better food elsewhere. I left very disappointed and hungry."

Had a medium rare ribeye advertised as prime cut but the meat was pretty tough.   I've had choice cuts that were less tough.  A person at the table had temp issues with the 3rd steak finally being correct.  $12 for a cup of french press coffee which gets shared with other people who order coffee! Really???  For $12 I want my own french press and my own creamer!  It's these types of celebrity chef branded restaurants that will keep me away from other ones in the future.  I'd rather eat at a place where they have to earn their money each night than and one that relies on a TV personality brand.  Plus I think the iPad for the cocktails was stupid and not practical.

It's nice to see a restaurant function like a piece of well-oiled machinery.\n\nOur server Matthew was absolutely WONDERFUL. If you are headed there, request him - I know I will the next time I'm there.\n\nWe enjoyed a half bottle of Duckhorn Merlot that was lovely. Our appetizer was the Kurobuta Pork Belly with grits - tasty and not overly filling. My boyfriend being the GR fan that he is ordered the Beef Wellington which was, of course, divine. I ordered the Lamb entree, which (unfortunately) was incorrectly prepared medium-well the first time around. BUT - Matthew was on it and visited our table right after I had sliced into the chop, and whisked the plate away with the sincerest of apologies and a promise to bring fresh sides. We had the Mac & Cheese and Sauteed Spinach sides - AWESOME, I swear the spinach was a whole bag's worth and absolutely delicious. It took a little while to bring my re-fired lamb back, but when it came (with fresh sides) it was wonderful. We also enjoyed a tasting menu of deserts: apple tart, Toffee Pudding (YOU MUST ORDER THIS), and [chocolate thing that was so delicious but I don't know what it was]. Enjoyed some delicious French-pressed coffee as well.\n\nOVERALL a fantastic experience with all the frills of fine-dining but without the snooty, uppity atmosphere that I've encountered. The restaurant is super modern and very visionary - don't expect to have a quiet meal because the restaurant is somewhat noisy.  BUT you will experience great service and excellent food.\n\nThanks Matthew for a memorable and WONDERFUL evening!"

            "review": "Let me start off this review by saying that I had the highest expectations prior to dining here.  After all, watching chef Gordon Ramsay and his explosive temper on shows like \"Hell's Kitchen\" and \"Kitchen Nightmares\" -- he's supposedly ALL about quality control. \n\nIf you plan on dining here, make sure that you call in advance for reservations.  And you have to CALL, they don't take any internet or open table reservations.  I called a week before for a table for two and was only able to get the last seating for 10pm on a Sunday evening.  When you call during their off hours, you are connected to the hotel, which is a little inconvenient.  You have until 3pm on the day of to cancel or else your credit card is automatically charged $50 per person.  If you have commitment issues, then there's first come first serve seating available at the bar, but the bar is LOUD.  Volume level here is on \"Euro Club BLAST\" and you can barely have a decent conversation.  But who goes to a bar in Vegas for 'conversation'... right??? No?? *wink*\n\nThe entrance to the restaurant is intriguing -- a tunnel, designed after the cityscape of Great Britain, I assume. But enough of me talking about the ambiance and the music -- lets get to the \"meat\" of this review -- the FOOD.\n\n[Libations]\nSouthside 14: What's in it? On the menu, it says: Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Champagne, Plymouth gin, lime & mint.  But there's a little bit of Vegas \"magic\" in it... super strong. Of course, I was drinking on an empty stomach -- and with our 10pm reservation, I was so hungry I would have eaten the mint leaves in the cup.  It's served with a strainer on the top of the cup to keep from drinking all the crushed mint pieces, aw shucks.  Refreshingly minty and clean, the alcohol went straight to my head and I was Asian-glowing after three sips.\n\nAlso ordered a glass for red and white, but I can't remember what they were. Sorry. The Southside 14 was so strong!!!\n\n[Appetizers]\nMaine Lobster: Chorizo stuffed Maine lobster, butter-poached and brandied lobster cream sauce, sweet corn. Mmmm. Perfectly poached and the flavors were delicately balanced.  The cream sauce didn't overpower the taste of the lobster and the chorizo inside was definitely a pleasant surprise for my already-entertained palette.\n\nKurobuta Pork Belly: braised Swiss chard, grilled apricot, hazelnut butter.  This dish is so rich.  I love my share of pork belly, but I was \"over it\" after two bites.  Definitely a must try for the pork lover, but I think I'll pass on this the next time around.\n\n[Main Dish]\nRoasted Beef Wellington: I had to try it.  I wanted to know what all the fuss was about in Hell's kitchen.  Why can't the chefs get this dish right?!?! Oh... but now I understand.  Is it the best piece of meat I've had in my life? No.  But I have to give mad props to the level of skill and cooking technique that goes into this dish.  The inside of the steak is medium rare, with a ring of medium well around the outer part of the steak -- which is wrapped in a perfectly baked layer of puff pastry -- like a little present for my taste buds.\n\nLoup de Mer* (Mediterranean sea bass): If I were to close my eyes and someone were to feed me the fish, I could easily mistake it for the side dish fish that comes with the meals at BCD Tofu House.  Taste was simple -- like the lobster appetizer, I love how I can taste the fish and it's not masked in sauces.  But, not remarkable. Another pass for the next time I'm here.\n\n[Sides]\nBrussels sprouts:  AHHH (wait for it...)MAZING! Amazing!\nMac & Cheese: FANTASTIC.  You can taste the truffle oil and the various cheeses. \n\n[Dessert]\nSticky Toffee Pudding: Okay, so honestly, I'm writing this review because I wanted to rave about this dessert.  The other items on this list, you can choose to ignore my opinion, if anything, make sure you leave room for this dessert.  It's a must try. I never knew the combination of sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee and brown butter ice cream could be so heavenly.\n\nI might have given this place only three stars.  Perhaps I came with too high of expectations or was turned off at their reservation-taking methods -- but overall, the meal was uneventful.  Cooking techniques are exquisite and everything tastes clean, simple, and effortless -- but was it \"sinful\" by vegas standards? Hardly. \n\n What merits the 4th star??? The Sticky Toffee Pudding."

The hostess' outside the restaurant were very friendly and escorted us into the restaurant. As we were seated, our waiter arrived and gave us an iPad. When I made a reservation at the restaurant, I let them know that it was for a birthday dinner. The waiter just asked who's birthday is it? And I said mine. He just looked at me and said oh happy birthday with no enthusiasm and stated that there were over 40 selections of beers to choose from and cocktails, and just left. After waiting over 15 minutes, our waiter comes by and takes our drink orders. \n\nWe finally ordered our entrees and our waiter continued to have almost like a cocky attitude. Never smiled. Never said thank you. Never even asked if we had any questions about the menu. He just said are you ready? I ordered our appetizer and my entree and our waiter looked at my boyfriend and said 'and u, what are you ordering?' It almost felt as if he was talking down on him. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp cocktail $19. Three jumbo shrimp in a refreshing sauce. The watermelon cubes complemented the dish well! I loved the little salt on the watermelon also. The salt enhances the watermelon flavor in a unique way. I ordered the braised short ribs $40. The meat was a little fatty, but flavor wise it was good. It could have a little more salt. The spinach that came with the dish was very salty though. My boyfriend got the filet $54. The filet was good, but we had better tasting filets. The meat was not as tender as we wished. Our sides we ordered were Mac n cheese $13 and brussel sprouts $12. Both the sides were delicious. The Mac n cheese has to be the winner tho! \n\nFlying from Hawaii to celebrate my 25th birthday here I was expecting a better experience. At the end of our meal, our waiter just dropped off the dessert menu and said our toffee cake is the best and rushed off. We ended up not getting dessert. No complementary dessert was even offered. I expected a place like this would offer something small for a birthday or anniversary celebration, but I guess not. The saying \"Don't expect anything because you'll only be disappointed\" was how I felt about this whole experience. \n\nWould not recommend this place. Food is good, but there are plenty of delicious places on the strip. Not a very romantic setting. Loud. Did not feel special. Waiter sucked."

With not much gristle either - just a nice, thick cut of meat. \n\nAfter all the he hype on the beef Wellington, The table was split on whether to try it or not. None of us have had before and were intrigued. But after the knowledgeable waitress gave us her honest opinion we decided to order our own dishes and all split the Wellington 3 ways. I'm very glad we did that; the Wellington ended up being just \"okay,\"  almost like an overpriced empanada. Thanks to the waitress (if I can only remember her name)  for saving us from regret that night. \n\nAll sides were awesome too, including fingerling potatoes, Ramsey's special mac&cheeze, and creamed corn (by far the best). \n\nNo meal is complete without desert: we had the signature toffee pudding cake and French press coffee. The coffee was good but it did seem like they were trying to hard when they brought 3 chocolate covered spoons with different shots of liquor to add to your coffee. Didn't try any of them as I'm not a big fan of amaretto, bailey's or any other alcohol in my coffee.\n\nA quick suggestion if you're a wine drinker: bring your own bottle. The markup is atrocious (seriously, the $35 prisoner was listed at $120 and the $60 caymus was listed at $180, the caymus special reserve that normally goes for $130 was at an astonishing $340."

            "review": "By far, the best meal I've ever had.  From start to finish the experience, meal, and service was the best.  My fiancee and I had a reservation for Thursday evening, and checked in a few minutes before.  While they waited for a hostess to return from seating the couple in front of us, the General Manager, Michael, greeted us and was very nice and welcoming.  We were promptly seated and had a great seat facing the kitchen, which in most restaurants would've been inconvenient, but it was great to watch such a beautiful kitchen work! Not to mention we got to smell the amazing foods as they were prepared and expedited.  \n\nOscar was our server and he was outstanding.  We came ready to try it all, so we didn't need any up-selling but Oscar described items that we were deciding on in ways that sounded so delectable we just couldn't resist.  \n\nWe both ordered a cocktail: I had the 'Mr. Jitters' Coffee Old Fashioned and it was delicious! I love a good old fashioned, and I'm a huge coffee fan, so I had to try it and I loved it.  I could've lived without the chocolate drizzle/coffee half rim, as it was really too sticky to add to the drink, but every other component was perfect.   She had the El Matador (I think?) Margarita.  It was a Mango-Habanero margarita, with a fresh fruit puree, which really balanced the spice nicely and only gave a hint of spice in the aftertaste.\n\nThe bread plate was good from what I tried, but I only sampled a couple of the options, as I was saving room for all the food.   \n\nFor the appetizer, Oscar recommended the off-menu side of scallops.  As a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, I know he's a stickler for how scallops are cooked, and so I had to try them.  I've only had scallops once and they were overcooked and chewy so I was nervous, but they were incredible.  Like butter, the knife slid right through it, and the scallop was perfectly seasoned and melted in my mouth.  \n\nDinner:  I had to order the Beef Wellington, and I was absolutely not disappointed.  At first when it came out, I wasn't even sure how to cut it without losing the pastry.  And as I began to cut into it, I was worried that it might not be as tender as I expected, but boy was I wrong.  I took the first bite and it was juicy and tender and incredibly flavorful.  The pastry was nice and had a crispy outer layer and added the perfect texture to each bite.  The potato puree was a nice touch in every few bites.  I will say the vegetable medley was nothing to write home about but I imagine it is just for a pop of color on the plate.   She had the American Wagyu Rib Cap, per Oscar's recommendation, as he mentioned it had the flavor of a Rib Eye but the tenderness of a Filet, and he was so right.  The plate was gorgeous and the Rib Cap was definitely the star of the plate.  The exterior had a deliciously seasoned crust and the inside was perfectly tender and melted in our mouths.  \n\nWe also ordered two sides:  Mac and Cheese - honestly the best Mac and Cheese ever.  My fiancee hates peas so she was hesitant but she loved every bite.  The peas don't add a ton a flavor but they do add a nice pop of texture as you bite into them.  The Mexican Street Corn was our favorite site, the perfect amount of spice and cream, just perfect. \n\nDessert:  I know, how did we even manage to make it to dessert?! Trust me, it wasn't easy and we had to leave a little Mac and Cheese behind, but we had to take a small break and force ourselves to indulge in dessert.  Our plan was to share the Sticky Toffee Pudding, but I know Lava Cake is one of Ramsay's favorite desserts (mine too!), so I know he wouldn't put just a \"meh\" one on his menu.  I asked Oscar about it, and when he described it, I had to order it. So we each got our own dessert.  The Lava Cake is to die for.  There are 3 small lava cakes, each with farmer's market fresh strawberries, and homespun strawberry ice cream, and I am forever going to be disappointed with every other lava cake I have.  I am also a huge fan of chocolate covered strawberries, and this dessert was a perfect combo of the two.  She had the Sticky Toffee Pudding - it was incredible.  The cake was perfectly moist and delicious with the toffee drizzle Oscar poured on.  The brown butter ice cream was a delicious flavor that I've never had - it looks like a stick of butter, and the ice cream is a sweet buttery stick of deliciousness.  Note:  This dessert is pretty large and definitely enough for two. \n\nOverall, it was absolutely the most incredible meal I've ever had.  I loved every minute of it and the service was excellent!"

Friends enjoy Gordon Ramsay's TV shows, so I offered to take them to his restaurant while we were in Vegas on April 19. Seated right away (Reservation was at 8:45). Key may be to bring a young person who can't sit in the bar. Waiter Matthew could not have been more gracious. Even though the place was busy, he answered my Godson's questions as if he was an adult. Most of the food was delicious. Since it is expensive I suggest only trying what you can't get elsewhere. Steak was very good. Crab legs were cooked in butter; not just steamed like most places cook them. Best I ever had. We didn't order potatoes. I like them but they are overpriced here. Mac and cheese is strong. A little goes a long way. Asparagus was good but not great. Wouldn't order that again. Beef Wellington seemed over cooked but my friend didn't complain. Be selective. Just because it's on the menu doesn't mean you have to order it. Ask for Matthew's section. His dynamic personality made the evening very special for one 8 1/2 year old boy."

            "review": "Don't believe the hype. There was some truly memorable things about this meal, and some things that once you read this you will think twice about going.  Just to put this review into context my meal was $600 with tip and only two drinks for a party of 4. \n\nThe cocktails were good. You order off an iPad. The drinks were refreshing and well made. The beef tartare. Very cool presentation served in a smoke infused bowl. Only issue is that the texture was not creamy, and the taste was okay. The mixed green salads with green goddess dressing was good. Again not great. Just good.   Bread at the table was okay. 3 different types but a couple were dry. \n\nSo here where we start going down hill. Ordered the royal bone chop. The steak is $100 by itself. There is all this hype about Pat La Frieda picking the meat etc. The steak when delivered to the table was over cooked.  You could clearly see that the cut was sub par as it was very thin. Had to send it back. Yes the waiter took care of it, but that steak should have never been sent to the table. Was I picky yes. But if you call your self a steakhouse and are going to charge $100 per cut. It should be perfect.  My wife's was perfect. \n\nSides. The potato with b\u00e9chamel sauce was gross. Very sloppy. They literally poor the sauce over the potato. Corn was mushy as it was over cooked.  Mushrooms were fantastic. \n\nSo here is the nail in the coffin and why I will never go back.   If you are a total rewards member you get discounted prices on all food. At the beginning of the meal the waiter asks to see your card which I showed them after we ordered drinks. The bill comes and I give him my card again. I go ahead and also give him my CC as I do not typically look at food bills at restaurants. I get my credit card transaction back with a copy of the bill. And guess what the waiter did not do discount; the food after he charged me. Mistake?  Maybe. But he has seen my total rewards card twice. Then I ask him to reverse the charge, and give me a corrected bill. Said he could but it would take two days to come off my credit card. Okay every transaction I have ever had reversed for error they could do immediately. My bill ended up being $30 cheaper. I will let you make the decision. \n\nBottom line is that if you have been to a nice steakhouse this place will not blow you away. There is way too much hype, and the food is way too expensive. Sides are meh. I have had better steaks, and much better sides."

Our table got the tasting menu (you have you decide as a table) except one of our party has a gluten allergy. Not a self imposed gluten-free diet. A gluten allergy. And it was all but ignored. He was told to scrape the breading off of things, and just not to eat other things. All in all, I was disappointed that he had to pay the same price I did. Also, the food was average, not great, and the environment is loud and not befitting a fine meal. \n\nBottom line: Not worth it, go somewhere else."

All and all, good but not as good as last time.  Last time I had the new york strip and no desert.   Both times I have gone I could not get a table and had to sit at the bar, no biggie, I really like the breads, the strip on trip one - great fantastic,  The wellington on this trip, the pastry was soggy and quickly fell apart, and there was two 0.5 sq\" cubes of carrot and turnip - so when it says root vegetable and you are hungry get a side. The sticky toffee was great but man oh so filling and sweet.  All and all I was happy but like others I had high hopes, but you know Gordon  cant be everywhere.  Service and decor was great, people were very friendly,  all and all my meal was $120 I have paid more and got less but again had high hopes - the first time was better - at least my food wasnt RAWW!"

The bread selections as appetizer before your meal will get you started for a great meal and any steak is highly recommended. A classic staple is -of course - Gordon's Beef Wellington. My favorite, however, is the steak that just melts in my mouth: The Kobe knee cap.\n \nAs a dessert to finish your meal, you must try their sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream! \n\nI will definitely be back."

I loved that on the menu it stated how long the plate took to cook, everything tasted great from simple fries to the main entree. We didn't have a reservation but the host advised there was a lounge area available. I had my son and was a bit unsure if it would be appropriate to sit there but they allowed us to look before saying yes. It was 5 little dark tables by the main restaurant and bar, very convenient. More families where seated there throughout the my wait. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is I don't feel the restaurant was design for families, despite the fact we enjoyed our meal and there was other families there next to the lounge are we all seemed a bit uncomfortable. I get it is inside the casino and so are the other 2 Ramsay's restaurants. All 3 are very fancy and the tables are right next to each other, so even if they allow kids it doesn't give room for enjoyment. Loved the food and would definitely come back and pay $140 for 2 people!!"

Now, let me let you know why it is a must avoid.\n\nSteak-  Ordered Mid-Rare and that is how it was cooked.  However, the steak was tougher than Chuck Norris on Steroids.  \nSides-  Roasted Fingerling Potatoes.  These were good, but the fingerling does not roast as well as others.  And I hate purple potato used for roasting.(they look aweful)\n              Mac and Cheese.   Not much flavor here.  Very bland.\n              Fried Green Beans.   Theses were tasty.  A bit salty, but I like that.\n              Onion Soup.   Tasty.  Too small of a portion.\n              Shrimp Cocktail.  This was possibly the worst i've ever had.  No flavor and  \n              completely over-cooked.\n\nDrink-  Rusty Nail.  Bartender nailed this.  Pun intended.\n\nSide Note:  My girlfriend's cousin ordered a Ribeye Mid-Rare WITHOUT char and it came out looking like mine.....COVERED IN CHAR...\n\nAll in all.... Not a good experience.  The steak should have shined and it was no where close.\n\nSide Note 2:  The designer of the restaurant should be commended.  The interior was great."

I chose 2 cuts of steak.\n\nFirst I had a garden salad that I will not waste my time writing about and a British Ale Onion Soup.  This was the best French Onion Soup I ever had.  The ale made the soup very rich and delicious.  The cheese was perfectly melted and complimented the taste of the ale nicely.\n\nI had the 24oz Bone-In Ribeye.  This steak was cooked perfectly.  It had a perfect char on the outside and was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  the flavor and texture of this moist cut of meat was outstanding. I was told the steak was a Pat LeFrieda Steak.\n\nOur waiter recommended the American Rib Cap 8oz.  There was nothing wrong with this cut, but there was nothing special to it.  the bone in was better in my opinion.\n\nFor sides we had the Sauteed Spinach and Mac N Cheese.  They were ok.  \n\nI would go again to eat the Bone-In Ribeye."

Ready --- we all ordered fish. Additionally, the music was way too loud for us to hear not only ourselves trying to talk to one another but more importantly the waiter explain the steak or anything about the food, service or place to us. So, we just chose from the menu ourselves. Would we go there again? --- maybe --- with those suggested improvements."

This was a fine dining experience that cannot be missed. \n\nThe food was something dreams are made of. Amongst our group, we enjoyed the pacific salmon, the rib cut steak, prime rib, beef Wellington, and another cut of steak. They have about 10 options for steak! I had the mouth-watering salmon but everyone seemed to enjoy their selections. The side dishes we shared were the asparagus in a delicious cream sauce, the Mac and cheese(with truffle, bleu cheese and Parmesan), and the fingerling potatoes. All amazing. The desserts were good from what I tasted.  I only tried the sticky pudding and the coffee with the chocolate spoon to dip in it. \n\nThe sommelier was fantastic with the food and wine pairings. The cocktails were refreshing and strong. Be aware, they do charge for water though. \n\nThe service is in large part what you are paying for. You are treated as kings. Noel was our favorite.

I prejudged the restaurant, assuming it'd be unnecessarily expensive (correct) and overhyped/not that good (incorrect) given the celeb chef name attached to it (past experiences.)\n\nBiggest eye-roll moment: when our hostess pointed to the red light sculpture on the ceiling & proclaimed it represented GR's hand movements as he made his infamous beef wellington. Pretentious & laughable. \n\nOur booth was intimate, perfect for our almost 3-hour dinner. \n\nUpon getting settled in, we were given an iPad to help us choose our alcohol/cocktails. I opted for a glass of riesling on their wine list. \n\nI like the intriguing contrast between old school touches and modern detail; traditionally outstanding service, rolling out the meat cart, technology at our fingertips, EDM background music -- old meets new. \n\nFoods:\n-- bread selection was phenomenal. We commented how its uniqueness piqued our interest. The truffle bread & the blue cheese ones were particularly delicious, but can't complain about lemon rosemary brioche or bacon bread! \n-- creamed corn: sweet & strangely addictive\n-- baked potato: too many fancy toppings...smoked gouda sauce, GTF outta here! I would've preferred good ol' sour cream & chives.\n-- filet: butterflied, perfect temperature, generously seasoned, tender. Absolutely delicious, definitely in my top 5 favorite filets. \n\nBiggest eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-my-head moment: dessert. Sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream fashioned to look like a stick of butter. Mind equals blown. Describing it wouldn't do it justice. Suffice it to say, dinner here wouldn't be complete without an order. \n\nI still haven't seen any Gordon Ramsay shows, but I definitely know who he is now: a guy whose got almost 300 of our dollars, but who gave us a superb dining experience in return."

We stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel which unbeknownst to me was at the complete opposite end of the Strip.  My husband decided we should walk there to work up our appetites,  so 45 min later I was ready to bite anything and everyone!  It is located in the Paris Hotel in the middle of the Strip where the Eiffel Tower replica is situated.  \n\nWe were a bit early so they seated us in the bar area and said they would come to get us when the table was ready.  No number or little vibrating mechanism was given to us, so they must write down a description of you or something, because 10 minutes later the hostess came over and got us.  We were shown to our table and our servers appeared.  Yes, servers - one server and her assistant...I was impressed.  \n\nAfter perusing the menu and being shown models of the different cuts of meat (on a rolling cart), I chose the 7oz filet with baked potato on the side, my hubby chose the chicken.  The assistant brought us the bread plate to begin with 4 tasty types of bread.  DEElicious! Then the main courses came and we ooohed and aahhed with every bite! My filet was succulent and flavorful.  For dessert we split the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was divine.  I was too full to order my own dessert and not be able to finish it - especially at those prices.  In the end, we both agreed that this was one of the best (and most expensive) meals we have had in quite a long time and, like I said before, it was worth every penny!

Although the restaurant is fun, and they explain little things as they walk you to your table, they placed us in a dining area upstairs that took that fun ambience away, and makes it feel like any other stuffy steakhouse.\n\nYou choose your drink of choice from an iPad, but with 6 people, it takes awhile to get the menu around. The sauvignon blanc I chose was really tasty and fruity.\n\nThe display of meats they bring by on wheels was really cool, and I liked how they had mirrors above each slab of meat for you to see the cut up and close.\n\nMost of the table had decided on the famous beef wellington, and I was the only one that didn't choose to order an appetizer. The appetizers looked great, and everyone enjoyed it, from the foie gras to the lobster tail.\n\nExpect to be at this restaurant for awhile, as everything comes out 30 minutes after each other. The beef wellington also takes 45 minutes to cook. About 30 minutes after the appetizers, they brought out the bread. YAY! However, for 6 of us, they brought out 3 small pieces of 3 different kinds of breads. Foccacia, a brie and walnut bread, and another roll that was filled with mushrooms and truffle or proscuitto. The breads were divine, as I was starting to get hungry, and their butter was amazing! We devoured it, and about 30 minutes later, they asked if they wanted more. Hell yeah!\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, our entrees arrived. Decent presentation, but the beef wellington's plate looked a bit lonely. My friend and I shared the beef wellington for 2, which is about $3 cheaper than ordering it alone. The friend that ordered his own had a smaller piece, cut into two. Now, the beef is done medium rare, no choice, but his was overly cooked. Ours were cooked perfectly, but the pate was soooo salty! Like I felt as if I was getting a taste of the ocean with each bite. I tried to just eat the meat, as it was cooked perfectly, tender, and a waste of $50 if I didn't eat it! But very dissapointing. I ordered the mac and cheese as my side, and that was even worse. I did not enjoy it at all, but at $12, I ate as much as I could. The brussel sprouts were also overseasoned and overcooked as well. The baked potato was huge and cooked to perfection. That was probably the best side.\n\nOnly one pair of friends ordered dessert, and the toffee pudding and brown butter ice cream it came along with was excellent. Their french press coffee also came with 3 spoons with chocolate liquer, and it was very creative. The dessert definitley made up for the horrible entrees. Also, if it's your birthday, don't expect a free dessert here. Luckily, friends ordered for the birthday girl.\n\nOur waitress was Jessica and busser was Jessica as well. They were both great, but I feel our busser Jessica was more present, and made more of an effort to make the birthday girl happy. She also got to meet the winner, Christina, who was happy to take a picture with her.\n\nOverall, their apps and desserts looked/tasted great, but entrees are bleh. If I were to come back, I'd probably just order the rib eye, but definitley not the famous beef welilngton. What a let down!"

Christopher explained twice why we didn't want beef wellington for 2..so we each had our single portion. you can't make this at home! mac and cheese side dish was fabulous. you must save room for the sticky toffee pudding for dessert..we shared....almost puts you in a sugar induced coma. All this comes at a high price but we all left here happy. this is definitely NOT your fathers old stodgy steakhouse."

Had to seat myself down by the bar and wait nearly 15 minutes before any of the wait staff even came to me. Them had to wait another 15 minutes for my drink order. I realize it was busy when I arrived but still feel it was a bit too long for my drink. Only got checked on about twice during my entire 2 hours I stayed and felt the staff were paying more attention to the other guests. It's such a shame since I'm a big regular at Ramsey's other restaurants as a huge fan of his but I'm afraid I may not ever come back here again or recommend to my friends family and business associates."

My wrists wouldn't have to feel stressed out, slicing through the select cut."

Once we got sat though that was the end of it. The first thing you notice is the decor, all very nice with a giant English Flag painted on the roof. The music also seems to be most if not all English Bands. \n\nThe first thing we had was a cooked oyster appetizer, this was a very good start. Then we had our main dishes, my wife had a lamb dish that came with a rack of lamb, and a shepherds pie, the pie was really great. I had the beef wellington, this was amazing as well (this only comes cooked medium rare so be aware of that if you don't like your meat cooked this way). We also had a macaroni and cheese side, and that was fantastic. Finally for desert we shared a s'mores cheesecake, that was great, especially the marshmallow ice cream on top. \n\nThe waiters are great as well, all very attentive and nice, really the only down side of this place is the hostesses, which is surprising since they are the first contact with the potential customers. \n\nThis place is pretty pricey, but the quality of food is top notch. Not only that in a lot of places like this your dishes are really pretty small, this place though the portion sizes are pretty generous. So if you are looking for a nice place to eat with great food consider coming here. It does get fairly loud inside so this would not be the place to go for a quite dinner."

Everybody just looked so sharp in their uniforms. Loved it!\n\nWe started out at the bar and were immediately greeted with a welcoming smile. Idk why but it surprises me when a bartender in Vegas is super friendly off the bat. Especially a female one at that. Not to say they are all rude, but more nonchalant. \n\nAnyhow, I was feeling dirty...dirty martini that is and I always request blue-cheese olives if they are available. I was told they have an olive burger instead. It's an olive halved longways, stuffed with blue cheese, bacon, and a cocktail onion. Freakin' genius!! That one little piece of garnish made my night. I'm still in awe thinking about it.\n\nWhen we got to our table, our servers did a great job of explaining the menus, different cuts of meat and pointing out the signature dishes. I had the Beef Wellington which was very good but I can't help but compare it to another restaurant's version which set the bar really high for Beef Wellington. Had I had this version first, it would easily be my favorite. He had a seafood medley type of dish that I was actually getting pretty jealous of. He let me have a couple bites of the diver scallop and it was incredible. Perfectly seared with just the right amount of lemon cooked into it. The mac and cheese dish was outstanding as well. Lately, mac and cheese has been disappointing but this one was one of the best I've ever had. I almost forgot to mention, the bread was awesome, as well as the Kobe sliders we started out with. My only complaint was they were tiny. I could put the whole thing in my mouth in one bite--and no, not trying to brag here!\n\nWe finished off with coffee that came with flavored spoons. Amaretto, Baileys, and Chambord. Those were too cool. They were labeled ABC, respectively. We went for the sticky toffee pudding which was nothing short of excellent. Sticky, buttery, moist with a side of ice cream that was molded to look like a slab of butter. It was the perfect ending to our dinner."

            "review": "I went with my dad on our trip to Vegas on a Sunday night; we went Friday but the kitchen was closed by 11:15, so we just stuck around for a Pimm's Cup, which was fantastic and filled with fresh fruit.  It was definitely a sign of things to come.\n\nTwo nights later we arrived for our 9:45 reservations, and it was packed.  The bartender recognized us from a few nights before and got us drinks at the bar while they prepared our table.  Pimm's Cup again for me, it was good enough not to care what else may have been on their cocktail menu.\n\nFor those of you unsure about the d\u00e9cor, it was explained to me thusly: the entrance is the Chunnel, leading you from Paris to London.  There are pictures of the Chunnel throughout (in addition to some great shots of the Man Himself over in the corner) which completes the concept.  Also, the neon installation at the center of the ceiling is an approximation of Gordon's hands as he prepares the Beef Wellington.  I was kind of iffy about it on first glance, but the concept is cool, so points for that.  Also, a catchy if not somewhat out of place (for fine dining) playlist, but listening to Vampire Weekend and Stone Roses as I ate wasn't a turn off for me.\n\nMoving to the table, I figured wine was in due order, so I went with the Shiraz, which complimented the overall richness of the meal nicely.  I started with the onion soup, while my dad went with the iceberg wedge.  The onion soup was incredibly savoury, literally erupting with flavor.  Thank you, Gordon, I'll probably never enjoy onion soup again unless it's here.  It came complete with 2 pieces of what I can only assume was authentic-to-a-T Welsh rarebit, which added a nice thick, chewiness to an otherwise thin soup.  My dad's salad was excellent, but a bit too large for one person (considering what was to come).  The dressing (I don't remember what it was) had a nice bite, and the crispy pancetta on the side provided a nice salty contrast to the fresh greens.  In the midst, our bread selection arrived, and though none of the breads themselves were anything too spectacular, the imported Devonshire butter topped with black sea salt was incredibly good, and this likely ruined butter for me going forward.  If you're taking score, I'm likely no longer going to fux with Pimms Cups, onion soup, and butter from here forward.\n\nI can't remember if the meats cart came before of after the appetizer, but it's not like it matters.  The waiter did an excellent job of describing every piece of steak, and my only source of disappointment at this meal was the fact that I couldn't just try them all.  He demonstrated great knowledge of the cuts and their unique characteristics.  As an aside, I would label the service as \"alarmingly attentive\" in the fact that our waiter seemed legitimately concerned that we weren't having the absolute best dining experience of our recent memories, which we definitely were.\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I ordered the bone-in NY strip, medium, and my dad the Beef Wellington.  He made a joke upon ordering, asking if the waiter ever tried the Wellington from a bar in St. Louis, I think not fully realizing what he was in for.  This was the last joke he made of the night.  For sides, we ordered saut\u00e9ed spinach and truffled-out fingerling potatoes.  In the time waiting for our meal (surprisingly not long), we mused at the fact that we were the only ones not affixed to our iPhones.  Seriously, people, put the phones down and soak it in at some point.  And take your stupid beanie hats off indoors.  \n\nThe main course arrived in spectacular fashion, and I think both of us weren't really prepared to ruin the perfectly-sculpted pieces of meat in front of us.  The Wellington looked particularly impressive, but both were quite large portions.  My steak was tender and cooked to a perfect temperature; a nice crisp texture on the outside which gave way to a warm, pink inner.  My dad's looked just as perfect, and we both dug in after gawking at it all for a minute or two.  I knew immediately I wouldn't be able to finish it all after the first bite--the steak was so rich and juicy, and the sides were delicious and filling in their own right.  The spinach was a bit too buttery (if that's possible) near the bottom of the serving dish, and the potatoes were quite salty, but both provided a nice context to the wonderful, tender steak.  I tried the end of my dad's Wellington and it was beyond tender, almost as if it had been slow cooked for days.  The duxelles and p\u00e2t\u00e9 underneath the crust provided excellent complements to the rich beef flavor, and the savoury sauce on the plate rounded out an excellent dish.\n\nWe were both satiated to the fullest extent of the word, and while I'm a bit angry at myself for not ordering lighter and saving room for the sticky toffee dessert, but I don't feel like I missed out whatsoever.  We'll be back at some point to try everything we missed, and maybe next time we'll go all-in for the Tasting Menu.  5 stars."

They set the tone right by bringing out all the steak cuts on a Vegas-y mirrored display but nothing more beautiful than good beef.\n\nAs a starter, I went with the foie gras.  It was excellently prepared and an ample portion.\n\nI went with the rib eye cap, American Wagyu.  This is a cut I have been dying to try and it did not let me down.  Incredibly flavorful and I was surprised the 8 oz was enough.  Had asparagus as a side, also very good, liked the pesto preparation which made it interesting.\n\nAlso, wanted to comment on the bread plate.  I am not a bread person but this was incredible.  They gave me 5 different breads (not to choose between the 5 but all 5 were put on the table).  The breads were different from each other and very flavorful.\n\nAgain, a great steak experience."

It may be a little smaller than the 32oz steaks but trust me it's worth it. My wife got a bigger dry aged steak which, in its own right, was simply fantastic, but the rib cap is out of this world. \n\nWhen you first enter they take you through the \"Chunnel\" because you're leaving France (the Paris casino) and arriving in Britain. Kind of an interesting little gimmick they do. The hostesses all where interesting, if not wholly unflattering, getups that seem a little out of place but the rest of the wait staff are all appropriately and nicely dressed. \n\nOur server (Oliver) was so nice and so prompt and was spot on with his suggestions. The sommelier was great too. I'm not a wine drinker (my wife is though) but she (the sommelier) suggested the perfect wine to go with our meal. And even stopped by to explain a few things to us about the wine and just chat. \n\nI recommend the pork belly as a starter. I know I know, you hear pork belly and you're turned off. Don't be. It's fantastic and the grits it comes with are awesome and they make a perfect duo. \n\nYou, of course, have to try the toffee cake dessert. I don't remember the actual name but it's the most popular dessert so they will tell you about it. It's nice because it isn't too sweet or rich. Most desserts have a problem of being too sugar laden, this one does not. It's so delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere is not your typical top o' the line steak place but it's fun. The music is different, the vibe is different, and the aesthetic is definitely different. If you're looking for the stuffy \"old money\" steak place vibe, maybe go somewhere else. \n\nIn regards to the price it really is on par with other high end steak places, not just in Vegas but around the U.S. Living in Chicago I've had many great steaks and the prices here at GR Steak are on par with the good steak places in Chicago. If you're paying more for the celebrity name (as others have suggested) then you're actually getting a hell of a good deal here. \n\nOne other recommendation I have is to make reservations. If you don't you will be seated in a less fun area of the restaurant near the bar. Secondly, when making reservations make sure to ask to be seated in the main room or on the second floor. There's a back area that's kind of tucked away and you won't get the full atmosphere sitting back there. \n\nDefinitely will come back. Best food we've had in Vegas."

(We went to Spago once, and even with reservation we were made to wait for over an hours.) After that, everything just continued to be better and better. We are not stranger to fine dining, I would rate GRS on the top of the list. Taste is very important to us, but in my opinion, service is absolutely essential. Bad service will make great food tastes like sawdust. We have four course meal from the menu for each of us. We love every dish. And we didn't feel rushed or had to wait for our food. \nSo here are my ratings:\n\nService - Awesome! \nFood - Great. Must try the Beef Wellington.\nPlating- Great. Not just a chunk of steak on the plate.\nDessert - Awesome, toffee bread pudding is so good! You must have the coffee with it. I love the idea of three chocolate flavored liqueur for the coffee.\n\nOriginally I was going to give it a 4 stars, only because the ambience is a little loud for me.

Don't believe it's worth the value.\n\nMy husband and I double dated with another couple and our bill came out to about $800 (averaging $200 per person) - kind of a hefty price tag for steak, if you ask me.\n\nHOWEVER, what makes this place stand out amongst the others was how formal and how professional they presented everything. Right off the bat, after the hostess walked us into the restaurant, we were given a tour of the restaurant (gorgeous decor, by the way!) and seated upstairs in a quiet room. Our server - and assistant duo were also very friendly, attentive, and great with us. (forgot their names though, unfortunately).  They really wanted to help and I appreciate how their main goal was to focus on us.\n\nThey also did a presentation on a cart with all the different steaks, which helps clarify the different styles. I LOVED that!!!\n\nWe ended up each ordering a steak, some sides, and appetizers to start -- which included the bone marrow (yum!) and others which I can't remember on the top of my head. The bone marrow was rather delish -- never expected myself to like Bone marrow!\n\nAlso I thought it was professional that the \"drink\" menu was to be ordered on the iPad. I think that's very progressive thinking. Loved those parts of the restaurant and it makes it unique.\n\n\nOverall, my steak and food were good. Would recommend if you're ok with spending $200/per person easy and enjoy delicious food and service."

The place is pretty noisy with an open kitchen but was not too bad.  We looked over the menu and figured out what we wanted.  Then the waiter brought out a meat trolley with all of their cuts of meat.  He tried to persuade us toward some steak that is $35 and ounce (min 3 ounces).  We weren't interested.  We ordered our food, and again he tried to up-sell us.  I still ordered my standard rib-eye steak cooked medium rare. She ordered some seafood platter and asked for it all to be cooked well done.  Our food came out and my steak was medium at best and some of her fish was med-rare.  The steak was tough.  I seriously have had more tender steaks at a all you can eat buffet in The Colony, TX.

The bread arrived after we had finished our appetizers, with many apologies, but it spoiled the start of the meal. The mains and sides were very salty, to the point where we couldnt finish the potatoes and mac n cheese. The smores cheesecake to finish was good. Service was not special. We had to fill our own wine glasses throughout the meal. We ate at ramsays restaurant in new york last year, which was a totaly different experience.

I will summarize our experience while addressing some of the things I read in a few of the more critical reviews.  \n\nFirst of all, we did not have any difficulty reserving a table. We did not encounter busy signals, nor were we placed on hold either on the initial call, nor the call to confirm our reservation the day prior.  I will admit that the hostesses did seem a bit 'snobby' to me. When we arrived and said that we had a reservation, the girl held up a finger and said \"one minute\". No eye contact. The hostess that then walked us back to our table also seemed very cold and unfriendly. She was saying the right things, I guess , but didn't seem genuine and never made eye contact.\n\nWe did not find the music too loud. We were able to carry on a conversation without difficulty. Our waitstaff (Michael and Alexis) were phenomenal. I have to say that it has been a very long time since I was really blown away by the level of customer service I received somewhere. The communication between the waitstaff was phenomenal. They were courteous and attentive. I left wondering what I could change in my own office to make our clients leave feeling this great about the service that they receive. I cannot say enough good things about these 2, they were really wonderful. \n\nThe seating was comfortable. The tables were a comfortable distance apart. I thought that the flatware & dishes were elegant and smart. The food was fantastic. I had the Caesar Salad and the Beef Wellington. My partner had Braised Pork Belly. It was really wonderful. I wish we would have had room for more, but the portions were more than generous, and I was stuffed and couldn't finish the Wellington. \n\nI can't express strongly enough how fantastic this dining experience was. The food was incredibly delicious, the service was spectacular (and inspiring) and it is an experience I will always remember.  While I can't speak for other people on the waitstaff, I know that aside from the hostesses, I didn't see a single person leaning, lounging or shuffling their feet.  Everyone was in motion. Our glasses were NEVER empty (or even close to empty), a dirty plate or utensil was collected before I could scoot them away from myself. \n\nMy partner and I enjoyed Vegas, and our experience at Gordon Ramsey Steak is one of the main reasons we will be sure to return for another visit!! I can't wait to try something else on the menu. :)"

We ordered the Beef Wellington which was way too salty, seems like the chef got too excited about their volcanic salt. The A5 steak had great flavor but again, randomly too salty. Also, came across some really chewy tendony parts that I didn't enjoy so much. The staff was accommodatingand and provided a replacement steak but it was over cooked and dried on the ends, nice try and I appreciate the effort though. \n\nThe fois gras had pretty good flavor as well but I found the goat cheese to be a bit too overwhelming but I enjoyed the puff pastry it came with.\n\nThe bread platter in the beginning though, delicious! Easily one of the best breads and butter I've had, just go easy on the volcanic salt."

The flavor was there and it was cooked beautifully. For our entrees, I had the ribcap while the others in my party had the short ribs and a Kobe filet. The steaks were all cooked to the temperatures we liked and they were full of flavor. One of my guest had a loaded baked potato, while I shared potato puree with the other guest and I'm not kidding, that was the best potato puree I have ever had. I'd go back just to eat the potato puree. Our bill was about $340, that's with a tip and drinks. \n\nThe only negative I have is that the restaurant plays loud club music, but my waiter spoke so softly.

Well, I was happy to be proven wrong at Gordon Ramsay Steak.\n\nFirst, the prices are about the same as any other fine steakhouse on the Strip (granted, most of those are celeb chef joints as well).  But in light of the quality of the food, service, and experience, I thought GRS was actually pretty darn reasonable.  We started with the seared foie gras app, which I order almost everywhere it's offered.  The GRS version is a goat-cheese-stuffed popover and apricot sauce with the seared foie - altogether simply amazing.  Then we split the Beef Wellington for two (a bargain at just a hundred bucks), and after the first bite I understood why this is the GRS signature dish.  The duxelle, prosciutto, and puff pastry really enhance the flavor of the meat, which was the most tender tenderloin I've ever had (and I've eaten at a LOT of steakhouses).  We also split the asparagus side dish, totally fresh and yummy.  My dinner companion was slightly disappointed by the signature dessert, the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream, but I thought it was amazing, every bit as good as advertised.  I had the peanut butter chocolate crunch, which was drop-dead awesome (and I don't even like chocolate!).\n\nThe service was first-rate, always attentive, very well-informed (knew every detail of the menu like the back of their hand), and didn't even blink when I asked for a weird check split (I agreed to pay for the alcohol, my dinner companion paid for the food).  The only downer was that I didn't much care for the interior of the place.  I read about the Chunnel-themed entrance that cost an arm & a leg to build, but it didn't look nearly as cool as it did in photos.  I also thought the music was a bit loud; it made conversation a bit difficult.  But the food and service were so top-notch that those are minor quibbles.  I would definitely go back to Gordon Ramsay Steak again (and again)."

The fountains were still, tourists waiting with cameras for the show to begin. I was wearing a white Honolua shirt with tan Dockers and brown New Balances. I had just worked out and looked unbelievably sexy, so much so that I had almost cancelled dinner in favor of staying home to stare at myself in the mirror. But friends were in town from back East so my narcissism would have to wait. \n\nI crossed The Strip behind a sculpted Milfer, then swung left at Miracle Mile. It was a short jaunt from there and I strode in the side entrance of Paris Hotel/Casino. I winked at my reflection in a hallway mirror and hit the main room. Somewhat busy but not too bad, enough to have fun, not enough to feel smothered. I was early so I dropped a twenty in a Wheel of Fortune machine. I quickly doubled my money and cashed out. \n\nI toured the gaming area while searching for Gordon Ramsay. As I walked I passed Mon Ami Gabi, instantly remembering having eaten there years ago. Eventually, I spotted my destination and stopped at the greeting stand. Two nearly-as-hawt-as-me brunettes in skintight black attire plastic-smiled me and asked if I had a reservation. I said no, that I was meeting some people at the bar. They told me to go right in. I stud-muffined by another Robert Palmer Addicted To Love chickie dressed in black, deflecting her mannequin-like rictus with little damage. \n\nIt was dark inside the bar, and I slowly scanned the patrons. I hadn't seen these friends in nearly 20 years so I wasn't sure they had remained as attractive as I had; therefore, I was fearful of not recognizing them. But, alas, I need not have worried. They spotted me immediately and called me over.\n\nAfter the requisite hellos and how are yous and you look great nonsense, I sat between them and ordered a seven dollar Stone Pale Ale. We talked about people we knew, the old neighborhood, and our quickly aging selves. As we sipped our drinks I noticed a hairline crack in my glass. I mentioned it to our barman, but not until I had finished the ale. He sincerely apologized and gave me another beer on the house. As we rambled on we looked over the menu. \n\nMostly a steak and chop place, the average Gordon Ramsay entree looked to be around 50+ bucks. My companions had already stated that tonight's meal was on them, but I was never one to order something pricey when someone else was footing the bill. So I glossed over the more expensive items and went with a simple roasted chicken breast. My pal went with rib-eye and baked potato and his wife selected foie gras and caesar salad. The restaurant was pretty crowded so we decided to stay at the bar.\n\nThere were three bartenders at the counter. A blonde, a brunette and our man, Oscar. Oscar was the pleasant type, gracious and attentive throughout. When our food came he asked if our drinks were okay and then left us to our meal.\n\nMy chicken was a nice golden brown with some crispy skin on the side. It lay upon a bed of wet wild rice that I wish there had been more of. But the bird tasted good and I supplemented the poultry with a fine assortment of breads. I took a look at my buddy's steak and potato. Jesus Christ. That slab was shaped like the state of Montana and almost as thick as a Dostoevsky tome. And the spud? Honest to God it was the size of a football. He enjoyed both immensely as did his wife the liver and greens AND her new best friend beside her who turned out to be from our area back east. Her new bestie was a veterinarian, in town for a convention. \n\nAnyway, we chatted a bit more about good times and bad. More of the former than the latter, but neither of less importance. When the bill came my chum grabbed it immediately, charging it to his room. I asked if he needed any money, if I could please leave the tip. He waved me off. \n\nWe stood to depart and gathered outside. Slot machines rang and whistled as we said our goodbyes. I wished them well on the remainder of their cross-country trip and headed for the exit. As I hit The Strip I wondered to myself if I should not perhaps return to Gordon Ramsay one day. Foot the bill on my own and get a fat slice of beef with a double Scotch.\n\nI smiled as desert wind and tourist cologne whisked through my hair, now longer than it had ever been. \n\n\"Yes,\" I whispered aloud as I walked with strangers in the night, \"that sounds like the most wonderful of ideas.\""

Actually, I got over $200 worth of \"meh\" for 1 person.\n\nI ate here on August 8, 2015, and started with the British Ale Onion Soup. It had a decent flavor, but was a thick, gelatinous consistency that was odd and unenjoyable. It actually stood up on my spoon more like a pudding than a soup. For my main course I was really looking forward to the Beef Wellington. But it just... was. It was cooked perfectly, but was amazingly flavorless. It was effectively unseasoned. I am actually not sure how it is even possible to cook a steak and make it taste like nothing. My best way to describe the Wellington is with two words. Boring. Bland.  \n\nI also had the Mac & Cheese side dish. I've never had truffles, so didn't know what to expect. But I guess truffles taste like burnt garlic. And so much burnt garlic that was so hot it was hard to eat.\n\nI tried to finish with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Again, I really wanted to like it. The cake was dense and grainy, and the toffee flavor was overpowering. It was SOOO sweet that after 3 bites I just thought I was going to lose my supper in the middle of the restaurant. \n\nSo all in all, pretty disappointing that the best part of my dinner was the plate of breads I had before my soup. \n\nOn the good side, the perfect martini was good, and the 1/2 bottle of wine (I forget which one) was excellent and felt like good value. And service was flawless. The waitress also removed the Toffee pudding from my bill when I told her it was inedible. \n\nIn the end, I have had many many meals I enjoyed more for $190 less."

Yep, I went to a fancy Las Vegas restaurant alone.\n\n$60 for a 24 oz bone-in ribeye seemed like a pretty good deal considering this was a $$$$ restaurant and with Gordon Ramsey's name behind it. I make a lot of steak at home but I almost never eat it when going out, felt like it was about time I tried an expensive steak at a gourmet restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has a nightclub vibe with dim lighting and loud music. Just like in Gordon Ramsey's BurGR restaurant, the waitresses are dressed in provocative short dresses in true Vegas fashion. Gordon you animal.\n\nUpon placing my order, I was greeted with one of the fanciest bread plates I had ever seen, with volcanic sea salt butter on the side. Who needs an appetizer when you can have a bread plate like that. Absolutely amazing.\n\nAs you'd expect from a 24 oz ribeye, it was massive. There were two girls at the table next to me who also ordered the ribeye, but asked the waitress to change their order once they saw how huge my steak was. The ribeye had a perfectly charred curst and a juicy soft interior, a real pleasure to consume. About halfway through, my mouth had gotten used to the flavor so I asked for some salt. To my pleasant surprise the waitress brought me a small plate of the delicious volcanic sea salt, with a small spoon so I could scoop a tiny sprinkle of the salt into every bite. That really sealed the deal for me, I'd definitely recommend asking for the sea salt to anyone eating here.\n\nThe final bill came up to about $75 after tax and tip. After dinner I played some more black jack and won another $45 to break even."

When you go to a high end restaurant and are paying hundred of dollars for a meal, you have certain expectations. You expect the food description to be accurate and list any allergens, especially nuts because it's an extremely common, and at times deadly, allergy. The dish had what looked like walnuts in it. Luckily, I didn't ingest it and was able to spit it out in time. We were also not happy that we had to pay for water. We were only offered still water or sparkling water. We assumed the still water was regular free water, but it came in a bottle and we were charged $9.  I felt that it was very sneaky of them and not right.  We're spending all this money and they can't even offer us free water? Do they really need our  $9!? As for the food, it was delicious,  but this place is not worth the price tag.

When we asked on the phone if we needed a confirmation number, the girl on the phone said that it was not necessary.  Fast forward two months later to last week.  We show up at the restaurant on time.  Three people are standing behind the podium.  Two are talking on the phone (I assume taking reservations) and one girl is just staring out into space.  After a while, the girl finally acknowledges us and goes into the computer to find our reservation.  Surprise.....she can't find it.  They question when and how we made our reservation and we told them.  They repeated they just couldn't find it.  Had we not pressed, they seemed ready to turn us away at this point.  They finally agreed that they were running 15 minutes behind and they could seat us in 15 minutes.  Okay, fine.  As we enter the bar area, we take notice of two other couples who come in after us.  Twenty minutes later, the first couple is seated.  Thirty five minutes later, the second couple is seated.  We go back up to the podium to question what was going on.  The dark haired girl behind the podium shuffled some papers and said they were working on our table.  I told her it was unacceptable of a restaurant of this caliber to lose a reservation and then seat people who came in after us.  She then insinuated that we never made a reservation at all and that the restaurant \"does not lose reservations.\"  Not one ounce of remorse or correction of this error was made on the part of the restaurant.  By this time, our entire experience was sullied and we had no desire to eat there anymore due to the snooty attitude of the staff.  We went to Tender at the Luxor instead...a much cheaper restaurant but one that displayed EXCELLENT customer service.  Horrible customer service all around."

We started with the ravolio, had the beef wellington for 2 and a side of the mac and cheese. (We also had 2 beers) It was wonderful! Best meal of the week! It was everything I was hoping for in having the famous beef wellington! It was cooked perfectly! The environment was energetic and well themed/styled to what I would think Ramsay's taste to be. Next trip to LV I hope to visit his other restaurants too.\n\nHowever, and take the following with a grain of salt because it is LasVegas, but the showmanship of the hostess and servers was too over the top. As the host walked in groups of customers she stopped and pointed out that the neons above mimiced Gordon's hands as he was working the pass. Cool fact, if it's even true, but odd that she would stop them right in the middle of a congested area to point this out? Our server was a bit full of himself/over confident. He presented us with a special Hell's Kitchen menu (which features items like risotto that you can't get on the regular menu and is over priced compared to the regular menu), walked away and took FOREVER to bring back a regular menu when we had clearly closed the specialty menu and was looking for a regular menu. He gave us the option of sparkling or still water - no tap (I know, I know ... Yuck TAP!) So right off the bat we felt like he was only presenting us with the expensive options. I get up selling - but again, he did this in a very arrogant manner. I felt like he was eyeing us like an easy target.\n\nAlso plan on spending at least 2 hours there. It seemed like there are soooo many touch bases (being greeted by the host, given the host speech, being sat, being greeted by your server, their whole intro speech, the different menus, the meat trolly, ordering, paying, etc.) It seemed like there was 10 min between each touch base! I understand it is meant to be an experience, but both couples around us - and us included had somewhere to be after."

Read on for the long version.\n\nI've been to a lot of fine dining at the major hotel casinos in this town.  One of the cornerstones of the fine dining experience, in my opinion, is that you do what you can to accommodate the customer.  Well this is not the case at Gordon Ramsey Steak.  At this place, the snobbish attitude is that you will take what's on the menu and you will like it.\n \nIt was a special occasion dinner, but we were never asked as such.  But that's okay.  We were sat in an area apart from the main dining room (so the view was not as good -- a bit more claustrophobic and it sort of felt like we were being segregated away from the \"real\" customers and put into the \"cheap seats\").  What we arrived about an hour past opening, so whatever.  Waiter seemed to take forever to get around the steak presentation and ordering, but such a delay was the least of the problem (although in hindsight, it may have been a red flag).\n\nSkip ahead to the food ordering where the night went downhill.  Wife does not like fish, but was interested in a seafood dish on the menu that listed four seafood items, one of which was fish.  We asked the waiter if it was possible to switch out the fish with shrimp.  His immediate response was that that chef doesn't like to accommodate substitutes -- and making some comment about food costs.  So without even giving us a courtesy of pretending like he went to ask the chef, he said it couldn't be done.  He then tried to direct us to other a la carte items on the menu, but the lack of accommodation combined with his snotty attitude left a very poor impression.  When I ordered my steak, I asked for Medium Well (and then added Medium Well Plus, because I have often found in my experiences that when I ask for a steak medium well, it come out very much medium because the steaks are so thick -- and so I thought I would emphasize to the waiter and hopefully the cooking staff that I would like to make sure it's more on the medium well side for the entire steak by saying Medium Well Plus). I wasn't trying to do anything more --- and yet our snooty waiter, the moment I said Medium Well Plus gave me a look and said \"We can't really do that.\"  After seeing how my wife had been treated in her order and knowing how much it had pissed her off, I laughed out loud when the waiter decided to double down with his snooty response to my request.  He went away, but at this point, we contemplated just getting up and leaving.  Spoke to management and were moved to a different table.  New waiter was better, but there wasn't much more for the waiter to do and the damage had already been done.   The one bright spot is that we complained to management and they did take steps to accommodate us (and also providing a better explanation than the snooty waiter for why the chef could not accommodate the request we made earlier).  A clear case of poor customer service management on the part of the waiter.  \n\nAs for the food, well you would expect the steak to be great at a place called Steak with a $62 price tag. And indeed, it was a good steak, but I would not say it was anymore amazing then what I've encountered at so many other steak places in town.  So in that respect, it was just okay.  My wife's entree consisted of a single small lobster tail.   No sides by either of us (given that we almost left after ordering entrees, you can understand why we chose not to order any sides at that point).  The complimentary bread was good, but I felt it took them to long to bring it out.\n\nWe had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert.  And that was probably the highlight of the entire evening.  It salvaged the overall bad experience somewhat, but it was still not much of a conciliation.  I would recommend that the management make the \"stick\" of ice cream a little bit bigger to match the portion size of the pudding.\n\nI know this review isn't going to have any impact whatsoever on people continuing to dine with Gordon Ramsay -- this type of restaurant is the type people go to regardless of a negative Yelp reviews (and probably overshadowed by the hundreds of other \"glowing\" reviews by diners who feel obligated to give a glowing review of such establishments in order to justify the outrageous amount of money spent on such dining).  But I wanted there to be at least one review out that that calls this place out for what it really is -- another affront for bourgeois snobbery in a town that sadly has too much of that around these days.  Too many fine dining diners go to these restaurants and think they have had an amazing dining experience just because of the ambiance, presentation of the food on the plate and the final bill price. I'm here to say that it takes more than just fancy presentation and overpriced entrees to make a restaurant a truly fine dining experience."

The interior of the place was screaming for renovations (and yet I'm told this is a relatively new restaurant) the menu, large and very confusing, the staff, poorly trained and extremely unknowledgeable.

If you plan on coming here make sure you have a reservation for a seat in the restaurant or else you'll be looking for a seat at the bar area, which might be hard to do. We got lucky and found a nice seat at the bar and were greeted right away by the bartender Tracy. She completely made us feel very welcome and didn't judge us despite our young appearance, which was a concern for me. \n\nThe restaurant was ultra modern and very edgy. This is the most edgy steakhouse I've ever been in because of the loud music and dim red lighting. Also, the uniforms for the staff was congruent with the ambiance of the restaurant, which is expected from Chef Ramsay.\n\nMy date had the Beef Wellington for 1 and I had the short ribs. Both dishes were amazing and worth the money to try them at least one time in your life. Lol. The amazing thing is that when the dishes were brought out, the staff described the components of the dish again, which was even more detailed than the menu. So, this was a plus because I've never experienced that before. It was a very nice and fancy touch to the experience. \n\nI highly recommend dining here...it's a Vegas must!"

My husband had the Caesar salad - the scotch egg was a new experience for him (the server teased him into trying it - breakfast in a bite!). I had the beef Wellington. It was very good, if a bit salty in some bites. My husband got the American wagyu filet. He said it was excellent. We also got the asparagus (done right!) and the loaded baked potato (that thing was HUGE). For dessert, we chose to share the sticky toffee pudding along with our cappuccinos. I wish I had been able to eat more of it. Definitely a great end to a fantastic meal."

Ramsay stressed the importance of \"tasting the beef\". That might be the case here.

We were offered an iPad of drinks that are designed to cleanse the palate!  Yummy and refreshing!  Then came time to start ordering!

But the dinner experience I had at GRS was nothing short of underwhelming. \n\nI had been dying to check out this restaurant, so when a friend suggested a trip to Vegas, I was completely on board. \n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the main lobster and decided to share. Boy, was that a mistake. While the lobster was good, the portion was absolutely miniscule and in anticipation of a big expensive meal, had practically starved ourselves all day. Moving on. \n\nFor a main course, I ordered the Beef Wellington ('cause obviously I had to). My husband got the epic American Kobe filet. The waiter does come by with a meat cart before you order so you can see the different cuts, which is a nice touch. We also ordered the mac and cheese, haricot vert, and asparagus as sides to share.  \n\nMy Beef Wellington? It was fine. Okay. Pretty good. When compared with the amazingness I was expecting (and the price point), \"fine\" isn't anywhere close to good enough. We got a bearnaise to go along with the Kobe steak, but the fact is, that was its saving grace. The steak itself was incredibly boring. Sure, it was pretty good. It was fine. Not bad. But.... this is a steakhouse. And that's a $75 steak. Seriously? Not good enough, my friend. \n\nOn the other hand--- the sides. Oh my God. OH MY GOD. The mac and cheese was incredible, and I think I could have eaten two buckets of the tempura fried haricot vert. The asparagus was perfect, too. So for that bit of wonderfulness, I'm giving Gordon Ramsay Steak one star for each of those. When I start craving mac and cheese, that's the one I think of. So, so good. \n\nBut guys.... it's a steakhouse. A STEAKHOUSE. With a super boring steak. Yes, it was well cooked. But I've had far better steaks at restaurants one would assume would be inferior. Overall, the meal was a lot of highs and lows. I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, since it's one of my favorite things on the planet, but I was really tempted to not order anything else. The toffee pudding I would say was quite good-- 4 out of 5 stars. I really wanted this to be the best meal of my life. It was certainly the most expensive (one appetizer, two entrees, three sides, one dessert, and the least expensive bottle of wine on the menu -- $300). But I refuse to get caught up in the I-paid-a-lot-for-this-so-it-better-be-five-stars trap and be completely honest. \n\nIf you feel you must go to Gordon Ramsay Steak... just order the sides."

Apparently, she hops between the 3 GR restaurants in vegas (burger, steak, pub & grill) so we gotta be lucky to catch her.\n\n2) We ordered the maine lobster and foie gras appetiser. Both were beautifully cooked and we absolutely loved it. The foie gras is a must order! (ok unless you're one of the anti foie gras activitists)\n\n3) The entrees were extremely disappointing. We ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye and the signature roasted beef wellington, both in medium rare. The rib eye was way overcooked, and it was served more like medium well than medium rare. Also, we didnt find it to be very well cooked or had anything special. No sauce, nothing. Just take a piece of steak and grill it. I could probably do that on my own.\n\nThe beef wellington was slightly disappointing. Not to say that it wasnt perfectly cooked - it sure was. But given all the hype and expectations about it built from watching Hells Kitchen, it just didn't wow us. I guess it is one of those dishes that feels more like an accomplishment to cook perfectly but not as much to taste.\n\n4) We were pretty full from the less than stellar entrees, but still had to make room for dessert after all the raving reviews about the Sticky Toffee Pudding. We were definitely not disappointed. This dessert is definitely a must try.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here for the apps and desserts, but definitely not for the entree. I'm giving this a 3 stars because as a steak house, they really failed at the steak."

The taste was good for the first 2-3 bits but then it just got bland). It didn't take 90minutes to prepare like another review had mentioned though. It was much sooner... sorry I can't tell you exactly how long it actually took since we weren't paying attention to the time while devouring the delicious bread plate that they gave us while we were waiting. \n\nThe husband ordered the american rib cap (delicious!!! definitely a winner)\nSides: satueed spinach (salty salty salty) and mac and cheese (best seller our waiter saids....don't understand why...very underwhelming). \nalso ordereed the bone marrow to accompany our beef dishes (all I tasted was the salt that was layered on the top which made the fattiness of the marrow overbearing--yuk! )\n\nI ordered the HK Antiooxidant which was delicious but so not worth it for $14 (half a small rounded cup FILLED with ice, you can sip it up in 2-3 sips). Thank goodness the hubby was able to reproduce it at home.  \n\nService was quick and attentive (reservation was at 5pm though when they just opened) but the music was so loud we could bearly hear what our waiter was saying. We were done by dinner a little over 6pm. Bill $188 (including tax, excluding tips). We were full at least. \n\nOverall, a nice experience. We're glad we explored what the hype was all about. But unfortunately, it didn't wow us enough to come back, considering there are so many steak houses in LV to try."

I am only doing a review now as I did not have a Yelp account then. Our reservation was a Sunday night at 5:15pm. We had friends in town who really wanted to try the restaurant. \n\nJust a side note you have to book reservations well in advance.  This place is very popular and very busy.  We usually book a week in advance to be safe. Sometimes you can get lucky though and get a same day reservation. The staff is very professional and friendly. Out of curiosity we asked when the last time Chef Ramsay had been to this location and turns out he was there 4 days prior. \n\nTo start the meal, they give you a nice assortment of breads.  As a starter the English Chowder soup is a must try if you are a soup fan. For the main course the signature house dish of Beef Wellington is even better than you think. I haven't really tasted anything else like it. It literally melts in your mouth and comes with a small potato puree and vegetable side.  I think the only thing I don't like is the Mac N Cheese. It has a very unique taste i think due to the truffles used in it is what I heard. 3 out of 4 people at our table were not fans but it is still a popular side.  If you save room for dessert I recommend sharing a Sticky Toffee Pudding with another person. It is pretty rich but I can't think of a better dessert I have had anywhere else.  Next time I visit I am going to try the Wagyu American Rib Cap as it is the 2nd most recommend item not the menu outside of Beef Wellington. \n\nThe only down side besides the Mac N Cheese is when the check comes! You get what you pay for! It is not a cheap restaurant by any means, but then again the quality is great all the way around. I would definitely recommend it for special occasions type of place unless you are rich :)"

As soon as we sat down our waiter welcomed us and presented us with the menus and bread selection.\n\nThe bread was dry, cold and hard... I had one bite of each and couldn't believe how gross it was. I would have probably preferred the bread at Olive Garden to this place. The butter came out of a container and was sprinkled way too heavily with Sea Salt Crystals. LARGE Sea Salt Crystals. The first complaint was that the bread was cold and hard so he took it back and gave us another set of hard, dry bread but at least it was luke-warm. \n\nFor an appetizer we wanted to try the Potato Yolky but when it arrived there were more Cherry Tomatoes than Yolky! The tomatoes were not ripe and still yellow in some places  but, since they were grilled whole it was edible... I assume. The appetizer was around $30 and relatively small.\n\nMy Dad ordered the Beef Wellington and I ordered the Eggplant Wellington. The Wellingtons were cooked to perfection however they had no taste at all and my eggplant was NOT cooked all the way. The waiter came back and asked us how everything was and I told him that the eggplant was not cooked all the way and it had hardly any taste. To my dismay his reply was, \"To each his or her own,\" and walked off. \n\nSince this is a 5-Star restaurant I assumed that there would be salt and pepper shakers on the table but to no avail there were none. I asked for them in advance but our waiter never replied. \n\nThe only reason this place gets a 3 is because of the dessert. I should of ordered two but since the food was meager at best we shared the Sticky Toffee Date Cake... Unbelievably delicious! We both were informed that Sticky Toffee Date Cake received an award and I agree 100 percent. \n\nBesides the music being too loud, waiters being rude, dry bread, over-priced food and not having many healthy, fit or vegetarian options the dessert is good and yes, they have wine and that makes anything tasty. \n\nMy Dad and I were highly disappointed with the taste and service and I will NOT be return customers. \n\nIf you decide to come to this place then order dessert and wine. The final bill was $300 (included tip). Not a good place for a date but okay idea to take family. Not kid friendly and I had to get a snack an hour later because I was still starving!"

The \"loaded\" baked potato side was far from loaded with 2 chunks of stringy nearly inedible bacon. While the drinks were good at $15 a pop you can spend more on those than a family of 5 spends on groceries for the week.

They made our visit here top notch and truly special with their attentive attitude and pleasant service. \n\nBy recommendation of my server Dennis, I tried the strawberry martini and thought it was delicious. My husband tried the bottled passion fruit green tea ice tea since he was not looking to have alcohol and he really enjoyed it; I soon after ended up ordering the black sage ice tea for myself and it was just as enjoyable to me too. Supposedly, the ice tea is not sweetened but it's so flavorful you really don't need to add any sugar to it. For dinner my husband ordered the the Foie Gras appetizer which he loved. I had the rib-eye steak cooked medium-well with the side of mac and cheese and was very satisfied. \n\nDesserts: well, all I can say is it was a joyful experience. You must try the toffee pudding if you're looking for a mesmerizing sweet escapade. If you live for desserts as much as I do, I am warning you, please do not forsake this treat. We ordered one for each of us and do not regret it. Now go, ENJOY!"

The Eurostar is just beginning to move.  Things get noisy as acceleration increases and then it levels out.  Your trip is underway, under the sea and under the ground.\n\nFrom the galley, a steak cart is wheeled out toward your seat.  Eyes dart from newspapers to the nine(?) raw cuts of meat, each individually displayed on its own stand with tiny mirrors revealing the deep red and intricate marbling of each steak's obverse.  Instead of the steak, you choose a double pork chop.  Your neighbor asks, \"What do you do with that meat on the cart at the end of the night?\"  The waiter replies, \"We throw it away.\"  Rule: Never get the display model of anything.\n\nNext is the surprise.  You didn't order any tasting breads, but they've arrived anyway courtesy of an African waiter named Muhammed.  There are four types.  These breads are succulent and daring.  You would grovel to them if breads were superior to humans on the food chain.  Muhammed asks if you would like more and you say yes and point out your favorite two.\n\nThe appetizers are next, a raviolo and a chorizo-stuffed lobster tail.  Inside the raviolo is an egg, which proves that the chicken did not come before the egg.  1. Ravioli, 2. Egg, 3. Chicken.  This question is now settled for all future generations.\n\nBy the time the pork chop's arrived, you've nearly begged Muhammed to bring you more bread.  The chop is thick and juicy and cooked medium.  A short, thin bone sticks out the rear, pointing at the person sitting across from you.  He didn't order the GRS with his Chunnel ticket and you can tell by his smug, nasty look that he is regretting it.  The chop is cooked like its brother the steak, charred on the outside and drizzled in a delicious dark sauce.  You remember that incredible, brined pork chop you had only a month ago that you thought was the apex of cooked pig.  You stand corrected.  It is okay to be wrong sometimes.\n\nWhen you arrive in France a few hours later, you are dead.  What?  Yes, you have been executed.  It turns out you are a criminal and that was your last meal.  As your soul descends or ascends to its final resting place, you seemed shocked-shocked, but satisfied.  As you say your goodbyes, Muhammed hands you one more piece of bread in what looks like a reenactment of the Creation of Adam.\n\nGoodbye cruel, delicious world."

The bone in rib eye was also crazy good! The mac n cheese is also crazy good!\n\nWhile Gordon wasn't there while I was having dinner, Chef Andy (female) from the show Hell's Kitchen was there. She was a sweetheart and came over to the table to check in and take a picture.\n\nWill be back for sure!"

While the hostesses are dressed in all-black, which will give you a Robert Palmer flashback, the restaurant is very relaxing and breathes comfort ability.  \nThe wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and menu. I also liked their outfits (style and color scheme).\nThe swordfish was an excellent choice for dinner.  The portion was a little smaller than other places, but it was cooked and crafted excellently by the chef.\nWhile in Las Vegas, a visit to Gordon Ramsey's Steak would be recommended. \n\nThe only negatives could be the prices, too many servers waiting on you and the music was a little louder then normal.   It can get confusing at times who you should be asking for service.  Janelle was our server.  Very good server, but she spent more time focusing on my boss then me and my order.  But wouldn't recommend requesting someone else.  She doesn't hurt the experience."

We had gnocchi, pork belly to start, I had the bone in rib eye and my wife had the fishermans grill per the recommendation of our server Donnie. For sides we had potato puree and fingerling potatoes. Everything was great, I thought the highlight dish was the fingerlings, had just the right amount of parmesan and the truffle was right on not overpowering, everything blended well together. But the service (server Donnie) was over the top. Great job Donnie !!! Highly recommended !!!"

Had a special scallop risotto which was supposed to be topped with truffles from France but was told they ran out of them and they substituted it with 2 large scallops for $60 !!! Cost just as much as a steak! Truly disappointed! 2. After spending over $250 for drinks and dinner, they are too cheap to give you a free birthday dessert! Just had to try what they were known for and the Sticky toffee pudding was delicious but would hope they would comp it! Best they could do was give me a candle with it and say HB! 3, Had to try all kinds of food there so had leftovers BUT get this, they ran out of large take out bags so they placed all my leftovers in nice container but places them vertically! I had three small bags and all my food was not so appealing as it slid down the container!  Gordon Ramsay is tough on TV BUT sure didn't ensure this experience was perfect for his own customers!"

I was an invited guest of the casino, having dinner with employees of the casino, AND having the meal (along with my flight and stay) paid for by the casino. If we received any special treatment at Gordon Ramsay's, I shudder at the thought of the treatment of the average customer.\n\nThe food, as everyone else says, is great. Sticky toffee pudding, beef wellington etc all wonderful. There's not much to add here.\n\nThe service is some of the worst service I've received, in any restaurant, anywhere. To receive this level of service in a fine dining restaurant is a travesty. It took us an HOUR AND A HALF from our seated time to be served bread. \n\nThe main reason for the one star is the spectacular handling of a terrible situation by our waiter, Dennis. After ordering (he neglected to ask), I told him I had a shellfish allergy. He said my order should be fine. My beef tortellini had some small pieces of fish next to it, so, I, assuming the best, took a bite. It tasted like scallops. When DENNIS came on by, I asked him what it was. The conversation follows:\n\nDennis: \"Oh yes, those are scallops.\"\nMe: \"...I have a shellfish allergy. I told you I have a shellfish allergy.\"\nDennis: \"Well, just don't eat them.\"\nMe: \"It doesn't matter. I already did. They're right next to each other and I told you about it.\"\nDennis: \"Oh, it wasn't cooked with it. You should be fine. Just don't eat it.\"\n\nand walked away.\n\nThankfully, my allergy is mild and only makes me nauseous. I wasn't paying for the meal or I would've made a gigantic scene. No apologies were offered. In fact, that was the last we heard of it."

BTW, my favorite steak place in Las Vegas is at Wynn Hotel, and that is SW Steakhouse, so I'm comparing it to SW, which is the gold standard for me. But I was staying at the other end of the Strip, and wanted to walk to dinner. So I tried Gordon R. The martini was a less generous pour than SW. The bread was good, but not as interesting or tasty as SW. The NY Strip steak was good, but I asked for pink (and said it twice when ordering), but it came out more well-done than pink. The waitress did not ask if I was happy, and I was too hungry to send it back. It still tasted good.\nIt surprised me that if you want a sauce, they charge $7 for a bit of sauce! That is sort of insulting in my opinion. The side of creamed spinach was good, but nothing really exceptional.\nSo, in summary, an expensive meal that was definitely good, but did not compare to my experiences at SW. Take a cab to Wynn! Oh, also, the music is so loud you cannot talk to anyone."

First,  I want to say the steaks were amazing and your desserts were to die for( the desserts were free because what had happened).  The waitress who waited on us  was knowledgeable on the steaks  and she knew which beer would go with the dishes. \n\n   The dinner would have been GREAT, expect for the host who showed us to our table. She took us up in the elevator  to the second level then we walked across the floor.  She then walked us back to the elevator and told us to wait in front of the elevator.  After 2 minutes standing there, she came back and took us down stairs to our table. \n\n   Mr. Ramsay,  please understand, if I was at a 1 star or 2 stars restaurant I can understand about the miscommunication about where to seat your customers.  I was disappointed and sad for what happened on our special night. My wife and I were looking forward to your 5 stars restaurant but it fell short to our expectation.  I paid $615.65 for 3 people so I think I have the right to expect GREAT service ALL around service. Don't you think?\n\n   I know you are a world class chef: restaurateur and television personality, awarded 15 Michelin stars in total and currently holds 14. Maybe you should slow down and check up on your restaurants... \n\n#1 - first impression is the front desk...\n#2 - second is the table...\n#3 - the food and service..."

How I wanted to love your restaurant and rave about it, but my experience was blah.\n\nSo, my coworker made last minute reservations which were easy enough, and we arrived early so we could have appetizers and drinks at the bar.  The bar service was excellent, and we kinda wished we would've had our entire meal at the bar.  Our bartender was extremely helpful and explained the drinks and recommended her favorite apps.  I ended up having the ravioli and my friend had the foie gras, both were very good.  \n\nOnce seated for dinner, our waitress was less than thrilled that we weren't  going to be having drinks or apps.  We ordered our mains right away; I had the halibut and my friend had the seafood trio.  We both were underwhelmed.  My halibut was under seasoned and tasteless and from what I remember my friends entree tasted pretty good BUT the seafood looked miniature sized, the clams were puny, and everything looked sad =(. The bread and water was the best part of the dinner portion of our meal.  \n\nOur food took entirely too long (nearly 50 minutes), and about a half an hour of that, our waitress was  nowhere to be found.  We had to flag down some bouncer looking guy (manager?) to inquire about our food, and then at the end our bill took long.  It didn't end there, my credit card was charged double, but that was sorted out later. \n\nI'll return (by force) ONLY because my bf is dying to try this restaurant, I hope that my experience is better the second time around...too bad I won't be excited about it =\\"

I had to save the rest of it for after my dinner so I could savor it!! \n\nBeef Wellington - Cooked perfectly! it was medium rare, just how I like it, and the pastry on the outside was made just right.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding - What a great way to end the perfect meal! The sticky toffee paired so well with the butter ice cream! I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but I really enjoyed this dessert! \n\nI had some friends that went the previous day and they recommended the bone marrow, pork belly and foie gras.

We got the Maine lobster as an appetizer. The lobster was excellent, very unique. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't order Gordon Ramsay's \n beef Wellington and I'm glad I did!!  The Wellington was cooked perfectly, you could cut the filet with a fork ( not kidding ) it came with veggies and mashed potatoes in a glaze sauce. For desert we got the sticky toffee pudding. It was the perfect way to end the meal.  I'm definitely making this place a regular stop when in Vegas!"

            "review": "Extremely disappointed with our experience.  Booked a reservation weeks ago and couldn't wait to try GR's new restaurant in vegas.  Doubt I will be back.\n\nHad a reservation for 4 at 7:30 on Sat nite.  Informed things were running \"a little\" behind\" and invited to wait in the bar.  Fortunately we found a table there cuz the bar just kept filling up with dinner patrons, many of which now had no where to sit in the bar.  Had 2 rounds in the bar.  Waitress was very attentive and kept apologizing about the delay.  Finally seated in the restaurant around 8:30.\n\nRestaurant waitstaff made a very good first impression.  Very friendly, attentive, answering questions about the menu.  Meat cart came next.  The explanations seemed a little rushed and it was very difficult to hear due to the music.  We failed to close 1 of our menus so ordering was a little delayed.  Our bad.\n\nExperienced 2 episodes with broken glass as the table directly behind me was being bussed.  First time some hit me in the back.  Waitstaff had me stand up and gently brushed off my back and chair.  The 2nd time glass actually landed on our table.  Staff was concerned some may have landed in our soup.  Quickly removed our soup which was eventually replaced...eventually.  Accidents happen.  No big deal really.\n\nNow things really take a turn for the worse.  A manager of some type comes by our table at 10:00 to ask how dinner was going.  \"Not very well\" I reply.  \"Why not?\" she asked.  \"Cuz we haven't eaten dinner yet\" I reply.  You read that right.  2 1/2 hours after our scheduled reservation we still hadn't received our entrees!  She checks with the kitchen and our food arrives shortly thereafter.  Wife's steak was overcooked.  Mine was OK.  Sides OK.  Other 2 in our party thought their food was quite good.\n\nA second manager comes by our table to apologize and states the bill will be taken care of.  Nice gesture actually.  Well, our waiter must have then assumed he was going to get stiffed on his tip... which he didn't, because he then became invisible.\n\nMaybe we just caught them on a bad nite.  However, even if I rated the food by itself I would only go 3 stars.  Just didn\"t feel it was good enough to justify their prices."

            "review": "I feel that I, of all people, should be the one to be particularly harsh on this place.  And yet here we are.\n\nLet me explain myself a bit.  When you are dealing with a fancy restaurant of a celebrity chef, it is always important to remain skeptical.  So many celebrity chefs can (even if they don't) open a successful restaurant that survives based off name recognition alone, which I feel is a crime.  This skepticism goes doubly for Gordon Ramsay, because not only does he have a television show where he goes out to help fix failing restaurants, but a lot of the times on that show he focuses on the message of simple menus.\n\nThis does not make his fancy-pants restaurant a hypocrisy necessarily, as he is dealing mainly with small, family-run places on his show.  And when someone works their way up to that level of success, they are allowed a bit of excess with their restaurants now and again.  So let it be clear that those 5 stars sitting up there were not an automatic based off name recognition.  On the contrary, this place probably had to work harder to earn that review than most other restaurants would.\n\nSo yes, we have ourselves a restaurant with enough frou-frou to make you roll your eyes a bit.  The concept of \"a tunnel leading you from Paris to London\" is cool until you think about how wanky it is.  The neon art sculpture that symbolizes Gordon's hands as he prepares a Beef Wellington also induces a sort of \"That's cool...and stupid\" response in me.  I also like the Ferris wheel of meat they wheel around, even if there were likely less pretentious ways of presenting that.  But there is really where my criticism must end.\n\nService was spectacular the entire night.  We were lucky enough to be seated right by the kitchen so we had ready access to anyone passing by, but honestly at no point in the night did we really need to flag someone down.  There was always someone on top of the table, refilling water or wine, checking on the quality of the food, etc.  Every staff member we met was friendly and relaxed and made the experience all the more welcoming.\n\nAnd I'm afraid of running out of words so I best start into the food portion itself:\n\n-Wine List: I am not a wine snob. I know little about wine in general, and we only ever order it for nice dinners like this.  I applaud whoever thought to put their wine list on a iPad that would could search by vineyard or name of wine or type of grape. It makes the task a bit less daunting that it might have been otherwise.\n\n-Bread: Our server went over the many different varieties of bread they offered (and by many I of course mean 3).  I couldn't tell you what they all were, but I can confirm they were all good and were accompanied by...sigh...butter with volcanic sea salt...I mean it was a good combination but...we don't have to go that fancy Gordon.\n\n-Salad: Not mine, my wife's.  It's hard to be blown away by a salad...and neither of us were but that doesn't mean it was a bad salad. Props to our waiter for being able to accurately describe all the components before we ordered it though.\n\n-Beef Wellington: I had to. It's the famous dish, right?  I just had to order it or else I would forever be wondering \"What if...\" and then I'd get over myself and not care for a while.  But there would be that brief moment. The meat was perfectly tender, the pastry casing was crispy and paired perfectly with the meat. Can't say much of the potato puree and the root vegetables because there was barely any of them there, but at no point was I disappointed with the dish.  I will also note that the menu does say to allow for 45 minutes but it came out significantly faster than that.\n\n-Bone Marrow: I'm dying. I am dead. Good night. I want to put bone marrow on every steak I eat from now on. Perfectly roasted or whatever I don't care it was good and I enjoyed every second of it.\n\n-Filet: My wife added on the peppercorn sauce, which made it one of her favorite steaks.  Cooked perfectly, no complaints about it.\n\n-Shitake Mushrooms: Wow, what do you know? A side dish as a steak house that does not involve potatoes, cheese, or cream. Definitely very good, though my wife doesn't agree on that point.  This feels more like a preference thing, though, as she doesn't care as much for mushrooms or ginger...which were sort of main components of the dish so I can see why she might not be thrilled about it.\n\n-Sticky Toffee Pudding: I am dead again. This keeps happening. First of all take the most delicious, moist toffee pudding you have ever had.  Next, have a container of warm, rich caramel sauce to drizzle over it.  After that, have a prism of brown butter ice cream (you head me) to let melt on top.  Everything about it was better than the last part and it was gone all too quickly.\n\nThe service here alone deserved 5 stars.  The food secured the 5 stars firmly in place.  It's definitely a pricey excursion and make reservations in advance just in case (we made it a couple weeks out). But it's worth it."

            "review": "This restaurant blew me away!  Everything was presented well and tasted just as amazing.  Being a Masterchef fan, I had to come to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and experience what he is all about.  I saw the kids on Masterchef Junior cook the famous beef wellington and had to have me some myself.  I immediately booked a reservation for my family on Thanksgiving.  A holiday will gave me a justified reason to be completely gluttonous and gorge to the max.\n\nFirst off, Steak is located in the Paris hotel.  Just look for the big red sign.  At the hostess desk you will check in, and grab some cool matches :)  You are then seated in the bar to wait for your table.  We were then escorted upstairs to a cool booth with a great view over the entire restaurant.  \n\nWhen you are ordering the waiter will bring over a table with every cut of steak they serve and describe the marbling, texture, and flavor of each piece. \n\nThe bread plate is pretty darn good!  The two flavors of the pinwheel rolls (truffle and fig + bacon) are both amazing.  It is like a savory pastry that melts in your mouth.  The other breads were good as well, but the pinwheels are the winners.  The butter is served with black volcanic salt which adds a nice smoky saltiness to the butter.\n\nI got the Beef Wellington which is served rare-medium rare (this cannot be changed due to the way that it is cooked).  The Wellington was so soft and juicy I was in love.  The truffle and prosciutto around the filet mignon was tasty and the pastry around was super buttery and flaky.  So good.\n\nMy brother got the short rib which fell completely off the bone.  My parents shared a rib eye because they both have hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and heart issues that they don't want to die of.  The rib eye was sufficient for both of them to share.  The restaurant even cut it into slices to make sharing easier for them.  \n\nFor the sides we all shared the macaroni and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and fully loaded baked potato.  The sauteed mushrooms had a nice woodsy feel to it and the mac and cheese was great.  It has blue cheese in it, which surprisingly did not overpower the dish.\n\nFor dessert we shared 2 sticky toffee cakes!   I would have devoured it faster if I wasn't so fully of steak.  This is their most popular dessert and I can see why.  They pour the toffee sauce right over the cake when it comes to the table.  The cake itself is light and fluffy and the sauce is just heaven.  The salted caramel ice cream comes in a rectangle form, so it looks like a stick of butter.  It was a little bit salty for me and I would have preferred straight vanilla ice cream instead but it was all good overall.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend a lot on a good steak dinner.  The quality of the food matches the price.  It was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas so far. \n\nNotes:\n- Use your Total Rewards card to get a few bucks off everything you order.\n- Make a reservation.\n- Enjoy everrrythangg!"

We had a 7;15 reservation knowing that we had to leave around 9pm for a 10pm show so we wanted to order mains and dessert. We got seated on time and ordered our food around 7:40. We ordered just our mains knowing that if we ordered starters, we would really be against the clock. While we see other folks around us getting food, we are wondering where our food is. Had we known our mains would take over 45 minutes, we would have ordered a starter. Our server gave us the excuse that a serving of beef wellington takes 45 minutes to cook which is a lie unless you want it well done. I had the 18oz NY strip which was cooked well, but lacked seasoning. The fact it is aged in Pat Lafreida's pink Himalayan salt locker means nothing to me if the chefs can't season appropriately. \n\nAside from the server blowing smoke up our ass about the wellington taking so long, he was very nice. Sommollier service was good. \n\nOh, and I originally made a reservation for 4 months in advance. When I knew I had to make a change down to 2 people, the folks at Caesars told me the only tables available were 5:45 and 9:15?!? Really? They couldn't just change the number of people? I just told them to keep my reservation for 4. (This has nothing to do with GR Steak, but more of a complaint with Caesars.)\n\nWould I go back? No. With as many steakhouses in Vegas, I will with go back to Craftsteak, or try another place."

That was a awesome YELP feature to use by the way.  We got to the restaurant but to our dismay they were behind in seating so our reservation got pushed back over 30 minutes.  I would think Mr Ramsay would have blown up if it were him.  But we decided to wait  since we are on vacation and for us this was a once in a life time experience as he does not have a restaurant where we live.  \nOne we were finally seated we were taken to our table which was located up stairs and we have a great view of the restaurant patrons down below.  Our servicer was nice and also his helpers were also had on their A game.  \nWe were given a brief introduction on the restaurant. Then he dropped off an ipad that had a interactive drink menu.  Which I thought wow this is interesting as I haven't seen this before.  We could visually see the drinks and also place an order using it. Which we just had too. I ordered the Saracco, Moscato D'Asti by the glass and my boyfriend had his corona. The Moscato was delicious and was a great choice to go with the ambiance.  We were hoping to have a nice relaxing romantic dinner but to be honest this really isn't the place as the restaurant gets quite LOUD and we had to speak up to order and even to have a conversation.  \nThey brought us some house breads which were just OK however, the butter they served was wonderfully delicious. Yeah I know its butter but he did say something about it being special but I just couldn't hear him.  It was very visually pleasing to the eye though. \nNext up we had a smoked beef tartare which I thought was nice with the potato chips.  The presentation was excellent the taste was great but nothing spectacular. Then we decided to order the Royal long-bone chop for two.  I was debating between the famous roasted beef wellington or bone in rib eye but we decided on having the for two long bone chop which the waiter said it was like a rib eye.  First off I know its all about the marbling and the fat what makes the meat delicious but too me this was more just FAT then marbling.  Is it supposed to be huge chucks of fat?  I guess I am not used to this but it just wasn't as appetizing as I thought and I should have opted for the leaner beef wellington. But as far as the beef it was seasoned well and the charred outer areas were super tasty.  We had ordered a side, a spinach which was saut\u00e9ed and was cooked to perfection that was a great offset to the fatty meat. The both of us couldn't finish the \"for two\" portion maybe it's really should be \"for three\" to enjoy.  \nAfter our main meal I just had to try a dessert. So I yelped and found everyone talking about this sticky toffee pudding.  I had inquired with the server and he too confirmed that the sticky toffee pudding is highly recommended.  So, sticky toffee pudding it was!  This was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!  I liked the taste and the texture I would have held off on them pouring the brown sugar sauce all over the magnificent cake.  This was the best dessert I had on my trip.  This dessert too was enjoyed by my boyfriend who does not like desserts or treats he wouldn't stop eating it and kept on saying how grand it was and from coming from a non-sweet eater that is a huge compliment. \nAll in all, this place was nice, the food was good but not stellar, the service was top notched.  I did notice that there were only male servers and female hostess which I thought was interesting.  I think I would go again but this time for just drinks and dessert."

Their bread at beginning of the meal were quite tasty as well. The antioxidant signature drink was fab! Had awesome service from Jackie! Would recommend and will be back myself."

            "review": "We were treated like celebrities, despite just being a couple of geeks -Truly some of the best service I've ever received!  \n\nI made reservations with my little brother as a part of his birthday trip to Vegas- he is a HUGE Gordon Ramsay fan. I made a note of that on our online reservation and was SO impressed to see that the service staff not only seated us in the perfect booth with a view of the kitchen but also mentioned his birthday a few times- this is a super busy restaurant so added touches like that mean a lot! \n\nI'm not sure I could say enough to properly describe how much I enjoyed my dinner as a guest at Steak. As soon as you walk through the tunnel entrance, you know this is a different kind of food experience. I really appreciated the attention to detail, right down to the perfectly coordinated and unique uniforms with red accents, to mostly male service staff, the bustle of the kitchen...everything. We ordered way too much food simply Bc we wanted to try as many creations as we could and there wasn't a single dish I wouldn't happily enjoy again. (Yes- the beef Wellington IS delicious- it ruined me for life Bc now when I order it anywhere else, it never compares!) I loved that before ordering, a server presented a display of cuts of meat so we could learn the difference in flavour and texture before ordering. Perfect for newbies like us!\n\nOne thing we kept mentioning long after the food had digested was that the service was absolutely out of this world. At one point, my brother knocked his knife off our table and within a half a second, a passing server scooped it up and another ran back out to bring a replacement. I know it seems silly but I guess you just have to be there to see the service for yourself! \n\nEnjoy! \n\n(Thank you, Steak, you did not disappoint!) \n\nXo"

We ordered the beef Wellington and the filet mignon as our entrees with a loaded baked potato as our side.  While waiting for our entrees we enjoyed complimentary bread.

            "review": "Probably one of the best meals I ever had. Made reservations about a month and a half in advance, and it's a good thing I did because I was talking to someone outside the restaurant and he said that he tried to make reservations a month in advance but the place was already booked. If you don't have reservations, you can stand in line before the restaurant opens (like 4:30ish) and you can get a seat at the bar.\n\nFor my appetizer, I had the pork belly and my friend had the Caesar's salad. The salad was nothing special, but the pork belly was good. We both ordered the Beef Wellington. Takes about 30-40 minutes to cook the beef, but we ordered the Wellington for two, which is one gigantic cut of meat cut in half (each person gets one half) so it takes even longer to cook. If you get the Wellington for one, you get two small pieces of meat versus one big fat piece. I never had Beef Wellington before but I had to try it after watching Hell's Kitchen, and it was one of the best pieces of meat I ever ate. I typically order my meat medium well because I don't like that bloody taste, but this is only cooked medium rare. It was amazing with no nasty raw meat taste! Perfectly seasoned with a salt and pepper crust and pastry dough on the outside. The sauce really added a lot more flavor to it, too. Also ordered a side of the sauteed spinach, which was a bit too salty, peppery, and watery. For dessert, I got the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was really sweet, but sooo yummy!\n\nOverall, expect to pay about $100 per person (including tax and tip), and that's without drinks. Absolutely the best $100 I paid and definitely worth going to again! Christina, the winner of Hell's Kitchen was there, but she didn't really look like she was very busy. Most of the time she was standing around or folding napkins. The waiter told us that we could go by the kitchen to take a picture of her because she won't come out to the dining area when it's busy, and when we did, she pretended to look the other way and wouldn't even look at us when we tried to get a picture of her. Kinda rude, especially since most of the patrons at the restaurant are fans of Hell's Kitchen who want to see her and are supporting her. Is it so hard to smile for 1 second for a picture. Geez."

Our meal started off with the bread \"mmm the bread plate\" which had three types of breads. \n\nThen the coolest thing of all they brought out a cart of different types and cuts of meats and explained each one of them to us. We ended up getting the ribeye and the beef Wellington which they split in two for us so that we can share. We got 2 sides to accompany or ribeye and they were the Asparagus and Mac & cheese and trust me when I say that you will not be disappointed if you order these sides. And if you are looking for a sauce to go with your steak I would try the peppercorn sauce which was to die for. \n\nI have to say that everything that we ate was so amazing and so delicious it brought our taste buds alive.

I'd made reservations at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant far in advance because I considered it my duty to taste his cooking, and see if it warranted the insane cursing & arguing that I see on his TV shows. Well--it does. He set the standard  AND the bar so high, he can yell & curse all he wants to! This was not dinner: this was a true 'dining experience'...from the decor to the greeters/hostesses and wait staff-everything was SUPERB. Everyone was dressed neatly & tastefully-as they are at most upscale restaurants but this staff took it up a notch. I couldn't help but notice the shiny cuff-links all of the men wore and the tasteful black dresses that the women wore-had me flashing back to Robert Palmer's Addicted to Love video. Sexy but reserved, with minimal makeup. The food...was simply DELIGHTFUL; I NEVER eat anyone's mac-n-cheese but my mother's-- until now. That macaroni & cheese gave me the warm and fuzzies and so did my scallops and lobster tail...My aunt smacked & groaned through her steak, my mother smiled through her lamb chops & my cousin practically prayed over and into her beef ribs the entire time we were there. :-) The whipped potatoes and spinach-as well as the drinks were wonderful. We topped everything off by sharing a warm apple cobbler & ice cream. Excellent, excellent, excellent. WELL WORTH the money. We can't wait to go back!"

Both my son and his friend are in the cooking industry and wanted to eat at one of GR's restaurants. We chose Steak. \n\nWe were seated on time for our 8:00 reservation at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  There is also seating upstairs overlooking the main floor.  My first impression was how loud the restaurant was! (I'm surprised that nobody else has mentioned this in their review.)  Seated across from each other, we were forced to speak at a very high volume to be heard over the music. However, it was not loud enough to ruin our evening. \n\nMy son immediately noticed a celebrity at the table next to ours.  It was the star of Fast and Loud.  Although I had never seen the series, it was apparent that he was a celebrity by the way the wait staff was hovering over his table. At one point, someone in his group stood up, raised his arms over his head, and hollered at the top of his lungs. The other people at his table laughed awkwardly but the manger immediately came over and put a hand on his shoulder to sit him back down.  \n\nBack to our meal:  We began with the foie gras and carpaccio. We enjoyed both of the apps,  but the foie gras was particularly outstanding. It was probably the best part of the entire meal. \n\nOur server then brought over the meat cart and showed us the different cuts of meat they had to offer. It was a nice demonstration and actually informative (I learned where certain cuts came from). For our entrees, we chose GR's famous beef wellington, lamb two ways, prime rib, and king crab legs.  Our sides were potato puree, asparagus, and blue cheese macaroni and cheese.  The beef wellington was fabulous and cooked perfectly, and we all drooled over the lamb two ways.  I personally could not stop eating the potato puree; it was so smooth, creamy and delicious that I could eat that seven days a week.\n\nAt the end of our meal, while clearing the table, the bus boy (a middle aged man) spilled a half glass of red wine on my husband's white sweater. The busser was mortified but we tried to make light of the situation.  The floor manager came over and apologized profusely and sent three complimentary desserts to our table.  We were already so full that we didn't eat much but they looked beautiful.\n\nWhen we left the restaurant, both our son and his friend said it was the best meal they had ever eaten.  (It was also the most expensive meal but it was worth the experience.)"

And the food is [Beep] delicious.\n\nMenu changes have made the food more affordable, approachable, and enjoyable including new sources for USDA Prime beef and butchers cuts of American wagyu.  There remains enough in your face wow factor to pay homage to the British celebrity, bad a$$ chef.\n\nStandard steakhouse chilled seafood cocktails.  Pass.  There are many more exciting starters.  Top props to the smoked beef tatare.  Prime beef, hand cubed, mixed with capers, onions, lemon zest a great anchovy aioli topped by a cured quail egg yolk.  Briny salinity brought to life by the citrus zest that serve to elevate the flavor of the beef.  Smoking before service adds a touch of acrid, bitterness that heightens complexity.\n\nFor something warm and light, the green and white asparagus soup.  Creamy, rich, supple, like a fine veloute, the green asparagus soup surrounds the white, a topping of blue crab meat for complexity, and crispy leeks for texture.  Very clean vegetal notes whose flavor goes on and on.\n\nThe signature Lobster Wellington and Beef Wellington are outstanding.  The first comprised of a just cooked through lobster tail wrapped in flaky puffed pastry atop a celeriac potato pure with a rich herb beurre blanc.  The latter, a well seasoned and seared fillet brushed with mustard, surrounded by a rich duxel, gently sweetened crepe and flaky puff pastry and drizzled with a red wine demi.  A dish so good, you won't even notice the other things on the plate.\n\nTo the steaks.  All are well trimmed.  USDA Prime cuts are dry aged 28 days and show a very mild beefy funk.  They are boring in comparison to the butchers cuts.  The American wagyu skirt and ribcap are flavorful.  Both have a great even sear.  The skirt, a denser texture, beefier with a slight sweet finish, the rib cap, tender, and oozing flavor from the cooked off fat.  Both steaks are a cut above at a great value.\n \nFinally, the A5 BMS9+ Kobe brand wagyu.  Thick cut and beautifully seared on all sides.  Yeah it can be cooked further but enjoyed this way, it allows the greatest diversity in clean, sweet, beef flavors to be experienced.   ($35/oz, 4oz minimum).\n\nVery knowledgeable and friendly servers (thank goodness they don't speak with a British accent).  Efficient.\n\nA well chosen wine list with good balance between the old and new worlds.  Typical Vegas resort markup.\n\nA restaurant that has aged well into its role as one of the go to eateries on the Strip with the goods to back up its celebrity namesake. {Beep] well done."

With high expectations and recommendations from friends that had visited previously we were still blown away by the menu offerings and decor. \nThe steak offerings were brought to the table and thoughtfully explained as to the grade and cuts of each steak.  \nI ordered a Filet Mignon and asked for it to be prepared with extra peppercorns prior to cooking and how I preferred my filet to be cooked just over medium, but not medium well.  IT ARRIVED PERFECT.  I couldn't have cooked it better myself.  My partner had the Sea Bass and enjoyed every bite.\nMy main reason for writing this review is to compliment the waiter(s)  DONNIE & CARLOS.  For a busy restaurant, these gentlemen had PERFECT timing, worked to satisfy our requests and gave THE BEST SERVICE I have EVER received in any restaurant in recent memory.  If I could I would have taken Donnie to-go!  \nGordon Ramsey was in-house this evening when we arrived but departed soon after.  We missed being introduced to him, but was glad to hear that he does stop in the restaurant often.  Unlike some celebrity restaurants we have gone to and found that namesakes rarely visit their own establishments (E.L) due to too much TV appearances and spreading themselves as thin as icing on a petite-four.\nI will definitely make it back to Paris Hotel/Casino and hope Donnie is working on our next visit.  Request his station when you make a must-have reservation.  We booked ours through  the concierge at he Wynn upon arriving in LV and they were able to get us a suitable time.\nAlbeit a bit pricey, we were graced by lady luck and put $4 in a slot machine and hit for $300 on the second spin just before walking in the restaurant. So our dinner was a bargain! \nOnce again. Thank you Gordon for paying attention to your venues and Thank you Donnie for providing OUTSTANDING & PROFESSIONAL service unparalleled in today's service industry. You deserve more praise than any tip we could provide. You made this our most memorable meal of the decade.\nBest wishes for a prosperous New Year. And look for us to return soon.\nScott and Chris."

My voice does not carry well, so it was impossible for my husband and I to carry on a conversation. Not very romantic for an anniversary dinner. =(\n\n2. We were seated REALLY close to other couples. I guess try not to go when it is busy, if that is ever possible. It was extremely awkward eating and trying not to listen to the other people talking around you.\n\n3. I don't know if anyone else experienced this but, my husband and I were just generally uncomfortable the whole time we were there. This place tries to be too fancy in my opinion. There were like 3 different spoons on the table and I had no idea which one to use for my appetizer. We just wanted to stuff our faces, but we couldn't because the atmosphere felt too stiff.\n\nSo, overall I would say go for the gimmicky experience and for the awesome food!

After watching the whole season of Master Chef Jr. I was mindblown at how those little kids could replicate Ramsay's infamous beef wellington. Everytime I see pics of his wellington, I start salivating, hoping to try it one day. Well...THE DAY FINALLY CAME!! I know he has the London West Hollywood restaurant in L.A., which served the wellington, but the reviews weren't great. I'm so glad I waited to try his food in Vegas, rather than the L.A. restaurant!\n\nWe had reservations at 9:30pm, but arrived to vegas a little late Fri night due to traffic. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us at 10:15PM.\nNOTE: HELL'S KITCHEN TASTING MENU STOPS AT 930PM\n\nWe were guided through the \"tunnel\" and given the option to our table upstairs via elevator or stairs. The view upstairs is amazing with this giant neon structure of Gordon's hands making the wellington. The interior is chic decorated in colors of black and red w/ a big British flag painted on the ceiling. Downstairs is an open kitchen, bar, and framed photos of Ramsay. It's very classy yet romantic at the same time\n\nOur server Yaron was such a sweetheart! We came for our anniversary & he made it very memorable. I felt like royalty dining in this restaurant!  After browsing the menu, Yaron pulled up the meat cart and the carnivore in me wanted to devour every meat on that cart! He said that if I finished the 24oz bone in rib eye, he'd applaud and give me a free t-shirt. I will most definitely be back to take on this challenge :D\n\nShortly after ordering, the fresh breads came out on a plate (different than most places serving it in a basket). We ended up eating 2 plates of the bread 'cause it was so bomb! I wanted to get some to-go at the end of the night, but forgot to ask. ALL 4 VARIETY OF BREADS WERE SOO GOOD. My fav were the brioches w/ truffle and pancetta (bacon). The walnut baguette was good as well especially w/ the butter. I LOVE the butter here w/ the sea salt. Gives texture & taste. \n\nEnglish Chowder - smoked haddock, scallops, fingerling medallions, \ncitrus pearls. Wow at first I thought it'd be like clam chowder, but this takes chowder to a different level. Initially it came out in the soup bowl w/ just the scallop, haddock, etc. & then the server pours out the soup from a little pot. Very nice, thick consistency yet not over laden w/ butter. Scallop was cooked to perfection! It was a very filling soup, not your typical chowder.\n\nMaine Lobster - O..M..G.. the lobster was a work of art. The lobster cream was delicious, I wanted to lick the whole plate. Lobster was cooked to succulent and had a beautiful red color. Very tender, buttery smooth, fresh. The lentils were cooked perfectly as well, but I do wish that they accompanied this dish w/ something else other than lentil.\n\nBeef Wellington for 2 - Over $100 for this bad boy. It's funny the say for 2, when really it's just one wellington, but cut in half. So usually if you order wellington for 1, you get just half the wellington..It literally took 45 mins to get this dish. The wait was agonizing 'cause my mind just kept thinking about how good it'd be. When the plate finally came my heart was racing. This dish looked exactly like it did on T.V.! Everything was beyond amazing. Pastry crust was flaky, filet inside was roasted to medium rare. All the flavors in one bite blended so well I was so amazed. The potato puree and red wine demi glaze were excellent. The glazed vegetables (parsnips & carrots) accompanying the dish had glaze that were shimmering.\n\nDemi Roasted Bone Marrow - HUGE bones plated beautifully, decorated w/ green salsa verde. These totally blew away Mastro's bone marrow. I didn't care if my arteries would be clogged, these babies tasted so rich as we scooped the marrow out from the big bones.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding - I noticed every table ordered this and so we had to try it since everyone raved about it & it's their signature dessert. I'm not sure why they call it pudding, when it it really is a date cake. I LOVE the brown butter ice cream, it's cute how they even made it look like a stick of butter. Yaron drizzled the toffee syrup onto the cake and as it flowed spreading throughout the plate I couldn't wait to dig in. The date cake was moist and when you eat the ice cream w/ the cake & toffee, it's an explosion of sweetness in your mouth.\n\nWe didn't finish til after midnight and were the last ones to leave the restaurant (they close at midnight). Midway through our meal, we felt bad staying so late so we told Yaron that he could bring out the dessert when the Wellingtons came out, but he insisted no rush and that we should take our time to enjoy our meal. That is customer service at its finest. We never felt rushed at all, truly an amazing experience at this restaurant. Can't wait to come back! O BTW, I wanted to get a pic w/ Christina, but was notified she has left and is now exec chef at BurGR!"

The restaurant itself is pretty nice and modern looking. If you plan to go you will definitely need a reservation as it does seem to be pretty busy all the time.\n Our waiter was great...knowledgable and explained the menu pretty well. They use iPads to show off their wine list and drinks which was pretty cool. Now to the food... We passed on the prepackaged meal for two and decided to order whatever we wanted. I didn't care about getting an autographed picture with it anyway! My wife and I decided on the Kobe beef sliders for an appetizer...they tell you appetizers are really single portions but we didn't want to fill up so we split the two sliders. They were pretty damn good...next we ordered Kobe filets and added two side dishes to the meal, the Mac and cheese and the potatoes. The filet was excellent. Very tender and tasty..Mac and cheese was awesome...the potatoes were just ok. To top off the meal we decided to have the sticky toffee dessert which is not bad at all. So in all the food was good...was it worth the $300 check at the end ehhhhh not sure. I think you pay for the experience and the Gordon Ramsey name. What kinda put a damper on the experience is burping up the macaroni flavor for the next 3-4 hours after dinner. My wife and I both looked at each other at some point and mentioned this taste kept popping back up the rest of the night. Not sure what was going on with that . We do frequent steak places wherever we travel and I don't think there was a huge difference between this place and another favorite place of ours in Lake Tahoe that is half the price. Go for the experience if you are a fan but bring your wallet and watch out for the macaroni burps!"

Numerous people constantly asking us if we needed anything more.\n\nBread:  Sparse but some of the best around.\n\nBaked Potato:  Large and good.\n\nBeef Wellington:  Very good (my wife's order).  A bit dry without any drizzle or au jus.\n\nSteak: Great taste but incredibly tough.  Had to hold fork with two hands and cut (saw) away with other? hand!!  I know there will be people who say I should have sent it back and in hindsight they are probably right.  But it was my wife's birthday and I did not want to bring up the problem in any way to put a negative spin on a pretty good evening (came from Jersey Boys show).\n\nMy other opinion is that the guy bringing around the display of meat is a bit cliche.  I remember Chef Ramsey making fun of restaurants that have photos on their menu.  Well, probably 100% of the customers have seen a piece of raw steak.  When we asked the guy who had a long speech about meat a question......he looked puzzled and did not know the answer (easy question about the prep at this restaurant).\n\nIt was fun being in a celebrity's restaurant.  Most of the food was good.  Most money I have ever paid for a meal for 2 people."

For date night, we couldn't figure out where we wanted to eat at since we weren't too hungry and it was already 9:30pm...most places were closing at 10pm but thankfully, Gordon Ramsay keeps his doors open until 10:30pm.\n\nThe restaurant, especially the entrance, reminds me of a club...a well-lit club.  We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar area and didn't have to wait to get a table.  We were given an amazing plate of different kinds of bread. 2 were aged parmesan, 1 bacon, 1 mushroom and 2 lemony breads. In a world full of free sourdough bread, complimentary bread got exciting again. We got the medium rare 24oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye, fingerling potatoes and mac n cheese.\n\nDRY-AGED BONE-IN RIBEYE: their medium rare is bloodier than usual but I'd rather eat a bloody steak than a hockey puck.  It was tender and no sauce was needed. Just pure meaty perfection. 5/5\n\nFINGERLING POTATOES: with parmesan and truffle...they were flavorful. The perfect side for a awesome piece of meat 5/5\n\nMAC N CHEESE: with peas, truffle and 3 different cheeses - blue, cheddar and parmesan.  It was tasty, rich and quite heavy. 4/5\n\nFor personal reasons, we skipped dessert. The service was alright. For the price and quality of meat we got, I may have found a new favorite steak place in Vegas.  But no, I still love Mario Batali."

She came with sample of meat which was pretty neat I think to see the cuts and quality of what you're about to order . (Posting a video) \n\nSoon as we sat down, they served us a platter full of wide selection of breads with the butter with Black British Sea Salt . It was so delicious . We asked for the most popular dishes there and she suggested the rib cap - which has been my favourite steak I've ever eaten so far ! Just melts in your mouth and the glaze is absolutely delicious . My husband ordered Beef Wellington (Ramsays signature dish) which I've tried as well and I liked my rib cap better . Wellington had tons of flavours and in layers . It was like a party in your mouth . Although one item that sticks to my tastebuds still and I can't get over it has to be the truffle Mac n cheese made with blue cheese . God bless them for coming up with that dish !  Make sure to order that . We've also ordered loaded baked potatoes which was very well seasoned and delicious as well. \n\nHowever , a plain glass of water will cost you US $10.

It was early and we were in no hurry, so befor dinner we wanted a leisurely drink.  I was surprised to find not a single rye on the list.  I'd have just preferred a pour.  Okay, so we ordered drinks. The drinks--The Drifter and The English Garden--were very fair.\n\nThere are televisions in the bar--the bar of a guy from the UK.  We were in Vegas while the (Women's) World Cup was starting, and that evening's game should have been on in this bar.  But instead of a World Cup game, they had on some (replayed) midseason college baseball game.  TCU, no less.  \n\nFinally, almost bored and already disappointed, we made it to the food. \n\nAn aside:  The couple directly south of us in the bar asked more than once, before they ordered, if the could send something back if they didn't like it.  Sure, was the answer.  \n\nThe amouse bouche bread was interesting.  The tiny\ncinnamon roll-looking items were best.\n\nDinner delivery:  Fast and not very informative.  \n\nThe loaded baked potato was good and hot--but we're not here paying this sort of money for that, are we?  The mac n cheese was boring and fair.  \n\nThe short rib was good, nothing to write home about.  The same for the other steak.  \n\nOur meal was, sorry to say, just fair.  \n\nI've been looking to criticize his restaurants.  I mean, shouldn't we all--as a matter of fairness make him/his place/a place he contracts with Paris to put his name on--make him live up to his own hyper-critical standards?  You'll see in my other reviews that I loved his burger joint, BurGR.  I loved his pub at Caesar's. But his steak  joint was the least satisfying, by a great measure. \n\nOverall, I give it a fair.   2.5 stars.  But I have to choose between 2 and 3, and I'm being nice."

I tried very hard to not have my expectations too high because like others here, I didn't want to have one little thing go wrong and my whole night ruined, but try as I might my expectations were through the roof. They weren't too high, because they were met and 10 fold more. Below is my review \n\nFinally 5pm on Monday night.  We check in at the front and the hostess says \"oh I see you're big fan\" to which I reply \"indeed I am\". Then she says \"well we have a special seat for you\"  And where does she take me?  Right in front of the pass!  OMG it just can't get any better, not only am I here, but I'm getting to see everything right up front and personal.  So exciting.\n\nNext we ordered drinks. How cool is it that they give you the drink menu on an iPad?  It was very cool. Don't try taking them though, they're locked down.  (no I didn't try to take one)\n\nThey brought us a plate of complementary breads which were clearly an indication of the wonderful food we were about to partake of.  They were so good!\n\nNext order of business is to order an appetizer I had scoured the menu before we got there, so I pretty much knew I wanted to try the British Ale Onion soup.  I chose right. This soup is so good, full of sweet onions, Boddington's English Ale, and topped with Welsh rarebit. YUM!  must look for a recipe.  I have to tell you the customer service here is bar non the best I've ever had anywhere.  Chuck had to go up to our room to get a decongestant and while he was gone the sous chef was looking for him because his soup was ready, and I told the gentleman that he could just leave it and he'd be right there.  Well he wouldn't hear of it, he waited for about three minutes and threw away the soup sitting at the pass and brought a new one when Chuck sat back down. CRAZY!\n\nNext came time for us to order our steaks, and they wheeled out this cart of the most amazing meat I have ever seen!\n\nChuck had the American Kobe rib cap and I had a beef wellington.  I just had to have this also since Gordon Ramsay seems to take the dish so seriously, and I really couldn't see myself ordering it anywhere else.  I am not going to lie, the fillet inside of that was so tender you could eat it with a spoon!  I don't recall ever having a steak so good.  I probably wouldn't have wellington again simply because of how much bread is on the outside of it. Too much for me to eat.  I also ordered a buttered poached lobster tail as an accompaniment for my steak but I really should have done crab legs for only 3 dollars more.  I am not much of a lobster fan, but I figured if it was going to be good some place this would be the place. The taste was good, but it was still a lobster tail that to me seamed tough. *shrug* Not to mention that for $35.00 you'd expect it to be bigger than a prawn, and it wasn't. \n\nEven that little bit was a tad disappointing, it was still very good, and since there was so much else, Chuck and I split the bite of lobster and finished up our steaks, which again were AMAZING. \n\nWe decided to have another cocktail and let our food settle because we had our heart set on trying the English stickee toffee pudding and browned butter ice cream. The staff there was so nice both the head chef and the head sous chef came and chit chatted a little bit and told me what a gentle person GR is and definitely a genius in the kitchen. Duh I knew this.  Just a relaxing non assuming nor stuffy atmosphere at all. \n\nAll I can say about this dessert is my husband said \"OMG F*ck strawberry shortcake\" Which until now was his favorite. \n\nWell goodbye Gordon Ramsay, until we meet again *sigh* \n\nThe take away from this was that I don't think I'll ever enjoy something like I did that night. Not just because of the place it was, but because I was with the love of my life.  He was so happy to spend that evening with me. I truly am a blessed woman.  I love you honey. \n\nThe only negative that I can say, were the other guests of the restaurant. PEOPLE yes I know you're in Las Vegas, but have some F*cking class.  You don't go to a 5 star restaurant, dressed in shorts and flip flops with crying toddlers."

If you're feeling chatty and casual they open up and chat a bit more when visiting the table.  Feeling private or reclusive, they deliver and pick up silently and only engage when they need to ask a question.  Whatever the mood, they always deliver the same impeccable service.

I ordered it black and blue because I'm a steak purist, not a steak heretic.  The watercress leaves and the sauce were an impressive flavor addition that only enhanced the flavor of the steak, and did not cover anything up.  That being said, I assumed I didn't need to talk time and temperature with them when paying $63 for a steak in Chef Ramsay's kitchen.  Their version of black and blue was cooked at too low a temp for too long; crust too thick and under done.\n  The bone marrow came highly recommended by friends, I'm not a fan of just fat.\n  The asparagus was my second favorite side; fresh, crisp, not over cooked, and the light morel cream was perfect.\n  The gratineed spinach"

I was blow away with service and entrees. It was AMAZING!!! The food was delicious, but what really took the cake was how awesome the staff were! They were welcoming and upon asking recommendations, they showed a variety of knowledge from the glasses of wine to the dishes we wanted to order. Thumbs way up! I'll definitely be visiting again! :D"

While I love fries cooked with truffle oil, my French fries tasted like they had been fried in old, rancid oil. \nThe worst part of the meal was the fact that our plates were taken away before we were done eating! We still had utensils in hand, chewing, etc. Three or 4 busboys /waiters descended upon our table so quickly, we didn't have time to say \"WAIT or STOP!\" before everything was taken away. No one EVER asked us if we were finished eating, and it was pretty obvious that we were not. \nI have always enjoyed watching Hell's Kitchen and other Gordon Ramsay shows. After this dining experience, I've lost my taste for them as well."

            "review": "I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and was told that this is the best restaurant in all of Las Vegas to go to for the beef wellington.  Mr. Ramsay is very famous for how he handles himself on TV, but I was curious how his famous restaurant experience would be.  I went with a co-worker who loves the place.  The staff at the front of the restaurant was polite but seemed in-experienced.  My co-worked explained that the women who sat us should have explained the restaurant and light sculpture in the ceiling.  The wait staff was very polite and generally knew which sides to serve people on and how to serve the food.  We both ordered the beef wellington and a series of sides.  I hate to say this, but the beef wellington was just okay.  It was very middle of the road for a middle of the road pallet: cooked appropriately (medium rare), couldn't taste the veggie puree, and the crust was flaky, but not ultra savory.  I thought the truffle mac and cheese was very good (however, it's a more common food in the midwest, so it was not unique).  The ellotes I should have had a heads-up would not be made properly by the name: Mexican corn.  I asked the waiter if it was actually mexican ellotes or if it was an Americanized version.  He assured me that it was authentic and had the chef's twist.  It was essentially creamed corn with some jalapeno slices on top (not ellotes).  I was a little disappointed.  The one thing that was outstanding was the butterscotch cake dessert.  Overall, the experience was positive, but I think if I'm going to spend this price point going out for a nice client meal, I might choose a different restaurant."

I have been to many upscale restaurant and watching all of Gordon Ramsay's show. I am usually glued to his tv shows watching how great of a chef he is and the service he expects his teams to provide. \n\nWe traveled all the way from Arizona to celebrate my boyfriend and his buddies birthday at Gordon Ramsay steakhouse. This was the only reason we traveled all the way to las vegas. We had high expectations and heard so many great things about the restaurant.  \n\nFirst off, it started by the multiple attempts to try to make reservstions. I had to call atleast 5 times with multiple run arounds. The first time, the reservation line told me I had to talk to special reservation since I had a party of 8. They provided me with a number. This number they provided me could not take reservations for less than 10. So then I call the reservation line again. The reservstion line tells me they cannot take reservations for more than 6. They told me I had to talk to the restaurant. So I ask them for a number. The reservation line tells me they don't have a number.  They tell me they can transfer me. So they do and I end up back at the same reservation line again. After about 3 attempts of transferring they provided me a number for a manager. I was irritated already at this point. However, I continued to try over and over because this was for my boyfriend and our friends birthday. Finally, I got in touch with a manager.  When I spoke to the manager and made the reservation I confirmed with the manager atleast 3 times if this was Gordon Ramsay Steak inside of Paris hotel. The mamager reassured that I was talking to the manager at Gordon Ramsay Steak. She even guaranteed me the reservation was there and not to worry that she had it taken care. I took her word for it and thought after this horrible reservation experience everything was going to be great. \n\nForward time a month later..we show up at the restaurant to find out the reservation as the staff claimed was made at the wrong restaurant. The restaurant also never even called to confirm our reservation for saturday night. Most restaurants call the day before to confirm. Had they called I would have known there was a \"mix up\" and made arrangements or gone to the correct restaurant...as they claimed I was absolutely wrong.  I had no Gordon Ramsay even had a pub and grill. We get to the restaurant and we are told the reservations were made at the pub and grill. I asked how is this possible I told the manager I was reassured and guaranteed that I was talking to the manager at the steak restaurant.  The GM happened to be standing there..I believe his name was JP. He was beyond rude. He did not once apologize for the mix up. Blamed it completely on me and stated that his staff would never do such a thing and I was absolutely wrong and had no idea what I was talking about. He kept trying to give me a confirmation number.  Great that you have a confirmation number but what is this going to do? The fact was..the \"GM\" who I could almost bet should have been hired for great service provided the worst service I have ever seen in a high end restaurant.  The GM could have handled this is very many different ways. Had he offered to even call the other restaurant to let them know we were on the way or even apologized for a mix up that would have been fine and I would have appreciated the help. The fact that he just continued to blame me and give me a snooty stuck up attitude that was terrible and made us feel as though we were not good enough for his restaurant. Words can't even explain how he talked to us and how unbelieve the \"GM\" was. I have never been so upset before. I have managed restaurants before..I also come from 12 years of customer service jobs. I can reassure you my friends and family will never be back to any Gordon Ramsay chain of restaurant.  We were extremely disappointed and let down by this experience.  Especially after traveling all the way from arizona to celebrate and eat at Gordon's restaurant."

Hostess was cordial & waiter was attentive but maybe to speedy to leave our table each time so as he was not thoroughly listening to our requests.  When an honest mistake was made he was argumentative.\n\nWe ordered a \"Drifter\" cocktail to start.  The waiter sped away then returned to ask  if we would like to begin with a drink. We thought we had just ordered one.  We ordered again.  \n\nThe cocktails arrived and immediately after shrimp cocktails were placed in front of us.  This was merely moments after discussing the tasting menu wasn't going to work for us as my husband didn't like seafood.  When we gained the attention of the waiter we asked why shrimp cocktails had been delivered and he explained that we had ordered them.  When we said we had not he commented that, \"yes, you ordered them\".  Once more we explained we had not as my husband did not like seafood and would never eat it.  \n\nWe believe the confusion was he heard incorrectly when we originally ordered the \"Drifter Cocktail\"; which was delicious.  Mistakes happen but it was disconcerting that he argued with us.  \n\nMy husbands gnocchi appetizer was delicious.  My pork belly app. delivered with a crispy skin and the app as a whole was tasty; only problem was that it was entirely a chunk of fat, no meat at all.  Typically pork belly has a thick layer of fat over a layer of meat.\n \nMy husband ordered the Beef Rib Cap with a side of Ginger Glazed Shitakes and I ordered the Beef Wellington with Sriracha Roasted Broccoli.  Our entrees were delivered together but instead of steak it was fish; halibut I believe.  Had to go back.  After they cooked his steak they returned to the table with his entree and the SAME now DRIED out wellington now medium temp on its way to med. well and the red wine demi-glace was crusted to the plate.  The sides were tasty.\n\nOne has to wonder if the Gordon Ramsey you view on television and youtube is a completely different person than the one in real life or if he has no idea his restaurant is being run as it is.  We have no issues spending good money for a wonderful meal but this dining experience left a bad taste in our mouth.  \n\nThe sommelier was spot on with her suggestions and we thoroughly enjoyed both the wines we had and the port my husband had after dinner.  \n\nThe Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar was delicious.  \n\nIt was just thoroughly disappointing, after looking forward to sitting down with Gordon Ramsey's Signature Beef Wellington for months, to be served a dried out, crusted over, over cooked dish that did not present appetizingly nor tasted anything more than less than average.  I was unable to even use the demi-glace as it was crusted to the plate, dried out and not to be budged.  \n\nAfter the rough experience we had already been having and the waiter arguing, politely but still arguing, over the incorrectly brought appetizer there was no way I was going to send back my beef wellington.  I figured my husbands steak would then be overcooked and in addition, worried about having to wait another 45 minutes as we had reservations elsewhere after we dined.  Our local dinner theater in the small town of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin serves a better beef wellington at less than half the cost.  \n\nWe are saddened that we were not left with the superior impression we thought we would have after dining in a Michelin Star rated Chef's establishment."

The large 2 inch pieces of fat were rather unappetizing, the whipped potatoes looked like soup, the loaded baked potato was unique- not in a good way and the desserts were butter overkill. \n\nI expected more from Chef Ramsay.

Our bartender Neal, (I believe), made my friend and I, the two best dirty martini's we have had in a long time. The olive stuffed with blue cheese and bacon just made the drink that much better. Before we could take a second sip, our table was ready. \n\nOur waiter was Anthony. Steak should clone him. He was fabulous. He explained everything in depth with enthusiasm. He even pointed out things, like the neon light sculpture on the ceiling, that were particular to Steak. He made us feel welcomed.\n\nThe food:\nMy friend and I shared a Caesar salad. It was great. Just there perfect amount of dressing. the scotch egg was a treat.\nFor the main course there was a debate. I wanted the Beef Wellington and my friend wanted the Wellie and American Kobe Wagyu Beef Cap (she and I had never had that before.) We agreed to split our meat entries with each other. Well, after the first bite for each of us, we decided sharing was not going to work and gave each other a sliver of our steaks. The food was out of this world.\nFor desert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was my friend's birthday and Anthony had a candle added to it. She felt very special.\n\nPrice - It's a steak house on the strip. It is not going to be cheap but for what was served and the service received it was worth it. It was about $130 per person including drinks (at $13 per x 4).\n\nI would recommend this restaurant as your fancy meal out when in Las Vegas."

I completely disagree with them too, by the way. \n\nWe made reservations for 9 pm on a Monday and I didn't make the reservations, but my boyfriend said he had no problem getting them a couple days before. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern feel of the place with the club-esque atmosphere.\n\nThe staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Our server, Charles, started us with the drink menu which comes on an iPad, but despite what it seems, you can't actually order drinks from the iPad. We ordered a Vesper and the HK Antioxident [sic]. For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras and half dozen oysters. Before our appetizers came out we got bread and drinks. The panchetta bread was delicious and I could have eaten a whole loaf by myself. For our entree we ordered the wellington for two and we were informed it would take 45 minutes which was fine with us although I'm sure some people would have been less than satisfied with such a wait. Our waiter walked us through the cuts of meat that we had to choose from with the meat cart which is a little unorthodox, but if you don't know much about steak or you forget the difference between a porterhouse and a ribeye, it's good to know what you're getting.\n\nIt took longer than say, Chili's, but by the time we finished our appetizers plus 5 or 10 minutes, our wellington was out. We also had a side of creamed spinach which was very tasty. Charles had recommended one side to split and said we'd have the perfect amount of food and he was correct. I thought I would have no room for dessert, but I was wrong. Enter the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. This is a must have dessert. We split an order and it was the perfect sweet ending to a phenomenal dinner. \n\nEverything beginning to end was the caliber of food I would expect from a place with Ramsay's name on it. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and I would definitely go back here. However, if you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place to go. It is a great experience though if you love and appreciate good food."

Well let me tell you now that yelp has failed us this time! \n\nThe food was too pricey for the quality of it. I ordered the Filet 8oz (~$56) with asparagus ($12). It was good, filling, but a little chewy. I ordered it medium rare but I don't have a clue whether it was cooked the way I ordered it. Why? Because the restaurant was too dimly lit and the hanging red neon installment portraying Ramsey's \"hand motions\" made everything look red. \nMy SO ordered some sort of rib-eye steak ($60) and accompanied it with the Mac n cheese ($12). His plate was a lot more filling and satisfying than mine. If you get full easily like we do, don't bother with appetizers or filling up on the bread. \n\nThe decor was misleading. The whole place looked ostentatious but when you get to the bathroom, you get a dose of reality! It's small, boring, a bit on the dirty side--and the toilets function poorly. They couldn't put a little bit of effort on that? \n\nOverall, please look elsewhere if you're looking to get a nice steak that is worth every penny."

So he try to send back and not messed with it cuz I was half way done with my meal. But they bring out the third one saying that they want to get it right. However, still not right, he had like two bite then cut up the steak to show the waiter how rare it is. The manager came over to talk and apologized. The bill was wrong too, because they charged him a drink that came out wrong. Like I said he has food allergy and the only drink he feel safe to drink is captain. He ordered captain w ginger ale and they brought a Drifter. They brought it back and bring out the right one but I guess didn't take that out the billed. My boyfriend didn't want to make it any more awkward so he didn't even care to tell them to take that out. Over all. We had steaks that come out right and better, quite disappointed!

It's very awkward for the servers because the kitchen is downstairs. They have to constantly go up and down for every little item. The waiter brought up our drinks and realized he forgot the straws and said he would be back with them. It took 5 minutes to come back.  We were seated for almost 10 minutes before given a menu.  It's weird that the hostess who seats you doesn't hand out the menus.  My husband had to flag down a different waiter to place our order.  We ordered blue crab soup, pork belly and oysters as appetizers.  We ordered the  beef Wellington and bone in ribeye along with mushrooms and Brussels sprouts and the bone marrow.  My husband says his ribeye was so tough he had to \"saw\" his way through.  The crust on my beef Wellington was soggy!  The filet inside was cooked well and was tender.  So I ate the inside and left out the puff pastry.  Very disappointing. The Brussels sprouts were tasty but undercooked and hard to bite into. Bone marrow was rich as expected but nothing extraordinary. Mushrooms were earthy.  Pork belly was good.  Dessert, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding. It's not really pudding but a date cake with toffee syrup. It was probably the only fantastic thing I had that night.  Everything else was just average."

This is supposed to be a fine dining experience. This last time there were SEVERAL children and grown men wearing shorts and flip flops at dinner. I'm sorry but this is not the buffet! We asked our waiter about this and he said they don't enforce the dress code because it got too hard with most people being out in the heat. For me this is not an excuse, as my husband & I walked all the way from The Mirage in a suit and dress. I feel we (and others) would return more often if a dress code was enforced to help create a more refined atmosphere."

The restaurant itself is upscale and modern, and it certainly has a more trendy vibe than Ramsay's other restaurants in New York or London. I also appreciated that the hostess allowed guests to order drinks at the bar before their tables are ready; we tried some of the signature beers and cocktails, and all of us enjoyed them immensely.\n\nThe dinner experience was great as well. With 4 recent college graduates eating, we could definitely eat generous portions, so we were a little worried about entree size. However, two of my friends ordered the 24oz bone-in rib-eye steak, which was exceptionally large and out of this world. We also ordered the foie gras for an appetizer, as well as a number of sides and sauces. Overall, the food was outstanding. You MUST try this steakhouse if you are looking for the ultimate Vegas dining experience.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the meal was the service. Everything was impeccable, and both our waiter and the floor manager stopped by our table to see how our experience was. There is a dress code for the restaurant (business casual or better), but this is typical for Ramsay. The waiter was knowledgable about the entire menu, and you can order drinks from iPads given to each table (a nice, modern touch!).\n\nI'm sure everyone is wondering about the prices, and yes, they are expensive. The total bill for 4 guests who each ordered 2 drinks, entree, sauces, sides and 1 appetizer to split was just under $500. However, the experience and the quality of the food is hard to beat, and if you haven't had a fine dining experience before, you really have to try Gordon Ramsay Steak. Highly recommended!"

HX Antioxidant Cocktail\n$44 Fish & Chips\n$6 Heineken\n\nThe chips in the fish & chips was nice, as was the Antioxidant cocktail. Rather straightforward recipe, but it is awful rare to see acai berry liqueur. The Pim's Cup looked rather delightful as well. \n\nThe clam chowder was decided all-round as weird and disappointing. It was my mother's main dish and she didn't like it at all.\n\nThe pork belly was recommended as the crowd favorite from the appetizers and I know I wasn't impressed, but if it's kurobuta, then I've had it in Japan by people that seriously worship the animal. It couldn't compare. \n\nLastly, the Wellington. My fandom of it and my tastebuds disagreed. I want to say I liked it but I'm pretty sure I didn't. Pastry dough is often my favorite part of a pastry (like pie crust, or pate chaud), but on the Wellington it played such an insignificant part. Then the prosciutto. I loooove prosciutto. Throw it on pizza, eat it on crackers or spinach or mozz cheese. Mmmm. In the Wellington, it was a brown limpid thing. As for the steak, it was cooked to preference, but beyond that, I don't remember much flavor. As high end restaurants I've been to go, Mastro's Steakhouse in Costa Mesa, CA was soooo much better. \n\nDecor\n=======\nAll red, dark, and moody. As a popular restaurant, I think they needed more chairs than were comfortable, because I honestly did not like our seat. Across the way from us was a nice alcove, those bud-shaped booths that use the seats as walls, but they tower to the top for privacy. \n\nThe light arrangement in the center is supposedly the motions of Ramsay as he makes the Wellington. It's also the same pattern imprinted on the menus and who knows what else. \n\nService\n======\nThe female servers are all dressed in the same black dress, which gives it a nice Vegas. There is the meat block with the explanation - helpful. The service was neither superb nor awful, so I guess that means it falls right at mediocre. Someone else was right; some of the policies just kill you, like with the tastings. My mini-hurt was that everyone at the table had to place their order at once. I was set on Wellington the minute we decided we were going to Ramsay but it takes 30/40 minutes or so to prepare from the moment you order it, and while I would've liked to order it as we placed our drink orders, had to wait till the rest of the entrees were set to order as well. \n\nExtra!\n======\n- Even without a reservation, seating is pretty quick. \n- I think they ask everyone to go to the bar first; just their thing."

For desert, we had Gordon's sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. We truly felt like we experiences the Gordon Ramsay experience at this top notch kitchen. As a bonus we were able to be seated at a booth which was approximately two feat from the line and within touch of Christina Wilson, who demanded and achieved perfection from her excellent team of star quality chefs.\n\nTop remarks for a top dining experience.

I had GR Steak on my radar ever since it opened, so I booked a reservation over the phone as soon as the next Vegas trip was finalized. TIP - It's best to call the restaurant directly after 4:30pm, and not through the hotel people. \n\nThe vibe of the restaurant is definitely fun and energetic. The hostess will explain the origin of the red neon squiggly lines up top, and that you're instantly transported to London through the tunnel. We were seated upstairs, which had an awesome view overlooking the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n- Butter poached Maine lobster\n- Hamachi crudo\n- Roasted beef wellington\n- Sticky toffee pudding\n\nAll of the dishes were well executed, and seemed to get better as the night went on. Both appetizers were good, but nothing memorable flavor-wise. While the lobster tail had a nice sweetness, it was a bit under-seasoned. The thinly-sliced hamachi was light and fresh, but I wouldn't order it again.\n\nMy wife and I shared their signature beef wellington, and it was a success. I will always remember this dish on Hell's Kitchen, and how it was the dish that doomed many chefs on the show. The beef was juicy and tender and full of flavor, especially when scooped up with the potato puree and red wine demi glace. Cutting it was a bit of a challenge, as the outer pastry crust would just completely come off.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the meal was dessert. Save the best for last, as the cliche goes, right? It's not a complex dessert, but every component excels. The sweet pudding cake was moist, spongy, and very delicate. With the brown sugar toffee sauce poured over the top, it was instantly transformed into something extraordinary. Mixed with a smear of brown butter ice cream, which looks exactly like a stick of butter, my taste buds were truly titillated. Most impressive of all was that this dessert was not overbearingly sweet.\n\nOverall, this was a nice meal. Service was friendly and efficient, on top of everything. You can even save a few bucks by having a Total Rewards card. I wouldn't mind returning in the future to try some of their other steak options."

Why only a 3/5 well first of all the place was too loud they had the music blasting as if it was going to be a night club conversion for 6pm on  Sunday evening. I could not hear what the server was saying on the menu. The Interior design was and nice modern interior,  just too loud resulting in 1 less star. Interesting use if the ipad for drink selection. \n\nFor appetizers well do not order the asparagus soup,  I really wanted to say wtf is this crap, it taste like baby food, no flavor at all just like how Ramsey yells like in his show. The Maine Lobster was good for an appetizer. The bread was good cinnabun looking bread with a savory taste. \n \nThe steak selection was good, but If i were to compare the preparation and quality of the steak  to another steak house like craftsteak; Ramsey place would be a 4 of 5 star steak wise. I ordered a rib cap medium rare, it came medium rare and was nicely aged and seasoned, the filet was good, get it medium rare or it will come out over cooked. ( I think it was so loud the server misheard that I wanted my filet medium rare, it came medium and was over cooked to my taste, again because it's too loud in heard anything). Lastly the New York Strip which was excellent. I don't recommend this place for an anniversary, or a first date. The ambiance just did not feel well. I did not feel relaxed. \n\nThe sides dishes we great. Fire Roasted Corn I recommend, Mac and cheese well its mac and cheese, can't mess that up too bad, and the sauteed spinach and a side of king crab legs. Sides were good proportion. \n\nDessert was incredible it made up for the rest of the the so so overall experience. It would have been 2 of 5 stars had it not been for the incredible dessert and coffee. \n\nI have to remember they just open June 12th so maybe they need to get that place fine tuned, adjust some of the menu and adjust the volume of the background music.\n\nNow on my top scale steak places here in Las Vegas for the price we paid, I have 3 number one steak places that are to me 5 of 5 stars. Botero at Encore, Prime at Belagio, and Craftsteak at MGM grand. \n\nBasically I paid for 5 of 5 stars restaurant with over all food at a caliber of only 3 of 5 stars, as a result i would not go back."

We were served by Dennis, who was funny, attentive, and helpful. The waitstaff were actually all really great, so the service was definitely on point here. \n\nWe got the gnocchi appetizer, green market salad, the beef Wellington, Kobe sliders (as my main), the mac and cheese, and the sticky toffee pudding. \n\nAppetizers: my husband really enjoyed the gnocchi, including all of the accoutrements. My salad was fresh, well dressed and well seasoned. We also had the bread plate, and the baguette was my favorite! \n\nMains: my husband thought the Wellington was well seasoned and cooked (on the meat) but the pastry was not crisp and I thought the temperature was a bit cool for my preference. My sliders were small but juicy, lightly seasoned, and came on little parmesan buns. It was also accompanied by garlic steak fries. . .which would have been fine except the mac and cheese was terribly garlicky, lukewarm, and lacked seasoning. So it was garlic on garlic. \n\nDessert: it was little hard to swallow getting two espressos at $8 a pop but it was harder when it was served super short, no 'foam,' luke warm, and  waaaaaaay before we got our dessert. As for the dessert itself, it was not life changing. The cake is large enough to share and had a very light crumb. Topped with the toffee sauce, it gave it a nice richness where the caramel notes really shined. The brown butter ice cream was smooth and rich. Together, it was almost too much of the same redundant caramel flavors that each already had going on. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I went for my own experience. But to say that everything was executed on the level that Ramsay demonstrates on his shows, that was a definite miss. As for the expectation of the fabulousness if this place, overrated. \n\nSkip this place and try a different steak place as this one didn't meet expectations."

The restaurant did not seem to be full and there was no one else waiting but for some reason, we were completely rushed to place our food asap BEFORE we even placed our drink order. We ordered Beef Wellington which has up to a 45min wait so we all decided to slowly enjoy our bread plate and appetizer except we weren't given that option as our plates and silverware were taken away before we were even finished with them. 3 of us split a bottle of wine and the 4th had a cocktail, we were never asked if we wanted anything else to drink once our glasses were empty, it just seemed they wanted us in and out as quickly as possible.

We ordered 3 steaks: The beef wellington, american eye, and the long chop, All medium Rare. We were so excited to try the famous beef wellington by Gordon Ramsey, but it came out just okay. The outer crust was not crunchy but soggy. There was barely any gravy on the bottom. Definitely, not how Gordon Ramsey described it. Now, the embarrassing part: American eye and the long chop were completely burnt and blacken on the surface. Both of my friends tried them and split them out because they were soo bitter and hard to swallow. Just by the reaction, I didn't even want to try. We asked the server to take a look and when he touched the steak, literally black hard burnt pieces fell off. I kept on asking him if this is how it is suppose to be made but he wouldn't answer but instead he recommended another steak called american cap that will only take 5 minutes. 5 minutes to prepare a steak that cost almost one hundred buck. Really? Like are these foods microwaved??? Of course, we have already lost our appetite, so declined it. I'm just surprise how the chef can even approve of serving those steaks to their customers. But even the server said the steaks were too dry and over done but remember we wanted medium RARE. So that was no excuse to say the steak was cooked at a very high temperature as explained by the server. I cannot blame the server for how the chef cooked the food. But the reason I gave the service a 1 star is because we asked the server couple times to bring one of my friend warm water. Eventually we had to ask another worker who wasn't helping our table to bring the water . By the way, I spent $18 on some plain WATER. Being a high end restaurant of course come with higher expectation. Especially if you advertise it Gordon Ramsey steakhouse, you expect every dish is a delicacy. We are a big fan of Gordon Ramsey. It is an ashamed to relate this event to him."

            "review": "Sorry folks they all cannot be great, \nSo after an amazing experience at \"Gordon Ramsey Burger\" we decided to step it up a notch and try out Steak\" Now this first part is strictly my opinion, I feel that in a establishment of this alleged caliber they music should not blare so loud that you cannot have a conversation. The decoration or ambiance was at best gaudy again my opinion. \n   We sat for some time, I would say 15 minutes before we were met by the assistant waiter, who after that was amazing. I wish I had gotten his name. When our waiter did show he was Obviously very busy, but was very professional. If this restaurants review was soley based on the staff it would be 5 stars all around. They are the only reason I am giving 2. \n   So our first course arrived I had 1/2 dozen oysters my wife had Shrimp. The oysters were good, however we have just returned from New Orleans and these just did not compare at half the amount for twice the price, I was a bit discouraged. The shrimp my wife has was over cooked and chewy. enough said on that.\n    We were then presented with our salads. I had Caesar, my wife had a garden salad. The Caesar salad was good but he dressing tasted bottled. When I visit a restaurant of this alleged caliber and our final bill is 200 dollars not including our tip I kind of expect a homemade Caesar as I have had at other places. My wife again had a garden salad, in her words \"Blah\" especially the bacon circles which seemed old... very old.\n     Now for the Steaks. I have nothing good to say here. I had the Bone in Ribeye. They only compliment I can give is it was big. I ordered Medium rare and received a Very rare steak. It needed among other things seasoning. I do not think an ounce of salt was used in the cooking of this piece of meat along with any other seasoning. Bland is the best way I could describe it. I actually only ate half it just was not good. My wife got the Chicken breast. 1 word \"dry\" and bland... ok 2 words. Really anything else to say   We were very excited about this visit and left very disappointed. I honestly feel I could have gone up the street to outback and had a better steak for half the price. I am happy most seem to have a great experience sadly ours was not as we would have hoped."

I love how he brought out the meat station to explain the various cuts and meat.

Mac and cheese was delicious, maybe at the top of my list of MnCs. Cheddar with Parmesan, truffle, and English peas. The peas were a nice touch! The fingerling potatoes were nicely roasted and crispy on the outside; however, I thought they were a little too salty. The street corn was perfection: jalape\u00f1o, mayo, creme fraiche, cayenne, Parmesan, and cilantro. I could eat this for daysss.\n\nFor the app we shared Wagu Carpaccio ($24), which comes with deviled quail egg, puffed rice paper, and truffle salsa. The truffle is really potent but I loved everything about this app and the presentation was beautiful. The quail egg was tiny, tiny. \n\nOverall, I loved my dining experience here.

I've been watching Gordon Ramsay shows for years, so I was very curious what standard he holds for his own places. I've been to a few other \"celebrity\" chef restaurants in the past that have been a pretty big disappointment, but this was very good. To some, rolling out a cart of uncooked steaks showing you options might be off-putting, but I loved it. The server convinced me to try the Rib Cap and I'm not sure I've had a better cut of beef. \n\nI only have to knock it down for the atmosphere, I know this is Vegas, but I was hoping for a more quiet spot. The vibe was very much like a Vegas night club and it was a bit difficult to concentrate. Definitely took away from the tasty meal."

Was in LV for my son's 21st birthday and this was our big splurge meal on night one in town.\n\nWe started with the chilled seafood tower which was shrimp, lobster, king crab, clams, oysters, mussels served atop an awesome ice sculpture with a number of dipping sauces.  Every bit of the seafood was fresh and delicious!  For our entree, we got the porterhouse for two and it was huge, sliced for us and cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as requested.  They also split a loaded baked potato for us and we tried the very grown up tasting truffled mac and cheese and they both were superb.  For dessert, you're kidding right?

Our busboy was a million times better than our server so I slipped him an extra $20 bill on the side. She has no personality or suggestions. Was pretty but not very talented as our awesome busboy who suggested the best drinks and desserts. The raw beef Wellington made me really sick that evening and was in terrible stomach pain all night.

With all the flavor you wouldn't have known you were eating a filet. My wife who isn't a fan of steak or red meat loved it as well. The Mac and cheese was pretty good and her chicken dish was very moist, flavorful and juicy. \n\nFor dessert they are known for their sticky toffee pudding, which happens to be her favorite as well and she thought this was the best thing ever.

The only complaint I heard was from my 75-year old father-in-law who said his steak was fatty. Well duh. Next time order a filet!\n\nBut, all in all, a fantastic meal.

This was one of those experiences. \nThis review is a little late (went here for our anniversary in October), but it was such an amazing experience and I can't stop thinking about it. I felt I must share. \nHaving been to our fair share of celebrity restaurants, and having been let down time and time again, we feel that Gordon Ramsey Steak really exceeded our expectations and more. \n\nThe bad: tacky uniforms (for both ladies and gents) and music is too loud (srsly, I'm not that old and don't care about loud music, but there comes a point when I have to shout across the table). \n\nThe great: service, food, and everything in between. We didn't specify it was our anniversary on our res, but I casually mentioned it when we first sat and the server noted it. We got a candle and inscription with dessert and the staff all wished us well.  I asked if we could order a scotch egg (only on prix fixe menu) but the server brought it out as an amuse for us anyway! We ordered the foie, bone marrow, oysters, wellington, rib cap, and sticky toffee pudding. The bone marrow has got to be the best deal in town. 3 fatty pieces with accompaniments and bread (I asked for toppings on the side in case I didn't like them). Everything else was awesome and cooked perfectly. The wellington and sticky toffee pudding definitely live up to standards (if you watch his shows on TV, you know how high his expectations of those 2 items are). Service was on point, not in your face, not pushy, not trying to upsell. Bussers/food runners cleared and dropped everything in a timely manner. \n\nThank you Gordon Ramsey for caring about your name and your restaurants!  (unlike so many other celeb chefs who are just using their fame to cash in)\nCan't wait to go back!"

            "review": "After three years of yelping, checking in, and adding photos, I've finally decided to write a review :)\n\nI'll be honest, when it comes to dining at restaurants owned by celebrity TV chefs I get a bit more critical and picky of the food. So when my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here I was skeptical about the quality of the food and for the first half of our time there, I was right to expect disappointment.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nDefinitely very vibrant. You'd think you just walked into a hip, ultra modern bar and not your typical steakhouse. Plus, the twisted neon light sculpture on the ceiling (an artistic rendition of Ramsay's hand movements) is a great eye catcher.\n\nDRINKS:\nOrdered our cocktails off an iPad (techy place, but not something I'd deem as necessary). I ordered the English Garden and the bf ordered a Sidecar. Both were delicious, both had that kick I was looking for in a cocktail as well as the refreshing \"tastebud enticer\" I needed to really pique my appetite.\n\nThe pre-meal bread they give out is delicious.  Not enough to fill your stomach, but enough to leave you wanting more.  The lemon thyme focaccia and brioche (fig and pancetta) were my faves, but I always seem to judge a steakhouse by their butter (don't judge)...and that said butter came with Hawaiian black sea salt. YUM.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\nBiggest disappointment ever.  We ordered the Herbed Ricotta Ravioli and the Shrimp Cocktail.  The ravioli was a lovely medley of flavors, but definitely not worth the price...presentation was not too impressive either.  The shrimp cocktail was a deconstructed version and I wish they hadn't because shrimp cocktail really is at its best in its natural state.  Plus, it was extremely salty...I had quite a few sips of water/cocktail throughout the duration of my ONE shrimp.  If our meal had ended here, this place would've gotten 3 stars, but the actual meal and dessert really saved this place from my never-again-list.\n\nTHE MUST HAVES:\n#1. Beef Wellington. (Sure, you have to wait a good hour for it, but it's worth the wait...and if you're coming here to try the Beef Wellington, you should already know it takes about an hour...so don't complain!) It's the most heavenly filet I have ever tasted...all wrapped up in a delightfully flaky pastry dough (other reviews have said the dough quickly becomes soggy, but my bf and I wolfed ours down before that even became a possibility). You've heard of excellent sashimi melting in your mouth, but steak? Yes, this one MELTS in your mouth.\n\n#2. Tempura haricot vert. Who would've thought these could be so delicious? And with the aioli? Double yum! Perfectly fried, not dripping with oil, crispy thin tempura layer. Just the way I like it.\n\nDESSERT:\n#1. Sticky toffee pudding. At the table next to ours I heard the man complain about how delicious this dessert was, but way too sweet. I have absolutely no concept of too sweet and we ordered this scrumptious dessert in the blink of an eye. The sweet pudding cake paired with the brown butter ice cream is a match made in heaven. To die for! And a nice way to ease you into a pleasant food coma ;)\n\nOverall rating, 4.5 (but since I can't do half stars a 4 on yelp).  Before the Wellington and dessert, this place would've been a 3...service wasn't exactly up to my standards and appetizers were a big no no.  The steak and dessert really saved the day here!\n\nStill dreaming about my next Vegas visit so I can pop in for some Beef Wellington! YUM!"

At medium well, the steak melted in my mouth, soooo good and tender! The most tender medium well rib eye I have ever tasted. \n\nThe complimentary bread here was awesome too. The butter w the salt was so good. The bread is all you can eat, so eat up and ask for more. The best part is that we took home some of our left over food, and the waiter gave us a set of new fresh bread to take home! This was after we had two helpings of bread at the table. \n\nWe ordered a side order of mushrooms to go with our steak, very good. Various types of mushrooms came with the dish.\n\nand last...the sticky toffee pudding with butter ice cream. I debated on getting one since I was so full but I'm so glad I did!!! The sticky toffee pudding is nice and light but tasted so good and with the butter ice cream, it's like you're in heaven!!!\n\nJust a few words of advice. Don't opt for the bottled water they try to push on you in the beginning. Ask for water in a cup, the water tastes filtered and fresh so no need to buy bottle water for $6 a bottle. Also, they will tell you the steak takes 30 minutes to come out, no need to order appetizers, the compimentary bread will fill you up and you can get as much as you want at no extra charge! Also, make a reservation as this place is pretty booked solid.\n\nI also got to take a picture with Christina, Hell's Kitchen winner from season 10.\n\nI love this place!

The Beef Wellington is their signature, but for seafood lovers, this was the perfect alternative. \n- Mac & Cheese ($13) plus freshly-shaved truffles ($14 additional)\nbest side ever. The mac & cheese was decadent, but not overbearing. It had the right amount and variation of cheeses to elevate the dish. The truffles took it over the edge. Each bite was bliss. \n- Foie Gras Butter\nCould've done without this sauce. It was much too heavy, and did not compliment the steak, as I assumed it would originally. \n\nCOFFEE:\nthe coffee service really \"wow-ed\" me. When a latte was ordered by my friend, 3 beautiful chocolate-dipped tablespoons came out. Each spoon had a letter: A, B, and C. A stood for Amaretto, B for Bailey's, and C for Cognac. It was to flavor the coffee. I was blown. This was taking service to another level.\n\nWhile this isn't my favorite restaurant in the world, I would definitely be willing to go back upon another visit to Sin City."

Thinking still water ...would be tap water (Seattleites never have to worry about this!), we were a little bummed that there was a $22 charge for water.\n\nDrinks: Pimm's cup & Strawberry margarita ...pretty solid but not quite a \"wow\" experience \n\nTasting menu: \n    1. Amuse bouche - scotch (soft boiled quail) egg over a bed of red wine braised cabbage was delicious! I just wished it wasn't so tiny! \n\n    2. Spring vegetable salad (asparagus/pea shoots/candied rhubarb) with a tiny thin slice of seared ahi tuna. It's light and refreshing -- perfect for the 95 degree weather. \n\n    3. Mushroom risotto & seared scallop: A-ha! This is the dish that always get screwed up on the tv show but it was done perfectly here! Great texture & great flavors (they used morel mushrooms) \n  \n     4. Beef Wellington: The one dish I was looking forward to!! It's a classic dish that I just can't seem to find anywhere nowadays. The filet was incredibly tender...the pastry was nice and flaky...and I loved that mushroom spread that he used (in replacement of pate). \n\n    5. Dessert: blueberry tart paired with a scoop of  citrus-y vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end the night. \n\nService: super friendly and not stuffy at all. As a gift for those that order the tasting menu, we went home with a photo (not a print!) of Gordon Ramsay himself (signed, of course) and a copy of the tasting menu signed by Christina Wilson (last season's winner). She even personalized it for us since it was my boyfriend's birthday."

(eaten w/ our bacon mac and cheese via room service!  but i digress...)\n\nservice was excellent.  the assistant wait staff were always around to refill our waters or to get us anything else we needed.  and of course our server was great, too.\n\nto finish the meal, we tried the peach medley dessert.  it's peaches done three ways; sorbetto, streusel, and these tasty ice cream sandwiches.  all super yums.  and guess what?  upon walking out the restaurant, we had made perfect time to go pick up our tickets.  couldn't have asked for more."

I really can't stress enough just how good the service is here. The waitstaff know what they're doing.\n\nAs far as the food goes, its a 5/5. I had the beef wellington, and it was just incredible. A great amount of food, and an arguably fair price for such a fresh and exquisite meal. The sticky toffee pudding is delicious, and the presentation was beautiful. As a marker for just how good the sticky toffee pudding was, keep in mind I was so stuffed by this point between the app and wellington + sides that I had to force myself to eat it because I just couldn't leave without trying it.\n\nMy one potential complaint - Ramsay, there are a few touches that are unnecessarily pretentious, and that could be driving some people away. For example, needing to point out that the light on the ceiling is \"Gordon's hand movements while he makes his signature dish, the Beef Wellington\", was a cheesy and unnecessary touch. The cooking and service speak for themselves, without all that.\n\nBut still, definitely a 5/5, because the service and food are just as good as it gets."

We're all in the military and stationed worlds apart from each other; all love cooking, and cooking shows, and food, so the highlight of the trip was supposed to be Gordon Ramsay's. It did not work out that way at all.\n\nWe were all severely disappointed afterwards.  There were so many chunks of salt on the Wellington that I could barely taste, as it was cooked well (asked for rare/Medium Rare).  They sent back; it came back well (again) and even saltier.  My friend ordered the ribs so salty they puckered all of our lips and couldn't be eaten.  Another friend asked for a steak, medium/medium well, and it was cooked so well it could not be cut, and was, again, overly salted.  We all love salt... but not to the excess where the salt is crunchy and needs to be chewed, the pieces are so large.\n\nAlso, if you want the risotto, it's only allowed if every person at the table orders the entire Chef's menu.  Since 5 of the 6 of us wanted it, but we had one vegetarian, none of us were allowed to get the risotto.  Think of that: We had 5 of 6 people want to spend over 200/person, but because one person was a vegetarian and didn't want that, none of us could enjoy it.\n\nI had been looking forward to going to one of his restaurants since I first heard of him; my first experience will be my last, and I don't even want to watch the shows anymore because I was so disappointed.  I saved up for this trip because this has been a bucket list item; I'm severely disappointed and Hope that this review stops someone from spending the money to go all the way to Vegas for Gordon Ramsay's:  I don't want anyone else as disappointed as I was.  (Trust me: When your \"main event\" for Vegas turns out terrible; everything else is not as fun)."

As I walked in I heard someone say that it was the best steak he had ever had, and I soon came to agree.\n\n The service was outstanding with the waiter taking the time to have conversations with us and answering questions about many things rather than just serve and leave. It actually didn't take long at all for anything. The only part I would have been able to do without was the meat cart. By the time he went to get it everyone knew what they wanted to order and I don't find looking at a large cart of raw cuts of steak very appealing, but I'm sure in the future we can just request to have that skipped. The bread was wonderful and there was a variety which is nice. The water was bottled and imported from the UK and we were given a choice of the type (sparkling or still). The beverage menu was on an iPad which was cool because you could just order on there rather than wait for the waiter. The steak was amazing and the loaded baked potato was huge and also delicious.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant if you are in Vegas. You won't be disappointed."

I watch A LOT of cooking tv, including Gordon Ramsey's shows. This would be my first experience at one of his restaurants.\n\nOur reservation was at 5:45 and we were seating immediately. The hostess made a couple stops on the way to our table to give us some background into the artwork that made up the restaurant. The place has a very modern feel to it. Although I sort of wanted to watch the cooks in action, I was happy to be seated in one of the balcony tables over looking the entire restaurant.\n\nOur server (Dennis, I think) did not miss a beat. He was friendly and talkative enough to be effective, but not so much as too interfere with our special evening. Actually the whole staff was great. From refolding our napkin when we got up to answering any questions we had, they were a great team.\n\nI did make a pitstop to the bathroom so I could catch a glimpse of Christine from Hell's Kitchen. She was there expediting...and apparently doing a great job. The food was exceptional!\n\nMy girl got the beef wellington and I ordered the ribeye. Both were some of the best meals we had eaten. We also shared the fingerling potatoes. They were alright, just potatoes. In hindsight, I might have ordered the potato puree.\n\nFor dessert we shared the S'mores cheesecake. It was presented beautifully and tasted even better.\n\nI HATE paying for water at a restaurant (2 bottles cost us 18 bucks), but I'm sure they would have provided tap if we asked.\n\nIf you are in Vegas and looking for a great dining experience, give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."

It's a mortal sin to leave food that good uneaten.\n\nWent to Gordon Ramsay Steak with some co-workers tonight. We kicked off with an appetizer of the pork belly on grits. I'm not a big fan of fatty meats, so I skipped that part, but the grits were buttery and cheesy and gooey and delicious. \n\nWe all, to a man, ordered the American Waygu rib top. I would never have ordered it if it hadn't been suggested to me. Now, I will never enjoy a different cut of steak, as long as I live. The marbling in it made it taste like it was infused with butter. It was so tender I didn't need my knife to cut through it. There were no chewy, stringy bits, even though it was medium rare. There was this gorgeous carmelization on the outside of the meat, and it literally couldn't have been more perfect. \n\nWe got the truffle mac and cheese on the side. Don't bother with that - all you can taste is bleu cheese, and nothing else. The asparagus, on the other end of the spectrum - I wanted to order some of that to take home. I'm a big, fat bastard. I don't eat green things. I wanted to order another plate of asparagus. 'nuff said. The potato puree was ok - not bad, not great. The asparagus, though.\n\nThen, against my better judgement, I ordered dessert. Why, oh why, did I order dessert? I feel like I owe my pancreas an apology. Again, since we're a pack of lemmings, we all ordered the sticky toffee pudding. There are two things Brits do better than anyone else - subjugate brown people, and make desserts. This is the best dessert anyone has ever made, bar none. It was... it is horrible to use the word indescribable in a review. My vocabulary fails me, though. It was the culinary equivalent of a long hug from your mother. It was warm, and chocolatey, and the toffee was rich and gooey, and the ice cream on the side complemented the flavor so accurately that the only thing you can do is keep eating before your body realizes how incredibly bad for you it must be. \n\nSo, if you're looking to drop a ton of cash and eat about 75,000 calories in one sitting - TOTALLY WORTH IT. This is the place."

Immediately the American Kobe caught my attention.  My understanding is that American Kobe beef is actually Japanese Kobe cows, but raised in Nebraska.

            "review": "Our close friend decided to celebrate his birthday in Las Vegas and selected Gordon Ramsay's Steak in the Paris Hotel and Casino as the location for his birthday dinner.  I was skeptical having eaten at Chef Ramsay's restaurant at the London Hotel in West Hollywood as the portions were freakishly small and after having spent $200 on dinner, I still needed to take my husband through the drive-thru in order for him to have a complete meal.  But, this was not our birthday dinner so we stayed quiet about our concerns.\n\nWe walked through the casino to find the unusual entrance to the restaurant.  It reminded us of a tunnel, but no one said anything to us as we entered.  We checked in and were asked to spend a few minutes in the bar while our table was set up.  When we were called we were brought back to the inside entrance of the restaurant and at the point our hostess explained that when we entered the restaurant that we left Paris via the chunnel and were now in England.  That's actually kind neat, but maybe that should have been explained when we first arrived in England and not minutes later as an after thought.\n\nWe were escorted through the main dining room heading towards the upstairs seating when our hostess stopped us and pointed to the ceiling fixture in the center of the room.  She then explained to us that the fixture represents Chef Ramsay's hand movements.  No explanation of what movement his hand is making, just his hand movements.  Took everything inside me to not giggle as the hostess was explaining this to me with a straight face.  This was only the beginning of Chef Ramsay's displays of arrogance.\n\nWe were seated upstairs and were directed to a bi-fold on the table containing the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu.  If everyone at your table orders the tasting menu for $145 per person (and its an all or nothing order) then you get to take home the accompanying autographed photo of Chef Ramsay.  Arrogance display number 2.\n\nWe were then given our menus that were engraved with the same representation of Chef Ramsay's hand movements, along with a logo of Chef Ramsay holding two knives.  Arrogance display number 3.  God forbid you forget for even a moment whose restaurant you are in.\n\nThe Wheel of Meat (my name for it, not theirs) is then brought to the table and each cut is introduced and explained.  We are also told that the meat is hand selected by Pat LaFrieda of New York and dry aged for 28 days minimum in his Himalayan salt room.\n\nI chose the English Chowder as my starter.  It was very yummy and not terribly creamy, and I loved finding the citrus pearls that popped in my mouth.  Everyone else at the table ordered the onion soup.  I was able to have a taste of it and while it was very flavorful, I actually found it to be too sweet.  And for those who don't know, Welsh rarebit is cheese sauce on toast and has nothing to do with rabbit.\n\nI have been a fan of Beef Wellington ever since I was a teenager.  I have since even made it twice for Christmas dinner.  It is not often on restaurant menus due to its complexity, and as this menu states, the length of time required for cooking.  But I felt tonight that my dinner dates could wait the 45 minutes it would take for my Wellington to be prepared. While the Wellington was prettier than any version I've prepared, I was actually disappointed in the taste as I found it to be bland.  I'm not certain if any pate was coated on the meat as is traditional.  It simply tasted like meat inside puff pastry and I like my recipe better.\n\nMy dish came with its sides so I allowed everyone else at the table to decide the sides and I simply had a taste of each.  Both the potatoes and the mac & cheese were yummy, but I felt bad as everyone else was so focused on their steaks that we left most of the side dishes behind.  Admittedly I never had a taste of the asparagus, which is a shame as I love asparagus.\n\nWhen we were shown the Wheel of Meat the server focused a great deal of time on the American Wagyu Rib Cap as the rib cap is rarely on restaurant menus.  The rib cap is also referred to as the tastiest part of the cow.  That was all the men needed to hear as both of them ordered it as their main course.  And while I was only allocated one bite, I must agree that it was yummy.\n\nWe did not order dessert that night as there was birthday cake waiting for us back at the hotel.  That said, we all left with our tummies filled to the brim - the complete opposite of my last Chef Ramsay experience.  I would strongly recommend Gordon Ramsay's Steak not only to any Celebrity Chef Foodie, but also to anyone who wants to enjoy a good steak while in Vegas.  It was a great experience and I'm proud to say that I was again able to withhold my giggling at the ceiling fixture when we were leaving the restaurant.\n\nCheck out my other reviews: http://count4food.blogspot.com/\nCheck out my other reviews:"

Let me tell you, I've never tasted anything more amazing in my life. It was rich, but not too overwhelming. A perfect dessert to top off an amazing meal!\n\nI did try some of my husbands dessert too (how could I NOT???) He got the sticky toffee pudding. THIS was the dessert of all desserts. I still have dreams about it :p\n\nI know that I will probably never have a meal like this again! Or at least not for a very long time! I don't have anything bad to say. From the service to the food, to the atmosphere, everything was impeccable!!!"

The beef wellington was as excellent as what I saw on the GR's TV shows.  My mom got the chicken.  We all tried it and it was possibly the best chicken we've ever tasted.  It was moist and flavorful.  My husband had a steak that was also perfectly cooked and tender.\n\nThe lack of a 5th star is due to one issue with the service.  The waiter we had only talked to my husband.  He completely ignored my mom and me.  I asked a question and he just walked off.  He wouldn't even look at us.  It was quite annoying.  When he came around with the meat cart (another thing that looked a bit cheesy as that poor cart if being pushed around all night), he finally decided we existed.  At that point, it got a bit better which saved him from me requesting another waiter/waitress.  Also, after the initial order, other people came to our table to clear our plates, present the dessert menu, etc and they were all really pleasant.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the sticky pudding as recommended by someone else on the staff...  It was delicious!"

All of us are regularly eating out in relatively expensive restaurants and love a good meal, consisting of both food and service. \n\nHere the service and more importantly the reaction of management was just miserable.  We arrived during the dinner rush (on a Wednesday night) with a reservation and were seated promptly after just a five minute wait.  The waiter did his best to upsell everything and we did order appetizers, steaks or chops, and several sides along with a round of drinks.  \n\nAppetizers arrived within 10 minutes of ordering and were quite tasty, hence the one star.  Subsequently we waited an hour an a half for main courses.  We complained and management apologized that the kitchen was really backed up. I guess that part of the concept was to test the \"Hells Kitchen\" reaction of guests getting fed up and just walking, which we almost did.  Management appeared again and when we suggested that the least they could do was offer up a round of drinks on the house he said no but that dessert was on him.\n\nEventually the main course arrived and while the food was really well prepared, actually one of the best steaks I've eaten in a long time.  Unfortunately we had lost our appetites.  \n\nAfter the main course, the waiter never offered a dessert menu, rather delivered three desserts for the table of six with a bunch of forks, without asking if anyone wanted coffee or tea either.\n\nDining is not just about the food delivered but about the total experience.  Unfortunately, this place may have the best food I'll never return for because of the miserable service and management.  I strongly suggest you stay away."

I ate too much bread, ordered the sparkling water, ordered an appetizer, ordered 2 sides with my huge ribeye, a cocktail, and dessert. The second time, I did everything much better. I ate one bite of each bread, ordered still water, split a side of fingerling potatoes with my 8 oz Wagyu rib cap, ordered one appetizer, and split a dessert. The first time, I was trying to not have the zipper on my dress break open. The second time, my pants were only snug. Ok, I maybe had to let my belt out a notch... \n\nThe bread here deserves its own nod. They give you a plate with 6 bites of bread, each one a different amazing flavor. My favorite was the roll with pancetta. So flaky and buttery with a hint of salt.\n\nOne of the main reasons I come here is to get Foie Gras. I can't even begin to describe their amazing presentation and preparation of this controversial dish. Ironically they use Hudson Valley Foie Gras, which is from California. Eating this is definitely a must try if you've never had it. \n\nI ordered medium rare both times and the meat was cooked to perfection. Crisp char on the outside, juicy center. Brought out at the right eating temperature, not too hot or too cold. I highly recommend the Wagyu, which is excellent in it's own right. Not as massive as the ribeye that I couldn't finish anyway, but the marbling of fat was thorough and even. \n\nHighly recommend the sticky toffee pudding as well. A rich, flavorful dessert meant for 2. I am in love with the butter ice cream that comes with this treat. \n\nThe decor is hip and trendy. The service is excellent. Ask whatever questions you want. Don't be intimidated by the hostesses between you and the door. They have nothing to do with you after they seat you. You don't even need to interact with them much to get inside, just make an open table reservation."

I had the stuffed baked potato and it was terrible.  The skin was so hard that it must've been cooked hours before and then microwaved before being served to me.  The cheese sauce was overly sweet and tasted a bit off.  The tempura green beans were bland.   \n\nThere was nothing wrong with the steak, but it just didn't wow me.  I've had better steaks at home.  When I'm in Vegas, I go to Del Friscos.  Their steaks are always amazing!\n\nLastly, I do not appreciate being told how to eat.  Two people in our party wanted to try the tasting menu, but we were told that either the whole table needed to order it or no one could.  That is ridiculous.  I am a paying customer, and I should be able to eat what I would like, when I would like.  Nicer restaurants should be more accommodating and have the ability to prepare different plates for each customer."

The friendly hostess', the immediate seating and the small tour was a great way to begin.\n\nOur server, Charles, knew what he was doing and it showed, he was extremely knowledgeable. Since it was our first time, he took us under his wing and guided us through the Ramsey experience. \n\nLet me start by saying, we ordered 3 plates of the bread THEEE plates (there were only two of us!) the truffle muffin and I think the other muffin was a bacon one, those were the bomb, but also, the fig bread. It was all too good.\nFor our meal, we started with the bleu cheese salad. Nothing to write home about, it was just ok, but a nice start. \nWe then ordered 4 oz of the Kobe beef.... Holy hell, I wish there was more. It was so tender and so full of rich, robust, saltyness flavor. The side of wasabi and lime added a nice touch, but of course the meat was wonderful without.\nFor our main dishes, I ordered the Ribeye and added 3oz of black truffles. The steak was so rich, tender and juicy. It was charred on the outside, like a little crunchy and then soft and tender on the inside. Of course, I always order my steaks medium rare and this steak was cooked perfectly. The only thing I would change is to opt out on the black truffles. It did look like they were sitting on the steak (and under the heat lamp for a while) they had definitely been sitting and I could tell by how wilted they looked on the steak. Not just that, but the truffle just made the steak too much, like it was too rich and the steak was wonderful on it's own.\nWe also ordered the Mac n cheese (I would love more please!) asparagus and the baked potato that they split for us! (Such a thoughtful gesture) it was topped with a cheese sauce and bacon. It was gone within 1 minute of hitting the table and I'm not embarrassed to tell you..\nWe ended the night with two espressos and it came with these adorable chocolate spoons that we stirred into the coffee. \nWe had such a wonderful experience, we can't wait to come back!"

As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Saturday afternoon we had reservations for opening at 4:30pm. We arrived rather early and while waiting is never fun, we were able to pass the time with some gambling and thanks to the friendly hostess  grab a picture next to the ironic GR Steak sign. I was very impressed when the hostess even took a min to wish my wife and I a happy anniversary. Apparently she saw the notes on the reservation. We were promptly seated at 430, and immediately introduced to our server Adrian. Adrian also congratulated us on our anniversary and after finding out it was our first time, he immediately provided some guidance and suggestions. As huge GR fans we have been dying to try the famous beef wellington however thanks to Adrian's suggestion we also gave the Ribcap a try. While we were waiting for our meal we were also greeted by one of the managers. I did not catch his name, however he had a New Zealand/Australian accent. In addition to the hostess and Adrian he also thanked us for our business and wished us a happy anniversary. Both my wife and I were shocked and it truly made us feel special. In one of the nicest restaurants on the Las Vegas strip during a busy dinner service we were congratulated by three different members of the staff. \nIn addition to the beef wellington and ripcap we also had the pleasure of enjoying a pair of caesar salads, the macaroni and cheese, and the fingerling potatoes. All were cooked/prepared to perfection! The best part, through out our meal the quality of service never dropped. Both Adrian and the young man assisting him with water and what not, were consistently checking in and ensure all our needs were met. Once we were finished with our meal, I had no intentions on ordering desert but thanks to Adrian I chose to give the sticky toffee a try. If you are planning a trip to Steak, I strongly suggest everything we ordered! And I especially suggest asking if Adrian is working, the level of service he provided was impeccable and truly elevated our dinning experience to the next level. Thanks to Adrian and his coworkers when I tell my friends about my trip to Steak, not only will I be telling them about our delicious meal, but I will also be telling them how great the service was, from start to finish!"

If you buy a Wellington then you can get a second Wellington for almost 1/3 off. I thought that was strange but then I found out why. You only get 1/2 a Wellington!  So they make a 12oz Filet but your portion is only 6oz. In the end though, 6oz was plenty and we did not walk out hungry!\n\nWe started with a round of drinks...and they are not cheap! Our server, Jonel and her assistant Devon, were fantastic. They start you with some bread and butter but it's not your typical Outback stuff. They are a variety wild little bites of flavor infusion! Ultimately we had 3 plates worth it was that good. When you order the Wellington you have to wait 45 minutes so I ordered a second drink before dinner. We ordered up two sides. Mac n Cheese and Fingerling Potatoes. Right on time came the Wellington. It was buttery, and tender and packed with flavor. The fingerling potatoes were amazing and the mac n cheese was really good as well.  By the time we finished our Wellingtons, sides and bread, well we were pretty satisfied.\n\nWe decided to share the Sticky Toffee Pudding for desert and wow, wow, wow. What a great choice. The desert is moist and delicious. It gets smothered in hot caramel. I mean drenched. If you don't like caramel, well you probably should skip this one but otherwise...mmmm.\n\nThe bill came and it was every bit as expensive as I imagined but we both left with full bellies from amazing food, had great service, and a great time.  ALl 2 1/2 hours worth!  Well worth it for a one time adventure."

Lucky for us, the hubby and I went with our friend who used to work with the executive chef, Kevin Hee, at a previous job. So, he graciously sent our table extra appetizers!\n\nAll of the appetizers we had were great! The hamachi crudo was amazing! I loved the Iberico ham gelee and the caviar and truffle were an extra nice touch! The fried oysters had great texture! Just enough batter to oyster. Loved how they presented the oysters in the original shell! The kurobuta pork belly was so tender and flavorful! \n\nThe best appetizer of them all was the FOIE GRAS. *drool* I miss foie gras in California, so being able to eat this was a treat! So buttery and I loved the sweetness of the huckleberry with the salty foie. \n\nThe hubby and I shared the beef wellington as our main dish. It was cooked just right! The filet mignon was super tender. I loved the pastry dough on the outside. Don't forget to soak up the red wine demi glace with it! Just be careful though, the combination of the sauce and pastry dough make the steak slide around when you're trying to cut it. \n\nWe accompanied our steak with sauteed mushrooms and green been tempura. The mushrooms were good. The bonito flakes made it interesting. The green beans were nice because they were still really bright green and crispy even though they were fried. Great with the garlic aioli it came with!\n\nWe were sooooooo full after all of this. I almost skipped dessert. But I took one look at the menu and I just couldn't resist...\n\nSTICKY. TOFFEE. PUDDING.\n\nThis dessert is miiiiind blowing! From the second it touches your tongue, it's like BAM! Sweet pudding cake smothered with brown butter toffee. OH. EM. GEE. And don't forget the brown butter ice cream! SO GOOD! You will instantly make room in your stomach for this heavenly treat. You MUST get this dessert no matter how full you are!!\n\nI had a great experience here! I would come back to just chow down on appetizers and that amaaaazing sticky toffee pudding!\n\nBy the way, sign up for a Total Rewards membership.

The portions were a touch smaller than I expected but with 5 courses no one left hungry. The amuse Bouche was a scotch egg that was delicate and tasty. The beet salad with creamy burratta was salty and tangy and perfectly balanced. The Scallop pea risotto was the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. Fresh buttery tender scallops and green spring peas. The beef Wellington was excellent but surprisingly not as exciting as the risotto. The bottom line....this food is crazy overpriced but you are paying for the popularity of Gordon Ramsay. The food will be great, you'll get an autographed photo, you'll feel the experience....you'll just pray you hit it big in the casino afterwards."

I thought it was OK by bf liked them more than I did. There was something in that dish that I wasn't sure what it was. I think it was a mushroom but it was very chewy.\nWhat made this meal was the rib cap steak, it was way better than the porterhouse! It was seasoned perfectly and cooked just the way I asked, med. I also love their fingerling potatoes here. Some of them are fried I think and some are roasted, so I enjoy the different textures.  The asparagus has pesto so those are always good. The mushrooms were just OK as well as the peppercorn sauce. My bf loved both though.\n\nWhat made the meal was dessert! I had the peanut butter chocolate dessert; however, what was brought was the bread pudding. This time the wrong order was left on the table for us to enjoy and they still brought the correct dessert.

Steve, the Sommelier is the best.  He has helped us the couple of times we have been there and each time, he has picked the perfect wine pairing. Please do not be afraid to talk with him, tell him what you want and your price range.   I had the short rib, hubby had the Kobe beef, with a red zin pairing.  It was perfect!!!  We topped the evening off with sticky toffee pudding, which I wish I had now.  Even if you just go in and make an event out of having the sticky toffee pudding, it needs to be done."

My brother and I both ordered the short ribs and the first bite was decent but it really is all you can do to finish it. The sauce was very bitter over time and almost had a burnt quality. \n\nMy brother woke up in the middle of the night vomiting and spent the last day of the trip in bed. I had a terribly upset stomach for days even after arriving home. \n\nIt's got a good location but there are a lot of things this restaurant needs for five stars. The food used to be incredible but it seems either Gordon hasn't been here in quite some time or they were having a very off night. The pork belly appetizer was the same description as the previous time we ordered it but it was nearly unrecognizable. \n\nTwo out of three of our experiences here were unpleasant. I just cannot in good conscience recommend it when there are so many other places in Vegas where you could eat."

Maybe because it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant the staff is supposed to be aloof and not very accommodating- taking on Gordon's television personality of hard-ass, but we were not impressed and aren't likely to go back, we'll happily go back to our usual Craftsteak while in Vegas where the food is amazing and service is superb every time.  \nWe sat at the bar and our bartender didn't pour me a taste of the wine I ordered, just poured the glass and walked away, luckily I was happy with it.  The bread selection was great- 1 star for that.  We ordered a filet, bone marrow, spinach & potato puree- all was amazing- 1 star for that.  We let our bartender know we were sharing, apparently he couldn't be bothered to communicate that to the kitchen or runners, the steak was placed in front of my bf, the bone marrow between us and the sides at the top of my bf's setting... not even a warmed plate was left for me- apparently they thought I wasn't eating or was going to eat off of my bf's plate while in a nice dress and he was in a suit... far too likely i would have spilled on us so we asked for an extra plate.  When I've ordered bone marrow at other upper steak restaurants it is served with toasted bread, makes sense right?  Ours was not and when we asked our bartender for some sort of toast or bread he acted annoyed and like we were asking for something ridiculous or out of the ordinary.  \nWe weren't really checked on, we weren't asked if we wanted a second round of drinks, I don't remember being asked if we wanted dessert- everything we ordered was well worth the price because it was delicious, but don't expect friendly, courteous service as being included in the price.\nA week later after we were back home my bf was checking on all of his charges from our trip and was surprised by our lower than our norm total for an upper steak restaurant dinner out- I reminded him we didn't have a friendly, chatty, helpful bartender who cared to find out we are usually 3-4 drinks each diners and we never got the chance for a second round.  \nToo bad for you Gordon Ramsay, your staff didn't pump us for the $$ you could have made off of us."

This year, I was going to fly us out for his birthday and eat here but thank goodness I didn't. I decided to just go when we went to Vegas this year.  We were both pretty damn excited.\n\nI made our reservations at 9:15 which was a little late so we asked if we could go earlier and they seated us at 8:30.  We ordered beef tartare, american wagyu beef sliders, mac and cheese.  I ordered the beef wellington with froie gras and best friend ordered the american wagyu eye.  It took an hour and a half for our main entrees to arrive.  The beef wellington is suppose to take 45  - 50 mins which was fine but it took more than that.\n\nThe food was such a disappointment.

The wagyu beef skirt steak (like most American wagyu, this wasn't real wagyu, but an incredibly close offering) was incredible! The beef Wellington was good except the dough fell off the steak because the knives weren't serrated to cut clean through. They don't do serrated knives because they claim it tears the meat.

I'm disappointed that out of all the restaurants we could have dined in Vegas, I chose Ramsy's steak house for my birthday dinner because I will always remember the cold and unapologetic customer service. Despite this growing franchise, I think it's important that we recognize that we are not at all obligated to dine in restaurants that are infamous from television and pop culture.

We arrived as they opened without a reservation and we were prompted to sit in the lounge area. Ensure you have a reservation. This wasn't a big deal but if you are bringing older guests it could pose a problem because the seats are low to the ground and very small. Anyway, we ordered our food and waited. The wait was normal considering we are expecting perfection. I ordered the 20oz bone in ribeye. I requested medium rare with no char and what I got was medium well with alot of char. The steak was tough and not flavorful at all. Considering this is a steak place owned by Gordan Ramsay, I expected way better. My girlfriend ordered the beef wellington and she really enjoyed it. The sides we ordered were the fingerling potatoes and the asparagus. The potatoes were overcooked and tasted burned also. The asparagus was bland. Nothing about this place was worth the $160 bill besides the service. \n\n\n******** I changed my rating on this review because the manager sent me an apology and invited me back to try this place again.

We went to GR Steak with high expectations, and for a meal for 2 people with (2 entrees, 2 sides, one app w/ no alcohol) and a total bill of over $200 w/ tip, I kinda have to say it would've been nice if our meat had been cooked as we had ordered it and seasoned properly.   I ordered the lamb loins medium, and they arrived medium rare at most, the inside of the loin was really quite raw.  And the lamb pops that came with it - the same - under-seasoned and very dark on the outside, rare on the inside.  \n\nMy fiancee ordered the New York Strip medium rare, and while the outside of the meat was practically charred, the inside was delivered rare and we had to send it back (which we HATE to do, but we just can't eat raw beef to that degree, and frankly for the $$ and prestige of a restaurant like this, we shouldn't have to).\n\nI'll say this - the wait staff was EXCELLENT - and the Bread Plate was ridiculously wonderful:  Walnut & Stilton loaf, a sort of Fig Paste Croissant thing, and a Thyme and Olive Oil Bread with Devonshire Butter w/ Volcanic sea salt.  Tremendous.   Our appetizer of gnocchi was fine - but for $21, I think you should get more than 10 gnocchi's smaller than a quarter each.  And, ya know, some sauce or oil wouldn't hurt.  \n\nThe ambiance was as you'd expect, and I'm not saying I wouldn't eat here again, HOWEVER, I'd really think twice about it as I've paid half as much for better food at other places.  The execution here on the food prep was just way under par for an establishment of this nature, and I can't say I would recommend going here for a \"fail safe amazing meal\".  Unless you're just going for the bread - in that case, run don't walk.   Otherwise - proceed with caution."

Desert was Cheesecake and I can't think of the other one for the life of me but it was ice cream in a shape of a butter stick. I ended with coffee.\n\nSo it started off walking into the restaurant in a red tunnel, sort of like walking into Tao at the Venetian. The tunnel led to the bar area then out to the restaurant. The restaurant reminded me of his show Hells Kitchen. It had a staircase on the right that curved up to the top to an elevator. Reminded me of his finale episodes of his show when the winner would be at the top of the staircase in an elevator or a frosted door. The top dome of the restaurant had red squiggly neon art just hovering in mid air held up by cable or thin steel rods. If you're wondering what that is... it's Chef Ramsays knife trails when he's making his Wellington. Just imagine the tip of his knife with a red LED light and the camera recorded in total darkness at a slow speed to track the light ONLY. These red squiggles are on random items in his restaurant, ie; menu, glass, etc. Before we ordered, we were presented with a steel cart on wheels of different kinds of beef steaks. Kobe, Porterhouse, Ribeye, etc. This cart is what made up my mind on what to order. Bone-in ribeye was a must! The cart was sort of clumsy to some servers because there was a border between the carpet line and the kitchen floor line. The change in flooring is what made the cart shake or bump and steer in a different direction. I knew one day a piece of steak would fall off that thing and sure enough someone made that happen. A huge steel cart clash sound happened and the manager asked the server what happen and he said it's the floors border that bumbed the cart too much. The wheels needed to be bigger and possibly made like a tire on a bike to absorb the jolt off the floor change. I'm sure this will change. Ok, back to food...\n\nI'm not going to go into too much detail on the food because as you can imagine how particular he is on the show, his food has to be awesome and yes it was indeed! Definitely try the Wellington off someones plate if you're not ordering it. The sides come as family style and not on your steaks dish so order plenty for the table but the one side you need to get is the Mac n Cheese. This ain't no Kraft 7 minute microwave crap. Dessert was excellent and presented in a way you wouldn't expect. Butter stick shaped ice cream and a disassembled cheesecake are a couple things that were really cool to see and obviously eat.\n\nServers were well educated on all dishes and you could tell were handpicked to perfection. Apparently each server is teamed up with a right hand man that backed him up. When they brought out the food, they set all plates down at the same time. What I mean by that is that if a table has 4 people, they will have 4 servers around the table and set the plates down. The part that they need to work on was the way they time it. They were standing around the table next to us whispering to each other on who and when will be leading the team to set the plates down. It was obvious and they need to be more descrete about it. Again, this was grand opening night so it was to be expected and should improve as they get use to this. Otherwise the service was fantastic!\n\nOur table location was perfect. We sat against the staircase which we were able to observer the restaurant, kitchen and bar. There were these booth seatings that were shaped like wavey lines. The booth that faced the kitchen seemed private and nice for couples but you can't observe the rest of the restaurant since you're confined to one viewing which is the kitchen. I don't think there is bad seating anywhere other than the ones that face just the kitchen. There's also tables upstairs that overlook the 1st floor. An elevator for food service on the far end left of the restaurant. Nice layout of the restaurant.\n\nThe end of the night it was worth every penny. This would not be a frequent dinning budget for me but for what we spent in the experience, it was well worth it and I can now say I've had Chef Ramsay's Beef Wellington."

However I was disappointed with my first experience because I did not feel the price was worth the quality. \n\nThe goods:\nImpeccable service\nbeef wellington was delicious\nThe ribeye steak that is cut different (I cant remember what he called it)\n\nThe bads:\nTwo of the three steaks did not come out cooked as ordered. My sister ordered medium and got medium rare. Same with her friend. WHen you spend 60 on a steak, that is pretty unacceptable. Half the table had started eating, so they just dealt with the bad steaks. We told the server the dilemma and he offered to refire it. Personally it would have been nice to get a free dessert after something like that. \n\nThe appetizers were also disappointing but I want to try a few other ones next time I go (maybe I just ordered poorly)\n\nI hope my next review on this place is better! I really want to be wowed! As of now, Bobby Flay's restaurant (Mesa Grille at Caesars) dominates Ramsey's steak -house. Sorry Gordon"

Per usual steakhouses are known to not offer anything vegetarian aside from salad and side dishes. But, the salad and a side dish filled me up. They have a lot to choose from and the waiter was very polite and professional and explained everything on the menu while answering questions.

It was top notch from the moment we left Paris, France and stepped into London, England.  The decor is stunning!!  The staff is amazing!!  Matthew was our waiter......what a PHENOMENAL man!! I told him I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and watch all of his shows.  He said they LOVE it when people who come in are fans of Gordon's.  I asked if it would be possible to meet the Chef, and he said it was and he would even give us a tour of the kitchen - it's open so all the guests can see the food prep going on.  After checking with the Chef to see when it would be a good time to come down (yes, our table was UPSTAIRS!! AMAZING!!), he returned after only a few minutes and said that the Chef said now would be a good time for him if it was a good time for us.  Of COURSR it was a good time, are you kidding me??  Lol.  So, we had the tour, met Chef Michael - which was a COMPLETE honor, and he was so gracious and kind, took pictures with us, even had Matthew take a picture of our whole party with him!!  After returning to our table, the Matradee, Joe, came to our table, talked to us, asked if he might make a few suggestions, told us what Gordon Ramsay's and his favorite dishes and cuts of meat are, etc.  I could go on for HOURS!!  Matthew treated us to an appetizer, a dessert AND gave each of us a Gordon Ramsay Steak pen, AND gave me their Hell's Kitchen menu which includes an autographed picture of Chef Ramsay!!!\n\nThank you for making this dream come true experience far more memorable than I could have imagined it to be.  I felt like a Princess for an evening.  This was TRULY magical for me and I can not thank all of you enough for that!!"

The tables were so close together all we saw was the servers butt when he waited on the table next to us. The place was loud and the employees pretentious. Overpriced for what we experienced, and they really push alcohol and special cuts of steak on you, and the American Wagyu was not as good as a filet mignon I've had elsewhere. Our server was intermittently attentive, and for $300 for 2 (including tip) was not worth it. I would not return, instead, for the same price, we had an awesome dinner and service at Bellagio's Prime restaurant. Much better atmosphere, service and food."

Our reservation at GR Steak was for 6:45pm we arrived 5 minutes early and were told the restaurant was running 45 minutes late. Disappointed , but we sat at the bar and waited about 20minutes and were then seated in the restaurant. We chose the GR Limited Edition Tasting menu with the wine pairings . The mushroom risotto with scallop was delicious and the  Beef Wellington was exquisite. The meal was VERY  expensive, with tip it was well over $500 for two. However, the experience , enhanced by our waiter, Dennis, was very memorable. I would have given five stars if the meal had not been so expensive. Nevertheless, great restaurant."

We were greeted at the hostess stand and only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated. There were a few other diners waiting with us that seemed to think shorts, t-shirt and sandals are appropriate for \"business casual\" and I was happy to see the head host approach them about it. I understand that it's 110 degrees in Vegas in the summer, but don't go to a fine steakhouse in your gym clothes people. \n\nAfter we were sat in a quiet room upstairs, we were greeted moment later by our server Shaun, who was delightful and attentive throughout the whole meal. His suggestions were on point and really added to our experience. There were three people in our party and we all decided to try something different and pass a few tastes around the table.\n\nA few comments on the drinks; We started the evening with some cocktails. We tried the Vesper, the Sidecar and a third drink I can't remember off hand. All the drinks were well made and really not all that expensive considering the quality of liquors used. We had a bottle of wine to do with dinner as well. I'm a big fan of Bordeaux, which the wine list had in spades. Both Shaun and the Sommelier had some brilliant suggestions and the wine we ended up getting was excellent at a good price point. The Sommelier knew the encyclopedic wine list like the back of his hand and shared a few interesting facts with us about the particular vineyard we chose. \n\nA few comments on the food; Wow, truly exceptional. The bread service had an interesting spread of choices from a foccacia to brioche which was a real treat. We ordered the pork belly and the gnocchi as an appetizer,both of which were phenomenal. For our entree we ordered the signature beef wellington, the 24oz dry aged ribeye, and a dry aged filet. The Wellington easily lived up the hype and was a favorite at our table. The ribeye was absolutely incredible and cooked to perfection. The filet could have benefited from a sauce in my opinion, and there are several options for that on the menu, we just didn't order anyway. We also ordered the fingerling potatoes, mac and cheese and the creamed corn. All three were excellent, however our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we could not finish them. Despite being stuffed to the gills, we still ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and boy are we glad we did. It was a great cap to an already extraordinary meal. \n\nThe whole experience, start to finish, was a wonderful experience all around. My praises to the entire crew at Steak for running a restaurant worthy of Gordon Ramsay's name. Thank you for the incredible effort and pride you put into your work."

            "review": "My wife and I visited Gordon's steakhouse on our trip to Vegas; both of us are Hell's Kitchen/Masterchef fans, so we were sure there would be some quality dining in store. \nThe staff was very nice when we arrived, and we were seated right away. Although the website stresses business casual, many of the diners were in shorts and Tshirts, which I would have prefered since it was 105 degrees outside. The decor is very nice, modern English, with a \"Chunnel\" to enter through. That's when the problems started, and I started taking stars off of the rating. First issue: the NOISE, as others have also noted, was way to loud. Was it the kitchen or diners causing the din? No, the rock music coming through their speakers caused my wife to proclaim that it felt more like a bar than a restaurant. The staff brought around a steak display for you to choose from, but I couldn't hear a thing he said. Second issue: I didn't care for the I-pad drink menu. I don't understand this technology push in some restaurants, and not having a paper copy to read everything at once was a severe turn-off. It may also have been the reason for the third issue, which was they asked if you wanted water, offering both a sparkling or flat water. The thing they didn't mention was that the water wasn't free, but rather 9 bucks a bottle (see 105 degrees above). That came off as a needless expenditure; just a heads up to bring your Dasani from out on the Strip in with you. Our orders came in about a half hour, which seemed very respectable, and the food kept the rating above two stars. I went with the Wellington, which was tasty and rested on a delicious garnish of potato puree (would have been worth the $12 sides price to add a full helping). The only disappointment was that my steak knife had all the teeth of a butter knife, so cutting my Wellington was a chore as it slipped around the plate. My wife's choice of the American Kobe, on the other hand, didn't need a knife, as it was the best steak I have ever tasted. Her baked potato side was huge, but I didn't find it to be anything I haven't had at numerous other steakhouses. So, here are my ratings: Staff = A, Decor/Atmosphere = C (because of the noise), Food = A"

            "review": "Went here on a Saturday night as an anniversary celebration dinner.  The meals we had here were superb.  From the lovely selection of bread, to our delectable appetizers, we started our meals off right.  I had the lobster with chorizo appetizer ($28), and my husband had the Caesar salad ($17).  The lobster was perfectly cooked and tender.  Strangely enough though, the chorizo was very mild and I couldn't really taste any typical chorizo flavor or spicy heat in it.  Maybe it was a more European version of chorizo?  My husband's Caesar salad came with a Scotch quail egg, which was perfectly crispy on the outside, yet light, with lots of flavor.\n\nWe had the beef Wellington for two ($100), which took some time to get served to us, but it was worth it!  I savored every bite of the beef, packed with flavor, and the flaky pastry crust with mushroom paste covering the inside.  \n\nI decided to try the HK antioxidant cocktail ($14), which was smooth and refreshing.  The flavors were fruity and perfect together.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the meal, service was off.  For such a fine establishment where you are paying a lot of money for your meal I really expect nothing but friendliness and attentiveness from the wait staff.  For the most part, this was true.  However, our main server seemed disinterested and wasn't very friendly throughout the whole meal.  When it came to ordering dessert, we were so stuffed we couldn't possibly eat any more, but really wanted to take something back to the hotel with us for later.  We asked for the sticky toffee pudding to go, and initially our server wouldn't let us order it, because the ice cream would melt, he said.  We told him that we were heading right to our hotel room afterwards and the room had a freezer.  After some discussion, he finally said he could pack it up to go, but without the ice cream.  Once again, our room had a freezer, so the ice cream wouldn't melt, but whatever, we were OK with eating it without ice cream.  Eating it later on, perhaps that ice cream would have helped cut the very sweet nature of the dessert, for it was almost cloyingly sweet for my tastes.\n\nP.S.  If you have a Total Rewards casino card with any Harrah's-owned establishment, they give you a few dollars off each item you order, but if you pay with your rewards points, your total is based on the normal non-discount price."

            "review": "So I follow Gordan Ramsey's shows especially my favorite FWord on the BBC. And Vegas is my home away from home. I also eat at steakhouses just about every month. Definitely on every vacation. So our  anticipation was high. Months reserved and spent waiting and dreaming of Beef Wellington and American Kobe steak.\n \n  Let me start by saying 3 stars is hard I want to put more but I'm struggling. I waited so long then was sooo disappointed. It pains me to even say those words about a Gordan Ramsey restaurant. This is an average for me cause half our evening was awesome and the other half was not so awesome.  \n  \n  So first walking up to restaurant you see everything is going to be big. The sign goes all the way up to the ceiling and has a cool covered entrance. Next thing you notice all the host look the same and not just there attire. They literally all look a like ( creepy) . After being told about a wait , which we anticipated being a new restaurant and of course a Gordan Ramsey restaurant. We were sat in the lounge which has a bunch of tall tables and chairs and a bunch of small tables and chairs. We has a small table. I had trouble finding our waitress cause like i said they all look a like. Here's where things start go wrong on this side of the restaurant. \n I ordered us some drinks ,Oana had one off there list and I ordered my usuall girly drink Vodka, Sprite and Cranberry. Oana's was pretty good but either the bartender or the waitress can't follow direction or read because mine was terrible. First no Cranberry which was clearly on the receipt and was very strong.I love me some Vodka but not straight I'm not Russian. Then after one sip she asks if I'm ready to settle my tab. I have probably 30 minute wait and just sat down. I understand she was just doing her job but it's the way she said it , the tone was rushed and not nice. So after 30 minutes or so , someone comes and says our table is ready. Sweet ,  we get up and she walks us over to the area where all the waitresses pick up drinks , every bar has this little area. And we stand in the way of everyone for about 10 minute before I suggest to my wife we go back to the lounge. We went back and found an open seat and waited about another 5 minutes before they came back and said our table was actually ready. I settled my tab with very small tip. I want to say I can't remember every being treated as poorly in a 5 star restaurant as I was int the lounge of Gordan Ramsey's. \n\n  That all being said here's where it starts being awesome. So finally we were seated in the main  area next the stairs near the kitchen. The eating area was like walking into whole other restaurant the atmosphere to decor and attitude was totally different then the lounge. We were sat in these tall booth like chairs that were totally awesome. The decor I have to say is 5 stars and is amazing.  Our waiter Adrian showed up with a water guy Chris. Everyone who works there is very good looking, no uglies here. Our waiter was very good and very professional. The menu is not cheap which we look up on line so weren't shocked. One of favorite things was the steak display, immaculate. Steaks so beautiful you could eat raw but don't recommend it. Oana went with the Rib eye the most popular one, Kobe American beef. I ordered the Beef Wellington I had been waiting months for. While we were waiting for our beef we started with something basic, Mac n Cheese. Which was very good, not 5 star good but still good. Next our main course came out. Let me tell you that my Wellington was worth every penny and every minute I spent waited for. Oana's steak was literally mouth watering and melting all at the same time. Seriously it melted in our mouths with out even chewing. I love some Elway's in Denver but this was the Best steak we had ever eaten. And I've eaten my share of steak across the USA. It made up  for the shitty treatment we got in the lounge. It gets even better. we tried Gordan's famous Sticky Pudding ( ice-cream shaped like stick of butter, brilliant ) cake served warm, so unbelievably delicious.  And a topper to a beautiful and painful evening.  Once we were done the manager Jenn came over and let me explain our evening Gordan Ramsey style loud and honest. She was very professional and helpful. After talking to her we were no longer upset. Over all our experience was probably 4 stars but I just can't over how different the lounge was run compared to the eating area . \n\n  I will probably go back, we want to take the kids. If I do you can count on me calling Jenn ahead of time like she suggested. If you got a couple hundred bucks to spare I highly recommend this steakhouse or just to say you ate there. Either way the decor alone is worth a visit. Now Fuck off. Kidding"

Happened to be in vegas for a special anniversary dinner and let me tell you it was AMAZING. Possibly the best meal I have ever had in my life and the best customer service EVER! \n\nWhen you walk up to the restaurant you think, hm nice. Then you walk further in and you're in the \"chunnel\" which your hostess immediately tells you that Ramsay wanted to imitate the tunnel which trains go through under the English Channel, then next thing you know you're just in this hip and classy atmosphere. She tells you to look up at this sort of array of scribbly lines above you in the ceiling which is basically art work to show you Ramsay's hand movements to his famous making of the Beef Wellington AWESOOOMMMEEEE!! Yes, especially when you're BIG HK fans! Anyways...\n\nOur waiter was very helpful and so informative of everything on the menu and answered all of our questions perfectly! I even liked the little meat cart which he brought to further emphasize the difference and the reason why they provided the best meats all around! They even have this little ipad which they sit on the side of you for further ordering. \n\nWe started off with their complimentary breads which was a variety of oh so yummy goodness  I remember one of the breads had prosciutto baked into it and omg it was delish reminded me of being in Italy plus they had the butter imported especially from England. I had Meiomi Pinot Noir as the waiter ha suggested to pair with my main course which he said \"was from Sonoma which the grapes were especially handpicked one by one to get that special taste\" idk something fancy shmancy but the point was our waiter was informative even to the littlest thing such as our butter imported from England to the type of wine I was drinking! The boyfriend had the HK antioxident because of everybody suggesting it on yelp and well, everybody was right! It is most definitely a must have for a cocktail!\n\nFor the main course the boyfriend had a 24 oz Bone-in Rib Eye and it was huuuuuuge and the meat was sooooo tender to die for! And I had the infamous BEEF WELLINGTON! You know if you've watched Hell's Kitchen then you are so curious to why Ramsay is just on the chefs like crazy for getting the perfect wellington out and once you take a bite out of the wellington you know exactly why it has to be PERFECT! Like I said....this was the best meal of my life. Ha, oh and did i mention the side of bone marrow that was just soooooo goooooooood!\n\nDessert was BOMB DOT COM. We got the sticky toffee everybody raved about on yelp and boy did we do the right thing! Our waiter even said that their pastry chef won the best pastry chef in the whole U.S. and gee, can everybody just give him a round of applause, stand ovation because he deserves it!\n\nIf you are ever in vegas, will be going to vegas? Make reservations it is beyond worth it...\n\nAnd did i mention that Christina last HK season chef winner was literally a couple feet away from us! AHHHHHHH (:"

When ordering they did not ask how u wanted the steaks cooked. My table told them; however most steaks were brought to us 'rare' at best.  I usually never send food back, however this time I had to.  Our host was served tuna when he had ordered salmon.  Tuna was not even an option on the fixed menu they provided. We had at least 1/3 of the group who sent their food back. 15 min later they give me a steak that is cut in half of which one half is burnt and the other half is still rare.  I was sure this was someone else's steak. When they brought the mashed potatoes they were liquid. The 2nd time around they brought fingerling potatoes. I ended up finding a big chunk of steak mixed in with the fingerling potatoes. At this point, and 3 hours later, We were done with this place and did not stick around for dessert."

The food had turned from amazing to average . The service is always impeccable and the manager was very nice to swap our order, but even the second choice it was still avarage.\nI order steak tartare everywhere and nobody in Europe would ever ever serve ot with chips instead of toasted bread.\nI think Gordon needs to come back soon!!!!!!"

            "review": "I have watched so many shows of Gordon Ramsay. We decided to try it. A party of five got seated in a table of four. Three plates on one side versus two plates on the other. I don't think I have ever been seated in such a cramped position even in no name restaurants. It also is incredibly loud. You have to shout to be heard even a feet apart.\n\nThen the waitress started telling me that the red artwork of neon's hanging from ceiling is Gordon Ramsay's hand movements during cooking. I would call that pretentious but I don't care. Looking around, I have seen the tables next to each other barely a feet apart. Definitely crowded in.\n\nOnce the waitress has left, we were served bread and butter. Can't say it was special. It was volcanic salt and butter. The salt was too strong and the breads did not have any special flavor that you cannot find anywhere else.\n\nMy wife ordered a wine but the wine ran out while the waiter was filling her glass. I think it barely covered the bottom of the glass. Did he come back put more ? No, that must be how you get treated in Gordon Ramsay steak house.\n\nThe salad and scotch egg were good. It was a little too much oil on the lettuce but the taste was good.\n\nNext we were told,if we wanted to order Beef Wellington, it will be served medium rare; no exceptions. I could not help but touch my beef wellington and it was barely warm. I remembered Gordon Ramsay yelling chefs that beef wellington is not cooked. First time, so I decided to try it and give it a chance. It was very good but more on that later. \n\nThe steak my father in law has ordered as well done, has been butterflied. The waitress has asked if they can butterfly and he said, if you must. They did.  I thought this was a no-no for a top steak restaurant. Baked potatoes we ordered, were nothing special.I have to rate them below average for the taste.\n\n When food was finished, all the party of five wanted to get out of this cramped place and we did.\n\nBeef wellington, medium rare, well I was sick the whole night and stayed up. If I were you, I would stay well clear of that place. It is a joke. I have eaten in places less expensive but better steaks. My wife told me this was not the best steak she had eaten. I agree even though it was one of more expensive steak houses we have been to. \n\nOne parting thing, there is no dress code, you can come and eat in flip flops but it made me feel like a fool to put on a nice suite. Did I mention, the waitress argued with my father in law about the dress code for five minutes. Hmm, not the best customer service either."

            "review": "This steakhouse was absolutely outstanding.  It started off with the hostess explaining to us about the decor and then our wait staff (Mike White and Sean Cudahy) were very attentive and helpful with food choices.  The Fried Blue Point Oysters were a great appetizer and I would order more great food instead of filling up on the delicious bread.  The caesar salad tasted like a great balance of flavors, not sure if they will put more garlic or anchovies on for you, but we thought it was good with out over loading the flavors, like at home.  I suggest ordering the Kobe American Filet, because of the tasty crust and perfectly done inside of the steak from the start of the meal to the last bite.  The Beef Wellington was good, but I preferred the Kobe fillet for the pure taste of the meat.  The only thing better if you have room is the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert and it pairs well with several wine choices.  We were impressed with the wine because it had many of our personnel favorites, consult the sommelier because he was very good at pairing to enhance the experience."

            "review": "We've been here twice now, and both times GR Steak has excelled. There's a lot of great stuff going on, and only so much stomach-space (and so much wallet-room -- no denying this place is expensive) -- we haven't really had time to explore what looks to be a fantastic cocktail menu, for example. The decor is hip and modern, with a cool artpiece occupying the center-ceiling of the main dining room. There is also a quieter private area upstairs for larger parties (we've eaten in both spots).\n\nService has been consistently great. This last time we went, we asked what went into the beef wellington, and were informed one of the components was prosciutto. Since we don't eat pork, that was out -- but the waiter helpfully told us that they could prepare a beef wellington without the prosciutto if it's called in advance (we'll take advantage of that next time). Moreover, now on alert to us not eating pork, he caught that the Caesar Salad we ordered had a scotch egg in it (with pork) and made sure to nix it (we had missed that). So much respect to him.\n\nSoup and salad appetizers are good, though nothing truly exceptional. The sides are likewise not extraordinary, although the size of the baked potato might cause a few jaws to drop. Even split in half (which the waiter again offered to do without prompting) it was still more than enough for the two of us. But where GR Steak excels is, appropriately enough, the steaks. I have yet to see a steak here that was not perfectly cooked -- the first filet I ever ordered at GR Steak was literally the platonic ideal of medium rare. Truly delicious. This time I decided to splurge and try the wagyu beef filet, which was a delight (though I'm not 100% convinced its worth the price bump over their also-brilliant \"regular\" prime filet).\n\nTheir signature dessert is a Sticky Toffee Pudding served with brown butter ice cream. Maybe that sounds delicious to you, maybe it doesn't. Don't care -- order it regardless. It's unbelievable. We didn't have room for dessert this last time we went, so we're going to try to head in early the night we're leaving Vegas just so we can order this dish.\n\nGR Steak is expensive, but it makes a great splurge or celebration spot. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Wanting to sample this celebrity chef establishment prior to committing to breaking the bank in the main dining room, we were excited to learn that they had a bar menu. However, unlike most bar menus, the unfortunate reality was there were no discounts on theirs. In fact the only difference with the main menu was the presence of a half portion of fish & chips ($24) and a kobe burger ($21). Before you go, make sure you have a Total Rewards card because that saves you anywhere from a buck to a few bucks per item. Besides the aforementioned items, we also ordered the short rib tortellini with scallops ($19), foie gras ($25), and melon panna cotta ($12).\n\nWe were unlucky to be saddled with a wonky server and sat at one of the last remaining, tiny, and round bar tables. What do I mean by wonky? First off, it took more than several minutes for the waitress to even come by and acknowledge me. She asked if I was just waiting for a table in the dining room or dining in the lounge. It took more than another 5 minutes for her to bring menus and glasses of water. When we realized that she only brought us the regular dining menus, we finally managed to flag her down after another 5 minutes to ask to see the bar menu. She replied that the only difference was the half portion of fish & chips and kobe burger and for some reason was resistant to bringing the requested bar menu. We politely insisted that we would still like to actually see the bar menu, and she reluctantly complied. WTH? Really? We were envious of other tables which appeared to have MUCH more efficient and courteous wait staff.\n\nFor a party of 3, our table was WAY too small. I would even argue that it was inadequate for a party of 2, unless you were only having cocktails. When the 4 dishes arrived, they had to remove all of our small individual dining plates and bread plates, and even then there was barely enough room to fit just those 4 plates on the table. Good thing we don't mind dining intimate family style.\n\nJust a quick note about the bread, it consisted of 1 pancetta bread, 2 truffle brioche, 3 foccacia, and 3 walnut bread. The first 2 were our faves, but it was kind of odd that they didn't provide 3 pieces of each type of bread so that we didn't have to cut the pancetta and truffle breads amongst the 3 of us.\n\nMoving on to the food, the fish & chips was tasty loup de mer but only consisted of 3 small pieces and about 10 McDonald's style french fries. The creme fraiche tartar sauce was decent but McDonald's tartar (the gold-standard IMHO but a topic for another discussion) is a lot better. The Kobe burger was tasty and succulent but didn't come with any fries or sides. The short rib tortellini was decent but only came with 4 pieces and the 4 scallops on the side were miniscule. By comparison, the foie gras was the stand out savory dish. The seared preparation was generously portioned, although the paired accompaniments lacked the acidity needed to balance its rich succulence. Finally, the melon panna cotta dessert was delicious, but the portion size was about 1/3rd what we would have expected. For the same $12 price, we would prefer Scarpetta's version for quality and quantity.\n\nIn summary, the food was delicious, but the small serving sizes make the high prices hard to justify even for a Strip restaurant. How expensive could it be to give you more than 10 fries and 2 to 3 more small pieces of fish? How about 2 to 4 more tortellini? How about some fries with your $21 bar menu burger? And while we're at it, let's double or triple the size of the panna cotta. This restaurant could easily merit 4 stars, but the poor value and wonky service knock it down to 3 stars."

From the moment I arrived, I was instantly put off by the place but my boyfriend seemed to actually be excited to dine there (he loves Gordon Ramsey for some weird reason) that I didn't hesitate and dined anyway(it was his birthday, and also our anniversary).\n\nHostesses were nice. They asked if we had dined before and gave a brief overview of the place, for example how the red \"tunnel\" we passed through entering the restaurant was apparantly the \"transition\" from Vegas to England...okay. And the cluster of lights on the ceiling were Ramsey's hand movements as he made the Beef Wellington. The ambience felt very \"club\"- like and super casual....definitely not an ambience I want if I'm spending Benjamin's on a single steak. Hostess led us to a nice table on the second floor and handed us our linen. Nice touch. \n\nOur server came over and was very nice and sort of informative. However, there was absolutely nothing on the menu that caught my eye. My boyfriend ended up ordering the oysters for appetizers and apparently was the one good thing throught the whole experience. However, no one seemed to acknowledge we were celebrating both a birthday and an anniversary. \n\nI ordered the beef Wellington. Most. Bland. Thing. Ever. It had no taste at all but because I was THAT hungry, I ate it all. My boyfriend had the filet and he thought the same of his entree, super bland. Nothing special. In fact I believe we would've gotten better steaks at Norms.  Our busser even seemed offended that I asked for more bread....as that was really the only thing I enjoyed and was APALLED when I asked for ice for my water. \n\nNever once did a manager stop by our table either to ask how we were doing. If it wasn't for our server being super nice I wouldn't have even left a tip. It was the single most worst dining experience I have had. For a $250 meal for two I expect fine quality but what I got was diner quality. \n\nDon't waste your time here. If it wasn't for the fact that we had watched Jersey Boys before dinner, the night would have been a complete disaster for me. I'd rather watch Jersey Boys back-to-back-to-back than to dine at this establishment again. I already made my reservations for Carnevino for my next Vegas visit in February."

My bf and I decide to get oysters for starters, for entree we got the beef wellington for 2 and 2 cocktail drinks. I got the HK antioxidant and he got the drifter. \n\nAnother server (I forgot his name I think Eric?) he brought us out bread to start off.. It was really delicious.. There was a focaccia bread with olive oil drizzled on top, bacon bread, and cinnamon raisin swirl. All were very good then comes the oysters!!! (My favorite) it was so fresh and sweet.. \n\nOur beef Wellington came and it was so delicious! The meat was cooked to perfection. Meat just melted in your mouth and the pastry on the outside was buttery and flaky.\n\nAs for our dessert.. We just had to go with the famous sticky toffee pudding that they are known for.. And OMG it was GOOD! As the waiter drizzled the Caramel sauce over the cake... I felt the tears coming out of my eyes... As I dived in with the first bite.. It felt like love as first bite. The cake was so moist and had the right amount of sweetness.. Then I sliced a piece of ice cream (ice cream look like a stick of butter with a knife on it) it was heaven!! It was a party in my mouth. \n\nOverall I had a really good experience.. This will not be my last visit.. Everyone is super friendly and nice. I will definitely come back soon! I'm looking forward to trying out the tasting menu another time."

            "review": "Saturday night (8/4/12), dinner time:\n\nI had read several reviews of Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant at Paris before dining there.  One thing people talked about was the unique entranceway into the restaurant, designed to emulate the Chunnel from France into England.  It was interesting but best to appreciate it before you walk in since before the hostess can even finish telling you what the entrance represents, you are already through it and into the bar area.  The bar is separated from the two storied restaurant by a glass wall.  The ground floor eating area is adjacent to an open kitchen which allows the smell of the cooking steaks to permeate the restaurant.  There is a long flight of stairs against one wall leading to a second eating area on the balcony overlooking the restaurant.  After you sit down and take in the surroundings, you being to realize just how loud and blaring the background music is.  You can hardly hear the waiter not to mention the people sitting across the table from you.  I guess the overly loud music is supposed to give an energy to the place but it is too overdone and passes well into the annoying range.\n\nWe started with a half dozen west coast oysters ($20) and a heirloom tomato salad ($18). The oysters were very fresh and come with a trio of sauces: vinaigrette, soy sauce and a traditional red cocktail sauce.  The tomato salad was a medley of sweet tomatoes, prosciutto and watercress.  Both simply presented dishes were very well done.  \n\nFor the second course, we had the asparagus soup ($17) and lobster bisque ($26).  The asparagus soup was served over a central mound of Dungeness crab, celery and smoked salmon caviar.  The soup had a rich asparagus flavor and the subtle crab meat blended well with it.  However, when you were unfortunate enough to bite into one of the cheap orange caviar pearls, the taste was ruined but this intense fishy flavor filling your mouth.  I do like unique combinations of flavor but these tastes did not mesh well at all.  The lobster bisque was served with a whole portion of shelled lobster tail meat sitting in a very flavorful brown lobster broth.  The meat was buttery and perfectly cooked. Clearly, this was a well thought out dish and earned the high recommendation the waiter gave it when suggesting entrees.\n\nFor dinner, we had the roasted Beef Wellington (one of Gordon's signature dishes at $52) and the fish and chips ($42).  The Wellington was served already sliced down the middle on a layer of very creamy mashed potatoes.  There were puddles of a dark brown, very salty demi-glace splashed around the dish and a small pile of glazed root vegetables.  Overall, the dish was good however not one to order if you like your meat well done.  As it is, I like my meat medium rare so the very pink interior didn't bother me.  The fish and chips however were a greasy mess.  The fish filets are served breaded and fried with their tails on.  The two filets are plated on top of several large dollops of tarter sauce.  The dish comes with a small side of truffle oil fries.  The first thing you notice however is the somewhat unappetizing fishy smell.  I'm sure the fish was fresh (it better be for $42) so perhaps they are reusing the oil to fry batch after batch.  I suppose it is somewhat ironic to complain that a fish dish smelled fishy but it was unappetizing to have your food smell like an old fisherman's net.  When you cut into the fish, the next thing you notice is the oil pouring out around your knife and fork.  Combined with the creamy tarter sauce, this is a heavy, heavy greasy dish.  It tastes all-right but it will sit on your belly for the rest of the night.  If you have plans later, it is probably best to avoid this particular entree.\n\nFor desert, we had the sticky toffee pudding ($13), a small French pressed coffee ($8) and a double espresso ($8).  The pudding is served along side of a small cup filled with extra molten toffee to pour over the pudding and a rectangular block of butter flavored ice cream, made to look like a stick of butter.  Unfortunately, there was so much butter in the ice cream, it also tasted like a cold stick of butter.  The pudding was very sweet, almost too sweet, such that after a few bites, you feel like you need an injection of insulin.  The whole dish is gaudy, in-your-face butter and sugar.  We stopped eating it after a few bites.\n\nThe waiter did a good job and came by often during the meal.  However, you can only hear half of what they are saying to you due to the excessively loud music. It was amusing to look around and see different waiters around the restaurant leaning in to repeat things to other diners.  Doesn't the manager also notice things like this? Overall, the food was ok but was certainly not worth the excessive price tag.  You are basically paying extra for the name and hoping the food lives up to the reputation.  Unfortunately, the entire experience falls short."

A waiter turns from another table and taps on our table and says \"I will be right there.\"   So we sat for 15 minutes with no menu, no beverages, and a fully staffed restaurant and were basically ignored.  I couldn't take it anymore so I had to get a different waiter from the other tables to help us.  The guy was great and very knowledgeable.  30 minutes later our original waiter comes by during our appetizers and did the meat cut showing.  He says it's part of the experience of being there.  So I guess the experience is ignore your customers, show me raw meat during my eating and show me cuts of meats after I have already ordered.  Then came the biggest disappointment of the night, my rib eye boned in piece of leather.  The meat was so tough, you have to saw into it just to eat.  I never sawed into a medium rare steak ever in my life.  I asked for a sharper knife but they only carried cerrated butter knives at this steak house.  I do recommend the coffee, it was excellent.  Dinner for two $350 bill for good coffee.  By the way, the beef Wellington, the crust is supposed to be flaky not soggy.  Will not recommend or return to this place.  For a guy that prides on running a restaurant correctly, this was such a failed experience."

I had a Kobe cut of steak that was the outer portion of the ribeye, one of the best steaks I have ever had, and I tend to eat at very high end steak houses.  My boyfriend had the bone in ribeye, and he enjoyed it immensely.  We had a black truffle risotto, fingerling potatoes, the toffee pudding and three delicious cocktails. I would recommend this place if you have $350 + to spend on a wonderful mouthwatering meal and perfect dining experience.\n\nNext time perhaps we will partake in the chef's tasting menu."

            "review": "\"I'm so glad we did this, baby,\" are the words my husband said as we were leaving the Paris after celebrating our anniversary here. We did not order appetizers but we enjoyed the variety of breads offered to us. The wine selection is significant and they can make any cocktail you would like. My husband had the Beef Wellington and I had the bone-in rib eye. Both were cooked to perfection. I ordered my steak medium plus. It was very tender and perfectly seasoned. I think it's the best steak I've had!The beef Wellington comes medium rare and can be cut with a butter knife! It definitely exceeded our expectations. The fingerling potatoes were a bit garlicky but the Mac and Cheese was excellent. We ordered coffee with desert and that was an event! The coffee is made with a French press and comes with \"ABC\" spoons. The spoons are covered in chocolate and each contains a liquor ... Amaretto, Baileys, and a Cordial (raspberry). We had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding cake and brown butter ice cream after reading the reviews. All I can say is \"Wow!!\" It was delicious!! This can definitely be shared. Our server was Lomberto and Ryan was helping. They were extremely attentive! Whatever we wanted, Lomberto would make it happen. He really helped to make this a memorable experience. \nI highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak if you're in Vegas. If you're local ... You gotta give it a try!!"

Definitely up to par with renown restaurants in Vegas. \n\nI went with my wife and decided to split every portion in two. Presentation was flawless.  Ordered beet salad, Kobe sliders, and the infamous beef Wellington with a side of garlic mushrooms. \n\nA pleasant surprise was the beet salad. so simple and yet flavorful, that it was borderline genius. I am tempted to say it was the best part of dinner. \n\nKobe sliders were very nice, nothing mind-blowing. Beef Wellington was great and after all the hype it didn't disappoint. \n\nAs others yelpers have mentioned, assorted bread was very tasty and nicely selected.  \n\nOverall, great experience and food. Being a vegas local, I would definitely return."

I read some of the bad reviews before going, mostly centered around snooty reception,  overcooked or bad steaks and Beef Wellington, and of course the LOUD ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nBut I took my clients here anyway and was seated in the upstairs area.  We had an awesome server,  she took great care of us.  We had the Waygu beef steaks and fillets - which are melt in your mouth amazing.   Great food and wine,  excellent sides and the Sticky Toffee Pudding is to die for.\n\nIt's expensive as hell,  but our experience was worth it.  I would really like to try the Beef Wellington after years of watching Hells Kitchen, but I'm told it takes an hour to cook and the there are enough reviews of bad Wellington experiences at GR that I'm not sure I want to take a chance...we'll see...I'm going again in a few weeks.\n\nBut come on, when you have Waygu beef available,  you do that.   Don't waste your time on the Prime Cuts,  you can get that at any old Ruth's Chris -- Waygu, Kobe and the signature Ramsay stuff is what you eart here.  \n\nOh yeah, it's kind of loud,  but not blaringly so on the second level,  we could talk to each other without yelling."

I can't even find words for how fantastic everything was! I don't even like beets and I ate every bite of that salad! As you eat the risotto you hear Ramsey's voice screaming how a risotto should be cooked and his chefs definitely listened because it was perfect.  The Wellington is always great and I have figured out how to cut it so I get meat and pastry in each bite. And of course that dessert is the best dessert EVER!  If you could only afford one thing here get that, it is so amazing.  Also received bread to start and it took every ounce of control not to eat all 6 pieces. \nService was so good. I wish I could remember their names because they know how to treat a person.\n  Only downside was at my Wellington course a couple was seated next to me and the woman had enough perfume on to choke a horse. I don't understand these women  that bathe in perfume but especially when you are going to dinner and part of the experience is the smell of the food not your bug spray perfume!!"

I have been wanting to come here for months and my girlfriend surprised me today. We were the first to be seated in his area. He asked if we wanted cocktails I responded no since my gf was not in the mood to drink and I was driving. After that came the snobbyness. He asked everyone but us if today was a special occasion with everyone responding no. Yet the one who was there on a special occasion, this guy writing the review, did not get asked until after I asked my neighbors in front of him why they were asked and I wasn't . Then came the fake congratulations from him. It gets better. I ordered the wellington I've been craving since I saw it on the F word a few years ago. It was given to my gf not me and I got her spare ribs. So we had to switch it in front of him and he said I ordered it the other way. I assure you, I did not.  The food was amazing! But ruined by this terrible server. He walked past me 6 times and I repeat 6 times after me and my gf had finished eating our food. Clean plates and all! Staring at him as he walked past me several times until I finally got upset and said \"Look chris, you have walked past us several times and we would like to look at the desert menu.\" He answered back \" oh I thought you were still working on your meal\" he then cleaned our table after awhile and wondered why we decided not to get a desert after all. I just explained you lose your craving after such a long wait. The funny thing is I never thought I would ever write a review on a place and much less a negative review. But I have to say love the food, but the waiter was extremely rude and condescending.  Oh and to anyone who sits in his area if you say no to cocktails be prepared but if you're like my neighbors and ordered cocktails and wines you will get decent service from him. Not sure I would return here, which is upsetting, seeing as how I always rambled on to my gf and friends about Ramsay's shows.  Great job on the food Christina from hell's kitchen. Memorable dinner, too bad for the wrong reasons."

There is a lot of energy going on in the restaurant- it is definitely loud, like other people have mentioned, but it is a lot of fun. Our waiter had been working at Ramsay's since it opened and was very knowledgeable about the menu. The Beef Wellington was everything I hoped it would be, the bread basket is amazing, we also ordered the Fois Gras appetizer and really enjoyed it. Over all, the food was well executed, everything tasted great, and we had a fantastic time.

            "review": "I went to Ramsay Steak with extremely high expectations, and having looked forward to this meal for months. It not only did the seemingly impossible of delivering on my expectations, but surpassed them. \n\nNo matter how excellent a restaurant is you sometimes balk at high end prices. Can an entree really be worth $70? A whole meal $200? The answer is yes - yes it can be worth that and truly more. I had a memory and a life event at Ramsay Steak more than a meal. \n\nFor starters I ordered the foie gras - and it was divine. The play between the rich foie gras, goat cheese pop overs and blue berries was amazing. The tables around me were rightly jealous of my appetizer. They ordered the blue point oysters and were not disappointed either. \n\nFor my main I went with the signature Beef Wellington. The beef was the best I've had - and this was the part of the meal I both had the highest expectations for and had also cooked for myself and others many times. I knew what a great Wellington should be - and mine was amazing. \n\nFor sides I had the blistered shoshito peppers. They were lovely, but I should say if you're eating alone or in a party of two a side is entirely unnecessary and in fact way too much. A side could serve 3 or 4 and between the other courses you don't need it. \n\nFinally, the sticky toffee pudding was a revelation. Hot caramel, brown butter ice cream, and the pudding itself. I was full by the time I got to this but it was so good I wanted to eat another course. My neighbor (a very respectable gentleman headed to a show with his wife) suggested stuffing it in the pocket of his suit he loved it that much. \n\nService was excellent - entirely what you'd expect for the price. The wine list was compelling and the suggestions from the server did pair excellently with my meal. \n\nI absolutely loved my experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak - and it reaffirmed for me that he is the real deal - not the least because he can cook but because he can identify it and manage it in others, because the executive chef Michael Ridder has it going on. Great job to all."

Upon me asking if a vegetarian dish could be made, the waiter seemed a little exasperated and kept on saying that it's not up to him--but the chef.  A little awkward for me, but let's move on.\n\nMy BF, the carnivore, loved the meat here.  He had the beef wellington, sliders, and the fingerling potatoes.  I ordered the fried Asparagus, it was okay.  The Toffee Cake and the Pressed Coffee were delicious.  And lastly, the bottled water was absolutely the best water I've ever tasted in my life.\n\nThe ambiance was dark, sexy, and hip.  I would dress it up if possible, but I saw some couples in jeans and dressed down shirts.\n\nThe service was good--but not great.  Again, our waiter seemed a little annoyed that I asked for a vegetarian dish.  Also, I would have liked him to be a little more personable.  Ask us what we do for a living, where we were from, etc.  I didn't get the chatty vibe from him.  \n\nI booked the reservations a couple of months before we went, and I told them we were celebrating my BF's Birthday.  All the staff remembered when we were seated, and that was cool.\n\nThe price was expensive.  Probably around $100 a person.  \n\nOverall, a great place to celebrate the BF's birthday dinner--not so much if you're a vegetarian."

The Roasted Beef Wellington, was one of the best meals I've ever had.  The filet mignon was buttery tender, and it was seasoned just right.  You could tell from the first bite of food, that the food was the freshest possible, and that quality was a top priority.  The kitchen is open, so that the customers can see their food cooked, and the head chef was very visible.  You could see him tasting all the food to make sure the quality of everything served was up to par, and you could see him lead the cooking and wait staff.\n\nThe food was some of the best I've ever tasted, and it will be a regular dining stop for me whenever I'm in Las Vegas."

(Bold statement but I feel it's warranted!)\n\nWe arrived around 8:20pm and there wasn't a table available for over an hour. As it was just the two of us, we decided to sit by the bar which is full service with no wait time. I would like to add that we tried to book a table earlier in the day but after being given the number to the casino, then the hotel, we gave up and decided to head on over once we were hungry. Anyway suffice to say if you would prefer a table I would definitely recommend booking, it was jam packed all night. (No wonder!!)\n\nSo to start.... The bar tender Oscar is bloody brilliant!!! Friendly, professional and very knowledgable. My husband had a beer and I got a custom made strawberry daiquiri with 1/3 alcohol because I really am a lightweight. \n\nThis was hands down the most delicious, we'll made, perfectly balanced cocktail I have ever had in my life. I'm only 32 years old but my gosh, I have been waiting for a drink to love my whole life and now I have found it! The strawberry and lemon mixed beautifully with the gin and then the hint of basil brings it all together!! Seriously. Worth every penny and I kinda wish we could have an oscar clone in our house to teach us how to make perfect drinks!\n\nAs we are perusing the menu some delightful breads came out... Still warm.. With a lovely butter. I'm British and my husband is American and our taste buds often differ but we were both delighted! The breads were absolutely divine and a lovely selection. \n\nWe shared the pork belly to start - 10/10! I can really appreciate a well cooked pork belly and this was melt in the mouth delicious!  The onion and jam that was served with the pork was perfect. If you had seen us you would have seen the pure joy with every bite. This sounds like an exaggeration doesn't it? It's not. If anything there aren't the words to describe how wonderful it was! \n\nFor the main meal I had the lamb duet and my husband had the beef Wellington, guess how they tasted? That's right yelp land. Bloody perfect! America doesn't offer enough lamb dishes if you ask me... Delighted to see that Gordon is offering a traditional British dish (shepherds pie & lamb chops) and taken them to the next level! \nI'm confident the beef Wellington  was a delicious as my husband reports -- although my lamb was so good I didn't take a bite of his at all! \n\n We ended out perfect meal with a cheese plate and a delightful sticky toffee pudding. Good on Gordon for adding such a staple British pudding to his menu and elevating it to such a high standard! We were audibly satisfied after the first bite - the ooh and ahh that we made during our meals showed the staff how amazed we were. \n\nMy husband rounded off the meal with  johnnie walker blue label neat - and it was the perfect end to the perfect meal. \n\nWhat else? We have covered the food (to clarify: amazing, 10/10, delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned and presented) .... Let's go with the extras. \n\nAmbience: yes. It's dark and it's loud. Noticed that some other yelpers moaned about the music being too loud.... It is loud but I much prefer hearing some inoffensive music to the sound of other diners chatting! \n\nStaff: I would totally recommend sitting at the bar. I already mentioned how lovely and awesome Oscar is. There was also Tracy and Paul. Both as magnificent and polite and professional. What a quality team! They look clean and tidy and we'll presented (off topic but.... Tracy is beautiful with some wonderful eyebrows!!) they were attentive and not overbearing which is a very fine line being at the bar. I appreciated that they kept our water topped up. \n\nRestrooms: so clean and tidy. I also liked that I was shown to them when asked, rather than being pointed through the crowds. \n\nmerchandise: there is a selection of items for sale, displayed very well in the wine rack. I have NEVER in my life bought a tshirt from a restaurant but I will be gladly adorning my Gordon tee, and if they had the red one in men's sizes, my husband would have too. \n\nOverall: I am pretty picky. I am hard to please. I turned to my husband half way through the meal and said - when have I ever loved every single thing about a meal? His reply? Never in your life. THATS right! never before have I been so impressed with a restaurant. We spent $350 and I would happily spend it again tomorrow if we weren't leaving! My husband is going to be away for a year and leaves at the beginning of June. This is our goodbye date in vegas and and this night absolutely made the trip. I am coming back to vegas in  a few weeks to meet with family from the UK and if they don't want to come, I will happily dine at the bar alone. It's that good! \n\nExcellent service\nExcellent food\nValue for money\nAmazing amazing amazing! \n\nMy husband and I are pretty big Gordon fans given that he is bloody brilliant! but now? He's pretty much our favorite ever!"

My rating is based on the Ribeye as I have based all other reviews on this.\n\nWe were slowly walked to our table and told a couple of interesting facts.  Listen to her or you'll miss out on something special.  She seated the wife and placed our napkins on our laps, how cool!!\n\nWe started out with a welcome and an explanation of the ipad list of wines and cocktails.  It seems you can add your selections through the ipad, added them and spent some time looking for the dinner menu.  Note to anyone else, only drinks can be selected.  the dinner menu comes later.  We ordered the Pimm's Cup and The Drifter.  OMG, the best combination of drinks we had on the strip, by far!!!\n\nIn comes the steak display, mirrors and all, with the Kobe placed on top.  At this point, 4 people have been to our table and talked with us in one way or another.  A sign of great things to come.\n\nWe then proceed to order the Maine Lobster (Chorizo filled) as our appetizer, Ribeye with the Loaded Baked Potato and the Beef Wellington with Brussel Sprouts and Bacon.  This is where the eww comes in.  Apon the delivery of the Wellington, my wife found a hair in the glazed root vegetables.  Luckily she found it before we began to eat and the waiter was very apologetic and took it back.  As anyone would do, I sat there waiting for her meal to be redone as my Ribeye sat in front of me.  The waiter then came back and asked if I would like mine kept warm and of course I said yes.  Refire done and meals back on the table in about 5 minutes.\n\nAt this point my wife was so turned off by the hair, that her experience has marked her for life and will not return.  But on the other hand, I truly enjoyed both pieces of meat and only found a couple of bites of gristle in the Ribeye.  Now half way through the meal a manger came up and apologized for the mishap and comped her meal.  What??  Only hers??  I guess that's fair since I did enjoy mine.\n\nOf course we couldn't leave here without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cappuccino which comes with three spoons of Dark, White and Milk Chocolate to mix in.  Both were fabulous and they did put a smile back on the wifes face.\n\nAt this point, I think about 8 people now have been to our table and would explain the higher cost in meals versus the others.  It was very hard for me to choose the rating because the food was great and mistakes do happen, so I will keep to my rating of the Ribeye."

The blue bread dishes had smudges on it.  I ordered by steak medium, it came out rare and over salted.  Then the song Anarchy by the Sex Pistols came on , so I felt guilty eating a $50 piece of meat.  The side dishes came in tin cups, like the ones my toddlers used play with.  The loaded baked potato was unloaded and flavorless. They did not offer fresh black pepper on my caesar salad.

Was a little disappointed to see a few people walking round in shorts and crocs, guess they don't like to turn people away. Although there was no mention of a dress code on open table when I made my reservation.\nI read lots of reviews prior to going and read the menu before I went in so knew before I sat down that I was having the beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding.\nMy appetizer was maine lobster which was divine and my husband had the fois grais which was also divine. I have only had beef wellington once before - which seems strange as Im British, and this was Christmas last year when I made it myself! So I only had that to compare to. Either way it was amazing, melt in your mouth. My husband had the rib cap and he said it was super good. We shared the carrots which were great and the creamed spinach (was ok - very salty).\nDessert came and we decided we wanted to try two things, so we had the sticky toffee pudding and the carrot cake, I don't like carrot cake, but hubby assures me it was great - as for the sticky toffee pudding - WOW!! it was the best I've ever had, and I have had a few in my time. We were so stuffed after and felt like we could have sat in the comfy chairs all night.\nIt was quite loud in there, we were near the kitchen, but we could hold a conversation no problem.\nBefore you order you get to see the meat trolley and all the different steaks, which is pretty cool, but after a while having it pushed by your table (we were next to the kitchen door), it did become a bit annoying.\nOur server was very helpful and polite and we were greeted by each staff member we encountered,\nI would really like to try the tasting menu, so may have to go back for a second visit.\nAlso it's not cheap - so be warned and make sure you make a reservation. There were lots of people being turned away"

We felt let down and had much higher expectations for thus place. I felt that the service and overall experience should have been much better especially given the price we were paying. It was especially disappointing that Ramsey signature dish ( beef  Wellington ) came out cold and the Wellington at a local restaurant where we live is far superior. It was a disappointing experience but I'm giving a 4 star because it did appear the effort was at least there."

I've been managing and laboring in the restaurant business for over three decades, and these people do it right. They really, really do.\n\nOur server, Jonel, is perhaps the very best I've encountered in this industry. My letter of commendation will be in the mail shortly. The staff here is uniformly excellent, but Jonel clearly exceeds that standard. She is genuinely proud of her profession and has obviously mastered it. We were treated on a royal level from start to finish. I cannot recommend her highly enough.\n\nThe food, as expected, was superb. I've yet to find a flaw in any of the dishes here. Two highlights, as suggested by Jonel, were the French Press and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. This is a place where the coffee matters, folks, and the pudding is everything you've read and heard about. Those who remember Butter Brickle ice cream will be taken back to better days--but with vastly improved texture. This dessert--and its presentation--is a true masterpiece. \n\nChef Ramsay believes in value for money. He delivers. He remains at the pinnacle for good reason. When we decide to go out for dinner, these are the folks we should be hiring and the food we should be eating. We've got way too many choices out there, and the majority of them are mediocre at best. \n\nFor my own hard-earned, this is a much better one. I'll be returning, and soon!"

I had high expectations after eating at savoy in London, but they lived up to it. Food was awesome. The steak and seafood was off the hook and the toffee pudding was to die for.  But I have to mention the service.  We had Sean and Anthony taking care of us and it was like 6 star service if I could give it. They knew the menu front and back. They constantly kept an eye on us without feeling overbearing. It was perfect. We definitely would be coming back and for sure we will request Sean and Anthony and for sure some more toffee pudding with extra butter ice cream."

I feel I can call him by his first name from my bill for 2 that I paid for dinner.  I was hoping to see if the winer of Hell's kitchen was in the kitchen but nothing.  Anyways, the food was outstanding.  I started with the Kobe sliders and then the filet.  My wife had the Beef wellington which looked better than it did on TV and was amazing.  That toffee sticky dessert was incredible.  Make sure you save room as you need to get that for dessert.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the music was tooooooooo loud.  I could not hear the waiter or hear my wife from across the table and if you get the sampling platter, you get a signed menu from him.  I tried to buy the menu but they would not sell it to me.  Why do I have to try something I do not want.  Had the wellington which was the only thing on the tasting menu that looked appetizing"

The bread on the wellington was slightly soggy and I was not impressed by the quality and cut of filet. The food arrived warm, the beef wellington was on the verge of room temperature. For the price of this check, I expect my food served hot. Would I come back? Yes. Why? For the sticky toffee pudding."

The lobster was rather tough and chewy, but I'm not usually a lobster fan in all fairness. The waiter was excellent. Unfortunately, it took an hour and a half before our food was served. With a late night reservation for 9:30 pm, that meant we didn't get any food until 11 pm. I was literally falling asleep at the table. There was a private party that appeared to be getting everything coming out of the kitchen first. And the nearby tables that arrived after us all got their food before us. With food quality being just okay and the slow kitchen issues, it wasn't worth the $350 we paid (FYI, we didn't order any appetizers and only one side so bring your pocketbook if you decide to try it)."

Our server quickly introduced himself and the menu. Before we knew it, we came face-to-face with the  mesmerizing steak cart. As good as all the cuts of meat looked on the cart, my friend and I came here for one thing only: THE BEEF WELLINGTON!\n\nI ordered the single serving beef wellington and Mac & Cheese while my buddy ordered the single serving beef wellington and Chorizo stuffed Maine Lobster in brandied lobster cream sauce. Expect 45 minutes for them to make your beef wellington, as it must be cooked perfectly. While we waited, there was so much in the restaurant to look at. The wine bar, the cute hostesses, the gordon ramsay object in the ceiling and the kitchen. The whole presentation of the restaurant was just very welcoming and fancy hipster looking. Service was very good too, I feel unfortunate for the yelp-ers who complained about lack of service.\n\ngrading of our food:\n\nMaine Lobster in cream sauce: A. Friend said it was good, but it wasn't anything you can't find in your local high end steakhouse. \n\nMac & Cheese: B-. The texture and sauce of the dish was dry and didn't quite tantalize my palate. \n\nBeef Wellington: A+. Gordon Ramsay, you got me! Flake was crusty, the beef was \ncooked perfectly and easy to cut. I loved the mash glaze and vegetables it accompanied with. By the time we finished half of the beef wellington, we were so full already.\n\nthe bread: A+. I forget the names of these free bread plates they gave out, but they were phenomenal. I am pretty sure my friend and I went through 3 plates.\n\nBy the time we finished our meal and paid our $180 bill, we were absolutely full. We struggled to walk out of Le Paris, onto the Las Vegas Blvd. My friend and I (both athletes) had to sit down on a bench for a few minutes to rest from that absolute beast of a meal. That's how good GR STEAk IS!\n\nMy only quirk with GR Steak? This is a high end establishment, as least the prices certainly show...where are the white table cloths that usually accompany high end steakhouses?"

The iconic Paris Las Vegas casino that plays host to this steakhouse proudly adorned with a celebrity chef's name that is most famous for his TV show \"Kitchen nightmares\" ....has a nightmare of its' own.  I have eaten here twice and was entirely underwhelmed both times.  Last night (on a Thursday) we had reservations.  It took two hours to get our food....and only after I asked twice ( at 1 hour and again at 1.5 hours).  We had a party of 8 that typically enjoy their cuts medium (rare for me).  Gordon Ramsay steak was clearly chasing their tails on every aspect of our dining experience and it showed.\n\nFINALLY after 2 hours, all cuts showed up blue to rare..  The filet was chewy at best (my cap steak was actually rare and delicious). We saw our waiter 3 times in 2 hours....I know this trick from working in the industry, when things are bad....don't go to the table, just hope the food shows and solves the problem.  Well, it didn't .....I asked for the GM.  He didn't come. Some assistant to some assistant showed up and indicated they were really busy.  Busy? At a restaurant bearing a famous chef's name in an iconic Vegas Casino....isn't that what you do?  I finally walked out on the bill which finally provided me the opportunity to talk to the GM and a gaggle of security.  Apparently your experience at Gordon Ramsay steak does not warrant a talk with the GM until you decide not to pay.  Then he was very clear that he had security there and would not be taking care of the bill.  Seriously...there are a hundred 5 star steak places in Vegas.  I would highly suggest you don't invest your time or money @Gordonramsay steak.  It's a true nightmare.  Try the Strip House @ Planet Hollywood, old Homestead at Caesars, Ruth Christs at Harrahs, BLT steak at Bally's, Or a gaggle of other top notch steak joints in Vegas."

We started with some nice cocktails and appetizers.  The Caesar Salad was a perfect blend of dressing, cheese, and lettuce.  Sometimes places drown their salads to the point were it's more like a little lettuce with the order of dressing.  This was not the case at Steak.  We also had some heirloom tomatoes that were delicious.  I have always seen Beef Wellington on Hells Kitchen and was really looking forward to trying it.  Even with high expectations, I was very impressed.  I totally understand what they mean by flaky pastry and perfectly cooked meat.  The Beef was some of the most tender meat I've ever had.  My wife went with the bone in New York.  I was a little worried because she usually likes her beef cooked more on the well done side.  When she got it I was amazed at how much flavor was retained and how the searing was perfect.  As far as sides go, the Mac and Cheese was just the right amount of \"cheesy\" and the baked potatoes where HUGE!  \n  My only real complaint (and hence the 4 star review) was that the waiting process to get seated seemed confusing.  We walked to the hostess station that was outside of the restaurant in the Casino and checked in.  We were told to go wait in the lounge but there wasn't much room in the lounge because there were quite a few other people waiting in there.  What was confusing was that the hostess who seated people wasn't the same one who checked us in.  So, they kept going around asking \"did you have reservations?.....Oh I sorry we will be ready for you in a few more minutes.\"  Really, if I could figure out how to give a half star this would have been a 4 1/5 star rating.  If you're in Vegas and are a fan of Hells Kitchen it's awesome to go see the place they are competing for...or if you just want a great meal...you can't go wrong here."

I had pre-planned my meal, and every dish that I ordered was a winner. I started with the seared foie gras with herbed goat cheese popovers that was a very generous portion of foie gras perfectly prepared. I had the American rib cap that was even better than what I have had at Per Se! 8 oz. is a perfect size. No additional sauce was needed. I had pommes pur\u00e9e that were lovely. I ended my meal with the stellar sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream that was amazing for flavor and aroma! Service was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely return to Gordon Ramsay Steak!"

The beef wellington for one looked like it was cut in half and the meat was probably the size of a 12oz burger patty.\n\nGo to any quality steakhouse and you'll enjoy the same stuff, just without a celebrity chef endorsement to inflate prices. \n\n\nI'm sure MANY of the 5 star reviews on here were from people who didn't see the check after eating."

            "review": "Gordon Ramsay may be hyped up on tv but his restaurant definitely lives up to it. The restaurant is location in the Paris Hotel right through the casino to the left. There's a huge pillar with his name on it and a cool lighted decorative awning at the entrance. The entire restaurant is beautiful full of simple colors, modern industrial feel and contemporary art. \n\nThe hostess that lead us to our seat gave a brief introduction to the hotel and pointed out a big lighted red centerpiece of the restaurant that represented the motions Gordon makes while making his famous beef Wellington. \n\nThe restaurant offers a cool set \"Hell's Kitchen\" 5-course menu for $145 that includes his famous beef Wellington, sticky toffee pudding and risotto (which is only available on this set meal). Unfortunately, the whole table has to do the HK menu for timing and not everyone was as hungry as me!\n\nThe bread plate that came out was amazing with specialty breads such as lemon, cheese, truffle, bacon. Each had an amazing texture and I couldn't stop eating them! I ended up getting a beef Wellington with Brussel sprouts and truffle Mac n cheese as sides. Every item was done deliciously. The beef was incredibly tender and juicy. It was full of flavor and a quality meat. The portion size was healthy and I couldn't even finish all the delicious steak. All of the sides were also delicious. I don't even like Brussel sprouts and I couldn't get enough of them. The truffle flavor was strong in the Mac n cheese unlike some others I've tried and it was the perfect cheesiness. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding was delicious but a bit sweet. I was really more impressed with the brown butter ice cream that came on the side. It's simply not a flavor that I would've chosen off the bat but it went some perfectly with the toffee pudding! I couldn't eat much of this dessert because it was so rich and I was super stuffed already!\n\nMust come back and try that risotto!"

They discovered that my party (the other 4) had already been seated. I know I was considerably closer to the restaurant than they were and expressed amazement that they beat me, but anway was escorted upstairs to be seated along with the party of 5. I didn't know them... We went back to the podium and ascertained that they had hijacked my reservation, probably by glancing at the computer screen and claiming to be me - they did use my name exactly and knew the time. I was 5 minutes late, that may have been their clue to take advantage, thinking from the monitor that we would be a no-show. Not likely - they require a non-refundable deposit for a table. \"May I watch while Gordon kicks them out?\", I joked, but I did ask them seriously if they would show them door, and they said that they would not, so I didn't get the satisfaction, limiting my retaliation to a dirty look later at their table which I figured would make them know that I knew. So what do you think is the correct way to handle this?\n\nSeated in the balcony area, the entire layout reminded us of Hell's Kitchen. Drinks displayed on an iPad - cool. No children's menu but some choices were offered, daughter went with the mac and cheese.\n\nDress code: Everything was there, I'd say anything goes.\n\nWaitresses: Gorgeous, and cute short dresses.\n\nThe bread basket - fantastic, and waiter generously offered to give more of our favorites. The rolls that look like little cinammon rolls (pancetta and fig within we were told) had a delightful smoky taste and the butter sprinkled with... something... but wonderful.\n\nI ordered the Casear salad. Thank God I did, it was the most fantastic tangy Caesar dressing, served simply on whole Romaine leaves with crouton, fantastic. Wife had the onion soup and it brought her to her knees.\n\nSteaks were perfect (standard filet i.e. not the Kobe). Perfect temperature, perfect char, perfect doneness, perfect tenderness, perfect taste. Better than any steak I had ever had? No - but as good as it gets.\n\nSide: I recommend the mashed potatoes. Everyone liked the mac and cheese a lot, but I didn't care for it as much - don't like blue cheese that much though it was not a strong taste.\n\nWe passed on desert - went to Serendipity 3 instead on the 100+ degree day.\n\nTotal tab came to $440 before tip including several glasses of wine, 4 adults and daughter's mac and cheese. Worth it? $80-$90 a head to dine at a restaurant with perfect ambiance, perfect service, perfect food, and appreciation that the great Gordon Ramsay practices what he preaches? Yes, absolutely, will probably go there whenever we are in Vegas."

Hostess was very helpful and accommodating. \n\nShe then led us to the main dining room and explained the art in the restaurant and seated us at a prime table; a booth that faced the restaurant/lounge and kitchen behind us. She as well let us know who our server was. \n\nLike us, our server was a local. Lumberto was just as kind and thoughtful as I imagined he would be to tourists. From the sommelier to the food runner, they were all very knowledgeable and attentive. \n\nNow to the food - 4.5 out of 5\nThe bread as a starter was so delicious. Lemon & thyme focaccia, bacon roll, herb roll, & blue cheese bread with sea salt butter melted in our mouths. \n\nFoie gras was tasty but I've had better, however, the pairing with the blueberries, macadamia nuts, & goat cheese puffs were pretty good.\n\nThen we ordered the 32 oz. porterhouse for two. We had to compare it to Peter Lugers Steakhouse in Brooklyn. What it came down to is that it wasn't as tasty as Peter's but it was by far the best steak dinner we've had in Vegas. We ordered it mid rare and the crispiness outside and juiciness inside impressed us. It was delish. For sides we ordered the cream spinach and loaded baked potato. The bacon on the loaded baked potato was from a different planet. I would suggest the cream spinach as opposed to the saut\u00e9ed spinach unless you're on a health kick. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the infamous sticky toffee bread pudding, it was gone in about 2 minutes. So delicious, moist, and not too sweet. It was the perfect compliment to a savory dinner. A definite must have!!\n\nOverall, if you're on the fence about what steakhouse to eat in Las Vegas, as an avid steak restaurateur, I recommend Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse first and foremost."

The menu selection has everything a steak lover could want, as well as interesting and enticing appetizers and side dishes. If you do you order a steak be prepared to order at least one, if not two sides, if you are used to large portions. The accompaniments of the entr\u00e9e itself are slim by design and for show. \n\nReservations are HIGHLY recommended. I went on Monday to get them for that night and first available was 4:30 on Wed (or 10:00pm). \n\nUpon arrival we were greeted warmly and asked our family name and addressed as that from there on. We were given a table upstairs overlooking the rest of the restaurant which was a fun view. \n\nOur server was simply fabulous - engaging in conversation and answering our questions about GR, discussing shows, etc. I order a Pimm's Cup, which was delightful and refreshing. \n\nYou can order a la cart or the Taster's menu (straight from Hell's Kitchen at $145/person and everyone at the table must order that to keep the right pacing).  We opted for a la cart because we wanted 8oz beef Wellington v 3oz that was on the taster's menu.  The two of us each ordered a side to split/share. \n\nThe onion soup was delicious, but a bit pricey as an appetizer at $17 dollars. The biggest surprise was the bread plate that was offered to us complementary; I am not much of a bread eater but it was a divine experience with many unique flavor/ texture combinations (lemon thyme cornbread, mushroom tart, blue cheese walnut biscotti). They will bring you more if requested but I caution you as you'll have no room for dessert. \n\nOur main course took a little longer than expected but worth the wait. The Wellington was cooked to perfection. The asparagus was okay but we both agreed we didn't care for the creme fraiche on it. The roasted Brussels sprouts were also good- although I would have liked them roasted even more to bring out that flavor. We could have just had one side to split - it  was enough for us (after having bread and soup). However it may not be enough for some people.\n\nNo room for dessert - sorry!  The only thing that would have made the experience better was if someone chucked our plates down at us and said \"there you go, you donkey!\""

And, it was all that!!\n\nThe interior is fantastic, it's a mix of upscale/contemporary/chic laid out in fantastic oval with a balcony overlooking part of the dining and bar areas.  A large hanging neon art piece suspended from the painted British flag ceiling models Chef Gordon Ramseys hands as he prepares a Wellington, obviously his signature dish, it's great that the restaraunt which has his name infuses also his culture and himself.  Bravo.\n\nI'll shop short at a 5 (I'd actually go 4.5 if I could), I did expect a bit more meaty items on the appetizer list, rather mostly seafood.. which is great to accompany your steak, but what if you already where lined up for seafood?  Or what if you dont like seafood?  We ddi get the oysters on the half shell and they were as expected.  The only other thing was that, although the app for ordering drinks was on an Ipad (how cool is that) it tends to freeze up and is kind of hard to use. \n\nBut, this place should definately be on your Vegas to do list if you like Steak!"

Was hoping for perhaps more refined offerings, though our choices were well prepared and presented with the exception of the oysters. The half dozen shucked did not show great shucking skills with shell pieces in each and one that was unfortunately passed its time. The fried oysters (tempura-like) were well presented though again did not seem to be as fresh as they could have been. We had both The beef and lobster Wellington, great choices for the very hungry. I missed some form of pate in the beef Welly, although every other aspect of it was perfect. Could not make it to dessert.

I was hoping for tender, melt-in-your-mouth bone marrow. Instead I got gelatinous, under-cooked and over seasoned marrow.\n\n+ Corn (side): Awesome\n\n+ Spinach (side): Awesome\n\n+ Ribeye: I ordered mine medium rare and instead got a slab that was mostly rare. I should have sent it back; but didn't want my mom to see I was annoyed.\n\n+ Japanese wagyu; Certainly quite tender, but I have had much better wagyu at other similarly priced steakhouses. However, my mom was reasonably happy with it ... Or so she said.\n\nOverall, this is a tourist trap that is mostly running on brand name. If u want a good steak and are willing to pay for it, there are better options out there."

First things first your gonna need a reservation for sure! 2 weeks before there was still limited availability! Luckily we got in. I live the decor and atmosphere of the place. The bar area was nice and they had an extensive alcohol menu. First problem...the bathroom was flooded, gross. I had to leave the restaurant and walk a bit to get to the restroom.\n\nOnce seated we began the hard decision of choosing our food. We ended up ordering the fish chowder, beef tartar, Waygu rib cap, and beef Wellington. The soup was good, the fish in the soup was really tender and delicious. The tartar was good, but nothing special at all. The 8 oz waygu was really good, super tender and was the reason for the 3 stars! The beef Wellington was good...for beef Wellington! I'm just not a fan of that dish. We also ordered their \"famous\" sticky toffee bread pudding. It was average.\n\nOverall with drinks and tip it was about 350$ and in my opinion not worth it. My steak was delicious but I think with all the other options on the strip I would not be returning. However if your a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and not concerned with price the atmosphere is top notch !"

First, I would like to thank Mike our server, and especially Muhammad for the excellent service!  We were seated in a booth on the second floor- very comfortable.  The only flaw was that music was quite loud- interestingly though, we were able to have a good conversation without yelling.  I had the Kobe beef, which was incredible, and my husband had lamb chops and shepherds pie. He decided he is not really a lamb fan, but the shepherds pie was amazing.  The sides were huge.  Had we realized this, we would only have ordered two.  As it was, we ordered three and took a loaded baked potato with us untouched.  The green beans and creamed spinach were super!  As wonderful as dinner was, the sticky toffee pudding was even better.  Again- big portions.  Everything was bigger and more filling than it appeared.  For the quality and quantity, I was pleasantly surprised with a tab under $200.  A word about dress code... I am not sure if there is one, and my husband and I were in jeans with nice tops.  We felt very comfortable in what we had on, but did notice that most everyone else was dressed up a bit more than that.  So if you are wondering- err on the side of a bit nicer over a bit more casual.   It was a great experience!"

Never have I had a better dish of Mac n Cheese, creamy baked spot on with a little crunch.  I can't wait to go back.  Of course it is expensive but taking into account where and what you are getting it is defiantly worth the splurge."

Service, spot on.  Food very good, not great.  Ambiance, is the downfall.  Very noisy place, with the music and lighting, more like a nightclub.  I guess that's to appeal to the new steampunk millenial hipsters. Usually going out to eat entails conversation, here, though possible, it is difficult, noise and seating is close, lacks privacy that you can expect at restaurants of the same price and caliber.  At first, they tried to sit us at tables facing the kitchen and between the staff, banging plates, and radiant heat, we had to go to the Maitre'd and ask for a better option.  They did take care of it and we only had to wait about 10 minutes over the 15 minutes past our reservation time we were seated. So 7:45 became 8:15, but that wasn't an issue for us. In my honest opinion this place is more about a celeb name and the kind of place to go and see and be seen/at the scene and post your status to social media to impress friends.  I had suggested we go to Flemings on W. Charleston, which is much more what I am used to as a dining experience.  When it's dark, club music playing, weird lighting gave everything a reddish hue, maybe that's a Hell's Kitchen thing??? \nSome of the other diners were trying way too hard to look important and chic.  \nWines we chose were a 2012 Patz and Hall Dutton Ranch Chard, was excellent as expected along with the 2011 Robert Biale Black Chicken Ranch Zinfandel.\nOur server Humberto was really exceptional.\nTotal tab was a little over 500 US dollars for 3 people.  Wine, 2 American/Kobe skirt steaks and 1 NY strip,  2 orders of oysters and a soup, 1 dessert and 1 double expresso.  Plus the vino of course.  Which was $200 for the 2 bottles.\nWas it good, yes, could it have been better, also yes.  \nFor the price, I'd recommend, Flemings, Ruth Chris, Del Frisco's or one of many other great options in town."

You look cute, but dumb as a door nail.  Yippee!  We were there two years ago and I could tell as soon as I cut into the Beef Wellington that it wasn't the same chef.  It was tough.  I had to \"saw\" it to get a bite.  So did my spouse.  We were surprised and questioned the waiter, that's when he told us that the chef was new.  Booooo.  I've had risotto before, but this one was a bit more al dente than I cared for.  The rest of it (the tasting menu) was Devine.  I also didn't care for the 1/2 portions.  The last time for my $$$$$ gave me full servings.  Sure, they give you a full serving of the dessert, but I'd much prefer full portions of the other items. I must warn you, even though we do drink alcohol, the wine pairing, although was perfect, was too much. I was in such a food coma, I'm surprised I made it to the hotel.  I didn't like where we were sat, in the back like we didn't belong.  It was quieter than the rest of the place, but I didn't like it.  I felt like, hey, I'm paying $600 for this spot?  Hummmmm.  Everyone was top-notch.  Corey, Noel and Kevin were very personable. I don't like it when servers tell you that they are going to give you a discount because you're some rewards member, then don't follow through.  Plus not sure if we even got the points. I was too much in a coma to hold his hand through the process and didn't even look at the receipt until we got home.   We won't be going back to this one, only because our next Ramsay visit will be in London!!  Whoo hoo!"

We have watched him make his Beef Wellington so many times on TV we were dying to try it. I got the Lobster Wellington to add some variety. We also had the foie gras app as well as the pork belly. The service was quite slow and we were surprised with the lack of attentiveness. We just wrote it off to being a busy night.\n\nWhen our food came, the apps were delicious. They were pictures of beauty and plated with perfection. The only thing they needed was a little bit of salt which was promptly delivered when I mentioned it to a passing bus boy.\n\nWhen the mains came, we were both shocked with what was presented. It seemed that our food must have been waiting for at least 15 minutes because both our wellingtons were dry and cold. I thought surely the celeriac potato puree would help but upon tasting it, there was not a hint of celeriac to be found. I asked my husband to confirm and he agreed, they must have just used plain potato. I was really disappointed and mentioned the faux pas to our server. She didn't seem to care and shrugged it off. I told her that was one of the main reasons I ordered the lobster over the beef, but she just smirked. I felt cheated. I let my husband finish my meal, he was puzzled as well how we could receive such mediocre food and service at Gordon's house. \n\nWe dropped close to $250 and I left hungry. Worse, I left with my high regard for the Gordon Ramsay brand shattered. I guess he has gotten too big and now things are starting to fall through the cracks. Shame."

It's super ironic that Gordon Ramsey had a show that went to horrible restaurants because I can't recall a worse customer service experience.  There is so much bad at this place it's hard to know where to start, but I think the two things that I disliked the most was the time it took to get anything from our server and the cost of drinking water. It took an hour to get alcoholic drinks and an hour and a half to get a diet soda for me. When my husband reminded the waiter about my diet soda, after waiting so long and being the only one at the table without a beverage, he said someone else was \"working on it\" in a curt tone. \n\nIt possibly took so long to get drinks because they only gave us 2 drink menus for 12 people. \n\nAfter I received my soda, we were finally given food menus. Then, they were sweet enough to leave us alone for about 30 minutes so we could go over the one page of food options. Once we ordered food, it only took another hour for it to get to the table.\n\nThe food was good, but by no means the best I have ever had. I liked the tomato salad, but hated the Mac and cheese, which had way too much truffle oil. \n\nMy husband did not get his food with everyone else because the waiter put the order in wrong. He got food after everyone was finished eating and still paid full price.!.!.!\n\nAnother hour and a half and a major disappearing act from our waiter, we order dessert and request our checks. Imagine the surprise we felt when we found out the water we have been drinking all cost $27 a bottle. At no time did the waiter or any other  staff say anything about the cost of the water or ask us if we wanted another bottle. They just kept filling the cups and we kept drinking because we assumed we were drinking filtered tap water. \n\nIn the end this place was horrible. The waitstaff are the worst, the food is OK- but not the best I have ever had , and the prices are obscene. \n\n2 Side notes: if your going to go and pay a ridiculous amount of money and you decided to get the Beef Wellington just share the \"1 person plate\" because it's the same amount as the two person plate but half the cost!!!!  Also, be aware that for larger parties, a 20% gratuity is automatically added to the bill. It shows on the bill copy, but not on the signature copy- another detail our server must have forgotten to make us aware of."

The flavor was just right for me...not to hard hitting in the front and an easy after taste, and not too fruity. \n\nWe started with the Kurobuta Pork Belly which was delicious. For those of you that don't know, pork belly is very fatty, but the way they cook this,  you don't feel like you're biting into gooey fat. The grits underneath were yummy. \n\nWe each had the American Rib Cap (Wagyu). Best steak of my life, hands down. We also did one steak accompaniment of the Alaskan King Crab Legs which came with 6 legs all ready for you to eat. Those were awesome, but I'm glad we didn't each order that accompaniment as we were stuffed enough already.\n\nFor the sides...truffle Mac and cheese and creamed spinach.

It comes with an ice cream stick that looks like a stick of butter. SOOOO GOOOOOD! \n\nOur total without tip for two people was about $323. So worth every penny!"

Have you ever wished you could see Gordon Ramsays meat...now you can, wheeled out tableside on a cart in all its big and juicy glory..and the waitstaff can tell you all about it. I couldn't help but drool just a little at the site of this carousel filled with wonderful cuts of meat, however I had already made up my mind to order the famous Beef Wellington. Simone had a hard time deciding what to order so she made a meal out of three side dishes. Truffle Mac and Cheese, Grilled Asparagus and Tempura fried Haricot Verts ( Skinny Green Beans).  While waiting for our meal we were treated to an amazing bread assortment (this was actually my favorite part of the meal) The bread included Thyme & Rosemary Foccacia, a sticky bun thing filled with panchetta and another filled with shrooms, and a baguette bread with walnuts. On the side you get some fancy butter speckled with some fancy salt. Everything on the platter was so good I had seconds. Next came the Beef Wellington I was informed this was traditionally cooked medium rare, mine was actually closer to medium well, leading to an unfortunately tough piece of tenderloin baked between puff pastry and kinda bland mushroom pate. This was certainly not as good as I expected. Simone had a bit better luck, her Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy but was a bit overwhelming in the truffle mushroom flavor.  The asparagus was good and included morel mushrooms that were also pretty tasty but this was still an average dish. The green beans were also crunchy and tasty served with a Garlic Aoli, but again I've had better.  Gordon Ramsay is also famous (so I've been told) for his Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding, and this dish was the only one that really wowed me. The bread pudding was more like the best moistest cake you may ever eat and it was especially sweet and rich when drowned in the homemade caramel that is served with it. Also served with it is a deliciously sweet brown butter ice cream, this was so tasty I wish I could have had more.  This was a great ending to an only average meal. I so wanted to love Gordon Ramsey after all the hype but I walked away let down and surprised that the biggest let down off all was the steak. Only 3 stars for Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse."

Not this guy.  Speaking of waitresses, I had Ekaterina and she was terrible.  It wasn't all her fault as we could hardly talk due to noise but I told her I didn't know what many of the menu items were and she didn't offer any help.  She also nearly forgot to offer me deserts and she conveniently forgot to mention TR price discounts.  Fortunately, I remembered from my visit to Burgr that there are slight discounts given.  Speaking of Burgr, the service there provided by server David was OUTSTANDING.  Truly amazing.  So why not the same at Steak?  Maybe it has something to do with receiving a tablet questionnaire at the end of your meal at Burgr.  I was ready to fill one out at Steak but wasn't given the option.\n\nI ordered a NY Strip medium rare.  My first few bites all tasted burnt. I seem to recall in a distant memory from one of Gordon's shows that charred meat can add to the flavor.  To me all it added was a bad burnt taste.  The meat was easy to slice but the flavor was nothing special.  Honestly I prefer the $12 NY Strip meal I used to get at The Lodge gentlemen's club over this.  Not a big fan of a thick NY Strip.  Also, why is there a bone on it?  All that did is prevent me from eating a lot of the meat because it was hard to cut (and see where to cut in the dark corner I was in).\n\nThe loaded baked potato was bleh.  Very dry and needed lots more butter but no servers to be found.  I don't need big ham pieces on my potato when I'm also eating a steak.  The Mac and cheese tasted quite original and interesting.  Although, to be honest it's not like I will ever crave it again.  The bread is quite original and seems expertly made.  Thumbs up to that but to be honest I like complimentary bread at most places.  Thumbs up for it being complimentary here.\n\nEkaterina served me water with no ice.  This ain't Europe.  I want ice in my water!\n\nIt should be noted that I did not have reservations and thus was seated in the lounge area.  Maybe ok for lounging but terrible for eating.  I really should have waited in line at Burgr for 30 minutes instead because the food and service there are so much better."

Whenever I try a new steakhouse for the first time, I judge the place by it's rib eye.\n\nI had a pretty decent 24oz bone in rib eye. It was definitely a prime cut, but the seasoning was very underwhelming. I always refuse to put steak sauces as I am quite the minimalist when it comes to steak, but almost ordered some sauce this time. This was actually a bit shocking, as Gordon himself is quite the critic on his TV shows about other chefs and cooks being shy with seasoning. I also ordered pan seared foie gras which was rather small for the price. Their wines by the glass were quite subpar as well for a steakhouse.\n\nFor those vegas goer's that are looking for a good meal with great music, ambiance, and a dog and pony show (they make up some stupid comment about some shuttle taking you from Paris to London har har), this is your place. For those that are looking for a GREAT steak, consider looking elsewhere, but i don't particularly think you can go wrong if you wanted to just try the brand. \n\nIf you can't get a table here, I'd consider these ranked by my personal opinion top to bottom:\n\nCarnevino (if dining for two as the rib eye for two is probably the best I ever had)\nDelmonico (perfect for those who are minimalists like me who don't mind a little butter)\nCraftsteak (good for ambiance too)\nCut\nPrime\n\nHonorable mention:\nEnvy\nLawry's ( not really Steak but damn good)\nGallagher's"

I ordered it medium rare, which is how I have ordered my steaks my entire life. I actually like them more on the rare side, but I know eating raw meat can't be very good for me. When my Wellington came, I was taken aback. It was completely raw. It was cold on the inside. I asked the waiter if it could be cooked more. He brought me a new one. He said, \"the chef said that is medium rare. If you feel it is too bloody for you, just eat the outside.\"\n\nI wanted to leave. This was the most expensive meal I have ever had. For two of us it came out to over $300. And I literally could not eat my steak. \n\nNow I watch Hell's Kitchen and see Ramsay yell at them for serving Wellington's that are undercooked, and my boyfriend and I laugh because they are waaaay more cooked than the two I received. \n\nI really wanted to enjoy this meal, but it was just disappointing. I am a librarian. We don't make a lot of money, so this is probably to most expensive meal I will ever eat. I just with I could have actually eaten it, and not forked over half of my paycheck to \"eat the outside\" of my meal."

I was so excited to go to this place, as I have only been to one other of his restaurants.  This one did not disappoint.  \nWe ended up waiting about 15 minutes as it was busy, so we checked out the bar.  Rather small, but once you eat at the restaurant you will understand why.  Right away we were given an iPad to scope out the drink menu...I ordered a Guinness to be an ass, and my GF ordered some Pomegranate drink that looked EXACTLY like what was presented on the virtual menu.  This wasnt my first restaurant with an iPad for a menu, but fun nonetheless.  I also noticed the bottle of Louis 13 Remy Martin staring me in the face, but decided to decline as I was going to be drinking heavily all night and did not want to potentially waste it.  The Maitre d' offered to take our drinks to the table when it became ready and we were sat right in front of the kitchen...awesome table!  \nThe actual restaurant was rather dark...but sort of a gastro pub feel...tables were spacious and cleverly designed.  I joked all week about how we were getting the chefs table...well...thats basically what we had with the kitchen being open to the rest of the restaurant.  Unreal table.\nOur server was immediately by our side asking if we needed refreshments.  A few minutes later he explained the different cuts of meats the had available that evening...I believe I counted 10...which came on the cool looking cart by our table side to look at the different cuts.  Fun.  He gave us a few minutes and was no more than 10 feet away at all times.  (I must clarify here...the waiter, at no time during our dining, rushed our courses or made us feel rushed....we even sat at the table enjoying our drinks long after we had finished our meals with no interruptions....again...service was perfect) We ordered wine, and it came in less than a minute...they obviously have a well organized staff.  Minutes later we were ready to order.  I had ordered the veal and kobe beef cavatelli app, a Caesar salad, and the beef wellington.  First the Caesar...amazing....the dressing was an egg dressing, not a mayonnaise based...and it came with deep fried quail eggs...BOMB...a bit salty, but other than that the best Caesar ever.  The veal and beef dish next was hands down the best appetizer I have ever had at any restaurant, save the duck confit I had at his restaurant in Boca Raton.  My brother even ate more of mine than i did.  The Wellington...my first to be honest so I can't really compare...but it was cooked perfectly, the taste was spot on, and the side of truffled mac and cheese i ordered just completed my best dining experience ever.\nOverall, this experience was what I would expect for a group of 4 young adults paying 600 dollars for a meal.  They know it, and I know it....that not only are you paying for top of the line food, but the actual dining experience one would hope for every night out.  \nTop notch...."

Overall, the experience was great but not quite five stars.\n\nWe began by ordering our drinks from an Ipad. This definitely added a fun twist to the experience. However, it also ensures that there will be no misunderstandings of drink orders. Both were $14, a bit much but they went down quite smooth. \n\nWe were seated next to the kitchen. A la Hell's Kitchen, the cooks work within view of their diners. No screams of \"this is RAW\"; instead, we got to see each fancy dish get made!\n\nOur waiter was very attentive - his first question: \"are you a fan of Hell's Kitchen?\" When we affirmed this, he laid down a special prix fixe menu and left for a few minutes. *Hint - avoid the menu unless a signed commemorative menu is worth $135 per person!\n\nInstead we settled on Beef Wellington for Two. The meat was moist and red in the center - leaving a great after-taste. Combined with a gouda and ham baked potato and asparagus topped with morels, we had a delicious dinner. However, prices were not cheap (even by steakhouse standards). Furthermore, our waiter seemed hell-bent on selling us a bottle of wine. He kept emphasizing the cheapest Robert Mondavi (for ONLY $64).\n\nDespite such pushiness to the point of unfriendliness, the bottled water was by far enough. Another waiter explained that the restaurant orders 3/4 of the bottling company's annual production. If you want to try it, you better visit the restaurant!\n\nFinally, make sure to sign up for Total Rewards. The card leads to lower prices on most entrees."

Stripsteak? Old Homestead? They've all taken a backseat.\n\nLonger review:\n\nI made a reservation a month in advance for my wife's birthday as this is probably the hottest restaurant on the strip at the moment.  We had heard so many great things and were already foaming at the mouth as we circled the faux Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe entrance was cool.  Is this what modern London restaurants look like?  I wouldn't know since I'd just eat Indian if I were there.  All the hostesses looked like they were ready to redo Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\" video at a drop of a hat.  Now that everyone under 25 years old has no idea what I am referring to...on to the food!\n\nWe had drinks at the bar while we waited for the table.  I got a gin martini which was accompanied by a very tasty green olive stuffed with bacon and cheese and the wife got the \"English Garden\" cocktail.  That was a terrific drink as well and very refreshing.  The Ipad cocktail menus were neat to zip through and certainly beat flipping pages.  \n\nFinally get seated, order a bottle of red and the wife goes with the \"Sonoma Farms Foie Gras\" with strawberry jam, bacon bits and buttered slices of English muffin.  WOWOWOWOW!  I've eaten some duck liver in my life but never like this.  Whoever came up with this creation deserves an award!  I'd like to have this for breakfast 3 times a week.  How many points is this on Weight Watchers?  \n\nI went with the \"Maine Lobster\" which was stuffed with chorizo, poached in butter with cream and corn.  That was great as well but all I wanted to do was trade it in for more foie gras.  \n\nMy wife always gets filet mignon so I was prepared to get the beef wellington but she threw me a curve and actually went wellington.  I knew that the famed butcher Pat LaFrieda from NYC provided all the beef cuts here.  Great meat for sure but we had been to Old Homestead not too long before and thought it might taste kind of the same.  How freakin wrong I was!!  I was ridiculously taken aback upon my first bite of the ribeye.  This is the same cut of ribeye that Old Homestead gets?  Really??  It was mindblowing how different it was seasoned and prepared.  I was in a beef trance and loved every bite.  My wife really liked the beef wellington and the one bite I had was scrumptious but I was too wrapped up in the monster cut in front of me to focus on anything else :P\n\nWe had the standard creamed spinach and mac & cheese for sides and both were done perfectly.  Service was A+ too.  Too full for dessert.  \n\nOther notes:\n\n- I stopped watching \"Hell's Kitchen\" a few years ago since it seemed like the same season every year but the winner from the most recent season started at the restaurant last week.  She was open to photos and autographs to whoever wanted them.  \n\n- Ordering fish at a place that specializes in steak is like ordering a hamburger in a Chinese restaurant.  I don't get it.\n\n- Don't forget your Caesars Entertainment players card.  You'll save a wee bit on dinner."

Now this isn't a problem, its more of a heads up that you will still be allowed in the restaurant even if you are in casual clothes.\n\nNow on to the review. I believe it is best that you make a reservation because it gets extremely packed here. And this way you're guaranteed a seat. \n\nThe ambiance in the restaurant has sort of a classy/romantic feel which was perfect for my wife and I because it was a special occasion.\n\nOur server was meh (:-/). He would talk to us and explain things on the menu when asked but nothing above and beyond that. Well, while doing all this he  would smile at us but it seemed like he was only doing this because he had too. The guy wasn't mean and he was very patient (As we took a while to decide what we wanted since it was our first time). However, whenever he would smile it looked like it hurt him, it just didn't seem genuine.\n\nAfter a long deliberation we decided to order two salads for our starters (A blue cheese salad and a ceasar salad), the beef wellington for two, and two sides (The sauteed mushrooms and a baked potatoe. Just a word of caution the baked potatoes is hugh you can actually share that between two people.).\n\nThe salads were ok nothing that would blow your mind. But the Beef Wellington was awesome. Let me just say that I was quite hesitant to get the Beef Wellington because they only make medium-rare and I'm the kind of person that likes my beef cooked well-done. But I told my myself what the heck, you've heard so much about the Wellington that I just had to try it and I did and 100% percent satisfied because it was delicious.\n\nAlthough the Wellington is cooked medium-rare they bake it a oven before serving it which eliminates any possibility of seeing any blood (Which I thought I would see but I did not). The Wellington was very tender, moist, and had excellent flavor and texture, I enjoyed every bite. The sides were delicious as well. This was all around one of the better places we ate while in Vegas.\n\nBesides the salad which were just ok everything else was delicious. And because we were so full with the entree we didn't have room for any desert. Hopefully, next time we will be able to order desert.\n\nI strongly feel that Gordon Ramsay Steak is a must visit if you're ever in Vegas."

Some similar restaurants that I can compare it to:  Club 33 at Disneyland.  Watergrill Seafood of Los Angeles, CA.  Texas Land and Cattle of Richardson, TX.  Steakhouse 55 at Disneyland.  Giardina's Restaurant of Greenwood, MS.\n\nBlew EVERYTHING away that I ever had elsewhere, hands down.   My party shared the shellfish platter for an appetizer, superb.  The ceramic kraken platter holder was a true work of art.  Had the Beef Willington as my course.  Definitely lived up to the expectations I had for Ramsay's finest dish.  I had a side of pan seared foie gras to try as it is not available in California.  The fact that it is not available in California should be a culinary crime in itself.  AMAZING dish for anyone with an expanded palate.  My friend ordered the bone morrow to go with his cut of Beef Wellington, which I tried and am now hooked.  My friend's partner ordered the aged filet with saut\u00e9 mushroom that looked and smelled DEVINE.  I did not try the filet as my dish over-whelmed my meat capacity, which is a feat if you ask my friends and family, but I did try his mushrooms and while I do love mushrooms to begin with, the mushroom there made my eyes light up with joy.  My then-girlfriend ordered the salmon, which even at a medium-well (her stomach was feeling uneasy before dinner), came out perfect.  Not dry, yet moist, full of flavor and she even devoured the seared skin, which is rare for her.\n\nThe service was top notch.  Our server Mike, was attentive and polite.  His recommendations were on point.  The manager stopped by our table and even helped choreograph my surprise to my then-girlfriend...that's right ladies, the proposal.  With the company of great friends, a beautiful atmosphere, absolutely perfect food, how could she say anything but \"yes\".  Well...she did say yes after crying for about five minutes.  So folks, 4 years of dating her, the daunting secrecy of requesting support from my parents and grandmother.  The coup with the support of her sister to meet her parents for dinner without my then girlfriend knowing, and arranging for the PERFECT dinner under the guise of her birthday with a lot of help from my good friends, I dropped to a knee and she agreed to marry a hoodlum like me.\n\nGordon Ramsay and the fine service at Steak, thank you for being the icing on the cake so to speak.\n\n#littlechef #meerkat"

Entered a large room sat at a section with five tables with bench seating on one side and chairs on the other. It was close to the bar and my husband was bumped a few times by people standing at the bar. We couldn't have a conversation as the music being played was extremely loud. We were waited on by Alexandru & Mohammed. Waited for bread, waited for water, waited for drinks. Ordered appetizer and salad and waited, ordered a ribeye and short ribs along with spinach and Mac n cheese. The short ribs just fell off the bones and were wonderful (this is the only positive in the whole experience). The ribeye was ordered medium and came as ordered. The knife provided wasn't working to cut it and the server said he would take it back to cook more and bring a new knife. WE declined as  there was no point to that because the rest of the meal was finished and we shared the short ribs. Food was delivered by someone else and neither Alexandru or Mohammed ever came to ask or check to see how the food was or we would have pointed out sooner. The waiter said he would bring dessert as his treat. My husband had been looking forward to the Gordon Ramsay Steak house for quite some time and was extremely disappointed. We visit steakhouses every time we go to Vegas and this was the least enjoyable in terms of atmosphere and food. We don't have an issue in spending for good food but this was not the $$$$ that we paid for it. Oh and to add we indicated to them It was our Anniversary, 31 years, the couple who sat next to us were given champagne and congratulated for their anniversary.  The couple sitting next to us on the other side, their servers we on top of their game and had a nice flow to how they serviced their customers.  Really wouldn't recommend and will not return."

In fact, I ordered the HK tasting menu. Everything on it was so delicious, though I was disappointed by the potion sizes. It only includes half a Wellington (best steak ever!) and the other courses were only a few bites each; I was still hungry heading into the dessert course. However, they give you a full size order of the sticky toffee pudding so you won't leave hungry!"

So we made it a mission to try it out. \n\nWe made reservation 1 month ahead of time to fit in a party of 7. When we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, we were given the option to wait in the lounge area where we can order drinks and wait for our table. Their HK Antioxidant is most refreshing! Tastes like blueberry lemonade! A must try!\n\nOnce seated and ready to order, our waiter brings out a display with all the different types of beef/steak on the menu - except for the fact it was raw. This almost deterred me from getting anything beef or steak alike, but in the end I still went with the Marcho Farms Veal Chop.\n\nWhile the Veal Chop was delicious, I must rave about their dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding. Their Sticky Toffee Pudding is simply - amazing! The combination of the warm and sweet pudding cake doused in brown sugar toffee syrup is quite extraordinary!\n\nOnly negative point was that towards the end of the night our waiter was gone and it seems as if none of the other waiter knew we existed for a while. Eh~"

I ended up arriving about 45 minutes early and they graciously seated me immediately. \n\nThe service staff was amazingly attentive. I explained that I had come for Gordon's Beef  Wellington. Ask them to pick a drink. I was served some thing called the HK. It was a light concoction with cranberry with mint and blueberry accents - perfect. \n\nThen the bread service arrived. A small collection of four different breads and a pat of Devonshire butter. All of the breads were great, but the brioche with prosciutto was special. \n\nThey paired a gorgeous glass of Cabernet from Justin with my Wellington. Both were perfect. The 28 day dry aged filet at the center was amazing. \n\nFor dessert I chose the Sticky Toffee Pudding. This alone was worth the trip! I finished it off with a great cup if French pressed coffee. \n\nPerfection!"

But so WORTH IT!!\n\nMy boyfriend and I started out with drinks: Bloody Mary for me and an espresso martini for him. The Bloody Mary was really yummy, nice and spicy!! The espresso martini was really good as well. It's a little bit on the sweeter side but delicious nonetheless. \n\nAppetizers: besides the house breads they served, we also ordered half a dozen oysters. 4 from the East Coast (forgot the names) and 2 from the West, Kusshi. It came with 3 sauces: ponzu, cocktail sauce, and mignonette. I personally loved the combination of mignonette and cocktail sauce with a little bit of lemon & tabasco. YUMMM!! They were all fresh and buttery.. just how it should be. \n\nEntree: I got the 24oz bone-in ribeye with pan seared foie gras and truffle fingerling potatoes. The boyfriend got the ever so famous Beef Wellington (for 2). OHMYGAHHH!! So good!! I asked for a medium rare and it was perfect. The foie gras paired so well with the ribeye, melted in my mouth.. it was the perfect bite. Truffle fingerling potatoes were amazing as well. It was crispy and soft with just the right amount of truffle oil. My boyfriend really liked the Beef Wellington. He ended up getting what they called the \"MANLY\" Wellington (12oz of fillet compared to the 6oz for one serving) because he was super hungry. He said the flavor was good but the pastry got overwhelming towards the end. Nonetheless, he finished it all, no crumbs.. he loved it!! I wish we made room for dessert but after two rounds of drinks and all of that food, there was no way! We even had left overs too!! \n\nOur dining experience was phenomenal!! The service was top notch, the best I've ever had. I can't wait to dine here again when we come back to Vegas. My boyfriend and I are even planning a suicide trip just to eat here again... it was that good! Gordon Ramsay, you're the man!!!!"

One thing led to another and I found myself watching Kitchen Nightmares (the European edition... then to the American edition). I began to truly enjoy food, whether cooking it (as I learned), or eating it in a whole new light. Kitchen Nightmares led to Hells Kitchen... so on so forth you all get the drift (especially some Chef Ramsay fans).... and now I have two books, have cooked Chef Ramsay's signature dish - 'the Beef Wellington'. And ate at the MAZE in NYC with a couple of friends when I visited the \"city\". That place was on point. Even made me that much more of a fan.... but really to the point..\n\nGordon Ramsay Steak was amazing. From the minute you walked in, the ambiance matched the food and the service... just phenomenal. You might think I'm bias cause I'm a Chef Ramsay fan as stated above but clearly... Gordon Ramsay knows what the heck he's doing. From all his michelin stars... the passion that overflows from the man from what you see from his shows, and the perfection he drives and excels for is shown through the restaurants he's made in his name ... down to the core of what it's all about... the food.\n\nIt was the best steak I've ever had.... I do set the challenge that I can cook a mean asparagus side that I would have rather had because mine were slightly undercooked... but that didn't even cause a scene because of how much the amazing steak, the drinks that accompanied and the service that kept things going. \n\nThe staff are amazing there. Friendly... there exactly when you need them, and at a distance when you'd like them to be at too. Somehow they just knew exactly where to be and how to be. Phenomenal."

His innuendo included that we must have made bad hand gestures at the waiters. Which is pretty hilarious as we were well dressed, uber friendly and considerate. What's funny is the \"compliment\" assumed we were some kind of unworthy hick patrons when in fact we are fine dining addicts. As a person who worked her way through the culinary world as a hostess, waitress, line cook and chef you can't help but laugh that someone is so defensive of the numerous bad reviews that they feel the need to attack the patrons for having a negative opinion. I don't know why anyone not emotionally attached to that place would be so attacking. Watch out Yelpers, the staff may be feeling defensive!"

And very little brown sauce didn't have enough to taste it. Maybe a small handful of veggies. I didn't think anything of it. I thought that's how it was suppose to be served but looking at the pictures on yelp there should of been more of it. \n\nOh shrimp cocktail was exceptional!  M hubby had the Salmon it was ok expected more taste. The truffle potato fingerlings were super yummy!!!! \n\nI would go back and give another try.

Like the uncomfortable red-lit scenes from the 1981 Disney bomb \"The Devil and Max Devlin\" starring Elliott Gould and Bill Cosby. Surprised that Gordon Ramsay approved of the lighting in here. They say that the color red makes you hungry...\n\nCap Of Ribeye ($60) a.k.a. Spinalis steak, is my favorite cut, even more so than Hanger Steak. Both are extremely hard to find, and special orders even at the best independent butcher shops. So maybe it's worth the splurge after all?\n\nThe English Chowder ($18) is pretty terrible. Don't even think of ordering it. Exactly one tiny scallop, one minuscule bit of fish, and 3 halves of a fingerling potato. Boring white chowder with a unnecessarily snazzy presentation - they pour the soup in front of you.\n\nBottom line: Gordon Ramsay Steak will do just fine, regardless of the lighting (or the crappy Chowder)."

The Martinis were fresh and delicious. The complimentary bread basket was delicious especially that fig bread oh my we shamefully kept asking fo more lol. Now onto the main courses. The rib eye was melt in my mouth fatty fabulousness. Sadly I did not like the macaroni and cheese plate. I dunno I prefer creamy hearty mac and cheese over bland with bread crumbs and they mixed some vegetables in it. It tasted \"unique\" by no means was it bad at all but compared to everything else it was just whatev. The decor was awesome. I wish I was rich and could come back here more often. the bill for the two of us was over 200. but we did two drinks each. my friend loved his food too he got some type of seafood sorry dont remember! i tried his french onion soup and it was yummy! i def recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or if youre ballin at the casino or just want a really great memory! Words of the wise MAKE A RESERVATION months before!!!! they were completely booked when we went!!! we managed to sit in the bar area which my friend and i actually agreed the seats looked comfier and it was a bettter view of the overall restaurant but if you have more than two people u will def want a reservation or you will miss out!"

Located in the Paris hotel just off the casino floor, is where my food oasis lies.\n\nAs my wife and I entered the restaurant, there was excitement already circulating throughout my body. Chef Ramsey is by far my favorite chef and I'm a huge fan. His knowledge of food and excitement with food is what really started me yelping restaurants and cooking again. The restaurant is beautiful. It's elegant yet has an energetic vibe to it. The servers are constantly moving. A great sign that the service is going to be good. And it was. Servers are very professional and on point with everything they do. I was watching them work and you just see no one is standing around. Gordon Ramsey has high standards and servers are living up to it.\n\nWe were seated at our table and was given the menu. Everything on the menu just sounded heavenly. It was hard to choose because We wanted everything! But we decided on a soup an appetizer an entree and a dessert. For the soup We went with a English chowder. Smoked haddock with seared scallop. OMG! This soup is fantastic! The chowder was creamy and smooth with a hint of smokey flavor from the Haddock fish. The scallop gave it a sweet flavor and combined together put me in Ecstasy! \n\nOur Appetizer was the Gnocchi. Fantastic! Pillow soft gnocchi with roasted cherry tomato and mushrooms with a creamy mushroom sauce. A fury of flavors all rolled in to one dish. Freshness is what you taste. You can really feel the high standards in the food with just this appetizer.\n\nMy entree was Gordon Ramsey's signature dish. The beef Wellington. When this dish came out my mouth was just drooling! You see this dish on his Hells Kitchen show. On tv it looks amazing but till you see it in person you really appreciate it more. This is an amazing dish. It was extremely tender! This was an explosion of flavor hitting my pallet! The flaky pastry shell, the tender juicy filet, the smooth rich mushroom, it was simply a dish that made whatever problems you had in your life go away for a moment and just made you forget about everything!\n\nMy wife had the mediterranean Sea bass. That is another amazIng dish! The fish was flaky. It came with a cauliflower pur\u00e9e that changed in color when adding lemon juice to it! Wow! It was beautiful and delicious! \n\nFor dessert We went with another signature dish. The sticky toffee pudding. OMG!!! Amazing!!!! The warm bread pudding topped with a warm sauce with a brown butter ice cream was heaven on a plate! It was delicious! It's a dish words don't do it justice! You have to try it yourself to truly appreciate it. \n\nWe had an amazing dinner. The time we spent at Gordon Ramsey steak, is a moment in time we will never forget. It made us forget about some bad news we just received and put a big smile on both our faces. Great food can make great moments and that's what we had. I just wish I was able to meet Gordon Ramsey, that would have been icing on the cake!"

And there's a huge center piece on the ceiling - a neon \"art\" sculpture of Chef Ramsay's hand cut movements. \n\nMy bf and I were excited to try the food, since Chef Ramsay only commands the BEST, so he ordered a filet mignon and I, the beef wellington, the signature dish. \n\nSo I ordered the beef wellington without knowing what it was. I heard that it was the signature dish and went for it. I didn't take to the pastry crust with pate and duxelles (I think that was chopped mushrooms), but the meat. OH, THAT WAS THE BOMB. In fact, both of our meats were easy to cut and had a good amount of pink. And THAT MEAT; it melted when we chewed in.

When we asked the girl seating us she became distraught and ran off leaving us in the dining room. Then we were handed our drinks while standing there. We eventually got our booth but things started off on the wrong foot.\n\nWe ordered the pork belly to start. Overall the meat was tender and sauce was Spicy. I probably would not order again based on the price. It was good but just that. We also had the beef Wellington for dinner. I had this before at the Maze in NYC. It was juicy and well seasoned. The dough was slightly on the overcooked side. We then ate the Mac and cheese. This was delicious with a slight edge of sweetness.\n\nThe drinks were also very good. I recommend the antioxidant. This drink was light and refreshing.  \n\nOur waiter and other staff were attentive. Although I found it strange, it was so over staffed that at least five staff at a time were standing in a circle talking. The atmosphere was okay. Very loud and busy.

            "review": "I just want to say that I wasn't a fan of Gordon Ramsay's food.  I'd been to the London in LA and also BurGR in Vegas and wasn't impressed with either.  As a result, I had pretty low expectations for Steak.  My friend really wanted to try it, though, and we were able to secure reservations at a decent time.  The place was very loud, but we were seated in a plush booth upstairs, which served to buffer out some of the loud music.  Beforehand, though, we had to wait a bit for our table, and decided to grab a drink at the bar.  Unfortunately, all bar seating was full and there really is no area to wait around with a drink.  It took a while for us to order and get our drinks bc the bartenders were super busy, but my drink was good.  After we got our drinks, we were seated upstairs.  On the way up, the hostess informed us that we were now leaving Paris, entering the Chunnel and were now in London - pretty cool.\n\nThe waiter immediately placed an iPad down with the drink menu on it.  We had already ordered our drinks, so we just perused the menu again while waiting for the food menu.  We waited quite a long time for our menus - possibly because there is only one Wheel of Meat that is brought to your table at the same time.  Anyway, I wish they just gave us the menu when we were seated instead of having to wait like 15 minutes.  The wheel of meat was pretty cool, as it showed a lot of the different cuts of meat.  We ended up ordering:\n\n-Beef Wellington (1 Serving - $56) - We weren't sure if one serving equated to half a piece of meat/pastry or two (cut in half) - luckily it was the latter.  The puff pastry does fall off the meat but it was light and flaky - not soggy.  I personally don't think I am a big fan of this dish and would rather have the steak alone, but it was different (in a good way).  Steak was also very tender.\n-American Rib Cap w/ Foie Gras ($60 + $18 for foie gras) - We thought the foie gras would come on the side but it came on top of the steak.  It looked (and tasted) like it was cooked w/ the steak.  It was freaking delicious.  The steak itself was a type of wagyu cut I'm guessing (as it was under the Wagyu category on the menu) and expensive for only 8 ounces.  However, the meat was flavorful and tender...really good.  With the delicious foie gras, it was over the top.  I will prob not order foie gras again for the next few years bc I always feel guilty about it, but I'm glad I got it here.  \n-Side of Corn - Corn was sweet and came with bits of caramelized onions on top, which I liked.  However, I still prefer Lawry's Creamed Corn.  This was not creamed corn, by the way.\n-Sticky Toffee Pudding - I loved the stick of \"butter\" (ice cream shaped like a butter stick) that came with it.  I am not sure what flavor it was (caramel?) but was was really good.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding was also good but it didn't amaze me.  Maybe if it came warmer?  It was lukewarm upon arrival at our table.\n\nThe second drink my friend got looked really small in the glass!  It was probably equivalent to a shot and a little bit of other liquid, but she really enjoyed the taste.  Their specialty drinks are $14 each on their menu.  My second drink had cucumber in it and was quite refreshing and strong.  \n\nOverall the experience was a good one, though service might be improved, which many people do comment on.  The food is a tad bit overpriced, though I guess that's what star power commands these days, I guess.  It's a fun place to go if you're in the mood for some expensive meat!  I was stuffed at the end of our meal."

The only reason for the lack of a fifth star is for the loud music inside and the sardine can we felt like we were sitting in. Could barely hear each other from across the table because of the loud music. Tables are so close to one another when the wait staff steps in between the tables you get an A$$ in your face. Not cool when I'm trying to eat. Asked for another table and were told we would have to wait 20 minutes when there was an open table 5 feet away."

            "review": "Went specifically because it was a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant and wanted to try the Beef Wellington. Made reservations ahead of time and when we arrived the hostess was prompt with seating us and giving us a brief history on the restaurant and the decorations. The wait staff was professional and well dressed for the atmosphere. The decorations are unique and eye catching but not distasteful. One of the immediate problems that I had was they sat us at a table for two which isnt the problem but it is how close you sit to other customers. There is barely any room for the waiter and it seemed they insisted at squeezing between the tables when coming for service. The meal was fantastic and the Beef Wellington was just tender and full of flavor. Service was great the entire time we were there; cleanliness of the table and silverware was spotless and wait times between meals was not too long. If your a meat eater then there meat prize cart might interest you as it has all of their cuts presented in fashion."

Our server informed us that the Wellington we ordered would take about 45 mins to cook. It was probably closer to an hour during the dinner rush, but well worth the wait. Our wine was a fantastic pairing and the complimentary breads were fantastic as well. We had to catch a show so we were in a bit of a rush and didn't have time to truly enjoy the full dining experience, but it was still a wonderful time and a phenomenal meal!"

            "review": "Steak is vibrant fine-dining.  If you're looking for a stuffy, hoity-toity dining experience, go somewhere else.  It's a nice meal, so plan 2-3 hours to enjoy it.  if you want to grab a bite, they have a bar area that serves a few of the appetizers, a big version of the american kobe sliders, and fish and chips.\n\nThe overwhelming feeling you get from dining there is that there is a team (dare I say army) of staff looking after your dining experience.  Each table gets a waiter, a backup waiter, a sommelier, and a countless number of staff that fill in the gaps (filling water, etc).  Ladies would be escorted to the restroom if anyone saw them stand up and while they were gone, someone (the sommelier a lot of times) would stop to fold up her napkin and chat until she returned (pulling the chair out for her).  Just Bravo to everyone there... I've never felt more cared for in a service establishment.  Oh, and when the food arrives, each diner's plate is served by a single waiter and served in unison (the visual effect is amazing).\n\nBefore getting to the food, I have to tip my hat to the kitchen.  For all of the great front-of-house staff, they really went above and beyond.  Having a fascination with scotch eggs at the time, I wanted to try one of the scotch quail eggs that comes on the caesar salad and was willing to pay for the salad just to get the egg.  Nope, compliments of the chef for the entire table.  Every item on that menu was prepared beyond reproach and special requests handled perfectly.\n\nGet a soup, starter, dinner, and dessert (and I'd recommend that order too).  The British ale onion soup is the best if going for meat as your main (just sets everything up nicely), and the asparagus soup is perfect if going for seafood (very seafood-y taste... in a GREAT way).  My favorite appetizer was the foi gras, followed by the pork belly (the pork rinds served as garnish were silly good too).\n\nThe american kobe rib cap is the richest cut of steak I've had.  The key thing is that they really don't do anything to the steak... that's left up to you.  I guess the idea is to let the cut speak for itself (which it does) and you can use the peppercorn on the plate to change up the flavor a bit or get a sauce on the side (not a bad idea to have for about half-way through the steak).\n\nSides... mac & chese, always.  You only need 1 order for 4 people because it's SO RICH!  All others were great, this one just stood out the most.\n\nDessert, find one you don't like, I dare you.  The chocolate layers is a dark-chocolate dream, the sticky toffee pudding is insane, but I'd go so far as to say that the best dessert on the menu (the one that sticks with me the most) was the peach trio.  It's just a refreshing end to whatever meal your having.\n\nOh, final note... get still water rather than tap.  Yes, it's silly to pay for water, but the flavors are so strong that tap water tastes REALLY bitter between courses."

Despite the great displays I was dead set on ordering Gordon's signature dish, the Roasted Beef Wellington. As sides, we ordered the Mac & Cheese and Roasted Heirloom Carrots.\n\nThe Beef Wellington was great. It melts in your mouth and the pastry complimented the filet very nicely. While it was great, I would never order it again because of how amazingly delicious the few bites of the Rib Cap I was able to steal from my significant other. Wow. The cut was perfect. Full-flavored and succulent. I'm not sure a steak could be prepared any better.\n\nThe sides: The Roasted Heirloom Carrots were the best carrots I have ever had. Don't be scared of the hot wing sauce. They are not overly spicy. The combination of the sweetness of the carrot with the sauce and being roasted was a delightful treat. Now, comes the Mac & Cheese. I was skeptical that mac & cheese was on the menu of a fine establishment, but it made me think there must be a reason for it. So, I took the plunge and I was not disappointed. The other reviews don't do it justice. One cheese doesn't overpower the other. It was the perfect storm of cheesy goodness. A cheese tornado if you will. I don't know how I will eat mac & cheese again and not reminisce about this dish.\n\nThe service was great. We weren't constantly harassed and the staff knew what we wanted even before we asked for it.\n\nThe visit was great. Having recently taken a trip to Paris, France, Paris Hotel & Casino brought back memories of walking along the Seine and sitting in front of the Eiffel Tower in all its glory.\n\nThere are tons of fantastic places to eat in Las Vegas, but if you have an opportunity to visit Gordon Ramsay Steak I would recommend doing so."

The service was great and passed all of my checks for a fine dining experience: asking the ladies first about their orders, quick to refill our water, polite and friendly with all of our questions... I was expecting a lot from their service and they did not disappoint.  \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was pretty good, but didn't meet my high expectations.  We were given some bread to start.  There were a few different kinds and they were all delicious, although one of them was rather oily.  From the menu, we got the seared foie gras appetizer.  It was seared well and the flavors were all great.  I could've done with less of the goat cheese, but that definitely didn't make me love the dish any less.  After the appetizer, my girlfriend got the filet mignon with a side of asparagus and foie gras complement and I got the rib eye with a side of the truffle mac and cheese and bone marrow complement.  Her asparagus was what I'd expected (nothing special imo) and I was so full from everything that I got, that I didn't even taste her foie.  The bone marrow that I got , as other yelpers had mentioned already, is rather bland, so I wouldn't get it again, but that truffle mac and cheese... yes!  So rich and delicious. As far as the steak goes, it was good, but I docked a point because it didn't meet the expectations that I had for it.  I felt it was a little on the rarer side (I got medium rare) and it could've used a more seasoning.  The sear was good, but I've definitely had far better steaks at other restaurants.  \n\nOverall, I do like this place.  The steaks were overpriced for what I got, but the foie gras appetizer and the truffle mac and cheese were really great."

I have been in Las Vegas many times, but this is the first time I have indulged at Gordon Ramsey Steak. Well I am so glad I did so this weekend. I came to vegas last minute by myself so I was a little hesitant to book at any sit down restaurants, I decide to suck it up and book. I had a show to go to that night so I booked the early 4:30 time slot and let the staff know I was on a time line to make it to my show.  They sat me right away and the wait staff was over to my table instantly to make sure I was looked after. Speaking of the wait staff, my waiter Lomberto was beyond great! I was so impressed at his knowledge of the menu, also in how he engaged me to make sure I was informed of all of my options. Offering numerous opinions of the food without being pushy about it. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu, and man was it ever great. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try a few different things off the menu. Plus you get scallop Rissotto which is not on the regular menu.  The cocktail/ wine list on an iPad was a very nice touch as well. Also a nice touch is how they bring a cart with all the cuts of meat directly to your table side and explain them all to you. Very cool. Also when you order the tasting menu, you receive a copy of the menu with a signed photo of Gordon Ramsey on the other side of a Hell's Kitchen cardboard picture frame booklet.\n\nI enjoyed my visit so much that on my way out I decided to book for the next night as well, seeing that I had a show again at the Paris that night. The host staff again was great at getting me a reservation early. As I was leaving the General Manager of the restaurant Jean Philippe thanked me for visiting. I told him how I really enjoyed myself. I also mention that I would be back the next day and was hoping to see Lomberto again. Upon arriving the next day JP greeted me with a smile and a handshake, thanking me for visiting again. When he noticed I was not seated in Lomberto's section he quickly made a correction, even after I insisted that it was no trouble either way. I was again sat very quickly and Lomberto met me with a big smile and handshake as well. We discussed some items on the regular menu and again any questions I may have had we're answered expertly! What made the second night start of perfectly is that I was sent out an Amuse Bouche from the chef thanking me for visiting again. That Chef was  Jon from season 11 of Hell's Kitchen. He finished 3rd but in my opinion should have won. Obviously Mr. Ramsey liked him enough as he is working at Ramsey Steak. I was sitting in one of the tables beside the open kitchen, again I was sitting by myself as the night before and he came over and asked how I was enjoying my dinner. When I responded that everything was done perfectly, he shook my hand and thanked me and told me to enjoy the rest of my meal. I finished up and Lomberto pretty much walked me out of the restaurant and gave me his card and said anytime I was in town to come see him. Also on my way out I was met again by JP and he also gave me his card and said to contact him if I ever needed anything as far as future visits were concerned. \n\nNow I realize that a Lot of restaurants offer great service and so they should. I just felt that all of these individuals went out of their way to make sure I enjoyed myself. In my book when service is that good they deserve my business and that is why I will be returning there for a dinner whenever in vegas."

My rib cap was very good and my husband said it was better and he would prefer that over the Wellington. I did have to send mine back as I had asked for medium well and it was medium rare at most. We had full view of the kitchen and the cook acted irritated that it was sent back. That was disappointing as it was very clear to our server as well. We also had the beet salad...so good and the pork belly...yum! We had asparagus, which was likely the best asparagus that I had ever eaten at a restaurant. The sauce is delicious! We also had the macaroni and cheese, which was just ok. \nA tip....if you want \"free\" water then ask for tap. We were offered sparkling or still and chose still (our mistake for not asking for tap) and were charged $9/glass. Kind of steep considering our well poured drinks (Crown and water and Grey Goose and soda) were $13 each.\nService was amazing at the beginning but we felt that our main server, Charles, was really pushing on selling the menu. When we didn't \"buy\" all that he wanted us to it seemed as if our service started lacking. In fact, we were there for an anniversary, which they knew, and acknowledged. The table next to us was there for an anniversary as well and the server brought them a dessert at the end with a candle and acknowledged the anniversary again....we received nothing. Not a huge deal but would have been a nice touch, especially with the table next to us receiving such from a different server."

It tasted not too salty, not too sweet, just right, with hints of tastes of bacon.\n Their seafood was especially amazing as well. They put an array of sauces such as garlic. They even put lemons on the side for you to get and flavor it. They put the delicious lobster and crab, and their mussels and oysters were clean and like a palette for you to add your own flavors with the sauces and the lemon.\n Our busboy, Noel, espicially made contact with us and we ended up socializing. Along with the other waiter Charles, they were extremely polite and wasn't rude at all. \n I especially love their kid-friendly environment. It was lively and very active! The child wanted a strawberry martini, they allowed it but they took out all the alcohol so he can drink it.\n Now onto the bad part: It took a while to get the food, but it was all worth it in the end because it tasted juicy, salted, and sweet."

For the appetizer we had the lobster and crab , both delicious.  The asparagus soup is a definite must try.  Maiden course we had the Kobe filet - out of this world.  Sides were the Mac n cheese and asparagus, amazing as well.  Be sure to ask for the ABC spoons with your coffee. They are little shots of amaretto, baileys, and chambord inside of milk, dark, and white chocolate.  The panacotta for dessert was the perfect ending.  We will definitely eat here on every visit to Vegas.  Loved it."

            "review": "Gordon Ramsay Steak is great.  I'd give it 4  1/2 stars (I don't know why I don't give it 5), but Yelp doesn't seem to allow  1/2 stars.  The food is excellent, and the service was flawless.  If you can, try to get Alex (or Alec) as your waiter.  He is a Cary Grant of waiters.  They don't come any better than that. If you are fortunate enough to get him, you'll know what I mean.  \n\nAnyway, starting from the beginning, I don't usually drink--why waste money and calories on alcohol--but I decided to live a little and got The Drifter.  It was delicious--sweet, but not too sweet--a drink to be savored.  I didn't want to drink the last drop.  One drink was enough--they do not skimp on the alcohol.  One drink gives a nice glow.  \n\nAfter ordering dinner, I noticed an empty bread and butter plate on the table and wondered where the bread and rolls were.  I love good bread and rolls slathered with butter (which often means I'm not hungry when the real food comes).  At Gordon Ramsay Steak they bring out one little plate for the table, with little rolls (they look like cinnamon rolls but they aren't), small slices of focaccia, and a small portion of wonderful butter--sweet butter, with salt added to it.  You have to share the bread plate, and it looks like there's not enough, but there is.   It's enough to tide you over until the real food comes.  (By the way, we took a long time looking at the menu and there was no hurry to order something--we were treated like guests--and there were no long wait-times for anything.)    \n\nFor dinner, I started with the octopus and potato salad.  I'd never had octopus before, and I found out that it's tender and very mild, and nothing to write home about.  The potato salad was the best I've ever had.  It's mildly tart--subtle--with a little crunch.  The fingerling potatoes were perfectly cooked.  It doesn't need a couple slices of octopus to make it special.  But, potato salad is too heavy for a first course.  Seems to me it would be better suited as a side dish.   \nFor the main course, I had Beef Wellington, with creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides.  When I ordered, Alex murmured (so only I could hear) \"that's a lot of food,\" and he was right.  I'd assumed the portions would be small, but they aren't.  Each of the side dishes (as well as the first course) could be shared by two people.  But, I was happy to have leftovers to take home. \n\nThe creamed spinach was yummy--it can't be made out of just spinach and cream.  I'd get it again, and I don't know if I'd share it. \n\nMac and cheese is one of my favorite dishes, and I've seen rave reviews about Gordon Ramsay's mac and cheese, but his mac and cheese is not the good old American mac and cheese I grew up with.  It's not gluey or what I would call \"comfort food.\"  It's light--the macaroni was perfectly cooked--and has a mild woodsy flavor.  While I was sitting at the table, I smelled occasional whiffs of wood smoke, which brought back memories of the smell of the wood cabins we stayed in when I went camping with the Girl Scouts 60 years ago.  Turns out, it was the mac and cheese being served at other tables.  My niece told me that one of the ingredients of Gordon Ramsay's mac and cheese is truffle oil.  Well, even though it wasn't what I expected, I've decided I like Gordon Ramsay's mac and cheese.  I had some as leftovers, and it I grew on me.  I suppose it's the truffle oil that grew on me. Truffle oil!\n\nI've saved the best for last.  The Beef Wellington is wonderful. It was perfectly cooked.  I can't imagine why anyone would order a steak, even the steaks at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The beef tenderloin in perfectly cooked Beef Wellington almost melts in your mouth.  Gordon Ramsay gets the well-deserved credit for the restaurant--his name is on it, it is his standards and probably his recipes for a lot of the dishes--but the chefs deserve the credit for how well the food is actually prepared, day after day, dish after dish.    \n\nI do not have anything negative to say about Gordon Ramsay Steak--even the paper towels in the restrooms are exceptional--very thick paper, almost like cloth.  Everyone there was nice.  Some reviews say it's loud, but I didn't notice that.  We were in the balcony and maybe that makes a difference.  As to the price, when my nephew's company had a conference at the MGM Grand, his wife and eight-year- old son had a very modest breakfast there and were charged $60 dollars!   I'd say Gordon Ramsay Steak is very good value for the money. \n\nI've eaten in great restaurants in Chicago, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Denver, Cincinnati, etc., and I can say, without any qualification, that Gordon Ramsay Steak is a great restaurant.   I've got to say, as good as it is, if I went back and Alex were not my waiter, I'd be a little disappointed.  I give Alex five stars, and I highly recommend Gordon Ramsay Steak, with or without Alex."

The restaurant has a very cool entrance (a replica of the chunnel) and it has a very cool vibe and decor.  We had an amazing meal - we started off with the Kobe beef sliders which were super tasty.  Then I had the beef short ribs which were AMAZING - soooooooooo good.  My husband had the American Kobe Beef filet which was the best cut of meat the restaurant had and he LOVED it.  He also ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side and it was heavenly.  The best Mac and Cheese I have ever had.  \n\nBy the way, for drinks the strawberry martini was unreal.  It wasn't overpowered with strawberry flavor it was just right and sooooo delicious!  We then had desert which of course was just unreal.  We ordered the sticky toffee pudding desert and the chocolate layer cake.  The toffee pudding was one of the most delicious deserts I have ever had - it was so moist and it just melted in your mouth.  The chocolate cake was also super good but it was a pretty small serving on it.  Just 3 bites worth but it was an amazing three bites!  \n\nOverall an excellent meal and we can't wait to go back!

I was terribly disappointed by the taste but I think what made it worse was that it seemed like for some reason that both of our plates seemed to be under temperature. I ordered the beef Wellington and my wife ordered the prime beef fillet. While my wife's tasted great, it did seem to under temperature. My beef Wellington tasted ok but after sending it back once for the temperature, it came back the same way. The next morning I became SICK and I can only think that it was due to this...all in all i can't say I would recommend this place but the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING was amazing!!Also DO NOT order the risotto!! We paid \"market price\" which was 65.00!!!!!!! Not worth it due to the fact that it was the size of a coffee cup and it had 2 scallops that tasted ok but felt like I was eating sand due to the crunching in my mouth! Pretty sure that's not normal!

I try to 'man it up a bit' and get something more substantial, which twice has meant it has gone back and once I ate the lot. The cuts can be extremely tough, a lot of gristle and interconnecting tissue. Staff either offered to get something else (why do they do that when clearly the other guest has finished, and yes I would complain earlier but they do not pester the table to often) or remove it from the bill. Again quite professional, but personally I would just like to eat it. \n\nFor an enjoyable night and to be able to clear the plate, get the fillet. I know I will next time."

Favorite steak of the night. That being said, having been to both the Hollywood and Vegas Ramsay restaurants, I prefer the Los Angeles preparation.\n\nThe Los Angeles kitchen pretty much is prepared the same except it comes with a container of sauce that tasted a bit like jam. It moisturize the meat and gave the steak a little bit more kick. Like cranberry sauce on slicea of turkey.\n\nPorterhouse (5/5)\nI believe the steak was somehow thinly breaded and was pan seared with some sort of red wine and beef broth reduction. Then sprinkled with salt.\n\nWasn't my favorite cut of the night, possibly my least favorite one, but amongst porterhouses, best implementation so far. The flavorful outsides really carry through the rest of the steak.\n\nAmerican Rib Cap (5/5)\nSecond favorite steak and I'm thinking I might prefer this over filet mignon and possibly prime rib. Not too sure.\n\nThe steak was extremely juicy, moist, and flavorful. If the Wellington didn't dominate so hard on so many factors this would definitely reign supreme.\n\nMac and Cheese (5/5)\nMac and cheese with truffle oil. Pretty much describes it to a tee. I love truffle oil. So an easy five from me. I bet this dish can be taken up a level with a dash of jalapeno. \n\nSauteed Mushrooms (5/5)\nA medley of sliced sautewd mushrooms. The mushrooms tasted like mushrooms. Really not much more can be done with them, nor should there be.\n\nMaine Lobster (5/5)\nChorizo stuffed lobster... I've never had my lobsters stuffed with anything before. It was definitely interesting. Not sure if the stuffing altered the flavor of the lobster in any way,  but the lobster was very flavorful and moist. The sauce that accompanied it was wonderful, a very light sauce that didn't overpower the lobsters natural flavors. The chorizo was present as well, along with some corn. I'm left wondering if the chorizo had any effect on this dish or what its role truly was...\n\nService (6/5)\nThere's great service, and then there's Donnie's level of service. From his presentation of steak cuts, to hos recommendations, to how he handled our billing mishap. He near perfect experience with something on the bill that might've soured our experience to a blemish free experience.\n\nWe were not happy with the fact that we were billed for the water option which we thought were free. So he took it off our bill and the rest of my party stopped frowning and I'm sure the move will result in many positive yelp reviews. Thank you for taking care of us Donnie.\n\nGordon, I fucking hope I'd be able to shake your hand and grab a pic with you one of these days ;)"

Dirty glasses remain on the table, the wine flight 'pairing' often comes 10 minutes or more before the course it is to accompany. \n\nThe Hells Kitchen tasting menu is a let down.

We had 9:15 reservations but arrived early hoping to be seated before then.  Unfortunately we were not, but we had a great experience at the bar while we did wait.  The bartender was friendly and answered all of our questions, he asked us what our preferences were and made drink suggestions.  I unfortunately can't remember the name of the drinks, but they were delicious! \n\nWe were seated at 9:15 and greeted by our very polite waiter and waitress.  They brought out a display of all of the different cuts of meat and explained each one to us, which I loved.  Now on to the food:\n\nBread Plate: A great spread of different breads, there is one with fig in it that's amazing.  As much as you'll want to keep eating- DONT!  Save room for the good stuff.\n\nAppetizer: Market Green Salad & Pulled Pork Tortellini.  The salad was good, the tortellini was just OK..it was a bit hard.  \n\nMain: Myself and my cousin both ordered the American Kobe Rib Cap, which was recommended by both the bartender and the waiter.  My cousins husband ordered the beef wellington and my boyfriend ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye.  We were super excited when our meals came out.  Unfortunately my cousin and I are both very salt sensitive and found our rib caps to be over seasoned and WAY too salty.  The cut of meat was very good though.  If you're sensitive to salt...definitely mention that to them before ordering.  The beef wellington was delicious, as was the rib-eye.  Both cooked and seasoned to perfection.  \n\nSides: Sauteed spinach, potato puree,  mac & cheese.  The mac and cheese and potato puree were both amazing.  I wish I had more room to finish them...I would have licked the plate.  The sauteed spinach is nothing special...we just wanted to add something green to the mix.  \n\nSince it was my boyfriends birthday, the waiter suggested a pudding with butter ice cream which didn't look very appetizing but was phenomenal.  A friendly waiter came over and sang happy birthday...beautifully!  \n\nOver all we had a great night, the super salty Rib Cap didn't ruin it for me enough to give it any less than 4 stars, I just know to order another cut of meat next time.  The bill came to about $500 with the tip for 4 people.  Not surprising for a nice steak house, and worth it."

And being my very first beef wellington ever, I'm happy to report that Gordon Ramsay's version doesn't disappoint.  It's beautifully medium-rare and seasoned to perfection.  Accompany it with a side of their mac n cheese and you're done for the day.\n\nAll the apps we tried were top notch as well:\nFois gras - so fatty, so good and so banned in California lol.\nBeef tartare with raw quail egg - super beefy and rich.\nRaw oysters - fresh and sweet with notes of the sea.\n\nI'll be back to try the bone-in new york strip.\n\nThis place gets packed quickly so make your reservations early."

It was the consensus of our party that it seemed to block noise ... and it also allowed for a nice overview of the vibrant, beautiful establishment.\n\nAdditionally, set aside about ninety-minutes for this experience (if you invest in multiple courses). And, let me assure you, it is well worth your time. (Seriously, relish this time away from the cheesy chaos of Vegas). \n\nNow, our server was the absolute best. (I wish I could remember his name!) He was charming, warm, knowledgeable, and attentive. (The \"meat lecture,\" complete with rolling visual-aids, was fascinating ... trust me, you will enjoy it!) While everyone in my party ordered these lovely pieces of meat, I am a vegetarian (and did not want to spoil anyone's night out). When I told the server, he did not blink (or scoff), instead, he immediately accommodated me (he set me up with a beautiful beet salad and a variety of sides that were the equivalent of a hearty meal). This amazing man also assisted us in selecting the perfect beer to accompany our entrees (the Fin du Monde was simply spot-on). This culinary genius also selected the perfect sauce for each entree ... without hesitation or pretense. \n\nEach person raved about his/her experience. One person literally said it was the first time in months that someone genuinely got \"medium rare\" right. And, while no one was a bit hungry, we still had to try the sticky toffee pudding. Now, if you have had the push-up pops at BurGr and thought you experienced the \"real deal,\" you have not. The push-up pops are fun (we enjoyed those), but this was AMAZING! The interplay of hot and cold is essential to the enjoyment of this dessert ... try it, you will agree.\n\nIn essence, the food was delicious. But, in complete honesty, it was this server that made our experience \"five-stars.\" He was not pretentious (as we suspected may happen here and were entire wrong about), he was not \"pushy,\" he was not dismissive ... he was a professional, super nice, sweetheart who literally made our night! (And, we are still talking about him two weeks later!)\n\nKnow that this is an experience, not just \"a meal.\" Instead of throwing money into a slot machine, why not spend it here, bonding with family and friends. \n\nChef Ramsay has certainly created a bastion of sanity in an otherwise crazy place! Thank you so much for that! We will never forget our visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak."

Anything with Gordon's name on it should be amazing right?\n\nWe had a reservation. When we got there we were told they were running a few minutes behind. Not a big deal and we waited in the lounge.  Then I noticed people were being seated before us who came way after us. My boyfriend checked with the hostess and sure enough he said it looked like we were \"skipped\" and that they are going to be seating us now. I don't know if we have bad luck or what because this has happened to us before. Its very aggravating. How hard is it to seat people in the proper order?\n\nOnce we arrived to our table I was immediately disappointed. We were seated in a long section of tables lined up side by side (half booth with chair) and only inches away from the table next to us on either side. Guess there wouldn't be much private chatter for us.\n\nThe food was good but again I was not blown away at all. For the prices you expect something spectacular. I told my boyfriend to get the asparagus soup because everyone here in the reviews seemed to think it was delicious. He did not care for it and thought it was salty and fishy. I felt bad because I am the one who told him to try it. I got the onion soup, and it was good but very strong in onion flavor. Nothing that knocked my socks off.\n\nHe ordered the wellington and I ordered the filet. He did seem to enjoy the wellington so that was a plus. My filet was blah. I ordered a peppercorn sauce on the side but this is not necessary as it does come with some kind of sauce on it. I wish I'd known that, because they do charge you extra for sauce and it was not that good. Also, we have made better filets ourselves at home. We also ordered mac and cheese and asparagus. Again, both just okay. After reading the reviews I thought the macaroni and cheese would be out of this world? Am I just having way too high of expectations? It was just less flavorful than I was expecting. Just kind of boring and not full of flavor that I was hoping for, as well as the asparagus was nothing special either. Average.\n\nWe had the sticky toffee pudding dessert which was very good but they only give you very little ice cream with it. If it had more ice cream with it would have been more enjoyable. \n\nThe plus was the waiter. He was very polite and apologetic if anything was lagging and thanked us for our patience more than once. Checked on us thoroughly. My drinks were awesome. The strawberry martini is delicious and the HK antioxidant was also. However it was annoying to see the HK drink comes in a little glass that was mostly filled with ice and not even filled to the top. So, you really don't get very much of it. The drinks were $14, so should have at least felt like I was having a full glass.\n\nDon't get me wrong. We enjoyed this place overall. I was just expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. After tip and all our meal was $300. Just hard to justify since it wasn't amazing. The ambiance isn't very romantic either. I feel like we could have had better food and more privacy and romance in another restaurant. But, I am glad we got to check it out and I know what its all about. Don't keep your expectation too high going here and maybe you will not be as disappointed as I was."

It lacked salt and pepper but did have some kind of worchester-like sauce on top. \n\nThe service got progressively worse as the night went on. Water went unfilled and our main server stopped being attentive. Our reservation was for 7:30 PM. We didn't leave the restaurant until 10:30 PM because of all the waiting! \n\nGRS continues to suffer from excessively loud music and it gets hard to talk to your table over the music.\n\nWe finally spoke up and the manager took action and got our bill done with an apology.

My girlfriend had the HK Antioxidant cocktail which she seemed to enjoy. I ordered the Green Flash Cedar Plank Pale Ale. My response from the server, \"oh, is that a beer?\" You have 10 taps... I know beer probably isn't the hot commodity here, but with only 10 taps, you should probably know them. She then proceeded to bring me out the Green Flash West Coast IPA by the bottle. I let her know of the mistake and she fixed it. Not a big deal. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the sea bass entree on the menu, and I ordered the bone in ribeye. The server then asked how my girlfriend would like her fish prepared, which I figured meant grilled, saut\u00e9ed, blackened, something along these lines. The server said \"no, like medium, medium well, etc.?\" Ummm medium rare I guess? Ordered my steak medium rare as well as their Mac and cheese and asparagus. As I expected, she came back to let me know the fish was only prepared one way. Not a big deal. \n\n40 minutes go by...\n\nEntrees arrive finally and by this time we're starving and really excited to dig in. Her first bite, \"this is really boring.\" I tried her dish, one of the driest pieces of fish I've ever had. Extremely overcooked. Cut into my steak, borderline medium well. I'm usually more understanding with this stuff but after waiting 40 minutes and having the expectations I did, I had to say something about it. The server took the dishes back and proceeded to cut open the steak through the middle and bring it back to me to show me that's how their medium rare looks with the ribeye. Oh, so you should probably tell your customers to order it blue if they want a properly cooked medium rare steak. Cut through the middle, it was still medium well. \n\nI asked to pay for my drinks and we left. Unfortunately, we didn't have another 40 minutes to wait for our meals. At this point I realized the Mac and cheese never made it to the table either.\n\nI don't blame the server. She was sweet and very understanding. She definitely was not knowledgable on the menu, but her kindness made it easy to overlook that. First visit to a Ramsay restaurant and it probably will be the last."

The Wellington was mine; I have always loved it and never see it on any menu.  We chose to dine here because of the Beef Wellington.  The roasted root vegetables were outstanding and left me wanting more.  We ordered mac and cheese for the table and it was okay, not the best.  The cheese was too mild and lacked flavor or seasoning.  We also had carrots and it felt like someone forgot that they had added the cayenne pepper twice.  It was way over-spiced and almost inedible.  But the bread was amazing and the other steaks were perfectly done.  Unusual.  And the best was last -- there is no better dessert than the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream.  Never have I had such a fine ice cream.  Perfect in its rich smoothness.  Our service was excellent.  Richard and Derrick were attentive and personable.  We really felt like VIP guests.  Kudos on outstanding team from the\" Master Chef\" was there and we were told no by the Hell's Kitchen winner we were hoping to see -- Christina!  I just wanted to shake her hand, but I am sure the term Master Chef(a different competition) threw her off and she thought we were looking for Gordon Ramsay.  At the time, I thought she was just blowing us off.. Still an awesome experience."

I started out with a vodka martini with these amazing \"hamburger olives\" which was a green olive cut in half and restuffed with Blue Cheese and Bacon....OMG!!!! I must have embarrassed myself with smiles because the waitress brought over an extra one saying that I had \"too much fun with the first one.\"  I told her when it came time to order dinner that I would just go with the kitchen recommendation or the dish they were best known for, so that turned out to be the Beef Wellington.  It was truly the best think I've ever had!  The filet was perfection and the pastry was perfect!  While we waited for the entry, a plate of bread samples arrived which were amazing...I've been searching like crazy for the recipes ever since.

We went to the bar for $14 martinis which were excellent. At 8:40, we asked if they remembered us. At 8:50 we were seated. On the short stroll from the bar to the restaurant, customers go through a tunnel where the bored hostess says something stupid about being transported from Paris (Paris Casino) to London in under one minute. We were then asked to stop and look up at the ceiling at a very ugly neon piece of art which apparently was inspired by the hand movements of Gordon Ramsay. It might also be any three year old's scribbles on a paper. The hostess was not inspired. We were then seated, in a very tight quarters on the main floor where we were offered an autographed menu and special food choices should we only both agree to the $145 per head set menu on the autographed menu.\n\nWe then ordered pea soup and onion soup. At 9:15, a full 90 minutes into Hell's Night Out, we were served two cold bowls of soup. I had complained loudly to server, server's assistant and manager. The manager promised to \"oversee\" our meal. The soup was terrible. Simply stated, we had better quality soup from room service at the Trump hotel the night before. We did not finish our soup.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Argentinian wine. It was a $30 retail bottle they sold us for $125. I am ok with restraurants tripling the value of a bottle of wine but assuming Gordon Ramsay paid $20 for this, the markup was 600%. Note that the wine list is shared with customers on an Ipad which is a crappy way to pick wine.\n\nOur steaks came out at 9:15. They were excellent. The tempura green beans were not as good as the exact same tempura green beans at any PF Changs. The potato puree was colder than the soup.\n\nTo our left, the couple celebrating a 30th birthday, also had cold potatoes. To our right, a couple from the UK, had to send back their cold mashed potatoes.\n\nAll three of us were offered free sticky pudding. Our soup was comped.\n\nQuite frankly, this restaurant doens't live up to the hype, doesn't justify the prices and quite frankly would not make it through an hour of the celebrity chef's show. I\"ve been to Vegas 15 times, this was the single worst dining experience of all trips combined. Our limo driver laughed when we said we were going to Ramsey Steak.... we should have taken the warning and never entered this grossly overpriced and incredibly corney experience.\n\nNote this was on a Thursday night. Clearly the kitchen isn't ready for weekend crowds."

The ambiance was really relaxing. The lights were dimmed throughout the restaurant which gave it a mellow and romantic setting, depending on who you are with. \n\nI had a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday and since I arrived about 20 minutes early, the hostess sat us at the bar to browse the drink meau while our table was being made for us. The restaurant was packed but luckily our reservation guaranteed us a seat on time! Our waiter was super nice and not to mention..good looking! What a treat! Before we ordered, the waiter showed us the meat that the restaurant used to make the dishes, this was really nice since we get to see which portion of what meat is used for our meals. We ordered the appetizer sliders, beef Wellingtons, Lobster Wellington, and a side of truffle Mac & cheese. Our Wellingtons took 45 minutes but luckily were had some of their delicious bread which came in 3 different flavors ( I wish I remember what they were ).\n\nI really liked the sliders, that's definitely a must try. I got my beef Wellington in medium rare which is what it is recommended in. Personally for me, I liked the wellington, however, I was not in love with the dish like many of my other friends who have raved about it so much. Perhaps it was hyped up for me among my group of friends or Hells Kitchen but the beef Wellington to me was simply a 7/10. I would definitely get it again in the future but first I would try some other dishes first. I had a chance to taste some of the Lobster Wellington and I was not a fan of that entree. The lobster was a bit too salty and it tasted like a regular lobster meatball to me. If I had to choose, I would for sure choose the beef Wellington over the Lobster. As for the truffle Mac & cheese, it was a disappointment. Once again, a little too salty and you can't really taste the truffle in it. If you haven't had a chance to try Alexander steakhouse then all I gotta say is, try it! Their truffle Mac & cheese is to die for at Alexander's steakhouse compared to Ramsey's. In the end, I ordered the toffee pudding dessert and I absolutely LOVED IT. The ice cream paired perfectly with the caramel and toffee cake. It was the perfect cherry on top to my dinner. \n\nI give this restaurant a 4/5 stars because my expectations was not exceeded. However, I still liked the service, the environment, & some of the dishes. Next time I come back I would probably try the Hells Kitchen experience for the experience or try some of the other dishes I wanted to try."

The ribeye was slightly better due to the fattiness but in general they both tasted similar.  Definitely dry aged and prime but still didn't capture the same fattiness and flavor as a kobe or wagyu.  The prices were also a bit high so be prepared to spend for the name of the restaurant.\n\nhowever, the decor of the place was very neat.  Definitely reminded me of hells kitchen with its red and black theme so points up for that."

Never had anything like them.  If I didn't have a job, and lived in Vegas, I'd want to work there just to take the leftovers home!\n\nThe foie gras was highly disappointing.  I LOVE beef and chicken liver and this just didn't taste much like liver at all.  The texture is way different as well. Maybe that's why so many people like it.  Had to try it.\n\nThe bone marrow...just super bland.  But hey, like the foie gras, had to try it at least once.\n\nI had the American Wagyu Rib Cap.  A delicious cut of meat with just the right kind and amount of sauce.  Also cooked to perfection.  This is the perfect compromise between the rib eye and the filet.  Big thanks goes to the waiter for that recommendation! \n\nThe wife had the star dish of the night!  The Beef Short Rib with potato pur\u00e9e, and wild mushrooms.  This dish will make you close your eyes and groan!  It was so tender and had that kind of fat in it that just melts like butter in your mouth!  The flavor reminded me of pot roast my Grandma used to make while she was alive.  \n\nExtremely pricey meal,  but worth it.  Had I known, I would have dropped the bone marrow, the foie gras, and the two $9 bottles of water and that would have cut the bill by $58.  Live and learn.  We will be back when in town!"

We were told by the waiter that he can't do a togo order and that the chef refused to make it. We spoke to the manager and was told by mike coney (general manager) that he isn't going to let us do a Togo Order because it would change the integrity of their food. Which we understand if that was a standard in their policy. The only problem is we had been in three weeks prior and placed a Togo order and there wasn't a problem.

We ordered Sidecars for our drinks and they were stong and delightful.  The selection of breads was impressive and so tasty!  My husband ordered the Kobe Beef Tartar and I got the Kobe Beef Sliders as an Appetizer.  Hubby's app was served with a flair for the dramatic and came with amazing housemade potato crisps.  My Sliders were to die for!  The 45 minute wait for The Beef Wellington was well worth it.. and since we were seated near the pass, we had plenty to watch.  My husband got the Fisherman's Selection.  He said the mussels tasted a bit funny and the lobster was rubbery.. BUT the fish was amazing and and scallops were perfectly done.. so.. all in all it was a decent entree.  I got the Wellington with a side of Mac and Cheese.  I shared both with hubby because it was too much for just me.  We unfortunately didn't have room for dessert.\n\nOnly downsides.. the presentation by the hostess was comically pretentious (the neon sculpture in the center of the room is a representation of Gordon Ramsay's hand movements in the kitchen)  and the noise level of the music was extreme... but otherwise it was a great dining experience and well worth the high price.

I am from the NYC -Philly area so I know good food.. and maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought the food was super mediocre. The bread was off the hook, but my chicken was relatively bland. I also got the kobe beef sliders and they were delicious. My husband got a $50 steak and they gave him the crappiest knife ever. Seriously, you could have the perfect steak, but with a crappy knife you can't really enjoy it. Sounds weird until you go to some locations that allow you to choose the knife.\n\nAs a business owner I was super attentive to the staff and cleanliness. The restaurant was spotless. So clean. The staff... well lets split that up. The front desk staff consisted of 5 girls and they were pretty worthless as far as help goes. We had a reservation made two weeks in advance and we were sat about 25 minutes late which is a shame, but can be forgiven. The girls just seemed to stand there with no clue about much and a snobby attitude. \n\nOnce we got seated I was impressed with the structure that was created for all of the waiters and waitresses to follow. I couldn't believe how they were so well trained and maintained their professionalism [even when we told our waiter he could relax because we aren't stuffy at all and were just there to relax]. So I would love to talk to Gordon about his curriculum for that!\n\nOther negative - It was extremely cold and extremely loud in there.\n\nSo, 3 stars I think is a fair rating for this high end restaurant!"

We staged it all slow to come out gradually with the help of our expert server Genti. He was fabulous, fun and very helpful. We requested to meet the chef on duty that night and met Jonathan a contender on one of the cooking shows during the fourth season (think mo-hawk) invited by Gordon to come to Las Vegas and cook in his restaurant. Then back up to our table for sticky toffee and brown butter ice cream and the Apple dessert (again we couldn't choose just 1!) yum!!!! \n\nMy advice to those 1-2 star folks, order meals the restaurant specializes in and those you can't make yourself... Why order a salad you can get anywhere when your dropping big money on the main event. And folks... The puff pastry is supposed to come off the Beef Wellington when you eat it, it's not glued on...\n\nOnly one request of the restaurant, PLEASE ENFORCE A DRESS CODE, we arrived dressed for an expensive, romantic evening out only to see the couple at a table in front of us; he was wearing shabby, dirty plaid shorts, a hole filled t-shirt, unlaced tennis shoes, unshaven face and long stringy hair...

            "review": "Simply outstanding.  Best steak I have ever eaten in my life!! Since I am a die hard Gordon Ramsay fan, I had to visit his steak house.  I had read mixed reviews but needed to see for myself.  The restaurant itself is in the Paris hotel, and is pretty chic.  Little things like high quality paper towels in the ladies room with the name of the restaurant imprinted make for a cooler experience.  Our server was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the menu and gave us a lecture on the menu that was accompanied by a very cool display of meats.  I learned a lot about meats and was able to see the ruby red colors due to the mirrors that showcased that top side of each cut for the whole table to see.  Interactive cocktail menu on the ipad was very cool as well.  The meal began with a nice selection of breads.  The one that stands out is the fig pinwheel...very yummy.  The Caesar salad was accompanied by a scottish egg.  The salad was crisp, the croutons were crunchy (not too crunchy so they cut your mouth), cheese was thinly sliced and the dressing was super fresh. Best Caesar salad ever.  Now, for the star.  The Beef wellington.  How can you not order this if you have seen his show!! It was AMAZING.  Fireworks amazing.  It just melted in my mouth. The temperature was perfect...it was just outrageously, sinfully perfect.  The potatoes and root vegetables on the dish were beautiful and tasty.  We ordered the truffle mac and cheese which was excellent, the asparagus which were pretty standard and the Brussel sprouts which screamed EAT ME! Don't STOP! They were seasoned eloquently and meaty in their texture and consistency.  Just a big fat YUM! Now, on to the most spectacular dessert! Sticky toffee pudding was to die for.  It was sexy on every level: plating, taste and sh-arability. The ice cream looks like a stick of butter and you can cut a piece for each piece of cake you eat.  All around this was a memorable experience in every way, and it helped I was with 5 of my dearest girlfriends and we shared everything (My friend that ordered the rib cap shared a bite and it was fantastic).  Kudos to Gordon for being able to dish out what he dishes out!!"

            "review": "Edited - upgraded to a 3 star - it is better than the compared 2 star ratings for other places that I have reviewed - but still was disappointed in the experience, we had higher expectations for a restaurant of this caliber.  Plus, I was contacted by management expressing their concerns of my review and I was impressed with their desire to improve.  I wish more establishments took that initiative.\n\nI have to admit, we were underwhelmed with our dining experience.  This is due to the fact that it's a celebrity restaurant and high dollar menu and the only item on the menu that we would rave about it the sticky toffee pudding.  That was absolutely fabulous!  We had reservations about 2 months in advance and we were sat back in the corner with not much of a view of the rest of the establishment, except to watch the wait staff gab at their station or people enter and exit and elevator.\n\nWe are fans of the show Master Chef and my husband was dying to try his famous beef wellington.  The menu says it takes 45 minutes, but I think they had a few in the works as it didn't seem as fresh as maybe it should have and didn't feel like it took that long (but we didn't time it)?  Neither of us has had one before, so nothing to compare it to.  It was good, but it wasn't amazing, which we expected.  I ordered one of their fish options and it was fishy tasting.  I guess some fish can be that way?  I wasn't super pleased with it, it was edible.  We also ordered an appetizer, the chorizo stuffed lobster as we figured we wanted something to taste while waiting for the 45 minute main entree.  It was probably as big as an index finger?  The flavor was ok, not really sure where the chorizo was.  We also split a very nice bottle of wine which a sommelier helped us select.\n\nOur server seemed a bit stuffy, literally felt he was scoffing on the inside.  Wish we had the server that was helping the table next to us as he was full of personality and I overheard some good menu suggestions and then wished he was there to help me make my selection (we had already ordered).\n\nWe do not frequent a lot of high end restaurants - probably 2 or 3 a year to treat ourselves.  Unfortunately, I would have to suggest you not to waste your money here (in Gordon's frequently used disappointing statement \"damn\").  It simply wasn't worth it."

            "review": "I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and although the hype is still high for this place, I have to say that I didn't come out of here impressed.  For the price point and caliber that this place strives for, it was just simply \"good enough.\"  First the food:  To start, there was the seared foie gras was quite good; nearly as memorable as what we had in Paris, France a couple of years back (still our benchmark).  I had a Prime Beef Filet (8oz) and ordered it medium.  While the steak came out fine, it lacked some flavor and one part of it was a bit too charred for my taste.  My girlfriend had the infamous Beef Wellington and that was prepared and presented very well.  The beef itself was very tender and just melted in your mouth.  But again, the flavor seemed a bit off.  The red wine demi glace was a bit too powerful for the dish and overwhelmed to the point where it was ignored.  For a side dish, we went with the Mac and Cheese and while it was ok, the truffle oil completely overpowered any other flavors.  Dessert was pretty good though. Rather than go for the butter toffee pudding, we opted for the Blueberry Tarts paired with a Moscato.\n\nHere's where the experience fell apart for us:\nReservations were at 9:15pm; we arrived at 9:00pm and were seated promptly despite being 15min early.  Our hostess was fairly robotic in her presentation, something I would not have expected at a place like this.  Our server however while knowledgable enough for the menu as scripted, it felt exactly like that:  a script.  When presented the various cuts of meat, there were no further info other than the script itself that describes each cut but little else.  When asked for advice or preferences on a wine pairing, our server was of no help and simply referred us to the Hell's Kitchen Tasting menu for reference.  The pairing suggested in that menu with the Beef Wellington was completely wrong in my opinion since it overpowered the dish to such a degree that it was better off consumed before and after the meal rather than during.  I will however give kudos for the prompt service and attention to detail.  At the very least, when you needed something or a course had to be cleared, it was done right when you expected it.    \n\nThis place also lacks any real ambiance short of the decoration of the facility itself.  It neither presents itself as upscale, fine dining, or anything of the like if that is what you're expecting, and yet the requested attire is \"business casual.\"  The decor and overall feeling wouldn't feel out of place in an english pub and while that's fine for the other establishments bearing Gordon Ramsay's name, it just did not feel right for this place as it is advertised.\n\nOverall, I'd suggest this as a \"one-time\" visit.  But don't hold your expectations too high."

            "review": "My friend took me here for dinner. Everyone who wrote a great review for this place is a wannbe foodie. Foodies' taste and discernment cannot be obtained overnight. It is lifetime of eating fine food. I would take a wild guess here that most of the reviewers for Gordon Ramsey don't know what good food is.\nThis placed confirmed for me that British food sucks. My friend and I had drinks at the bar, I ordered the Pimm's Cup which was awful. From the pic you'd think it would be fruity and tasty but it was far from that.\nWhen the hostess came to sit us. She said, \"We are now leaving Paris and entering London.\" What the hell! The last I looked we are still in the USA. The \"art\" that she was pointing to was awful. One of the neon bulbs was out so much for art with the British flag as the background.\nI ordered veal chops, you'd think that they could have made a decent veal - but I had to remind myself that British folks can't cook. I ordered it medium rare and I had a tough time cutting it with their steak knife. The waiter's excuse was that the veal should have been cooked longer. What the \"F\"? Cook longer? I like my veal medium rare. Everything was so salty. It was similar to pouring a jar of salt in your mouth.  It didn't matter which dish was ordered. Even their haricot verts was salty. How can you f that up? The foie gras was horrible as well - you guessed it - it was so salty.\nThe next night I took my friend to Le Cirque quite the opposite of Gordon Ramsey's. The food was superb as always. The service was impeccable. When in doubt go for French food. I have to remind myself that french folks can cook some incredible meals."

Being a big fan of all of Gordon Ramsay's TV shows I thought it would be an amazing idea to take them and their wives to Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris Hotel. Based on the standard of excellence I see on his TV shows, I expected much more. At first, the service was good. Food was explained. Each cut of steak was displayed and we all decided on our meals. I ordered French Onion soup as my appetizer and i ordered Pork Belly as my meal. Two of us ordered the Waygu Rib Cap and the other two ordered Fillet. We shared the following sides: Baked Potato, Brussel Sprouts, Beet Salad, Foie Gras. \n\nThe consensus was that the best thing we ate was the Loaded Baked Potato. The other sides were good as well. Steaks were OK, but overcooked.\n\nAfter we ordered we didn't get any service. Our waiter ignored us from that point forward. We were never asked how our food was. If so, we could have told them the meat was overcooked.\n\nOnce we were done we sat with empty plates in front of us for at least 15 minutes. I know it's fine dining and it isn't supposes to be \"Fast,\" but we had bussers and waiters walk by us many times without even asking if we wanted our table cleared. We weren't wanting to leave, but we didn't want empty plates in front of us either.\n\nI don't think I would go back. I would simply head over to the Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian where the service has been exceptional."

No way you can get a reservation on a Saturday night but we came in and sat at the bar area which has a lot of room, and a lot of tables. Our high table had a better position or view than some of the tables near the kitchen, so unless you can make a reservation upstairs I would say you can get a great table at the bar almost any time. The waitress was impeccable, she had all the answers and the way she managed everything was outstanding. They get great training I believe, because when I wanted to try some cider beer (the drinks menu is on an iPad by the way) she explained why it looks so much like cider and not so much like beer. She also said they tried all the drinks in training and this one gave her the most buzz. We got the Gnocchi, Wellington steak and a file, all super great. We didn't like the Fois Gras, too fat for my taste, but at $25 a plate I'm pretty sure most people love it! The spinach and mushroom sides were delicious and so is the starting bread they serve, it's actually different pastries. We just couldn't try any dessert since we were absolutely full after 2 days in Vegas, but the ones we saw at the other tables looked fantastic. The whole d\u00e9cor and light is carefully thought out and also the sound, there is loud music in the background but not intrusive when you talk at the table, you can hear everyone just fine and there is no need for yelling. It's the perfect place to have a great time and an awesome experience together with great food."

We sat down at a little after 8pm (8:15ish) and we did not receive our food until a little after 10pm. The manager came by and apologized saying that the kitchen was behind...but almost 2 hours! The worst part is this was on Halloween so we did not get done eating until close to 11pm after scarfing our food down. It was such a let down since it was my friends birthday. They did give us a birthday dessert but honestly after waiting 2 hours to receiving our food we were ready to go vs. waiting another 20 minutes. I ordered the chicken...DO NOT DO IT! Not very flavorful but those who ordered the steak were pleased. Mac and Cheese and the dessert was far better than my meal itself. For the price tag I would go to a nice buffet any day-"

Cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared the decomposed cheesecake with blueberry compote.  This was not your Cheesecake Factory cheesecake.

We're avid fans of Gordon Ramsay's tv shows so Steak was definitely on our must-eat list for this trip to Vegas! We didn't get there until nearly 10pm so we assumed our best bet was sitting at the bar and ordering from their bar menu. We walked in and there was also a cute \"dining\" area in the bar area which was mostly full (the dining room wasn't full at all at this time of night). We sat down in the bar area and much to our surprise we were able to order from the full menu! Our server was really helpful, gave us great recommendations on steak (he got the American Kobe Rib Cap and I got the American Kobe Filet, both excellent!). We ordered the gnocchi and the pork belly to start, the gnocchi had really great flavor and the pork belly melted in your mouth. With our steaks, we split the Mac and cheese. It was perfectly cooked but had blue cheese in it. We may not have ordered it if we had full read the ingredients, but it was still very tasty. Lots of cheese and not too saucy. We looked at the dessert menu, but after such an amazing meal we were too full! But the couple next to us ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it looked delicious, just like something I've had in England! \nOne nice touch that we both appreciated, was that the wait staff gave a full explanation of your food as they served it to you. Everyone was very friendly and answered all our questions about Gordon Ramsay. Haha :) \nMy parents dry age their own steak, so I know how nice and tender a steak can be and both of our steaks really exceeded my expectations. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good steak and a nice dining atmosphere."

I got the beef wellington and thought it was amazing and raved about it to everyone. Everything was perfect - the beef melted in my mouth and the pastry was deliciously flaky. Fast forward just a year and a bit later, and I made sure a stop here was on our itinerary. I debated ordering something different for my main this time, but couldn't resist the allure of the beef wellington... was it as good as I remembered it? Unfortunately I have to say I was just a tad bit disappointed, because I didn't enjoy it quite as much the second time around. I still liked the texture of the beef, which was very soft, but my overall impression of the dish was just... salty, and I don't know if it was from the beef or the pastry, but it took away from the experience. I tried a bit of the ribeye steak (which comes in a HUGE monster portion), and didn't think there was anything special about it to be honest... just an average steak, albeit juicy, but I thought the outside was a bit too charred for my liking.\n\nWe got a couple of apps to share, which sounded promising but in the end weren't really my cup of tea unfortunately. The gnocchi with iberico jamon and mushrooms was pretty good, but I thought the jamon was much too dry. I was surprised by the foie gras, which didn't come in a pate form, but was rather just... really fatty meat, which I wasn't crazy about. My friend ordered a side of spinach to accompany his steak, and surprisingly that was quite good. The price of $100+ per person was quite high as expected, although we also did order a bottle of wine. I would still consider coming a third time, but would definitely order something else, maybe their wagyu or something."

Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff. The service was what I expected, very alert, my water glass never went half way empty. I ordered the ricotta ravioli, she ordered the pea soup. For entrees I ordered the beef wellington and she had the kobe skirt steak. For sides we selected the grilled mushrooms and a stuffed potato. I was disappointed that the risotto was not available to order on its own. The only way to try it was ordering the hells kitchen pre-fix menu, and at $145 per person I did not want to try it that bad. With the exception of the pea soup, all the food was very good as expected. The peas soup was more like a puree of peas with a very earthy taste and the carrot jello-like thing in the middle was much too large for the bowl. For drinks we only tried the pink cocktail, with acai and blue berries. I did not try it but she said it was very good.\n\nThe ravioli was a single piece which actually was filling, eaten one piece at a time. Very cool how an egg yoke comes out when its broken. The wellington was good, the meat was cooked perfectly, everything else (breading and filling) seemed a bit messy for my taste but was tasty. The mushrooms had very good flavor but I would have like more caps than stems. The kobe steak was very good. The skirt meat was fatty but so flavorful. The stuffed potato was huge, enough for 2 people maybe even 3-4 depending on how much you eat.  \n\nThe 2 things I did not expect and did not like about this restaurant were: 1) there were diners in jeans and tank tops, flip flops, t-shirts, and shorts. This really killed any idea of this being a fancy restaurant. They should require some kind of dress code or at least collared shirts and slacks. 2) The music was way too loud, I could not have a normal conversation with the person sitting across from me. We had to raise our voice way too much.\n\nOverall the experience was good. With the many choices in Vegas I will most likely not come here again but it was cool to try just to say I have."

On our last night, we were tired of bopping and shoving with the crowds and thought it best to stick close to \"home.\"  Part of our decision included a ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower after dinner.  We decided at the very last minute to eat at Gorden Ramsey's.  We had read other reviews about people waiting weeks in advance to get a reservations so were knew what to expect when we got there.  Weren't we lucky that they did barely just have room enough for the two of us at the bar to eat (menu is the same as at a table) without a wait on a Friday night.  Luck-ee.  \n\nAll of the bartenders were friendly and went out of their way to serve and make casual conversation while we were at the bar.  My husband ordered a martini and was quite impressed when he was asked if he wanted it shaken or stirred.  We both had the small petites which were cooked to perfection and were very good tasting. We also ordered a side dish of the purree Yukon Gold potatoes which were very nicely done. The presentation was outstanding and we'd gladly drive back here (five hours by car)  just to eat here again.  Yes, we thought it was THAT good.  \n\nI especially enjoyed seeing how classy and sexy all the ladies were outfitted in their sparkly sequined uniforms.  Even the gentlemen (managers?) were in suits with ties. I thought that also was a real nice touch.  The alternative style background music (which I don't normally enjoy) seemed to only add to the ambiance. Some of the nicer restaurants we eat at at home have gotten away from some of these extra touches. \n\nOverall, this was a wonderful evening and we can thank Gorden Ramsey's Steak Restaurant for this experience.  Bravo, Gorden keep up the great job!!!!"

Wife wanted Beef Wellington but she does not like any pink so asked for med well. Was told it only comes med rare so I ordered it and she ordered steak med well. My Wellington was actually med to med well so I shared with wife. Her steak came rare! Staff apologized and cooked a second one to order and did comp her steak. Also got 2 comped deserts that were great. Glad we went but not enough to return. All in all 2 suggestions. 1) consider music that enhances dining 2) prefer servers to be unobtrusive. There are so many servers running around it creates stress not pleasure."

            "review": "We came to Las Vegas in route to Oregon for our move. My wife and kids couldn't wait to eat at one of Gordon's restaurants. I was anxious as well. We had a reservation @ 7:15 and were seated on time. Good start I thought, but then our meal came out. My daughter had the filet, cooked to order and she was happy. My wife ordered the lobster Wellington, she too was happy. My son ordered the slider appetizer with the Mac and cheese. The sliders were about the size of a half dollar, which seem really small to me. Then I got my New York strip. All of the years we've watched his cooking shows, I thought man I can't wait to tear into this. What a huge disappointment.... The 18oz steak was about 10oz of raw fat. I never took a bite. I showed the waiter and he immediately took it back. Meanwhile, someone else came by and took my knife and fork. My family was steadily eating while I watched. 20+ minutes later I asked to see the manager.. Shortly after, he showed up and so did my steak. I was really upset that there was no urgency to make my experience any better. He apologized and was willing to comp the steak. I again never took a bite out of the steak. I didn't want my Gordon Ramsey steak experience to disappoint. They did offer a doggie bag, which is ridiculous, to say the least. The manager gave his card; one that he wrote his name on and said if your ever back in town, he would take care of me. How this steak ever got past the line beyond belief. Gordon would be pissed and so am I! Redemption is the last thing I'll order from where I thought was going to be epic!!"

First of all staff is top of the line, in true Ramsey style, if your not in the mood for steak I would say dont waste your time here as the expirence is worth the whole thing.

It was my first time here but hubby had been here before and loved it. Trendy decor and cute story about going through the Chunnel from Paris to London when you're being seated.\n\nExcellent service at the table! The hostesses aren't the most consistent, but the table service is excellent. Nice explanation of the menu and steak cuts.\n\nThese are the highlights and what I would definitely recommend getting:\n- Beef Wellington - it's the signature item and sooo good. The layers are perfect and the meat inside is incredibly flavorful\n- Sticky toffee pudding - another classic dish that totally lived up to the hype. Definitely good for sharing after a big meal.\n\nBread service is lovely with a nice variety to choose from, and we also enjoyed the salad to start (not unique, but a nice starter if you need vegetables).  The Mac and cheese side is totally the way to go with your steak.  Rich and creamy with a good firmness to the pasta.\n\nSolid 4 stars and worth a stop if you're in Vegas!\n\nDinner runs about $100 pp without alcohol."

Thank you Mike!\nOur server Charles was awesome. He knew the menu, described everything perfectly and gave us great tips.  You rock Charles!\n\nI would have given this place a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the $9 a bottle charge for still water. Really??!! We didn't know that we were being charged for two bottles??  Not cool Gordon!  \n\nWe started our culinary journey with an assortment of bread. Everything was delicious.  The pancetta bread was the best of the four varieties.  The butter was topped with sea salt and gave it a nice little punch and added texture. Nice touch Gordon!\n\nCharles surprised us with a little something to open our palate. The Amuse Bouche - scotch is a soft boiled quail egg over a bed of red wine braised cabbage.  The egg had a slightly crunchy shell and the yolk was a perfect consistency. The cabbage cut right through the fatty protein and gave it a nice clean crisp finish. Amazing!\n\nThe four of us ordered 3 steaks and shared. It was still too much and we had leftovers. We ordered all steaks medium rare and all had a nice pink center.  The American kobe rib cap was our favorite. It had a nice char with a crispy flaky layer. We cut through it like butter. The meat had a different texture to the other steaks."

Just to get some salads, soup and basic food. It's terrible!

First we arrived about 15 minutes before the reservation and sat down in the elegant bar area.  We both ordered martini's which were beautifully made and delicious.  The bartender was super friendly and very personable.  We were almost sad to leave the bar to go eat dinner.  I recommend arriving a little early to have that romantic drink with your significant other at the bar!  We were then escorted to the 2nd floor and sat at a table close to the edge so we could see down into the 1st floor dining area.  I really wanted to sit on the 1st floor so I could see the chefs preparing the food but I didn't complain.  I'll ask for a table on the first floor next time.  The atmosphere was great!  The waiter explained the menu and then told us a steak trolley would be by to explain the steaks.  While waiting we reviewed the menu and quickly knew we wanted to try the Hells Kitchen tasting with the wine pairing.  I believe the cost was $145 + $75 for the wine pairing.  Yes, it's expensive but so worth it!  Here's what we had and my opinion:  Scotch Egg - Amazing!  Roasted Beet Salad - Amazing!  Scallop Risotto - Did I already say amazing?!!!  Roasted beef Wellington - Amazing again!  Dessert was Pear Tarts - Really delicious!  The only negative I could even say is portions are small as can be expected.  My wife and I are small people so we were very satisfied regardless.  Highly recommend if you are willing to pay!"

If you love steaks, this place is for you.  They have Kobe beef, dry-aged beef, and the most delicious sticky pudding dessert ever!\n\nEverything I tried was excellent.  They started off by giving us these tiny, scrumptious little breads that just leaves you begging for more.  And I'm not even a bread person.  Honestly, I usually skip the bread at most restaurants but not here.\n\nMy steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The side dishes of foie gras (oh yes, I have missed this since they have banned it from California!), bone marrow (two giant bones of succulent goodness!), and a big baked potato with everything on it were outstanding.  And they have the best mac and cheese here.  I'm not a mac and cheese fan but I could be if all mac and cheese tasted this good.  \n\nI even tried someone else's chicken entree which was amazing.  It had crispy chicken skin and a lovely rice that was quite tantalizing to my palate.  But that did not prepare me for the most amazing dessert.  A sticky pudding with ice cream.  The pudding itself was outrageously heavenly.  I don't recall what kind of ice cream was on the menu description but it surely tasted like salted caramel to me.  Oh yum!\n\nI love this place.  My only regret was not bringing a couple of bottles of my own special collection wines.  However, the wine we ordered was outstanding.  The sommelier was gracious and helpful yet not stuffy.  The service here was outstanding from top to bottom."

I wanted to go to a GR restaurant for my first Vegas trip and I certainly picked one of the most expensive. That's the only warning, it is very expensive even at Las Vegas standards. My husband loves steak and got a filet \"Oscar style\" (an additional $54 in itself) but said it was worth it. Cooked medium and loaded with king crab on asparagus, he truly loved the dish with a loaded backed potato on the side. I was flexible with my menu and got the fish and chips since I strictly do not eat meat. The fish and chips were good, maybe a little less in flavor and could have used more sauce, but i still enjoyed it. I rarely eat fish so take that with a grain of salt. The Mac and cheese was amazing. I recommend that for a side dish. The drinks were strong, the service was fantastic down the very last second, and even though we took no leftovers the server still gave me a Gordon Ramsey gift bag to take home. I would recommend this restaurant. Be sure to make s reservation."

The ribeye was huge and the ribcap melts in your mouth. The filet was a good balance of fat and texture. Our sides were asparagus, creme corn, mac and cheese, and fingerling potatoes. We had one tough asparagus and the corn had a bit too much bourbon. Otherwise, the sides were good. For dessert, we had the toffee pudding cake and the peanut chocolate bar. The toffee date cake was as good as others have mentioned and the peanut chocolate bar was super rich. I think there should be complementary coffee for that dessert.

The antioxident was very tasty with acai liquor and lemon,\n\nThree people ordered the wellington and we waited the 45 mins.  I don't love red meat but when in a steak house I can't eat the fukishima Pacific salmon can I?\nThe filet was as expected perfectly cooked and lovely.  People loved their wellington, though commented that is is slightly over salted.  I expect that from American cuisine though.\n\nMy complaint is that the mac n cheese with truffle was delicious, though salty,  the side of asparagus for $13 dollars was cool.  In fact all my food felt like it was not hot but like it rested for ten mins.  \n\nThe male waiter parade for food service was fun.  6 men bringing food. Though the forgot 2 items.\n\nI had the french press coffee which was over cooked.  It shouldn't be longer than 4 mins.  When I quizzed the waiter on serving time he didn't know.  The chocolate served with it was cool. very European.\n\nOverall people were satisfied.  For such fine dining at over $100/pp  I expected excellent food service and hot delicious food.  None was provided.  Very average.  It felt more touristy delicious and not foody delicious.  I want a mouth orgasm!! \n\nI would pass next time.  Though good no one craved a return experience"

This is exceptionally difficult to make correctly, and it's as delicious as it looked on the youtube video. THE ONLY WAY TO ORDER THIS IS MEDIUM WELL! It's worth the HALF HOUR wait, trust me! You won't be disappointed!\n\nAlso, for dessert, ordered the sticky toffee Pudding. This was probably the absolute most tastiest, sweetest dessert, I've ever had. It's an ABSOLUTE must have. The butter-ice cream is a nice contrast to just how sweet the toffee pudding can get, by giving your taste buds a baseline from bite to bite. Can serve two people, but I ate the whole thing!\n\nCheck came out to about 92 dollars plus a fifteen dollar tip, you'll be spending over $100 dollars per person, if you add on any additional sides/dessert to your main course.

Bill came out to around $190 before tip for two drinks, appetizer, two entrees, a side, some foie butter, and dessert! Craftsteak set me back $450 for about the same portion!\n\nSmoked Beef Tartare: \nLemon Zest, Red onion, Capers, White Anchovy Aioli, Cured Egg Yolks, & Yukon Gold Herb Chips. This was definitely a different twist on the many tartares I've tried. It's served with this glass bowl on top and the server takes it off to let you smell the smokiness lol, cool presentation. More chunky and citrusy than I'm used to but with every bite I liked it more and more. However, no one has yet to beat the Tartare I've had at Sage. $21\n\n18 Oz Bone-In New York Strip:\nAged for 28 days in their Himilayan Salt Room. My boyfriend had this one and it was nothing short of amazing. And 18 Oz for around $60?? Wow what a great deal. It wasn't as tender as some we've had but the flavor was potent and very earthy. I definitely want to try their Japanese A5 Kobe next time. $61\n\nRed Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs:\nI had this entree since I'm not really a steak person (I know I know, there's definitely something wrong with me lol) This was enormous. Wow, I could barely finish half of it! It was exactly the size of my forearm, and for reference, I measured my forearm for you guys and it is 9.5 inches long. The short rib was so tender it basically melt in my mouth and it was served with Potato Puree, Wild Mushrooms and Sauteed Spinach. Can I have this every cheat day please? $41\n\nSide of Foie Butter:\nSo my boyfriend likes this on this steak after first trying the combo with his Rib-Eye at Fleur in Mandalay soo he ordered some foie butter on the side here, and we were expecting a tablespoon or something but they gave us about 5 inch-thick slices served in a mini dish! Oh my gosh! We ended up putting this on everything cause we felt bad wasting and we still couldn't finish it! lol Super flavorful and rich. Only $6!\n\nLoaded Baked Potato:\nThis is basically the king of all baked potatoes. Served with Smoked Gouda Bechamel, Sour Cream, Bacon Lardons, and chives. I have no idea where they found a potato this big. It was on steroids lol and super tasty. The Smoked Gouda is what made this potato over the top. I would be surprised if this thing was under 1500 calories. $11\n\nCoconut Cake:\nI know that everyone recommends the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pops but since he offers that at BurGR as well, we decided to try something different. Coconut Pastry Cream, Pineapple, Toasted Coquiots, with Passionfruit-Guava Sorbet. Super light and flavorful, the perfect ending to such a rich meal. $12\n\nI honestly think this could be in my favorite top 3 restaurants in Vegas behind Sage and Scarpetta. Again, the service in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant is beyond over the top. Everyone was super friendly, always giving more information than they really have to. Basically when I think of service, I think of Gordon Ramsay. Also, I enjoyed the ambiance in this restaurant. Everyone was talking and laughing, having a good time, with music playing in the background. I honestly hate when a restaurant is whisper quiet. I also really loved the intimate booths on the second level. Really comfortable and private while still being able to see all the action downstairs. I can't wait to come here again. Next on my list: his signature Wellington, Wagyu Carpaccio & Sliders, Kurobuta Pork Belly, Japanese A5 Kobe, or maybe I'll just attack the Tasting Menu :)"

That being said, I had to try this restaurant.\nHubby got us flights, I made the reservation and it was off to LV last Saturday evening for dinner after a family yard sale that didn't even pay for the cab ride!\nWe were seated in a booth that was cozy and gave us a view of the Union Jack and the red squiggly light thingy on the ceiling. We were told it was the knife cuts created while preparing the Beef Wellington. Interesting....\nCool iPad menu for the drinks! Too bad it didn't have pics of the food menu as well. But we got a good look at most of the dishes as they passed us by. I had to try the Beef Wellington since he seems to be such a stickler about the dish on Hell's Kitchen. I've prepared the version on his iPad app but never really had one before that.  The dish was on the Chef's tasting menu so we ordered that, mine with the wine and hubby without. \nThe Amuse was a Scotch Egg. I loved how the velvelty yolk calmed the acid in the red wine braised cabbage. Fantastic with the Champagne\nThe Heirloom Tomatoes were fresh and juicy. The basil crystals were delicious! Very ingenious!\nNext course was the asparagus soup. You know how veggie soups are always overcooked veggies blended with an overpowering amount of butter and cream to the point that the only thing about the soup that's remotely vegetable is the color? Wow! Delicious asparagus concoction surrounding a parmesan custard. The dungeness crab was just enough and the pickled white asparagus gave a bright acidity that matched the beauty of the plate!\nFinally! The Wellington! Cooked perfectly! The beef was so tender and the pastry was cook through. I could've licked my plate but I settled for using the different yummy breads we were given to wipe up the delicious red wine demi glace\nThe Melon Panna Cotta was a light refreshing end to a truly wonderful meal. But we kept seeing the other fantastic desserts pass by so we HAD to try them with coffee.\nFrench pressed coffee with chocolate liquor covered spoons: Amaretto, Baileys and Chambord! Yum Yum Yum! A plate of Bannoffee Tarts and another of Toffee Pudding were placed in front of us and we immediately fought over the Toffee Pudding. OOOhhh so wicked! The toffee that is. The Bannoffee was more of a deconstruction of the actual pie. I would've preferred the actual pie. The bananas were turning black and there was only a smear of the toffee on the plate. \nA truly wonderful dinner to celebrate my 41st!  Our waiter, Matthew, was very attentive and even brought the meat cart to show us what we had missed. So we HAVE to return so I can take a stab at that rib eye! And swim in another bowl of that lovely asparagus soup!"

When we quickly decided on an entree, I was very impressed that our server Donny picked up on the fact that we were in a hurry.  He asked when the show was, and put us at ease that not only would we make it, but that he would also make sure the birthday dessert came out of the kitchen right on time.  I just have to say that, part of the reason I'm so impressed is that we had an amazing meal (seriously, exceptional food) with time to get to the show, but the more surprising, important thing is that we had a server who was perceptive, confident and proactive enough to really make us feel comfortable so we could enjoy the experience.

Also, I liked their menus, it is not a typical open-it-up menu, but all info is one button away on a iPad. haha so clever!\n\nMy friend and I arrived a little earlier than our reservation. We stopped by the bar and I order Pim's this is a girly fruity drink, right up my alley. I am not a heavy drinker and get the asian glow after a couple of sips. This drink was refreshing and light enough for me to handle. Must give this drink a try if you are not a heavy drinker, but want a little something to sip on. \n\nThe two times I've been here were both really enjoyable meals for me. We ordered half a dozen of oysters, they were very fresh and tasty with the sauces they provide along with the appetizer. We also ordered the beet salad, this is very light and refreshing and the beets were cooked nicely. For the main dish I ordered the 8oz American Rib Cap cooked medium rare, you cannot go wrong with this one. It is nice and tender cooked to perfection. I was told that this piece of meat has the most marbles all around, you can really taste it and that's why the meat is so tender, plus the price for it says it all!  For the sides we order the mashed potatoes, and it was very smooth and yummy. Perfection combination when eaten with a piece of rib cap! \n\nIf you are ever in Las Vegas, you should treat yourself to this place. It will not disappointment. I usually will not go back to eat at the same fine dining restaurant again unless it is unforgettable tasty food and I must go back for more! This is one of them, go try for yourself."

The staff was extremely professional and knowledgable on their cuts of meat. They even have a stand with all their different cuts of meat that they bring out and explain each with what to expect with your order. The price on the menu is for the meat only, any side is extra. \n\nI ordered to Rib Cap under the Wagyu/Kobe beef section. It was fantastic. The meat so tender yet the sear offered a great crispy coat. \nMy girlfriend ordered the Beef Wellington and a good friend ordered the 24oz Ribeye. All meat was declared tasty but the Rib Cap took the win for being the best. It ended up costing a good 64 dollars for hat cut, well worth it. \n\nFor our sides we ordered the potatoes, okra, and Mac n cheese. These were also tasty but the meat was the star. I would recommend for a party of three 2-3 sides for the table. Enjoy!"

            "review": "These. These are the best cuts of meat that exist.\n\nBack up a second. Came here for an anniversary dinner just after new year's. Arrived early but were seated promptly anyway. The hostess tells you a goofy story about traveling through the Chunnel from Paris to London and the light fixture being \"Gordon Ramsay's hand movements as he prepares his beef Wellington, our signature dish.\" Right, whatever.\n\nActually I'm glad they dealt with the strangeness of a Brit restaurant inside the Paris Hotel. They revel in it, in fact, with a huge Union Jack painted on the ceiling above the red neon light sculpture. The decor is funky, with chains for curtains, red everywhere, and British rock music playing. I have to say, it really worked for me. Even though it was a romantic dinner for us, the vibe was really great. Fun, friendly, a little punk, but comfortable and classy at the same time. Impressive. Oh, and it's bi-level. Always love a bi-level restaurant.\n\nSo we're given the name of our server by the hostess, because they are hella organized. We also meet the guy who helps our server (basically he pours us water a lot.) All great, friendly, professional people. They put a bottle of water on the table- THANK YOU for that. My husband always runs out of water and steals mine. Problem solved.\n\nThe server brings you an iPad with cocktails and some Gordon Ramsay propaganda. Eyeroll, a bit, but it works, I guess. Then you get a real menu after ordering drinks. Lots of options, but of course the focus is steak, which is brought out to you on a fancy cart with mirrors. They have the American ones and the \"Kobe\" ones (we stuck to American because \"Kobe\" is a pretty meaningless designation). Definitely a neat way to do it, and it actually did help me make my decision.\n\nOn to the food:\n\nBread - they gave us four different breads that were fancy as fuck. More like pastries, really. Two were absolutely to die for: this one that was like a bacon croissant but in a cinnamon roll shape and a multi-grain slice. The butter is of course excellent and tangy. And you can keep asking for more. You probably shouldn't, if you also ordered steak. But you could. And you'll want to. Mm, so good.\n\nAppetizers - We had the warm foie gras (at the time, the ban hadn't been lifted in California, so I felt compelled to order it). The portion size was really substantial, and I was excited that it's served without chips or bread. I thought I was the only person who liked to eat it straight. However I wouldn't say you have to order this dish. If you feel like having foie gras, get it. Otherwise, let it be.\n\nSteak - Beef Wellington for me, the American filet mignon for the husband. I had no idea what beef Wellington was. Now I know. Honestly it's a waste of a filet (the cut they use for it), but I'm glad I tried it. The pureed potatoes that come with it are fracking amazing, holy crap. Definitely order those as a side. The husband's steak was unfortunately cooked medium rather than the requested medium rare (more on that later), but damn, that cut was the perfect piece of meat. The stuff of dreams. Seriously.\n\nSides - Baked potato and truffle blue mac and cheese. That potato was killer. Served with bechamel. I wish I didn't know you could put bechamel on a potato. I'm going to be so fat now. Amazing bacon on that, too. Thick and just perfect (husband complained that it wasn't already cut into little pieces, though). Mac n cheese I wouldn't order again. It's good if you like the drier kind, baked with bread crumbs on top. Personally I like really cheesey, warm, almost soupy mac n cheese.\n\nDessert - Sticky toffee pudding, obviously. It's of course very good, but not any better than at Tea & Sympathy. It's served with a sauce (not the traditional creme anglaise) that's caramely and also brown butter ice cream that looks like a stick of butter- so cute! And the best butter ice cream I've ever had, easily. I'd like to order just the ice cream next time.\n\nEspresso - I can't praise the espresso enough. Probably the best I've ever had- seriously! And they serve the cappuccino with these spoons that have a half ounce of liquor inside chocolate coating. Super cute, super tasty. I wanted to eat all of them, haha. The aroma of their coffee was so intense and beautiful, we could smell it from the table next to us and knew we had to order it, no matter how full we were. And we were very, very full.\n\nRemember that overdone filet? Husband told the manager when he came by, and the guy was just amazing about it. He offered a whole new steak, even though we'd already finished it. We declined, of course, but he came back to tell us he was giving us 25% off our ENTIRE bill! That was basically a free steak and then some. I was amazing. We went in expecting to spend a ton, but it ended up being one of the cheaper dinners on our trip. For reference, full price would have been $260 before tip but including tax.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend coming here and chowing down on BEEF!"

Even the hostesses' and waiters' outfits added to the flawless experience. The whole place has a very cool retro yet futuristic UK vibe.\n\nI am obsessed with basically any Gordon Ramsay show; so while my expectations were very high, my boyfriend tried keeping me back on solid ground. However, the moment we walked in to the time we left, we were blown away.\n\nI started off with the Strawberry Martini (you select your drinks on an iPad) -- it was excellent and surprisingly strong. My appetizer was the British Ale Onion Soup, which was ridiculous. We had to have the Beef Wellington, because it seems to be one of his signature dishes. Holy !@#$%^&*( it was cooked perfectly. You must get it medium rare. Even the freaking salt they use to top the butter and Wellington was delicious. Another noteworthy touch -- a staff member brought us the actual Wellington (before it was cooked and ready to serve) on a cast iron skillet and \"presented\" it to us, saying \"lady and gentleman, I present you with the Beef Wellington the chef is about to prepare for you.\" Damn.\n\nAlexandru (some Romanian guy) was our server. He was super attentive and very classy. Our glasses would never get below an inch from the top, without someone pouring us more water. I had put a tissue on the table and one of the wait staff used another napkin to pick it up. That alone is worth the five stars! Gordon Ramsay's cleanliness and attention to detail was dispersed throughout the entire place.\n\nTo use one of his own quirky catch phrases, Gordon Ramsay Steak is \"the most stunning\" restaurant experience. Meanwhile, we also went to Mesa Grill, Bobby Flays restaurant that weekend, and it was absolutely terrible and flavorless. All Hail Gordon!\n\nIt may sound silly, but this was one of, if not *the* highlight of my trip this Memorial Day weekend. I will be back."

The service was excellent, the staff was prompt and attentive. We did not order any appetizers and dove right into our entrees. The bread selection was great, although the volcano sea salt on the butter  was a little gimmicky and didn't really provide much of a difference in flavor from regular toasted sea salt. My lady ordered the fillet, medium. It was prepared excellently, perfectly pink all the way through. It was delicious. I ordered the rib eye, medium. While being cooked well on the inside, it was very charred on the outside. To the point where every bite tasted like char. The steak generally lacked the flavor you would expect from a $56, 28 day dry aged rib eye. The sides were mediocre at best. The Mac and Cheese had the cheesiness and consistency of Easy Mac (with bread crumbs). The potato pur\u00e9e was ok as well, but nothing special. \n\n\nIf you are looking for an exceptional steak experience in Vegas, I suggest Carnevino at the Palazzo. Their steaks as sides make Gordon Ramsay's Steak look like Outback Steakhouse."

Cool concept how they take you from Paris to London. \n  We decided to end out adventure from San Francisco to Big Sur to Yosemite ending in Vegas with a bang so we enjoyed one of the best meal us and our kids have ever had. We started with american wagyu beef sliders, the cutest slider ever with the huge flavor, a must get. You will be mad you can't get a full size burger. Then the boys got the bone in ribeye and us girls got the kobe beef filet, my daughter tried eating slow just so she could savor it. For sides we went with the mac and cheese, sooooo good we had to order more and the brussel sprouts. After all of that being so full we were going to pass on desert until they mentioned the sticky toffee pudding, which is really a little mini bunt cake with melted toffee that is poured over at the table. We figured we would each have 1 bight, so good we ended up using out spoons as swords to fight for the next bite. \n  Lastly the wine list is on iPads so you can chose by country, type etc. Perfect!"

I made reservations for friday night and while we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated, we got a really nice booth out of it so it was worth it. \n\nWe started off with the pork belly appetizer, which was pretty good. The problem was that the bread and appetizer came out super fast and we had to wait a while for the steaks and the beef wellington. Granted, they told us it would be a long wait but we had to order Gordon's signature dish from 'hell's kitchen.' In addition to the kobe beef filets and beef wellington, we added foie gras to our entrees and fire corn and spinach on the side. I will miss the foie gras in california soon, but I won't miss the corn and the salty spinach. The steaks were sooo tender and juicy, and the beef wellington was a mouthful of goodness. All in all, the main dishes were excellent but the side dishes and everything else were less than average for a fine dining steakhouse. I think they don't focus enough on the sides so there's definitely room for improvement in this area. However, service was pretty sweet and entertaining at the same time so I will bump my overall rating by a point.\n\nFood: 4 stars --- Service: 4.5 stars --- Atmosphere: 5 stars --- Price(value): n/a"

If you are willing to dish out the money,  I suggest you do it right (go big or go home right?) and do the whole experience from apps to wine to thick juicy steak and dessert.\n\nFrom the get go, it is made poignantly clear that YOU are the guest of honor, as a host of servers descend upon your table to take immediate and overwhelming care of you. Furthermore, our server was about one of the best servers I have ever had, with great charm and a genuine interest in taking care of us. Our sommelier was also absolutely fantastic, offering us a great recommendations without trying to blatantly drive the price up on us. Please take advantage of their extensive knowledge and care, as they love what they do, and offer an incredible service that you seldom find in other establishments(its not like your neighborhood Chili's will be offering you inside scoop on the grape variations from the Bordeaux region and which one more perfectly pairs with your \"Top Shelf Enchiladas\") \n\nEverything I ate here was amongst the best or the best of that particular offering I have ever had. The gnocchi, for example, was hands down the best I have ever had, as it simple melted away on your pallet with a symphony of flavors and layers. The entire presentation of their various cuts of beer is truly impressive and you simply can't go wrong, Our table decided to do a mixture so that we may all try the different cuts. I must admit that my personal favorite was shockingly Ramsay's signature dish, the Beef Wellington. They warn you it takes about 45 minutes to prepare, but it is oh so worth it. Across the board, these are amongst the best cuts of beef in the world, and you will surly be on the benefiting side of things. Your taste buds will be treated to a celebration flavors so few are truly blessed to have experienced. \n\nOn to dessert! (and trust me you will not want to skip out on dessert) This is the sweet exclamation point on what is a truly otherworldly culinary adventure. Please do yourself a favor and order the Toffee puddings, and buckle up as your mind is about to be blown! Words can no do this dessert justice, so just take my advice and go for it, you will not regret it.\n\nSo with that, I wish all of you who are about to embark upon this journey a Bon App\u00e9tit, and hope that you enjoy your sojourn as much as I did. Remember, keep an open mind, be adventurous, and for the love of G-d don't wear shorts or sandals to a HIGH END RESTAURANT!  =)"

I had a ribeye steak that was good but was under seasoned in my opinion. I also had a ceasar salad that was excellent onion soup which was excellent but the Mac n cheese tasted only of truffle oil :( a huge let down cause we LOVE macncheese....anyways, more bad....our friend ordered a ny strip steak medium well and when it came out, it was black and I mean black. The waiter told us it was char and was supposed to be that way. Let me tell you, this tasted like charcoal and was not a properly charred steak. She sent it back and the waiter said it would be another 45 mins for another steak. Unacceptable, so we asked for a manager who tried to rectify it by getting another steak out in about 5 mins but unfortunately this time the steak was no more than medium rare and it was supposed to be medium well.... She sent it back again and chose not to order anything else. For an average check of $100-$140 per person, it was def not worth it. I would recommend mon ami gabi in Paris for a steak over ramsays.

We complained to the manager, Tracey Gladson, and were told that \"the chef said the food came out hot\" and \"the customer isn't always right.\" Terrible food, terrible service, definitely skip it!"

It took our server 20 min to bring us menus and greet us and another 30min to come take our order. He never came to check on us not once. And then I decided since I was paying for 5tar dining that I deserved 5 star service, to speak with a manager. I did not get her or our servers name, but she came over and did not even blink an eye when I said I was upset at our service. Nor did she apologize. She did not seem to care one bit. And what made it all the worse is that my best friend (whose birthday we were celebrating) and I, had been waiting 3 years to come here and we're expecting great things. The manager did not even give a complimentary birthday dessert even though the service was disgusting. Oh and when we all ordered water our server was upset and then did not even think to tell us that he was charging us $9/bottle of water and continued to have the busboy pour our empty glasses. It's no wonder all his restaurants in California went out of business, with service like that is expect this one to fall too. At least at Mastro's and The Capital Grille they give you a complimentary dessert for dining with them on your special occasions."

Filling our water glasses ( no, not the 9.00 bottles, thank you for THAT tip, fellow yelpers) ..changing out our utensils as needed, etc.  For an appetizer we ordered the pork belly. It was melt in your mouth delicious! I ordered the bone in rib eye for my dinner and my husband ordered the fisherman's grill. My steak was probably the best steak I have tasted. Maybe something to do with being aged in that salt room? My husband loved the seafood...we shared a loaded potato which was good but not as good as my husband's potato skins with bacon...and then we tried the shiitake mushrooms which were also very good! Lastly, of course,  the sticky toffee pudding to share which I thought was decadent!  I dont know if i will be back, only because there are so many others to try in Vegas,  but it definitely was worth the 200.00!"

I always wanted to give it a try and see what his beef wellington was all about. At $57.00 it isn't cheap but what you would expect for a restaurant like this. It wasn't bad but not what I was expecting. The dish itself is a bit difficult to cut into with the puff pastry and the filet was a bit boring flavor wise. They say it takes 45 minutes to prepare but it came out quicker. \n\nAlso, tried the 24 oz bone in ribeye which was searded perfectly and seasoned well. It was some what rarer than medium rare but no biggie. If I went again, I'd order the ribeye medium. \n\nThe potatoe puree was velvetey smooth and creamey. The mac and cheese was too rich for my taste with a blend of 4 cheeses. The gnocchi was decent andpaired well with all the other ingredients it came with. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is nice and I liked the open long kitchen. But the table we got was a booth facing the kitchen which in normal circumstances would be fine. But all the servers were in front of the kitchen waiting for the dishes from the kitchen so it made it an interesting experience. I overheard a few servers cursing amongst each other while chit chatting which is not what you would expect but whatever. \n\nService was decent and my favorite part was when they bring around the meat cart of all the different cuts of meat on display to show what you'll be consuming. \n\nI thought it could be located in a nicer hotel and it didn't really mesh well with the outside but still a nice interior to treat yourself."

I was really thirsty from the dry Vegas eat but my water glass never went dry. Our waiter knew the menu and didn't miss a beat when taking our order. For dinner I had the Wagyu filet and fries. The wagyu filet was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth with every bite. The fries were also great but a tough heavy on the garlic. My family really enjoyed the potatoes though. They wanted to go back for more. If in town be sure to stop one of the best meals in town."

My mother, who is a simple foodie has a huge love for steak and I'm a sucker for any high end dining experience. \n\nWe didn't make reservations so that's on us. As a result, we sat in the bar at an extremely comfortable sized table with oversized high back chairs. We were loving it already!\n\nThen we were greeted by our server who had no personality what so ever. She was passive and acted as if she was in robot mode. I began my order with a cocktail called the drifter. It was a fresh new age twist on an Old Fashion. Smooth and fresh, it was simply an amazing drink.\n\nFor dinner, I wasn't terribly hungry and the steak tartar seemed like it would be a great pair with my cocktail. It was smoked and sent out under a dome that was lifted as smoke fluttered out. Presentation was spot on, taste failed miserably. Insanely salty, and served with airy potato chips. Nothing was done wrong, just wasn't for me. I give them pass here.\n\nThe problem came with my mothers steak. Now, first let me say I agree a steak should be medium rare. But if you are going to ask a guest how they like their steak, strive to meet their needs. When my mom said she wanted it medium well, the server kept a asking if she wanted it butterflied. So my mother complied and off she went with the order. \n\nThe steak came out medium rare and cut down the middle. Now, maybe I'm mistaken, but everytime I have butterflies a steak or had it done it is split across the center on the horizontal. After a few bites of trying to eat it, the steak wasn't for her so she sent it back as the server kept insisting on taking it. We watched as she handed it to the kitchen and it passed around to 4 people as they looked at it under the light. When it came back, it was charged to a crisp and so over cooked as if they were trying to teach us a lesson.\n\nOn to the sides- the street corn was great but potato pur\u00e9e was COLD. \n\nOur check came out to $165 before tip and was totally NOT WORTH IT.\n\nGo somewhere else to save a disappointment."

This is Gordon Ramsay's signature dish...and the hype was met.  \n- Sticky Toffee Pudding - at this point I was so full that I didn't think there was any room for dessert.  I took a bite...and wow.

The shows, clubs, and casinos are great, but dining here is what stood out the most!\n\nI tried to make reservations online and it told me that all the time slots I selected were unavailable! I REFUSED to give up and just called directly. I ended up getting a 6:45pm reservation which is perfect! Word to the wise it's a 25$ fee for EACH person if you don't make your reservation!\n\nWe were seated upstairs in a dimly lit room, with about 4 large tables. I guess these rooms are reserved for large parties as we had a group of 7. Our service was IMPECCABLE! Drinks were ordered on an ipad, bread was presented to us, and our orders were in quickly! Everyone was looking forward to dining here so we already knew what we wanted. UNTIL our server brought out the different cuts of steak!\n\nI stuck to my guns and ordered the 22oz rib-eye! Mother of GAWD was that an excellent choice! I enjoyed it far more than the wellington, which was delicious in its own right. I prefer to have a bit of fat on my steak! Adds additional flavor! The best part is the fat was nice and CRISPY! My mouth is beginning to salivate as I type this! I was given a hard time for ordering a well done steak but who cares! I don't like my food bleeding all over the plate lol... The steak was juicy and PACKED with flavor! MY GOODNESS! THE best steak I ever had!\n\nThe sides were pretty damn good as well. We ordered asparagus, mac n cheese, loaded potatoes, and a potato puree! The sides are definitely family sized and we shared amongst each other. The mac n cheese was the most memorable to me. Absolutely delicious!\n\nDinner was worth every dime of the $600+ tab! I don't even remember the exact amount. I just handed over some cash haha! Special thanks to the hardworking staff who made our dinner phenomenal!!! I will DEFINITELY be returning the next time I'm in Vegas!\n\nP.S.\nYou don't need ANY steak sauce! My sister ordered the house made steak sauce and it overpowered the deliciousness of my steak! She thoroughly enjoyed but to each is own! That's not to say it was bad but it tasted like bbq sauce to me."

I enjoyed the Scallop & lobster the best, the mussel was the size of a little dime and the fish was a bit bland.

We took a seat at the bar and our waitress was great. When we finally got to our table was where the trouble began.\nI start by saying the sommelier was excellent! While we were discussing the wine menu (very intimidating) he came up and offered suggestions, and throughout the meal was at the table seeing how we were faring. Saw him FAR more than our actual waiter. When the waiter finally took our order that was the last we saw of him until it was time to pay the bill. REALLY. The busboy/man, was far more attentive to us, and continually checked on us to make sure we were ok. There were 2 tables next to us, both with couples dressed to go to a picnic, not fine dining (sorry, pet peeve), and they were fawned over, while we were ignored the entire night.\nWhile the food was excellent, it's really hard to get over feeling like you are beneath your waiter, and get excited when he actually pays attention to you.\nThe busboy/man (I apologize that I don't know his title) was a wonderful man with an African accent and was AMAZING. The main server was horrible. It's really hard to give a 20% tip on a $300 bill for someone you literally saw twice."

These same folks cant fold a napkin when a guest steps away or replace fresh silverware.\n\nNot here.  Very strong, professional yet comfortable service from everyone and at all the tables I saw.   Then they serve some tremendous food and its easy to see why theyre proud it.   We shared a few dishes.   Im a big seafood fan and we started with their platter,   Nothing not to love here, plus their mignonette was one of the best Ive had.   Need a little more cocktail sauce and I like extra horseradish but thats easy to adjust.\n\nThen we had a Bone-in Strip and the Pork Chops and Scallops.  Beautiful with a slight char and a red wine butter reduction.   The shisito peppers are unique, fun side dish.  Followed it all up with a dessert (didnt eat - health reasons) that I heard was great.  That with a coffee that had the ABC (Amaretto/Bailys/Chambord) chocolate dipped spoons and youre pretty golden.\n\nFreddie did a great job and look forward to returning.  Oh they have some fun cocktails from the bar."

So, word to the wise, reserve early.\n\nFOOD: My wife got the 8 oz filet, I got the American Kobe/Wagyu Rib Cap, and we shared Fingerling Potatoes and Mac and Cheese. The steaks tasted great. It's possible they were a little overdone compared to the temp we asked for, but still very good and tender. Mastro's is a really amazing steakhouse in LA, and I don't know if this is necessarily up to par, but it's close, and for those of you that have been to Mastro's, being \"close\" means a lot. The fingerling potatoes were a bit salty if eating them with the steak. The Mac and Cheese, however, was perfect. It had a very good truffle flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. The bread that came out was probably the best free bread you could ever have at a restaurant...creative, tasted great, gourmet bread (is that even a real thing?). \n\nSERVICE: I would say the service was very good. It wasn't anything extraordinarily great, but it was good. I did like the steak presentation. They roll out the cart with the various steaks, and they actually take the time to go over each cut which is really informative and helpful in making a decision. \n\nAMBIANCE: It's a relatively casual place, which some reviewers have complained about. But hey, it's Vegas! Some people spend the day in shorts and sandals gambling, and then head to a nice dinner. Some people dress up for a nice dinner, then go to a show or out to a club. There's a variety of customers and I think at a Vegas restaurant, casual dress/dining at a fancy restaurant is no problem. \n\nThis is also one of those places where they pay very close attention to detail. As we were eating, the table next to us was being set up, and they were measuring the distance from the table to the booth, etc.\n\nAll in all, a great experience, and great food. Would I go back? Surely."

Like....they import their water in from Wales (I really don't understand that...seems extremely wasteful to me....), they present raw steaks on a special steak presenting thing with mirrors on it....whoa.... Also, they give you an ipad to look at the drink menu...this is kind of dumb because the real menu is not on an ipad, so it didn't really make sense. Anyway, on to the food! They start you out with 4 different types of bread...one more delicious than the next, with butter and volcanic sea salt or something fancy. One of the breads tasted like bacon....yum. I ordered the beef wellington and the BF ordered the short ribs and, at the waiter's recommendation, we got the mac and cheese. Well, the wellington was good, but it wasn't amazing. The beef was great, it was very soft, but the crust just didn't have much flavor. The potato puree was very very tasty and so were the roasted vegetables. The BF's short ribs were good, but not as soft as short ribs usually are. The sauce was very good though. The mac and cheese was too bleu chees -y (despite the waiter telling us you couldn't even taste the bleu cheese). Also, the portions were very large, especially for a fancy restaurant. I'm not sure why the waiter made it seem like we needed a side, we definitely did not. We ended up sending the mac and cheese back....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't to our tastes. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was ridiculously good. The caramel was rich and the butter ice cream was crazy good. The presentation was also cute. This place was overall good, but for the price, I didn't think it had enough 'yummyness.' I liked Spago better when I've gone in the past, but this place is definitely an experience and I'd recommend giving it a try."

The filet mignon inside was cooked to medium rare perfection. Shared brussel sprouts, bone marrow, and several other entrees with my friends, and there wasn't a dish that came out poorly. The fisherman's grill was absolutely loaded with seafood, but the tuna was slightly overdone. Ribeye was absolutely ridiculous in terms of flavor and sear. Bone marrow was fatty and rich, and service that night was fantastic in terms of the gift of gab. It was slow, but our waitress had plenty of other tables to get there. The somm also did not reach us until much later in the evening. Also, you've seen so many pictures of this already, but they wheel out a giant wheel of their cuts of beef and explain the seasoning, brining, and aging techniques for each. It's a carnivore's paradise. Obviously, you're going to be paying quite a bit for dinner, but the quality of the food is exceptional, and entrees are still reasonable for a higher-end dinner in Vegas."

My mouth still waters when I remember that slice of beef; cooked to absolute perfection and ooohhh soooo tender! Mom opted for the lamb duo and said hers was the best Shepard's Pie ever! We shared a \"loaded\" baked potato with smoked gouda bechamel and pancetta ham; that was good but I wish we had gone for the truffle mac and cheese.

Some reviews say the decor was tacky, but I actually liked it. We had made reservations and were seated upstairs. It was cool seeing the whole restaurant layout from above. \n\nService was great too. Our water cups were never empty. When you are first seated, you are given an iPad with an interactive drink menu on it. You are also given the limited edition tasting menu that supposedly highlights the dishes made in Hell's Kitchen. The tasting menu also comes with an autographed picture of Gordon Ramsey. If you ordered the tasting menu, you get to take it home as a souvenir. Although I am a fan of the show, all I really wanted to try was the beef wellington so I opted out of the tasting menu. \n\nWe had a show to make so we didn't order much, especially with the beef wellington taking 45 minutes to make. The boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and we also got the brussel sprouts for a side. While we waited for our food, the bread came. \n\nI have to stop here and talk about the bread plate because I can't stop thinking about it!! The bread plate came with four different types of bread: lemon olive oil foccacia, prosciutto brioche, black truffle brioche, and I don't remember the last one. It was served warm, which made it taste even better. My favorites were definitely the prosciutto brioche and foccacia. We devoured the first plate VERY quickly and even though we knew we had to save room for our entrees, we just had to ask for a second plate. SO GOOD. I wish there was a bakery section because I would totally buy a whole batch of the bread to take home.\n\nNow, the entrees. The beef wellington was very good! It was cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender. Make sure to get a little of everything on the plate in each bite because the flavors all go together just right. The fish and chips (truffle fries) was also very good too, fried just right. The portions for both dishes were perfect. We were satisfied, but also not overstuffed. The brussel sprouts side was kind of meh. I think there was too much vinegar in it, but we'll just put that aside and remember the food that blew me away. \n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with my meal and experience here. When you go to Vegas, you are expected to splurge on the food. This splurge was definitely well worth it!"

I am one of those people who dislikes the public persona of Gordon Ramsay.  I'm not sure I would have come here last night but it was one of the food options and I grabbed for the ring and I got the gold one.\n\nI had a few choices from their menu for each course but it was easy for me to order.  For an appetizer, the British ale onion soup.  For the main course, I chose the 24 ounce bone in rib eye.  And for dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I did not order a side, an extra charge, since I would be eating approximately a pound of beef alone.  \n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived shortly before.  A hostess asked me to wait in the lounge area and assured me I'd be shown to my table soon and I was.  Another hostess asked me if I wanted to walk the stairs or take the elevator.  The stairs it was.  She seated me at a small table along the railing which gave me a nice view of the downstairs dining area and a  view of the ceiling with the Union Jack and the neon sculpture.  Coming up the stairs, she explained that the neon was an artist's conception of the movement Ramsay's hands make when he's creating a beef Wellington.  It is very interesting very different.\n\nRichard, one of my servers, brought me their drink iPad.  I politely passed and went with an iced tea.  They only serve bottled iced tea, Republic of Tea, and I was given a choice of three flavors.  The blackberry sage was my choice, a tea I often make at home.  \n\nI gave Richard my voucher for dinner and a few moments later, he brought the Ramsay menu and told me my choices for each of the courses.  I ordered the soup and steak first and waited until later to order dessert.\n\nSome bread was brought to my table and the selection was so different than normal.  There were two lemon thyme focaccia squares, one mushroom truffle mini brioche, a pancetta fig mini brioche, and two slices of Stilton walnut baguette.  On the side of the bread plate was a round of English Devonshire butter with Hawaiian volcanic sea salt sprinkled on top.  Yes!  A restaurant that doesn't hide the salt from you.  I did observe a woman at the next table trying to get some butter without getting a single salt crystal so I understand both sides.  The bread was excellent.  I had one slice of the baguette and one mini brioche--the mushroom truffle.  I knew there was a large steak coming and I wanted to leave room.\n\nThe onion soup was excellent.  I had some of that soup at Ramsay's Pub at Caesars so I knew what to expect.  Rich broth, tasty caramelized onions, and the two slices of Welsh rarebit on top made for a very good start.\n\nThen a runner brought my steak and it was indeed huge!  It had a Demi-glace with mustard seeds.  The steak was done extra rare as I requested.  It was marbled very nicely and it was very tender.  I sat their thinking I must be some kind of glutton as I kept eating and eating until I was almost completely to the bone.  At home, I would have gnawed on it like a dog, but I let my better manners take over last night.  After bringing me the steak, Carlos, my other server, asked if I wanted any salt or pepper.  He appeared a but later with a plate with two containers--one with ground pepper and the other with sea salt!  A second Yes!\n\nLater, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I also had this at Caesars. I wanted to compare it to some STP I had the week before at another steakhouse on the Strip.  There is no comparison.  Ramsay's version wins hands down.  It's a moist pudding cake served with toffee in a metal pourer and a stick of brown butter ice cream.  Delicious!\n\nA note on service.  Richard and Carlos were first rate!  They were polite and friendly.  An above and beyond kind of thing happened when I asked Carlos about the types of bread.  He went to the kitchen, got a sheet of paper, and wrote out what they served.  That was really nice of him and it helped me remember the different things on the plate.  At the end of dinner, Richard gave me a business card with their two names on it and I'll keep it for the future because I will be back.  I have to try some more things on the menu.\n\nBy the way, Mr. Ramsay, I may change my thoughts about you a bit.  I understand that you're public persona is somewhat of a show for TV and that you're much different--read nicer--when not before the cameras in Hell's Kitchen!"

I can't explain how good the food was.  It was just amazing."

We ordered the blue oysters and Brussels sprouts. They brought us these and bread.\n\nThe Brussel sprouts were firm and well seasoned. The oysters were tender and not greasy like I'd expected from a friend food. There were three kinds of bread served - my favorite was the focaccia, though I think she said this was only seasonal.\n\nWe were underdressed and tired so were a bit self conscious but as is the hallmark of a truly fine restaurant, they made it a non-issue. \n\nThe price came in around $75 for our alcohol and all of the food.\n\nThis was definitely a great Vegas experience."

And for a steakhouse to charge such high prices, nonetheless being affiliated with a celebrity chef, I expected my steak to be cooked right the first time around and didn't enjoy my meal. I ordered the New York cut and told the server I wanted it rare. The steak was so awkwardly cooked, on the sides were rare, but as I proceeded on it got more and more cooked. The server didn't really check on us too often. Starving, I proceeded to eat my cooked steak. When our server finally came, my steak was half way done and I told him. I hated the fact he kept calling me \"sweetie\" and made me feel very young. He said \"Sweetie, you should have told me\"... Well I didn't know where the heck he was and I was starving. I cut my steak open and showed the server just how cooked it was, and said shouldn't a rare steak have some bloody juices... Well mine was dry as a cardboard. The server did offer me another steak, but by then I was full and I said that it was fine, but let the chef to know."

I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and we ate at Burgur the day prior.  We had a 7:30 res and arrived on time. We were asked to go to the lounge and wait for our table as it wasn't ready yet. At 8 pm I approached \"Erica\" the hostess and asked if she knew how long it will be until the table was ready, she answered very abruptly and rudely saying they will come and get us when it's ready. There was no explanation and no apology, just attitude.  We were taken to our table shortly after by another hostess who was great. I also was disappointed with the music level, it was so loud that it was hard to enjoy the dinner, it had a very club like atmosphere that took away from fine dinning.  Our waiter Tony was great and very helpful as well and Andrew and Krystal who helped out with a few question and service. It is also disappointing that you cannot get a 6 oz steak, not everyone can eat 10 plus oz's of meat. On a less important point but noteworthy we were not offered regular water, bottled or sparkling only, just something that lessened the experience.  At the end of the evening and a $400 bill the evening was enjoyable but disappointing."

I've definitely had better truffle mac and cheese, but they are much more expensive. The mac and cheese is a side but the portion is pretty generous.\n\nWe also tried the toffee pudding dessert. It is so delicious that we finished 2 despite how full we were. I think i put too much toffee on mine so it's a little too sweet for me, so just don't be too greedy like me.\n\nThe waitress we had was a little sassy and intimidating but she's still nice and welcoming. \n\nOverall, my party had a great time there, and would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try!"

            "review": "Steak is a great passion of mine. It is one of the easiest and simplest thing one can cook, but definitely not easy to master, like sushi for example. With my respect for Gordon Ramsay, when he opened a restaurant called \"Gordon Ramsay Steak,\" I just had to try it. \n\nThe first impression of the restaurant was, LOUD. Really, LOUD. It wasn't just the people, it was the music. The hostess at the door explained about the design of the restaurant and the artwork on the ceiling while walking me and my wife to our table, and I could not understand a single word from her, but it seemed interesting nevertheless.\n\nOur server came to our table and instead of asking about our drinks, he gave us an iPad to \"browse\" through the drinks. And he also gave us a menu for the special course meal, with a picture of Gordon Ramsay on the right that said \"SAMPLE,\" and he said we would get a picture of him that does NOT say \"SAMPLE\" if we get the course. Did they think people would steal the picture if it didn't? It seemed a bit silly and distracting.\n\nWe were left alone for about 3 or 4 minutes trying to figure out how to use the stupid iPad drink menu. It seemed intuitive enough for me, a 25 year old graphic designer, but I doubt the 90% of the age group who spend $200+ on a meal would really appreciate this. And it froze on a screen and I didn't even get to look at anything until a moment before our server came back.\n\nThe course seemed interesting but it was about $165 per person and we wanted to look at the regular menu. I couldn't really understand our server because of the music and his accent so I just ordered a random beer and asked for a regular menu.\n\nI started to get a bit irritated at this point with all the noise and confusing menus. We got the smallest table for two, and we were having trouble even talking to each other. We did go there to try the food, but I expected a more quiet romantic dinner with my wife on our last night in Vegas, not a hipster club night.\n\nBut continuing with my review, we ordered a lot of food. A beef tartar, sauteed mushroom, bone marrow, a New York steak, a foie gras, a filet mignon, and some potatos. Presentation was... great. Interesting, pretty, and original. Taste? All appetizers and side dishes we ordered were fantastic. I wouldn't say everything was the most amazing dish I've ever had, but they all had something unique about them, and even the stuff like mushrooms and potatos became more interesting somehow. The bone marrow and foie gras, weren't anything extraordinary. They tasted like bone marrow and foie gras.\n\nNow the steak, as a self-claimed world class steak critique, I would give it a 7 out of 10. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but knowing that it was the most expensive steak I've ever had, (I think it was $63) it wasn't much different from what I cook at home.\n\nFor the people who think getting expensive steaks at restaurants is a waste, when I tried the NY steak at MESA grill earlier this year, I thought it was THE BEST steak I have ever had and it was definitely something on a different level than my steak. So far, my second best was Ruth Chris's. But I couldn't say the same for the steak I had at Gordon Ramsay steak. The steak at MESA grill and Ruth Chris were both $50.\n\nOur dessert was great though. We had the toffee pudding with icecream as our server recommended it, and it was delicious.\n\nThe overall service was very nice, but in my opinion, that's a given at places this expensive. Our bill came out to be about $260 plus tip.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't come back or recommend this place for the steaks, but I would definitely like to come back to try some other dishes like the famous wellington. Considering the price and the atmosphere, I'd highly recommend the MESA grill instead."

We arrived at the hotel a little early than 7 to ensure we were not late. \n\nWhen we got to the hostess stand, the hostess wasn't very friendly at all. She had a major attitude problem and informed us that we will be seated closer to our reservation time. We went to grab my Total Rewards card to kill time. We checked back in at 7 and there was an elderly couple in front of us. The same hostess was there speaking very nicely to them and offered them to sit at the bar to wait until their reservation time. She even wished them a happy dining experience. When it was our turn, her stinky attitude was back and didn't really say much. She just handed our ticket to one of the girls who took us to our seats. This alone ruined the night as the hostess is the first impression of the dining experience. \n\nAs we got seated, the vibe wasn't what we imagined for a \"fine dining\" place. It was more of a hip and chic place to take a client or pre drinks before dinner. We were greeted by the waiter's assistant first about 10-15 minutes later. He asked us if we wanted water but we just asked for the wine list. The atmosphere was really loud so we could barely hear what he said. We finally met our waiter Donnie. He brought us our menu and took our drink order as well. \n\nDonnie and Reuben didn't seem very excited to be working that night and their energy was contagious and didn't make the experience any better that the hostess. \n\nWe finally ordered our food which was the following:\nHalf dozen oysters \nCaesar salad\nBeef Wellington\nSaut\u00e9ed Mushrooms\n\nThe oysters were good because I was craving it from the beginning of the week. The platter featured each of the different type of oysters offered. 3 types of oysters and there were 2 of each type. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the Caesar salad. Even though it did not come with anchovies, the dressing was very delicious.\n\nWe had to order Gordon Ramsay's famous beef Wellington. Which on this particular I felt was overrated. Maybe it's because Las Vegas is close to Cali but the Wellington was more on the medium well side instead of medium rare. Throughout my entire entree I only had three bites that were moist and deserving of medium rare.\n\nThe waiter tried to sell us on their signature dessert but at that point we just wanted to go. We saw other waiters be more attentive to their tables. It was such a horrible experience that I would never go back. Maybe we went into the restaurant with high expectations but why wouldn't a person? I mean it is Gordon Ramsay. I think these particular employees need to get retrained in their position or just quit the service industry altogether."

This makes me concerned for consistency. \n\nI first visited Steak during a business trip last year, this time I wanted to take my family during our vacation. When we were sat, our server asked if we wanted water, we said yes, as we assumed that like every other restaurant, the water is free..but that was not the case.  We were not told they had imported water (until we asked about it when we got the bill), who needs imported water? During the meal, they kept filling our water glasses, with no mention of a charge or if we wanted to have more of their special water. We were made aware of this when we recieved our bill with $36 charge for water.\n\nWe also purchased cocktails,  and the water costed us more then the cocktails. Just be aware of this when you visit this establishment. \n\nNow to the food. I was not impressed, and my wife (a huge Gordan Ramsay fan) was disappointed.  We ordered the Beef Wellington for two, and it was not seasoned well at all. It was bland, although cooked perfectly. \n\nI do not want to be all negative.  The bread plate was amazing, and our appetizers were wonderful. To end our meal, I tried the Sticky Pudding that everyone was raving about,  and I was blown away. \n\nIf it was not for the water situation,  and the bland wellingtons, it might have seemed like a $300 meal, but unfortunately the quality and service did not meet our expectations.  With so many options in Vegas, I would hesitate to spend my hard earned money here again. \n\nSo to end...the food was just ok...desert was amazing, service was slow, environment was loud, and watch out for the expensive water. \n\nMaybe they can train their staff to clarify that they have imported water, because it was told to us...until we got the bill."

The potato sounded better than it turned out.\n\nThe first server forgot the appetizer. So we went without one. She then neglected to mention flat water was $9 bottle. No biggie had she properly informed us of the options. What bothered me most about the water was that it was brought out to the table already opened. I'm not one to pay for water, however if you are going to pay for water I would expect I to be brought to the table sealed. Otherwise I am left to assume the restaurant could be filling the bottles with tap water in the back and charging me for it. It should be opened at the table same as you would do for a bottle of wine. This was done twice. \n\nThe server also lacked concern for our table. Our glasses were empty for approximately 20 minutes before she noticed. Not the kind of service I would expect from this particular restaurant. \n\nHalf way through the meal the first server mentioned another server would be taking over for her because she had some other things to attend to in the restaurant. I was ok with that because she wasn't doing her job properly to begin with. I was hoping the second server would do better. This was not the case. The second server ignored our table even more than the first. It took the server 30 minutes to figure out we were done with our meal and ask if we would like to see the dessert menu. Due to the extreme wait I was so irritated that I asked for the bill instead of ordering a dessert. \n\nDue to the poor quality of service the restaurant lost revanue in the form of the appetizer and dessert I never received or ordered. The tip also reflected my disappointment. Next time I am in Las Vegas this restaurant will not be on the top of my list because of the poor service I encountered during this visit. \n\nIt was to bad about the service because the food was fantastic.\n\nHad we encountered a different server I believe I could have rated this restaurant much higher."

Sadly Steak doesn't live up to his standards. \nThe restaurant has more of a night club feel it's quite hip and the music volume is a bit high for just dining. \nThe review:\nLabor day weekend and everything was packed. I was unable to get a reservation and ended up dining at the bar. The bar offers the full menu. It was a pleasant enough experience with plenty of room and no one jostling you about. The bar staff were superb.\nThe Menu:\nI started with the smoked kobe tartar. It's an amazing presentation and arrives in a large bowl with glass lid over it that they pumped smoke into. The portion was perfect as an appetizer. The only oddity was the side of potato chips implaed on skewers. I'm not sure what the point was and I left them to the side. I'd highly recommend the dish.\n\nNext up was a 24 oz rare ribeye accentuated with foie gras. Unfortunately this was the let down of the meal. The foie gras was shriveled and over cooked. A shame as that is one of Ramsay's specialties. The ribeye fared no better. The steak arrived slightly overcooked but only by under a minute of cook time. The sear on it was nice. The sad part though was this is one of the toughest ribeyes I've had in ages. The knife could barely work through the cut. On top of that the seasoning was inconsistent; it would alternate between bland and brine.\n\nTo finish things off I had the toffee sticky pudding with brown butter ice crean. This was the star of the meal. A huge slab of gooey over sweet pudding with a nutty/salty brown butter ice cream on the side. The combination of the 2 items was dessert perfection. This is a huge dessert and is best shared amongst friends.\n\nOverall\n it was a pleasant experience the staff were amazing and even with as busy as the place was they were quite attentive and friendly. Being a new hot spot it's suffering some birthing pains. I heard several other diners around me sending their meals back for being over or under cooked.  For now I'd say definitely give them a shot but don't be surprised if there is the occasional hiccup. I think it will be worth a revist in a few months to a year."

Steak was on my mind and Paris seemed to be a nice backdrop for this place.\n\nLocation wise, this venue is shoved in a small nonassuming corner of the Paris casino floor.  Inside reminds me of a weird red hued disco, with a loud music rockbar feel.  Not quite what I expect of a great steak house.  I understand that it is Vegas, and don't expect super formality, but it just didn't feel right.\n\nI sat at the bar and the staff was friendly and conversational.  The food itself was expectedly amazing....go Ramsay standards!  Probably one of the top five best steaks I have ever eaten.  Bone marrow delicious, baked potato nicely done, bread assortment interesting.  Drinks: the Vesper...nicely done.\n\nI should give this place four stars, but in comparison of atmosphere, I would go back to the Pub and Grill.  Its almost as if they should swap venues.\n\nDT."

            "review": "Pretty hard four star restaurant in my opinion, taking into account that this is THE, Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The food was good, but I'll just go down a quick list of things I took notice of. \n\nFirst, the attire for the hostesses was very tacky for a restaurant in my opinion... Especially a classy one like this place. When we arrived for our reservation, we were sent into the bar area to aimlessly await someone to seat us. Inside this place a beautiful. We were seated in this massive booth upstairs which overlooks the downstairs seating area. The waitress arrived in a very classy/cute outfit and also had a helper which was nice.... Kind of like having two people wait on you.\n\nWe were served a variety of complimentary breads to start things off. All of them were wonderful and done very well. I almost felt like asking for seconds.\n\nOur waitress presented us with a custom made cart which was arranged with all the different cuts of beef they serve. We chose to stick with the tried and very true Bone-in Ribeye (med rare), a loaded baked potato side, asparagus and to start the meal... A French onion soup. \n\nThe French onion soup was delicious. I couldn't exactly taste the cheese and there wasn't a crunchy top layer.. But the soup flavors were great and this probably falls into my top two onion soups... The first being Papillon in Fremont Ca. If Gordon Ramsay gave this more of a gooey cheesy top layer with fried bits.. It may beat the best (so far in my experience at least).\n\nThe steak arrived pre-cut and perfectly cooked. I don't get the pre-cut... But it didn't bother me and still tasted amazing. Aged to perfection and had great marbleization. Juicy, tender and thick. I like to gnaw on my ribeye bones so I went to town on that too. A good steak doesn't need anything to compliment it. Just meat and a perfect caramelization.\n\nThe loaded baked is large but wasn't done the best. It came with a sort of country gravy which I didn't care for. No chives, no sour creme and I don't think it even had cheese... But I may be wrong. The worst part for me was that the outside wasn't salty and crunchy how I enjoy my baked potatoes. If I knew this, I would have opted for a different side.\n\nThe asparagus was perfectly cooked... But lacked much flavor besides the flavor of asparagus... Which is fine if that's all you really want. I like mine with a roasted/grill flavor or at least some garlic and seasonings, so that would have been nice.\n\nOf course our meal wasn't complete without a dessert. we ordered the Coconut Cake which had pineapple and passion fruit-guava sorbet. This dish was very nicely done! Light, flavorful, not too sweet and unique. I definitely recommend trying it.\n\nOverall our experience was good. The ambiance was nice, the food was good, the steak was even better and I would not hesitate at spending $150 for another steak dinner here at Gordon Ramsays Steak."

Like other reviewers I thought the music was much too loud for casual conversation. Since this was a business dinner I would have preferred a quieter environment. Wait staff was professional and friendly. Steak presentation had a good variety of cuts available. I was hesitant to order the Beef Wellington only because of the 45 minute cook time. I was pleased that I selected it as it was excellent and didn't take that long to prepare. The onion soup was also very flavorful. I will not plan on returning for a business dinner. However for a great dinner with friends or family I would recommend it. The bill was $575 (before tip) for four appetizers, four main courses, two sides, one bottle of wine, two cocktails, and one desert. Not completely ridiculous but definitely a premium to other comparable high end steak houses. To summarize, if you're offered to have a meal here that someone else is paying for you NEED to go. However if you want to treat a good customer to a fine meal and discuss business there are some better options available in Las Vegas."

When ordering your steak, they presented a cart of their cuts of meat for you to see & each was throughly explained to us. The food was phenomenal. We had the pork belly & their delicious bread platter as the appetizer. The pork belly was so tender. The beef Wellington & steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection. We spilt the fingerling potatoes, asparagus, & potato pur\u00e9e as sides. It was enough to share among the table. (Table of 4) For desert we shared the sticky toffee pudding. It was served warm with brown butter ice cream. Everything was delicious."

I've always been a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and his shows, so when I saw that his steakhouse was not too far from our hotel, I knew it would be the place to go.\n\nWe made the reservation online through the website (although I see they also have it on Yelp) and ours was set for 5:00 on Sunday. Normally I wouldn't eat this early but we had to go back to our hotel for the Cirque show at 7:00. There were actually a decent amount of people in the restaurant already, considering they had only opened a half an hour before we got there. The restaurant overall is really beautiful, and everything definitely looks fairly high end.\n\nLooking at the pictures and noting the prices, I figured that everyone coming in here would be dressed nicely. But I guessed wrong. Maybe it's different because it's Vegas, but there were quite a few people dressed in jeans. Paying close to $100 per person for dinner. But hey, that's just me.\n\nI had to get the beef wellington since it's Ramsay's signature dish and it was amazing. The previous reviews mention it being soggy but mine wasn't at all, and I felt like it was a fairly good portion size as well. We opted to get the apple tart for dessert and that was spectacular. Had like this caramel sauce over it with ice cream. Possibly the best thing we had all night.\n\nThe service we got was excellent as well. I've never been to a restaurant where they have a wait staff, and then they have assistants. I guess that shows the kind of places I've been to. But between the two people we had, they were very attentive and made a few recommendations as well. Overall, an amazing experience and I wouldn't hesitate to come back when we're in town again."

            "review": "What can i honestly say about Gordon Ramsey Steak that hasn't been said before! I mean seriously....WOW.....just...........WOW! I have been meaning writing a review about GR for sometime now because i went back in mid June and had an absolute time there!\n\nFirst let me start off about getting there and finding this magical steak-land! So myself and 3 other friends planned our yearly trip to Las Vegas, and we were all looking forward to going, because all of us needed a vacation and get away from it all! As is tradition, every time we go to Vegas we always try out a new steak house, because come on, its Vegas! This year i was researching and planning where to go eat and which steakhouse to eat at. I decided on two, first was Mastro's at the Aria and The Strip House at Planet Hollywood, those were my only choices because Ive heard great things about them and wanted to try it. So a few days go by and I'm watching Hell's Kitchen on TV. and from there i always google what I'm watching for some strange reason, and unbeknown to me i saw a link under Hells Kitchen that said \"Gordon Ramsey Steak Las Vegas\", i was like \"whaaaaaaaaaat?\" I was excited and looked up the steakhouse and found that it looked amazing and we just had to try it! It was only 2 weeks away from our trip and i got right on the phone to make dinner reservations on a Tuesday at 8pm. From there we were set and ready to try Gordon Ramsey and experience what the hype was about because it just opened around May.So the day comes where we finally get to Vegas and our steakhouse awaited! We all got ready to out and dressed to impress, as is what you do in Las Vegas! SO now to finally talk about the restaurant haha! \n\nWe arrive at our scheduled reservation time and the Host told us that their tables were running a little behind and we had to wait about 30 minutes. To be honest that's the only thing that bothered me, because you would think a place as esteem as Gordon Ramsey would not be irresponsible like that, but anyways the thing that saved it for me is that while we were waiting playing some roulette to kill time, the Host found us on the gaming floor and really tried his best to get us a table ASAP, and he did, he actually tried, which was amazing! we didn't even wait the 30 minutes as expected. We finally get seated and the service was already amazing! Our waiter was very well mannered and polite and was extremely attentive! We ordered our drinks from this really cool ipad menu which i thought was awesome! Kudos to that! We ordered a couple martinis and a bottle of wine, and i thought the coolest part was once you finished your glass, out of nowhere some ninja waiter with a bow tie spawns out of nowhere and refills your glass, i am not even kidding, he seriously just came out of nowhere hahaha! \n\nNow to the food- (Yes i know its a very long review, but this place is so amazing i just have to) I ordered the 24oz bone in ribeye medium rare with a side of foie gras and the mac and cheese, my other friend ordered the same thing except with a side of fingerling potatoes, another friend ordered the new york strip with a baked potato, and lastly my other friend order the beef wellington with sauteed mushrooms. Some time goes by and we finally get our food, and at first glance we just knew that this was going to be an amazing meal! My steak was cooked and chard to perfection, it was tender and juicy and very flavorful and i also tried to house made steakhouse which was a treat to me! Now the mac and cheese O.....M....G!!!! it was fantastic! it had truffles for God Sake! the steak was awesome but i could have survived on the mac and cheese alone, it was that amazing! It was just like that scene from Ratatouille when the critic takes a bite of the ratatouille and has this flashback of when he was a child, that's how it felt when i took a bite of the mac and cheese! I tried my friends sides and they were just as great! \n\nEverything from the food and service was just fantastic! Seeing how i took the time to write this review, it says that this place is worth going if you are ever in las Vegas! Now I'm going to end this review and i have a lot more to say, but it will eventually turn into a college thesis haha! Over all you must go! at least once in your life and you will truly not be disappointed! I give you my word on that, and i hope that would be enough.........."

Last time I was in Vegas I had the tasting menu at nobu, this time I am having the steak at Gordon Ramsay. I was going to give it 4 stars, but after some thought I feel it should be 5. The average price should be about ~$100 per person if you steer clear of the caviar. I don't feel like the tasting menu was worth it because I'm not a huge fan of beet salads. The HK antioxidant drink was good and worth it, and do not leave WITHOUT having the toffee dessert!"

First, the dining room and the upstairs rooms are loud, and lack any \"charm\" or comfortable setting feeling. It's loud downstairs and upstairs it's like you're eating in someone's closet. It gets worse.\n\nIt's expensive, $66 for a ribeye steak, not atypical for Las Vegas, but at this price range and supposedly reputation of Gordon you expect a great steak. NOT!  Medium well came rare. Oh, and it followed the other two guests dinner by five minutes because of some unknown reason. Nothing worse than sitting there not having your food and having your guests waiting to eat theirs because you don't have yours yet.  \n\nBaked potato. Pretty simple preparation. Our $10 big potato came with five marble sized black areas inside the potato. Obviously it was spoiled or bruised or something. We asked the waiter and he said, \"oh, that's sometimes typical\". Really, I've been eating potatoes most of my life and I've never seen one with five large black spots in it. The correct response should've been, \"i'm sorry, let me get you a new one immediately\".\n\nBy the way, we never saw our waiter, our original waiter from the time he took the order only until he presented the bill. We had to flag down others.\n\nThe other meals, a steak and ahi tuna were OK, nothing special, but nothing special to warrant the high prices. If you're going to charge $50 and up for an entr\u00e9e, make it a $50 entr\u00e9e.\n\nI've never eaten in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. And I WON'T ever again.\n\nHe's got a captive audience at the Paris Hotel and perhaps the vast majority of people, as evidenced by the ratings, are OK with a mediocre experience and food. Sad ...\n\nSo many BETTER choices in Las Vegas. If you want a GREAT steak and experience, go to Morton's or Capital Grill."

Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we made reservations at his \"Gordon Ramsay Steak\" restaurant, in the Paris hotel. \n \nMy husband wrote a great review of our experience but it wouldn't fit here.  So this is the condensed version.  We had a reservation on a Thursday night for 8:15.  We arrived on time and were told by the woman in front that it would be 10-15 minutes.  Go wait in the bar.  No I'm sorry, nothing, not even a smile when we walked up to her.  We were later told by a manager her name was Danielle.\n\nWe went into the bar and it was packed and had to stand.  15 minutes later a couple that had an 8:15 reservation left and we took their seats and ordered a drink.  My husband went to check with Danielle who held up her hand in an impatient \"stop talking\" manner,  and informed my husband \"You are the next to be seated\". Then immediately turned her back on him.\n\nThen the people next to us who had an 8:30 reservation were seated.  I got up to talk to Danielle who was quite rude to me as well and informed me that \"someone\" was in there looking for us.  Apparently when you arrive Danielle writes down what you look like and when it's your turn to be seated she gives your description to a young girl who has to come in an find you.\n\nFinally a young girl got us, at 9:00 for an 8:15 reservation.   I'm sure Danielle had forgotten about us and couldn't be bothered to apologize for her error.  We told the young woman you got us how displeased we were.  She had nothing to say and looked very uncomfortable.  We were seated and at this point I told my husband I just wanted to pay for our drinks and talk to the manager.  The waiter came and we told him, he apologized, first person to do so.  Then another man came up we told him the whole story, nope he was not the manager.  Finally the manager came up and by this time we were really upset.  He offered us a table near the kitchen.  There was no way I was going to spend several hundred dollars on dinner.  We had to repeat we just wanted our check, he comped us for the drinks.\n\nSo be aware, reservations mean nothing at GR Steak. We watch all of Gordan's shows, he always preaches STANDARDS.  Apparently he needs to teach some to Danielle and the hostesses of GR steak."

He is a retired gourmet chef and absolutely loved everything just as much as my wife and I.  The foie gras he said was the best he's ever had at a restaurant before and he's traveled the world.  The best moment of the night was the epicurean orgasm on the first bite of the sticky toffee pudding.

I will say that the Foie Gras appetizer was better than most - the pistachio crumble and sunchoke pur\u00e9e were a nice touch. \n\nMy steak was ridiculously undercooked. I asked for medium rare and this steak was practically purple it was so rare. My dining companion said it looked like raw tuna.  I tried to say something, but our waiter hardly paid attention to our 2-seater table and we had an event to attend so couldn't wait longer for another steak to be cooked. You think the waiter would have asked whether I liked it when he picked up the plates and saw it was practically uneaten. The whole time I was looking at the steak, I kept thinking of how Gordon Ramsey would have reacted in MasterChef and wished I could muster the courage to do the same! Granted, it was a Tuesday night, so maybe the kitchen didn't have their \"A\" team working that night. Nonetheless, for the price paid, the steak should have come out as ordered."

After waiting for almost and hour for the dish I was somewhat disappointed. The flavor was \"average\" compared to their Kobe steaks. Also surprisingly I found my cut to be a little chewy. The seasonal key lime tart was outstanding!!! It was like I was eating a piece of art. That alone made my visit worth it. I can now strike the Beef Welly off my bucket list. Be aware that this dish takes forever to be made. It's not HK where Ramsay expects the order within minutes. Next time I visit there, I will have to stick with what I know. The servers at the bar (and all the employees there) give great service."

He made our dining experience memorable with his fast and personable service. He offered to take our picture when our food came, he cracked jokes with us and he came back at the end of the night to tell us we were his favorite table. \n\nAs for the food: I had the bone in Rib-eye which was one of the best steaks I've ever had! My cousin had the rib cap which was superb! The chicken and the porkchop were also delicious, as were our sides of haricot vert, asparagus and potatoes. We were all pleased and stuffed. \n\nAnd then the dessert came. STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. OH MY GOODNESS. It was just pure amazement. I took a piece of the warm cake, added a spoonful of the ice cream (shaped like a stick of butter!) and as soon as I tasted this concoction, the clouds parted and the heavens opened up to a joyful choir. It was pure bliss that I didn't want to end. It's one of those foods that reflexively make you eyes close and your lips hum out \"Mmmm\". \n\nI cannot wait to go back to Vegas just for this dessert!

The menu warns of a 45 minute cook time so I called the hostess two hours before our reservation to ask if I could pre-order the beef wellington due to time constraints with our schedule. The hostess said I could pre-order but she suggested I order it as soon as I'm sat down & assured me I would be accommodated. Upon our arrival, I tried to order my beef wellington as soon as we were sat but the waiter said he couldn't take my order early. He said our entire table had to order at the same time so all our food would be timed correctly. I whined & challenged but finally gave up because it was clear I wasn't getting my way so I ordered it & was again told I couldn't have what I wanted. I wanted my beef cooked medium-well but the waiter said his chefs wouldn't make a medium-well beef wellington. I'm pretty sure the talent in a Gordon Ramsay kitchen could have figured out how to make me a medium-well beef wellington but instead I got a hunk of raw meat wrapped in bread. We ordered salads, bread, & the seafood appetizer that came in a wonderful but GIGANTIC octopus platter. As the food, drinks, & bottle of wine started coming you could immediately tell the table was too small for four people & all the plates & glasses. With everything on the table it was difficult to carry on a conversation & make eye contact. The Management staff needs sit at their tables, order their restaurant food, & determine \"How many people can eat at this size table comfortably?\" For dessert, I ordered the cheese plate \"to go\" & the waiter said he was not allowed to box up the cheese plate \"to go\". He said he would bring the cheese plate to our table, come back to our table after a few minutes, pick up the cheese plate, & box it for us. The bill was over $700.00 & I was totally disappointed & based on what I've seen of Gordon Ramsay on TV, I believe he would be very disappointed with my experience at his restaurant. :( !!!"

The steak was very good, good exactly to order, the salad was good but a little dry so I got some extra dressing on the side, the baked potato was huge but mediocre at best. Bread choices were tasty, one special drink was quite tasty also. Total tab including the one drink $125(this was for the regular filet not one of the Kobe steaks that they push really hard at you). The restaurant was noisy, the waiter a bit pretentious and obnoxious, and the seating poor as we were place next to the kitchen where wait staff was literally running in front of you constantly. This was my sister's birthday, it was a sunday evening, we made reservations saturday morning and were assured they would do something special and also seat us in a great location in the restaurant. When we complained of the seating we were told we were out of luck that the table in front of the kitchen was it-essentially take it or leave it. So folks I too watch Hell's Kitchen and the other Gordan Ramsay shows, but for my money this place didn't pass....I am certain that what we experienced didn't meet up to the Gordan Ramsay standards. For the amount we spent there are lots of nicer places with great food on the strip. Paris hotel failed here."

Being it December, I decided on coming back to have another Beef Wellington since it seemed like the perfect meal for the holidays.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food was top notch, my waiter almost killed the experience because he was pretty slow and at times was no where to be found when I needed him.  The most bizarre part was how I sat at my table for a good 20 minutes without a menu.  Not a big deal, since I already knew what I would be ordering, but I just thought it was strange how I wouldn't have a menu right off the bat to look at.  My waiter did do what he was scripted to do like explain all the meats from the cart (The Meat Wagon! --  http://bit.ly/1h8BxQw).  It's still impressive to look at, but if you've been there before like I have, it does drag down the ordering process for me.\n\nWith all that said though, I still had an amazing meal.\n\nKurobuta Pork Belly -- http://bit.ly/1c2cjnM\nw/ cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus\nThis was a really good appetizer to start off with.  The pork belly just melted in my mouth like butter!!  Interesting take on a southern dish.\n\nBeef Wellington -- http://bit.ly/19j6hfQ\nStill the best tasting Beef Wellington I've ever had.  Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!  Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was juicy and full of flavor.\n\nFrench Press Coffee -- http://bit.ly/1hGdgBV (pic from my last review)\nSame coffee and and flavor spoons as my last visit.  This time I used both the Amaretto and Baileys flavor spoons.  Still was a great way to cap off my meal.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good dinner but the service from my waiter was under par.  It's really too bad I have to downgrade to 4 stars, but maybe next time I come by I'll have a more attentive waiter.  Still worth visiting if you're in Vegas and want a great dining experience."

All perhaps too distracted by their next TV show or book deal to maintain the standards that brought them notoriety. \n\nThis is so NOT the case with Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris on the Vegas strip. \n\nFrom the moment that I was greeted and escorted inside via \"the tube\".  I had a feeling or perhaps sort of a cautious hope that good things were in store. \n\nBeing a fan, I ordered the Hells Kitchen Tasting Menu which comes with a take home menu and autographed picture of Chef Ramsay in a little folder. Pretty neat and we haven't even ate yet. \n\nBread was first to come out and the selection of four types of still warm bread gave the meal a huge head start (star-wise). Each was delicious. \n\nThe from there the meal was a big crescendo. \n*Scotch egg- perfectly cooked w yolk still soft. \n*Scallop risotto- perfectly seared scallop on creamy, just right risotto. \n*Roasted Beef Wellington-  My first Wellington!  And the high standard to which all others shall be held. Tender, moist, perfectly seasoned to accept the compliment of the demi-glace. (I believe that's the last time I use \"perfect\" in this review. \n*Sticky Toffee Pudding- I'm not a big dessert guy but I've been having some stelar sweets this trip and the STP at GRS is ridiculously, plate-scrapingly good. Seeing it on TV, you can only imagine how good this is. \n\nPrime ingredients. Properly prepared and presented with caring and skill.  Served by by a staff that elevated a great dinner to a true dining experience. My server Donnie and the front of house staff did an awesome job. I truly felt welcome and at ease. \nThey really do a good job of taking the masterpieces created in the kitchen and presenting them beautifully. \n\nProps to the whole crew and congrats to Season 10 Hell's Kitchen winner Christina Wilson!"

Baby beet salad w burrata, seared foie gras w gooseberry jus, pork belly w cheese grits, and their signature app scallop risotto which was originally only on the tasting menu but now offered a la carte as well. Be forewarned, while the 2 scallops were perfectly cooked, the risotto was just ok, but definitely not worth the $64 for an appetizer. I knew that this is a $$$$ and willing to pay top dollar for amazing food but was a bit sticker shocked on check to see the prices of items that were not on menu that we ordered. The 3 sides we ordered Mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and siracha broccolini were generous portions to share for the table. We ordered the rib cap, American Kobe filet, and the beef Wellington and all were excellent and well prepared. For dessert, we had the pannacotta and the sticky toffee pudding. Sticky toffee pudding is a must try esp w the brown butter icecream! It was the best one I ever had and not overly sweet. (I did ask for sauce on side) I would definitely come back but will know better to ask for pricing on any non menu items (even though it sounds cheesy) or just not order it."

Ever.\n\nI was so excited to finally eat at Steak since, like most people who go out of their way to eat here, I am a huge fan of the great Gordon Ramsay. Going in, my expectations were pretty high and they were met above and beyond my expectations.\n\nI had a party of 4 and made reservations a few days before. We had to wait a little bit by the bar before being seated at our table, but the ambience was so great I didn't mind at all!\n\nWe were seated in a matter of minutes and were immediately taken care of a charismatic, friendly, and knowledgeable waiter. He was extremely professional and attentive throughout our meal. \n\nThe complimentary bread was out of this world so naturally we polished it down in 30 seconds flat...and our server offered us more! That was really unexpected in the most pleasant way possible. Here's what we ordered:\n\nDrinks:\nHell's Kitchen Antioxidant and Strawberry Martini - delicious\n\nAppetizers:\nFoie Gras - Out of this world!!!!!!\nChorizo Stuffed Lobster - Really good, but the foie gras was better.\n\nSides:\nMac and Cheese - Best I've ever had. That man loves his truffles.\n\nEntrees:\nPorterhouse For Two - Huge, tender, rich, delicious.\nBeef Wellington - Shocked and amazed that it tasted better than it looks on tv...and it looks pretty damn spectacular.\nBone-In Rib Eye - (my entree) Melt-in-your-mouth steak that I could've literally cut with a butter knife. The flavors were perfect and savory with a fantastic glaze over the entire steak.\n\nAll steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection!!\n\nUnfortunately, there was no complimentary dessert for birthdays. But if we're speaking honestly, I don't think I could've cared less. After the most incredible meal I've ever had accompanied with impeccable service, there isn't a whole lot that I could complain about. I cannot stop thinking about when I can go back!! I cannot emphasize enough how worth the money it is. Truly amazing."

Excellent but EXPENSIVE place, we had a $100 dining credit so it wasn't quite a big of a hit but otherwise this place will eat up some serious cash. Service was very friendly but they were a bit too pushy IMO in trying to sell dessert, I'm sure it was tasty but I was just too full. \n\nThe food is top notch as you'd expect for this price. They start you off with some of the tastiest bread I've had at any restaurant. One is lemon herb bread that isn't cornbread but looks a bit like it, one is a cinnamon roll type bread, and one is a crispy baguette slice, try them all plain and with some of the butter. The French Onion Soup is interesting here, it's thicker than most places and it really rich. It almost has the consistency of gravy rather than soup which I enjoyed but I could see it being too think for some people. We had fingerling potatoes (might've been the best potatoes I've ever had) and shitake mushrooms (enjoyable as well with a ginger taste) as sides. As for the main course, I had the 18oz New York Strip. This was a huge steak with not too much fat and cooked perfectly medium well, I wasn't able to finish this but gave it my absolute best shot.\n\nThere were a couple of minor odd things here, they show you the drink menu on an iPad which is kinda interesting but they only give you one so you have to pass it around. It's a cool gimmick but I think a regular menu would be easier. Do try a drink though, the Drifter is an expensive but tasty bourbon drink. Be sure and also specify tap water unless you want to pay for your H20, your choice but be warned. One last weird thing that may only matter to me is the steak knife handle was oddly uncomfortable when I was slicing up my massive slab of meat. Never had that happen before it somehow was a little annoying.\n\nThis place is expensive so I wouldn't come too often. I really enjoyed my meal and it was worth the try, especially with a dining credit. I was skeptical given it's one of those \"celebrity chef\" places but Gordon I've gotta say you know steak."

None were worth what we then appreciated to be an exorbitant cost.  Tough, fatty, not much flavor.  When I pay $60+ for a steak I want it to be memorable.  I did not even eat all of mine, not because of size, but because I became bored.\n\nAll in all a very disappointing restaurant.  Mr. Ramsay needs to yell at himself for awhile."

The short review is that the food was great, but the service was not very good. We had a 7:30 reservation and showed up at 7:25. We were not seated until 8:20 with no apology or any sort of acknowledgement of our wait. Parties of two came and went while my party of four waited and waited. Once seated we were promptly greeted and drink orders were taken. The drinks took another lifetime to arrive. We were able to order the food, but the apps did not arrive for another 40 minutes. The apps were fine, but we were just hungry at that time. The meat took even longer to arrive, but was served beautifully. I had the Royal Chop which was full of flavor and I did not hesitate to pick up the bone and find the last bits of meat. The sides were well prepared and complemented the meal quite well. The desserts were quite good. I don't typically care for toffee, but the dessert is as advertised. We didn't leave the restaurant until about 11:00 for a 7:30 reservation and it wasn't because we were taking our sweet time. I would certainly come back for the food, but I was left very disappointed with the service and time it took. Yes, it was a Saturday night, but the restaurant was never full at any point."

I had the heirloom tomato salad, 8oz American Kobe filet, fingerling potatoes, and of course I saved room for chocolate cake.  It was amazing and it has changed how I look at food.  It has elevated my palate. \n\nMy only note is that the music was a bit loud, and a bit more like nightclub music than I prefer, but I really didn't care, I was in heaven.  \n\nChristina Wilson, Head Chef and winner of Hell's Kitchen was there and she was gracious enough to pause from a very busy dinner service to take a picture and to say hello to us an few other fans.

Considering I was lucky enough to try both Pub & Grill and Burgr, Chef Ramsay has set quite the expectation and fulfilled it accordingly. Steak averages around 100 per person so my birthday was the perfect occasion to finally check it out. \nYou enter through a tunnel, and the hostess explains you are now entering the tunnel which takes you from Las Vegas to London. Once you step inside the restaurant you can understand the transformation as it no longer looks or smells like you are in a Las Vegas casino. \nYou are drawn to the beautiful red artwork in the center ceiling of the room. They then explain that is a replica of Chef Ramsay's hand movements while he is making his classic Beef Wellington. For the record, I am pretty much in AWWW at this point. Mouth dropped and all!\nWe are the escorted upstairs to a private dining room. Awesome, quiet, and romantic. But I kind of actually enjoy looking at the open kitchen, and the cool red hanging hand art. \nOverall, we were there between 2 and 3 hours. It was quite the dinner extravaganza. From the cheeseburger olive in my martini. To the display of steak cuts brought to your table. To the bread basket and it being some of the best bread ever. Truly, start to finish I was impressed. \nI personally had the 24oz bone in ribeye. I tried Shawn H.'s foie gras (something I previously hated yet enjoyed here) Shared some truffled fingerling potatoes, asparagus, mac and cheese, carrots with chicken skins, and the best beat salad I have ever had. \nI could go on and on about all the food but until you experience yourself, there are no words. Worth the price, worth waiting for. Just do it. You will thank me."

Not just with the diners pleasure in mind, but also in the purse of the restaurant owner.  We're both losers.  Blue Moon, Pacifico, and Newcastle for drafts? Yikes. Why do I want a top notch craft aged/butchered steak, paired with bargain basement produced for the masses beer?  Epic failure.\n\nThe restaurant was busy, and actually admiditaly got caught off guard by a very large party.  There was an exceptional wait for the dinner that I had ordered.  They did however keep me well lubricated.  They ended up comping me for 2 glasses of wine.  $28 each.  Very nice gesture.\n\nCaesar salad. Disassembled full length leaves of romaine. Oddly they looked completely un-dressed, but somehow they were.  Even though taste was good, major failure in that I had to cut my salad with a knife.  I am ok with that if it's a wedge salad, as it is quite manageable.  Loose full length leaves of romaine aren't quite as agreeable.  Especially after a pre-order cocktail, and a couple of glasses of wine.\n\nBig standout from the bread tray - fig/bacon mini cinnamon roll looking thing. Amazing.\n\nSteak was everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  Cooked and presented to perfection.  Absolutely delicious."

Just make sure you have a reservation or else good luck getting seated...\n\nFilet mignon and New York strips are excellent, as is the Kobe. The ribeye, on the other hand, was just okay-- I expected better given the glazing and dry aging they claim to do.\n\nMuch like the ribeye, the seafood platter was also just okay. They actually had excellent clams, shrimp, and lobster, but the oysters were a serious letdown. The rest of the meal made up for it, though, with a delicious scotch egg, a solid baked potato, and a ridiculously good haricot vert (tempura-battered green beans). Gnocchi was also a hit.\n\nReal reason for this rating? We had perhaps the slowest meal in the whole restaurant. The tables surrounding us, we saw some had changed over twice in the time we were there, I think one might've changed over three times. The wait between courses was excruciating until the main courses all came out at once. The scotch egg? The seafood platter? I think they were birthing the chickens one by one in the back, and the seafood must've still be on the way from the airport when we ordered.\n\nWaiting for dessert (the toffee thing was awesome) wasn't too bad, but it was definitely more waiting..."

I'm not sure if these are supposed to be family style. They are only $13 I think, but come in small cups. It wasnt really a problem because we are not glutinous pigs. A couple spoonfuls were sufficient for each of the 4 of us. The bread plate was nice. After Joel Robuchon bread cart, it was not about to blow me away, but since we didn't pay $445, I could understand. We got a magnum of Hirsch Pinot for 295, which was good to the last drop.

It was great. I mean GREAT; so many delicate flavors and textures going on.  Sublime. Ditto the sauteed mushrooms and mac-and-cheese sides.  And, for dessert, we went with the other \"signature,\" the sticky toffee pudding.  To die for.\n\nThe bill was pretty hefty, but, for a meal that good, I can't feel as though I overpaid.

I can tell you that this place has the best beef wellington on the planet.  Why the 4 stars over a 5 star then?\nWe arrived to the Paris hotel on 6/8/13 after my wedding for what I wanted to be the most magical ending to our night.  I had a reservation for 9pm and after all the great reviews I assumed we would be sat right at 9pm.  Wrong!  we were told by the very skinny hostess to wait in the lounge until our table was ready.  We figured okay it won't be that long and we can get a look at the menu while we are in there.  10 minutes goes by and we now know what we want but still no drink service.  After the 10 minute mark the waitress arrives to take drink orders.  I ask for the Inis and Gunn Stout (Gordon's favorite beer from Scotland) and I ask if it is a draft or bottled beer.  She looks at me as if she had never heard of such a beer which was quite shocking since the girl gets an average $50-$100 tip per check probably and should know the drink menu forward and backward.  Especially working in the lounge!  She had to ask the bartender what that was and she came back and told me it was a draft.  Whew problem diverted!  After another 10 minutes of waiting I went back outside and asked the hostess what we need to do to get sat and she said they would come in and get us.  I go back inside but now I don't even want a beverage and I feel like my wedding night is going to end on a sour note.  I see the hostess walking around the lounge holding a piece of paper in the air looking for the next guests to be sat.  Seemed pretty tacky!  I had asked the hostess how long it was going to be and she said that our table needed to be cleaned and the people there needed to get up.  Well thank God they did after 30 minutes of waiting and we were finally greeted by the hostess to be sat.  They were so oblivious to our 30 minute wait and went right into their rehearsed \"We now take your from Paris to London\" bit which made us all laugh at how corny and fake it was.  \nFinally sat upstairs my best man notices that his seat has been totally worn out like someone had taken sandpaper to it and took all the fabric off.  It looked like a seat you might see at an old diner on route 66 or something.  Our server arrived and she was as nice as they come and so was our busser who was from Africa. He brought us so much water and bread that was out of this world.  We got a bottle of wine which was delivered in a very classy way by another super friendly gentleman and I got the Inis and Gunn Stout and couldn't be happier.  We knew what we all wanted so 3 of us got the Beef Wellingtons and the my wife got the 8oz. American Kobe Filet.  The other girls got salmon and a seafood sampler.  We decided to get 6 sides which were more than enough and we tested everything from mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes, cream of spinach and so on.  All of it was out of this world good, but the entrees were near perfection in every way.  You could cut our meats with a fork it was that tender.  When it was all said and done we didn't have any room for the famous sticky toffee pudding so take note that even though the items are a la carte it doesn't mean you need to over indulge.  \nIf it wasn't for the second half of our night and the African gentleman whose name I didn't get, the wine manager, and our waitress Jonel (name?) it would have been a lost everning and one I would love to forget.  I so badly wanted to give this place a 5 star and hopefully the front of the house issues will be resolved very soon."

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I think it sat in the window for a little bit as the little helping I had of potato puree and the so-called demi glaze were almost dried out on the plate. Prior to ordering I had asked the server if I should order a sauce on the side for the wellington. He suggested that I eat it as is. Well I should have ordered a sauce. In my opinion, it was just boring. I was also expecting the meat to be super tender, but i did have to work at slicing it. Of course, that could have to do with the medium-rare preparation. \n\nEverything else I had was excellent. There was one piece of bread that had nuts and bleu cheese. Very good! The onion soup was excellent. I liked the thickness and the addition of the cheese covered pieces of bread. For sides I had the street corn and mac & cheese. Those tasted great.

At one point, I was even personally escorted all the way to the restroom when I asked where the restroom was.  Before we selected our meal, our waiter not only explained the specials of the day... but also brought over a \"Ferris Wheel\" of meats (which is a tray of different steak cuts for viewing / educational purposes).  The overall service here is impeccable and I wouldn't expect anything less from a Gordon Ramsey establishment.\n\nThe restaurant ambience and atmosphere here are exactly what I look for.  It's sexy, yet playful.  It maintains a sense of intimacy, yet is still high-energy.  The decor is modern glamorous and trendy.  It's not a bad looking crowd either.\n\nTo start, the bread basket at GR is one of the best I've experienced.  Truffle and mushroom rolls, bacon and fig rolls, etc.  My friend got the Kabuto pork chops which were perfectly done.  I had a bite of his and it quickly because one of my favorites.\n\nAs for my meal, I had the baked potato and bone-in rib-eye.  Both were good but very rich and fatty.  After a while I got tired of the richness and fattiness of both.  Surprisingly I didn't finish both items which is a rarity in my book.  I'm certain my eating experience would be much different if I ordered a filet or a steak that is leaner.  Anyhow, consider this review a 4.5.  I'll be back again in the future to try to something else on the menu."

            "review": "My wife and I are very happy guests.\n\nWe went to Ramsay Steak a couple days before Christmas.  Were able to obtain a reservation on a Friday night and from there everything started getting even better.  \n\nWe asked several high end restaurants if there was a Chef's Table available.  The answer was generally no.  We then made a standard reservation at Ramsay's and then called a couple hours before and asked for the tables facing he kitchen.  We were fortunate to get chef's table that  Gordon sits at with his family when in town.\n\nService was awesome.  Getian was our server and he was personable, attentive,  and thorough.  Sommelier was very helpful and even though our fist choice was out of stock, the back up was probably the better selection at the same price.\n\nDinner - I had the Foie gras appetizer.  Perfectly cooked on a bed of pistachios that made it great,  Two popovers filled with goat cheese.  Nice presentation.  My wife had the green and white asparagus soup over crab.  Presentation was gorgeous.  Super rich.  Almost too much in front of a full steak dinner but that is not a knock on the food, just heavy.  \n\nWe had American Wagyu filet and end cap.  Perfectly cooked.  Flavorful.  Added Brussels Sprouts and fingerling potatoes.  More food than we could eat but we did it on purpose so we could taste a wide variety.  Finally we added King Crab legs to dinner.  This is the one thing I would leave off.  They were just OK.  A bit salty.  Really too much with everything else we had but what the heck, It was Christmas.\n\nWe could not eat another bite but were told before hand not to leave without the sticky toffee pudding.  Holy $hit.  Seriously one of the top ten tastes that I have had.  Light, sweet but not too sweet.  Ice cream was to die for.  Just ridiculously good.   Do not leave without it.\n\nThis was not cheap.  We knew that going in. The total experience - service, food, creativity, presentation, chef's table...  It made it very much worth it.\n\nThank you for having us."

We are big fans of Master Chef show so attending to the restaurant was a must in our list. Bucket list! After reading some reviews online about Beef wellington I was still undecided about what to order. Filet Mignon or Beef Wellington. As soon as we enter the restaurant, I said to myself I need to order the Beef wellington and after a couple of steaks cuts demonstrations and talking to the waitress we both decide to order the Beef Wellington. My bf order the Cesar salad which was delicious. I ordered the clams which were ok I guess. The breads were very interesting. They have very different flavors. We had two orders :) The HK signature cocktail was good as well. And then the Bee Wellington. Perfect! Delicious! I never try it before and Im glad I did. The filet was perfect. We ordered a side of some potatoes but we shouldn't have. The wellington was more than enough. No need of a side. At the end of the entrees, we were ridiculously full. The waitress told us that we need to try the dessert. And I was like \"I cant\" but the way he describe it and his continuously effort led me to order the Sticky toffee pudding! OMG the second best food of the night. Is something I cant even describe. My mouth was going crazy. Its huge and delicious. We took the rest to go and ended up eating it like 2 days after and it was still amazing. Food comma for sure but an amazing one. Bucket list checked."

For dinner we ordered a steak and Gordon's infamous Beef Wellington. Wow, wow, wow. The Wellington was mouth watering, meat was cooked perfect, the crust was flakey, buttery and soft. It was perfection in my mouth. Now, they warn you it takes a little longer to wait if you order the Wellington. That was fine by me but they must have fired my girlfriends steak a little early because it came out lukewarm. We notified our server, he simply through her steak back on the grill to reheat it!? So now her medium steak came out well done. As per my girlfriends orders I could not further complain. In my opinion she should have received a new steak. For the cold steak they did offer us dessert, which we graciously accepted. For dessert we ordered the toffee cake. YOU MUST ORDER THE TOFFEE DESSERT! Hands down best dessert I've ever had in my life. But I was still unhappy the steak was just thrown back on an reheated. That is the only reason GRS gets 3 stars. Had that been handled differently I would give a 4-5!"

Not much I can say about this that hasn't already been said. It was my first time having a wellington of any sort, so I was worried it would come dry (how they cook the meat and the pastry perfectly together is beyond my realm of understanding), but my concerns quickly melted away with each wonderful bite. You're warned that it takes 45 minutes to come out, but I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes. \n+ Kobe Rib Cap: Ohhhhhhhh wow. I had no idea what a rib cap was until the server explained it. Imagine a ribeye. You've got that massive chunk of meat, sometimes with a bone attached. On the perimeter opposite of the bone, you've got the rib cap in all its buttery, tender glory. Loved this!! The server recommended the bone marrow sauce to go along with it. Honestly, it would've been perfectly fine on its own, but the sauce was delicious and decadent addition to every bite. \n\nThe Brussel sprouts and Mushrooms we got to accompany the meal were good, but got too salty to finish at the end. \n\nI'm always a little worried about celebrity restaurants because I can certainly see the quality of food deteriorating over time simply since their name has gotten so big and less attention is paid to the food. Thankfully, that's not the case with Gordon Ramsay Steak!"

Service was excellent and above all, the food was amazing!  They also have a great wine and bottle selection, in all price ranges.\n\nThe comp bread selection :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#Y31dBHh-ymp7NBmYSQbyDQ\n\nThe bread platter had a good variety! My favorite was probably the bacon bread...for good reason!\n\nThe dinner company wasn't craving red meat, so she went with the fish and chips.  It was unbelievably good....more like gourmet fish fillet with a slight breading and an  outstanding taste.  Yum\n\nI went with the ribeye...it was 24oz of 30 days dry aged beef.  :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA\n\nI could throw out a nice number of adjectives at you, and tell you cliche things, like how it melts in your mouth, but the truth tells itself :\n\nI ate the ENTIRE thing...AND almost every piece of fat that was on this thing.  The FAT was so tender on this ribeye, that it truly melted in your mouth, and gave the rest of the steak a super intense flavor when combined.  I seriously couldn't help myself...it was like a drug.  I was so stuffed, but I kept eating so that I could really savor each bite.  That \"close your eyes, that was the best piece of cow I have ever consumed\" feel.\n\nThe sides :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#_JKeY5Vn87VtB_SOasPPCQ\n\nMac & Cheese : blue, cheddar, parmesan, and truffle. Fingerling Potatoes : parmesan and truffle. The mac and cheese here is great, but the fingerling potatoes blew my mind! There was so much truffle flavor hiding in between the potatoes....Probably the best way I've consumed potatoes and truffles to date LOL!\n\nFor dessert, I have no idea how I fit it in...but we went with the toffee pudding or whatever it was called...excellent.  Not sure why this was so good, but it was one of my favorite desserts I have had to date....it just works.\n\nI will be back!

Sorry Mario, I like Gordon's food better than Carnevino.  \n\nI've been there just once, but I was so impressed by the food that I wanted to go again to taste more of the menu.  When I went to make a reservation, they were all booked solid for a week.  Make your reservation well in advance if you plan on going, especially on a weekend.\n\nThere are some annoyances - the prices on the appetizers are horrendous and sometimes don't deliver.  I had the fried oysters for about $18 and I got three - yes, three oysters.  But they were plated more beautiful than I have ever seen.  And my other big annoyance - the completely useless ipad drink list.  But the food was so good I am giving a pass on this.\n\nSome of you may have seen that show Meat Men on Food Network - that's the guy supplying the beef, and it is incredible.  It has a distinct flavor  I have not experienced before - and want to again.  The ribeye for two - while not as big as the ribeye for two from Carnevino, actually feeds two very well for less than $100, as opposed to the mammoth $150ish you pay with Mario Batali's.\n\nSo if you've been on the fence about trying Gordon's establishment - don't be.  Just go, when you can get a reservation."

If Gordon Ramsay Steak is anything to measure him by though, then I'd say he lives up to his famous reputation.\n\nThe service was attentive and professional. I ordered the flank steak medium rare (chef recommendation for doneness). It was perfectly seasoned and incredibly tender. Got the creamed corn side - delicious and perfectly seasoned as well. Just enough spice kick that it didn't overpower the other flavours. The side was so good I almost ordered it twice - the flavour was really on point. \n\nDuring the meal the glass I was sipping wine out of cracked around the rim (didn't shatter or splinter, just a hairline crack). The staff immediately removed it and replaced it with a new glass, with a full re-pour. This is of course expected, but I appreciated their urgency in resolving the issue right away.\n\nInstead of the famous sticky toffee pudding for desert, I went with the sorbet trio. Nothing mindblowing but it was tasty.\n\nOn TV Gordon Ramsay is usually giving his chefs hell for poorly seasoning and undercooking food on Hell's Kitchen / Kitchen Nightmares / MasterChef / etc. I'm betting he is vigorous in holding his restaurant staff to these standards as well, because my meal was seasoned and cooked perfectly."

We also ordered some sides like mushrooms, spinach, Mac and cheese. Nothing was that memorable besides the Foie gras. \n\nHOWEVER overall, it was salty. Every single dish. If they eased up on the salt, I may have enjoyed it more because the meat was definitely a good cut. But I've had better for that price range. My favorite is still Maestros steakhouse.

I even saved this review to be my 100th Yelp review!\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying I love fine dining.  I enjoy the experience and have been doing so all my life.  So on my most recent trip to Las Vegas of course had to try it.  I was devastated when we couldn't get a reservation.  So my first tip... Make a reservation, EARLY!  Plan ahead and make sure you have a table.  We arrived right when they opened so we grabbed a table in the bar area.  Luckily they still serve the full menu in the bar seating area.  \n\nWhile I was tempted to try the wellington due to Ramsay's TV shows, the rib cap came highly recommended.  The flavor was beyond amazing.  Below are the dishes we had.  Absolutely every single item I am listing here I am highly recommending!!\n\nBeet salad appetizer : I don't know what they do to these beets, but the way they paired so deliciously with the goat cheese and creme fraiche.  My husband which doesn't like beets even liked this!\n\nHamachi Crudo : the black garlic puree that the fish is served on is delicious.\n\nAmerican Wagyu Rib Cap : The marbling and flavor of this cut is like no other.  I had never had this particular cut of meat before and let me tell you, whenever I see it I will order it.  We were told that all the meats are aged there on site.  So cool!\n\nMac & Cheese Side Dish : two words... savory & heavenly\n\n...and finally for dessert the sticky toffee pudding.  I'm english and have eaten sticky toffee pudding for christmas every year since I was a young girl.  This was by far the best I've ever had!  Just the right about of richness, the cream wasn't too heavy and since it is such a rich dish, the size of the dessert was just perfect.\n\nExpect to pay for such amazing cuisine.  But I promise you will not be disappointed.  I thought that Gordon Ramsay was all hype due to all the TV shows, but damn, he really has earned every bit of his fame!"

Each person at my table tried a different steak and I had the wellington.  We all loved my wellington.  The only thing I don't like that I have to fly back to Vegas to get it.  Honestly I would never try this anywhere else.  It was more than I hoped for.  Rich, tender, buttery, succulent. Don't bother ordering sides with it.  They lay it on a potato puree that is perfect.  There were a few baked potatoes at my table and they are huge... as in I have never seen potatoes so huge.  I have no idea what sauce they put on the potatoes but OMG what I tasted was good.  Service was great and they offer a good explanation of the meats and show them to you before ordering.  The water was even better here.  You can dress casual here I would think but step it up a bit at night.  We had 10:15 reservations and planned on going out after so we dressed it up. We saw people ordering desserts but none at our table.  Maybe next time."

            "review": "Ok, let me start by saying the experience was wonderful. The ambience was sizzling. The staff friendly and knowledgable. The presentation of their steaks very impressive. The prices are moderate to high end. The food for the most part excellent.\nHowever I will start with my Premium 24oz Bone In Rib Eye. I requested the steak cooked to a medium. That being said at a glance it looked beautiful. Then as I started eating the outer edge of the steak it was perfect. When I started to get towards the center the rarer it got. By the time it got to the the bloodier it got. At the bone I expected the cow to lick me, seriously. There it was blue rare. The problem is at the restaurant I couldn't finish it all so I took it home at the medium rare point described above. I did not discover the rareness until after I went home the next day. I even reheated the steak up in our oven at work for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and still it came out rare at the bone. I was extremely disappointed by the results Friday m such a high end place. \nNext I will say that my guest had the American cut Filet Mignon. With similar results. Hers was not quite so rare, probably because of no bone being attached. The other two guests had a perfectly cooked entire, one the Beef Wellington, the other the Rib Cap.\nSo again, I post this to enlighten Chef Ramsey's Charge so that they can  correct the issue they appear to have. Granted they could have just had an off day. \nGood luck, and God Bless America"

The foie gras was great, the kobe steak was very tender but slightly overcooked, the king crab tasted fresh and doesn't seem like it was ever frozen.  The only disappointment was the long bone steak for 2 which had a ton of fat on the meat and I had to cut off much of the fat to get to the meat which was already sliced by the kitchen.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the meal after trying some of the other Vegas celebrity chef restaurants."

Even many in Vegas and this was  by far THE worst dining experience i have had in restaurants of this price point. They took us upstairs to a dingy dated room. It took forever to get our drinks. The presentation of the steaks was impressive but the execution of the experience was below poor. But then after 30 minutes of waiting for service anything would be impressive. The salad was wilted and presented like we were at a low end chain. Service was sloppy, food was marginal, staff seem bored. If this was the last steak house in Vegas I would eat chicken or fish somewhere else. Such a disappointment. I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay but I truly wonder if Gordon Ramsay has any idea his name is being tarnished like this. Stay away...its expensive and not worth it."

My only problem is they have put a hold on our credit card for $412.09 even though we already paid the bill and 5 days later the hold is still there. We have been calling for a long time now (from Canada so calls aren't cheap) and apparently they are too busy and can't come to the phone. I understand that they can be busy, but  we aren't calling to say hi, we are calling to find out why there is a hold on our credit card. It is a very expensive place ($476.73 just for two of us) and as a guest we should be treated with respect even if we aren't there."

(we were 10 mins early) That was a plus. we were seated upstairs in a sectioned off room which was nice beacause the restuarant was a bit noisy. I wish I remembered the waiters name because he was simply amazing. For apps I had the lobster with chorizo sauce. Fuck me that was tasty. Best thing I've ever eaten. For my main coarse i had predetermined that i would get the Wellington for obvious reasons, but when I saw the \"Kobe\" rib cap I knew I had to get it. I prefer ribeye to tenderloin because of flavor but the rib cap is as tender and tenderloin so had to switch it up. Smart decision on my part. That was the best steak I've eaten in a long time. The side were good. I had the mac which was good. Tasted the brussel sprouts and they were good as well, but the fingerling potatoes stole the show as far as side went. Overall the place was great, the service 5 star, and a great time. My only complaint is something all fine restuarants do and that is label meat as \"Kobe\" because its not. If you know why then you understand my frustration. i will say that when I probed the waiter about \"Kobe\" he said all the right things and explained it the right way which surprised me. again 5 star service."

            "review": "Just a heads up, this review is not meant to come of snobby by any means.  I am not a food critic, but I've definitely been to a lot of steakhouses and I can say this is the worst one I have been too.\n\nFirst, I am not the type of person who gets hyped for main-stream celebrities so when I heard this place was opening up I rolled my eyes.  However when my friend came to town a big fan of all his shows I figured we'd go since I did hear some pretty good reviews.\n\nFirst and foremost making a reservation was a pain, I called a month in advance and they said the only times they had were 5:00 and 9:30.  I'm sorry, i know popular places fill up fast, but people are not that on top of reservations in November to plan ahead.  Finally after personally visiting the hostess stand 2-weeks prior, I was able to get it bumped to 6PM.  it looks like finally the place is on Opentable so maybe that will solve that problem.\n\nUpon arrival, the eye rolling began.  As we walked into the restaurant the hostess said \"This tunnel you are walking through transports you from Paris to London\".  Next we admired what I would describe as  a tangled neon sign in the sky as the hostess explained \"This art represents the hand motions Chef Ramsey makes while preparing his signature beef wellington\".  We were than seated maybe 4 feet apart from another table, I saw this consistency across the dining floor and it began to occur to me this was more like a \"turn and burn\" cafe than fine intimate dining.\n\nThe waiter asked if we preferred sparkling or still water, when I said \"still\" he said nothing else and later brought a bottle of water to the table.  I assumed the red bottle was a decorative carafe, however I found out later on the check that it was an $8 of water.  I believe most places ask the follow-up after the water type with \"Tap or Bottled\" but this was not the case. \n\nOne tacky thing I noticed on the menu is that each item lists two prices, the normal price and the \"Total Rewards\" price.  I think the difference was about a buck and item, so I'm not sure why they didn't just put something at the bottom saying \"Total Rewards members receive X% off\" but they didn't and it makes the menu look unprofessional. \n\nSome people may like this, but I thought it was a little pointless when they wheeled the all the cuts of meat out and went through what each one was.  I can see where this is great for beginners, but I don't think it fits a fine dining setting.  That being said it looked like many of the patrons thought it was acceptable to wear a baseball hat and jeans into the restaurant.  I'm not saying you always have to \"suit up\" but it's not like you're going to McDonalds on your lunch break.\n\nMy friend and I decided on splitting the porterhouse steak.  I'll admit that several of the pieces I had were good, but I had about 3 pieces which were either really burnt and crunchy or a ton of fat.  The size also seemed like a rip-off, at $100 \"for two\" there really wasn't a lot, in fact I think the $50 Porterhouse at most places is bigger.\n\nFor a side we got the $10 heirloom potatoes.  I'm not going to put much weight into knocking the size, as it's tiny at any fancy place you go.\n\nMaybe I went wrong and got the wrong steak and instead should have ordered the beef wellington.  Maybe my preconceived notions of it being a celebrity TV chef and all the touristy things the hostess explains put me in a bad mindset.  But overall I have no want to ever come back here again."

Don't get me wrong the food was amazing but it just didn't live up to the hype.\n\nThe only reason why I'm not rating it 3 stars is because of the amazing waitress we had that night. She was sincere with her suggestions, witty and just an absolute doll the whole night. She really made the dinner experience great. With that said, now the reason why I would have given it 3 stars.\n\nThe beef Wellington was talked up by many reviews and it was in my sights before I arrived. While I was there I asked many questions about the dish and received a luke warm response. Once the meat tray, yes the meat tray came out with raw cuts of beef for you to choose, modeled by a Vanna White like waitress, I bailed on the Beef Wellington. \n\nI instead opted for the American Rib Cap that was simply one of the most tender cuts of beef I have tried. It wasn't over powered by seasoning allowing the true taste of the cut to come through. Like any respectable red blooded meat lover should order their steak, I of course went medium rare. This cut can be compared to a skirt/flank steak, just a high end version of it. This is where I run into a problem, sure it's a great cut of beef but that's it. It's not something I would expect from chef \"Ramsey the Great\" in all his glory.  His name may be on the restaurant but he's not cooking the meal. \n\nYou might be thinking I may be harsh but that is hardly the case my dear sir or madam. I have eaten at the Pub by Ramsey which was ehhh. Also near by Burgr which is hands down UH-Mazing!!! I am an avid foodie especially in Vegas eating on and off the strip. Dives and high end swanky places as well. That is why I can say objectively I was not impressed. \n\nI also had three sides. Mac & Cheese, Fingerling Potatoes and Bourbon Cream Corn. The corn hands down was the best out of the three. It even out shined the steak. Yea I said it and what?! \n\nFinally, I finished my meal with what I have to describe as a life altering experience... Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The moistness throughout the cake, the presentation, THA sauce... Tha Sauce... It was perfection through every single bite. It simply just melted in your mouth and made me forget in that moment that I most likely wouldn't dine here again. \n\nWas the food bad? No, it was great! Was it over priced? Absolutely without a doubt for the quality I received.  You may be thinking I'm your everyday cheapo but think again. I have spent much more for a meal than I did at \"Steak\" but it was worth every penny. Here I simply was cheated out of my money as many are in the casinos. \n\nBy the way, our dinner party split the Beef Wellington and it wasn't even edible. It was an over-priced and poorly made empanada (Latin American stuff pastry).  Granted I was warned about it but I couldn't shake the curiosity. In my case, curiosity killed this cat... If you are looking for an amazing steak, check out my other reviews. \n\nMy concluding thoughts. If an establishment has a celebrity name attached to it, it doesn't guarantee an amazing meal.  Remember sometimes it's all smoke and mirrors what we see on TV."

The first time, they said it was normal, but as she got closer to the center, it was literally rare and cool. Kinda killed that part of dinner as she waited for it to get cooked longer.

NOT A CUSTOMER FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE, nor a restaurant I would ever visit again.\n\nA group of us were looking forward to trying Gordon Ramsay's restaurant Stake for the first time on a recent visit to Las Vegas, we were very disappointed with what occurred. When we arrived in the not so busy restaurant we were sat at the bar for 5 min. before we were ushered to our table.  \n\nOnce seated our waitress arrived with menus and a special VERY MUCH RECOMENDED tasting menu.  We discussed it and decided to try the tasting menu and wine pairing a $175 pp option not including tax or tip.  When we told the waitress that I do not eat beef (there was one item on the tasting menu that contained beef) and asked if we could have the chef substitute a fish dish or some other non-beef dish she flatly told us no.  We asked what if other four had the tasting menu and I would order instead off the menu, again we were told NO.  We asked to see the manager, a young lady came to the table and again said there is nothing they can do about this, she confirmed  it is true as few as two can share the tasting menu but it is served only to the entire table or nothing.  Because of this lack of accommodation and customer service we got up and left and all agreed never to go to another of Gordon Ramsay's establishments. What ever happened to the customer is always right?  This was a very disappointing experience and certainly a very customer unfriendly place. In this day and age it is amazing to find such a lack of customer concern, not to mention the $1000 meal they turned down, guess it is great to be independent and not need or care about business lost. I have but one word for the entire experience, Arrogant."

I still have dreams about the food, no lie.  \n\nWe had reservations for 4 on our last night in Vegas, and thank goodness we waited until then because Gordon Ramsay Steak blew away every other meal we had while were were there.  We were seated promptly upon arrival.  The restaurant is pretty trendy and loud inside, and the decor seriously reminded me of a trumped-up Hell's Kitchen.  We started off with a round of their specialty drinks which you order on an iPad (weird and cool!)... I had the English Garden and my husband had the Sidecar, both of which were delicious and perfectly balanced.  \n\nFor appetizers, we started with the Caesar salad (which interestingly was served with a scotch egg... yum!) and the Onion soup.  My husband loooooooved onion soup and he said it was quite possibly the best he's ever had.  For our entree, I shared the Beef Wellington for 2 with my friend (don't worry, it comes out on 2 separate plates portioned so you don't have to fight over the meat with your dining partner).  This is their signature dish and it lived up to the hype.  The meat was a perfect medium rare and literally melted in my mouth.  The crust was buttery and crispy and complemented the meat well.  My husband had the Rib Cap steak, which neither of us had heard of... well, it was out of the park delicious as well, and I think it may be his new favorite cut of meat.  We also split the parmesan and truffle roasted potatoes and the tempura fried haircots vert.  Both were wonderful.  All four of us literally cleaned the plates it was so good.\n\nAnd then DESSERT!  I had the french press coffee, because for $8, I needed to know what was so special about it.  Well... it comes with 3 chocolate spoons with different liquors to stir into your coffee!  I enjoyed that thoroughly, especially when I complained to the waiter that the men ate my other 2 spoons and he brought us 3 more :)  We split 2 desserts among us- an apple thing that was good but drastically overshadowed by the sticky toffee cake... served with a caramel sauce and brown butter ice cream.  The 4 of us basically fought over that plate.  I would have a hard time ordering any other dessert, because it was that good.\n\nThis meal was pricey but worth every penny.  Gordon Ramsay Steak is now on my must-go list in Las Vegas."

            "review": "We all know Gordon Ramsey. The ill tempered celebrity chef from England made a name for himself. When I think of him, he isn't smiling or laughing. I think of angry eyes, wrinkles on the forehead, and fire coming out of his mouth. That imagery to me, is more laughable than scary. But truly, Gordon Ramsey did make a name for himself, literally. The guy names his restaurants after his name. Gordon Ramsey at The London, and this blog post, Gordon Ramsey Steak at Paris. You must be pretty full of yourself if you name your restaurants after your first name. If Gordon Ramsey has the audacity to put him name (again, literally) on his restaurants, he must be pretty confident in it. With that kind of thinking, I expect top notch flavors and cuisine.\n\nRamsey's vision to transport you to the U.K. is accomplished through the \"English Channel.\" This is exactly what it does. You are transformed from Paris to the UK, just like the real thing! The inside really does transport you to England. The red accents and obviously, the U.K. flag gave it that ambiance.\n\nAnother thing that was cool was the beverage selection. The menu is on an iPad and guests can swipe through craft beers, wines, and cocktails. The price and drink description are all available. This was an experience in itself, which probably pushed me to order the Primm's Cup.\n\nThe night started with a cocktail. The Primm's Cup was the cocktail of choice. It had Primm's No. 1 and sparkling lemonade. It had a complex flavor and wasn't too sweet. It was spicy and had a fruity citric flavor. I wanted something with a little bite so that it went well with a steak. The Primm's Cup wouldn't be my first choice if it was enjoyed alone. For a meal though, I think this was a successful choice.\n\nWe were given complimentary bread. This was a good start -- it was some of the best and most flavorful of restaurant complimentary breads. There was walnut bread; lemon, thyme, and olive focacia; and pancetta and mushroom truffle bread roll. This was accompanied with and English Devonshire butter with sea salt. If not the bread, this butter was amazing. It had a cheese like consistency and flavor. My ultimate goal now was to find English Devonshire butter back in L.A. A \"shmeer\" of this stuff on the bread was purely exceptional. The pop of the sea salt and the creamy butter was purely eventful in my mouth. Sometimes, all a man needs is good butter and good bread. This was surely a great start.\n\nAnother item I wanted to start off with was the bone marrow. A personal favorite at any restaurant, I was happy to see it on the menu. The fatty bone marrow on the crostini was delightful. The chimichurri was zesty and added the acidity to the dish. It was a perfect flavor meld of fat and fat.\n\nThe waiter came to our table with a display of steaks. All of the steaks were real, and displayed to show texture, and marbling. This was nearly useless to me as I was going to order the beef Wellington, but useful to others not knowing what to order. Table side presentation of steaks, as Wolfgang Puck's CUT does it is an added wow factor. It is cool to see your steak as is before its cooked off.\n\nMy main dish of course, was the roasted Beef Wellington. Being Gordon Ramsey's signature dish, I was overly excited to try it. Seeing up and coming, \"red team, blue team\" contestants mess this up time and time again, it was almost like a super star. The beef was cooked perfectly to a medium rare, and soft as ever can be. The beefy flavor was enhanced by the duxelles (mixture of minced mushrooms, onions, shallots, herbs, and butter) inside the flaky crust. Sitting on aside some root vegetables, potato puree, and a red wine demi glace, the entire dish was savory to a great degree. Steakhouses are one of many in Vegas, and the typical bone in ribeye was getting boring. I am glad I ordered and tried the Beef Wellington. Surprisingly, I liked it. Beef Wellington form Gordon Ramsey can now be checked off from the bucket list.\n\nA perfect side dish was the mac and cheese. This may be one of my favorite mac and cheeses of all time! The combination of cheddar, blue cheese, parmesan, and truffle made this perfectly balanced taste. The cheese blend was unctuous and the noodles had a perfect texture. I normally prefer the southern style man and cheese -- the one that is custardy and cheddar molested. Gordon Ramsey Steak's mac and cheese impressed me a lot. I would take this over any other mac and cheese out there.\n\nAnother dish I couldn't pass up was the Maine lobster. The chorizo stuffed Maine lobster was poached in butter. To top it all off, it sat in a pool of brandied lobster cream sauce. The lobster was cooked perfectly and had a nice chew to it. The chorizo wasn't overpowering, and the lobster just shined. The rich butter and cream sauce was decadent and flavorful. I as expecting a small lobster piece of a tail, but it was quite large. Screw the steak! I'll just eat this for protein."

We were given some interesting details about decor as we were taken to our table. Unfortunately the table was in a dark corner on the first floor with a wall for my view. I politely asked if we could get another table and our request was granted without hesitation... a table at the bottom of the stairs with a perfect view of the action. Our waiter Alex was excellent... answering every question we had and not making us feel rushed. We ordered wine and the chorizo stuffed lobster tail for an app and it was outstanding! Next we ordered our entrees... the rib cap for me and the infamous beef wellington for my wife. The rib cap was amazing as well as the wellington... melts in your mouth. My wife and I got the asparagus and mac and cheese for sides respectively... and let me tell you it was the best mac and cheese Ive ever had! Then it gets better... dessert is sticky toffee pudding... omg... I have never tasted any dessert that can even come close to the synergy of flavors that Chef Ramsay gave me. All I can say is Chef Ramsay delivers on all levels... from the food... to the service... to the atmosphere... this is an experience that you will never forget!... ever!"

We ordered the famous beef Wellington, which would have been delicious, however the menu left out the fact that it contained a horseradish sauce, and I hate the taste of horseradish. It overwhelmed the entire flavor of the meal. Seems like a pretty aggressive flavor to just leave out of the description, poor form Gordon, poor form. Sides were just okay, nothing mind blowing. Service was great, as were the beverages.\n\nProbably won't go back...unless it's for the ribeye"

Ordered kurobuta double pork chop which was the most disappointing entre ever. It had NO flavor but a piece of meat in this big fancy plate. Even I could have seasoned it better than this!!! Asked for some sauce to go with it , not even the sauce was good just tasted like regular BBQ sauce. Roast beef Wellington was better but didn't have that wow factor for a signature dish.

We drove out to vegas knowing we were going to go to a Ramsay restaurant, after researching and looking on Yelp we decided to go to the steak house in the Paris resort.  As huge fans of his shows, we decided to get the Hell's Kitchen Menu.  This is my first time on Yelp and will say a few things.\n\nWe arrived at Ramsay Steak about 10 mins before our 8:30PM reservation, we go to the hostess and told they are running a little late...No problem, we will go to the bar and grab a drink or two.\n\nWaited about 15 mins, and some how the hostess knew who we were and took us to our table.  We got sparkling water and waited for the waiter to take our order....Now this is where shit got real:  I am from Washington D.C. and I found myself out of the element LOL\n\nThe bring out the bread, I didn't realize but I was cutting the butter with not a butter knife...felt like a dip shit but hey, not use to fine dinning.   Now to the Hells Kitchen menu:\n\nLet me first say that our waiter Charles N.  was the man!  He explained that we will be in for the meal of our lives,. and he was not joking.  From the first course \"Scottish egg\"  to the Beef Wellington to the Dessert, the wow factor was there!  From the first bite, to Andrew changing our cutlery to the drinks to the experience it was fucking AWESOME.  Charles N was the best waiter I have ever experienced and Andrew was his help, I have to say that this was not just fine dinning, it was a fine experience!  We asked if the Hells kitchen winner was available to maybe take a picture, but she was on a (I am sure well deserved) vacation.\n\n\nThank you Gordon Ramsay for that experience, Charles N. was a great server and his help Andrew made this experience great.  We paid almost $500 for two of us, and I would Happily pay that again for the same experience!"

The music is loud, the hemlines are short, and the food is fantastic.\n\nThe cocktail menu is full of hand-crafted libations.  Both the South Side and English Garden were fresh, well balanced and delicious.\n\nFor appetizers, the Fried Blue Point Oysters had a light tempura batter and came with sea asparagus and creme fresh tartar sauce.\n\nThe seared Foie Gras was perfection with hazel nuts, gooseberry reduction and goat cheese popovers.  If you like foie gras, this is a must order.\n\nFor entrees, the Beef Wellington's 28-day dry aged fillet mignon was so tender and lovingly wrapped in layers of flavor. \n\nThe bone-in dry aged Ribeye was again very tender, had a deep beefy flavor, and a charred crust from the intense searing.\n\nFor sides, the Brussels Sprouts were charred and had the perfect acidic tang, and the Bone Marrow was silky and had rich flavor especially at the charred ends of the bone.\n\nAnd save room for coffee and dessert!  The Cappuccino is delicious and comes with 3 cordial spoons (Amaretto, Baileys, and Chambord) and the sweet Sticky Toffee Pudding with Browned Butter Ice Cream is worth over stuffing yourself for!\n\nGordon Ramsey Steak is a great place to celebrate with friends when you're partying in style.

Which was great advice because many of the good buffets in Vegas had people in line waiting for four hours or more on Christmas.  So prior to coming I made reservations through yelp for Gordon Ramsey Steak inside Paris Hotel.\n\nI arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation for 6:45pm.  We weren't seated till 7:00pm but I let it slide due to the fact it was Christmas.  In front there is about five or six tall brunettes that seat guests. As they direct guests to their tables,  guests walk thru the tunnel into the Steakhouse and one of the brunettes will say \"You have been transported from Paris to London\".  Then she proceeds to take you to your table.  \nGreat, I'm in London. (Music is thumping) Is London always this loud?  Don't take mom here for Mother's Day... Ambiance is more for a younger party crowd.\n\nThe server came promptly with an iPad to order drinks.  The water and drinks come very quick.  The service is what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant.  Here's what we ordered:\n\nShellfish Platter $75: this came out on a three tier platter.  It had Tiger Prawns, King Crab, Lobster Tail, Clams, and Oysters.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  There were about four dipping sauces to choose from.  \n\nMac & Cheese $12:  every famous chef, steakhouse, soul food restaurant, etc have their own version of this dish.  Gordon Ramsey has a good version.  Not the best but good nonetheless.  Interesting to me while in Vegas is that Mac & Cheese is close to $20 at many places.  But Gordon keeps it reasonable with his prices all around for the most part.\n\nBeef Wellington $52:  tender is the first word that comes to mind.  It's a nice amount of medium rare meat roasted in the pastry.  I'd give it 4 stars.\n\nBone-in Ribeye $58:  this was the best part of our meal.  Tender, delicious, juicy 24 once steak.  I know the Beef Wellington is Gordon's specialty and its difficult to make yadda yadda, but the ribeye out shines the Wellington.  It's the Beyonce out shining the rest of Destinys Child.  Boootylicious.\n\nOne bad note is the restroom looks like I really was transported to a London Pub Restroom, dirty and yuck.  Just hold it till you get back to your suite.  \n\nTotal bill was around $216. It's pricey but less than many of the other steakhouses in Vegas.  Excellent service, good food, and worth trying."

It was properly browned on the outside and cooked just to medium on the inside as I requested.  It had a nice aged flavor to it.  What really agravated me was the knife they gave me.  It was basically a serrated butter knife with a tiny, slim handle.  I was struggling to trim the ribeye as that useless instrument refused to cut and slipped between my fingers.  I requested a real steak knife and the waiter said they had nothing else.  A steakhouse with no steak knives?  Bollocks!  The $13 smashed potatoes side was very small, and was actually a very runny potatoe puree.  The flavor was average at best.  My girlfriend's short rib was way too fatty, even by short rib standards.  The mushrooms and spinach that came with it were both painfully salty.  When the bill came I noticed I was charged $9 for bottled water.  Apparently they don't serve tap water.  On the plus side the water had a very clean, smooth taste."

The brussel sprouts were very good and weren't drenched in cheese as the sometimes are so you could taste the greens. The beef Wellington was a different type of steak that you don't find at most steak restaurants. The outside crust was flaky and the inside was a nice red center. I'd say the cut of meat wasn't epic but the dish itself was solid. Overall all the dishes were portioned too small but cooked to perfection. No complaints about the waitstaff or anything else regarding the restaurant. The total bill was about $250 for 2 which is actually remarkably reasonable for Las Vegas.

It was so good that we ordered another round! Next, I shared the Kobe sliders as an appetizer. It was advertised as having Cheddar and caramelized onions, but all I could taste was the mustard seed seasoning. I am not a mustard fan, and after about three bites I was done. Next I got the beef Wellington which is the whole reason I was excited to go there. Again, all I could taste was the mustard seed seasoning in the beef. I was very disappointed. The pastry and the garnishes on the plate were delicious, so I just ate those. I also got a side of macaroni and cheese which was passable, but the taste of the blue cheese was a little overpowering. Dessert was cheesecake, which was flavored with lemon for some reason. It came with strawberries and blueberries so there was no reason for it to be \"enhanced\" with lemon. Overall, it was a fun (albeit expensive) experience. Perhaps my palette is unrefined, but I can't see how covering up beef with mustard is ever a good idea. Unless you like mustard, I guess."

            "review": "Was super excited to try this steakhouse by Gordon Ramsay.  I love watching Hell's Kitchen & all his other restaurant rescue shows so I had high expectations of this place. Especially since we just tried his amazingly delicious burgers & fries at #GordonRamsayBurGR , I was looking forward to the steak dinner even more. But this place disappointed me very much. \n\nOur server was nice and the experience started out great with him showing us the different cuts of meat on their meat display. Then came the complimentary bread & butter, which had a few tasty variety of breads, and the tomato salad we ordered was also very good.  \n\nAfter having our salad appetizer & comp bread we waited for our entrees to come out. After an hour of waiting I was starting to get antsy & there was a constant cold breeze from the AC that didn't help with the wait either. Our waiter must have noticed that I wasn't happy because after my friend mentioned that I looked \"hangry\" he came by and told us to please be patient & that great things come within time. \n\nOk, by this time I was still giving them the benefit of the doubt that maybe it'll be like his tv shows where people waited long but was so satisfied with their food that it made their wait worth it. Our reservation was at 7:00pm and our entrees finally came out around 9:00pm. Unacceptably long wait for any restaurant, especially for one that's representing Gordon Ramsay. \n\nSo finally our entrees came out and immediately I can tell that my Bone-in Ribeye was overcooked because it was a lot firmer than I'm used to when cutting into it. After eating a piece it was certainly overcooked to my liking. I had ordered my steak to be \"blue\", which is rarer than rare, but it came out pink, which is about medium well. Way off! I even cut my steak straight down the middle to check maybe it's rarer in the middle. Nope. \n\nThe atmosphere was so dark with red accent lighting that it just made all of our steaks look the same color so I turned on the flashlight on my phone to check the color of my steak. Our server noticed & came over to ask how things were. I told him that my steak was nowhere close to rare & he genuinely tried to correct it by offering me another ribeye.  But I declined because I really didn't want to wait an additional hour for another steak and I wasn't giving any chances of someone in the kitchen to spit in my food for sending it back.\n\nMust have been an off day for the chef because it wasn't just mine that got screwed up. One friend who also ordered it rare got one like mine and another who ordered hers medium got a well-done steak (which she said was dry & tough).  Also, after we were done eating, our food was taken away without being asked if any of us wanted it boxed to take home and some of us had a whole 1/2 steak left but it was ok because most of us wasn't keeping it anyways. \n\nOne friend took the servers suggestion of ordering the Ribeye Cap & that was delicious. All the sides we ordered were very good - Brussel sprouts, corn, truffle mac n cheese, baked potato. For dessert we ordered the \"Toffee Sticky Cake\" & the \"Carrot Cake\".  The sticky cake was great while the carrot cake was just meh. But it was a nice gesture from our waiter to have comped us on one of the desserts.  \n\nAlthough the sides and dessert tasted good, it wasn't great enough to overrule the long wait and disappointing steak. And to top it off, we were thinking of doing a show after dinner but because our dinner took up over 3 hours there were no more showings by the time we were done eating. \n\nThe meat quality here is superb tho. I can see lots of nice marbling throughout the meat. Just wished that they could have delivered up to expectation, especially with a $$$$ sign on Yelp. Would need #GordonRamsay himself to redeem this one. Was so let down."

She recommended the most amazing drink called the southside. She did a good good explaining the different cuts of steaks. She made sure that we were very educated before we placed our dinner order.  We had the beef tartare for an appetizer.....Excellent! We ordered the beef Wellington and the American wagyu/Kobe steak  with macaroni and cheese for dinner, which was the absolutely amazing. The whole meal was over $200, but is was well worth it. I will try another Gordon Ramsay restaurant on our next trip to Vegas."

Next we had the gnocchi that was really good when it came out since it was hot.  When we finished it up, it was cold and not as good.  Eat it hot!  We also got the Chorizo stuffed Lobster appetizer.  The lobster was tender but a bit fishy for my taste.  My friends liked it more than I.   Of course, we had to get the Beef Wellington.  The fillet was nicely cooked but the pastry was not rolled tightly enough so there was a big space between the meat and pastry and it was missing seasoning.  I was disappointed.  I felt it was bland, although the fillet was very tender.  On the other hand, the Rib Eye was very tasty but tough and sinewy.  The char was delicious but it was way to chewy and not tender at all. We finished with the very delicious, Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The brown butter ice-cream was creamy and flavorful.  The pudding was yummy."

I expected so much more from Gordon Ramsay.\nFirst let me say, the restaurant is big and noisy and I felt like it was more of a steak mill then a personal experience.  The staff was arrogant, except for our server's assistant who was lovely. Our table was upstairs with a view of the servers hallway, the elevator and the washstand.  We asked to move and they graciously did seat us downstairs at a much better table.\nThe \"meat\" trolley is ridiculous. Rattles with round mirrors showing the marbleing of the meat. It's big and doesn't fit in the crowded areas well.\nThe drinks were amazing and the pre-dinner selection of breads and butter with sea salt was delicious.\nWe ordered Beef Wellington for two, ceasar salad, no appetizers. The server seemed a bit annoyed and informed us that it would take 40 minutes to prepare. OK.\nWe started with the ceasar salad, nothing special. It came with a scotch egg, but other than that, meh.\nThe wellington arrived, close to the 40 minute window. The filet was amazing. Tender and perfectly cooked. The pastry was a bit soggy and it all seemed cold, but overall it was seasoned perfectly.\nWe passed on dessert.\nBill= $200, not bad for 4 drinks a salad and the wellington, considering the name.\nSorry Gordon but there are too many amazing restaurants in Vegas. I won't be back."

Here's a tip, it's hard to get reservations, but you can sit in the bar, which has some great tables. Best time to go to the bar is after 9:00 pm, since most people in there are waiting on their reservations. Service in the bar area was perfect! I went with the recommended order\n\nThe Foie Gras was out of this world. I hate hate Foie Gras, my parents force me to eat it as a kid. But this tastes nothing like the cold slimy stuff. This literally hit your tongue and melted into my tongue. If you get anything on the menu that is the one thing you can't miss. \n\nI had the Beef Wellington, it was good, but not the best I had. The cut of meat was very high quality and it was cooked perfectly, however it needed more sauce accompaniment to make it phenomenal.  Finally for dessert you have to order the brown sugar caramel with brown butter ice cream. It sounds weird, but is rich and years up your taste buds. The secret to eating it is to combine all three ingredients in each bite. Then you get the full effect of the cream mellowing the sweetness. \n\nThe Pre-meal bread was blah...\n\nThe cocktails were fun...\n\nThe wine list was light...\n\nBut all in all if you have a few hundred bucks burning a hole in your pocket there is no better gastronomical place to spend it."

I've had better at other high end places (still my favorite is Michael Mina's in San Francisco) \n\nFirst of all, the service was OH SO SLOW!! After we sat down (no wait since we had reservations, although there was no line either on a Sunday night), we waited a few minutes for a waiter.  After he asked if we wanted some cocktails, he left us with the ipad cocktail menu for ten minutes.  After we made our drink orders, we still did not get our regular food menu.  I think maybe he was waiting for that damn meat cart to be available to show us the different cuts of meat they serve.  It was kinda cool to see a meat cart, but I didn't really care for it - I know what a ribeye or filet looks like.\n\nWe ordered the asparagus soup (FUCKEN AMAZING) - if nothing else, just order this.  You'll still be starving cuz the portion is super tiny, but at least it tasted damn good.  The lobster appetizer was tiny (3 inch long lobster - 3 bites and it was gone).  The beef wellington was unimpressive.  the pastry was not amazing, it was just ok.  I also didn't like the weird smell/taste of the foie gras that was smeared between the meat and the pastry.\n\nThe sides were thoroughly unimpressive.  The corn had the weird stringy thing that you find on corn that was not well cleaned (you know that residual string from the husk of the corn), and the mushrooms were SO SALTY!!! \n\nThe tuna chopped salad was ok (the tuna was nice, the sauce was a little salty).\n\nOverall, the only amazing food highlights were the asparagus soup and the side of potato puree.  Otherwise, everything else we had was just mediocre given the price point of this restaurant.\n\nGiven Gordan Ramsey's TV personality for being a perfectionist, this meal was anything but.  I will not return, nor will I recommend this to a friend looking for fine dining."

My wife has been wanting to try out Gordon Ramsay Beef Wellington as it has been the main signature dish for Gordon Ramsay. The entrance was great, they call it the chunnel which was supposed to be an ode to the connection between France and UK Channel + tunnel although I dont understand why the chandeliers had to be explained by the servers. Anyway on to the food. Since we are asian we are used to the beef being well done the rarest we would go for is medium. Beef wellington comes only medium rare. My wife went ahead and ordered the beef wellington and the taste was pretty good expectation were definitely met. The beef wellington was consumed in a few short minutes :).  I on the other had the 24 oz steak which is good. I should have tried the Wagyu version since I can cook the steaks I should have gotten something that I cant get at home although the meat was aged 28 days the taste is the same as the aged beef in Whole Foods or from our local butcher shop. The Service was very good which is expected since it is an expensive restaurant. The sides were great we had the octopus Remoulade salad which was done very well, octopus if cooked long becomes tough in Gordon Ramsay Steak it was soft.    The mac and Cheese with truffle butter was REALLY good I like the idea that the twist was using truffle oil in the mac and cheese and it tasted really good. We will definitely try other things on the menu if we decide to go on another dinner date at Gordon Ramsay Steak."

Everything I ordered they got on spot and never told us to repeat anything. I could just tell they were professionals. They showed us every steak on the menu with a cart and explained each one thoroughly and told us what they recommended.\n\nThe food is just unbelievable. I ordered the American rib cat which was so flavorful and tender I almost died from the first to the last bite. That was the best steak I have ever had and I totally recommend getting the American rib cat. It also was plated beautify along with everything else I ordered.\n\nOverall, breath taking steak house. I was looking forward to coming to this restaurant for about five years and had high expectations, but this restaurant went over my expectations. Absolutely without a doubt, the best steak house I have ever been too and definitely is one of my favorite all time restaurants. If you come to Vegas, go to Gordon Ramsey Steak if you can afford it.

Everyone seems to say the Beef Wellington is amazing. So I figured that would be a safe bet. Sadly it was bland city. I do not know if I was unlucky and had the lone poorly seasoned Wellington. Or possibly I was spoiled by eating at Fleur for lunch and having the most amazing meal of my trip there.\n\n The bartenders all kept asking me how it was, expecting me to say mind blowing apparently. The meat was lovely and soft. But sadly it was such a dull dish. My bartender was Alan. Cool guy. Very friendly. My drink was ok. The bread tray with the yummy butter and volcanic salt was good. One was amazing actually. The circle bread that was not truffled.\n\nOnto the great! Sticky Toffee Pudding. YUM!! Now that was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed that. It helped the pain of paying 54$ for the wellington that was just ok. All in all it was an ok experience. The decor was cool. The service was great(I did get a dirty look for wearing sandals in but I didn't want to trek all the way back to my hotel. I would have done the same if I worked there to be honest lol) And the food was lackluster for the price. But many other reviews rave about the Wellington so maybe I did just get unlucky. But if you go you MUST get the Sticky Toffee pudding. As the bartender so perfectly put it, \"Isn't it Sinful?\" Perfect dessert for Sin City."

I read the other reviews, and I mean I read almost every one of them, but I'm glad I did because it gave me some ideas of what items to order. What I found to be consistent was that even the people that gave bad reviews liked at least one item. The Beef Wellington, macaroni & cheese, and the Sticky toffee pudding dessert were among the top items liked. \n\nWe arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and we were sat immediately, so this was a great start. When we were lead in by the hostess we were given the little tour/explanation of the design and the decor and you could tell that she had given this spiel so many times that she was just going through the motions.  But we didn't really care anyway.  When we were seated, we were greeted almost immediately and given a drink menu. Again, another good start. After the meat cart presentation, we ordered the Beef Wellington, and Macaroni and Cheese, as well as fingerling potatoes and the Kobe rib cap.  We were told that the Wellington may take a few extra minutes but we didn't mind the wait and we appreciated the heads up.  We were brought bread before the meal.  It was a variety of different types of bread.  We especially liked the prosciutto pinwheels.   \n\nOur meal arrived sooner than expected, it was presented beautifully, and the taste was incredible. The Wellington and the Rib cap truly melted in your mouth and the macaroni and cheese and fingerling potatoes were a wonderful addition to the meal.  The smokey flavors in both side dishes matched perfectly with the beef.  After many minutes of silence at our table, we started to get full, and we had only eaten half of the meal. The portions were plenty for us.  We knew we had to save a little room for the Sticky Toffee Pudding and we are so glad we did.  It was unbelievably good.  The butter ice cream was amazing!\n\nBy far this was one of the best meals we have had and we will be returning every time we make it to Vegas.  If you have not been there, you have to at least try it once to form your own opinion, we are so happy we did.  The service, food, and atmosphere were top notch."

After asking me some brief questions, and speaking with his staff about our experience, I was offered a credit to come back and try it again.  Since it's in Las Vegas it was 14 months before we were in the area again, but last week my wife and I returned.  I emailed the manager, expecting that it might be someone new, or that they would have forgotten about me by that time and we would likely not be able to take them up on their offer after so much time had elapsed.  19 minutes after I emailed I received a prompt response saying they had made a reservation for me and that they looked forward to changing my opinion during a second visit.\n\nTL:DR - They succeeded in a big BIG way!\n\nMy wife, her mother and I returned to Gordon Ramsay Steak over the weekend.  We were greeted upon arrival by the manager who reiterated that they were going to \"make it right\" when compared to our original experience.  Our entire experience was absolutely amazing!  Service was attentive and quick, the food was great, the drinks were tasty and cold, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure our return trip lived up to expectations.  \n\nSome things we ordered:\n\nSide Car cocktail - Very tasty, sweet and tart with a pretty good kick at the end.\n\nAmerican Kobe Rib Cap - Oh my dear lord, this cut of beef was amazing! Cooked to a perfect medium just like I asked, tender, tasty, charred to perfection. I've had a lot of steak in my life, and this was perhaps the best steak I have EVER had anywhere.\n\nBeef Short Rib - Glazed to perfection, but not sickly sweet like some places do their short ribs.  More of a savory glaze that really fit. Cooked to perfection where the meat flakes off the bone.\n\nRoasted Chicken Breast - This was possibly the best chicken I've ever had (I only had a piece, but my wife raved about it).  As my wife said, it was the most \"chicken-y\" flavor she's ever had on a chicken breast dish. Skin on, bone in, certainly helps with that, and the pan sauce likely helped as well. If you're not a beef fan, you can't go wrong with this one. Even the pilaf with wild rice and couscous, not usually a favorite of hers, was a hit.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding and Brown Butter Ice Cream - As usual, this was moist and sweet without being overwhelmingly so (the savory ice cream helps with that). I'm not sure if they puree the dates in a blender, there's definitely dates in there, but you couldn't find a chunk if you tried. I've tried to recreate the sauce that they make for this dish at home for my Christmas Pudding, but as close as I can get, it's never quite the same. You could just pour the pitcher into my mouth and I'd be a happy man. If you go to ANY Ramsay restaurant you must try this.\n\nAt the end of they day they really won us back at Gordon Ramsay Steak. Our server was amazing and when they brought us the bill, the only things on it was a bottle of water and the Sticky Toffee Pudding, a total of $25. We tipped our server generously (I think it was $60 but I could be of $10 either way on that) and again the manager came by on our way out to make sure everything lived up to expectations and to offer help again in the future.\n\nConsider my rating on this restaurant forever changed."

            "review": "The food was amazing.  I would have given this 5 stars except that the staff and service were not very good.\n\nWe were seated in the back, offset from the cooking station.  The first problem with this area was this is also the area the servers congregate to place orders and talk.  I watched multiple servers talk after we were seated (including our own) and ignore us for a few minutes so that they could continue their conversation.  Because I was facing the serving station, I watched all of the interactions between staff - instead of my husband.  We were here on our honeymoon and the staff interactions drew my attention away from my new spouse.\n\nThe second issue I had with the staff was the distinction between servers and busers.  Our buser appeared to be an African immigrant and was treated very poorly by the servers.  I watch multiple servers yell at him, and tell him to keep up with his work as they laughed and carried on.  He was still very jovial in spite of the fact that he was constantly yelled at.  He treated the guests (and us) far better then our server, but I was highly disturbed by the treatment.  I watched one server pick up a dirty napkin from a table and throw in on a pile of clean napkins that this gentleman was folding and walk away.  The \"class disparity\" is just unacceptable.\n\nMy final issue with the server is two-fold: first, the server was not clear about the difference between bottled water and tap water.  We had no idea we ordered bottled water until we got a bill for $9/bottle.  Second, I told the server I had a nut allergy and he served me bread with nuts.  When I asked him if there were nuts in the bread, he blamed the African buser who came over and apologized.\n\nThe food was excellent (by far the best steak I have ever had), but I really wish the experience was a better one."

            "review": "My husband and I had a wonderful experience at GRS this past weekend while we were in Vegas. We made our reservation a week in advance and we were seated promptly on arrival. Our table was about middle of the mezzanine, which I really, really enjoyed. I didn't get to watch the kitchen but GR wasn't there anyway and the view of the restaurant was lovely. Our hostess was kind and polite, and explained the different features of the restaurant (like the chunnel and the neon sculpture on the ceiling) and then asked if we wanted to take the elevator or the stairs to our table (we opted for the elevator just because). \n\nOur Waiter (Shawn) was absolutely wonderful and our assistant waiter (I am not sure we got his name) was on top of everything, from making sure our water glasses were always full to quietly replacing the butter knife I dropped within 2 minutes, without me even having to say a word. They even refolded my husband's napkin when he left the table. The only thing we had to ask for was a straw for my drink when it got too low. \n\nI know a lot of people have complained about the volume of the music, and maybe they've lowered it a little from when those reviews were made or just since the opening but I did not find it at an uncomfortable level. That isn't to say it wasn't fairly loud, I mean it wasn't as soft as say department store, but it wasn't to an ear blowing decibel. My husband and I had no problems talking to one another in a normal tone of voice and could still hear conversations at the two tables next to us. \n\nThe restaurant is somewhat noisy, but it's not... an unacceptable noisy. There were no overly loud or obnoxious tables. But, GRS isn't a place you go for a quiet, intimate dinner. It's a place you go to enjoy yourself, have fun, and have an amazing meal with incredible service. There was both a birthday party and a wedding reception going on while we were there (they have a banquet or party room) and there was no loudness from either party. We only knew there was a birthday table when the waiter brought out a sticky toffee with a candle in it and quietly wished him a happy birthday, and only knew of the wedding party after the bride and her small entourage went to the bathroom. \n\nMy husband and I shared the Lobster App, which was small and likely for only one, but we didn't want to fill up on anything before our actual meal. The pancetta pinroll was my favorite. Our Asst. Waiter brought me more without even having to ask for it. It was incredible hard to resist. I ordered the Wellington and found it positively amazing. Each bite melted away in my mouth and was gone before I even realized it. We also ordered the Bone Marrow, which was like this super buttery yummy fat rendering for the steak, and the fingerling potatoes, which were also quite good. For desert it was the Sticky Toffee. I couldn't finish my half of it because I was simply too full. \n\nAs a small note; Sides are for at least two people! If not three or four! Order one or two and share, this includes the baked potato! Just cut that sucker in half, it's huge! We didn't order it, but a table near us did and I swear the sucker was the size of my forearm! \n\nWe honestly had no complaints on this place, or the service. If I had to strive for something to complain about it's that the Wellington is only cooked to rare. They won't cook it to any other degree, which is fine for me, I love a rare steak. But for my husband, who had been looking forward to a Wellington for two weeks and only eats his steaks Medium-Well it was a slight derailment and disappointment. After all they do cook the Wellington to various degrees on Hell's Kitchen! So he ended up ordering the Kobe Filet instead. For shame huh? Even at Medium-Well (it was more medium really) that steak melted on my tongue. \n\nI know a lot of people have complained about charred steaks and dry chicken... my only question is WHY DID YOU NOT SEND IT BACK?! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! You're paying $50+ for your meal and it comes out wrong so you opt to \"choke it down\" and then complain about it? Ugh! I seriously do not understand some people..."

            "review": "One of the \"must-dos\" when visiting Vegas is to try some celebrity chief restaurants. This time, my friend recommended Gordon Ramsay Steak House. His famous Beef Wellington is the reason why we visited. The restaurant is located in Paris Hotel and is decorated as one of the best high-end restaurants. We made the reservation in advance to avoid the long line. The server quickly sat us down and settled in for an amazing dinning adventure. They brought out all the selections of their meat on a display and showed how they look like so we can better select what kind of steak for the night. That was an excellent way to show how good this restaurant is. \nOf course, we started out with drinks. They offer wide variety of selections, from wine, craft deer, to special designed cocktails. Overall, we tried about 7 different cocktails and beers. That definitely made us very happy and ready for a big meal. You can't go wrong with their cocktails so ask the waiter to give you some pointers depends on your preference. \nThe dinner began with an assorted bread platter. It was not particularly impressive or memorable. It was really just simple breads. To be honest, it was a slightly disappointing start because I expect a real high-end restaurant to be focused on all details of the dinning experience, including bread. But, oh well, we quickly moved to appetizers. Their BEET SALAD was amazing! Fresh beet was dressed with excellent sauce. Very refreshing start and really made a good first impression. The SMOKE BEEF TARTATE had a lavish opening. The waiter served the dish with smoke kept inside a cover and then opened the cover to show how the beef tartate was \"smoked\". The presentation was excellent along with the yukon chips on the side. Overall, the beef tartare was good. The texture of beef tartare was great for me. The flavor was playful with different layers, egg yolks, lemon zest, onion, and capers. However, it was slightly underseasoned. The yukon chips were cold and stale and did not provide the crunchy texture needed for the tartare. Unfortunately, this dish could be better executed in my opinion. Their SEARED HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAS was excellent. The goat cheese pop overs were great with the foie gras. \nSince the beef wellington typically takes about 45 minutes to make, the appetizer definitely kept us busy and enjoying the dinning in a nice pace. Finally, the ROASTED BEEF WELLINGTON showed its glory. This highly skilled dish is nothing like I have seen before. The filet steak was cooked to medium rare as designed and wrapped in the middle of puffy pastry. It was an impressive dish! Really took my breath away with the details and all the culinary skills. The beef was well seasoned with mushroom paste and ham. With just one bite of the dish, you know why you came here! I love the flavor of the wellington with pastry, mushroom, and beef. However, I wasn't too much a fan of the texture because I am more used to charred, sizzling steak. Overall, the beef was soft but dense in the bite. It also took me off guard that a steak is served at room temperature. I was hoping to get a hot piece of wellington that just came out of the oven with beef also hot inside. However, I realized that's not the way how beef wellington is made and served. It really took me a while to get over a \"cold\" beef in my mind. Nonetheless, this is one of the most skilled steak dish you can have and Gordon Ramsay certainly knows how to do it perfectly. One thing to note is that all beef wellington is served medium rare so people who like their steak medium well or well done are not be a fan. Instead, you can try other cut of steaks offered at their steak house. My friend ordered their bone-in NEW YORK STRIP and it was amazing!!!! It was absolutely excellent piece of beef and cooked perfectly with charred outside. Simply seasoned to allow the real beef flavor to shine. I recommend to order both beef wellington and other prime beef so you can try different steaks here. We also ordered some sides to go with our steaks. SRIRACHA ROASTED BROCCOLI and GINGER GLAZED SHIITAKES were both pretty good with Asian inspirations. Finally we finished the dinner with PENNA COTTA and TOFFEE PUDDING. By this point, I was so buzzed and full that I can't even remember how the dessert were. I am sure they were fantastic as the rest of the meal. \nSo overall I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating despite I enjoyed our dinner. The reason was there were points along the way that I think they could do better. For a restaurant that we spent over $600 for a meal, I need perfection and need to be blown away completely! I am likely to return and conserve by my stomach space to just their steaks. I want to focus on trying their best dish and not to be overly stuffed with appetizers, bread, drinks, or dessert. So, until next time, 4-star it is for me!"

Here's the reason for the 1 star:\nAt the end of service we presented the Diamond card and told the service we wanted to use the comps.  We all know how long it takes to earn $300 in comps!\n\nThe server came back and said the card did not work. He could not use the comps so I put it on a credit card.  A month later we were able to find out through Caesars they did in fact take the comps off the account!  They were paid twice for the meal!\n\nSo after a few back and forths the restaurants says they can't do anything.  They don't see the comps.  I have the record for them taking my credits AND my credit card receipt.  RIDICULOUS!\n\nI love Ramsay's burger place and did love this until I learned what a bunch of scam artists they are.  So disappointed!!\n\nAll in all I paid over $600 for the meal. For a $300 meal it was good; not for twice that.  \n\nGordon, who do you have running this place?  As a Vegas local who goes to nice restaurants on the strip several times a month, this is not one I will be returning to.  I'll do Carnevino or Holmstead.  Better service and not scammers."

Who can describe the experience for me :D \n\nBut I will say, the service was impeccable, Gordon Ramsays Wellington was by far the best piece of meat I believe you will ever try. Even for a fillet, it was packed with so much flavor. With not a fiber of fat on it, cut like wet, juicy meat sponge, and just dissolved on your tongue. The NY cut was also probably one of the more tender pieces of a NY I have also ever had. Marbling was wonderful. A true test for La Freida Meats... They win in my book. \n\nThe wife's Market Green Salad was delicious, even if it was just a house salad. I truly recommend the Pork Belly appetizer also. The rendered fat, with the succulent piece of meat on it, combined with the saut\u00e9ed swiss chard...a wonderful salty, nutty, sweet experience.  \n\nAnd I am so happy for our waiters assistant for constantly reminding us about the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Of course all of the reviews and photos on here didn't steer us away from it either. Along with the dessert, the Columbian Roast steeped freshly from the French Press was out of this world. \n\nWould definitely return. Don't let go of what"

Apparently most places don't even sell this meat so if you're here you should go for it.  The rest of the meal consisted of the American Filet, American Rib Cap, Mac & Cheese, Cream Fraiche Corn and the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert.  Everything was amazing but the corn and dessert were definite favorites.  Loved everything about the ambiance from the \"tunnel\" to the art symbolizing the movements of Gordon's hand while he makes the food. Overall amazing food and an amazing way to celebrate my birthday."

I added a sauce which was a bone marrow in red or white wine. Pretty good but a little salty. The restaurant lives up to its' name. The setting is pretty dark and red inside.\nTheir service was excellent! Someone is always making sure you enjoyed your food and pouring water for you when your cup gets emptied or half full. \n\nTRY the beef wellington, brussel sprouts (has bacon in it)  & mac & cheese! The 3 best combo & for appetizer their lobster.. haha JUST TRY IT!!"

The staff remembered us from the night before and Michael the manager greeted us and thanked us for coming back. The atmosphere was nice and we hung out in the lounge having some champagne while waiting on our table. I have been waiting a while to try the beef Wellington and it was good but a little tough to cut. The duet of lamb the fella got was delicious as well. The staff worked well as a team to make sure that we had a great experience along with delicious food. I like being able to see the pass and the kitchen from parts of the first floor. I found the price to be fair for the cuts of meat that you are getting along with the location and the name. I would high recommend this place to anyone looking for a great date night and delicious steak. Atmosphere is loud and sociable so be cool with that or go elsewhere."

The food was fabulous as expected but the service was the best ever!  That staff is amazingly well trained and at the top of their game.  Our waiter - Jonathan - actually shook all of our hands warmly thanking us for coming and asking us to come back again.  That was a first for me and I have dined in many excellent establishments over the past 60 years.  Gordon Ramsay should be proud the way his staff represents his name.  We all decided that this restaurant is now a \"must do\" on future trips to Vegas."

I made the reservations through open table and left a note on there that it was his Birthday. The minute we arrived, the hostess greeted us and immediately said Happy Birthday to my boyfriend. Attention to detail. ..awesome. She took us to our table which was on the 2nd floor over looking the dining room below...awesome. We were greeted by Donnie with an ipad that had pictures and descriptions of the drinks. He was very well put together, very knowledgeable, and greeted my boyfriend with a Happy Birthday. Thank you Donnie.... \n  We ordered our drinks and then the amazing plate of bread came to the table which was described in detail...service is impeccable here. Donnie brought over the meat cart and explained every piece of meat in full detail. We looked at the menu, ordered when Donnie came back and that was that. \n   Our appetizers came...beet root salad for me and kobe beef sliders for the man. It was perfect. Seriously to die for. Dinner came...and I do have to say the food we had....Kobe filet and shoulder cap...The best. Donnie, you made some great recommendations and everything was perfect.  Our sides of creamed spinach and potatoes were melt in your mouth awesome. Our dessert? What else? Sticky toffee pudding. No words. No words for the amount of perfect buttery awesomeness. Perfect food, IMPECCABLE service from our server Donnie and the rest of the staff.  Thank you for making my boyfriends Birthday amazing. Ask for Donnie when you go in......what an experience :)"

Sticky toffee pudding still one of best desserts on planet. Service slightly stilted. Had to get waiter's attention to let him know we had need finished eating for 10-15 minutes and request dessert menus. A forgotten drink. Coffee served after dessert finished. But still would have been solidly 5 stars. Got check. Wife immediately noticed check was wrong (regular prices instead of total rewards (Caesar's program) but check indicated Total Rewards discount applied at top. I assumed because discount indicated at top she was wrong. But as we left she pointed out prices on menu on marquee. I then had to walk back in on principle (550 bill vs. 530 bill). First, he argued with me (but I got definite sense he knew...waiter at a restaurant of that calibre is aware of menu pricing) then conceded. Then deferred to manager. Who then had me wait 13 minutes. I got tired of waiting. Approached manager and asked if we could speed it up (wife and kids outside waiting) and snapped my fingers in a 'can we speed it up motion.' Response was 'don't snap your fingers at me! We are working on it.'  No apology. Defrauded me out of 18 bucks, but I am the jerk. Get money. Left. Never an apology. \nReally spoiled expensive meal. You would think Ramsay wouldn't tolerate this. I will not. Plenty of places on strip I can drop 600 hundred plus on a meal. Oh well. Check your bill."

            "review": "This is my first (and possibly only) five star rating. I have a very stringent scale for rating, and only hand out high marks for the best of the best. That being said, here's my review:\n\nMy friends and I met in Vegas to have a fun weekend in June 2012, and they left most of the planning up to me. I searched around and came across the fact that Gordon Ramsay had a steak house there. I'm a huge fan of GR (but not Hell's Kitchen, more Master Chef), so I couldn't pass up the chance to check it out. I made the reservations and was able to keep it a surprise to the others until the moment we pulled up in our cab. They totally freaked out, which was gratifying, and I knew I had made the right choice.\n\nThe Service: We stood in the reservation line to be seated, and took in the decor. It's awesome. We were promptly seated, and ready to start our GR Steak adventure. The wait staff was phenomenal. They catered to our every need. They asked if we'd like to review the tasting menu, and explained that if one of us ordered it, we all would have to. However, I was there for steak, so we turned it down. Then our main waiter presented the menu, explained some of our options, and brought us the meat cart. I think I died and went to heaven.\n\nI'd like to stop here and give a huge shout out to the assistant waiter. He never left our water glasses empty, filled our wine glasses promptly, and did a fabulous job of making sure we were taken care of. I'd also like to explain the water pouring process, which included the server putting a napkin towards the customer when pouring so that no water was splashed on to the patron. Now that's some fancy stuff right there.\n\nThe head sommelier (wine expert dude) came to our table. He wanted to introduce himself and ask if we had any questions. We actually did. The extensive wine list, presented to our table on an iPad (an iPad for the love of god!), was overwhelming for people who don't know wine from blowing bubbles. We told him what we liked and he personally fetched us a bottle of wine to sample. When we weren't quite satisfied with the flavor, he personally mixed us our own bottle using two different kinds of wine (don't ask, because I don't know). It was fabulous, and the price tag didn't give me a heart attack. \n\nThe Food. Our table of four ordered the seafood platter as an appetizer, which was presented on an ice sculpture placed onto a pewter octopus. You may want to re-read that line because of the sheer awesomeness it entails. The platter included king crab leg, lobster tail, oysters, clams, and giant prawns. Tears of joy are streaming down my face as I write this.\n\nFor our meals two of us ordered the Kobe rib cap, one of us ordered the Kobe filet, and who cares what the fourth one ordered because I wanted to steal that filet and run out of the restaurant with it and make love to it. Seriously. It was that good. We also ordered the grilled asparagus, the mashed potatoes, two of the smashed fingerling potatoes, a bone marrow sauce for our steaks, creamed spinach, and the mac and cheese. This was too much food. You really only need two, maybe three, sides to feed four adults. I'm fat, so you can trust me on this. I would pare it down to the asparagus, the fingerling potatoes, and the mac & cheese. In my opinion, those were the best ones.\n\nOverall: This was the best (and most expensive) meal of my life, and I'll probably never get to go again. But it was worth it. It's been more than 2 months since I've been there, and I can still write this fabulous review with all of these details, because I've thought about it every day since.\n\n(edited for typos - sorry!)"

For the price I was looking for a little more wow factor since all the reviews I read are about their wellington. I was underwhelmed by the main entrees but had a glimmer of hope when we got to dessert which we shared the sticky toffee pudding. That dish made the whole dinner. So I was torn on what to rate this restaurant. I gave it a 3 because of the atmosphere, attentiveness of the staff and the pudding. We spent 240+ for two people and I think I wouldn't be in a hurry to come back because of the underwhelming experience with the entrees."

For sides, Tony (our waitor) recommended the fingerling potatoes and saut\u00e9d mushrooms. They were the perfect sides! Worth every penny....  We tasted 3 deserts! The chocolate layer cake was my wife's favorite and my favorite was the sticky toffee pudding. They can't be beat!! We were so impressed that we had to compliment the general manager, Jean Philippe. It was such a nice experience. As a teacher and a police officer, we are not used to the 5 star treatment. We found the staff and general manager to be very gracious and thankful for ours acalades.

If your wasting time waiting for people then it's a good place to try out. ONLY if you have not before. The steak was nothing fancy. We could get better steak somewhere else. But since it's Gordon Ramsey's restaurant it's worth a try. We walked out paying about $600 for 4 people. Which we weren't completely satisfied. It just took too much time for us to enjoy our food. Wouldn't come back unless it was free food and no wait."

She was very professional and her service was flawless.\n\nNow to the goodies...appetizers: fried oysters, 1/2 dozen raw oysters, & shrimp cocktail. All three were delicious but the fried oysters stood out. The tartar sauce was so creamy and had a perfect balance...my honeyyy even used it on the shrimp cocktail!\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Japanese A5 Kobe, Beef Wellington, Mac & cheese, & saut\u00e9ed spinach. The A5 Kobe stood up to it's reputation. Buttery, tender, pretty much the best thing I've ever tasted...but the beef Wellington competed very closely and was worth all the hype. The sides were just as scrumptious! We killed almost every bite. \n\nWe added two butter poached lobsters because as an aspiring chef, I wanted to explore this technique from the best. I was blown away by the execution of this technique. You have to taste it to really understand but I can say it was the most indulgent and tender piece of seafood I've ever experienced (coming from the northeast, that's saying a LOT)\n\nMy brother sent us the butter toffee dessert and although we aren't big on dessert, we attacked this because it was so good. We were both surprised when we looked down to an empty plate...again!\n\nWe will definitely return and had a memorable evening that surpassed my expectations."

They were knowledgeable, accommodating, spot on with recommendations for food and wine pairings.\n\nFlavors of the food were bold and mouth watering.  It sounds weird, but things like mushrooms actually tasted like mushrooms.  It probably comes from Gordon making sure everything is seasoned perfectly like on his shows.\n\nThe bread was a wonderful treat for the palate.  My favorite had to be the bread that looked like mini cinnamon rolls (without the frosting) and flavored with mushrooms or smoked pork belly.\n\nWe had the shellfish platter.  All of the seafood was fresh on a serving platter made of ice to keep it cold.  There were a few items that had a tomato jelly infused with sriracha and a few others with lemon and mint.  The both worked well with their items.  The rest had a few dipping sauces that complimented them beautifully.\n\nBest thing we had all night was our dessert.  We had  the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream as a few other reviewers suggested.  Perfectly sweet and rich and to die for with a cup of coffee.  I hope that one could get just that for take out, it is worth it.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe steak.....our table had a beef wellington and a bone in rib eye.  Both steaks were supposed to be medium rare but ended up more on the rare side.  The seasoning was lacking on both steaks.  It is a shame that they started with an exceptional aged steak beforehand and turned it into an above average product. \n\nThey were offering a chef tasting menu with beef wellington and a couple of other sides, and a  limited edition signed picture of Gordon Ramsay of which they are supposed to do maybe 830.  I was already thinking of trying the famous beef wellington so in my mind I am thinking sure why not?  The waiter explains though, that if I get the tasting menu, then everyone at the table has to get it as well.  What?!!  They are not going to be selling lots of those if that is the catch.\n\nOverall:\n\nAlmost all of the food was wonderful but the steak.  And being as the name of the restaurant has steak in it, therefore the four stars.  I will try it again in the future when it has been open for a while."

But not really because this restaurant is so awesome, so beautiful, so everything, that if you don't make this a stop on your trip through Sin City, then you have just missed the best restaurant you're going to find here.\n\nIf it isn't apparent, I'm a huge fan of steak restaurants. I love them like I love GR. So how perfect is it that he gave us this glorious restaurant for our very own? I KNOW.\n\nLet me begin by saying that if you want to know what great service is, start here. I'm pretty sure GR put the fear of death into these servers because they don't miss a beat. You ask for nothing, you send nothing back. Why? Because the amazing thing about this restaurant is just how perfect everything is. \n\nWalked in and as you're being escorted to your seat the hostess who is genuinely kind and informative, she points out some really nice touches. I'll let you find out what those are . She leads you through this tunnel-like entrance into the most beautiful restaurant; it gleams. It has this amazing staircase on either side of the restaurant. We were seated upstairs in the middle of this. It was the perfect location. Also, everyone is beautiful here. I'm pretty sure that wasn't planned, but thank you anyway. \n\nAs we sit down, we're greeted IMMEDIATELY by our waiter. I'm not going to be redundant so I'll just say that everything that happened, happened IMMEDIATELY.  Ordered drinks, perfection. Bread selection, perfection (and so, so delicious, soft bread, imported English butter, ugh, I'm fat now), VERY cool drink menu that you look at on an iPad (and clever!), dinner menus, tasting menus, so much to choose from, it's like an adult candy store, except replace the candy with meat.  \n\nI had the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye with a side of foie gras (yikes - addictive). It was a large cut of meat so I didn't finish TODAY, but don't worry, it WILL be finished. It was perfectly seared on the outside and warm and red on the inside. It had the perfect amount of marbling and was just the most tender steak I've had in this town. Just outstanding. As a side I had sauteed spinach - perfect, perfect, perfect, and asparagus with morels, white asparagus puree and a veal demi-glace - outrageously perfect. My date had the most perfect baked potato I've ever seen. It was huge, almost a meal by itself. It came with toppings that really were unique (smoked gouda b\u00e9chamel? Oh god) and delicious. It's by far the best potato anywhere I've ever been.\n\nDessert. Oh my. I can't begin to describe what it did to my taste buds, but suffice it to say that the sticky toffee pudding cake had me melting into a puddle from the deliciousness. Try it, you'll love it. \n\nLet me end this by saying that I love Gordon...oh wait, no, what I wanted to say was that this restaurant is my brand new favorite. It really was an amazing experience that I can't wait to repeat! And soon!"

            "review": "My husband has been looking forward to dining at Gordon Ramsey Steak house for months since we booked our mini getaway to Vegas. He's been a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey since I first met him. He followed many of the Gordon Ramsey's shows like Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmare, and Master Chef. We found it odd that the restaurant was located in one of the older casino - Paris; I think for a trendy restaurant like this would be better located at Aria, Cosmopolitan, or the Wynn in my opinion.\n\nWe had a reservation at 6:45pm; the hostess greeted us and another girl (hostess) took us in an imaginary \"transport portal\" inside the restaurant. The atmosphere was quite trendy and loud like a club. We were seated on the second floor which was 12 feet away from the loud speaker; for about 40min into the dining experience, my husband was annoyed by the loud music and we literally left the evening with a headache.  I would think a prestigious steakhouse would have more upscale feel.  Service was great from everyone except the girl who led us to our table, she sounded like she didn't want to be there and in a super low voice that we had to \"huh\" after every time she spoke a word. \n\nWell, Let's move on to the food: my husband ordered their famous beef wellington which he's been dying for; he thought the wellington was good but was not wow by it. First, the beef tenderloin tasted like it was cooked hours before we ordered. I guess this is the reason why there are no option to choose the way you want it other than medium rare; second, the buff pastry tasted like outer layer of a Chinese melon cake. Over all he was a bit disappointed; I think if the beef was cooked by Gordon himself, it would have been more memorable.\n\nI ordered the American Kobe, they had three choices to choose from. I chose the tri cut which was recommended by the waiter because is more closely to a rib eye. My first bite was like eating a thick layer of fat, I quit eating after my third bite because it was too heavy and greasy. I had tried Japanese Kobe before, compared to American Kobe it was not the same. I also ordered their foie gras, it was the best for the night, not because of the taste but the portion size of it; however, the foie gras was no comparison to Picasso at the Bellagio or Bouchon. We also ordered a side of asparagus which was over cooked. My husband and I wanted to the have some dessert, but the heaviness from the Kobe ruined our appetite.\n\nI don't think my husband would ever come back here again, unless Gordon Ramsey is making his appearance at the restaurant. It's a 3.5 stars from me."

A citrus type, a truffle light muffin, then a sliced baguette that was my favorite of the 3. Then we started with foie gras and pork belly. It was my first time eating foir gras and it was really mind over matter with me at first! But the taste is now still lingering in my smell buds and I want more!! The pork belly was the best pork belly dishes I've had at a few places. It wasn't just all fat! There was half fat and half meat. \nThen my family and I shared the short ribs, the porterhouse steak and some Kobe beef. Started off with the Kobe and it was so delicious words can't really describe the taste! The short ribs was so tender and flavorful!! We also got a side of the Mac & cheese..duh. Truffle Mac & cheese..I'll so take and it lived up to its name!! \nTo end the meal we got 2 desserts. The chocolate peanut butter bar & the milk chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me. The bar was a little too nutty but the chocolate brownie was not too sweet but sweet enough to finish off my flavor palate! \n\nOver all a wonderful experience! \n\nP.s. Spoke with a server and he said Gordon Ramsay isn't TV mean. He's a cool nice shake your hand when he sees you kind of guy!!"

We were not disappointed. \n\nIt was fate that the night we went, it was Hells Kitchen night, which featured a special menu and an autograph from Ramsey himself. It was a no-brainer, we went with the HK option. \n\nI'm a gin drinker and couldn't believe the assortment of gin cocktails they have. I opted for the English Garden and was beyond impressed-- so refreshing!  They also have an impressive craft beer selection which made my husband happy. The wine list was a mile long and also impressive. \n\nThe meal was lovely. The main dish was Beef Wellington-- the best I ever had. The risotto and scallops were perfect. The award winning toffee pudding knocked my boots off-- OMG... Pure heaven. \n\nThe waitstaff was attentive and friendly.  The decor and ambiance was fantastic. Even the music they played was good-- Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, etc. What an all around, cool place. Great experience."

That may sound a little sad, but the main courses (beef wellington and fish & chips) were very good, too (as was the sticky toffee pudding)."

You have always been one of my favorite chefs but I am terribly disappointed after spending almost $300 at your restaurant tonight.   It is pretty bad when you go out to eat and you can cook better than where you go to eat. We had the gnocchi and the carpaccio for appetizer and the bone in ribeye and my brother got another steak. My steak was absolutely the toughest most pathetic cut of meat I've ever seen in my life.  I could have used an electric knife.  \n\nHonestly the best part of the meal was probably the gnocchi, everything else was very average that I could've gotten for 40 or $50 and been just as happy or happier.  I should have gotten up and acted like an ass just like you."

We had the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu, and we loved every course - in my opinion the salmon beet salad was actually the best of the 4 - seriously, I know \"beet salad\" is usually nothing to write home about but there was more flavor-per-inch in this thing then I have ever tasted in my life.  The scallops with squid ink risotto, beef wellington, and scotch egg were all very good as well.\n\nThe staff was extremely attentive and very friendly, one of them even wheeled over their hilarious meat trolly for a second go-around so I could get a picture with it. Honestly my only complaint would be that the price was a little outrageous. $200 a plate was what it worked out to for my group of four, but hey, you pretty much know that going in so I can't complain too much."

The bone marrow was strange neither me or my husband enjoyed it. When ordering the steak the waiter brought all the steaks from the menu raw so you can see the difference. If you are a vegetarian this will be too graphic for you :) I ordered rib cap steak which is not the most expensive one but was really delicious and not too big. If you still have some appetite after the main course go for the caramel cake you can share."

When we first arrived, the hostess asked if we would like to take the stairs or elevator (I think it's common practice, but we noticed that none of the waiters were taking the elevator, so maybe they aren't allowed), we went through two big bottles of water because they were constantly refiling our glasses, and our waitress seemed overjoyed when we handed her a cash tip. \n\nFood: Perfect fish, perfect meat, perfect pastry, perfect perfect perfect perfect.

My boyfriend and I got waters, ordered one appetizer (Hamachi Crudo), two entrees (Beef Wellington and Seafood/Fisherman sampler), a side (truffle mac and cheese), and desert (blueberry tart).

Cooked perfectly, well balanced, and there are some \"food snob\" items along with some very basic but tasty items on the menu. The atmosphere is kind of pretentious (the hostess explained concept behind the huge, neon, chandelier/piece of art in the center of the dining room, etc.), but I chalk that up to the location, and Gordon Ramsay's idea of what a Vegas restaurant should look like.

We came on the 20th day the restaurant was open. heard he was there in person during the first week but wasnt there while we were dining BOOOOO! =[ the meat trolly they push to show case their meat is amazing, great visual if your indecisive about what you want. they had great wine and alcohol selection too bad the hubby and i had been drinking non-stop all weekend already and was no longer in any mood to drink anymore. they put their drinks menu on ipad like CUT. the service was impeccable! nothing short of stellar and attentive service! and  there was a tasting menu and if you do the tasting you get a special tasting menu with chef ramsays picture and autograph so of course that was a no brainer choice RIGHT? lol however the only way i could do the tasting is if the hubby also ordered the tasting and the hubby HATES tasting menu with a passion. he got quite upset and did the tasting with me although i insisted it would be okay and we didnt have to do a tasting. the great customer service really help the hubby become less grumpy about having to eat another tasting! lol we also ordered the oyster, the ale french onion soup and the foie gras. oyster and foie gras was unbelievably good. the onion soup i felt it was overpowered by the ale that i couldnt really taste anything but the ale. the hubby didnt enjoy it either. another great option is that you could order lobster along side your steak. for the tasting menu it started with a beet salad. the hubby complained there was no lettuce what so ever and how could it be a salad without lettuce. lol then next course was the asparagus soup, it was super yummy! finally the main was the beef wellington something ive wanting to try since the first season of hells kitchen. it was delicious except it lacked in presentation the crust was falling off the meat when it arrive and i hadnt even touched it yet. bummer! for dessert we panna cotta it was delicious but ive had it better at alexanders. =D dinner for two plus tip was 425. not too bad cant wait to return!"

It's lack of taste, not so much.  It was bland, very bland.  \n\nCaesar Salad - Do yourself a favor.  For $17, this salad was nothing special.  There was litterally 7 small pieced of lettuce on it, a million croutons, and a quail egg?  Maybe that's why it was so expensive?

We are huge fans of Chef Ramsay, and his keen attention to detail in the Kitchen. Having said that, we were shocked at lack of quality in the food.  Let me elaborate.\n     We really wanted to like this place, but for what we paid, $200+, we did not get what we paid for. The Dishes were way too salty. Over seasoned! My girlfriend and I are very easy going people. We have little to complain about. We do not enjoy writing negative reviews. But, since our food sucked, we want to spread the word about our experience.  One important note, the service was excellent, as was the atmosphere, but despite that, I can not justify giving more then one star especially when I am an unhappy customer.\n      I ordered the 8oz Rib Cap, and my girl the 24oz Bone In Ribeye. We shared the dishes. The first bite was good, but then we started to notice how salty the food was with each bite after. What a shame. Even the side dishes, which were ala carte, were also very high in salt. The amount of salty seasoning masked the original flavor of the food. Despite the fact the meat was tender and cooked perfectly, we could not even finish our dishes because of the seasoning, despite the fact we were so hungry. We took our food to go, and did not eat it. Sadly we won't be back. \n     This is not the Vegas experience we have come to know. I hope this post makes its was to the highest level of management so that the problem can be corrected, and other couples do not share the same disappointing experience we had, and throw away $200+.   Until then, we have since began to spread the word out via social media to see if others have had a similar experience that we did, and if anything is being done about it. If you too have experienced the same, spread the word.  Get this out on social media so what happened can be prevented.  \n      Final note, I went ahead and wrote a review on Paris Caesars Total Rewards site, and they took it down.  Pretty biased if you ask me.  I wrote a letter to management about our poor experience, and have yet to hear back. Thanks for reading and good luck."

I ate there a year ago and was impressed, but we were with a group and with conversation, didn't pay attention to the details.  \n\nFor meal, we showed up a little bit early and one of the hostesses informed us that they were getting a table ready and walked us the the bar to a couch to wait.  The bar staff was attentive even though we just ordered water... we had a drink at the Eiffel Tower bar before arriving.  A young hostess found us in the bar area and walked us to our table upstairs that was not what I was imagining for my perfect birthday dinner.  It was a small, two-top table at the exit for the staff area directly outside of the elevator. Our waiter took our wine order and the support staff was very attentive, but it wasn't the kind of table we expected for a fine dining experience.\n\nBefore our sommelier arrived with our wine, the nice young hostess came by to ask us how we liked our accommodations. I told her my concerns about the table and she said she would see what she could do.  We expected a move to a similarly tiny table in a better location.  However, the slender teenaged girl who, despite her age, was a consummate professional, informed us that we were being asked to accompany her to the chef's table.  We were walked back downstairs with the sommelier in tow to a fantastic booth that faced the kitchen and was directly in front of the executive chef's work area (if you were wondering... he doesn't slow all night and catches every detail.\n\nOur waiter, Chris, was a fantastic waiter.  He was detail oriented yet personal enough to connect while remaining a professional disconnect large enough to make sure that the dining experience was about me and my wife having  wonderful meal together.  He was there when we wanted him to be and was at the edges of the room at all other times in case he was needed.\n\nThe staff was unflappable in all situations and handled themselves professionally.  Assisting Chris was a wait staff assistant that missed nothing.  If water got 1\" low, he was there to refill it.  If my wife slipped off to powder her nose and her napkin was neatly folded 20 seconds after her departure.\n\nNow the food.  My wife ordered the rib cap and a lobster tail.  I ordered the 22 oz bone in ribeye medium-rare with an accompaniment of king crab legs.  We added the mushrooms and creamed spinach.  The steaks were absolutely perfect.  My ribeye was so good I told Chris that it made me want to \"smack my mamma.\"  I'm not sure he's accustomed to that.  I don't like creamed spinach, but I ate all of it.  It was like spinach crack. \n\nTo sum it up, our entire experience here was fantastic and made us feel like we were welcomed and the staff genuinely wanted to please us. I would return every week if it isn't 2000 miles away.//"

If you go here you are going for Gordon Ramsey not the food.  My risotto was under cooked and for a 65$ bowl of rice you think that would be down to perfection. I hope this helps you before you make a decision to go there.  I have had much much better food for 1/2 the price. \nP.S  Gordon  I think your show is GREAT!"

There is no proper side option to pair with the Tuna, it has no sides paired with it yet the other options do. I chose a few sides hoping to create a full meal of my main course but both were sub-par and odd with the fish course (as expected but as noted there were no proper options available). We have eaten at many of the Las Vegas top restaurants, many do not stand up to the local restaurants carefully managed by a head chef but this one was far below expectations for a chef famous for impeccable execution.  I suppose if we had ordered the sticky pudding we may have had something enjoyable to eat but after spending over $300 on items served cold we decided to have dessert elsewhere."

However, I tried a few bites of Ramsey's rib cap, and that, by far, is the best steak I've ever had. It's a shame they give you such a small cut for such a high price - I usually want to eat at least an 18oz steak if I'm paying more than $50 for it! But that aside, it was simply amazing. One of my favorite things this restaurant did was to present the uncooked steaks to us so we would know what we were ordering - the steaks they showed us were beautiful - I could stare at them forever!\n\nThe sides were also really good - the one that stood out to me was the bone marrow. Cooked to perfection. I tried the bone marrow at Wicked Spoon the day after and it was such a disappointment - could not compare. \n\nEverything that this restaurant served was delicious."

Everyone was so friendly and all smiles! They are also very helpful in explaining the menu and pointing out favorites. \n\nBread: so delicious! If only I had 10 stomachs, I would have kept asking for more! It was soft and warm and there was a whole bunch of different ones. And that butter!! It was so creamy, I almost wanted to put the whole butter one only one slice of bread, but I had to share :p\n\nKurobuta Pork Belly: delicious!  The meat was very juicy. The cheesy grits was awesome and it went really well together.\n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: it was my first time trying foie gras and I fell in love(Please don't send me hate mail animal lovers, i really didn't mean for it to be this way). The herbed goat cheese pop overs weren't for me, but if you like goat cheese you would love this. \n\nMac and cheese: very creamy. I usually don't like blue cheese in anything, but it was really good. Couldn't eat too much of it because it was filling.\n\nDemi bone marrow: please order with your steak you wouldn't regret!\n\nAmerican eye wrapped with Mangalista pork: most juiciest and greatest piece of steak I have ever had. I also had a piece of seared foie gras to go with it! The foie and the steak goes so well together. When I eat the foie with the steak, it was like eating a piece of butter with steak and you know butter is life! Haha I feel like all the other steaks I've ever had in my life was a joke! \n\nOverall, this place had made me one snobby steak eater. Steak back at home just ain't the same."

(Let's be honest, you don't order the Kurobuta Pork Belly if you're trying to go on a diet :p) \n\n2) Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with herbed goat cheese pop overs, gooseberry jus, pickled ramps\nPerfectly cooked as well - and the goat cheese popovers were to die for! \n\n3) Roasted Beef Wellington with glazed root vegetables, potato pur\u00e9e, red wine demi-glace\nIf you've ever watched Hells Kitchen, you'd know this is one seriously tough dish to cook and the two portions we ordered were so good, it didn't take long for our party to finish everything. \n\n4) American Wagyu Rib Cap 8 Oz - If the slightly fattier parts on the Rib Eye are your sort of thing and you're not a big eater, order this. It might look pricey on the menu and not look like much when they explain the different cuts available when compared to some other entrees but this was the star of the night for us. \n\n5) Bone-In Ribeye 24 Oz - Steak classic, done right. Clearly they know how to treat their meats right here! \n\nSides we ordered (I won't go into too much here other than to say these are good standard sides but given the portions here, maybe not necessary if you're a small to medium eater.) \n6) Mac & Cheese - blue, cheddar, parmesan, truffle\n7) Loaded Baked Potato - smoked gouda b\u00e9chamel,sour cream, bacon, chives\n\n8) Second crowd favorite of the evening: The sticky Toffee Pudding served with brown sugar toffee & brown butter ice cream\nBelieve me when I say NO ONE had any space for this but we all sucked it up and scraped up every last bit of pudding cake and ice cream as best we could. \n\nOverall a fantastic experience and a great way to start our Vegas trip this year, can't wait to go back again !"

            "review": "When reviewing any eatery of any sort, it is always important to manage expectations. For instance, you might've walked into a random dive that looked horrible and disgusting but ended up giving you above average food, which in turn might translate to 4 or even 5 stars. However, if a hyped-up steakhouse bearing the name of one of the most renowned chefs in the world were to give you anything but the finest cut of meat you've ever had, it's easy to immediately downgrade the count to 3 stars and furiously copy and paste the word \"overrated\" a couple hundred times. So when a restaurant like Gordon Ramsay Steak receives a 5 star rating, you can be assured that this place is definitely no joke.\n\nI usually start with food but the entire experience was so well thought out that I'll just start from the moment we entered the restaurant. We had a reservation for 5 at 7pm and they promptly took us to our table when we arrived. The young lady who guided us even gave us a quick little tour/explanation of the restaurant, detailing the designs and the thought behind the ambiance. A nice little touch that was duly noted.\n\nOur waiter immediately brought out an ipad menu that showed different alcoholic beverages they were serving and gave us a chance to look it over before taking our orders. I decided on a Southside which is their take on a mojito. It tasted absolutely refreshing and had a little more kick of mint flavor than other mojitos I've had but all in all, a solid drink. \n\nNext we were served three types of bread. One was some type of lemon focaccia, another was some sort of prosciutto roll, and the other I didn't try (sorry about the descriptions but I hadn't eaten all day in anticipation so my mind was pretty blurred by hunger). The roll was hands down the best one. It kind of looks like a cinammon roll and the prosciutto flavor came out really well; it almost had the flavoring of a chinese pork bun, but obviously a little more sophisticated and tastier. \n\nAnd to the main course we go. I really wanted to try both the beef wellington and the rib-eye so I ended up splitting with someone I was with. The beef wellington is his signature dish and it was absolutely perfect. The meat was sooo tender (all of them are cooked to medium-rare) and the puff pastry crust with the mushroom puree complimented the meat perfectly. I think there was also a hint of mustard somewhere in there but it wasn't strong at all and added a nice dimension to the steak. The rib-eye was also outstanding. Granted, I liked the wellington a lot so there is probably a marked mellowness in my enthusiasm for the rib-eye but I guess when you're eating two different steaks, one of them will stand out and inevitably cause the other one to take a backseat. However, to be fair, the rib-eye was riding shotgun and had one hand on the wheel. It was also cooked to a perfect medium rare and noticeably didn't have huge globs of fat hanging off the sides; the fat was well distributed throughout the meat so that it wasn't overbearing but still added that delicious lardy flavor we all crave in a good cut of steak :) This isn't a must but I saw bone-marrow on the menu and decided that I had to give it a try and let me tell you, it made the steak taste that much better. The bone marrow is pretty much just fat that you scoop out small portions and eat them with your steak. If it's in your budget, definitely give it a shot because it is well worth it.\n\nAt this point, your stomach is probably sending mad signals to your brain telling you to stop eating, that dessert is out of the question. This is the time when you must concentrate, dig deep, and order the sticky toffee pudding. There is really no description better suited for this dessert than an orgasm in your mouth. It comes with a toffee sauce they pour onto the pudding which just melts in your mouth and a side of butter ice cream (it literally looks like a stick of butter). You will not regret this.\n\nI must say that this is quite the premier steakhouse. Granted, we did run into a couple slips ups. Our waiter, for one, would disappear for prolonged periods of time and if it weren't for the sheer number of waiters passing our table, I probably would've docked at least half a star. Also, make sure to specify that you want tap water. Our waiter gave us this glass jar of water and charged us for it, even though we had simply asked for 5 glasses of water. I guess I didn't specify what type of water I wanted but let's be honest, if you see 5 marginally employed college grads, you think they want to pay $18 for water? But when all was said and done,this was reflected in the waiter's tip and more importantly, I don't want one waiter to take anything away from the rest of this amazing experience. I generally hate giving out 5 star reviews but the amazing food coupled with the chill, hip atmosphere they got going on forced my hand. Just be sure to hit the tables afterwards so you can restock your wallet (or go broke)."

So, I guess it was not unusual for me to fly 2000 miles West just to eat at Gordon Ramsay Steak to check out the place and see how Christina (winner of Hell's Kitchen 2012) was doing as the new chef.  THAT was my only purpose in making the trip.\n\nI had a reservation for one at 7:15pm and was promptly taken through the entrance that resembled the London Tube.  On my way to the table, the hostess explained the oddly shaped light in the middle of the main room (no spoiler alert here) and seated me at a great table where I could view the open kitchen.  Whew, those folks work hard.  I guess they don't want GR to yell at them.\n\nAnyway, my server (Matthew) arrived with iPad in had to show me the wine and drink selections.  I am sure it was bad enough for him to see that he had to wait on a \"single\" but when he learned that the single did not drink, he must have thought he had really drawn the short straw.  However, he never showed it all night long.  He was assisted by another server and the two of them did a great job of treating me like a king all night long.  Like all GR restaurants, during the meal you are severed by many other in addition to your \"main\" servers.\n\nThis is a steak place and they brought out the selection of steaks in a most interesting way.  It is best described by saying you have to see it to understand it, but the steak selections were on a cart shaped like a wheel.  I was very easy to see all of the steaks and Matthew did a great job of explaining all of them to me.  There are MANY other things on the menu from seafood to chicken, but steak is the centerpiece of this place.\n\nI went with the beef wellington.  I also had the fried oysters.  They were garnished with creame fraiche.  Outstanding.  That was followed by a wonderful caesar salad which was garnished with a scotch egg.  Then came the steak.  It was prepared to perfection along with root veggies and potato puree.  I also order a side of brussel sprouts (don't turn your nose up until you try them).  EVERYTHING I ate was off the charts wonderful.\n\nHowever, as others have written here, the star of the night was the sticky toffee pudding.  Holy Smoke!  It was the best dessert I have EVER had.  It is served with ice cream that is on the plate and shaped like a whole stick of butter.\n\nI thought the prices were fine and the value was outstanding.  If you go to Vegas, make this a stop before you drop all you money at the tables or on a show.  THIS will be the \"event\" you'll be talking about when you get home!"

I had a couple of qualms about this place before entering the facility. When my boyfriend made the reservation all he had to leave was a name, the hostess did not ask for a phone number. We pondered if we should call them back to leave a phone number so they could confirm the reservation with us day of, we decided not to. On the day of, my boyfriend called them to confirm the reservation. He said the girl sounded like they were making a new one for us and only replied with okay then hung up. After that he told me to call them back to confirm the reservation since it seemed like none of us were on the right page. I called back, told them the name under the reservation and then I was asked to hold. I held for 10 minutes before I decided to hang up. A restaurant boasting renowned Chef Gordon Ramsay's name should be much more organized than this I thought. If the reservations was screwed up for that night, I told myself I'd rip them a new one.\n\nLuckily, no new ones were ripped. The reservation was set already but the lack of communication was absurd. Ladies dressed in all black attire opened the vault like door to enter. We sat at the bar for a bit, I ordered a midori sour and my boyfriend got a coke and rum. After a couple minutes, we were notified that our seats were ready. I got a bit flustered because we were still trying to pay for our drink tab and the girl didn't bother to help us grab our drinks, with which I am not accustomed to. We got to our seat and our waiter came over quickly to give us water and show us a special prix fixe menu. He told us that the menu is a souvenir to take home at the end of the night should we choose to select it. We both rejected the offer and ended up getting the foie gras and beef wellington.\n\nThe foie gras was very delicious and enjoyable, the beef wellington... ehhh. Like I said, I already had some qualms that it was going to be disappointing. The pastry crust was nice but it tasted a bit off with the meat. After dinner, we got the melon panna cotta. I enjoyed the watermelon sorbet.\n\nOur server was very nice and explained all the different cuts of meat they had. It was a bit hard to hear him over the loud bang of music.

Tony M was my partner in culinary crime when we ate here last time. It was like Deja Vu all over again. We had the same bartender Alan from our last dinning experience. Alan was great & we had an instant rapport with him. He even said he remembered us which I believe because we have this effect on Vegas bartenders but that's another story. \n\nWe decided to order the Kurobuta Pork Belly because we loved it so much when we had eaten it here before. The dish did not let us down. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and was incredibly tasty. The worse part of it was that we had to split it. It also came garnished with cheesy grits which are the best grits I've ever had. Grits are one of those dishes I usually don't go crazy for but this version has me going goo-goo. It must be the cheese. The dish was finished off with tomato jam and onion pork jus. The flavors worked so well together, in fact I want a bowl of jam & jus. I would totally pour it on everything. \n\nI almost forgot about the complimentary fresh baked breads. These are really good and come with butter that has been sprinkled with volcano salt. I didn't know you could get salt from a volcano but if anyone can it would be Chef Ramsey. Come on man! He's the man from Hell's Kitchen and he ain't afraid of no Volcano. \n\nWe also ordered a nice bottle of red which was brought over by the sommelier. This is a little foreshadowing that we were going to order steak. This place is called Steak and not Seafood. As My buddy Tony M would say, \"You can't order fish in a desert!\", which makes complete sense. \n\nWe also ordered the Caesar Salad with Parmesan cheese, garlic croutons & a tiny Scotch egg. Alan suggested he could have the kitchen split the salad for us which was a nice touch. The Scotch egg was the smallest one I've ever seen. I'm sure it was a quail egg or something. The salad was made with romaine hearts & the dressing was perfect. I know it's just a salad but it's special when it comes out of Gordon's kitchen. \n\nNow it came to ordering our meat. Last time I was here I had the bone in rib eye which was really good. It is a huge piece of meat. You will feel like Fred Flintstone if you pick it up by the bone &!start eating it. It was getting close to 11pm and I was thinking my body didn't want 24oz of meat this late. Alan our bartender highly recommended I go with the American Wagyu Rib Cap. I had never heard of the Rib Cap. Apparently it is a part of the cow that doesn't get used that much which makes it real tender. I decided to go for it & loved that it was only 8oz. I must admit it was very tender. I ordered it medium rare & the chef cooked it perfectly. I don't like my meat killed twice so it was great I didn't have to go all Ramsey on someone. Somewhere Gordon is smiling about a job well done. My friend Tony M ordered the bone in rib eye. He gave me a little piece & I was able to compare them. Now I feel like Alan the bartender when I say this...\"You must order the American Wagyu Rib Cap!\" Now don't get me wrong the Bone in rib eye was fantastic but when sitting next to the American Wagyu Rib Cap in a taste comparison. The American Wagyu Rib Cap wins hands down. It was tender, tasty and full of flavor. It was everything a steak should be & more. I am so glad I tried it & I can't wait to order it again on my next trip here. \n\nWhat is a steak without sides? So we decided to order the Potato Pur\u00e9e which contains Yukon gold potato & Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and an order of the Saut\u00e9ed spinach. The spinach can also be prepared creamy but Alan talked us out of it. The saut\u00e9ed spinach was very simple with garlic and olive oil. It was definitely a perfect healthy side dish. I really loved the potato pur\u00e9e. I believe these are the same potatoes he makes on the TV show. I can imagine Gordon tasting them with a spoon and saying, \"Try that!\" Then I would say, \"It's a little salty!\" He would say, \"Bloody Right!\" And the he would fling the dish across the room. It was fun to taste a dish that I've seen the contestants make for years on his TV show. \n\nGordon Ramsey Steak is everything I would expect from Gordon. The restaurant is elegant & classy. The food is top notch & expensive. This place is a shinning gem in a sea of popular celebrity Vegas restaurants. Chef Ramsey should be proud to have his name on the front door. In the words of Chef, \"Now Get Out! The Review Is Over!\""

We did not have reservations, but were still seated immediately. The inside of the place is incredibly well designed (a modern version of rustic elegance), we found ourselves at several moments throughout the dinner stopping our conversation as our eyes would catch random decorative features that we enjoyed. The servers, hosts, and management were all friendly and attentive (comparable to other experiences at similarly priced/rated restaurants in Las Vegas, nothing mind blowing there). Our favorite part of the evening was by far the drinks from the bar. We had a Pimm's soda and an \"HK Antioxidant.\" The food, sadly, was incredibly disappointing all around. In total we ordered: caesar salad, tomato heirloom salad, shrimp cocktail, gnocchi, and the beef wellington. You have to order the beef wellington at GR's restaurant right? Maybe we should have followed our stomachs and gone with the incredible looking steak cart instead of following our brains to the wellington...Anyway, the food was all incredibly bland. The wellington especially had no specific flavor and the gnocchi had an incredibly bland/uneventful sauce. For the name, I'd expect a lot more than this, for the price, I definitely better get a lot better quality. I'd come back here and enjoy a drink at the bar, but definitely wouldn't return for the food."

The sticky toffee pudding was the best of any desserts I have ever tried anywhere. My husband got the cheesecake. \nWe plan on going back on July 5th for our anniversary and ask for Matthew to be our server. As this was far the best food and the best service anyone could ask for.

This is another must stop whenever I am in Vegas. All I can say is WOW. started out with a Shellfish Platter for 5. I am not into seafood but the rest of my party could not stop talking about it. It contained tiger prawns, king crab, oysters, clams, lobster, and other shellfish served with champagne mignonette, citrus soy sauce, cocktail sauce. This went well with a couple of cocktails, beer, and a green tea for my daughter.  \n\nThen the main course.  My buddies wife ordered the Pacific Salmon while my wife ordered the American Eye cooked at a medium. Bothe the Salmon and Eye were cooked perfectly.  My daughter ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast with multigrain pilaf, crispy skin dumplings, limoncello jus. The chicken was juicy and she loved the pilaf. My buddy and I both ordered the 24 oz Bone-In Rib Eye. Both at a Medium Well. AWESOME. The best steak I have ever eaten. All steaks are aged for at least 28 days at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The sear was perfect. The temp was perfect. The seasoning was perfect. Could not ask for a better steak. \n\nSides do not come with the main course at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  But an order of grilled carrots and a loaded baked potato filled the plate. The potato had a taste that I could not put my finger on, but tasted awesome. I later found out that it contained smoked gouda b\u00e9chamel,sour cream, bacon, chives. It was pretty damn good. \n\nWe were so stuffed. But I could not pass up dessert.  I had to order, after all how many times will I get the chance. I ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was a sweet pudding cake with brown sugar toffee and brown butter ice cream. The ice cream tasted like coffee. Awesome. \n\nCan not afford to eat hear often. You wallet takes a hit. Lol. But I will be back.  Freakin awesome."

Luckily we even noticed.  I wonder how often that happens to unsuspecting diners? \n- We were 5 adults, with a reservation made well in advance, who spent almost $700 on dinner alone (and that doesn't include any expensive wine BTW), yet we were crammed into a 4-top table.  $140/per person plus tip and we can't get a table big enough for everyone?  Seriously???  \n- 25 minute wait for a table despite reservation.  Plenty of time to order $50 in drinks though.\n- Crap service - 25 mins waiting for a table, bus boy broke a water glass, 5 people crammed into a 4-person table, waiter accidentally charged us for a $45 cook book we never ordered, one of our party was having a birthday.  You'd think we'd at least have had a free desert or something but nope.\n- Gordon Ramsey is everywhere.  There's even a whole page picture of him in the friggin' menu. How narcissistic can you be? \n- Overall it was a very \"Vegas\" experience.  I felt like I needed a shower after dinner ... and not in a good way ... after being upsold, slimed and scammed for 3 hours.  \n- Expensive ... yes.  Classy ... not in the least.\n\nBottom line ... if you thought Gordon Ramsey was a pretentious idiot after watching his TV show then eating at Steak makes him seem 100 times worse."

            "review": "Maybe it's because I'm obsessed with Ramsay's shows and had such high hopes for this place, but the restaurant certainly did not meet expectations.  After hearing Ramsay go off on so many of his shows and watching how critical these TV food stars can be, I wondered if their own restaurants would be as perfect.  I guess not everyone practices what they preach.  But with all that said, I can see how the restaurant CAN appeal to a certain crowd.\n\nFirst impressions (2 stars):\nThe hostesses (more like college-age to girls in their 20s) at the front are dressed in short black leather tube tops and are definitely not trained to offer the perfect, proper greeting.  It felt more like I was about to enter a strip club or a hooters.  That's a minus for me since I had a completely different picture of Gordon Ramsay Steak in mind.  For the guys out there, I guess it might be a plus.\n\nAtmosphere (2 stars):\nIt was nice that as you're seated, the hostess explains the concept behind one of the art pieces/logos at the restaurant: lights illuminating Ramsay's motions as he prepares his signature beef wellington.  But again, the ambiance was more befitting of a party lounge.  Not at all classy.\n\nFood (3.5 stars):\nBread was okay.  There were some unique ones, but I didn't really like the pancetta bread - didn't taste fresh.  The clams appetizer were AMAZING - worthy of 4 stars.  Of course, I had to have his signature beef wellington - delicious, but not worth going back for.\n\nService (3.5 stars):\nThe waiters (thankfully they weren't wearing leather jeans or tight tops) were very professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  They also go to extra mile to answer any questions you might have. \n\nOverall, this place just wasn't my cup of tea.   Want loud music, booze, girls in tube tops, with a side of good food?  This is certainly your place to dine.  But, it's definitely not an elegant dining experience.  Then again, I am on the Strip in Las Vegas and not Royal Hospital Road in London."

            "review": "I took a deep breath before I began writing this review. This is one I don't want to write, but feel the need and urgency to share despite other people's great ol' reviews about this place. This dinner was supposed to be special. We were celebrating our best friend's wedding (so you can imagine my anger) and wanted this dinner to be phenomenal and unforgettable, especially for her. We wanted the steaks to melt in our mouths. We wanted to dream about the meal even after we fly home. Unfortunately, it was unforgettable but in the worst way possible. With it being a celebration and congratulatory dinner and all, we felt insulted to be served what we were served. We were so so so disappointed.\n\nNow, to dive into our experience that night...our party started off with the shellfish platter. This was good, but it's very hard to mess up seafood as long as they are fresh. The platter consisted of king crab, oysters, lobster, and shrimp. The sauces were interesting. Some were good, some were insignificant. They also had a small cup of mussel and scallop ceviche. I believe one of the sauces was uni sauce, but it was very much watered down so it didn't feel like a sauce to me. Nice start but once again, not hard to mess up seafood if it's fresh and raw. There is no cooking involved.\n\nTheir bread choices were okay, just bread. Only the brioche was good, the others were not. I actually find it amusing when I read that people think their bread is amazing or really good. It's just bread. I get the brioche one because there was something more to it. The others were just plain.\n\nDrinks: Strawberry Martini (gin, strawberries, lemon) and Southside (champagne, gin, lime, mint). They were alright.  \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Royal Long-Bone Chop, American Wagyu American Eye with Mangalitsa pork, and Roasted Beef Wellington. Two of us took a bite of the Royal and wow...it was BURNT. This was not the charred kind that belongs on a steak. This was black and burnt. The kind when you bite into it and black burnt crumbs fall apart and leaves your mouth with the bitter, disgusting aftertaste that lasts throughout the night. That kind of burnt. We talked to our server. I asked him to take a closer look at it and asked him if he would eat that himself. He touched it and the black crumbs fell apart on the plate and blackened his fingertips...I looked at him with his widened eyes and speechless reaction. He replied that it was too burnt for his taste. Ok so it wasn't just us. It was clearly beyond scorched. Next up, we tried the famous, raved about Beef Wellington. Man oh man. I really, really wanted to like it. We were waiting to try this one dish. I was SO disappointed! If you were there with us, you could just feel the emotional disappointment going around the table. We know this dish, it's THE signature dish, this was the reason we made the reservation at the restaurant...but alas it was nothing special. The pastry was soggy. The whole thing fell apart for me. I ate the steak part first, which had no flavor, then I picked up the soggy pastry part with my fork and ate it separately. Honestly, I couldn't even tell it was the pastry at that point, it was just a wet, soggy broken layer of dough. Lastly, we ate the Wagyu American Eye. Once again, it was burnt, incredibly dry and burnt, texture was hard and tough too even though it was medium rare. When it's that burnt, you cannot even taste the flavor of the meat, just bitter taste in your mouth. Our friend asked the server if all the steaks were supposed to be like this. The server couldn't even answer, but we knew the answer. It didn't even look like it was going to be tender/flavorful. It was a small, black, burnt piece of meat on a giant, white, clean plate. This one steak was supposed to have a bacon wrapped around it. If you look at my pictures, you can see the black burnt piece of layer around it. The flash on my camera made it look prettier than it really was so props to my camera. I asked the server if the burnt piece of black layer was the bacon. He was speechless. He too could see that it didn't even look appetizing, nor safe. How can they serve this to us? We felt insulted that they would bring these dishes out on a plate and expect us to eat them. I still remember the bitter burnt taste from the first bite, there is no way that is edible. Nobody can eat that. It's so bad for you. Most importantly, it was our friend's wedding dinner and we waited weeks for this, for her. Because of this, they are undeserving of a compliment.\n\nNobody likes to go to an upscale restaurant, be served bad food, then complain about it. That's just not how it works. In fact, I hate having to write this review. When you experience something as awful as this on a very special day, it has to be shared and made aware of. I only hope that nobody else will have as awful of an experience as we did. It's so inequitable, especially when you are willing to pay such high prices for the food AND water."

For our appetizers we decided on the Seared Fois Gras and the Kurobuta Pork Belly. Please note the appetizer portions are small, but they're not extremely small. The fois gras was fairly tasty, although some parts were a bit too squishy for my preference. The pistachio streusel and jam that are served on the plate with it were very rich, a little too sweet for my liking but overall pretty darn good. This was the first time I've ever eaten Fois Gras, it was definitely a unique taste, and I could see it offputting to most, but I'd order it again (if it were seared a bit more). As for the pork belly, that was really good. Best Pork Belly I have had. \n\nNow as a side note, they bring out these bread rolls to you. I believe 6 different types? Wow, these were excellent, and the one with bacon baked in to it? Give Gordon Ramsay the Nobel Peace prize. That was just incredibly delicious. Why have I never had bread with bacon baked into it before? I was in heaven, I requested more, yummy!\n\nAs for the dinner, I decided to go with their signature Beef Wellington and my sister had the 24 oz Bone in rib eye. This is where I was a bit upset, and the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars despite their bread being phenomenal, their pork belly being the bets pork belly I've ever had, and the dessert, OMG, that'll come later.... The Beef wellington comes one way and one way only, medium rare, that's fine, thats how I enjoy my steaks. My waiter told me it's served this way because if it cooked anymore the pastry would get burned. Anyhow, when I received my wellington I was really excited but at first bite I was quite saddened. The pastry was already a bit soggy, the beef texture just didn't seem right, although it was very soft, and the red wine demi glace just did not taste good at all. I pretty much avoided it completely. I had some of my sister's bone in rib eye, boy oh boy did it have a ton of fat on it, not trimmed properly at all... I would expect better trimming from a restaurant of this caliber. She additionally tried their signature steak sauce, which was just terrible. The steak tasted alright, but not any better than a regular ol' steakhouse down the road. \n\nAnyhow, onto my dessert. We were stuffed and really didn't want dessert but the waiter said \"If you don't like it, be honest, and it's on the house\" so how could I resist? Which dessert did he suggest you ask? Three words.... Sticky Toffee Pudding! It came out, and to be honest the look doesn't do it justice. It just kind of looks like a warm cake, some sauce in the middle and an ice cream bar molded into the form of a stick of butter with a knife thru it... But wow, once you pour the sauce over the cake, and then combine the brown butter ice cream with it... Well, you've got the world's greatest dessert hands down. I have never in my life had a tastier dessert and my sister agreed. This was just outstanding. I'd go here just to order the dessert.\n\nAs for the service, A+. The waiter was very knowledgeable on all their food items, my water was always full, and I drink a ton of water. My only suggestion is to get rid of the multitude of bimbos at the hostess stand. There were 3-4 of them standing there when I arrived, and they all seemed confused."

Drinks were perfect.  Scallop risotto was to die for.  Also had the beef Wellington and shared the rib cap.  Both excellent to try but think I will stick with the ribeye.  Best of all was the sticky toffee pudding.  A must order.  Great experience for a long dinner and one time experience.  Made for a great birthday."

Extremely tender, done medium rare as I wanted it, and also got a side of mashed potato puree which complemented the steak perfectly. Our wine enthusiast picked out a bottle of 08 Embruix, Priorat which was fairly nice though a bit spicy for me. Distilled water comes in 9$ bottles, we didn't know that when we arrived so if you don't want to pay for water just ask for ice water (they only ask if you want distilled or sparkling). Hells kitchen tasting menu is also available for a limited time, its 145$ for 5 courses and an autographed photo of Ramsay and 75$ more for wine paring on this."

I joke, but as a restaurant owned by someone who screams at people who run crappy restaurants, I expected this to be out of this world. Alas, it was decent, but not worth the money.\n\nI met some friends in Vegas and one really wanted to visit Gordon Ramsay Steak. He got a last minute reservation when the restaurant opened at 4:30pm and when we arrived the host told us to wait in a line 50 people deep. I was astounded how many people were there already and the size of the line but I was even more amazed at how quickly the line moved and how fast everyone was ushered to their tables. The triumph of Las Vegas is in it's logistics more than anything else.\n\nWe were seated upstairs in a nice half circle booth that looked out over the restaurant. The atmosphere was dark, swanky and cool like you'd expect from a traditional steakhouse. Gordon Ramsay's name is everywhere: napkins, placemat, menu, etc. Maybe Gordon thinks you'll forget where you're eating. I didn't.\n\nThe waitstaff was a strange set up. We had two servers that appeared to form a server caste system, one in a suit, and one with a blue shirt and a weird apron pinned to the top button of the shirt and forming a triangle down to the waist. There were many presentations. First, we were given the beverages iPad. It was nearly impossible to find any wine because the list was so large. I like using an iPad for a menu, but this was ridiculously difficult to use. Second, we got the prix fixe menu. For $145 (and an extra $130 for a beverage pairing) you get all of GR's signature dishes like beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding. If you order the prix fixe you get a signed picture of Gordon himself, but the whole table must participate. Next, we got the regular menu. Finally, the server brought out a wheel of meat, a cart that displays 10 cuts of meat available on the menu and the server discusses each one.\n\nWe started with kobe sliders, oysters, and foie gras appetizers. The foie was incredible and one of the best foie dishes I've ever had. I normally wouldn't get oysters in the desert but they were fine. For dinner, three of us got the beef wellington. The beau and I shared truffle macaroni and cheese and creamed spinach. Both of the sides were ok, but nothing I haven't had better elsewhere. The beef wellington was tender and juicy wrapped in prosciutto, covered in a mushroom duxelles then baked in a pastry. The prosciutto did not complement the dish at all. The flavors in my mouth: bologna sandwich with mustard and miracle whip. I'm not joking. I don't know why but when I closed my eyes, that's what I tasted. Gordon Ramsay's secret weapon may be Miracle Whip. You read it here first.\n\nI've had good and bad food in Las Vegas. This falls squarely in the middle. I don't understand why the Paris Casino and Resort would have a steakhouse with a British chef. If you want to spend a lot of money on a meal, there are plenty of beautiful places where you also can have a window to the outside. This place wasn't terrible, but I'm not rushing to go back either."

It was also the night I got married to the love of my life. \n\nTim (my husband) and I had been wanting to eat at Gordon Ramsay steak for years now, but never had the opportunity to drop that kind of cash on a single meal, so being able to celebrate for our wedding was a dream come true. \n\nNeedless to say our expectations were naturally high, and those expectations were happily surpassed. \n\nWe were about 30 minutes late for our reservation, but we're still sat right upon arrival. We were soon greeted by our waiter and he had with him the drink iPad which was fun to flip through. We opted for the normal spring water vs bottled and were poured right away. As I went to take a sip of water I noticed a fruit fly. I asked for a fresh water and was poured one with a new glass in impeccable time. Even after being poured a fresh glass the general manager, Michael Honea, came to our table and offered his sincere apologies. We were then treated with bottled water for the entirety of our meal as well as a celebratory dessert on the house. To tell you the truth I was already happy with the quickness of the staff who poured the fresh water that the GM coming over and chatting was really above and beyond. I was very impressed. \n\nNext came the food. We ordered scallops for apps, beef Wellington and street corn for entree, and had the sticky toffee dessert (compliments of the house). The scallop was tender and succulent, very delicious. The Wellington did not disappoint, if I had to make one critique it would be that the puff pastry was slightly overdone, definitely not a deal breaker though, and if I would have asked for a new one I am 100% sure they would have gladly brought one out. The dessert was good, not anything exceptional in my point of view, but a good solid dessert and a great way to end the meal. We weren't planning on ordering dessert because we had the wedding cake back in our hotel room, but I'm glad I was able to try it. \n\nAside from the food I must say that the service was impeccable. Every time my husband used the restroom someone came and folded his napkin and prepared his space for a fresh return. Our settings were wiped and reset after every course. \n\nThis couldn't have been a better place to eat our post wedding meal. I felt like a princess all day and that didn't end once we were sat here. \n\nThank you so much Gordon Ramsay Steak for being such a shining star in our wonderful wedding memories, to say we appreciate it would be an understatement. I can't wait to come back each year for our anniversary"

This was simple enough to do and it is a nice touch. For appetizers my wife ordered shrimp cocktail which was very good. It came with a sauce that was different than classic cocktail sauce but tasted just like it. I ordered the pork belly appetizer and it was insanely delicious! For main entree the wife ordered Kobe skirt steak which was delicious. I ordered the beef wellington and it was excellent. We also share the truffle mac and cheese and it was full of truffle flavor and totally outrageous! We ordered the toffee pudding desert and it is off the charts fantastic and a must try!

Being that I am fortunate enough to eat at so many great places, I don't always feel the need to pass on my experiences about all of them. This place deserves it though. I've worked many openings for restaurants and hotels and I know the rate of things that go wrong. None of that happened here. From the design of the restaurant, to the service and the food, all was blissful. \nFirst off, I noticed the obvious symbolism of the tube shaped entrance and bar in the lounge which was the the Metro or the Chunnel connecting London to Paris. In this case, London being the restaurant and of course the Paris hotel. Thankfully, the food was not traditional English lol.\nService was right on point; never an empty water glass, and a slew of servers tending to your needs. I noticed the meat cart early on and when it came around I was surprised to learn that it was the actual cut of meat you can choose from. Not a fake plastic or wax model...the actual cut of meat. The mirrors behind each cut to showcase the marbling and the quality were a nice touch. Certainly something I had never seen before.\nI couldn't begin to tell you everything we ate because we had a ridiculous amount of dishes for two people. What I DO remember is why you would have to go there in the first place. The strawberry martini was perfect, gin, strawberry and lemon. Just enough to feel good, not too sweet that it tasted fake.\nOf all the appetizers and starter, the roasted beet salad was so flavorful and beautifully presented that I swore I was done with dinner and could eat just that every day for the rest of my life. The Asparagus soup had such a phenomenal blend of interesting tastes and textures that it is hard to believe it came from such a childhood favorite vegetable (joke) that nevermind how it makes your pee smell. \nSkip the Yellow fin tuna, it was pretty blah compared to the scores of other places that do it so well...sorry.\nThe meats were cooked perfectly and though I like a good lean meat, I had the New York over the filet and it was perfect, as was the big boy long bone chop, from which my dog received a bone nearly as long as him!\nSince steaks can be so straightforward, I would mention some of the sides. The mac and cheese, which has become a staple at most steakhouses now, very tasty, the haricot verts, perfectly crispy,and the fire roasted corn, for those in the know, was reminiscent of Mexican street corn found in downtown L.A. being roasted and served out of a makeshift shopping cart turned bbq grill topped with lime, hot spices, and mayonnaise...mucho yummy. I'm sure they do this somewhere in Mexico as well ;-).\nNow after falling in and out of a food coma, and two bottles of wine later, we were literally served every single dessert on the menu. So I can't name them all but I will tell you to trust the server when he says their specialty toffee pudding cake was worth breaking the so-called diet for and will be worth a return visit. But don't just take my word for everything, go see for yourself! Make a reservation, they sill seem to be pretty busy!"

Having seen customers rave about the food on Hell's Kitchen I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Tasting menu. Although the service was excellent with one small hiccup the food experience did not live up to expectations. The scotch egg and heirloom tomato salad fell flat. The pea risotto with scallop was saved by a perfectly cooked scallop. The biggest disappointment by far was the beef wellington. Although the flavor was good the presence of silver skin made it unappetizing. Our waiter simply noted the sometimes a tendon is present in the meat but took no other action which accounted for the small hiccup in service. By far the highlights of the meal were the wine pairings and dessert. The wine pairings compensated for all the short comings of the meal. They were perfection. The toffee pudding dessert with brown butter ice cream was insanely delicious. For a brief second it made me dismiss the deficiencies of the rest of the meal. I have not been to any other Gordon Ramsay restaurants but fine dining is my pastime including the occasional Michelin Starred restaurant so I would be surprised if my experience would have lived up to Gordon Ramsay's standards."

Our son who is 11 was extremely sad to know he was not able to join us as he too is a huge fan of Gordon's! I do not think we will tarnish his opinion by telling him about our experience:(.  We were there Monday September 9, 2013.  The whole experience was over priced, undercooked and bland.  I read someone review from the same night that had over seasoned food, sorry I almost wish that happened to us!\n\nI actually wanted to eat from the Hells Kitchen tasting menu but was told NO unless everyone at the table ordered it.  The problem was that we were there with friends that do not eat meat.  Sadly I was not able to order what I wanted. As we were also told that we could only order the wellington medium and not well done.\n\nNext we were told the wild pacific salmon was actually farm raised and not wild.\n\nOur drink orders were fine.\n\nApps were mixed, my onion soup was average, gnocchi was sad and under seasoned, the pea soup was okay, and the Seared Foie Gras was not seared well and under seasoned:(.\n\nMoving on to Entrees...  Our Friends both had seafood and pork.  The chops were underwhelming and my friend had better at Delmonico's.  The fishermans grill was tasty but worth half what she received.  As for my husband and myself we were sad about the experience with both the Beef Wellington which was soggy and extremely rare.  We were told we could not order it well, and all of them came out medium.  My husbands plate was bloody and unappealing to look at.  A huge MISS!  I actually ordered the pork belly which tasted okay but bland and was full of fat.  I mean loads of fat, even for the small portion I received.  The portions and the price may have been worth it had our food of been seasoned and cooked.  My husband and I joked that if Gordon were actually eating this meal he would have been disgusted and thrown it all in the trash.  We also had sides of: mac n cheese (again very bland and over cooked), Haricot Vert which was okay, Roasted heirloom carrots, okay, creamed spinach was good but same as you could get anywhere.\n\nOur table was too small for the four of us and our wait staff did not seem happy to be there.  While they had smiles on their faces they were not familiar with the menu and unable to answer many questions.  Maybe they were annoyed because we were foodies and asked a lot of questions! I just do not know.  The actual assistant buser to our waiter was friendly but again not very knowledgeable.  \n\nThe ONLY thing we had that was worth going there was the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING!!!  Best Thing I have EVER TASTED!!!  I wish I had order only that!  As I would have been completely satisfied and had no need to be disappointed by the $500 plus we spent on the remainder of the food.  Overall I am glad we went, but so disappointed I cannot imagine ever going to one of his restaurants again unless he is there.  Crazy enough we were told he had been there two days before we were.  I wish I knew before we made the reservations for Monday."

Thor heirloom salad I got was excellent and the Maine lobster appetizer for my girl was good.\nThen came the dinner.....\nWhen you work in the restaurant industry, especially at a higher level, you expect certain basics to flow through the staff from top to bottom.\nSo, we ordered, Lobster Wellington and American filet with a few sides..( carrots...Lobster Mac...fingerling potatoes..)\nTo be served in a high end restaurant you expect and deserve professional service. What we received was sad.\nOur lead server was non existent throughout the meal unless we wanted to order more...his back up server, although pleasant was almost useless.... when I had a problem with my meal he said sorry and after many minutes our lead server arrived.\nOur entrees arrived....then our drive by no explanation sides arrived.\nDrop plates on the table...do not explain the dishes and walk away within 10 seconds! What kind of service is this?\nI would like to say there is nothing worse than drive by waiters, but....\nIn a high end steak house, should you ever ever get an undercooked steak?\nSadly, yes I like a med well steak and I said to the rather poor server that yes I know it's an American filet ( $72 ) and I'm quite happy for some char on the outside to have it cooked how I like, but it came out medium red!\nGordon Ramsey Steak! What?\nHow can the server, chef, food runner all serve an entree so incorrectly? \nManagers table checking? No. not once.\nWe also ordered some deserts which were very pleasant.\nThere are many many choices for excellent steaks in Vegas, but I would have to say we will not return to Gordon Ramsey Steak again! Cut, Jean Georges, SW Steakhouse, even Ruth's Chris offer far better service and meats, and after dropping a few hundred you leave feeling a great dinner and great experience were well worth the money."

The service was (English Accent) spot on! I loved how they displayed the meat on this fancy tray. I ordered the beef Wellington (I see it being cooked on Hell's Kitchen all the time) and my fiance ordered the 8oz fillet. We also ordered a side of asparagus and mac n cheese. Everything was cooked to perfection and this was one of the top two restaurants I've been to (See my Girl and the Fig review for Sonoma, Ca). The food is pricey....but you expect that.\n\nP.S. I'm not a fan of coffee but I tried theirs.....AMAZING! They bring the sugar cubes along with spoonfuls of Amaretto, Bailey's chocolate and Chamborg (sp?). I gobbled it down!"

As mentioned by many other Yelpers, you enter through a \"tube\" (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6uhas67fyLO3rEi1f1VMNw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg) that \"transports you from Paris to London.\" Sounded kitschy to me at first but is actually more tastefully done than I initially expected. The dining area itself is a huge two-story dining room with large red neon artwork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XbS7ww57AwhWY9VhmdPCsw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg) at the center of the ceiling, which the hostess pointed out as she seated us. It is an artist's interpretation of Gordon Ramsay's hand movements while making his signature dish: the Beef Wellington of Hell's Kitchen fame. Ambient lights are attached to a wire that runs across the walls. Music is a bit on the louder side, definitely not the typical stuffy place designed for hushed tones and mousey eating.\nSERVICE: Our server checked up on us frequently and filled up our waters often, but rightfully seemed a bit like she was anxious to go home by the end of the night. (We were one of the last people to leave)\nCHANCE OF RETURNING: 60%\n___________________________________\n\n[ ACTUAL RATING: 3.5* ]\n\nThis place, like so many of Gordon Ramsay's newer restaurants since I last went to Maze in New York, is clearly catered towards his Hell's Kitchen fan base. They even have a \"Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu.\" Seriously. Kudos to the growing empire for capitalizing on the media-inspired fame as well as they have.\n\nThe meal was definitely good - not quite mind blowing (don't expect something comparable to a Michelin-starred restaurant) but definitely a decent steakhouse. If there weren't so many places still on my list of destinations in Vegas, my chances of returning might be closer to 70%.\n\nThe wine and cocktail menu is available on an iPad, like that at Charlie Palmer's Aureole.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of our meal we had no space at all for dessert. I might be back sometime before the end of this trip to try the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING at the bar, which consists of a sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, and brown butter ice cream.\n\nTIP: If you don't already have a Total Rewards card, get one. It only shaves $1-$3 per dish but that's money you can allocate towards a higher gratuity for your hard-working servers! ;-)\n\n___________________________________\n\n:::: [ THE FOOD ] ::::\n\n* BREAD TRAY\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Pvi2lZcSgkHc0gEiaEpw7w&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [4/5 - We were served with 6 kinds of room temperature bread including a pancetta brioche, black truffle brioche, and blue cheese and walnut bread. On the side was a somewhat cold imported butter. My favorite hands down was the black truffle brioche, though the blue cheese and walnut bread was also pretty good. I couldn't really taste the pancetta in the pancetta brioche, which I was actually most excited about when the tray arrived at our table.]\n* SEARED FOIE GRAS - $25 \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QytfTD2Hpp1yWcvuV30xiQ&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3.75/5 - Perfectly seared creamy foie gras, delicious huckleberry, and marcona almonds. This is nowhere near the top 10 foie gras dishes I've tried, but that's coming from someone who actively seeks both Michelin-starred as well as regular mid-range restaurants who fellow Yelpers claim serve great foie gras. Be sure to use every drop of the sauce on the plate or you will find your foie gras disappointingly bland.]\n* ROASTED BEEF WELLINGTON FOR 2 - $100\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7sjGYKbej_1IkprjvGR1Sw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3.75/5 - Served with a red wine demi glace, potato puree, and glazed root vegetables. The pastry portion of the beef wellington seems to be where all of the sodium is allocated, so be sure to portion your bites of meat with enough of it or you won't have even distribution of seasoning. The glazed root vegetables seems like an afterthought. Coming from someone who loves purees and generally soft, creamy, foods - the potato puree is a bit more liquefied than I'm used to - it could've been slightly richer and just a tiiiiiiiiny bit better seasoned. While I prefer to include a bit of each ingredient on the plate with each bite, I also like to start my meal by trying everything on it's own and am especially pleased when every element manages to \"carry their own weight.\"]\n* MAC & CHEESE - $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MjlAOhIvQrSWmo0YRi7dPw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3/5 - A combination of blue, cheddar, and parmesan cheese with truffle. Mediocre mac & cheese. Not that well-flavored.]"

It was already suspicious enough they did not seem too apologetic about the situation. No discount was offered nor did they really put in any effort to help us find the purse. The worst part of all, my friend had all her IDs in the purse and she had to go through the process of recovering them all. \nAbout a week ago, one of the friends who attended the same birthday dinner visited Vegas again. While she was using a restroom located next to the Gordon Ramsay steakhouse, she heard someone next stall talking about how the person lost her purse at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Same exact situation!!! Either the security of the restaurant is really bad, or someone inside of the restaurant is stealing customer's purses and the management knows about it but doesn't care. My guess is the managers are involved too, and they probably share the profits later. (My friend's credit card was used to purchase a $4000 LV bag after the purse was stolen, and it went through.) Either way, you would assume for the amount you are paying, you would expect to at least feel safe about the surroundings and not have to worry about your purse being stolen at the restaurant. \nBtw, they used the excuse: oh it's vegas, things like this happens. It does not mean you have to lower your restaurant's service standard just because you are located in Vegas! \nDo not dine at this restaurant or you are going to put your belongings at risk!"

My wife and I had just gotten married (in Oregon, not Vegas...), and we wanted to treat ourselves to the famed Gordon Ramsay restaurant. \nAmbience was great. Dimmed lights, beautiful decorations, and we got a booth with a view of the kitchen. Definitely a romantic feel, which is what I had hoped for being newlyweds.\nThe staff was great. There should be a competition as to who can drink a whole glass of water there before it gets refilled. My wife and I don't go out to nice restaurants very often (she is 2 years out of college, and I'm 86.. j/k, I'm in the military), but we never felt out of place, which I place upon the staff. They were outgoing and attentive, and provided the best service I've ever had.\nThen the food came... I debated giving them 3 stars for it, but felt the staff earned the 5. The food completely ruined any chance of having a \"best steak\" (beef wellington) or \"best soup\" (asparagus soup) anywhere else. Months later and we find ourselves saying, \"my steak's really good! Not Gordon Ramsay Steak good, but good!\". I wouldn't need teeth to eat the beef wellington. The saying \"a knife through warm butter\" has been replaced with \"a knife through a beef wellington\". Don't judge me for my cheesiness there.\n\nAll together, way over 5 stars. Best restaurant experience we've ever had, in every area. Will definitely try to dine here again, although it sounds more difficult to get a reservation now (we made ours the day before... but the finale hadn't aired)."

It was about 10:30 or 11 at night so, as we expected, they were all booked for dinner but had seats open in the lounge/bar. We sat at the empty bar and ordered a long island and a screwdriver. The servers were attentive but not polite. The bar menu has ten options - we got the sliders and gnocchi. Our food arrived relatively quickly and was plated nicely. My dish had about seven gnocchi, with dry-cured ham, heirloom tomatoes, and shaved cheese. However, my gnocchi was cold. Not like room temperature, but cold. I ate it anyway and it was fine, though I think it would have been much better if it were hot when I had gotten it. My boyfriend received a plate with two sliders, which he says \"were fine. Nothing special but not bad.\"\n\nAlthough our food wasn't fantastic, I definitely wouldn't write this place off. It's hard to judge a place based on their bar food only, especially when we didn't order steak at a place known for its delicious steak. I'd like to go back for a full dinner. My only real complaint would be the staff. From the hostess to the bartenders to the person who brought our food, I had the feeling that I was more of a nuisance than a paying customer.

This was so delicious and cooked perfectly, my first time having this ultimate cut of beef and why not? Its Vegas!! To end our experience, we had Ramsay's toffee pudding, so divine and scrumptious worth every penny. \n\nSo here are some tips:\n1. The restaurant is tucked in the back of the Paris Casino, no windows. We were seated upstairs and I had to move it was just too warm for us. Plus I dislike no windows and felt very boxed in. \n2. They were extra accommodating and seated us down on the main dining room floor near the air, which was really great. We had such a better view of all the action.  \n3. The bar is super fun and drinks are great, can dine at the bar too.\n4. Call or book online for reserve seating on the main floor.  Ramsay will not disappoint!

Would come back only for the dessert!\n\nLOCATION: Inside the Paris Casino. It has a huge \"Gordan Ramsay Steak\" sign so you can't miss it. If you're walking in from the Bally's walkway, it's to the right once you hit the casino. If you're coming in from the Eiffel Tower entrance from the strip, walk all the way to the back of the casino and it's on your left. \n\nRESERVATIONS: We booked on Thurs at 10pm. We got there a little early around 9:30 to see if they could get us in and were told the table will be ready at 10pm but we were welcome to stay at the bar. No biggie. We decided to walk around and gamble a bit and came back at 10pm. \n\nSEATING: Once we got in, our hostess told us the lights above mimic Gordan's hand movements as he makes the beef wellington. Cool? The lighting explains why most of the photos on yelp suck. The red lights give everything a dark red color to photos but using flash is too bright and distracting. \n\nSERVICE: AMAZING!  When I made the reservations, I made a comment it was my bday and everyone from the hostess to our waiters all wished me a happy bday :) (no freebies but still nice) Great that they actually read those comments! Both my bf and I were kind of fish out of water, a bit awk because we normally don't go to \"fancy\" restaurants. It was a bit overwhelming for us because it seemed like we had a couple servers. But the waiters were not snooty at all and nice! Heads up, they will come by and wipe down the table to keep it clean between each food course. I thought we were just super messy but they seemed to do that to most tables. Also just like on Hell's Kitchen, they served our entrees and side dish all at the same time. This is why we had multiple servers so they could have two people serve at the same exact time. \n\nFOOD:\nBread: Comp bread. Sadly, I wasn't as in love with the bread as my fellow yelpers. There was variety of diff kinds and we actually didn't finish it. The butter was actually kind of hard so it was difficult to spread. \nDrinks: HK Antioxidant - it was good; very refreshing\nAppetizer: Half Dozen Oysters. These came 3 diff types (2 of each kind pre-seasoned)  2 types were East Coast and 1 was West Coast.  It was the first time I had oysters and they were SO good. They also came with a tiny bottle of Tabasco and side sauces. OMG it was so good and fresh! \nMain course: BEEF WELLINGTON FOR 1 - I was confused on yelp by the photos; some showed 1 piece and others showed 2 pieces. Mine did come with 2 pieces. I gave one to my bf and he gave me half of his AMERICAN RIB CAP. \nThe beef wellington was honestly a bit clumsy to eat but the beef was SO tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare. I personally thought the meat itself was a little under-seasoned but it was pretty good. The puff pastry on top was perfect! The potato puree was more just a decoration, literally a couple of bites if you scrape it together. Vegetables were ok, they were strangely sweet and just a couple bites as well.   \nAmerican Rib Cap- just comes as is. We were both a bit disappointed as it was tougher than we both had thought. It was ok but nothing amazing. We both preferred the wellington :)\nSide: Mac & Cheese - there are so many rave reviews about this mac& cheese on yelp but neither of us liked it :( It was bit cold when we got it and it was too dense and flavors didn't go well w/our meats. \n\nDESSERT: Sticky Toffee Pudding- don't miss out! This dessert itself deserves a 5 star. I was worried about it being a \"date cake\" but doesn't take like it! Perfect sweetness w/the icecream together. Perfect dessert to share for 2. \n\n\nTIPS AND SUCH:\nThe wellington did take about 45 mins and they will time all the food to get to your table at the same time so unfortunately everyone else will wait on yours ;) It's not too bad since you'll get bread but plan on getting an app too. \n\nThey have a Total Rewards pricing, so make sure you to bring your card. We weren't staying at Paris but it looked like you could charge to your room if you are. If you don't have a TR card, get one for free at any TR hotel; Bally's and Paris both have a counter.\n\nDRINK MENU:\nhttp://www.parislasvegas.com/content/dam/plv/Dining/Upscale/gordon%20ramsay/Gordon%20Ramsay/Paris-Las%20Vegas-Dining-Upscale-gordon-ramsay-Gordon%20Ramsay-Bar-7-2014.pdf\n\nDINNER MENU:\nhttp://www.parislasvegas.com/content/dam/plv/Dining/Upscale/gordon%20ramsay/Gordon%20Ramsay/Paris-Las%20Vegas-Dining-Upscale-gordon-ramsay-Gordon%20Ramsay-Dinner-7-2014.pdf\n\nDESSERT MENU:\nhttp://www.parislasvegas.com/content/dam/plv/Dining/Upscale/gordon%20ramsay/2014_Spring_Dessert_"

Mr. Ramsay pays such attention to detail, right down to the red zippers on the hostess' dresses, yet assaults our sense of hearing with deafening techno. Why?\nIf he has a reason I'm all ears.\n\nThe wait staff were all superb. There is not one detail that has not been addressed.  To be insanely picky, the actual food delivery could have been nicer, I mean how the plates are presented. Yes these things matter, they all add to the sense of formality one would want when going to a fancy dinner.\n\nThe mirrored \"meat cart\" is a very good idea in theory, however in its execution I have to say it looks rather silly. I am sure many hours were spent designing and crafting it, but I think it looks cheap. It does not fit in well with the rest of the decor, at least while sitting at a table trying to hear (over the loud music) what the waiter is showing and describing.\n\nThe ingredients were fresh, aged meat very nice, asparagus soup terrific, short ribs fell right off the bone, pork chop among the best, but at most the food is 3.5 stars. Something was missing.  Nice try"

This time however, I feel the restaurant is a bust. He charges top dollar for mediocre food and service that was severely lacking. When we entered the restaurant the hostess greeted us and took us to the lound, but behind her two others who appeared to be on break were a pet get I call loitering in front  of the door twirling their hair doing nothing, didn't bother making eye contact nor greeting patrons. At the bar there appeared to be 2 bartenders who were nice and attentive but at the tables in front of the bar were 4 ladies who I assume we're ushers of some sore who appeared to be quite unhappy who where just standing in front of the empty tables not doing anythinthing. After about 5 minutes the hostess brought us to our table under a red neon light that is a \"sculpture\" of Gordons hand movements we are told. At the table we wait 15 minutes before anyone comes to talk to us about drinks or water (important note since it was 108 degrees in Vegas on this day). We finally got water, then waited another 15 minutes before our waiter showed up with menus, by which time the two tables beside us  who were seated after us already had their appetizers. When we got our bread, I realized we were in a Ramsey show, but the wrong one, it was kitchen nightmares as all the wheels came off the bus, the bread was saturated and dripping is olive oil, not edible.  Finally ordered but then at the last second had to cancel the wellington after finding out there is pork in it (not listed in the menu) and had to wait another 30 minutes for the waiter to come back to reorder. At this point we have become frustrated and even though I am sitting at a small bistro table I can't hear my fiance talking because the music is as loud as a nightclub. When I finally get my meal the chicken is dry, and the sauce is muddy. Did not get offered a dessert menu which we usually get at nice restaurants. At $100 per plate, this was not worth it."

            "review": "We went to Vegas 3 or 4 times a year and we've always wanted to visit the famous Gordon Ramsay Steak house in Paris Hotel and tried the Kobe beef ($32/oz) on a special occasion.  We waited and waited and finally here came our 25 anniversary celebration on July 5.  Our expereince started with a smiley beautiful lady giving us a brief introduction of the history and design of the restaurant.  We were told that this steak house is the one Chef Ramsay freqently visits.  It rasied our hope that the food MUST be outstanding.  Our waiter is escellent.  Very friendly, attentive and informative.  Gave us good recommendations on drinks and food choices.   The bread selection was good, foie gras was excellent and the seafood tower was amazing.  But we were totally disappointed when the Kobe beef steak (8oz) and the Royal Long Horn steak came.  We ordered medium rare and medium respectively but both of them apeared to be burnt, especially with the Kobe  beef.  This dish will definitely be sent back to kitchen if Chef Ramsay was on site, REGARDLESS of the value!  We expected the famous Kobe beef to have marble texture and melt in the mouth but it was chewy and blend.  We had Kobe beef steak in Japan before and that was way better.  The Long Horn steak was slightly overcooked too. The sticky toffe pudding which came with the butter ice-cream matched beautifully, however, the coffee we picked was another disappointment.  It's worse than a donut shop coffee !.  Our bill was almost $800 for 3 but with that qualify of entree we had, totally not worth it.  Again, we believe, according to what we saw on TV about Chef Ramsay's high standard and requirements,  he would never allow the entree to leave the kitchen.  After all, the whole dinning experience was like riding a roller coaster ended with a sad face :("

A large space, both as boisterous and as brash as the chef from which it is derived, our party of six found ourselves in the more formal of the upstairs dining rooms and with a server not just capable but happy to trade jokes with us as the night went on one might say that we ate and drank too much, but with three courses each plus a quintet of shared sides plus a few plates of the complimentary bread I'd suggest we ordered just right - each of the restaurant's signature items making an appearance and all well deserving of the substantial praise.  From supple foie gras and one of the more impressive takes on pork belly onward to perfect Beef Wellington and gamy lamb accompanied by rich shepherd's pie each and every savory to land on the table was well conceptualized and perfectly prepared to medium or rare and with coffees and cocktails equally well-crafted nothing less was expected as dessert, the sticky toffee pudding perhaps the best dessert currently served in Sin City and reason enough for anyone to at least pull up a seat at the bar downstairs."

            "review": "Pretty disappointed with the steaks. I've had much better steaks elsewhere. All the steaks were under salted and under seasoned. I am not the kind of person that sprinkle salt on my food either. I got the beef wellington, and I was really looking forward to it since it was what Gordon Ramsay was known for. The center of the fillet was nice and medium rare, but it got grayish and almost well done as I got closer to the edges. It was quite dry and flavorless. Also, the whole thing started to fall apart when I cut into it. The steak and puff pastry fell apart, and I couldn't get a nice even piece of steak, puff pastry, and the mushroom spread in one bite. This was my first time having beef wellington anywhere, and I was completely underwhelmed. I tried my friend's rib eye and rib eye cap. I thought they could all use more salt to bring out the beefiness of the meat. The meats also lack the dry aged prime beef aroma that you get at other top steakhouses. The aroma of beefiness, fattiness, and deliciousness.\n\nWe got couple sides to share. They were all pretty delicious. The Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and fingerling potatoes were my favorites.\n\nThe service overall was really good and professional. Watch out when they ask you for your water option. They offered us \"still\" or \"sparkling\" water in the beginning. The waiter didn't offer us the tap option. My friend just said still. Then they brought out bottled still water. They were really aggressive with refilling our cups with water. Pretty much we got our glasses refilled whenever a waiter walked by, and then they would bring out a new bottled water. The bottles were also quite small. After I took notice, I asked the waiter how much was a bottle, and he told me 7 dollars. Then I told him to just switch to tap from now on. We had like 6 bottles before we even got our food for 7 guys. And of course after we got our tap water, the waiters didn't bother refilling our cups with water."

The beef wellington did melt in my mouth and the texture and taste were overall tasty. However, it was a bit too cool as if it had been sitting out for at least 30 mins.   If I remember correctly, the bf had the rib-eye.  \n\nWe also ordered the mac and cheese but by the time the mac and cheese came out, we were way too stuffed to enjoy it.  I like my mac and cheese on the creamy side and the mac and cheese here was thick and a bit dry for my taste.  Not a fan. \n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience but it was not worth the price.  The high price basically compensates for the extraordinary service.  I wouldn't go back at this specific location again but if Ramsay opens up another restaurant nearby, I'd definitely try it."

The complementary breads served were absolutely delicious! We ordered the pork belly appetizer and were so impressed!! Definitely recommend that, if you go!!! For our main course, we ordered both the beef Wellington (how could you skip that??), and the Kobe filet with a butter poached lobster tail. Fingerling potatoes with truffles, and mac'n cheese, rounded off the meal. Ok...when a steak is so tender, your knife has difficulty cutting it because any pressure forces the meat to \"surrender\"....RIDICULOUS!!! Get the Kobe!!! Beef Wellington...amazing!! Both sides?....amazing!!! Portions, especially the lobster tail, seemed a bit small, but that worked out \"famously,\" giving us \"room\" for dessert!

From the entrance inside the Paris casino, to the plush high back seating, everything about the restaurants appearance was top notch. \nI arrived for dinner after making reservations with the Open Table app to a dimly lit clean table on the second floor. The main area below contained the bar as well as a large area of dining tables. The lower level was very busy at the time, so the second level is the way to go. The tables aren't crowded together, and you can look out and see the nicely decorated restaurant below. \n\nAs far as service, they are not in a hurry, so I wouldn't try to fit this in before a show. It is a dining experience, and the servers take their time. I had two servers, one that made sure my basic needs were met, and a main server who took my order. It was confusing after awhile as neither one of them brought my food or cleaned my table as I finished my selections. So make sure you allow at least two hours to eat if not more. \n\nFood. This is where I wasn't impressed. Yes it is Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and for the high prices, I expected more. I received a plate of bread which was fantastic, then they bring around a table with the cuts of steak so you can see what you are getting if you decide to order a steak. The steak was more medium than medium rare. A mistake that shouldn't have been made considering the $70 price tag. That is just for the steak, not the sides which are ala carte. The Brussels sprouts were awful and I couldn't even eat them. The portions are large, so you won't go away hungry which is a plus, and the asparagus soup with crab was incredible. My wife had the Wellington which she really enjoyed. This location did not offer lobster risotto, but did have a Hell's Kitchen tasting menu for $145 a person which included a signed picture of Gordon Ramsey. The catch though is that you have to purchase two if you want to try the tasting menu, so be prepared to spend $300 if that is something you're interested in. Overall it was a nice experience though, despite the overcooked steak. It is worth paying a visit to, especially if you are a Hell's Kitchen fan. My wife is a fan, and she had a great time, so guys take your wife for a nice dinner. Three stars overall"

Super delicious and tender.\n- beef Wellington is a classic and it was great. We ordered a dish for 1, to be split into 2. But we were served lobster Wellington instead. After telling the server this mistake, we were immediately given an upgrade: Wellington for 2 people, which is practically twice the price. This was unexpected and was a great gesture.\n- toffee pudding for dessert is also super worth it. We devoured it even though we were full.\n\nCons:\n- ok, still water is $9 \n- the waiter mentions the risotto when he was introducing the menu, which he said compliments the Wellington. We nodded away, but did not include it on our order. After we were done with placing our order, the waiter asked: so do you want the risotto as app or with the entree? Thinking the risotto comes with Wellington, we said: with entree, I guess. When the bill came, we were slapped with the price of the risotto, $68. Ouch. So, lesson learned... don't be suckered by sweet-talking waiter. PS, the risotto was undercooked (the rice was a little crunchy) and the wine undertone was overpowering.\n\nThanks for the experience, but we won't be returning."

We were very impressed by the cart of meat that was brought around for us to choose our cuts, and we were very pleased with the wine selections. Our food was beyond incredible. The steak didn't even need to be chewed as it was so tender and perfectly cooked. We enjoyed several appetizers (I suggest the asparagus, gnocchi, and the foie gras. Even the free bread was amazing! For dessert we ordered the signature Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was the perfect way to end an incredible experience. I cannot understand why people said that the restaurant was too loud - my cousin and I enjoyed great conversation and incredible food and drinks in a wonderful atmosphere.

            "review": "This restaurant beats the steak restaurants in my hometown of Seattle.  I made my reservation for 5:30.  No matter how early you arrive, if it's not exactly your reserved time, don't expect to be seated early.  Don't waste your time hoping to eat earlier to catch that show you bought tickets for in two hours.  My husband and I arrived 10 minutes early and were shown to the bar to wait to be seated at our dinner table.  Not sure why they are such sticklers but when the hostess showed us to our table there was nobody in the room.  I read of complaints that the restaurant is loud and noisy but had a pleasant experience on the second floor in the big room on the right.  Maybe it can be requested or maybe not.  They started filling the room after we were seated.\n\nI read other Yelp reviews and suggested to my husband what were the popular choices.  He was interested in the pork belly and went with the rib cap.  I knew I wanted a salad from all the rich foods I had eatten on the previous days and ordered the beef wellington.  \n\nEverything was great but I learned I am not a beef wellington kind of girl.  I guess I do not like pastry wrapped with my steak.  Being unable to finish it I did end up packing it back to the Trump Hotel, where I enjoyed it more the next day.  Funny how leftovers work.  All in all I would choose my husbands order of pork belly and the rib cap hands down.  The pork belly was so soft it melted in the mouth.  The rib cap was tender yet flavorful.  Order those two dishes whatever you do!\n\nLast we ordered the famous Sticky Toffee Pudding and oh was it good!  I was stuffed beyond measure but had just enough room to finish everything off the plate.  \n\nSomeday I will be back."

After reading the wonderful reviews, we booked a reservation.\n\nDressy attire required, NO TANK TOPS ALLOWED!  We were not dressed to impress & the hostesses seemed like they wanted to revoke our reservation because they were extremely snobby towards us.  Thankfully, our server, Mathew, was kind!  At Gordon Ramsey, they give you a display of their meats so you know exactly what you are ordering.  It was surprisingly loud in the restaurant & as he was explaining the meats, we could barely hear him.  We ordered:\n\nWater - Not free!  $9 for the inexpensive water.\nPlate of assorted bread - Complimentary.  I liked that they gave us a variety of bread.\nBeef Wellington - This is their most popular meat!  Tender, juicy beef served in the middle of puffy bread.  This is the first time I have ever eaten something like this & my mouth enjoyed it!\nKobe Rib Cap - Mmm, melts in your mouth!\nMac N Cheese - Bread crumbs on the top.\nGrilled Asparagus - Good!\nBone Marrow - My boyfriend raved about their bone marrow but for me, I stayed away.\nToffee Pudding - A must order!  I repeat, a must order!  Omg, yet another thing I have not tried before & my mouth & stomach were so thrilled that I did.  The Toffee Pudding just melted in your mouth & my taste buds celebrated!  It came with a slice of ice cream & it was the perfect pairing with the pudding.  I just wish there was more ice cream!"

The food was very good (my dinning partner and I both ordered the 24oz Rib Eye, Fingerling Potatoes and Mac & cheese), and the service was excellent (one minor mistake when after we asked the waiter to box our leftovers, he failed to mark the take out boxes as to who's dish belong to who, and since they were both identical dishes, it was impossible to tell). As far as the ambience, unfortunately this resturuant makes the same mistake that many Vegas resturants make today, which is: Most people (regardless of their age) who go out to dinner, want to enjoy their meal while speaking with their friends/family at their table...but they can not do that easily if the resturant is blasting loud club music. Don't get me wrong, I love loud music...but not when I am dinning. The music was so loud that it really did feel like you were eating at a bar dance club. We complained about the loud music to our waiter, and he was nice enough to move us to a small semi private room that was separate from the 2nd floor main dinning area. This room was great, as the music was played at a low background level (as it should be). \n\nOne final note, many resturants (including this one) are now using iPad like devices to allow customers to select/order drinks. I see this more as a unecessary novelity....but I don't have an issue with it, as long as it works...unfortunately, the waiter was not able to get the iPad working (sometimes technology can make simple things much more difficult....which is the case here)."

            "review": "This review is overdue, but I finally had to write it as this was the worst fine dining experience of our lives! I made reservations months in advance for my husband's 40th birthday and even included in the notes that we would be celebrating. \n\nHowever, not once was this acknowledged. I even reminded our server as he showed me the way to the restroom. Nothing. Not even a measly happy birthday from the server. But that was not even a big deal compared to the rest of the evening.\nWe started our meal off by ordering the seafood tower and a bottle of champagne. As we finished eating the seafood tower we were not even close to finishing the bottle of champagne and yet they removed our glasses not asking if we'd like another glass before our meat course arrived. In fact, the bottle and its stand were completely removed from the area as they cleared the table.\n\nWe were then served our meat course, a filet medium rare for myself and the infamous beef Wellington for my husband. After placing servings of the sides on my plate I cut into the filet only to realize it was completely rare. Now I never send food back, but I didn't want to eat a rare steak so we politely let the server know. He asked if I was sure and then stated he would be right back. After waiting a few minutes, another server came and asked that I cut the filet in front of him to show him that it was rare. What?!! It's not enough that I wasn't satisfied?!? Anyways, of course upon cutting it he agreed that yes it was rare. So without any apologies my filet with all the sides were taken away. After quite some time my plate returned with the same piece of filet I had cut before, cooked to medium rare, but without all the sides. One, I was surprised that they returned with the same piece of filet that they had made me cut up to prove that it wasn't cooked. But two, you pay extra for the sides and yet all of that was trashed. Again, no apologies or attempt to offer a dessert or even a cocktail to remedy the fact that I sat and waited and waited while all the sides got cold and my husband was left to eat alone. \n\nAt the end of the meal, we weren't offered the rest of the champagne. In fact, there was not even any mention that any was left. At this point, we asked about having any remaining champagne and low and behold the bottle came back out and there was more than enough for each of us to have another full glass.\n\nWe have been to many fine dining restaurants around the world and none have left such a bitter taste in our mouth. The service was cold and with the exception of the seafood tower the food wasn't even good. I've forgiven bad service if the food is delicious, but that clearly wasn't the case. And the whole meal cost us north of $500 for two. Take my advice and take your money and appetite to many of the other wonderful steakhouses in Vegas."

I love being able to look through the wine & cocktail list on an iPad too! Bread service is amazing! Love the variety & unique flavors (truffle & pancetta pinwheels are like crack they are so good!)\n\nBeing a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay I felt it proper to order the Beef Wellington. OMG This is definitely the best thing I have ever eaten! Perfect flaky pastry crust & melt-in-your-mouth perfectly cooked filet inside. My boyfriend wanted to sneak a bite & by the time he got around to I had inhaled it! The baked potato was as big as my head & smothered in smoked gouda bechamel with bacon. I could've bathed in that sauce it was so good. The boyfriend ordered the NY Strip with Foie Gras. Steak was again cooked perfectly & the seared foie gras melted as soon as it touched my tongue. Wish we had room for dessert!\n\nLoud, club-like atmosphere was perfect for our double-date dinner with friends before hitting up the casinos. GREAT service & worth every penny you spend!

As a pre-thought, I love Gordon Ramsay and watch all his shows and have waited till one day I would be able to taste his signature Beef Wellington and other dishes like risotto and scallops! So on my trip to Vegas, I made reservations at Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris and had an amazing time. When we get there, they tell us there is a limited time Hells Kitchen menu with a 5-course dinner..ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? of course! we will take two!!!!  Before we start the 5-course, we get a sampling of different breads(all good) with butter and volcano salt. We are even offered to pick drinks from their mixology menu which is on an iPad, very nice. Now we move onto the 5-course dinner and it entailed: 1) Scotch Egg (basically a soft boiled quail egg which had a fried coating but the inside remained perfect??dont know how they do it!) 2)Beet Salad with salmon and a cream cheese puree, actually really liked it. 3)Diver Scallop with Squid Ink Risotto and Truffle 4) Signature Beef Wellington with potato puree and roasted vegetables 5) Pear Tart with salty peanut ice cream and volcano salt. Every course was delectable and cant wait to go back!!!! 5 stars baby!"

We were there for a special occasion and a bit disappointed when they sat us at a table for two at the end of a high traffic aisle and about 18 inches from another couple.  We asked for a more intimate table and were moved upstairs to a nice circular booth.  The steak tower presentation was a great touch and helped us select our dinner fare.  We had the Wagyu end cap and Beef Wellington and they were the best we have ever had and cooked to perfection.  The only reason we couldn't rate this 5 stars is that our waiter was terrible, slow and arrogant.  If not for the assistant waiter we would have been there for another hour.  It could be that we were a couple and he wanted 4 people at his table, but his attitude did detract from the experience.  We will repeat and hope to have a different waiter next time."

But like a jerk, I never knew you existed on your own, separate from my now-former favorite cut of meat: the ribeye. You've always been my favorite part of the cow, but I never knew it was possible to have you and only you...Gordon Ramsay Steak made a dream (I never knew I had) come true. The fact that they offer this piece of meat is worth the 5 stars alone. Google it. You know you want to...\n\nAnother 5 star item? The sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. Not only is the presentation clever (the brown butter ice cream was served as a \"stick of butter\"), but the flavor lives beyond the looks and the hype. My friends and I agreed: we're willing to brave the Strip traffic and casino smoke to sit at the bar here, have some Rince Cochon on tap and some sticky toffee pudding.\n\nOther notables:\n-the variety of the menu- it is a steakhouse, but if you feel the need to veer from their specialty, they have several seafood and other meat options. My friend got the Fisherman's Grill, a sampling of seafood that includes shrimp, salmon, mussels, lobster and perfectly cooked scallops.\n-beef wellington - how can you visit a steakhouse envisioned by a British chef and not experience tender bites of beef wrapped within puff pastry that's not even soggy on the bottom!"

Unfortunately, our experience with the food at Gordon Ramsay's Steak was so disappointing that I feel it is a disservice to other readers not to post a warning among all other high praise reviews. Take heed. Our party lives and knows food [ successful home chefs] as well as being globally well travelled. We appreciate how difficult it is to get a well seasoned and perfectly cooked dish out from a busy kitchen. Most diners are oblivious, we are acutely aware of the skills required.  My chicken entree was visually delightful, but as dry as the sands at Death Valley. Really? It had to be washed down with water. I gave 3/4 of it to my husband to finish.  A roasted chicken at Costco is more succulent and flavorful. I am not being flippant. Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.  My husband's salmon was cooked perfectly and was of a superior type of salmon [ apologies to my Scandinavian  friends who know immediately] . However, it fell miserably flat as far as seasoning. [ We went to another restaurant in LA 2 days later who produced a seasoned salmon which made my husband genuflect in reverence]. The 3rd member of our party did throughly enjoy his short ribs. Bravo to the person who cooked it that evening [ 8/1/12]. Each of us found it personally offensive to be charged extra for a sauce option for any of the steak entrees. Diners beware. A filet mignon priced outlandishly high, demands an additional charge for any sauce. To our favorite Chicago Steak house restaurant readers, your eyeballs will pop out of your heads with dismay.\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was exquisite. Kudos to the designer. Our service was impeccable. That stated, I will eat in a hole in the wall for well crafted food. Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."

The meat presentation was very cool and thorough. Food was delicious.   Mac n Cheese and baked potatoes were both excellent.  My filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My husband's ribeye was a little overdone - ordered medium rare, came out a little more than Medium.  Sticky toffee pudding was yummy - extremely moist and the presentation was adorable.  \n\nNow for the main negative.  Our waiter was terrible!!  Our server, Tony, was clearly upset that we didn't order any cocktails and, therefore, reduced the overall tip possibility for the table.  Once we indicated we were not drinking, his level of interest in serving us all but vanished.  Took him 10 or more minutes to come back to take our order. Discouraged us and other tables from ordering the beef Wellington (I assume due to time and desire to turn the table).  Didn't come to the table when the food was dropped to make sure we had everything.  Checked on us one time while dining.  Did get a little pep in his step when we ordered two desserts, but it was too little too late. \n\nThank goodness for our great server assistant, I think his name may have been John.  He was great!!! Incredibly personable.  Spent at least twice as much time checking on us and chatting with us than our waiter did.  If I could have requested that my full tip had gone to the assistant, I would certainly have done so."

He was busy but still very attentive to us - making small talk whenever he can and made sure our food was to our liking and giving us his suggestions. The ma\u00eetre was very friendly and warm.

We ordered the gnocchi for an app which was accompanied by delicious home made breads. And we shared an incredible porter house steak with a side of brussels spouts and Mac and cheese. Everything was served in a very presentable manner and timed well. This was hands down, one the best meals we have ever had! \n\nI think what impressed me the most was how clean the entire restaurant was. Our table was facing the kitchen and we saw first hand how much pride Chef Ramsey had in having a clean kitchen and restaurant. Every detail was accounted for. The chefs, the food runners were constantly cleaning. Our server made sure our table was always clean - meaning, no crumbs on our table and if a plate was empty, it was immediately removed from our table. We also noticed that the bar was spotless! When a bartender was not helping a customer or server or was not making a drink, they were cleaning. I've never seen a restaurant or bar where every single person who worked there knew the importance of cleanliness, so this was pretty impressive in my eyes. I know to some people, this may not seem like a big deal but to me, this made the experience that much more memorable."

Yes, some of it is a bit over the top, but isn't that the point?\n\nRed-lipped, hostesses in short skirts lead you to your table (your choice of stairs or the elevator if you're on the second floor) and give a brief back story on the art installation in the center of the Union Jack painted ceiling. You'll be given an iPad to browse and order drinks while your server fetches the meat cart--a cart showcasing all the cuts of steak on the menu, which are all described to you in great detail. Service is impeccable. If you order a post-dinner coffee, three spoons are brought out, with liqueur-filled chocolates labeled \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" (for Amaretto, Bailey's, and Chambord) that you simply stir right into your cup. Desserts are offered, but the Sticky Toffee Pudding will be heavily pitched to you in such a way that you really can't resist. \n\nAnd the food? The steak was delicious, but honestly, not the best I've had. It was very good and of high quality, but I typically like simple seasonings with a nice char on my steaks. This shouldn't be taken as a complete negative by any means, just a note on my personal preference. One person at the table ordered the famous Beef Wellington and was extremely happy with it. No complaints about the Pork Belly, Foie Gras, or side of Fingerling Potatoes, either.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding. It's a game changer. I was on the fence about coming back and then the Sticky Toffee Pudding single-handedly sealed the deal.\n\nAn excellent dining experience for sure. John Howie Steak in Bellevue, WA is still my number one favorite steakhouse, but Gordon Ramsey Steak is probably one of the better ones on the strip."

I heard so many good things about the place, and my expectations were met.\n\nWhen you first enter the restaurant, the hostess takes the time to explain to you the setup and decor of the restaurant. Not long after we were seated, our waiter came up to us to give us menus. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. He took the time to explain to us all the different cuts of meat available while displaying a cart with huge slabs of each type of meat.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Bone-In Rib Eye and Kobe Skirt, along with a side of Fingerling Potatoes and the Maine Lobster as an appetizer. Everything was delicious! Even the free bread (3 different kinds) was gourmet and not the typical cheap stuff. The lobster was stuffed with chorizo (yummy!) and the creamy sauce added nice flavors to it. We asked for both our entrees to be cooked medium, but the rib eye was little undercooked so we had to send it back. Aside from that, everything else about the rib eye and Kobe was great. I also enjoyed the truffle oil that was added to the crispy fingerling potatoes. Although we were full, we had to try at least one of the desserts and ordered the Banoffee. It was a delicious combination of banana (in small pastry tarts), toffee, and coffee ice cream. \n\nAlthough the food was great, the part that impressed me the most was the service. We had an early dinner at 5pm, but the restaurant got really crowded not long after we arrived. Despite this, we still received a lot of attention from our waiters. They were all friendly and polite, and often came by to wipe away crumbs or water on the table.\n\nThe food here is pricey, but I wouldn't mind dining here every once in awhile when I'm in Vegas. It also depends on how much you order and plan to eat. Between the three of us, we had more than enough food to get full off of (came out to ~$65/person after tax and tip). Also, make sure you give them your Total Rewards card to save a couple dollars on each dish!"

We made reservations at 5:15 pm, we arrived about 8 minutes late and we were seated right away. I know this is a fancy restaurant but we felt a little uncomfortable at first. Our waiter was nice but we could not understand him clearly because he had a thick european accent, not sure from where. I did not like that he made me feel like an idiot for having my napkin on the table jajaja. He removed it and placed it on my lap. For appetizers we order the pork belly, lobster tail and the heirloom tomato salad. Omg the pork belly was delicious, maybe is the Mexican in me but it tasted like carnitas but 10x better. The lobster tail was just ok nothing special. Again maybe the mexican in me but my salad has watermelon and it tasted like watermelon with tajin. It was ok but if I ever go back to Vegas I will order a different appetizer. When it was time to order my friend order the chicken because she does not like steak and our waited gave her this look as if saying \"really chicken\"? Anyways aside from her we all order the beef Wellington. Our server informed us that the sides were small so we should order other sides. We should have not listen to him because we were very full and were not able to finish our dinner. For sides we order mac and cheese and corn. In my opinion they had good flavor but were salty. We were planning on ordering two toffee pudding desserts but were too full, so decided to only get 1 to share among us four. OMG that was to die for and was the cherry on top. I think the price was worth it and I would like to go there again."

It was so great we went back for lunch before leaving town.  \n\nIn Vegas, I've been to Homestead, Ed Ogden, and the Palm @ Ceasars, and Craftsteak @ MGM, so I've had some great steaks, and that led me to a high standard of expectation when Oscar, our bartender, suggested the Kobe Ribeye Cap and described in detail its tenderness and flavor.  He knew his stuff well because we both ordered it and it marked the #1 Steak I've ever had on my list.   The lightly marbled texture gave it an incomparable flavor to any I have ever had before.  We also added the Foie Gras again to top the steak, accompanied with Spinach and the Truffle Mac & Cheese.  Oscar suggested pairing it with a Malbec which I found to be a little dry for my taste, so I chose a nice, aromatic and wet Pinot Noir.  \n\nThe atmosphere was a relaxing change from the loud and excitable sounds of the casino.  The other bartender, Tracy, was very sweet and helpful and I typically wouldn't dine at a bar, but the bar area in STEAK is very welcoming. With Oscar and Tracy hosting us, we felt very comfortable.   \n\nIn summation, if you are looking for the best cut of beef in Vegas and/or decadently prepared Foie Gras, STEAK is the place!  Gordon Ramsay maintains his unparalleled high standard in service, style and flavor and has now provided me with my favorite steak in the world!"

The wait staff is EXCEPTIONAL. Truly awesome service.  The date cake and ice cream dessert was pretty amazing. \n\nThe Ho Hum: The Beef Wellington is much smaller than it appears on the TV show. The BW came with 3 - 4 small cubes of roasted vegetables, like the size of sugar cubes. I expected the size, but pictures clearly showed a bit more quantity. We knew we had to order extra sides which we had and they were delicious.(fried green beans and truffle mac and cheese)  Drinks were not very strong, I had to order an extra shot just to taste the alcohol in my drink.  The music is too loud in the dining area. \n\n\nTo the idiot drunk at the next table: It is not appropriate to touch and play with the meat on the meat display cart. It isn't funny and they should have thrown you out when you tried to rape the porterhouse in front of that table of women. I was surprised the staff just let him behave this way."

Every server, cocktail server and host were excited to be working there and were fans of Gordon Ramsay and his television shows.\n\nOur server was Donnie, and he did everything he could to make sure it was the best meal ever.  He chatted with us about Gordon Ramsay and recommended courses, he even made sure that we were able to taste the Toffee Pudding (which was amazing) even though we had paid for a tasting menu with a different dessert.\n  \nThe sommelier was also very friendly and brought us a great wine at request.  He noticed that we were twins and mentioned that his older brothers were twins.  We arrived early for our reservation and were told we could sit in the lounge so we ordered some signature cocktails (Pimms very nice and HK antioxidant - which was probably the best drink), and we were seated next to some patrons who were having dinner and the conversation was easy if you watch any of Gordon Ramsay's shows.  They said that this dinner was by far their best experience in Vegas so far.\n\nAfter explaining that we'd been to other Gordon Ramsay restaurants our server explained that the scrambled neon light in the center of the Union Jack on the roof of the restaurant was actually a recording of Gordon Ramsay's movements while making a Beef Wellington.  He explained that he was new and another sever Ian had explained that to him.  Later in the meal, Ian came by to same \"hi\" and he was super nice just like everyone at this restaurant.\n\nThe food was amazing.  We had the tasting menu with an amuse bouche of a scotch egg (made with a quail's egg) and the best salad any of us have ever had, with heirloom tomatoes and cheese, then the main course of Beef Wellington and a melon sorbet dessert.  The food was really delicious and well thought out.\n\nWe will definitely come again, we're hoping to do our rehearsal dinner here for our upcoming wedding in Vegas.  Thank you Donnie, Ian and everyone who made our experience so memorable! :-D"

We were not disappointed.  The food, drinks and service were excellent.  We started with two different soups, the beer based french onion and the asparagus with the parmesan custard and crab timbale.  Both were unique and delicious. My husband had the bone in rib eye steak with a peppercorn sauce and I had the signature beef wellington - med rare is how this is served so be careful if that isn't your preference.  The cosmopolitan cocktail I had there was one of the best I had in Las Vegas with fresh squeezed juice which makes all the difference.  Finally, we enjoyed the British flag painted on top of the ceiling with the red neon lightning coming out and the sort of loud but fun club kind of music playing.  It was a good time and we will definitely be back.  The hostesses at the front of the house need a bit more training though - not sure how they were planning on finding us in the casino if we hadn't checked back a couple of times.  Just cute isn't good enough - right Gordon?  This place is worth the price and we will definitely be back!"

Kobe beef (American Wagyu) Rib Cap in medium rare is definitely a winner. It really melts in your mouth. For side orders we had Fingerling Potatoes which is a little on the salty side, and Spinach sauteed with Parmesan cream. With a couple of drinks, just be prepared to spend over $100/pp because even just a bottle of water (imported from Wales) will cost you $8. But, hey it's Vegas. We'll probably go back only for special occasions."

Everything was crisp and clean with an atmosphere that makes you feel important and relaxed at the same time. Our wait staff were excellent.  Very knowledgeable, accommodating and personable.  \n\nIt was my birthday, you see, and this was the perfect treat.  The bread sampler was terrific but the star was the volcano salt on the butter; superb. I had the pork belly for an appetizer and the tomato bacon jam on top was out of this world.  It pained me to have to share. \n\nMain dish I had the  American rib cap steak.  We don't have any place around here that carries it and I had been dying to try. Holy crap on a cracker, that was the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. Perfect flavor, great seasoning, and superbly cooked. Steak will never taste as good as it did then.  The corn side dish was mind blowing as well. The  b\u00e9chamel sauce in there balanced the tad of heat and it was difficult to stop eating.  The Mac and cheese was terrific as well and had the right about of creaminess with a touch of the truffle flavor to make it really pop with flavor.  \n\nFor dessert we ordered several things so we can have a good try of each. The bread pudding was the best version of that dish that I've had in a very long time.  The sauce with the brown butter ice cream were the perfect compliments.  The carrot cake had a very crisp flavor and loved the candied mini carrots and bits of ginger. \n\nThis was the perfect birthday surprise. They only thing that would have made it better would have been a visit to our table from Gordon himself.  Maybe next time?"

            "review": "This place certainly lives up to the hype, although falls a tad bit short in a few areas (all easy fixes). Our group of 10 arrived a few minutes before our scheduled reservation, and we were immediately seated in a dining area upstairs. Our server and the shift manager introduced themselves, and then we received our dinner menus. The drinks were on point! And the food... Well... F**king delicious. Everyone at our table enjoyed their respective meals, and we left full enough that we all had to do shots of espresso before leaving. Payment was already set up, so once we were done eating, we were out quickly with no problems.\n\nFor my meal I had the British Ale Onion Soup (First Course), Beef Wellington (Second Course), and Sticky Toffee Pudding (Third Course). We also received a variety of breads and black salted butter before our first course, and had various sides accompany our second course. Honestly, I thought with the portion sizes and our group size I wouldn't have enough to eat, but like I said: STUFFED. Seriously, I have nothing bad to say about the food... It was just that good. For drinks, bottled water; the Drifter (cocktail); and a Guinness. Of course the Guinness was good, but the Drifter? Man, that ish was DEEE-LISH! Finished the meal with a double espresso, to include spoons of chocolate and amaretto used to stir and flavor the coffee. I'd never seen anything like that before, but definitely had no complaints; it was a tasty touch.\n\nOkay, negatives. The atmosphere of the general seating area is pretty cool. It's definitely got a modern flare with touches of London in there (i.e. color, architecture). I actually kind of wished we were seated there, but it was a little loud... I don't know how folks could hear themselves talk. The dining area we were in would have been ten times better had they simply opened the sliding door; not only was it dark, it got a little warm and stuffy in there. Open the door and it's the perfect place to sit. The next issue was the initial service. It was about 30 minutes before our server took our order, even though we were all just sitting there waiting for him to come to us. Once I called him over everything was fine. I guess that's what you're supposed to do in a restaurant of this caliber: do it like Europeans do. Oh, and the bathroom is located sort of behind the stairs. That was a fun scavenger hunt...\n\nIn conclusion, if you get lucky in Vegas and/or have some money to drop, definitely hit this place up. Great food, decent atmosphere, and for the most part good customer service."

So since we were in Vegas we decided that we needed to try Gordan Ramsey's steak. I made reservations in advance and as soon as we arrived they seated us. \nOnce you step into Gordan Ramsey steak the atmosphere is so different than in the rest of the Paris Hotel. The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. Pretty upbeat. The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood. Talk about service, first off they use an ipad so you van browse your drink selection. Pretty cool I would say. I would recommend getting a Total Rewards card and save a couple dollars here and there but the food was well worth the price.\nWe ordered a fillet of steak, clam chowder, duet of lamb, Mac and cheese and asparagus. The food was really good. My duet of lamb included a small shepherds pie and some lamb. The lamb was great and the garnish tasted very yummy. I was not really impressed by the shepherds pie but it's okay. The Mac and cheese was very good. \nThe service was great in itself. The waitress was on top of things and so were the rest of the staff. Everyone was smiling and friendly. I remember when my boyfriend left to use the restroom and the waiter took his napkin and folded it. Quite impressed."

Came back again this weekend for the Wagyu Rib Cap and it was rather underwhelming. I also ordered the Foie Gras add on which was bland, tasteless and lacked texture. However the biggest disappointment of all was the Beef Wellington which took extra long to cook. The filet was overdone past medium rare and bland and the pastry shell was not flakey but rather soggy and fell apart upon cutting. I may consider coming back only for the Wagyu Rib Cap but that's only because I just love that cut of meat and this is the only place I've seen that even has it on their menu."

I was thoroughly impressed with the iPad wine menu and drink menu. Lots of wines, but they weren't price friendly. They should have more wines priced under $75 a bottle. Not everyone can afford this and the average population that watches this show are of middle class. Service was excellent. We ordered the Pork Belly for an appetizer, although the flavor was there, we really only got to experience a little bit of meat, it was mostly fat. We have had way better pork belly in Germany and other places. $18 for 2 little bites of meat is not worth it to me. My husband liked the meat displayed that they personally brought to the table. I was a little turned off by it. We decided to order the Wellington being fans of HK, but mine was cold in the middle. So after all said and done, we spent a total of $230 for just my husband and me. We didn't even have dessert. I guess we can say we've been there!"

I know my cocktails and I know my beef - GRS delivered.  The Manhattan was served in more of a oversized snifter, but it worked.  I ordered it with GRS' signature Knob Creek - I still can't place the distinct flavor, but it was yummo.  Without a reservation on a busy Tuesday night, we managed a table in the bar area without a wait.  Service seemed as seemless as it would have been in the dining room.  The service was polished without being cloying.  Not one single menu item disappointed, and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was as good as it could possibly have been.  That being said, at the price point offered, I would have expected no less.  While the French Press coffee was as good as I've ever had, it too needed to be that good at $12.00 for a cup and a half.  The bill was about triple my business per diem, but for the last night in town attending a convention that always wears one out, GRS was the antidote to a long, stressful day.  Highly recommended, but bring a credit card with lots of room."

The gal helping our waiter was OCD about crumbs from the bread, finally picking the last one up with her fingers. They insisted that our wellington be at mid-rare, even though we would have preferred medium, so it was not as good as it could have been (too rare in the center). They were also obsessed with filling our water glasses. Before we ever saw our menus we were asked 3 times about what we wanted to drink, even though we told them we wanted to choose our meal first, then the wine. The drink menu was on a non-functioning iPad that even the busboy could not operate. While we were waiting the exceeding long time for our main course, we were thrilled to here the wait staff (males) discussing different women (our backs were 4 ft away from where the servers gathered - a lovely touch for my wife to experience. Quite frankly, If I had to do it again I would not, even at 1/4 of the price. Last, Gordon is always lecturing all his Kitchen Nightmare clients not to use trolleys (carts) with displays, yet he uses a meat trolley to display all the cuts of beef they serve. \nHaving stated all that, the mac & cheese was wonderful and the recommended dessert (sticky toffee cake) was fantastic. The appetizer (crudo) was okay but only half as good (and twice as expensive) as what we get at our favorite sushi place."

That is when she recommended a gin based basil infused rock candy drink with cucumber juice, If it wasn't for the fact that it was fifteen dollars I would have ordered 15 more.\nThen out of no where some young lady called to me by first name an told us that are table was ready.\nWe got to are table and that's when the first hiccup happen, We sat there for about 15 mins before someone came to the table to even greet us, An it wasn't even are waiter.\nSo I figured are guy was busy and I let it slide\nWhen are guy did arrive he gave us that stupid little Ipad so we could order drinks...An then told us that the meat cart was being used and it would be awhile before he could get it, because \"seeing the meat may make you change your mind on what you are going to order\"\nWell really it didn't..but we had to wait, cause the guy just diapered.\nWhen he did get back it was probably another 20 mins....\nSo 35 mins later we now had the chance to order but not before the 10 min speech of what kind of meat was on this cart.\nSo anyway......\nWell having been in the industry I told my table to order everything that they wanted an let them send it out when it was needed.(that in itself is a gamble but I didn't not want to wait another 25 mins just to get an app)\nSo having placed our entire order some 20 mins later my soup an app came out at the same time as did for the rest of my table. With my waiter no where to be found.\nthen some 30 seconds later my waiter did arrive an lean over to me an apologizes for the double dip saying that it was only suppose to be the soups that arrived...We are pretty low drama kind of people so I said no worries but it still kind a pissed us off.\nSo after we all finished our soups and moved to are app, we placed are pretty big size soup bowls in the middle of the table and their they sat foooorrrrrrreeeevvvvvvvrrrrrr \nAn when we all finished are apps.....Those plates sat in front of us....fooooorrrreeevvvvrrrrr..... So I don't know if it was busy in the back...Maybe are guy was new but no service then over service, kind stunk.\nI ordered\n1)Asparagus soup\ndungeness crab, parmesan custard, pickled white asparagus, smoked salmon caviar... The asparagus was green so I couldn't figure out where it was suppose to be white..but let me tell you this was by far the best thing that ate this night.\n2)Smoked Beef Tartare\nlemon zest, red onion, capers, guinness infused mustard seeds, yukon gold herb chips... The presentation was amazing because it comes in this smoke filled glass dome and they open table side. If you don't like capers stay away it was a bit over powering and with the home made chips the extra salt is almost an over kill.\n3)Roasted Beef Wellington\nI mean what can I say, This is the dish that has made this guys career, It was everything that I hoped it to be an then some.\n4)Mac & Cheese\nblue, cheddar, parmesan, truffle, This was simple amazing. It comes in a small stainless steel kettle and more them likely you will have enough to take home.\n5)Melon sorbet (maybe) My best man ordered the bread pudding that everyone is raving about so I went another route for 2 reasons. I just ate enough to kill a horse and knew that a bread pudding was going to be to heavy and...also giving the table a chance to see something different. An I was right, The bread pudding only got eaten 1/3 of the way an ended up in a box.\nThe sorbet was perfect,light,creamy,and a very very good pallet cleanser from the crab and the wellington.\nThe one redemption that I will give them is they over heard us talking about the wedding and when the sorbet arrived on the chocolate wafer read \"Congratulations\"  An they presented it to my wife, It was a nice touch and good catch by our waiter so I kind of let him off the hook on the hiccups.\nWith all that being said it's Gordon Ramsay and it was amazing!\nWe dropped a good buck that night  but I would do it all over again,having never been to a place owned by my idol.\nIf your there and don't mind spending...Go you won't regret it. hopefully the service will work itself out in the coming months because I do see that it is a issue in most of the posts.\nNow only if I could have heard him screaming \"It's bloody raw you ass\"\nThat would have made my night.\nCheers."

I was able to sample the 18oz strip, the fillet, and the 24oz bone in rib eye. The aged meat combined with the sear from an extremely high heat produced a really nice flavor. I've dined at Carne Vino several times, Prime, and D.O.C.G for steak and this place would certainly be near the top of that list. I would say the bone in rib eye at Carne Vino is very slightly ahead, but I've had both good and bad steaks there so I'd have to dine here again to be sure. The side dishes we had (asparagus, macaroni, mushrooms, and spinach) were well prepared and flavorful, but nothing mind blowing. Our service on the other hand was amazing and turned what could have been a bad experience into a memorable one. (Thank you Jonel)\n\nThe Bad:\nNothing really\n\nThe Could be Better:\nA couple of the appetizers were over seasoned (tortellini, and yellow fin salad), our fillet was overcooked (but promptly replaced, and comped) and the knives. A lot of the silver skin was left on our rib eyes, so attempting to cut through that with the knives they gave us was quite the ordeal. Not having a properly sharp steak knife results in marring, tearing and ripping the flesh. Not only does this spill all the lovely juices everywhere, but it makes it hard work to eat. I will however note that this was not a problem with the fillet.\n\nEvery piece of meat is a little different so I'm willing to give the restaurant 5 stars on account of the excellent service, and the overall great flavors in all the dishes."

With upstairs seating on a balcony type of feel. We were seated upstairs. \n\nEven though we went on a Tuesday night, we did notice the restaurant was on a roll, with a lot of customers coming in and out. Which did mean we did wait a little before finally putting in our order. When it was our turn we were greeted with a meat presentation! Explaining all the different steaks offered on the menu and how each one will taste as well as how it is cooked. It was very helpful! \n\nFor starters they served us three different types of bread. One including truffles.. oh my Goodness it was devine! We also ordered Kobe beef sliders, and I must say it was the juiciest slider I have ever tasted. The kobe beef was extremely tender and full of flavor. Melted in our mouths! \nFor our main course my husband and I ended up ordering the 24oz ribeye. Which was definitely the biggest piece of steak I've ever eaten! For our sides we ordered grilled asparagus and a potato puree. Our streak was done medium well. It was delicious!! \n\nAlthough the waiter didn't spend too much time with us. We did have a lovely time. I must warn you though with quality you do have to pay, our bill averaged around $250 (including tip). \n\nOverall we were extremely happy with our experience and the delicious dinner! \n\nThank you Gordon for a great time.

            "review": "As big of a fan of Gordon Ramsay's shows, recipes, and techniques, I was very underwhelmed. \n\nThe restaurant is beautiful, but the music was very loud and didn't seem to match the atmosphere. \n\nFor the food, my mother and I shared a Caesar salad as an appetizer, had the Beef Wellington as entrees, which we had come out with the bone marrow add-on, and finished by sharing the sticky toffee pudding cake with brown butter ice cream.\n\nNow, I've been a fan of Gordon Ramsay for years. Watching his reality shows, his cooking recipe videos, recreating his recipes and mastering his techniques. I can definitely say that the recipes of Gordon's that I've made were much, much better than this dinner.\n\nThe Caesar salad, overpriced and just \"ok\". It's a salad, big whoop. The little foccacia quail egg was the most memorable thing about it.\n\nThe Beef Wellington- came with a root vegetable puree and some roasted vegetables on the side. By some, I literally mean 4 tiny cubes. The puree tasted like bland mashed potatoes. The Wellington was cut awkwardly- my mother's plate had a much larger piece, while mine was noticeably smaller- and she offered her big piece to me because she doesn't eat much. As other Yelpers said, the phyllo dough and mushroom crust were fairly soggy and flavorless, and fell apart after the first cut in. The meat was very tender and good quality, but also under-seasoned. \n\nThe bone marrow was interesting, as it was my first time trying marrow. It was apparently brushed with a sauce and topped with a salsa verde, but all I tasted was the beefy flavor of the marrow. I'm really unable to judge it against anything, but it was good. Only about 2 tablespoons of marrow, though. Thought there would be more.\n\nThe dessert was the best part of the meal. Absolutely perfect. The sticky toffee pudding cake with brown butter ice cream was the most memorable course of the night.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I can now say I've eaten at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. However, that's all I can say about it without tarnishing Mr. Ramsay's exalted name."

The staff was very courteous and treated us well.  As for the food, it was amazing.  I had the filet with the macaroni & cheese; my wife had the beef Wellington and the loaded baked potato.  For dessert, our wonderful waiter suggested the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream.  It was quite honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Now, the reason I only gave it four out of five stars is because of the appetizer.  We ordered the Herb Ricotta Ravioli ($20).  It consisted of 1 ravioli...  The ravioli was good, but for $20 we expected more than one.  Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and will be back."

I love the Eiffel Tower restaurant for dinner, but this is truly a competitor.  It's not a place you want to wander in wearing shorts and a t-shirt (well, I did, as well as many other DefCon attendees), but if you do, you won't get treated any different.  The bar looks like a place I could spend hours at, just because it's so unique and awesome looking.  But the drinks are crafted by some woman who I can only refer to as a Goddess and the kitchen just does an amazing job on the dinners...I'll be back and not soon enough."

To summarize:\nYes it is expensive\nThe service is exemplary of what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant\nThe culinary presentation is fabulous\n\nWe skipped the Apps and went straight to the entrees. Steak all around (why not) we all ordered a salad and selected our cuts of meat from the sample presentations. Needless to say our steaks were cooked perfect as were our sides. \n\nThere is an extensive wine list and our California Cab was a perfect pairing. I would be remiss if I did not mention my perfect desert dry vodka martini. Even if you do not order a martini order their martini olive combo. It is a halved green olive stuffed with a white onion, blue cheese, and bacon. My dining companions heard me oohing and awing over the olive so we ordered 4 more at a $1.00 apiece. I will try to recreate this masterpiece at home!! Lastly if you are not famished the entrees and salads can be split, which is what we did and trust me we did not leave hungry..."

I have been to many high end restaurants and this was one of my top experiences. We decided to try different things such as the beef tartar, which came out with a smoky hickory cover and elevated every sense. Second was the mac and cheese with a variety of breads, which we deemed as food crack. Last was the infamous beef wellington. It was amazing, the beef perfect and tender. We were fully satisfied, but even more amazing to meet the hell's kitchen winner who was the head chef, Christine. She was very nice and we thanked her for an amazing meal. So, even not at a table, we were treated like royalty and it was an amazing experience."

I had The clam appetizer which is 70% raw, And I'm clam lover and this dish with zest of lemon on it just brings out the clams own flavor in your mouth.  If I could, I would order another plate of this just for dinner.  For starter I had cauliflower curry soup with scallops, the curry flavor doesn't over power the scallops at all, definitely not heavy and you can actually tastes the cauliflower and scallops all together. Oh love the prime filet, medium rare and it melts in your mouth with house seasoning in it.  Don't even need the sauce cuz the steak itself give a rich flavor already. Totally worth the money to come here for a nice delicious dinner.  I feel the money was well so spent let alone the service was fantastically great!  Water and wine was refilled within reasonable time frame. Our server was pleasantly funny and always have a smile on his face.  I would definitely come back again when I'm in town."

That's annoying because they make money off the corkage fee anyway. Don't listen to the wine connoisseur who talked me into a $50 glass of wine from a supposedly $200 bottle.

The atmosphere is great-fun and hip-good service throughout-loved the cocktails, salad, and bread-but did not like the entree or side at all. Ordered sea bass at $42, and what arrived was a piece of sea bass on a plate with the skin and tail attached which was very off putting. Very little decoration or pizzaz on the plate-and why would any chef think people would want to see the carcass of their dinner? Does a steak arrive with hooves attached? Does chicken come with a beak attached? The side of mushrooms was very salty, and there were odd textures in the mix of mushrooms that just weren't appealing. Should have gone with fingerling potatoes. Credit for accomodating a vegetarian with an entree, but was charged the same price as a full meat entree for a plate of vegetables-and appeared on the bill as chicken breast-should have an appropriate charge for a vegetarian entree. The steak is probably great-but as a seldom steak eater, probably will never find out."

We also had to share one iPad between 6 of us so by the time the waiter comes around  to take your drink order you have likely forgotten what it's called.\n\nI ordered a Pim's Cup.  It was delicious.  My husband ordered the Driftsr which he has deemed his new cocktail of choice.\n\nOnce drink orders were taken we were finally handed out menus; Everything sounded amazing.\n\nWe settled on the pork belly with cheese grits for an appetizer which was melt in your mouth amazing.  The cheese grits were by far the best I have ever tasted and the onion jam that accompanied it made for the effect bite.\n\nI ordered the New York strip and my husband went for the ribeye, we shared fingerling potatoes with truffles and asparagus as our sides and the steak was perfect...aggressively seasoned, hard sear, juicy tender amazing flavoured steak.  The sides were also fantastic.\n\nFor dessert we shared the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream.  The ice cream came on the side shaped as a stock of butter with a small butter knife in it, delicious and clever.  The pudding was light and delicate with amazing flavour and the sauce was warm and luscious.\n\nThe dinner was well worth the pretentious nonsense at the beginning and our servers were bar none super professional, you were never left wanting for anything."

In short, it has been a life changing experience. \n\nI'm not really a steak guy and have had pretty dismal experiences at other steakhouses. That being said, I entered this restaurant with an open mind. I was planning to order seafood, but after noticing that there were next to no yelp reviews mentioning anything other than the steaks, I asked the server for advice. Yes, the seafood is great,  but you really want to try the American rib cap...and so I did. \n\nAfter two servings of the mixed bread plate, we shared the Ricotta Agnolotti for appetizer. Normally I don't feast much on bread, but this was an exception. The tasty assortment provided was accompanied with a circle of butter with truffle salt. The ricotta was tasty and paired well with the iberico ham and pur\u00e9e. Each bite slowly melted into my mouth with a savory transition between the cheese, pur\u00e9e, and ham. A good start to a spectacular meal. \n\nWithin a couple minutes of finishing our appetizer, our steaks and sides arrived. To accompany our proteins, we ordered the mac n cheese and Brussels sprouts.  I generally frown upon the steakhouse style of ordering sides separately, but the quality of each dish was justified. The mac n cheese was rich with strong truffle notes and the Brussels sprouts were savory with the perfect amount of crunch. \n\nI need to reiterate the fact that I'm NOT a steak guy. To me, steak is a tough chewy meat that generally needs to be heavily rubbed with McCormick's Montreal steak seasoning to be palatable.  I've heard that tender buttery steaks exist, but have yet to enjoy one until tonight. The hunk of beef served to me was exactly how the perfect steak has been theorized.  My knife easily cut through each slice, was easy to chew, and extremely tasty. I've tried steak at several high end restaurants before, but have never enjoyed one as much as I did tonight. \n\nTo pair with our meals, we started with a half bottle of chardonnay for the appetizer, and a half bottle of cab for the main course. Both were from Napa. While I tend to prefer Sonoma wines, both were quite good.  \n\nWe were quite full at this point, but saved enough room to share the sticky toffee pudding and baked Alaska. Both were exceptionally good, but the sticky toffee pudding, as touted by the staff, definitely stood out as the clear winner. This says a lot considering I am a chocoholic and rarely eat any desert without it.  \n\nI'm lucky to live in the Bay Area, where high quality food is easily found; however, Gordon Ramsay Steak has made its way to the top 5 restaurants I've had the pleasure to enjoy.  Thank you!"

This was his and mines first time having Pork Belly and I'm glad we got it. I don't think it was big enough to share though xD\nMy bf REALLY wanted to have a side baked potato with his dinner, and the server said the sides that's with the Wellington was basically garnish, and suggested we split the potato. My bf wanted one to himself :P\nWe ended up taking a few bites then having to box it. You get bread so I suggest either skipping the side or ordering it as a starter. We also ordered the Wellington, and it was GREAT.\n\nWe didn't have time to eat dessert, because we were catching a Jeff Dunham show. We spent $190(inc tax) on 2 people,+$20 tip. \n\n*FOOD*\n\nThe bread was amazing. I think of bread as just bread, but it was buttery and creamy and flaky and flavorful. I have fancy bread all the time at home and when visiting family, so this wasn't new to my taste buds. The cheese was also imported and has volcanic salt.\n\nThe Pork Belly was Ah-May-Zing. I've never had it before but it was so good, not overly salty and not a strong pork taste, if that makes sense. It was tender and it was interesting eating it with all the garnish (tomato jelly+cheese+sauce) and with just one bit of garnish(pork+cheese, pork+sauce) each bite was sensational.\n\nWe also got the Beef Wellington. It was very flavorful and the pastry didn't get soggy until my last 5 bites. I also don't smoke or do drugs, so my taste buds work ;)\n\nThe atmosphere was nice. although the red lighting made it hard to take pictures, and the bathrooms were really really small :o Oh and the bathroom napkins were really nice. I've never felt paper towels so plush and thick. I took 2 of them and gave one to my bf as a souvenir xD\n\nPS We ordered a sidecar and the antioxidant acai berry drink.

As other reviewers have stated, the music seemed a bit loud at first (British Rock and Roll) but as I sat down, relaxed, and had some wine I found that I was enjoying the atmosphere. \n\nThe wine list was extensive with options that ranged from reasonable inexpensive ($45-55) to four and five figures. After we decided our appetizer, entrees, and sides we decided on a Sangiovese that was priced at $55 a bottle that was very nice, and pared well with the food. \n\nThe selection of breads was excellent. It included: Lemon Focaccia with Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom with Pancetta and pork fat, Baguette with Blue Cheese and Blue Cheese and Walnut served with butter with sea salt. The Black Truffle Mushroom with Pancetta and pork fat was particularly flavorful, needing no help from the butter. My wife and I committed to having only one bread plate; but, after tasting the selection, we could not say \"no\" when offered a second. \n\nOur appetizer choice was the chorizo stuffed lobster tail with kale and lentils. The lobster was sweet and full of flavor, and the chorizo balanced the dish nicely. My wife is not a huge fan of either cooked greens or legumes; but even she enjoyed the flavor of the lentils and kale. \n\nFoe steaks, my wife chose the prime filet, and I chose the prime bone in ribeye. Both steaks were prepared perfectly at a medium-rare temperature. The sear was great; and the crust on the outside was amazing. For me, this was at least a tie for the best steak I have ever had. \n\nFor sides we selected the mac and cheese with fresh peas, and tempura hericoverts. I learned during this meal that we have been doing mac and cheese all wrong, and that blue cheese is a critical component to the dish. This mac and cheese was easily the best I have ever had.\n\nJon, the third place finisher from last season's Hell's Kitchen has been hired on, and was expediting.\n\nThe desert menu looked excellent; but we were far to full to order anything. \n\nThe service was flawless. Any time our wine or water glasses were getting near low, there was someone to come and refill. The servers were knowledgeable and attentive; while giving us plenty of space to enjoy the meal. \n\nIn summery, I would change nothing from this meal except, perhaps, turning the volume down on the music just a little."

The beginning of our dining experience started off good, by offering us the limited edition tasting menu, and then showing us a display of the different steak options. But everything started to turn after we got our food. I had ordered the roasted chicken with the rice pilaf and the chicken was great, but the rice pilaf was extremely salty and I ended up just leaving it on my plate. I had asked the waiter if there was any other option and he said no unfortunately we do not and walked away. There was also a chicken skin dumpling which did not taste good and it was very greasy. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the bone in New York strip and said it was decent but had better at morimotos in Napa and at delmonico in the Venetian. After we were done eating the waiter brought over the desert menu and we decided to pass on desert and he brought the check. We had paid and then noticed we got charged $9 for the still water. beware, if they ask you when you sit if you want still or sparkling water, clearly explain to them you want regular water if you do not want a surprise $9 charge on your bill. I clearly told the waiter when we sat down I wanted regular water and he looked at me funny and brought the still water anyway and I didn't think to think we would be charged with it at the end of our meal. All the tables around us had the bottles so we jus figured that's all they offered. Anyway I brought it up to the waiter and he waived it for the misunderstanding but for first time experience the service could have been better. We will be sticking to our regular steakhouses when coming back to Vegas."

Being huge Ramsay fans and seeing the good reviews on Yelp, we were looking forward to trying the famous beef wellington. We got the Beef Wellington for 2, a side of the mac and cheese, and the supposedly very 'amazing' toffee pudding. The bread was served with some cold butter w/ 'volcanic salt' that was a bit hard to spread on the bread. Three types of bread were served, but none are that memorable. Our beef wellington were cooked to a perfect medium rare. While the first few bites were to my satisfaction, it didn't have the wow-factor that I was expecting from Ramsay's infamous dish. Worse off, after a few bites, I noticed a terribly bitter taste to the steak. After peeling the pastry away, I noticed that one side of my steak was terribly burnt. The mac and cheese was above average but was nothing special and was way too heavy after a few bites. This supposedly very amazing toffee pudding was decent, but was honestly a let down. It was way too sweet and lacked texture. \n\nFor a high end restaurant, the service left a bit to be desired. The waiter took my entree dish and failed to ask if everything was okay. Everyone sounds a bit rehearsed.\n\nBefore the server took our order, he asked if we are celebrating any special occasion. After we told him that we were celebrating my husband's 30th b-day, I honestly was expecting that he will bring out something special for him, yet there was nothing but a small candle on the desert that we ordered. \n\nAfter trying GRS, I'm very hesitant on trying any of his other restaurants."

Maybe i just dont like the style. \n\nWaiter was helping since he recommend us another wine to go with our dishes and said the wine i wanted it was actuallly too dried.

Had to wait for about 25 min before we got our drinks. Then we had to wait another 45-50 min to get our food. Bread plate was cold and didn't seem fresh at all. The food (once it arrived) was ok at best. The steak was good, but all the sides were oily and not very appetizing. Being a huge Ramsay fan, I was floored and extremely disappointed with the service, attention from the server we had and the hostess. When I tried to speak with someone about the service I was told they manager isn't available. There is NO WAY I would recommend this to ANY of my friends and I don't ever plan on going back to this restaurant. Disappointed is just the tip of the ice berg for how I felt when I left."

The service was really polite.\n\nWe ordered the famous beef wellington, side of shishito peppers, and the ribeye cap.\n\nThe beef wellington was underwhelming due to my expectations for it. After watching years of Hell's Kitchen and Masterchef, I thought it would be this flavor explosion of a dish. Unfortunately not. Although it is the best beef wellington I've ever had, it lacks a bit of flavor. It is super tender though. It's very soft and still a very beautiful dish to look at.\n\nThe ribeye cap was absolutely delicious. It had a punch of flavor. Our waitress recommended this one, and we were not disappointed. Not only does it have flavor, but it has great charring and still extremely tender at the same time. Husband and I agreed that this was probably the best steak we've had in a while.\n\nThe shishito peppers were super flavorful as well. Lot of flavors going on, and not all the peppers end up tasting the same: sour, salty, bonito flaky. Beware that some of those peppers are wicked spicy while others are not spicy at all."

I'm not even gonna compare this place to any other over priced/overrated restaurant on the strip.... (most the steakhouses on the strip are a little stiff and unimpressive/ or just trying to hard). However the single greatest place to eat on the strip hands down, is Gordon Ramsay Steak. Amazing cocktails that were Huge and delicious.(English garden really cools you off after a day in the hot Vegas sun!!!)Maine Lobster tail stuffed with chorizo was perfect and reasonably priced(for a lobster tail on the strip!) The caesar salad with tiny little scotch quail eggs was the best salad ever with a twist on the classic. Asparagus soup was phenomenal with great presentation and unique combination of flavors. The bread was fantastic as everyone has been saying on here. (Truffle, prosciutto, and focaccia.) Now for the main course....... The single greatest steak of my life had to be the Kobe rib cap! When people say some crap steak from any other steakhouse melts in your mouth they have obviously never tasted this cause it actually melted in my mouth, not joking! I thought an 8 oz steak would be to small for me cause I'm a big guy but it was so rich, (maybe cause of the bone marrow my dumb ass got to put on top, however it was worth getting that too) I actually couldn't finish it. The bone-in dry aged rib eye was also phenomenal. Had such a nice distinct flavor to it from the dry aging that I almost couldn't decide which steak I liked more(rib cap won by a little bit). Sides were great we tried 3 (truffle mac, fingerling potato, creamed spinach) All complimented by a great bottle of wine from a rather nice wine list. But..... as good as dinner was and no matter how great the service from Mark was it was nothing compared to the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream!!!!!!! Holy $@%#!!!! Go eat here you will not be disappointed. And if you are disappointed,  you don't know what you are talking about(cause I went back the next night, got the same great service and the best lamb duo ever that even Charlie Palmer from Aureole would be jealous of and the best fish and chips ever!!!!)"

And that cider....so much cider vinaigrette that it made our eyes burn.  Our waiter took one whiff and said \"wow\".\n\nThe  rare rib-eye was incredibly well-done, and my Glaswegian Mrs. fish and chips was a soggy train wreck.

There were only two time slots available so be sure you reserve in advance. \n\nWe checked in with the hostess a few minutes before our 7:45PM reservation. A couple of minutes later we were seated at the table on the second floor over looking the restaurant. Great view. \n\nThe restaurant is very noisy so if you are looking for an intimate quiet place this is not it. The music is loud and so is the chatter from the fellow diners. The decor is modern with lots of reds and blues used along with the London flag. \n\nAfter looking over the menu I ordered the chicken breast ($29.) Hubs ordered the beef Wellington ($52.) just like the show) both are listed under signature dishes on the menu. \n\nWe were given an assortment of fresh breads and butter. The focaccia was delicious. Fresh, soft and a little oily. The French bread had a mild cheesy flavor and the third circular roll had bacon baked the dough. \n\nThe food arrived 45 minutes later. The chicken was moist and cooked perfectly. The wild rice was a good side it went well with the chicken. The sauce was a little salty for my liking. I had a bite of the beef Wellington, it was tender and the pastry was soft and flaky. The portions were a good size, almost too much. It was a good thing we didn't feast on appetizers/starters prior. \n\nFor dessert we had the spiced apple cake with salted peanut ice cream ($12.) The cake was served warm with a sweet syrup (probably brown sugar) drizzled on top of the apple slices. The ice cream was delicious and I am not a big ice cream fan. The saltiness of the ice cream went well with the sweetness of the cake. \n\nService was great. We were constantly being taken care of by the staff.

I definitely do NOT recommend begin seated there (that's where they seat the boring old people or the parties with kids).  \n\nNot everyone wanted to do the tasting menu but most of the people ordered a beef wellington (THIS DISH TAKES 45 MINUTES - OURS TOOK OVER AN HOUR).  Mine was perfectly medium rare, whereas the person next to me had one that was overcooked.  The layer of seasoning between the steak and flaky bread was salty and prominent.  You couldn't miss it and some bites I wish I did since it was so salty.  The sauteed spinach, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts with bacon were all pretty good.  But really salty.  I would say the sear foie gras with huckleberries and toasted almonds was my favorite dish.  It was really delicious.  We savored each bite as it is impossible in SF to get any seared foie gras!  Next time I'd order this and the kobe beef tartar instead of a huge wellington.  \n\nWe came here for a birthday dinner and unfortunately, they do not provide any birthday dessert.  We ordered her a chocolate grenache cake ($12 for a stingy slice) and the toffee cake and brown butter ice cream for ourselves.  The latter was outstanding.  Together with the French press coffee, which came with a trio of chocolate liqueur spoons,  dessert was truly the highlight of the meal.  I would come here just for dessert.\n\nJessica was our waitress, but the busser who refilled our waters and cleared our plates, who was also named Jessica, was outstanding.  The waitress Jessica was lacking on the personal side and just rattled off what she was supposed to and didn't offer much else.

We had a magnum of wine we wanted to bring with us.  We specifically asked over the phone what the corkage fee was and if it was higher because the bottle was bigger.  They assured us it was not.  We were very pleased at this.  Only when we got there, they told us since it was the equivalent of 3.5 bottles, we would have to pay four corkage fees, for a grand total of $140.  Now, if that is your policy, fine.  But please have your staff tell patrons over the phone that this is the case.  When the person who came to tell us told us \"he'd make it right,\" we assumed he would.  Well, the bill included the $140 fee.  They eventually did  \"make it right and only charged us for one,\" but you would expect a place of this caliber to not make these mistakes.  I mean, I know that $140 for four bottles of decent wine at a steakhouse is still a steal, but it was the principle of the inconsistency that bothered me.\n\n2. The decor and vibe of the place is great!  Very hip.  LOVE the Union Jack on the roof and the music.  BUT ... if you go in a slightly larger party (we had 7), they might stick you in a stuffy, typical steakhouse room.  I was so disappointed.  I wanted to ask if we could be moved, but my party was being complacent, so I shut my mouth.  LOL  Just be aware of this - that if you are trying to go because it's NOT the typical steakhouse but go in a group, you might get stuck there.  If you don't want this, I would tell them when I make the reservation.  \n\nHaving said this, the food was fantastic, as were the waiter and bus boy service. I agree that the commemorative and autographed Ramsay prix-fixe thing is a little tacky.  The fried blue point oysters were fantastic, as was the porterhouse for two (although it was a little cold).  The mac and cheese was also great, but anything that has truffle oil gets my vote.  The people at the table who had the famous beef wellington were impressed, and the sticky toffee pudding was amazing. Oh, and my martini had this olive in it with bacon added to the blue cheese olive (it might have had another cheese in it; can't remember .. bartender told me, but I forget).  Point is, it was delicious. \n\nI would definitely give Ramsay Steak a try if I was in Vegas.  I will probably go again just  in a smaller party."

Teach Ramsey  that the Scottish suck haggis at cooking beef."

The only reason I can't give it a full 5 stars is because it was freezing in there. The group next to us said they couldn't feel their toes and I had my husband go and buy me a jacket. Will definitely go back but with a sweater in hand.  I highly recommend the signature scallops, beef wellington, and toffee pudding because my family said they were amazing. I had the seafood platter and it was fantastic. The food all melts in your mouth."

Gordon Ramsay Steak in The Paris was just opening, and my guest and I lucked out in getting a seat for dinner in the lounge.  \n\nUpon entering through the red-lit tunnel, I was impressed by  the restaurant's striking design. We were escorted to our table and quickly read through the mouth-watering menu.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna.  For entrees, we ordered the Beef Wellington and the Beef Short Rib. \n\nAlthough the entrees were truly 5-star-worthy, we found the tuna to be absolutely and shockingly flavorless.  When we informed our server, she responded by saying, \"Oh, really?\"  Later, a bus boy came to remove our appetizer plates.  When he noticed that we had barely touched our $22 appetizer, he asked how it was.  I told him it was nearly flavorless.  He said that he had already heard the same from three other tables.  He removed the dish and told us he would inform the chef.  Unfortunately, no one offered to substitute out another dish for the one we had barley touched.  Perhaps the newly trained staff just didn't know how to respond to guests not enjoying the food, but I expected them to care (at the very least).     \n\nI incorrectly assumed that the dish would be removed from the bill.  It wasn't.  After finishing the meal and paying, I asked to speak with the manager.  I explained the situation, and explained that we had already paid.  She said she was sorry, and to ask for her by name the next time we were in town.  I believe she said her name was Nicole.  Given my high expectations for a restaurant bearing Gordon Ramsay's name, I was disappointed that she seemed slightly unconcerned.  I was shocked that she didn't offer anything besides an apology. \n\nAlthough the entrees definitely met our expectations, I cannot give this restaurant a better rating at this time.  I realize this won't be everyone's experience, but it certainly was mine. \n\nA five star restaurant with one star service, gets three stars.  \n\nUntil we meet again, Gordon Ramsay Steak..."

Word of the wise though is to make reservations because they do book pretty fast, especially on weekends and I can't say I'm surprised. \n\nThe ambiance is totally classy but what I loved about the whole experience is the staff was not uppity up-tight and snobby. Everyone from the hostest to the busser was friendly and relatable. \n\nWe got seated promptly on a busy Saturday night service; with reservations.\n\nThe whole dinner starts off with you server rolling in slabs of different cuts of meat. \n\n**** \nFood was well seasoned and amazing \n \nBread plate might be all to tempting to finish, don't. Save room for everything else, I promise you it will be worth it. \n\n*****Heirloom Tomato Salad; dish is good for 2 people to share. Dressing was made wonderfully and the greens were all fresh and crisp, definitely set the tone for our dinner\n\n*****Maine Lobster; was a winner; it was so fresh and cooked to perfection it had that salty brine taste of the sea with the sweetness of the lobster. And the broth?! Tres Bien monsieur! I could eat this everyday. Yes, everyday. \n\nAnd of course the star of the show \n\n*****Beef wellington; we were a bit confused at first figuring out portion sizes. So let me break it down to you. If you order from the tasting menu, you get an 8oz welly cut in two. And if your order from the regular menu, you get a 16oz welly cheek. \nPastry was so flaky and light it didn't feel lile O was dumping on a ton of carbs in my belly, meat was so tender and cooked to the right temp (medium rare) I didn't even notice I was chewing on meat at first. Everything was so well done and well put together it just melted in my mouth. Heaven I tell ya! \n\nFor our sides we got the Street cream of corn and asparagus. It was all tasty.\n\nAnd for dessert?\n\nYOU CAN NOT, NOT have the sticky toffee pudding, you need it in your life! The pudding's probably made of unicorn dust and pixie dust because it's instant happiness, mixed together with the brown butter sauce in one bite? Guuuurrrl, total foodgasm I tell you. \n\n****************************\n\nService was topnotch our servers were on top of their service, napkin folded every time we left the table and water poured even before we empty the glass. \n\nOur dishes were served with poise and finess. \n\nTiming was en pointe because the our hot dishes were hot and cold dishes didn't melt. \n\n************************\n\nIf I haven't convinced you to try this place yet, you should. Even if you don't know Ramsay or not a fan, it was just an over all spectacular dining experience that will be one for the books."

During me second course on the octopus salad I found a hair on me food. This lead to me being disgusted and after vomiting what I already had ate I decided to not eat anything further do to a lack of appetite after. The rest if the table did finisht the tasting and to them it was exquisite. Sadly I wasn't able to enjoy the beef Wellington. The restaurant did comps the dinner which is much appreciated. I give a low rating since I can't believe I was disappointed by such a class of a restaurant. I've been to various Gordon Ramsay restaurants back home in the U.K and they are epic brilliance. What I've seen is that here in the states from The London in westhollywood who burned me chateau Brianne , and The Fat Cow (now closed), and steak have been below standards at what I believe  Mr. Ramsay would allow. Maybe one day I'll get the delicious masterpiece works that Gordon has delivered in the U.K."

            "review": "First impression of this restaurant: a hassle to make reservations through the phone.  The restaurant definitely needs online reservations, if anything.  I made 2 reservations because I was going twice on different weeks and canceled the first one just because it didn't fit in my time frame in Vegas then.  Whoever picked up the phone was pretty rude and put me on hold twice for about 5 minutes, and then continued the phone call with pretty much no etiquette or class I would expect of a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  Cancelling the reservation was more than a pain in the -ahem-.  Just a little note, this restaurant doesn't start picking up their phones until after 5:00 pm, which is the time they open, so if you need to change you're reservation, it is better to call the Las Vegas Reservation Central... or something like that, which I found out through calling different hotels.  But that's a very long story I do not want to get into.  But make sure you always get your confirmation code!  If you don't ask for it, you don't get it, and a confirmation code is just a precautionary measure for any reservation.\n\nThe second reservation was a little bit better, still needs to work on that professional phone etiquette though.  Same thing like the first reservation, but nicer... was put on hold for like 5 minutes before anything happened.  Only reservation available was at 9 pm. When my guest and I got there, they were running late on reservations and we were seated about 20 minutes after my reservation time.  This was a first for me, because whenever I make reservations at any restaurant, I usually get sat on time, maybe 5 minutes later, but definitely not 20 minutes later.\n\nAnyways, on to the actual dining experience.  The service was everywhere.  The server greeted us, forgot to give us our actual dinner menu but instead gave us this ipad with their alcoholic beverages, and then ran around majority of the time.  The bus runner was asking for our drink orders after the server took it, and gave us our dinner menus.  The server came back a bit later to take orders (which I'm pretty sure he forgot our menus in the first place).  After the server took our menu, the bus person came out with this roll-away model of all the different cuts of beef.  Next time, I suggest the model of cuts of beef should be brought out before taking the order... maybe, so it'd convince me to order the kobe beef filet mignon and not the regular filet mignon.  Bread was served 20 minutes after my guest and I ordered, and right after bread was served appetizers came out. \n\nThe appetizer was half a dozen raw oysters.  The oysters were definitely fresh and incredibly sweet.  Wish the type of oysters they were serving was bigger, but those type of oysters they served were meant to be small.  It was really delicious and definitely refreshing.\n\nA little while longer, the entrees came out - short ribs and the aged beef filet mignon; NOT the kobe beef filet mignon.  The short ribs had this amazing mash potatoes with bokchoy and sauce.  The short ribs were really tender, but the mash potatoes were beyond amazing!!  The filet mignon, was just a filet mignon with their house sauce on it and some garnish. I was hoping that the filet mignon had a bit more Ramsay Flare on it, but it didn't.  I wish i ordered sides, but thankfully, I had my guest's mash potatoes for it.  I do regret not just using the money toward the regular filet mignon for the kobe beef filet mignon because I've honestly had better filet mignons.  Overall, the mash potatoes were the best out of our dishes.\n\nFor dessert, we went for the sticky toffee pudding, which blew my mind away.    The toffee ice cream was shaped like a stick of butter, which I thought was incredibly cute.  The toffee pudding was similar to a very porous cake, with this warm caramel/toffee sauce poured onto it.  The cake soaked the sauce up which made it a bit soft/soggy at the same time somehow creating  a very nice texture.  I honestly wished that I could just eat scoops of that ice cream.  The cake was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but still delicious nevertheless.  Wish the ice cream was just on top of the cake - just simpler that way.\n\nOverall, I felt like this restaurant didn't live up to name of Gordon Ramsay.  I feel very neutral on whether to recommend it or not.  If you're a fan like I am of Mr. Ramsay, then by all means go, but I was a bit disappointed that night.   Despite him always telling his contestants that the guests are waiting for food on hell's kitchen, his own restaurant made me wait.  I'm very iffy on trying this again, but this time for the kobe beef filet mignon, but I'm pretty sure my Ramsay-fan side will make me try it again one more time.  The only excuse I can give the restaurant is that they're new, with no set system in place yet."

Our waiter was nothing but nice and very knowledgeable and helped us pick a very nice wine that paired well with our meal.

It came with 3 types of breads and I think it was a lemon infused butter and wow was that amazing. My wife and I ordered the Beef Wellington (melts in your mouth) and they split it in half for us which was nice. We also ordered the Rib-eye which was so tender and juicy.

So Amanda made a reservation for us on Saturday 12/21 at 7 pm. She was very helpful with this process. \n\nWhen we arrived we had a seat in the bar and was taken to our table promptly. We were introduced to Amanda and our waiter. First we ordered wine (of course) two of us had The Prisoner. We got a couple appetizers Foie gras, onion soup, and the beet and goat cheese salad.  Everything was very good.\n\nFor dinner, two of us had the beef Wellington (very moist filet, melted in my mouth, perfect toasted phyllo dough and perfect taste). Kobe filet mignon was also ordered and that was very good, we got three sides, creamed spinach (very yummy), fingerling potatoes (delish! Omg yummy amount of salt and I believe Parmesan cheese), then I tried the mushrooms again and they were better than last time not too salty, my sis n law loved them.\n\nDessert!!!  Exquisite, Heavenly, sinful, we ordered the toffee pudding. It came with toffee butter ice cream. The presentation was fabulous, the ice cream was shaped like a stick of butter and the dessert was a great size but we definitely all wanted more it was sooooooooo good. That alone I would go back for. So don't miss out on that, please. \n\nHands down I have to say the service was phenomenal!

We all ordered the same thing being the beef tartare as an app, cauliflower soup and the beef Wellington. All were very good. Then came the sides which we ordered mushrooms and truffle Mac and cheese. What took this down for me to only 2 stars are three things. First the service was mediocre at best, the cost is high, so is everywhere in Vegas but still way too expensive for what you get, the third the truffle Mac used truffle oil. I watch Gordon Ramsay destroy someone on Masterchef for using truffle oil and he uses it in his restaurant. I love truffles but not the artificial taste of truffle oil. I just expected for the cost that we would have had a better experience."

I am a HUGE fan of Hell's Kitchen and the first thing I did was find Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. The other reason I chose this restaurant was for the beef wellington. Every season when I watch Hell's Kitchen, I enjoy watching all the chefs who can't cook the beef wellington. So for over two months, I was excited to tell my friends and family that we were going to Gordon Ramsey's Steak restaurant to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. This was the reason for our trip to Vegas and we selected this restaurant for the actual night of our anniversary. I also included a note about that when I booked the reservation via Open Table. \n\nThe night came and when I was looking at the menu, it stated that the beef wellington was served medium rare. I asked my husband if he thought I had to get it at that temperature, because there was no way I could eat it at that temperature. He said he didn't think so. And I agreed, since on the show, Hell's Kitchen, they always cook and serve it at different temperatures, and I have been able to order at a specific temperature at other restaurants. The server came and I inquired about the temperature and he said that it had to be served at medium rare. Something about that is the best way, blah, blah, blah. I said how disappointed I was since that was the main reason we were having dinner at that restaurant. I went with the lobster wellington, and now I know why no one else makes that. It was not good especially for the price. \n\nI would like to say that our back up server (wish I could remember his name) was awesome. Much better than our actual server. We got a lame \"happy anniversary\" and that was it. Nothing else. Needless to say, we will not go to another Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I guess all the perfection he preaches on the show is saved for the show. For the amount of money we spent there, it was definitely not worth it, that includes the food and service."

However, we already had reservations so no backing out at this point. \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant right on time at 7 PM and had to wait 15 minutes for our table. Not a good first impression but not the worst thing in the world either.\n\nThe decor is not so bad. There is an upstairs area that is sort of like a balcony and our group (party of 6) sat in a round booth. Lucky for us that we did. Apparently the chairs here are really uncomfortable. So uncomfortable that a lady asked to switch with our chair that we were using as a coat rack. Yes, there are different chairs for the booths as there are for the tables.\n\nWe knew we wanted the beef wellington and the menu said allow for 45 minutes to prep so we ordered as soon as our waitress came to our table (7.25). At around 7:35 we ordered the rest of our meal. Our food arrived at 8:50........... \n\nBeef Wellington....... trash like what Oscar lives in. It fell apart from the outside layer and the crust looked very unappetizing. It also seemed to lack in flavor.\n\nThe rest of the meal was good. We also had the bone-in ribeye which you can't mess up. However, it wasn't the best I ever had. \n\nWe also ordered dessert which was this chocolate cake with what looked like a stick of butter. We knew the butter (yes its ice cream) would not be enough so we rationed it to go with the chocolate cake. Even with this rationing, we still had half the cake left by the time we ran out of ice cream. I asked for the waitress for some more and was appalled when she said it was $7 more. Such a ripoff.\n\nTLDR: Overpriced, poor service, mediocre food."

It's not necessarily a bad thing, and it's classy showmanship, but everything from the decor to the specialty cocktails to the steak feels like it was designed by someone specifically to market itself as a brand.  But it's all executed well, and I enjoyed my specialty cocktail.  And my husband really enjoyed his Kobe beef.  If you can spare the extra $$$, I would suggest getting the minimum ounces as an appetizer or something.  It really is amazing.  I even tried a little bite, and enjoyed it (and I don't like steak).  My fish dinner was delicious as well, and the pureed potatoes we got as a side were tasty."

It was AMAZING!!!!  My husband and I split the Kobe filet and it was so delicious and flavorful.  My Mom had the chicken and said it was amazing and for sides we had the sauteed spinach, truffle mac and cheese, and fingerling potatoes.  Unfortunately we didn't have time for dessert, but I will be back the next time I am in Vegas.  They have a great drink list and you need to try their version of a blue cheese stuffed olive.  Being that I'm very particular on my olives, this place blew my mind.  They created a \"bacon cheeseburger\" type of olive - it was an olive sandwich with blue cheese, cocktail onion and bacon.  I added a pic, it's a little blurry, but it gives you an idea.  I never would have thought to do that with an olive.  Gordon Ramsay is a genius!    \n\nYou simply must try this place!"

I'd just recommend having a cocktail and the dessert at their bar if time or $$ was an issue. \n\nAnyway, we were seated upstairs overlooking the Tube/Bar area. The complimentaty bread was fantastic. Our fav was the mushroom/truffle rolls.\n\nWe each had a drink which was a decent value here. Their version of Pimm's Cup was light and fruity, and an above avg size for only $15.\n\nFor sn spp, we shared the Pork Belly with Cheesy grits - outstanding!! The grits and onion jam paired perfectly with the pork.\n\nFor a side, the creamed spinach was phenomenal. Best I've ever had. Uber rich and filling. I went with my first ever Beef Wellington and enjoyed it. The fillet inside was perfectly cooked and buttery. My wife tried the RibCap but for the price (65) it wasn't any better than a fillet I just had at the Capital Grille 2 nights ago.\n\nOf course, the MUST ORDER is their sticky toffee pudding. Save room for this. Holy diabetes-inducing desserts! One prob - it needs more ice cream!\n\nSo for a great meal with a big budget ($250 total including tip) try GR's Steak at Paris."

Loved my fried oyster appetizer and others loved their salads.  4 of us got beef dishes, which were very good and cooked properly.  The other had the pork chop and found it a little off.  Mac & cheese side was great but the corn side was a little strange for a fancy place (belongs at a Mexican restaurant or a picnic, we thought).  Okay, the only complaint were the baked potatoes.  We ordered two and they came out barely warm, yuck.  We sent them back and got ones that were warm.  How hard is it to serve a hot baked potato, especially when it cost $12 a piece?  The table ordered the sticky toffee dessert, which I liked but others didn't care for it.  The stick of butter ice cream was brick hard.\n\nI certainly have been to better steakhouses in Vegas (The Range) but I don't need to go back to Steak.

I always wanted to try it but noticed it was rather pricey so I wanted to see what the consensus was before dishing out big bucks.  It was well worth the price though that's for sure.  We are already thinking about what we are going to order the second time around.  Our waiter was Dennis, don't recall the assistant's name but they were both nice.  We did wait a little bit though, which if the prior reviews didn't boast about the excellent service I probably would not have noticed and would have chalked it up to them being very busy.  Prior reviews were correct about the bread selection- all very good.  The salt on the butter was the BOMB!  We skipped appetizers and opted to save room for dessert.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye and I had the American rib cap.  For our sides we selected the mac/cheese and the truffle fingerling potatoes.  Let me just say- I could have just had the sides as my entree because they were both excellent.  Rich and decadent.  I almost felt guilty eating them.  But they were so good.  And let me say the day after they were just as good.  The American Rib cap, which I never heard of before, was excellent.  8 ounces seemed small but it was packed with flavor and with the sides, well I couldn't finish it.  That too tasted good the day after.  My husband's rib-eye although BIG was just alright.  Meaning we've had bone-ins before.  His had a little more gristle than we prefer so he's thinking he'll go with the rib cap next time.  For dessert, we went with the sticky toffee pudding even though I was a little reluctant after trying the one at BurGR- it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But the one here, at the steak place, was excellent.  It wasn't too sweet at all.  We are ready to go back on our next trip."

From the moment you walk into the glass tunnel, we were given a mini tour by our hostess. She was as sweet as could be and told us about the decor.  She then guided us upstairs to our table. \nOur server was Dennis, and his assistant was Ben. To say they were attentive is an understatement.  Dennis brought out the meat display and in great detail explained every cut if beef.  He also was more than happy to answer all our questions about the menu and offer suggestions.  Ben was \"Johnny on the spot\" bringing out the five varieties of bread and telling us about each one. Our beverages were refreshed throughout the meal.  \nMy husband had the ribeye and a side of spinach. It was the most tender, flavorful, well seasoned ribeye we've ever tasted. I had the beef braised ribs with pur\u00e9ed potatoes. Tender yo say the least.  We ate so slowly to savor every bite!\nDennis highly recommended the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. We are chocolate livers, but thought he hadn't led us wrong yet. And he didn't this time either.  I don't even have the words to describe how delicious it tasted. And the homemade ice cream truly complimented the pudding.\nBack to our server Dennis...he was fun, knowledgable, animated, and knew the menu inside and out. We even had a chance to talk about Gordon's TV shows.  \nWe are looking forward to our next trip to Vegas and going back to Gordon Ramsay's Steak.  HIGHLY recommend."

I was a great fan of Gordon Ramsey shows, so I was looking forward to tasting his restaurant and I also saw Christina win and be the chef of the steak house.  So when I had some out of town guests I decided to try it out.  That was a letdown.  I didn't mind the \"Stefford Wives\" hostesses even the presentation of the raw steaks which I thought rather tacky. Appetizers were good but small, we had the fried oysters (3 pieces) 1 raviolo, and Hamachi crudo the sides were not even, mac and cheese was the only good one, the mushrooms were not edible, too hard and fibrous.  Then came the entrees it was the worse steak I ever had.  Sizzler's was probably better and costs a forth of the price.  I had the 32 oz ribeye medium and tasted burned I could not eat it, I asked our arrogant waiter Freddy to change it as all I could taste was burned meat and he refused saying that is how the steaks are cooked and pointed to the pink center which he said is how I ordered it and the new steak will come out the same.  Since I had guests I did not want to make a scene. The sauce he recommended was the house made sauce which he said was the most popular but all it tasted like was A-1sauce.  Besides the steak we also ordered Beef Wellington another disappointment.  The crust was soggy with the beef blood and was so bland, we even had to ask for gravy as he did not bring any.  The Fish and Chips was ok but costs $42.  Gordon Ramsey, this was kitchen nightmare and I felt like you yelling at the chefs.  We went to Bouchon the next day to get my steak and fritte fix, they never disappoint."

This is bad because a man at the table next to us had a bit too much wine to drink, and then threw up in his napkin. He then put his napkin down on the bench beside me and I actually saw the contents (this is how I knew he threw up since the whole thing was fairly discreet up to this point). It was so awkward... my husband saw him throwing up but did not mention it to me because he did not want me to feel sick, but then I saw the napkin contents and told my husband about it. Needless to say, we both felt sick and wanted to get the heck out of there. Unfortunately, we were only part ways through eating our steak! I left the restaurant right away since I really thought I was going to be sick. My husband followed close behind, after having a chat with management. We got 50% off the bill, which was a really nice gesture. One of those situations where it wasn't their fault, but it was their problem, I guess. \n\nWe very much enjoyed our appetizers, and we were starting the enjoy the steak and sides when the incident occurred lol. \n\nOne thing I did not like about the restaurant itself was how they bring out the meat cart.

I ordered the beef wellington for my entree because this is a \"signature\" dish of his. I felt the overall beef wellington was under seasoned. It could have used a little pepper and salt. There is some salt on the steak but you need to get the perfect bite for it to compliment the steak as it should. I will say this though the mashed potatoes, carrots and parsnips were the best vegetables I have ever eaten. The sauce they serve with the dish was also great.  The vegetables were all cooked perfectly and slight al dentel. I felt my steak was also cooked very well but the overall flavor left a little to be desired.

After booking hotel and airfare, a reservation at GR Steak was the next logical step, right?! I noted that we would be celebrating our first anniversary, and it was not forgotten!\n\nWe arrived early but were immediately sat at a Chef's Table facing the kitchen. The ma\u00eetre d' wished us a happy anniversary, as did the hostess who sat us. We were promptly greeted by our server, Freddy, who also wished us a happy anniversary. He let us know that he had someone that would be helping him to (he was just as good, but I can't remember his name!). We were presented with the wine list, and the special Hell's Kitchen menu, but we both already knew what we would be ordering.\n\nI chose the Wellington - ever since Sal got me hooked on watching Hell's Kitchen, I've wanted to try the Wellington! Sal is a huge fan of a good ribeye, so naturally, he chose that. I also ordered the British Ale Onion Soup, and Sal got a side of mac & cheese. \n\nLet's just talk about the Wellington for a moment... It melted in my mouth! The meat was tender, juicy, and almost creamy. Not to mention the pastry was just perfect. Sal's Ribeye was equally as tender, cooked perfectly, and had just the right amount of seasoning to bring out the flavor of the meat, rather than mask it. Let's not forget that mac & cheese! Now, it's no secret amongst my families, I HATE PEAS! There, I said it. I don't hate them nearly as much as I hate cilantro, but still, I don't eat them. Ever. Well at GR Steak, I ate my words, and some delicious peas!\n\nUgh, now I'm hungry! On to dessert! Freddy had been raving about the Sticky Toffee Pudding, so when I asked about the \"cake\", I was pleased at how well he described it. Though he said it was more like a \"bread pudding\" I would argue that the \"cake\" is more of a prune cake type thing. Either way, the overall experience of the dessert was magnificent. That's right - I used the word magnificent to describe a dessert!\n\nBottom line, hands down, best meal I've ever had. Best service, too. Glasses were NEVER empty, servers were extremely pleasant, and the atmosphere was fun. Can't beat it. Totally worth the price for a celebration dinner!"

            "review": "Recommendation:  Make your reservation in advance.  I did not make a reservation prior to arriving in LV.  I basically saw an ad on the strip and said to myself -- we should go there.  So, I tried making a reservation online the day before and the only open spots were 10pm.  I ended up calling the reservation # the day that I wanted to go and lucked into an 8pm opening.\n\nOn the day of my reservation, I arrived on time but had to wait a bit to be seated...the place is packed!  We were seated by the kitchen in a corner of the restaurant that I'm sure was never meant to be a dining space but, it became one because of the popularity of this place.\n\nOnce seated, we did have to wait for our server.  Once he got to our table he handed us the pre-fix menu and left.  I wasn't here for pre-fix -- I don't think many people are.  After about ten minutes he was back and seemed to be upset when we declined the pre-fix and requested to see the regular menu.\n\nAlthough at a steak house, I did not order steak.  Why you ask?  Well, in my opinion steaks are really hard to mess up, especially if you use quality beef.  So, I want to see how well a non-steak dish can be put together.  To me, that is a good test of quality.  So, I went with their signature seafood dish.  This is the dish that includes 3 types of fish, scallops and the 1/2 lobster tail (petite).  The dish was OK.  To me, and this is a taste preference, it lacked seasoning (salt) and since there is no salt on the table, I could not do anything about this.\n\nI don't know about you, but when you go to a celebrity chef's place, you expect a wonderful experience.  But, I felt like the wonder was missing."

We had our anniversary dinner here when we were in Vegas and our evening was fantastic!\n\nComplimentary breads - they're so good! They are not your typical plain bread/sourdough. They are baked to perfection with stuff in it - mushroom, bacon etc. Very good!\n\nFor appetizer, we each got a piece of scallop. It melts in your mouth! So flavorful! We savored every bite!\n\nI got the infamous beef wellington. I thought it's small but wow, the portion is pretty big! And it's cooked to perfection!\n\nHusband got the steak and of course he loved it! I tried it too, and it was really good! he didnt try my beef wellington because he doesnt eat mushroom. :)\n\nAnd for our dessert: Sticky Pudding.. THE. BEST. That's all I can say! \n\nIt happened to be Caesar's 50th anniversary the day before our dinner and Gordon Ramsay was there to cut the cake! I was really hoping that he will show up at his restaurant when we were there. But no... I'm sure he was super busy to stop by. Hopefully next time I will meet him in person, such a big fan of him!"

The bartenders are very friendly and service is great.\n\nI had to get the bone marrow which is a huge portion for one person. It comes with homemade English muffin bread which was very greasy and soggy. It should have been some sort of toasted or grilled bread. \n\nThe bread selection is good too. The appetizers and salads seemed very expensive, about $15-20 each for a salad, soup? I wanted to try the foi gras but it was $25 and I already decided on the marrow.\n\nI really wanted the 24oz ribeye but that is just too much meat so I got the 18oz bone-in ny strip and it was great! Perfectly cooked and just the right size.\n\nI had the asparagus which the bartender said was one of the smaller sides and only ate about half of it. It was good but nothing extraordinary. I was too full for dessert and the menu didn't look that great. I had loose leaf tea which was nice. \n\nI would like to go back and try another steak and some more sides and apps. Overall it was very good and the steak itself was not outrageously expensive for Vegas."

You enter through Paris Hotel and Casino and there is a round Chunnel like structure, which the Door Girl explains transitions you from Paris to England.   Then she pointed out the red neon overhead light sculpture which is to simulate Gordon's hand movements while making Beef Wellington.   All kind of scripted but sets the tone that every aspect of your experience has been well thought out.   We were seated in leather high back chairs at our table.  Very comfortable.   Matthew, our server, and his  waiter assistant provided spectacular service.  We were very impressed.   The only single and very minor disappointment is that the oil drizzled bread was a bit dry.   But that is the only single negative thing we can say.   And keep in mind, there were three choices in bread so, very minor.    I was having dinner with my boss, who is a seasoned fine dinner.  She very much enjoyed herself, as did I.  We started with the pork belly.   Yum!   I decided on the fish and chips because if anyone could pull off a unique twist on fish and chips you would think it would be Ramsey.  And he did.     My boss got the short ribs which fell apart to the touch.   They were phenomenal.    We order mac and cheese as a side.   We both had to take a moment and just close our eyes to enjoy.    When our server's wait staff assistant came to clear out plates, we told him it was too soon, like after you open all your gifts at Christmas and there's wrapping paper and ribbon all over the place, you just want to relax and take it all in for a moment.   He laughed and came back later.   We didn't have room for desert but I'm sure it would have been terrific.   We drank patron margaritas and there were well portioned with alcohol.  After three we were ready for a long winter's nap.   Kudos to the staff at the restaurant.    There was one moment when I had a question and raised my hand to look for my waiter, but was quickly seen to by someone else's waiter.   He came right over to see what my need way.   Can't beat that.   He was eager to ensure our experience didn't involve any delays.   Well done."

You check in at Paris and walk through the short Tube and then you're in London. Kinda cute concept. \n\nOur waiter was fantastic. She was really attentive to the adults and to my kids needs ages 13, 11 and 9.  The issue we had was that my family got seated upstairs in a large room with many tables. There was a large group of 15 people who were screaming and swearing throughout our dinner. One man was so loud and obnoxious that we couldn't hear each other. The large group had 2-3 women who tried to keep the rest of the group in their party in check however it was futile. Once they started to drink it was game over. \n\nAnother party of 7 asked to be moved because of the loud group seating next to us. After 40 min of hearing nonsense of the man singing Brittany Spears and constant cursing we also asked to be moved. The request was made and it was the best thing we did. We got reseated  in the main dining room with a booth. They rest of the night was much better. The question I have is if the management knows that there is a loud party why not ask the other tables if they like to be reseated to another table?  Why did I have to ask to be moved?  \n\nThe food was excellent by the way. Kids had the Kobe steak. My wife ordered the Beef Wellington and I ordered the bone in ribeye. We also ordered dirty martini and a half bottle of a Cabernet.\n\nI thought this restaurant had a higher dress code however you can dine here with a shirt and shorts."

I came here with high expectations and I'm so glad there were highs and lows about my experience because I know I'm not biased about liking his food! Lol. But seriously, can a steak taste anymore divine? \n\nWe make reservations for 2, although at a 530 dinner on a Monday, definitely not necessary. We came to Paris, and the hostesses were dressed very chic and sexy. I thought they'd be in white uniforms or something. But as we are seated, I am sorry but that decor of Gordon Ramsey's \"hands\" is so ugly. Lol. Come on. That abstract art thing is better off somewhere else. We are seated and informed so well on steaks, food, specials, wines, the whole 9 yards. The complimentary bread was good. Best foccacia bread I've ever had! No joke! & the sea salt on butter was soooooo good. Great textures. \n\nFirst, why didnt they tell us they charge for stupid water? Shoot, give me tap and call it a day. The British water we tasted like spring water or a faucet...but was not worth my $9 a bottle. Which I didnt know until I paid my tab. Phooey.\n\nThe pork belly app was amazinggggg. So succulent and tender and juicy. Let me lick the skin. Haha, it was delicious. Perfect cooking. But I kinda think the sweet grits were too sweet for my liking and the other stuff on top was too sweet. Albeit the pork was phenomenal, a saltier or savory approach would have been better for me. And if they made it a crispy pork belly,  I wouldn't be mad either.\n\nThe fried oysters were also delicious. Perfectly coated and shucked well, the oysters were fresh and thinly coated but perfectly crispy. Loved the pairings with the seaweed and the sauce. Definitely appreciated the saltiness of the garnishes which really highlighted the quality of the seafood and added a salty note that was much needed for an oyster.\n\nNext, the beef rib for entree. Let me just tell you, DINOSAUR BONE! it was huge and amazingly glazed. My friend could barely eat it after all the appetizers we had. Definitely savory and worth the price. It was seriously huge!\n\nMy absolutely tender melt in your mouth, I don't wanna chew, let me swallow Beef Wellington was so dayum good. I almost died because I have never had a steak aged so beautifully, and taste so elegant and tender at the same time. The stuffing for the wellington was amazing, right amount of earthy tones and salt. The puff pastry was just okay to me, wish it was flakier. Nonetheless, the puree was perfect. Unfortunately i couldn't eat it all. But I will admit, i ate it as a midnight snack that night! Hahaha. No shame in my glutinous ways thanks to Gordon Ramsey.\n\nOverall, perfect for any occasion and it really wasn't that expensive. Our meal was a little over $200 including tip and that came with 2 (I'll never order again) bottles of water, 2 scrumptious appetizers, and 2 huge entrees, not to mention our delicious complimentary bread! Def recommend and def coming back when I am in Vegas again!!! So worth it!!"

Gordon Ramsey should be ashamed of this restaurant bearing his name - he should have been in the restaurant screaming at his staff that they were failures like you see on TV, as in this case, they were.\n\nI went to Gordon Ramsay Steak with a friend to celebrate his birthday.  Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.\n\nThe disappointment started when we were seated.  We originally had a reservation for 6 people, however only 5 showed.  Well, they seated us at a table meant for 4.  I might expect this had we brought an extra person, but we actually brought one less person than our reservation was for.  Given that this is supposed to be a high-end restaurant, that's downright unacceptable.\n\nMoving on, I was going to order a drink.  Their drink menu is on an iPad, which as a techie, I thought was neat in concept, except the menu was broken and I couldn't actually use it.  Oh well.  No drink.\n\nNext up was the appetizers.  I ordered Ravioli.  Never did I envision that when ordering Ravioli, I would get one, singular, ravioli.  Yes, it was a larger than normal ravioli, but for $13, I expected 2 or 3, not just one.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly amazing, either.\n\nOn to the main course.  The cuts of meat were good. however the side dishes were just OK.  They used butter and fat as a crutch, and weren't actually good by design - they were just buttered up to taste good.\n\nFinally the check comes.  There is a $45 cookbook on the check.  Throughout the entire night, there was never a discussion of a cookbook, we did not ask for one, the waiter did not offer one, nor did we receive one.  It's possible it could have been an honest mistake, but given how bad the experience was overall, I'm not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAfter we get the cookbook removed, the check for 5 people was a bit over $700.  No wine was ordered - that was just the cost of food.  I'm not complaining about the price (I knew it wasn't a cheap restaurant before going) - I'm complaining about how bad the food/service was given the price.  I truly believe I would have been happier had we gone to TGI Friday's and paid $700 for our meal at TGIF than here.  \n\nThis restaurant is a joke - even if I was offered a free meal there, I'm not sure I would go back.  Don't waste your time or money going here."

I complained because, like I said, we were paying so much for this 70-person party, and after my complaint (and pointing out the preset menu) they then sent out the sticky toffee pudding for every table...but most people did not try it because they had already finished the cheesecake. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding is 5 stars by itself. It is the best dessert I've ever had in my life.  I've had it other places, but what makes this one so fabulous is the butter flavored ice cream that comes with it.\n\nI will probably go back to this restaurant for the dessert every time I come to Vegas...but I won't go for steak...STK at Cosmo was better for that."

The salmon and bourbon creamed corn were also great but not too memorable in comparison to the first 4 mentioned. \n\nOur server was fantastic and my water was always filled. Add in a glass of red wine and a bottle of passion fruit tea and bf and I were so stuffed for the rest of the night. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and Gordon Ramsay Steak definitely lived up to our expectations. Will be back in the future to try their other steaks!"

My husband and I were invited to the soft opening this evening and were certainly wined and dined. The restaurant is an experience in modern fine dining. Our server greeted us with and ipad cocktail and wine menu. After we selected a few handcrafted cocktials, our server approached us with a meat cart! Yes a meat cart! We were able to select our cut from a selection of steaks displayed on a meat cart that winded throughout the restaurant tantalizing it's guests with it's succulent cuts. For the appetizer, we picked the caesar, maine lobster, and foie gras. The caesar was served with a scotch egg. The main lobster was served with chorizo broth poured tableside and foie gras was a play on a PBJ with it's cute english muffin and strawberry jam. Of course we ordered a gigantic bone-in ribeye and it was perfectly crusted and the fat was like butter. It came with red wine demi, veal demi, and home-made steak sauce. We loved it! You could tell the product was expensive and a lot of hard work went into the food. The ambiance was calm, fun, and exciting. Well done Paris! Everything jived from the uniforms to the table settings. The attention to detail was suberb. Gordon Ramsay should be proud! We will definitely be back!"

            "review": "We went to Gordon Ramsay Steak with high expectations, and I was writing the five star review in my head before even stepping foot in the restaurant, but sadly it was no better than three stars (maybe 3.5). Here are some of my observations:\n\nPros:\n- From a visual standpoint the restaurant is very chic and modern which I liked.\n\n- They give you three types of bread, and all were good.\n\n- Our waiter was excellent and recommended that I get the 8oz rib cap over the 24oz bone-in rib eye because, even though they were the same price and 24 is always better than 8 (ha), I would be spending my time cutting around the bone instead of just enjoying a quality piece of meat. He was right, the rib cap was delicious and when I asked about ordering a sauce he told me to try the steak first and order a sauce only if I felt it needed something. That was nice as he could have easily told me to order a sauce to pad the bill.\n\n- My wife's Beef Wellington was excellent, very tender and flavorful.\n\n- The sticky toffee pudding was very good. We didn't find it mind blowing like some of the other reviewers on here, but it was a nice way to end the night.\n\nCons:\n- The music is WAY too loud. I knew about this from the reviews here before coming, but I wasn't expected to be blasted by songs from the UK for two hours which made it a tad difficult to have a normal conversation.\n\n- The Hell's Kitchen tasting menu is $145/person and if you decide to order that everyone in your party has to get it. Huh? One of us would have probably tried it out, but not both of us.\n\n- Their wines by the glass are limited and I wasn't impressed with my $14 glass of cab. Disappointing.\n\n- If you're paying $$$ for a meal there is a level of expectation that service will be exemplary, but I found the service overall to be just ok. It took a bit for the bread to come out (we were there at least 15mins before being served bread), we had to refill our water glasses ourselves...it was a number of little things that added up.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the meal is that we found the steaks were salted way more than they should have been. I adore salt but after eating my steak (and some of my wife's) I felt lethargic from salt overload and we were going to skip dessert because of it, but we really wanted to try the sticky toffee pudding. Gordon Ramsay on Hell's Kitchen is always berating the chef's if they don't properly season their food, so I was surprised that they used way too much salt than was needed.\n\nWhile I'm glad I got the chance to come here for dinner because I'm a fan of watching Gordon on Hell's Kitchen, there are just too many other steak places in Las Vegas that offer a better experience for the same price. Gordon Ramsay Steak had a chance to wow me, but sadly the over-salting of the food, limited wines by the glass, and just ok service means we won't be back."

            "review": "During our recent trip to Vegas my husband and I booked our anniversary dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak for 7:00 PM on a Tuesday. We arrived on time and were told our table was not yet ready and that we could wait in the lounge. Once inside, we discovered the restaurant was quite small and the lounge packed full of people eating dinner without a reservation. There was also not an empty seat to be found at the bar nor any room to move about. We finally got lucky and snagged a dirty corner table in the lounge. After 5 minutes a waitress brought over an iPad and asked if we'd like to order drinks, but she never returned. We waited another 10 minutes and finally someone else came to fetch us and showed us to our table.\n\nWe were taken around the corner to a half booth/half table, and we might as well have joined the patrons next to us, as literally I could have reached out and helped myself to their bread basket. There was nothing intimate or romantic about this meal. The music was as loud as a nightclub and we could barely hear each other across the table from one another. We had more room and privacy at the lounge table.\n\nOnce again our server brought over the iPad and asked about drinks, and again I placed an order for $14 cocktails (Pimm's Cup). I thought it was decent and pretty strong, but my husband didn't care for it and afterward he ordered an iced tea ($7!!!) Our server drug over a huge metal pedestal cart full of the different cuts of meat, but I could not hear a word he said over the loud music. He also seemed completely checked out and had to drag that huge meat tray around to five other tables near us and give the same speech over and over. I ordered the Beef Wellingon ($54) and my husband the Duet of Lamb ($48) (lamb chop and shepherd's pie) with a side of Mac & Cheese ($13). We ordered Kobe Beef Sliders ($18) to start as we were warned the Wellington would take 45 minutes to cook. The sliders came out quickly, but were tiny (only two) albeit tasty, but ouch the price tag for only a bite each. The bread plate was also great and the sea salt butter was a nice touch.\n\nThe main courses were out of this world! The small amount of potato puree that came with the Beef Wellington was amazing. I wanted to lick the plate. The meat melted in my mouth and the pastry was delicious and flaky. I had been dying to try it being a fan of Hell's Kitchen and watching them make it every week/season. My husband's lamb chop was lovely and the shepherd's pie was quite good as well. We were both disappointed with the Mac & Cheese and quite frankly have had better elsewhere.\n\nWe followed up the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding ($14), and Oh. My. God. Life changing. I don't think I have had a better desert anywhere ever. The cake was moist, the brown butter ice cream salty and sweet, and oh that little tiny pitcher of liquid brown sugar toffee-- to die for.\n\nThe atmosphere and service of this place blows. Who wants to eat a fancy fine dining meal in a nightclub sitting basically on the lap of the person next to you in another party?! It's obvious the goal is to pack you in like a sardine and turn the table over as soon as possible. There was no personalized service or attention and we were just one of many. About five different people brought us our food, drinks, bread, etc. The patrons were in all manner of dress from tracksuits and jeans/shorts to cocktail dresses and business casual. Of course, it's Vegas so I suppose that is to be expected just odd to see in a \"fine dining\" restaurant.\n\nIn the end I have to say that the food itself almost makes up for most of the shortcomings though it seems they definitely have some kinks to work as far as getting folks seated on time, returning to take drink orders, turning the music down, and spacing out the tables. Also, there was no Gordon nor Christina to be found (just in case you were wondering). I get the feeling his name was just slapped on the marquee and she is probably rarely there for anything other than appearance sake. The pricing is also confusing. The menu online has one set of prices, but once you're actually there it is several dollars more for each item and then there is a third price if you are a Total Rewards member which we are.\n\nThis is not the kind of place for a relaxing and romantic anniversary dinner, which they made no mention of even though they asked when the reservation was made. Previously I didn't expect anything, but we had dined at Hubert Keller's Fleur the night before and the bar was set high. There we were wished a happy anniversary several times in addition to being presented with a special desert which was very impressive. Gordon Ramsay? Nada.\n\nIf this place is still open next time we're in Vegas, I'd order desert to go or possibly just eat it at the bar or in the lounge, loud music and all.. Other than that, I don't think we will drop another $200 + in this place again. Still, I gave it an extra star because the food was delicious."

The service was great (although, different people were serving me at different times, so it was difficult to keep track of who I needed to ask questions of).  I came alone and was one of the first to be seated; unfortunately, I had to watch everyone coming into the restaurant (on the right side of the restaurant as you walk in, near the kitchen).  I would have preferred a seat where I did not feel like I was at a bar or waiting to get seated during my entire meal (which lasted two hours).  The first course, the salad, was delicious (I really wanted more), the second course, the scallop risotto, was not good- the scallop was almost rubbery; I asked about it and I was told that that is the way they cook them at Steak. I was taking my time on some of the dinner (the third course, the Wellington & the dessert course, the Sticky Toffee Pudding) because they were so good; however, because I was taking my time, my food was taken away from me (I guess they assumed I was finished eating).   My favorite part of this meal was the dessert.  I am not a big dessert person when I go out to eat because they are not made to perfection.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding is indescribable- just order it if you go to Steak.  I don't see how they can mess this one up. The pairings were all well chosen, especially for desert (they paired the toffee pudding with the \"Sierra Blanca, Bone Chiller, Brown Ale, New Mexico.\"  I will go back to Steak, but I will never order the Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu again. I know there are other menu items that I can order that are better left on their own."

My boyfriend wanted to try out some true, Kobe steak and we decided that the great Gordon Ramsay couldn't disappoint.  \n\nWe headed in with a good giggle over the hostess' uniforms (black dresses, bright red lips and pocket watches as necklaces...they all looked like some weird vampire cult) and decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our (reserved) table. This only took us around ten minutes, but I was already disappointed.  Their drink menu is pretty standard, focusing on lighter, fresh drinks that pair pretty well with the heavy menu.  I was very excited to see the English Garden came with \"basil infused rock candy\", having a sweet tooth and loving herbal drinks I thought this would be fun.  Unfortunately their 'rock candy' is actually a brand of simple syrup instead of actual rock candy.  I thought this was rather underhanded. Everyone reading the menu expects actual rock candy, and I watched another girl go through the same disappointment as she got her drink. \n\nThings just continued to go downhill as we were seated.  The restaurant is rather dim and loud as other reviewers pointed out, but also they are trying to apparently cram as many people as possible into the place.  Our table for two was crammed in with several others along a bench seat.  I could barely get in (and I'm on the small side) without worrying about jostling the table next to me.  Definitely ask to be seated in one of their booths if you have the option.  I was closer to the girl seated at the next table then my boyfriend at ours.   Along with the loud music this ruined any intimate atmosphere for the dinner. \n\nOur waiter was pretty decent, but pretty inattentive all around for this level of restaurant.  I also couldn't hear half of what he said, and it was too dark and our table not set up right for us to actually see anything on their famous wheeled mirror table to show off their meat 'tableside'  (it was actually directly behind my boyfriend who was the only one interested and he couldn't even see it without getting out of his seat).  They also are very strict about only having  a tasting menu for part of the table, which I suppose makes sense in theory, but less in actual practice.  \n\nThat being said, even with me being as grumpy as I was as the meal started (I was trying to convince my boyfriend to leave), the food was phenomenal.  Everything from the delicious prosciutto bread starter (I could live off that alone for the rest of my life and be completely happy), to my beef wellington to my boyfriend's steak was absolutely perfect.  I could go on for paragraphs about the food, but I won't.  Don't come for the atmosphere, don't come for the drinks, but the food is amazing.  If you plan ahead (get a better table, skip the drinks and focus on the food), you will have a great experience."

It was delicious with some tart and some caviar to give it a slight salty flavor and it is to be eaten all in one bite. Absolutely delicious! It wetted my appetite!\n\nBeet salad was sweet and had a slight tart with capers that gave a bit briny, salty taste that balanced with creme fraiche and smoked salmon was tender and succulent\n\nHamachi crudo  - the fish melts in your mouth with the truffle cream sauce that was  savory. It was topped with caviar, truffle shavings and green apple slices. It was so good!\n\nKobe beef sliders - the meat was juicy and savory and had a nice crispy buns.\n\nFried Oyster smelled like the ocean - it had some kind of seaweed beans on the oyster. The oyster was breaded and was crunchy on the outside and nice and juicy in the center with some kind of cream sauce over it.\n\nBeef Wellington was delicious - it was stuffed with pancetta and truffles. It had a nice crust on the outside. The sides were a potato pur\u00e9e that was nice and smooth with foie gras carrots that were sweet and savory.\n\nAmerican Kobe beef with Maine lobster nice crust on the outside and tender in the inside like shredded beef with tender and succulent lobster with mushrooms.\n\nThe dining experience is very luxurious, and definitely expensive (to me!) I am just glad that I had the chance to eat GR's food. I thought the food got a bit heavy the more courses I ate and well if it is a five course meal then they should know... Right?

I loved the decor and the staff there.. but of course I also loved the food.\n\nFirst off, I have to start with the restaurant experience. The staff was not only knowledgeable about the different cuts of steak offered, but they were also very friendly in terms of making conversation. They often checked up on my table, and overall, it was a wonderful experience, especially with their \"steak cart,\" which showcases all cuts of steak.\n\nThe food itself lived up to what I imagined. My boyfriend and I shared two appetizers: kurobuta pork belly, seared foie gras and a maine lobster. The pork belly and foie gras are all MUST HAVES, but the lobster, although delicious, can be found in other high-end restaurants. I had the beef wellington and in my opinion, it was cooked most tenderly with the pastry outside perfectly made. My boyfriend ordered the American skirt steak, which was unfortunately a little dry. Our stomachs couldn't make room for dessert but we did have a spoonful of their sticky toffee pudding and boy, it was heavenly! It's probably something that two people could share though because the table for two next to us couldn't finish theirs.\n\nNext time, I think I'm going to try the tasting menu because you also get to bring home a signed photograph of Ramsay!\n\nPsst - try their cocktails. Primm's Cup was fantastic.\nOh - and a special shoutout to Charles Narak, the kindest, funniest and friendlist waiter I've ever met! Charles really added to the Gordon Ramsay dining experience."

Dim lights, nice tables and the waiters and waitresses dress nice. It was quite impressive. \nAs far as the appetizers, we got a wedge salad and cauliflower soup. Salad was light and fresh and soup was great with the bay scallops and curry. \nI decided to get Beef Wellington and my wife got the American Filet which costs more than regular filet because it's Wagyu. \nSo, the American Filet was nothing to rant about. My wife ate all of her steak but was dissatisfied. I tasted it myself and felt the same way. Her first thought was, \"Flemings was BETTER\". Yes everybody. Flemings. The American Wagyu was not at all tender as it should be and the flavor was mediocre. \nThe Beef Wellington was not to my liking either I actually only took about 4 bites and it was all I can take. The beef tenderloin was very tender and the puff pastry was good. What turned this entree into my disappointment was the fact that the beef was cold. Not warm. Cold. The flavor was ok. It really just tasted like raw meat. What a bummer. The fingerling potatoes and Mac and cheese is what I had to eat to fill myself. The potatoes were great and the Mac n cheese with peas was pretty good too. I was so dissatisfied with my meal I decided to try his desert and the sticky toffee pudding is to die for!! Every bite was moist, sticky and hot. The small slab of vanilla ice cream was a nice companion for it. They went together well.  \nSo I can only give this restaurant 2 stars. The steak and Wellington was not very good & we didn't even drink alcohol.....the bill was $254 plus the tip.....$300\nSo dissatisfied."

The service really is outstanding in my experience. My first visit, we had a party of six and there was almost always a server there in about a 2 and a half hour dinner. I don't know a great deal about wine and asked the server what he recommended to pair with myWe sat in the upstairs dining area which I felt was fairly cramped - not terrible. However, there was a table for two next to us that turned over 3 times while we were there, so it's a very busy place.\n\nI've ordered the Beef Wellington both times I've been there. It's their signature dish and I had to try it. It was perfectly cooked a juicy medium rare and the pastry was fresh and flaky just the way it should be. It's served with a potato puree that's delicious as well. Both times I was temped by the Ribeye. It's a monster of a steak. A friend ordered it and enjoyed it very much and reported that it was among the best and it was cooked exactly as he'd ordered it. However, for me, the Wellington is the perfect amount of food. I rarely ever eat all of a meal at a restaurant and almost always take something home or am hungry when I leave. However, with sides, it was not only an excellent meal, but perfectly filling. The only drawback is that you have to wait about 45 minutes for them to prepare it. Nevertheless, the complementary bread and appetizers will keep you busy.\n\nAs for sides, I had to get the Mac and Cheese and potato puree. They're great complements to the steak. I also ordered an a la carte lobster tail that was small but very good. They provide you with a variety of breads which are all pretty good as well. \n\nFinally, I never order dessert, but was convinced to order the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I have to admit it was incredibly good. Even if you're not a person who likes sweets very much, I highly recommend it. The sauce it comes with is amazing as well as the ice cream that tastes like butter. However, I'd never be able to eat one to myself as it's incredibly rich.\n\nAll in all, I really like Gordon Ramsay's Steak. Sure, it's incredibly hyped and full of tourists, but it is solid. I would definitely go by their recommendations as a first time visitor. The servers won't steer you wrong and you'll end up with a great experience."

I think it's great that Gordon is done with the show and should come here to fix his own place.\n\nHad reservations months in advance, showed up on time and were seated upstairs. We did let the waiter know two things: one- we drink tons of water and two- we have a show to make (hence why we made early Sat eve reservations).\n\nAs we sat there and sat some more, no water. After asking 3 people for some water finally get some after 15 minutes. The place seems in unreal chaos while wait staff, management and hostesses (in very non-classy dresses) run around like chickens with their heads cut off. The place has cool d\u00e9cor but not very great noise absorbent set-up, hence why you cannot even hear yourself think let along carry on a conversation with anyone you happen to dine with.\n\nWe finally ordered some cocktails from our waiter who seemed to be as pretentious and fake as I have seen them, and chatted with the Sommelier- which turned out to be part waiter, part Sommelier and the best part of our experience in this restaurant.\nWe ordered Brunello and waited. No bread, water glasses empty, no waiter, nothing. So we asked few more people for more water. No drinks. Then the Sommelier brings our wine- we yet to see our cocktails so I finally asked him- so he runs for the cocktails.\n\nThen our waiter is finally back, takes our order and we ask for more water once again. The appetizer came out with our cocktails so we had no time to enjoy them pre-dinner. Then the salad came- about as blah beet salad I have had anywhere in the world. Then we wait some more. And keep asking for water and had to ask the Sommelier for bread as our waiter could care less.\n\nWe finally get the entr\u00e9es, lamb trio and tuna. Tuna was good but the lamb was way overcooked and salty and the baked potato looked like has been about a week old and reheated so many times the skin was about quarter inch thick and very dry. At this point we are in the restaurant for almost 2 hours with lousy meals and service so finally called the manager. Tracy (not sure on the spelling) was absolutely unprofessional, agreed that the lamb is overcooked and that the potato should not left the kitchen and simply barked that he will take care of the meals. No apologies, no explanation, was clearly not interested in having a conversation with a paying customer and frankly his attitude was: \"there are others at the door\". So when I told him that in a place like this, I waited two hours and this is the quality and customer service we receive, his reply was \"you are the first to complain tonight\"......even after he saw and agreed on the quality (or lack of there) of food. \n\nSo Dear Mr. Gordon Ramsay, growing up around restaurant business, traveling around the world and eating in many high- end places, I would strongly suggest that your Tracy (sp) manager gets fired on the spot as he is a sorry excuse for a restaurant manager (to let something like his reply out of his mouth) and will only turn more of your clients away. I would also suggest that your staff gets better training in customer service, timing on cocktails, wine and dinner courses and overall this place clearly needs new management as we always know- the issues come from the top as staff is only following/reacting to what they know. Lastly, two toilets in ladies' room for two  story restaurant with hundreds of seats is barely sufficient from a hygiene standpoint."

The restaurant is in the Paris Hotel which is nice. We got there a bit early (8:30) for our 9:00 reservation and let the hostess know. She said it would be another 15 minutes and that we should wait at the bar. We decided to walk around instead and came back at 8:45. The same hostess says it will be another 15 minutes and again directs us to the bar. We walked around  until 9:00. The hostess says it will be a few more minutes as they are setting up the table before disappearing in the back. You can guess where she tried to send us before leaving. 10 minutes later, she reappears surprised to see that we haven't given up and gone to the bar. All the while there are 5 or 6 snobby hostesses just standing there.\n\nOk Vegas restaurants, listen up,.... pissing off your customers right off bat by lying to them about how long the wait will be as a weak-sauced ploy to get them to buy some $18.00 foo foo drinks at your bar is not a good start. Another hostess finally walked us in through the \"London Tunnel\" and pointed out the obnoxious red neon chaos on the ceiling (supposed to represent Chef Ramsey's hand movements). There was some loud 80's music playing and the decore looked like a club scene from Scarface.\n\nWe went with the basics since this is a steakhouse. My wife ordered the foie gras appetizer and I got the lobster stuffed with chorizo. The foie gras was ok, but it needed something else to balance the dish. My lobster was good but strange as appetizer (imagine tiny lobster tail with carrots). The entrees were the 8 oz wagyu eye and the 24 oz ribeye. The wagyu was good but the ribeye was flat and basic. Not what I was expecting. We finished the meal with a sticky toffee cake that was very good. Probably the best part of the meal. Overall, this place needs to lose the 5 snobby hostesses and 80's Studio 54 decor to focus on the food."

It was me, my husband and my brother and sister-in-law (who were visiting from Europe). The restaurant has a cool, open layout with a crazy art piece in the middle of it. We sat upstairs and had to walk up some steep stairs (they DID offer us to take the elevator). The table was nice and big and we sat at a round both. \n\nThe service was kinda slow. They walk around with a big tray of meat on it to display what you have to choose from, and it kinda slows everything down. \n\nFor appetizers we had a salad, gnocci and sliders. All 3-4'ish stars. For entree my husband opted for the famous beef wellington, I had a file and I can't remember what my brother and SIL had. Some type of steak. The food was all 4'ish stars I would say. Not better than any other fancy steakhouse we've visited in Orang County. We had some wine and a TON of water (they keep pouring it for you). The water bottles were  like $10 each! \n\nI wasnt overly impressed with our visit. My brother and SIL have been to some of Gordons restaurants in London and said they actually liked those restaurants better. It all came to a 3/4 star overall rating. The food was good, but not mind-blowing. It kinda feels like you overpaid for the food because of Ramseys name."

We also had the flagship 5 course meal and while the quantities as stated were small, the taste sensations were unbelievable. The pace of the courses is just right to enjoy the decadence of each, cleanse your pallet and enjoy the ambiance. I left feeling content not stuffed. The signature course also comes with a menu card and autographed picture of Chef Ramsay in a hard backed black envelope. Another great touch that just solidifies why he has attained the status he has. Thanks to all the Chefs and staff for a great evening!"

I was initially hesitant to come to a place with a celebrity chef's name plastered all over it. But in retrospect, that should've made my decision easier as there is a level of quality that one should come to expect attached to Gordon Ramsay's name. Here are the highlights:\n\n1) You NEED a reservation. At least 2 weeks in advance. This place is continually booked solid.\n2) You'll be getting the American Rib Cap. Nice marbling. Fatty. Tender. Top of the line.\n3) You'll be drinking the HK Antioxidant if you're a girl, and the vesper if you're a guy.\n4) You'll be starting with the Foie Gras. You cannot opt out of this, please just trust me. Some of the best foie gras I've had.\n5) For your sides, you'll be having the mac & cheese and the sriracha broccoli with poached egg. Broccoli sounds lame, but this is some of the best broccoli ever!! Bypass the asparagus.\n6) You'll be finishing with the sticky toffee pudding, and THIS IS A MUST. You have to be cognizant throughout your meal that dessert will be coming up and you have to make sure you've designated enough room in your belly for the last part of the meal.\n\n\nEnjoy!! Gordon Ramsay does not disappoint. This is not just another celebrity chef establishment, it is good stuff :)"

When my husband and I walked up to the desk, we were hardly greeted and treated like we were an inconvenience. I almost wanted to leave right then, especially since it was our 11th wedding anniversary and we were really excited to be at this restaurant. It was a poor way to start out, but our server was excellent and made us feel welcome, so it turned it around for us. \n\nThe bread assortment that comes with your meal is some of the best bread I've ever tasted. We had the beef wellington, seafood plate (forgot the exact name), and the macaroni and cheese. The beef wellington had a very rustic flavor and the meat melted in my mouth. The seafood was all delicious. The mac and cheese was the best I've ever had; It has blue cheese in it, which is something I normally don't like, but it was amazing in this dish. We had planned on getting the sticky toffee pudding, but we were too full. There were some sweet ladies next to us who offered to share some with us and it was amazing! And we didn't even try it with the ice cream. We can't wait to go back one day and hopefully we can give it a 5 the next time.\n\nIf you are looking for a quiet restaurant this is not the place for you."

For the most part we were not disappointed, until we went to Gordon Ramsay Steak on our last evening in town.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes prior to our 9pm reservation (which we had made 2 months in advance).  The hostess didn't bother to look up from her book when we checked in with her.  She rudely pointed out that we were early and that we'd be seated at our reservation time.  We proceeded to the bar where we had a few beers.  Our bartender was very warm and attentive (the only good part of the visit).  While at the bar we watched many couples/groups come in after us that were seated after a minimal wait.  At 9:30 I checked in with the hostess again.  She once again did not look up from her book and simply told me we'd be seated once our table was ready.  At 9:45 we had still not been seated (again, our reservation was for 9pm).  I can certainly understand a wait at a restaurant, but I didn't appreciate that everyone around us was being seated and we were not.  We asked the bartender to close our tab and we were prepared to leave.  However, she went and spoke to the hostess and all of a sudden our table was ready.  We contemplated leaving anyway, but decided to stay.  We were seated upstairs and, to my surprise, there were many empty tables.  \n\nOnce seated it took our server another 20 minutes to show up.  Before placing our order my husband mentioned having a food allergy.  To be clear, he never asks for a plate to be modified, he simply asks if the dish he is ordering is safe for him to eat, so that otherwise he can order something else.  The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to deal with this.\n\nAt the end of the day my husband had a filet and i had the short ribs.  My husband was impressed with his meal, but my short ribs were very gristly.  Unfortunately though, it really wouldn't have mattered if the food had been mind-blowing.  Poor service is just unacceptable to me, especially at an expensive restaurant.  We just wanted to get out of there, so we finished our meals and left, no dessert.\n\nWe had been so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay Steak, I wish it had been different.  We were treated like we should have been grateful to eat there.  We will not be going back.  Too many great options in LV to put up with this nonsense."

I knew that I most likely would not get to see him, but that this restaurant should portray his hard assed attitude and what he expects from any restaurant.  It does!  The loud music kind of took me by surprise, but I liked it.  It made the place seem a little less stuffy.  The wait staff deserves all of the stars that I have given this place!!  All I have to say is WOW!  A crumb didn't hit the table without being swept away, a drink of water didn't go unnoticed and was followed with a topped off water glass immediately.  One of my group reluctantly sent a steak back which had a butter poached lobster tail beside it.  He had taken a couple of bites of that before noticing the undercooked steak. Not only was there an onslaught of apologies, but when the steak returned, there was a new lobster tail. While he waited he was brought a plate to eat the side item, a baked potato, which he received a new one once the entre returned. \n\nWe did go into this with very little expense spared. We had appetizers, a bunch of sides, the best entries, paired with great, (not the best), wine, and finished off with the signature dessert.  Our bill for four of us was over $600.00 before the tip.  \n\nAnd finally a couple of finishing notes;  Book a reservation at least a week in advance, order the truffle mac and cheese, (I can't stress that enough), and try a dessert with the French pressed coffee. \n\nThis place is quite friendly.  Not so uppity like other high end restaurants that I've been in.  The staff made all of us feel very comfy and welcomed."

We were vacationing in Vegas for the first time and just had to visit one of Ramsey's restaurants. I picked this one because they served dishes from Hell's Kitchen. However, the dishes could only be ordered from a tasting menu, a very expensive menu. I think about $145 per person. Ridiculous. \n\nI had the Market Green Salad. Not impressed. I had to get the beef wellington. It was delicious. My husband got the American Rib Cap. That was also really good. No dessert. We were too full. But I didn't find the dessert list that interesting.\n\nI didn't like was the fact that we couldn't order the risotto because it was on the tasting menu. If you're going to serve dishes from Hell's Kitchen, why force us to order everything else on that menu and pay $145 per person? Also, lobster capellini was not on the list.  \n\nI found it weird that they brought out the steaks to show us what they looked like before we ordered. Seemed a bit cheesy. The decor wasn't all that great.\n\nThe Yelp review says attire is Dressy but there were people there in jeans...\n\nHowever, the food was great. Service was great. I'm not sure I would return unless they lower the price on the Hell's Kitchen menu."

The dessert was absolute heaven.  Do yourself a favor and order the Sticky Tofee pudding with brown butter Ice Cream.  This is the best dessert I have ever tasted.  The place plays music from all decades and all of them are classics, which just adds to the ambiance.  There is a reason this place will do 25 million in it's first year in business.

            "review": "Gordon Ramsay Steak has been high on my list of Las Vegas restaurants to try since it opened last year, when I sampled Ramsay's delicious beef wellington at the Vegas Uncork'd Grand Tasting. Ramsay has more than two dozen restaurants around the world now, ranging from Michelin three-star to mediocre. However, his steakhouse has garnered consistently strong reviews over the past year, so I anticipated a meal closer to the former (not that this restaurant has 3-star ambitions though). My dad's dined here before and enjoyed it, but this would be the first trip for the rest of our family.\n\nThe USDA Prime steaks are from noted butcher Pat LaFrieda, dry aged a minimum of 28 days in a Himalayan salt room. The marbling (and pricing) moves up from there with a selection of both American wagyu and true Japanese wagyu. Each cut is on display at the onset of the meal, with the exception of the Japanese wagyu. If asked though, they will bring out the beautifully-marbled piece of cow.\n\nEven though we had a late reservation, many of us were still full from lunch at the aptly named Bacchanal Buffet. Still, my mother couldn't get enough of this bread, even requesting a second batch. Walnut, pancetta, mushroom-truffle, and foccacia made up the selection.\n\nHamachi Crudo granny smith apple, iberico ham gelee, domestic caviar, perigord truffle - Our meal began with this light appetizer with an all-star cast of ingredients. I didn't get too much of the iberico ham gelee flavor, but the tender fish was definitely tasty with the salinity of the caviar and earthines of truffle.\n\nSmoked Beef Tartare lemon zest, red onion, capers, guinness infused mustard seeds, yukon gold herb chips - Loved the presentation of this dish, with the smoke aroma making it all the way to the table. Indeed a slight smokiness imbued the raw beef, complemented by the heat of the mustard seeds. The lemon zest and red onions helped to brighten up the bites, while potato chips obviously provided the texture.\n\nRoyal Long-Bone Chop for two, 32oz - My dad and I split this bone-in ribeye. Cooked just right with a crusty sear and pink, medium-rare interior, the meat was very tender and juicy. However, I didn't get as much of a beefy depth of flavor as I anticipated. Very good, but not great (for $98, I wanted great).\n\nRoasted Beef Wellington glazed root vegetables, potato pur\u00e9e, red wine demi glace - My mother and brother went for the beef wellington for two, which didn't share the same presentation as the ribeye. It just looked like two single orders. The wellington was as I remembered, with an earthy mushroom filling complementing the relatively-mild flavor of the tenderloin. Cooked just right. A flaky crust wrapped up each bite, while the red wine demi glace added a ton of flavor as well.\n\nAmerican Wagyu Rib Cap 8oz - My dad tried this cut last time and wanted to get an order to share for the table. Indeed, the ribeye cap is becoming a very trendy cut of beef nowadays. This American wagyu first came to our table devoid of any pink; the restaurant's second try yielded a rare-medium rare. As expected, this was an excellent piece of meat, with a fatty richness that really defines the ribeye cap. However, my dad remembered it being more stand-out last time.\n\nLoaded Baked Potato smoked gouda b\u00e9chamel, sour cream, bacon, chives - This potato was huge! It was done well, with a fluffy, steaming-hot interior melting the cheese and sour cream. Add some bacon lardons, and these were some rich bites. Pretty tasty.\n\nChocolate Layers chocolate cake, passion fruit ganache layers, dark chocolate gianduja ice cream - Flavors of chocolate and hazelnut were the primary profiles here, complemented by just a bit of passion fruit.\n\nCaramel \"Banoffee\" banana toffee tarts, chocolate creameaux, coffee ice cream, cocoa nib, cotti thyme - Served warm, this dessert had a very flaky pastry with strong banana and caramel/toffee flavors. I really liked the combination of flavors, and the hot-cold from the pastry and coffee ice cream really worked well.\n\nOur meal at Gordon Ramsay Steak was very good, though fell short of very high expectations. Maybe my expectations were unrealistically high, but I found the ribeye to be missing a little more of the beefy depth of flavor, and the inconsistency of the ribeye cap was a concern. And while the appetizers were much stronger than the average steakhouse, they weren't altogether that memorable. Still, this has to be one of the best steakhouses in the city and a reliably good meal."

We ordered a few things to share. What was really thoughtful and a great idea was that the kitchen prepared everything as separate portions so that we didn't need to divide the dishes ourselves. \n\nService 5/5\nService was excellent! There was a lot of staff, but they all had a purpose. There was one person just refilling everyone's water, another clearing table, and folding napkins. I did sometimes seem to get real busy with so many staff. The sommelier came over to the table to ask what we were eating and recommend a wine. This was another great touch! The manager was also walking around making sure that everyone was enjoying themselves.\nThe atmosphere had a good vibe to it. We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was very busy. Everyone around us seemed to be having a great time.\n\nFood 4.5/5\nOur waiter was friendly, and we got a brief tutorial on the different cuts and types of steak the restaurant serves. Having the steak cut examples as a visual, really helped. This is one of the few restaurants I've been to that does this. \n\nWe got some free bread to start off the meal, which was great. For appetizers ordered the Hamachi Crudo. This was delicious light and delicate, the garlic puree was not overpowering. The Hamachi was soft and melted in your mouth. My boyfriend who usually dislikes garlic loved this dish. We also had to potato and octopus salad. The dish was nicely balanced and I really enjoyed the potatoes and vinaigrette. The appetizers were delicious.\n\nFor mains we ordered the American Rib Cap. The steak was well cooked, and tender, and the marbling on the beef gave it a fatty richness to the steak; however I thought it was way too salty for me. This was the only dish that I didn't enjoy as much. We got the beef wellington and it was yummy and AMAZING! The pastry was light and crispy, and the steak was tender and juicy. The vegetables and the potato puree were tasty. They helped cut the richness of the wellington, worked well with the meat. I loved the red wine demi-glace. I can see why this dish is Gordon's signature dish, it was lovely. They served both mains at the same time, which was great however by the time we finished the beef wellington the rib cap had gotten a bit cold. \n\nSadly I was too full to try any of the desserts. Overall we had lovely experience here. We had a couple of disappointing meals before this and I am glad this lived up to expectations."

The steaks came out lukewarm, so our waiter promptly took them back for a quick toss on some heat.  It came back hotter, but the taste was very bland.  After telling our server, he offered another steak, but we both declined,  however he still brought out another cut to my husband.  It was ok, but really not anything special.  In all honesty I was a tad bothered we were still charged for one steak as I felt that if we declined another dish and it's brought anyway, you shouldn't be charged.

Our group (2 couples) could not stop talking about the dinner the next day. \n\nI've been wanting to Gordon Ramsey's Beef Wellington for a while now. So I knew it would be my entree for the evening. Let me say it lived up to they hype. It was truly amazing, perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Every bite was just as good as the last. \nIf you on the fence about trying it, just do it. Trust me you won't be disappointed. \n\nOkay on to the rest of the meal. For appetizers we ordered the gnocchi and a Wagyu (from Japan) beef. \nBoth of them were great, I ordered the Wagyu for the table because I've lived in Kobe Japan before and wanted the group to experience the true Japanese beef with out having to take the flight. The beef was perfect and was on par with steak houses in Kobe. \nThe gnocchi was small light portion, perfect appetizer size, which was great since eating a lot of gnocchi can leave you with that too full feeling. \n\nFor the main courses my wife got the salmon and our other friends each got the filet. All were cooked exactly how they were ordered and were delicious, everyone was happy with their choices. \nAs sides we split the mac & cheese and potato pur\u00e9e. The side were a good portion for sharing but we may have needed to order two Mac & cheese because everyone kept going back for me.\n\nBy the end of the meal I was pretty full but since it was Valentine's Day we had to get dessert. We had the chocolate lava cake which I did not try but heard was great. We also ordered the sticky toffee pudding. Wow this dessert was awesome, I am not a huge dessert eater but I could not stop eating this. The brown butter ice cream went perfect with the cake like toffee. \n\nOverall we had a great dining experience, the drinks were great, services was great and food was amazing. There are so many great restaurants in Vegas but I will definitely be coming back to Gordon Ramsey Steak."

            "review": "Ok This is my first yelp review so bare with me...so this was my first time here @ Gordon Ramsay Steak and in Vegas for that matter... I have to start with my reservation was originally for 5:45 but after walking around for hours in the casino I asked the hostess if she could get us in early which was right around when they opened @ 4:30..  She was very nice and gave us a table.. Inside is very nice very clean and I love the way they set up the booths which is where we were seated.. They are set up so every other table is well like this ~~~~~~~~ Anywho, Donnie and Mohomad were our servers... They were both very nice and attentive. Great service from both of them!!! \n  So I had the onion soup which was very good along with Rib Eye steak with potato pur\u00e9e .. Have to say was one of the BEST steaks I've ever had... \n\nMy girlfriend had the Caesar salad and signature beef Wellington she enjoyed them both.. We then shared the infamous Sticky Toffee Pudding with brown butter ice cream and WOW loved it!!!  My only complaint would be $17 for a Caesar salad that was literally 5 lettuce leaves with croutons and shaved parm.. that's a little ridiculous I think... Other than that everything was great!! Thanks to Donnie & Mohomad!!"

I ordered the HK Antioxidant cocktail, the American Skirt Kobe, and the Mac & Cheese. The drink was fantastic, as was the steak. It was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful flavor. The Mac & Cheese was unique, but delicious. The bread they brought out before the meal was amazing as well. The service was top notch, although that's what I would expect for the size of the bill."

I tried the infamous Beef Wellington. All of them raved about their huge 24oz Rib Eye.  My Beef Wellington was very good as well. The meat was very tender that it almost melts in your mouth. The red wine sauce reduction was a great compliment to the dish. We also tried the following side dishes:\n\nFingerling Potatoes (4 Stars)\nMac and Cheese (4 Stars)\nGreen Beans with Citrus Aioli Sauce (5 Stars)\nSaut\u00e9ed Mushrooms (4 Stars)\nBaked Potato (4 Stars)\n\nMy bf also ordered the Bone Marrow which was really rich but he enjoyed it a lot. Good thing he didn't have a stroke after eating it. \n\nLast but not the least we tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. Wow! It was addictingly great especially with the ice cream. Make sure you save some space for this when you visit this steakhouse.\n\nI guess I'm giving them 4 stars since the service was extremely slow. We were here at 7:15pm and left at almost 10pm. We only ordered the main entree and dessert and it took forever for it to arrive. Also, they were not very attentive in refilling our drinks."

Custard in the bottom of the bow with lump crab meat & caviar, they poured green liquid from a pitcher into the bowl. Just divine... I want it now. Ordered the rib eye - delish and the welli - great. Ordered potato puree and roasted corn with cilantro lime butter -  corn has a new meaning for me as I am not usually a fan but the waiter recommended it to accompany the Wellington  it was great\n\nUnfortunately we didn't have room for dessert. \n\nThis place treats you like you are special and they are glad to wait on you. The whole experience was wonderful - worth the price tag. We will return!!"

Our waiter disappeared shortly after our cocktails were delivered (we did not see him again until our meal was over which was about an hour and 15 minutes later). We ordered the Welington, Boned in Ribeye, cream spinach and fingerling potatoes. The sides out shined our entrees. My husband favored the spinach and I the potatoes. For a 175 dollar meal + tips, 3 stars is being generous."

            "review": "This was a quintessential Vegas experience, and I don't mean that in a good way. Unfortunately Gordon Ramsey isn't living up to all the hype surrounding his shows. \n\nMy husband and I had Kobe beef slider appetizer, the ribeye with fingerling potatoes and the beef Wellington with a Sierra Nevada and a glass of wine to wash it all down. I think the best thing I had all night was the wine and the sliders. They added mustard seed to the buns for an interesting, intense flavor and the meat was juicy. The wine was $28 for the glass so I'm happy I liked it. The ribeye was just okay. Not what u would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. It was cooked to specification but not incredibly flavorful. In fact my husband had to ask for a side if salt and pepper in order to finish it. Not impressed for more than $50. My beef Wellington was also cooked to specification and flavorless. I needed a side of Dijon mustard to get it down. It was okay, but again, nothing memorable. For the price we paid I felt like I was in my own personal nightmare (no pun intended). The fingerling potato side was nice but certainly not worth the $12 price tag. \n\nAll in all it was a typical Vegas experience. A lot of glam and glitz followed by an empty wallet and buyers remorse. The sooner I forget this experience the better."

            "review": "I decided that I'd take myself out to one upscale restaurant during my stay in Las Vegas, and after some careful research landed on Gordon Ramsay Steak. I think I made a great decision.\n\nThe restaurant itself was full, so I was sat in the bar, where they serve the full menu. As a solo diner, I think this was actually a better place to be: the atmosphere was lively and friendly. My server was attentive and helpful.\n\nI started with a Vesper, the classic James Bond Martini, which was well-balanced and one of the better-mixed cocktails I've ever had. A selection of breads followed, which were all delicious, even if some fell into the all-too-American trap of being too sweet. They were accompanied by \"Devonshire butter\", which made me chuckle, but it was undeniably a delicious way to begin. These were signals: I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nMy appetizer made me cry. Sounds pretentious, I know, but I actually shed a tear. It'd been a very hard year, and this moment of luxury was a catalyst to begin letting go: a single raviolo, filled with ricotta and jamon, and an egg, such that when I cut into it the egg burst and mixed with the ingredients to make a fine sauce. Brown butter, watercress and edible flowers all added delicate notes to the flavor. It was more than the sum of its parts, and I couldn't begin to understand how it had been put together. A surprisingly emotional piece of pasta.\n\nThe steak was ... steak: a high quality piece of meat, perfectly cooked. I followed the advice of reviews I'd read and didn't bother with the sauces, because I knew the meat would stand on its own. (I'd hazard to guess that, had I chosen a sauce, it might have made me cry all over again.) I lingered over it. At some point, I swapped my Vesper for a Drifter, mixed with their own proprietary whisky, which added its own complementary note.\n\nAnd then, sticky toffee pudding. I grew up in Britain, and have had my fair share of these - but this eclipsed them all. The ice cream (more brown butter) perfectly offset the sauce and the pudding, while the pudding itself wasn't cloying or stodgy. This is a miracle for a British pudding.\n\nI didn't want it to end. When it did, and I stumbled through the neon tunnel back into the smoky reality of Paris, Las Vegas, nothing quite seemed the same."

We ordered the Alaskan Halibut and Wild Pacific Salmon entrees with sides of parmesan potatoes and mac and cheese.  All tasted as delicious as they were presented and prepared.  Our dinner waiter was experienced and very personable however our prior lounge service was slow and our waitress lacked enthusiasm.  I'm assuming she was just overwhelmed and stressed, as this was the first Mon after opening weekend.  We had a 9:15 reservation and had to wait for about 30 min. before our table was ready.  Gave us a chance to check out the wine list on the iPad while sipping a nice strawberry martini in the lounge.  Dinner was excellent and our only issue from the evening was getting charged for 4 drinks instead of 2 when they were transferred over from the lounge.  We noticed the error and our waiter had it adjusted immediately.  I'm sure those little glitches will improve over time and the food and wait was well worth it.  I'm looking forward to sampling more menu items next time we get back here...the steak perhaps!"

            "review": "Four of us went to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We got a reservation for 9:15pm on a Saturday night, which was good timing in Vegas. We arrived a little early so we had a drink in the lounge. All four of us were a little surprised of the ambiance - not what we were expecting for Ramsay. It's as if he was struggling with creating a great dinner atmosphere with a Vegas night club.  The decor looks very similar to what you see on his tv show, but some of the neon lights and bumping rave music was a little bizarre to us.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and they sat us at a great table near the kitchen.  It was a pretty busy weekend so the waiter was very apologetic about things being slow. However, none of us really felt as if the service was slow at all. They rolled out the table of steaks and the waiter did a great job at explaining all of the cuts.  We each ordered the following: a NY strip, a Porterhouse chop, and two rib-caps.  The Porterhouse is 32oz. but our friend was able to plow through that - so only order if you are big eater!  The staff brought the Porterhouse out when it was cooked to show us what it looked like prior to slicing - we appreciated that. The NY strip was 18 oz. and definitely a good size. Our friend had a little difficulty finishing it. My husband and I ordered the rib-cap. Okay, I actually didn't know they made a cut such as this. I love a rib-eye steak, but sometimes the cut is too big, over 20 oz.  However the rib-cap is actually an 8oz. cut of the most tender (and best marbled) part of the rib-eye. So for me it was an absolute hit. I got my rib-eye (the best part of it) in only 8oz. which was more than enough. My husband who usually doesn't enjoy a lot of marbling in his meat, got this as well and also thought it was amazing. One of the best steaks we've ever had.\n\nWe ordered three sides and had some leftovers: Pureed potatoes, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts with bacon. The potatoes and mac/cheese were amazing but very rich. I had ordered the brussel sprouts because those are usually my favorite side dish - but not so much here. The bacon was undercooked as were the sprouts. I usually like my bacon very crispy and cut into little pieces for this dish. Instead, there were large thick pieces of bacon that looked steamed rather than sauteed or fried. The sprouts were underdone too.\n\nDessert...For my husband's birthday they brought out the sticky toffee pudding cake and brown butter ice cream: TO DIE FOR. We shared it as a table and it was more than enough for all of us. This is definitely worth getting.\n\nFabulous staff, service and food - so why the four stars rather than five?\nIt was so loud in that place that we couldn't even hear our waiter.  I don't mind noisy and fun, upbeat restaurants, but this brought it to a new level. Someone else had commented on this in a review and I remember thinking that they were overreacting - uh, no. It really was way too loud. My throat hurt after I was screaming/talking to my friends at the table or asking the staff to repeat themselves because we couldn't hear them.\n\nOverall, it was a fun time and a perfect place for celebrating with friends."

So when I first hear he was finally opening up a restaurant here in fabulous Las Vegas, I was delighted!\n\nThe restaurant itself sits inside of the Paris hotel (how fitting) and the entrance serves as a tunnel into London and transforms into the bar/lounge area. Going further in to the right is the expansive yet nicely spaced dining room. Above the room hangs some type of abstract art resembling Ramsay as he cooks in the kitchen. Don't ask me to explain further, I'm still trying to figure out the piece myself.\n\nWhen you're seated and placing your order, a stainless steel cart of meat comes rolling by. All prime cuts served in the restaurant are displayed and your server thoroughly explains the desired cut and preparation. Fancy, I know.  I must say I commend any and all servers who studies their menus. It certainly allows the diner to trust your recommendations.\n\nI've been there twice now and both times, the service has been superb. I've ordered the French onion soup and lobster chorizo to start. Both divine. The onion soup had a nice bite at the end which cuts the richness of the broth. I love lobster and this appetizer keeps you wanting more. So succulent and cooked to perfection. I could even do without that chorizo.\n\nMy main courses consisted of the bone-in rib-eye, Kobe rib cut and beer braised short ribs.  The boyfriend had the rib-eye and the marbling was near perfection. An even amount of fat running through to deliver the most tender cut yet. I had the rib cut and the server wasn't lying, the fat content truly made the meat rich. I'm not one to be able to eat a whole slab of meat in one sitting. So seeing as the cut was less than 8 oz, I thought I'd be able to go\nfinish it. I thought wrong. although it was delicious, it was just too much for me.  The braised short ribs were melt in your mouth divine. Smothered over mashed potatoes...the creamy combination of goodness took me by surprise.  One of my favorite dishes.\n\nLast but not least, dessert. Never can I leave a dining experience without a sweet ending. And a beautiful ending it was. The sticky toffee pudding. Oh my *!!! If I've used the word divine too many times already, I apologize. It was heaven! Scrumptious glob of brown that looks more like bread. But when you cut into it, that sweet, moist, warmth takes over. Ahhhhhh like an orgasm in your mouth. Truly!\n\nOk maybe I got ahead of myself. Sorry again. I'll just end it by saying, go to Ramsay's Steakhouse, it's worth it, even just for that pudding. ;)"

There were open seats at the bar and we were given the option to sit there and wait for a table.\n\nWe got there and learned soon after that we could sit at the bar and order food. Uh, YES. Jeff had some fish and chips while I had a - wait for it - duet of lamb.\n\nWhat? WHAT? I DIDN'T ORDER STEAK?? I know! I figured steak will always be there but I had never had fancy presented food before and I'm not exactly sure how fancy steaks can be lol. It was moreso a choice made for the sake of the experience.\n\nI was very, very happy to have chosen what I got.  I have had dry, chewy and some inedible lamb before. This was amazing! The meat was so soft. And the lamb lollipops were seasoned to perfection. \n\nJeff's fish and chips were by far the best we've ever had. All of the ingredients, even down to the ketchup had flavor bursts and when it was eaten altogether..*tears* it was magic. Lol.\n\nWe had drinks (I will update this review when I remember what* they were called) . Mine had berries in it and it was delish. Jeff's drink kinda burned my nose, but he enjoyed it a lot.\n\nThe servers were so awesome. They asked where we were from and when we told them Hawaii, they got excited. \n\nFor dessert, I don't remember what it was called lol but I do remember the man being excited to present it to us because it had Black Volcanic salt from - mmhm - Hawaii. The guy even winked at us lol. The dessert was not too sweet and it had that salty crunch to it because of the salt. \n\nI wish I had bukubillion bucks so I could try more food items!\n\nNext time we are in Vegas we will be sure to stop by again!"

But I docked 1 star off for service.\n\nI booked a reservation a month in advance for our much anticipated trip to Vegas and the food and quality is great! (Just not the service - will explain later) When you walk in, the hostess guide will tell you that you're entering the tube that transports you from Paris to London. As you walk towards the tables, you'll be shown the ceiling decorations that are supposed to represent Gordon Ramsay's hand movements when he makes the Beef Wellington. To me, it just looks like modern art-light work.\n\nWhen we were seated, we met our server who seemed friendly at first. But when he showed us the wine menu, and asked if we wanted anything alcoholic to drink, we both declined. And it was from then on that he had a somewhat sour mood with us. Was it because we didn't look like people who like to spend a little bit of money on drinks? I don't know what it was; but he did have a stuck-up attitude. There's nothing wrong with denying alcohol, but you shouldn't treat your customers differently because of that.\n\nAnyways, enough about him - let's move on to the food. If there was one thing we wished we knew beforehand was to plan accordingly our reservation time because it takes about 45 minutes to prepare Beef Wellington and they do not take preorders. Our reservation time was for 7:30pm and we had to catch a David Copperfield show at 9:30pm, and there was not enough time to allot in for the Beef Wellington, so we opted for other steak alternatives. I was slightly disappointed, but you live and learn. Next time though, we would set an earlier dinner time!\n\nSo we ordered:\n\n1. American Kobe filet - So delicious! The filet was moist and tender. I ordered the foie gras as accompaniment to the steak, and it was so flavorful! It was pretty pricey for only an 8 oz steak, but I had no regrets (5/5)\n\n2. Bone-In Ribeye - YUMMY. Did not fall short of our expectations at Gordon Ramsey's steakhouse. Marbled to perfection. Flavors are spot on. My bf also ordered the foie gras as accompaniment to the steak. Everything was so good. (5/5)\n\n3. Truffle Mac n Cheese - The *BEST* Truffle Mac n Cheese we've ever tasted! After taking the first bite, I had a flashback of all the Truffle Mac n Cheeses I've had in the past and nothing could compare to this one! If you love truffle, then you must get this one! The patrons beside us told us that they could smell the truffle oil from their table, haha. Not only that, but my bf isn't a fan of blue cheese - but you could barely taste it, so that's good! (5/5)\n\n4. Sticky Toffee Pudding -The presentation for the dessert was very chic and creative. It comes with brown butter ice cream, which is a great addition to the toffee pudding. Overall, the dessert was decadent, perfectly sweet, and overall just scrumptious! This is what Gordon Ramsey is also famous for, so we were pleased with the overall taste and quality. Yummy! (5/5)\n\n5. The free bread appetizer here is AMAZING. There's a medley of breads that you can choose from. My favorites are the ones filled with mushroom and pancetta. SO DELICIOUS!\n\nThe food here is downright delicious! The bill can end up to be quite expensive, but it's nice to splurge every once in awhile, especially for a high quality steakhouse like Gordon Ramsey's! I would definitely come here again, and hopefully not have that server again."

So, the run down... We were on a two week road trip and one of my stop choices was Las Vegas because I wanted to eat at Gordon Ramsay's Steak. I've always been so jealous watching Hells Kitchen seeing everyone get to try his food, so I had to put a stop to it! We didn't make reservations, well, we tried but apparently calling a day in advance didn't give enough lead time to not be booked, haha, I should've known. We did find out that there is a lounge area that is first come first serve, so we showed up there and prayed we'd get a seat and we did! We didn't have to wait very long either. Our waitress was awesome, attentive, and didn't mind joking back and forth with me about G.R. and agreeing to slipping him my number next time he's in town. I ordered 3 cocktails, all were good, but the best was the HK Antioxidant, it was really good. Ordered the Foie Gras and it was probably the best part of the entire meal. I ordered the Beef Wellington of course, I have been wanting to try it for forever and in part might be why I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be, that in itself isn't that big of a deal, but the pastry wasn't cooked thoroughly, so it was kind of mushy and gross, I was looking forward to the flaky pastry along side the tender meat, but it kind of made me feel sick, still I feel like had it been cooked properly it would have been awesome and I'm not one to complain. My brother and his girlfriend chose the chicken and it wasn't until after the fact that they told me the chicken was really dry. They didn't want to ruin my night, but that upset me because we all know how Gordon feels about dry chicken! I would have said something, but I didn't know. They also got the asparagus soup and we enjoyed the presentation and they really enjoyed the flavor. Then we ordered dessert, this was back in September of last year (2012) so I'm not positive of the names, but it was the sticky toffee one, this was a risk because I'm not a fan of toffee- so let me just say, it was THAT good... Amazing! Our bill with tip came to around $250, which I think was worth it for the experience and would go back again if given the chance, I feel like it was probably just an off night. However I did not slip the waitress my number to give to Ramsay as I'm looking for a stellar chef... Maybe I should try going after Graham next :P."

Kudos to our server, Adrian and his assistant, Conrad!  They were very informative about everything on the menu.  I like how their drink menu is an actual iPad that they bring over to your  table!  So techy!\n\nMy hubby ordered the Beef Wellington while I ordered the 24 ounce bone-in Ribeye steak.  My ribeye steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly that it didn't need any sauce (although I did order a side of Bernaise sauce).  Even the charring on my ribeye steak was perfect!  This was also our first time trying the Beef Wellington and we didn't care for it too much.  It comes cooked medium rare.  I guess it's an acquired taste, so we just shared the ribeye steak.  \n\nWe ordered the loaded baked potato and truffle Mac and cheese for our sides.  The Mac and cheese is to die for!  The baked potato, on the other hand, was huge but a bit on the dry side.\n\nAwesome dining experience overall!  Will definitely be back when we're in town again!"

There are a lot of great places to eat in Vegas that aren't nearly as expensive.  \n\nThanks to the yelpers that told me about the rewards/player's card discount.

            "review": "This was our most anticipated restaurant opening in Las Vegas. Chef Ramsay has been stocking Stations Casinos with winners of Hell's Kitchen, but he hadn't opened one of his own here yet. We've loved his shows (if you're only seeing him on Hell's Kitchen or Kitchen Nightmares, you're missing his best on BBC America.) We own most of his cookbooks and have tried a lot of his meals on our own, but we really wanted to sample some of his creations under the direction of Executive Chef Deric Meininger. We weren't disappointed.\n\nThis is where we decided to go for our wedding anniversary. I made reservations a month in advance to make sure we didn't run into any snags. I had flowers waiting for Brenda on the table and her daughter had stopped in one evening to have a bottle of wine waiting as well. Although we had reservations, we still waited a few minutes to be seated. We weren't upset considering how many people were just walking up to the podium and getting turned away because they didn't have reservations.\n\nOnce our table was ready, we were walked through the large bar area into the high ceilinged dining room. The first thing we noticed when sitting down (besides the large Union Jack on the ceiling) was that it seemed the music was playing much louder than it needed to be which distracted a bit from the romantic evening. However, by the time the food was served, we hardly noticed it any more.\nBecause this was a special occasion for us, we decided we were really going to splurge on our meals. I really wanted to try the Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu ($145/person), but there were so many other good things on the menu to try as well I decided to wait until next time for that. While we were ordering they brought out a selection of breads with Devonshire butter topped with black sea salt. The rolls with the pancetta in the center were fantastic. Brenda really wanted to try some of the sauces that were listed with the shellfish platter (tiger prawns, king crab, clams and lobster) so we started with that. When it arrived on a huge platter, we knew we weren't going to be leaving hungry. There was at least two of each type of shellfish and the sauces (especially the champagne mignonette) really brought out the flavors, much better than the regular cocktail sauce you get everywhere else. Our second course was the seared Foie Gras. It came with a delicious puree and was quickly polished off by the two of us.\n\nWe both knew we wanted steak with our dinner. Your waiter asks ahead of time whether or not you're having steak and if so, they wheel out this large mirrored display with the various cuts of beef that they serve and explain each one to you. I went with the 32 ounce Royal Long-bone Chop and Brenda ordered the American Kobe Filet. For sides, we had the heirloom carrots, saut\u00e9ed spinach, caramelized Brussels sprouts and the fingerling potatoes. (I said we were splurging.) \nWhile we waited for our food, we ordered another bottle of wine and watched the wait staff in action. They were exactly what you'd expect from a high end restaurant--attentive and polite but never intrusive. When the food arrived, we knew our stomachs were in for some trouble. the filet was probably the perfect size at 8 ounces, but I think I could have beaten someone to death with the long-bone chop because it was so large. Not only was my steak huge, but the side dishes were as well. No spoonful of vegetable/potatoes/whatever here--these are large bowls (at least a full cup or more) of each one. They are definitely meant for sharing. Both steaks were fantastic. Even though the chop was over an inch thick, it was still tender and cooked to the perfect medium rare. the filet was so tender you could cut it with a fork. If there was any disappointment (very little) it would have been the side dishes. The Brussels sprouts were good, but not as good as the ones we cook at home using Chef Ramsay's Christmas Special recipe. I liked the fingerling potatoes, but prefer the ones at GR Pub & Grill a bit more. The spinach was outstanding and it was the only thing that didn't get taken home in a doggie bag. To cap off the dinner we both had cappuccinos and I ordered some Sticky Toffee Pudding after hearing all the raves about it. I don't have a very big sweet tooth and this was just on the border (for me) of being too sweet but it was worth it. The brown butter ice cream that came with it, although sounding strange, was very good and went perfectly with the pudding cake. Luckily the GR Pub & Grill has the toffee pudding on their menu as well so we can find it somewhere without spending so much money.\n\nOverall we had an outstanding meal, service, and experience. The cost was a bit on the high side ($500 for two of us, including two bottles of wine and the tip), but well worth every penny. It's not a place you're going to go to every month, but if you have that special occasion and don't mind spending the money it should be one of your \"must visit\" food destinations."

I have an allergy to pepper and often am forced to stick to salads for dinner as they are easy to control. NOT THE CASE HERE! I was able to order anything I wanted as it was all prepared fresh. I had the most delicious mixed grill of shrimp, steak and pork cheek with veggies and a fabulous bread basket.  All ten of us were overwhelmed with the quality of the food and the experience the front of house staff provided.  We were well attended, shared delicious wine, and fully accomodated.

Well that is exactly what happened to me on my incredible visit to Gordon Ramsey Steak.\n\nI am a self proclaimed foodie.  I come from a HUGE family of Italian and Hawaiian cooks.  Most of the time prefer their cooking over most restaurants.  I love different flavors, textures and aromas and most importantly the love and care (most important ingredient) that gets put into preparing a dish.  I can honestly say, GRS did not disappoint. \n\nMy husband and I are huge Gordon Ramsey fans, Hells Kitchen owns us on Friday nights. So when my husband surprised me with an unexpected trip to Vegas, I immediately knew I wanted to eat at one of GR restaurants.  Watching Hells Kitchen creates in my mind an expectation that the food will be incredible and my dining experience will be unforgettable. It ended up being the highlight of my trip.  \n\nOur experience started with the chipper and friendly gal in the front who greeted us and tried to get us in before our reservation time.  While trying to do that, instead of making us wait outside, she graciously seated us in the bar area.  Our waitress immediately acknowledged us and helped us with the very savvy electronic drink menu.\n\nHalfway through or drinks and earlier than our reservation time :) , our waitress accompanied us to the main restaurant and seated us.  The ambiance has a cool, contemporary feel.  Everyone was dressed up, it felt so elegant and classy.  There were a variety of groups.  Some large tables who seemed like they were enjoying themselves as well as a few small intimate tables.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, Sergio introduced himself to us and layed our napkins on our laps,  ( I love that! ) poured our waters and informed us that Freddy would be our waiter for the evening then he was off to get our bread. Our waiter Freddy was incredibly knowledgeable and equipped with wonderful recommendations. \n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the Caesar Salad and as my entree the Rib Eye and The Alaskan King Crab.  My Caesar was very fresh.  The lettuce very cold and crisp.  The huge flakes of Parmesan cheese were rich and savory but thats not even the best part.... There are these boiled quail eggs that are coated with a breading and breakfast sausage mixture.... aaaaaa... I dont specifically know what the coating is but I need that in my daily life! haha My Rib Eye, hands down the best steak I have ever eaten... EVER!   I could cut through it like butter, medium was the perfect way for me to eat it and Freddy recommended a House Steak sauce that was so mouth watering.  Crushed garlic, herbs with a little tang was a perfect marriage to enhance my steak.  Ok so for my crab... I am an island girl.  I know my seafood, we were raised with exceptional seafood and I can without a doubt in my mind say this is THE most divine crab I have ever tasted... Just a squeeze of lemon is all it needed. It rolled perfectly out of its shell, It was fresh and when I put it into my mouth, I immediately knew I was NOT sharing this with my husband! lol The texture was perfect.  The meat was sweet, delicate, very juicy and it literally melted in my mouth.\n\nAlso to give you a full picture of my experience, while all of this savoring of flavors is going on Freddy is checking in at a very comfortable rate.  Not to much to where you are like oh my God leave me alone but never to where we thought he forgot about us. And the whole time with a wonderful smile.  Sergio who was partnered with Freddy to ensure an exceptional dining experience did more than his job.  I told my husband that Sergio made me feel like a rich person lol.  My fork dropped and he was there with a new one before I had to ask.  My husband went to the restroom and he cleared his area, re-folded his napkin and dusted the bread crumbs off the table and re-set his silverware.  He was extremely attentive, incredibly kind and very accommodating. \n\nI stopped eating after a little bit.  It took total restraint but I needed to save room for dessert.  Both Sergio and Freddy were spot on with their recommendation of the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The sweet pudding cake and its brown sugar goodness warmed me to my SOUL!  It was like one of those comfort foods that your grandma makes that makes the world right again.  The butter ice cream I can assure you is unlike anything you have ever tasted.  I dont even have a word worthy to describe it.  But for the sake of the review, it was beautiful and harmonious to my taste buds. It left my tongue coated with a sweet brown sugar taste.\n\nKudos to General Manager Micheal Honea who keeps up Chef Gordon Ramseys standard in this restaurant.  I am sure that Chef Ramsey is so pleased that he has Mr. Honea ensuring quality and consistency while he cannot be there. I had him called over to our table because I could not have left without sharing my experience with him.  BRAVO!"

I guess it's a creative piece of art, but seems somewhat too abstract to awe at. When the hostess pointed it out before we sat down, I think she expected us to look up and be amazed at his delicate/intentional hand movements to procure his famous Beef Wellington.\n\nAnyway, we went with the Foie Gras for an appetizer, the American Cap, and the Beef Wellington. Foie Gras will always be good--was happy to have it since it was banned in the state of California a couple years ago. The American Cap was juicy, fatty, and tasty (highly recommended). The Beef Wellington was good but nothing life-changing, I mean with those hand movements outlined on the ceiling light fixture, I should've better appreciate the countless hours Mr. Ramsay spent to perfect his art (sarcasm).\n\nI otherwise had a really good experience here and had fun laughing at Gordon Ramsay's hand movement light fixture.

To our surprise, one of the Gordon Ramsay Steak managers contacted us soon thereafter to invite us back for another dining experience, promising to make things right.  Challenge accepted! \n\nFor appetizer, we got complementary scotch eggs that were lightly battered and deep fried; when we cut inside, the egg yolk was still running! yum! \n\nWe also ordered oysters and clams, yeah yeah yeah, i know it's a steak house but we felt like having some shellfish for the night. They had a wide variety from the East to the West coast and were so fresh and full of favor! \n\nThe Wagyu beef slider was out of this world!  It was so juicy and perfectly cooked.  I can see myself coming back here and ordering 5 of them at the same time! Pork belly was oh so crispy on the skin side with perfect layering of fat on the inside it literally melted in our mouths with the first bite! \n \nThe Rib cap and the bone-in ribeye were some of the best steaks we have ever had! For sides, we had bone marrow & shitaki mushrooms, however, the bone marrow was a bit too gamy for our taste and i wouldn't recommend it. I had tried bone marrow before at Animal restaurant in LA and it wasn't gamy at all. The shitaki mushroom was on point though.\n\nOur server, Matthew, also one of their managers, oversaw our entire dinner, and his professionalism was beyond reproach. This time Gordon Ramsay Steak redeemed itself and was deserving of the namesake.  We have many family members and friends visiting from out-of-town year round. As hosts, we wanna be able to impress them with the best dining experience Las Vegas has to offer, and I think I can finally count on GRS to provide a boat load of it."

It kept freezing and I don't think it is necessary with the wine selection that they have. I did like the feel of the restaurant and staff all looked and acted professional....

The food was excellent.  I downed a 24oz hunk of meat that if I was alone and in a dark closet I would have gnawed on the bone for a few minutes before throwing it into a corner.  Our waiter suggested getting marrow to eat as a companion to our steak.  It was delicately put to me that it's like meat butter.  Terribly delicious on top of your steak.   The haricot verts I ordered on the side were tempura style but the batter had a hint of citrus.  Shhhh....don't tell my mom but it might have been better than hers.\n\nI didn't order any of the drinks but my boyfriend had what looked like a mojito with champagne added.  Tasty!\n\nIf you get a chance, the coffee was good but not as good as I hoped.  It might be my time in LA and the Bay Area but I like my coffee unbearably strong now and this was a little weak even though it was a french press.  You might have to ask for it a little darker if you go.  What made up for it was the 3 liqueur infused chocolate spoons.  It was just the right size for a sweet treat without having to order dessert.  It was a waddle of shame back to my room but one will not forget!\n\nOn a side note, I loved their efficiency.  I know Gordon Ramsey is known for that but I didn't REALLY understand until coming here.  I work in the food industry and would love to have my place run as smoothly as his."

Finally sitting down to eat at one of Ramsey's restaurant (after saving money for the journey and the food... Not easy for a humble teacher from Texas), I was a tad disappointed in Ramsey Steak. The decor of the restaurant is great... Very cool \"Chunnel\" from Paris casino into his British restaurant. However... The tables were SO CLOSE TOGETHER and the noise level was SO LOUD I couldn't hear the waiter! \n\nThe food... The shrimp and lobster (we had shrimp cocktail and lobster Wellington) were spot on... Worth the price... Whomever was in charge of seafood needs a raise! Sooooo yummy! We also tried the beef Wellington which was a huge  disappointment. I actually spit out steak into my napkin... Gristly and chewy. :-( I've never had GOOD gnocchi before so I also had to try that... It melted in your mouth... Perfection. :-) So... If you go... Stick with seafood! Don't waste $80 on beef Wellington unless you like gristly  -chewy filet. And, perhaps bring a megaphone so you can communicate with your waiter. :-)\n\nI am still a big fan... Just wish I had been able to taste a Wellington prepared by Ramsey. He would've never allowed that steak to be served... Even to a poor girl from Texas, sitting behind the service station - at the back of the restaurant - packed in with other guests - dressed in a way that didn't communicate wealth or importance. :-)"

In short, it was good, but not amazing, and I'll give more detail below.\n\nWe had a 7 pm reservation, and checked in at 6:55.  We were told it would be a few more minutes but to \"please take a seat at the bar and we'll come find you when you're table is ready.\"  So, we head in through the tube-like entrance into a PACKED bar, with no where to sit, and not even anywhere to stand.  We poked around and debated ordering a drink, but decided not to because we thought we'd be seated soon.  So back into the smoky, loud casino we went to wait.  And wait.  Aaaaaand wait.  Not a bench or a chair in sight, we stood and waited for nearly 30 minutes for our table.  Pretty disappointing given we had a reservation.\n\nWe were seated and greeted by our server, who presented us with an iPad to look at drinks.  Kinda gimicky, but ok.  We ordered drinks and then he disappeared for a long time, returning with the \"meat trolley.\"  Unfortunately we already had looked at the menu while he was gone, and knew what we wanted, but then we had to sit through a 10 minute meat presentation before even ordering a starter.  Now it's almost 8, and we haven't had a bite to eat.  \n\nWe ordered the pork belly and sliders to start, which came promptly after a nice bread selection.  The pork belly was very good, but lacked salt, and the sliders were better.  We ordered a signature Wellington to share, and were talked into ordering a side with it, which ended up being WAY too much food.  The Wellington was a bucket list item for me, and I was so excited for it, but it was just ok.  The steak was amazingly tender, but needed more seasoning and the pastry and duxel were borderline flavorless.  For $55 for an 8 oz portion, it was underwhelming at best.  We didn't touch the potato side because with 2 starters, bread, and a Wellington, we were stuffed!  The portions here are pretty hefty, so don't be coerced into ordering more than you need.\n\nMy hubby ordered a second beer from our waiter's \"helper\" and when it came he was surprised at how hoppy it was.  He drank it, but when we got the bill it had a completely different beer with \"Hoppy\" in the name instead of what my hubby ordered.  Pretty weak for a fancy place.\n\nThe best part of the visit was probably the ambiance, I loved the dining room with the Union Jack ceiling! They managed to make an upscale steakhouse into a \"fun\" environment which was refreshing for sure.  It felt a great balance of casual and fancy.\n\nIn all, we're glad we came, but I wish it was better.  The service could use some work, and the food could use some seasoning.  It would be nice to bring bread and/or let guests order starters before presenting the \"meat trolley.\" Our bill was $155 for a cocktail, 2 beers, 2 starters, a shared steak and a side dish.  Pretty comparable to most Vegas restaurants, but we still feel like the experience was just \"ok.\""

Overall, the food was absolutely delicious and service was excellent, but the price and few other minor errors dropped 1 star.\n\nArrival/Seating: This place is crowded all of the time.  They were great when we had to switch our reservations, but upon arrival they were running roughly 30-40 minutes behind schedule.  We had a drink at the bar until we were seated, but 40 minutes is a long time.  When seated, the hostess congratulated us on our \"anniversary\" and asked how long we'd been married - a small error, but they asked upon booking if it was a special occasion and we told them our engagement so.....if you're going to ask, get it right :)\n\nAmbiance:  The atmosphere is very trendy, with a mix of an upscale restaurant.  The lighting is numerous shades of red and white, with very upbeat (not necessarily techno or house) music playing constantly.  On the whole, it's a bit dim and loud, but not overly so.  People were dressed more trendy than \"nice,\" and you're fine with pants and a collard shirt.  No jacket required.  \n\nService:  The service from the wait staff was great.  They were extremely informative, quick and helpful.  They seem to be very well staffed on all ends.  You never go too long without a water refill or an inquisition about another drink, etc.  They definitely try to sell you on their \"Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu,\" but were not pushy at all.\n\nFood:  Delicious.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer, Caesar salads, the American Wagyu \"Eye\", Beef Wellington, macaroni and cheese and Sriracha-fried broccoli.\n\nPrice: Not surprisingly, it's extremely expensive.  The meal for the 2 of us, with 3 drinks apiece, was roughly $360 including tip.\n\n----\n\nAll in all it was a great experience, but I suspect we'll try a few other places before coming back to Steak, given the price."

We booked the table as soon as we decided that we were gonna pass by Vegas, around 3-4 months prior to the actual visit. We didn't think that it was such a big deal, since we booked that long in advance. Apparently, the receptionist in our hotel in Vegas disagreed. Once we said this was gonna be one of the highlights in our trip, she commented:\"how'd you guys manage to get a table there?! You booked it 3 years in advance or something?\" Boy, did our eyes popped out and our jaws dropped when she mentioned it. Well, luck was in our favour, I guess. \n\nSince we checked out on the internet how we were supposed to dress (business casual), my boyfriend and I slipped into something fancier than our jeans and tshirt. He slipped into a shirt and dark trousers while I into a pair of heels and a dress. When we got there though, we were left a bit disappointed and felt a bit silly with our outfits. We saw people with khaki shorts and checkered board yellow shirt, tshirt, and all those outfits that we never would've thought to be categorised into \"business casual\". I thought if you want to have a dress code for the restaurant, it would be best to keep it that way.\n\nThe rest of the visit though, was beyond our expectations. We got a table upstairs where people were dressed fancier (plus and minus for us, since we totally missed Christina from Hell's Kitchen) and the waiter was very knowledgeable. He pulled out a meat trolley (yes, I mean it!) and showed us the different cuts and all the goodness that came with the cuts. In the end though, we were tempted by the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu. We got five dishes and all were accompanied by wine that matches it. To say that the food was great was to say the least. The scotch egg was perfectly cooked, the tomato heirloom salad got this vinaigrette that could turn a meat lover into an herbivore.  The risotto was creamy and scallop was seared finely. The wellington, it just melt in your mouth like it was nobody's business. The sticky toffee pudding was just heavenly. It was sticky, sweet, and you just want to lick your plate and ask for second.\n\nIn the end of the night, we left the restaurant very pleased, full and a bit tipsy. I don't know if it was the alcohol they kept serving us with each dish that made the food tasted superb, but what I know was that if I was to visit Vegas again, I would definitely make sure to make a reservation here again. Every penny was worth it."

A very special occasion.  \n\nThe food is extremely expensive and my expectations are significantly high for first class service and food that combines tastes and textures I don't often see paired. In a steak house of this caliber, I want meat that I could not possibly prepare at home nor find at the local restaurant.  \n\nService: Our waiter was attentive but difficult to understand between his accent and the loud ambient noise--we were seated in a semi private room with 4 tables. Water glasses were not filled as often as needed, used dishes were left on the table, and some complained that the service was dragged out too long especially between bread basket and main meal. \n\nFood: the consensus with all six of us was thumbs down. I had the bone in NY strip. A good size hunk of meat. My first two bites were all grizzle and I had to discretely spit it out into my napkin. Once through that, I still encountered  gristle and had a small pile of meat discards on my plate. I didn't care for the taste of the meat. It has a sourish aftertaste. That I'm not holding against the restaurant, it may be my preference. Other dishes ordered: beef short rib (had better), royal long bone chop (impressive looking but expected more), filet (alright but nothing special), bone in rib eye (better the night before at different restaurant), sea bass (dry).  I tasted the foie butter (not special). A few of us ordered the loaded baked potato. A very very large potato and good tasting. Filling and possibly a little too much. If the meat had been better, I might have appreciated this much more. Can't remember what other sides were ordered.\n\non the plus side for food: delicious and varied bread basket that set the tone for more good things to come, uniquely flavored green salad that had the taste buds salivating. \n\nWe ended with the infamous toffee pudding cake. Very sweet, not my favorite but others thought delicious. I couldn't get over the butter shaped ice cream.  I also don't like chocolate volcano cake which this reminds me of. \n\nOverall, I would not return or recommend to others. Vegas has a lot of really good restaurants, this is not one of them. Don't waste one of your few meals here."

I'm not sure if it's because we filled ourselves up on the apps, but the beef had little flavour and tasted at best mediocre.  I enjoyed the pastry of the wellington a lot but together.. I don't know, I actually didn't even finish my entree.  I also tried their ribeye steak, which was done much better than my wellington and reminded me that I'm actually at a Gordon Ramsay resto.\n\nAll in all, this was disappointing.

When we were seated, a few days later, we asked the waiter about children's options. He said there were no options for children but the petit filet was a good choice (at $50+.) You might say we should not have brought our 10 year old to this level of restaurant but that is why we called before making a reservation.\n\nIn the end, the steaks were just okay and the service was just okay.

Strong attempt. \n\nHad a decent cocktail. \n\nCan we talk about the f*cking Beef Wellington though? The way Ramsay talks about it on every show it should be food of the gods. But everything was sub-par: the puffed pastry wasn't (and had no texture). The duxelles was overly salted and under-mushroomed. The demi glace just tasted like salt goo. Potatoes and carrots were totally unmemorable. The cook on the filet was fine but it lacked flavor and was literally too large for the \"pastry.\" Honestly it felt like a dish scaled up to a large banquet: mass produced, going through the motions, forgettable. \n\nI like Ramsay as a TV personality - he seems to know what he's doing and gives a shit about the people he's helping. But this isn't the first time I've been disappointed by one of his Vegas restaurants. I would think that perhaps being on a half dozen shows while also trying to run a restaurant empire may be stretching oneself too thinly. \n\nI should mention that the d\u00e9cor of this place looks cheap. Not that it has anything to do with the food but the prices don't match the experience. \n\nThis was not worth the money or time, and I'm frustrated that I \"fell\" for it. Would not go back. \n\nYou want consistently great steak in Vegas? Go to Craftsteak. Collichio seems to keep a tight reign on his restaurants.  Have gone for years and have never been disappointed."

Ricardo definitely was very knowledgable of the menu and even walked us to the restroom from the 2nd floor to show us where it was located.  Here's the issue...\n\nThe Food:\nAmerican Wagyu Rib Cap- nice sear and crust on the outside, tender on the inside, had nice beefy flavor.  The only issue is that it was way too SALTY.\n\nBeef Wellington- Since Gordon Ramsay is known for this we were excited to try the dish, but it just didn't do anything for us.  It was at room temp, the outside was soggy and again, way too SALTY.  \n\nSteak Accompaniments- Bone Marrow wasn't bad, but nothing special.\n\nSides- cream spinach and mushrooms.  Way too salty.\n\nThe food is the star in this review and unfortunately tonight, it just wasn't up to par. \n\nGordon Ramsay would have said, \"You f*cking donkey!\"\n\nI'll give it a 3 for now and give it another shot, especially since we didn't get the sticky toffee pudding.

We got a booth upstairs which was nice because it blocked out noise and it was very cozy and comfy...\n\nAnd then our waitress came to show us the different types of meats they offer and share a bit about tenderness, location of cut, etc. Very interesting! \n\nWe ordered our own Beef Wellington which now as I think back was a mistake - we should've shared because we were SO STUFFED!!  With the delicious breads - they didn't have a lot of variety but the three they offered was AWESOME - the olive bread was our favorite but they also had a focaccio, and some cheesy roll... served with sweet cream salted butter... so hard not to dive into the bread while waiting for the beef wellingtons....\n\nFor sides we ordered the Brussels Sprouts that was cooked perfectly with fried shallots and prosciutto, along with their fingerling potatoes with truffle and Parmesan! EXCELLENT and PERFECT sides!\n\nAnd the Beef Wellington?  Well it was SO delicious!! With the pastry, the tender filet - with the flavors bursting out... sigh.  I've seen on Top Chef Junior - the KIDS made this - flavored with mustard and mushrooms... the technique of searing the meat and then baking with the phyllo... and i'm sure my memory is still missed some steps but it's not easy - and it tasted so tender and flavorful!! Loved it!!\n\nAnd of course - we HAD to order their sticky toffee pudding cake with butter ice cream!!  We ended up eating half and all the butter ice cream and bringing back the other half of the sticky toffee pudding cake and ate it a few days later - and it was JUST as perfect! DROOL!!!  \n\nGreat service, excellent cozy environment - and a wonderful food dining experience to at least try once in a lifetime!!"

The beet salad and mushroom risotto were very good but tiny. The main course was beef wellington which surprised me since it wasn't one if the better cuts of steak and is baked in a layer of pastry dough! I guess I just didn't realize what that was. For the cost and the name of the restaurant being \"Steak\", I figured a better non-breaded cut of meat would have been the flagship recommendation.\n\nThe desert was also way to big a rich to even get through half of.

It's weird to walk through a red tunnel from France and be in London. \n\nDress code on their site says smart casual,  but it is NOT enforced. Majority of the people sitting next table over or on the bottom floor were all wearing cargo shorts, t-shirts, caps and flip flops. They should just change dress code on the website to casual, so everyone can just be comfortable. \n\nThe hostess who walked us to the table isn't very friendly, no chatting or smiling. When we sat down she did not even say enjoy the meal or your server will be with you shortly, nothing! \n\nThe beef wellington was the most disappointing part of the menu. Made me glad I ordered the tasting menu over the entree itself. The puff pastry itself was not crispy, it was soggy and the beef had a very weak flavor. Very little au jus given and most was absorbed by the mashed potato. The menu says there is vegetables included, 2 small blocks of potatoes doesn't qualify to be written on the menu!\n\nThe assigned server was great, came by to check in and clean the table, replaced silverware after each dish. \n\nThe other servers who came by to drop the dishes need to work on their delivery technique. You shouldn't angle the plates when delivering to the table or the plating of the food shifts in place!! If I was to act like Gordon on the show, I should have thrown the dish on the floor!! See attached photos for reference.\n\nThe best dish on the tasting menu was the dessert! The icecream and bread pudding was on point, however the server should had only drizzled a bit of the sauce on the pudding rather than pouring most of it on and to leave some in the tin can for the taster (me) to add more as needed. It was very strong powerful taste, size could be smaller and more proportionate to the icecream that was shaped as a block of butter. \n\nFor $145 a person (not including drinks) from a celebrity chef who emphasizes on plating and taste in food I expected the meal to be at least satisfactory, rather than feeling ripped off. \n\nHope Gordon returns to this restaurant and start yelling at some people!!"

We went to your restaurant on December 25th to celebrate Christmas as a couple and enjoy a wonderful experience of food and dining.\n\nThe saving grace for 2 stars is because the food was actually great, everything else was just \"sad\".\n\nWe were 10 mins ahead of our reservation.  Walked up to the hostess' area to get laser scanned treatment from head-to-toe from their \"Queen Bee\" hostess (the one that stood behind the podium and the only one who wore ballet flats) I don't think even TSA did that to me.  Husband told her our reservation time, and we got evil eyes flying draggers throwing at our direction from all 5 of them. We had interrupted their gossiping session.  The response was that we could go in and get a drink or wait outside as our table wasn't ready.  Then, the 5 of them went back to their gossiping session. P.S. We were dressed according to their dress casual - jacket, heels, cocktail dress etc.\n\nSo eventually we decided to go in and get a drink and wait.  One of their hostess's job is to open the door, nothing more or less.  She won't tell you the direction or hook you up with a chair or give you the drink menu or anything.  She apparently is there to only open and hold the door. A door stop can take care of it if that is the personal touch Mr Ramsay was looking to achieve.  \n\nWe adventured our way in the bar area, standing awkwardly.  Husband pushing his way through the wave of diners to the bar, obtained the drink menu from the bartender.  Mission achieved! We finally sat down and moved to a corner table, a cocktail waitress came up with the iPad with all the drinks in it.  Ah, I was in a better mood at the point.  The cocktail waitress came up and asked what we wanted to drink, and we were about to put in the order.  Our \"lovely\" hostess popped right to our face and told us our table is ready.  An evil eye sight exchange happened between the cocktail waitress and the hostess.  Not sure this is the theme of this restaurant - plenty of cat fight atmosphere or they took pleasure creating  an uncomfortable setting for the patrons.\n\nMove forward, we arrived at our table.  Further sad atmosphere.  There were about 5 tables that are located at the back corner of 1st floor.  All I can see is the entrance of the staff area, not the kitchen cooking area.  It is literally the entrance of the staff before they get on the dinning area.  You can elbow your next table.  I in fact we ended up starting a little chitchat with next table diners.  It is pretty normal in New York City restaurants, but not in Peter Lugers, Charlie's in Florida, or even Morimoto, or his arch-rival's Mesa Grill.  \"Steak\" was frankly not in the same level steak house that Gordon Ramsey would even be willing to compare himself.  Some simple screens or other aesthetics would easily correct this, but it certainly needs something.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of red, Onion Soup, Beet Root Salad, Rib Cap, Beef Wellington, Grilled Asparagus, Chocolate two-way, Toffee Pudding.  I like the vegetables and side dishes more than I do with Beef Wellington.  Little that I know I forgot to order the sauce, and of course our waiter didn't bring that up or even provide advice on how we should do it.  In fact, my husband goes to fine restaurants and relinquishes control to the chef.  His feeling is that if he is going to be eating top-level cuisine, he should trust the chef's tastes.  The waiter stated that everything must be put in the same time, and if you forgot something and do not know your way around ordering...yup...pretty much SOL.\n\nI adored the kitchen staff and their work, but front of the house probably the worst I even seen in the same category.\n\nIn all fairness, I like Gordon Ramsay's Rib Cap more than Bobby Flay's Rabbit dish, but I don't think I would come back to this exact location again.  Mr Ramsay, please do your magic and correct the situation there."

We ordered it medium rare but it was dry and bland, especially when compared  to the ribcap, the filet, and the beef wellington. They also left the string the ribeye that was used to hold the bacon in place. Our waiter, Jessica, seemed rushed and never asked how our meal was going.

First let me say that unless you are wealthy or happen to well in the casino (thank you Wisconsin Badgers!), these are very pricey menu items.  However, it was worth every penny!\n\nWe were first served a Scotch Egg for an Amuse Bouche.  I have no idea how they created this, but I made sounds that are probably illegal to make in public (even in Vegas).  Then they brought out an Heirloom Salad.  This was a great salad all by itself, but when you paired it with the Riesling, it made you want to write bad checks.  Next we were served a Scallop Risotto and his signature Beef Wellington.  Both were what you would expect from a Chef Ramsay restaurant.  Then out came the Cu De Gra, a Sticky Toffee Pudding paired with a Tawny Port.  Let me just say, I am normally not a fan of desserts.  I never order them and when I do eat them, they are forced on me.  This dish however... I have never eaten a sweet dish that was so good, that I wanted to proclaim my love for it.  After the manager made me get off the table, I finished the greatest dessert I have ever had.\n\nThe only thing that out-shined the food was the staff.  The Sommelier, and the two waiters served us in a Fine Dining fashion.  Each one knew everything about the food, how it was prepared, and how it tasted to them.  We were both extremely impressed with this wait staff and that is rare for me. \n\nLong story short (too late), you need to make sure Gordon Ramsay Steak is on your culinary bucket list.  Ironically, I still didn't try their steak.  Oh no... That means I have to go back..."

After the ban the last time I had foie gras was when Psycho Donuts in San Jose were giving free foie gras donuts. Yesterday on my last night at Vegas I came here for dinner. There were two items I had in mind: 1) Hudson Valley Foie Gras 2) Beef Wellington. I waited in anticipation for both items. The first dish was the foie gras. When I took a bite of this foie gras it reminded me when I last had foie gras at a California restaurant after the ban - it was at Boulevard in San Francisco. I took my time eating this foie gras. I cut the foie gras into thin slices. I placed the thin slices of foie gras with the bite sizes of pumpkin waffle. This provided a typical contrast of savory and sweet texture. I treated this foie gras dish as if it was the main dish. The main dish the Beef Wellington takes about 45 minutes to cook. I never had Beef Wellington before and it was worth the wait. The pastry had that golden crust. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. Some people think a steak that is medium rare is too red. I never understood some people's fascination of a well done steak. For the amount of money you pay for a great quality steak why destroy the quality of the meat. What I love about the Beef Wellington that it's only cooked one way - medium rare only. Chef Ramsay is making the statement that customers have to adjust to him and not the other way around. The customer is not always right. Overall having dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak with a chance to have foie gras was great way to have dinner on my last night in Vegas."

How can i even start to describe service, food. ambiance perfection? \nThe Gordon Ramsay Steak is everything i expected. \nI recommend the Beef Wellington, the lobster appetizer is amazing. \nReservations are a MUST! Or you can show up 15-30 minutes before 5pm and try to grab a seat at the bar or lounge. \nThe best part? Gordon Ramsay himself walked in during our visit and i had the pleasure of seeing the man at work, met him and talked to him. MOST humble, kindest, sweetest, funniest celebrity i have ever met.\nFIVE stars, Gordon is worth a million stars. Go here, you wont regret it."

Our server Donnie (whose name I forgot in my original review) was knowledgeable, helpful and unpretentious.  A server worthy of a 5 star restaurant.  We were never rushed but never ignored.  The clams on the 1/2 shell and shrimp cocktail with cocktail sauce foam were perfect.  \n\nThe steaks, however, were merely good.  My fianc\u00e9's filet mignon was undercooked and, when returned, was a bit tough and tasteless.  My bone in ribeye was very well seasoned but also tough. I have had better steaks at the Capitol Grill in Detroit.\n\nIn all, the restaurant is very good.  I was hoping for better."

I love the decor, music, uniforms, but most of all the menu and cocktail selections. Our server Donnie was amazing. He knew exactly what to recommend, was attentive, and did not rush our dining experience. I highly recommend asking for his section if possible. We started with Side Car martinis..the best I have ever had. For appetizers we shared a half dozen fresh and juicy oysters, caesar salad (the most unique dressing I've ever tasted), hamachi carpaccio with truffle, and lobster stuffed with chorizo. For my main course I had the Fishermans Grill which consists of mussels, prawns and assorted fish, each cooked to perfection with a little curry aioli for dipping. It was divine! My friend had the rib eye cap, which had the perfect charred crust and then when you sliced into it, a perfect medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I have ever tasted, and the portion was for a normal appetite. We tried the carrots with ranch seasoning and crisy chicken skin and the sauteed mushrooms as sides. Both were so yummy, but we were really full and didnt need them. For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding and it was better than the first time I tried it. After mentioning this the wonderful manager Amanda, the pastry chef came out to our table to make sure we were happy. We felt like VIPS. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Las Vegas."

The ambiance and decor is very open and things like a large union jack gives it a very distinct british feel. The ipad drink menu was an interesting touch. I had the ribeye cooked medium rare and it was nice and tender. but towards the inner part of the steak it was more rare which I didnt like(I ended up taking it home and throwing it into a stew for flavoring and it was awesome btw!). Service was good and rest of the food was decent, nothing to complain about. Very expensive food, even though it was good, not sure if it's worth the prices here. Still, a solid choice if one is looking to splurge but I would think theres more affordable(read as still expensive but not as expensive as here) options available."

We dined in October 2013, and I can see many menu items have already changed seasonally, which I like.\n\nSteak met every one of my expectations. We sat in a more private room on the second floor and though we were right next to the central walkway to the room, the staff was considerate and tried to give us space and privacy. I began with the Foie Gras, as it is illegal in California, and my heart melts over a properly cooked Foie Gras. Sure enough, it was moist and soft, and came with a pumpkin waffle. I've got to say the thought of a waffle cheapened up the dish, but the flavors and textures were spot on.\n\nBefore ordering, we were shown a cart of the different steak cuts they offer and explained the difference between each. Don't come here if you're an animal activist vegan (though the name Steak should have told you that).\n\nWith dinner, I had a glass of Justin cabernet and though it is the cheapest cab on the menu, it is a fantastic choice from Paso Robles. I couldn't resist a Beef Wellington, and I was happy to receive a perfectly cooked dish. Fine dining is often associated with small portions, but between the appetizer and main course, I was completely satisfied.\n\nThank you for a wonderful meal."

From the ambiance and decor to the attentiveness of the wait staff and the quality of the food and its preparation, this place is top notch.\nThe bread plate was superb. My favorite was the truffle rolls, but the pancetta rolls, the lemon thyme focaccia and the walnut Stilton baguette were all delicious, as well. \nI had been dreaming about a GR beef wellington for years and it was all that I could have imagined and more. The meat was succulent, the pastry light and flaky and each of the individual elements from the duxelles to the dijon stood on their own but also came together in perfect harmony with each bite. I can't wait to go back and order it again!\nTo finish off the decadence, I had to have to sticky toffee pudding. This is probably the only thing that could've made me wish I had eaten less of the wellington. As the waiter told me before I order it, it is the best dessert you'll ever have! Each spoonful was sweet, rich, warm and moist. It's enough to share with 2 or 3 others, but you'll enjoy every bit of it!\nFreddy and Giovanni were our waiter team and they could not have been more personable or professional.\nGreat staff, great ambiance and amazing food made for one fantastic dining experience!"

I'm a Masterchef junky as well as Facebook follower with Gordon and went with the sole purpose of trying his \ninfamous Beef Wellington. The night started on some what of a sour note as I quickly found out the hostess that took my reservation put it down for the wrong week...but luckily they corrected their mistake and were able to accommodate and got us a table.  Unfortunately, it was in the very back corner of the room by the wine refrigerator...can't help but feel that was on purpose. The hostesses that greeted us had a little \"attitude\" and were doing the \"rolling eyes\" thing with each other.  One could tell they already had a plan.   I had called ahead 1 week earlier to reserve a table. Called 3 days  later to confirm...but...the day of,  got an email with the wrong date as we were driving to the restaurant half hour before.   We're locals and Harrahs property Platinum members which was noted at the  time of reservation. So yes , we expected a little better table location and had requested the main seating area as well.    First let down.  Second, the Beef Wellington was well....a little tasteless.  Tender, flaky crust..but I think the mustard or some spice was left out. It had no flavor.  Bland.  However... I did give 4 stars because although the above comments we're negative, my husbands bone in ribeye was to die for! That goes as well for the delicious Mac and Cheese side dish.  The bread was wonderful and I couldn't get enough of the beet salad.   My husband  had the oysters and wanted more he said. Delicious.  The wait service was superb...presentation was lovely.   Very sad we did not order dessert.  We simply ate too much.  But we plan to return with family for drinks and to try his infamous Sticky Toffee Pudding which I have been told will make you melt.  Overall...front greeters need to grow up...smile more and not fake it... which they appeared to be doing.  Too young in my opinion and declassified his restaurant. Servers need to be recognized as outstanding  and the food was superb with the exception of the Beef Wellington.  Missed the mark just a little on that one. Gave 4 stars overall and do plan to return.\nGordon, hostesses can make or break your restaurant. They are the first employees your patrons have interaction with and set the tone for their dining experience.  These girls have no visible experience and need to go.  THEY DO NOT BELONG at a 5 star restaurant."

They also had a wide range of selection for drinks including Innis & Gunn on draught which was great. Lastly our dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter bar which was amazing.

In Vegas I've tried pieros and del friscos, and would only give them 3.5-4 stars tops . Gordon Ramsay Steak gets a solid 4.5-5 stars, partly due to the hip trendy setting that's totally Vegas (not really wanting to see another dark paneled wall steakhouse reminiscent of the 1960s) , partly due to the excellent service , but mostly due to the fantastic steaks offered here. I had the American Kobe rib eye wrapped in bacon and it was fantastic . Can't wait to try the rib cap . They said it was only 8 ounces but I couldn't finish it and I can devour a 24 ounce porterhouse . Maybe it was the lobster chorizo appetizer or variety of breads that filled me up, but whatever it was, I have some delicious leftovers , such as the creamed corn and loaded baked potato . Id skip the lobster appetizer just to have more room for the sticky toffee dessert, which Is Epic, with its brown butter ice cream.  You'll pay a pretty penny here (we averaged $120/person ) but I don't mind if its worth it, esp considering I spent $100/person at Del Friscos and it was not worth it .  Surprised to find such a good steakhouse in a hotel . Try it and hope you'll like it as much as I did"

It was extremely juicy and a little overwhelmingly heavy with the juicy pork combined with grits. Not the best pork belly that I've had, and there was no balance in the dish.\n\nSides - Upon recommendations from the waiter, we got the shiitake mushrooms, mac & cheese and fingerling potatoes. Because a meal here is guaranteed to be very heavy, I would caution ordering the heavier sides. Our group of 4 was barely able to finish any of the sides, especially the mac & cheese which was extremely heavy. The rest of the sides were decent and savoury.\n\nMain - I shared a Beef Wellington for 2 (this option is about $7 cheaper but there is less pastry as they divide the loaf in half for 2). The pastry was slightly soggy, but overall the steak was very tender and juicy. \n\nDessert - The sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream is to die for! One of the best desserts I've had, the pudding cake was sweet and flavourful with a soft texture. The lighter ice cream flavour was the perfect compliment.\n\nService - This definitely puts the restaurant above and beyond all others. We were showed a tour of all the steaks, and the waiters were extremely welcoming to questions and provided useful recommendations. One of our waiters even starting joking and conversing with us in French, which made the atmosphere lighter and more enjoyable. \n\nOverall this was a pricey splurge but I'd say it is definitely worth it for the experience! Just remember to not go overboard because all the dishes are designed to be on the heavier side."

The place was large and spacious with different levels.  Our server was very nice and could tell some of us were first timers.  We had a lot of the apps and I chose the beef Wellington for dinner.  They brought a fancy cart with different cuts of meat over to explain to us what we were actually ordering.  There was bread on the table with compound butter which was unreal.   All of the food was very rich so large portions weren't necessary.  The food was the best I've ever had and everyone should eat here!"

The complimentary bread is good but don't fill your stomach with useless carbs. I left almost half of my ribeye steak because I was so full from the app & breads. As for the value? Was it worth all my $$$$? Let me just say, I've had better.\n\nAmbiance: decor & set up were all impressive but this restaurant has to listen to the patrons when we say the music is too loud. This is a fine dining restaurant with top $ food. My experience should not be ruined by some funky loud a$$ music. It made me mad that they're blasting music. I would understand if this was Ramsey's burGR or the Pub restaurant. Goodness! Stop with the tasteless music already!!!\n\nService: forgot my waiter's name. He wasn't good. Service should actually heighten your restaurant experience but service actually didn't match the stellar food that they're supposed to be providing.\n\nOverall: you can do better! Go spend the money somewhere else! Unless you are willing to sit through the annoyance of hearing the loud music."

Be ready to spend some money (especially if you get a featured app and wine) but the beef wellington for 2 for $100 was well worth it.  It actually brought tears to my eyes it was so unbelievably good!  We had the small seafood tower for an app, split the wellington and truffle mac & cheese and toffee pudding for dessert.

The steak was definitely one of the best that I've ever had. The beef quality was great. They also use some special sauce with mustard seeds on the steak that just makes it taste even better. The soup was real good but the flavor was a bit strong. Fingerling potatoes were ok I would say their taste were pretty much neutral with the steak. The place is a bit on the pricey side but I knew that going in of course. Was definitely a great dining experience."

Knowledgeable and friendly.  Not intrusive and not aloof. The perfect host. \n\nFood: \n\nScotch Egg- Oh so rich and good. I've never had a Scotch Egg before and it was exactly how i imagined it would taste. Fantastic. \n\nRoasted Beet Salad- Did not like. Overpowering flavors. The everything bagel soil just ruined it for me. That, in addition to the house cured salmon.. ugh too much. \n\nScallop Risotto- This was interesting. The risotto was a squid ink risotto making the color black. The smell was a bit much for me on this one. However, the flavor was rich and decadent. My dinner companions thought the risotto was the tiniest bit undercooked.... i didnt think so. The rice was swelled to the fullest and yet was al dente.\n\nRoasted Beef Wellington- Gordon Ramsey is known for his Beef Wellington and deservedly so. I've never had anything like this before. Melt in your mouth. This was absolutely wonderful. \n\nPear Tarts-  It was good but nothing spectacular imo. \n\nWith this menu you get a signed limited edition photo of the Hell's Kitchen winner, another chef and Gordon Ramsey. \n\nIs it worth the $145? Depends on how curious you are about his signature dishes. \nI would never get it again... but i'm glad i tried it. They have an impressive steak selection that your server will show you. They have an entire steak that is the marbled part of the ribeye. Looked amazing. \n\nTL;DR\nBeef Wellington is out of this world. Pass on the tasting menu. You can see the Hell's Kitchen winner working in the open kitchen. Very much a tourist/fan dining experience."

Hostess said they only hold reservations for 15 and if we didn't make it within the 15 minute window we would lose our table. She was a bit rude. Yikes!!! 4th of July in Vegas and navigating the walk from the mandarin to the Paris could be problematic.  But we did make it with 5 to spare. We discussed this policy with the general manager when we arrived and he confirmed what the hostess told us. Apparently there is no forgiveness on their policy even on the day of the year that has more peeps in Vegas than New Years (almost 335000). In fact he somewhat defended her but then apologized.  he did offer to make it up to us with dessert but that was the last we saw of him and when it came time to order dessert our waiter never made mention of the \"free dessert\".  \n\nFood was very good and service was good but probably not to the standards one would expect in a gordon Ramsey property. Wife had filet and was cooked perfectly. I had ribeye also cooked perfectly. BUT,  nothing outstanding. Mastros in crystals was better."

The location at the Paris Hotel & Casino is OK. I would give it 5 stars but I think the price was a little high for a steak house. We were a party of four celebrating my birthday. We started with the market green salad, asparagus soup, caesar salad, and the fried oysters for an appetizer. The fried oysters were amazing, the market green salad was good but not spectacular, the asparagus soup was spectacular and the caesar salad was excellent. Our entrees were, the kobe beef rib cap, beef wellington for one, bone in new york, and a shrimp cocktail. The rib cap and new york were both excellent, the beef wellington was my order and I thought it was good but as often as I have seen it cooked on his TV show Hell's Kitchen I expected it too come out perfect. It was cooked just right but was sort of lukewarm like it had been cooked a while ago. So overall the meal was very good. For dessert we shared the sticky toffee pudding which was absolutely amazing. We had read that the service was not so great but we found the service to be outstanding throughout the entire meal. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend."

He's right- the place has pretty much nothing English about it and is a two story glass box, but I did like the welcome; upon approaching the Host desk, you are greeted by a half dozen Identical 6 foot tall brunettes in the same little black dress. I thought I'd wandered onto a Robert Palmer video set! (lf you haven't heard of him you betta ax somebody!). We were then escorted upstairs to a rail side table overlooking the bar and entrance areas as well as a spectacular  chandelier- type lighting fixture. Very well appointed room and tables.\n\nWHEN YOU GO- We started with the gnocchi and fried oysters. Both were very good with the oysters being my favorite. Perfectly crisp and juicy at the same time, I could have had three plates of those and been very happy. I also had the filet, which was the best I've ever had and I've had a few steaks. I usually order either a rib eye or Porterhouse, but was advised to try the filet by our outstanding server Mathew. And he was right! Perfect medium rare, juicy and flavorful to the last bite, it was incredible. Wifey had the Wellington which was very good, but I found the sauce to be a little salty and the philo didn't stand up to it very well. Good flavor and the meat was perfectly done. We also had the toffee bread pudding and if I could change one thing about the meal it would have been that. I'm not much of a bread pudding fan but after Matthew's home run with the filet suggestion, I followed his lead on this one. Very sweet, and the bread was saturated to the point of nearly being mush. I'll be going for the apple tart next time (my wife wins again!).\nAll in all a five star experience for me. Hope it is for you too!"

Service, food, and atmosphere.   I had the Hell's Kitchen sampler.   There may be other meals less pricy, but I wanted a little of as much as I could get.   Octopus salad, scallop rizoto, beef wellington, and the dessert of all desserts the sticky toffee pudding.   Oh my gosh, that was the ultimate ending to a great meal.

A lot of flavor going on, was thrown a bit by the distinct taste of the dijon but it was cooked perfectly\nCaramel \"Banoffee\" - a light and perfect finish\n\nThere are some things that stood out for me:\nFirstly I have to say we had excellent service from the team of Donnie C. and Sean C. It was Sean in particular that made the whole experience amazing. He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and he was super awesome to talk to (hope you get out to B.C. Sean for some great skiing) If you want great service request them by name when making reservations and you will surely get one of them.\nSecondly, we were really impressed with the wine list that was given to us on an iPad. You can take a peak at the list plus view pictures of the bottles. Also, there is a wine guy. Yup, one guy that serves the wine and explains what you have ordered.\nThirdly, I love the apron design on the bus boys and the belt on the back of the waiters vests. Classy!\nThank you Steak for a perfect dining experience\nAnd thank you Donnie and Sean, we had an incredible night!!"

            "review": "Consistency can be an issue with many restaurants, but maybe not with Gordon Ramsay Steak? As amazing as my first meal was, I think the second was even better. The seating was definitely better this time around. It helps to ask for a good table and that's exactly what we did. Others have complained about the volume of the music, but it wasn't a problem when we were seated on the second floor in a semi-circular booth. You can't beat that -- comfy digs and a nice view overlooking the dining room.\n\nActually, the only thing that trumps that is amazing food. We started with a dozen small, plump kusshi oysters ($42) that were both mild and delicious. They were accompanied by a cocktail sauce, ponzu sauce and a third which I can't remember.\n\nThe best way to dine is to eat family-style so you can sample multiple dishes. After devouring the oysters the beet salad was next. All of the dishes are so beautifully plated and this was no exception. Paired with salmon and bagel crumbs, among other things, it was an unusual mix of flavors that were perfectly in sync. Light, yet bold with a balance of acidity, tartness, and bitterness, it was a worthy way to continue our meal.\n\nThe four of us split two steaks. First up was the royal long-bone chop ($105). A massive 32 oz. cut that they presented right after it was cooked, then brought back to the kitchen to slice so it would be easier for us to share. Thick and savory, this steak is best described as a man's man's steak. It was a grass-fed slab of beef, which was evident in its beefiness and coarser texture. It was amazing and completely different from the second cut -- the American kobe rib cap ($58). At 8 oz. it looked tiny compared to the royal long-bone but packed the \"fury for flavor\" that the restaurant's signage boldly markets. The buttery taste and supple texture was like combining the best attributes of a filet with that of a rib eye.\n\nAlong with the beef, a side of Alaskan king crab legs ($40) was ordered. Too many places overcook them, but these were the most delicate and sweet chunks of crab legs I've had.\n\nThe mac and cheese ($13) was tasty and the brussel sprouts were delicious, especially with the tiny bits of ham sprinkled throughout the dish.\n\nThree desserts were ordered. The weakest of the bunch was the carrot cake. It was a tiny square of cake on a rather sloppily presented plate. It was quickly forgotten after indulging in the other dishes. I don't remember the name of the cake-like apple dessert, but it was excellent. And finally, the sticky toffee pudding... damn... I don't know what else to say. As much as others rave about it, it was better than expected. The rich, dense, sponge-like texture combined with the toffee sauce and brown butter ice cream formed the perfect storm of desserts. It satisfied my sweet tooth every conceivable way... texture, taste, smell, contrasting temperatures... forcing my tastebuds into submission.\n\nAfter two amazing visits, I don't know how this restaurant could impress me again. But, I'd love to come back and let them try. Every cut of beef has been excellent, desserts are just as good and appetizers and sides would make most other restaurants envious. Consistently great food and service (not to mention the celebrity chef factor) have made this spot one of the hottest on the Strip and the buzz for it is definitely justified."

            "review": "Went here for dinner last Wednesday night to treat myself to an Early birthday dinner. Have been waiting about a year to try this restaurant, so my expectations were pretty high.\n\nMy husband and I had reservations for 6:15pm. We arrived a few minutes before to check in. The hostess verified our reservation and directed us to our table. as soon as the door opened it was if we walked into a loud nightclub. The combination of guest noise plus the loud rock music playing created a very loud environment. Definitely not on par with other Vegas steakhouses with their quiet jazzy vibe. The hostess before seating us pointed to the ceiling which had a squiggly mess of neon lines on the ceiling. She described that it was the hand movements of Chef Ramsay making a beef Wellington. Were we supposed to be impressed like it was a Picasso painting? It looked like something a 2 year old scribbles on paper with a crayon. Had to be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a restaurant.\n\nWe were seated at our tiny table. One thing of note is that the tables are open with no privacy, fairly small, and right next to the people next to you. Definitely not a place for a romantic date. It didn't matter. It was so loud i could hardly talk with my husband anyway. The waiter greeted us promptly and went over the menu in detail, and also handed us an I-pad type menu which had all of the cocktails and drinks on it. This was actually pretty neat. They then proceeded to bring us the bread plate. Had a combination of Bread with lemon infused olive oil, a small roll that had bacon in it which was interesting and another regular type bread. It came with a side of Devon shire butter topped with volcanic sea salt. Overall pretty good.\n\nThe waiter came back with our drinks. I tried the HK antioxidant cocktail with Veev Acai Liqueur, lemon and blueberries. Very tasty with a kick. Our waiter then rolled in with a cart displaying all of the cuts of steak. they were displayed in a circle with a mirror behind each one to fully see the cut. Unique and kind of cool. It was just very difficult to hear the waiter, once again due to the blaring music. Can't stress enough how loud it was.\n\nWe first ordered the appetizer of steak tartar. This was pretty good. It comes smoked with a quail egg and alongside yukon gold potato chips. Ended up ordering the specialty, which is the Beef Wellington. It came out cooked a perfect medium rare. The quality was delicious, had a layer of foie gras around the steak followed by a delicate flaky crust. Served with root veggies and a demi-glaze sauce. My husband had the 24 oz. Ribeye. Again excellent quality, delicious and cooked and seasoned perfectly. For the sides we got the fingerling potatoes which were pretty good, nothing really special. The Parmesan crusted truffle mac-n-cheese however was like some kind of addicting crack. So delicious, just could not get enough. And last but not least had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. One of the best desserts ever. It comes out warm with a small container of warm toffee caramel sauce to pour over the top. It comes with a mound of brown butter vanilla ice cream shaped like a stick of butter. This dessert was the bomb. Mouth Orgasm is all i can say!!\n\nOverall the food delicious, savory and cooked perfectly. The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable, however it was very hard to hear them and sort of lagged on waiting on us later in the meal. So just slightly above average service wise. Ambiance horrible for a steakhouse. Extremely loud with the music. Also make sure to get regular water at the beginning. They try to trick you into \"flat\" or \"sparkling\" which is 9 bucks a bottle, and they don't tell you that up front. The restaurant just tries too hard to be edgy and new age. Unfortunately it doesn't work well at all for a fancy steakhouse. Definitely could not have a romantic quiet evening at this place. For the money you spend, you can do so much better at any number of steakhouses in town. Hugo's Cellar, Del Frisco's, Top of the World all have food that is just as good or better, much better waitstaff and customer service, and above all 10 times better ambiance for a upscale steakhouse. Over-hyped for the most part due to the chef."

After waiting roughly 20 minutes we were seated and treated well, similar to all higher end dining, so nothing out if the ordinary. We were giving a selection of breads as an early snack while we overlooked the menu. We started off with the steak tartare, my personal favorite from most top tier steakhouses and I wasn't let down by the one served here. It was presented on a played covered in a small glass top that was  smoked to add a bit of flavor to the meat. Overall very good. For our main courses I ordered the bone in ribeye rare, which came out perfectly to my liking, and my girlfriend order the famous Wellington, which I honestly thought was pretty average. We paired it with the Mac n cheese and asparagus, which both came out nicely. \n\nI think our bill came out to roughly $400 for two, which is a bit pricey, but it also includes drinks. \n\nOn a side note, we had someone next to is that felt that he was on an episode of Hells Kitchen and he was Gordon himself. Yelling at the waiting, telling them the food was crap, trying to explain how to properly cook a steak in the amount of time he expected, etc. and eventually asking for a free bill. It provided some entertainment, and I'd be willing to bet it's a regular occurrence there with the whole Gordon Ramsay arrogant image.  \n\nGood steak, but there are better. I personally would take Mastro's over it any day of the week."

It was soo good we came back the next night after eating at Scarpetta just for dessert. Went straight into the lounge, sat down and enjoyed it again.

We had a reservation at 10 are arrived at 9:30. the hostess instead of telling us to come wait inside, have some drinks blah blah blah LITERALLY said \" ok we will seat you at ten'\" leaving us to sit around twiddling our thumbs for half an hour outside. \n\nThen we got inside and the whole thing felt like the epitome of tourist trap, which it is. There was a nightclub theme and music to classy food and prices. Our server was young and inexperienced with fine dining, being very forcefully and rehearsed. I liked his assistant better. \n\nWe were a party of five and each of us ordered two or three things so we had a very good spread and variety of food. I tried it all from the mac and cheese to fried string beans. From lamb to rib cap to wellington to foie gras. Let me just say that nothing was memorable or recommendable. I was soooo disappointed, I actually tried to convice myself the food was good becuase of the price and the name of ramsey backing it but honestly it was a no go. Everything was over cooked and bland. No flavors stood out. The foie gras, I actually had to hold my nose to swallow it.\n\nMy brother during dinner dropped his knife and tried to catch it, ending up stabbing his hand ( they have verrryyy sharp knifes). He rushed to the restroom and lets just say no one was really concerned about his well being, more like trying to cover their butss to make sure they wernt gonna get sued. bad attitudes.\n\nThe only reason I gave two stars was the dessert at the end, STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING WAS TO DIEE FOR. i WAS GOING TO GET ONE TO GO BUT IT WAS VERY LATE BY THE END. get it if you love caramel and butter =]\n\noverall bad restaurant, but i stilll like Gordon Ramsey. good luck to the winner of hells kitchen, by the looks of the show the place will get worse =P"

I decided to celebrate and get a drink the HK antioxidante: acai berry liqueur, with blueberries, and something, with a sprig of mint, it was refreshing.  \nFor our entrees and sides: hubby got beef wellington (so worth it, how can you go wrong with meat and pastry), and I got the 8 oz.

Sides: we decided on ( i call it) fancy creamed spinach w/ parmesan cheese, and truffled mac & cheese (with bleu & cheddar cheeses, and peas).  I had the sides as cold leftovers for breakfast the next morning.. still yummy in my tummy!\n\nDessert: sticky toffee pudding (the waiter poured the toffee over the cake part), and they molded the brown butter ice cream into a stick of butter.

            "review": "I really want to give this restaurant 5 stars but some dishes were off that it deserves 3 stars.\n\nI dined here last week by myself.\n\nEnvironment: Such a nice place located inside Paris Hotel. It was spacious, clean, and not so loud. I loved the open kitchen. I was facing the kitchen and saw some fun cooking actions. \n\nFood:\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras* 26\nherbed goat cheese pop overs, gooseberry jus,\npickled ramps. One of my favorite dish that night. Loved the presentation and they give you a large amount of foei gras. However, Gary Danko's foie gras is still by far my favorite. \n\nDemi Roasted Bone Marrow* 15 - this dish was too salty. I am an avid fan of bone marrow and this was by far the most saltiest I have ever had. I don't know if they just like too add fuck ton of salt on this dish but they need to calm down with that ingredient especially for those who have hypertension. \n\nRoasted Beef Wellington* \rServed medium rare\rFor 1 57\r\rglazed root vegetables, potato pur\u00e9e, red wine demi-glace. This dish was also a disappointment. This place is known for their roasted beef wellington so therefore I took the risk and decided that yes I will pay $57 for this dish. That was not worth $57 dollars. The beef lacks flavor. Like it was so boring that I wanted to cry alone eating that dish.. I was so disappointed and regretted wasting that amount of money for a dish that had no exciting flavor. It was just so sad. \n\nBrussel sprouts *13 - this dish was good. However it was a bit too oily. I'm okay with having oily brussel sprouts than paying $57 dollars for a dish that had no flavor. \n\nOverall, I loved the staff. It made my dining experience fun and enjoyable despite of being disappointed with the bone barrow and beef wellington. I'll definitely come here again and ordered other things in their menu. I'll definitely skip those two."

I like that they try to give a feel for why the construction is the way it is when you walk in.  The chandelier is an artists interpretation of how gordon ramsays hands move when cooking a dish.  and the entrance is supposed to be like a chunnel.  The star is removed because when I told the waiter I was vegetarian he looked at me with a really weird face like I was an idiot for coming to a steak house.  Hey I can't choose where my friends want to go.  plus they usually have vege sides which are amazing.  Also we ordered a couple appetizers and desert as no one was too hungry.  The dessert came first then the appetizers.  I mean really isn't that resto 101.  Serve the dishes in the proper course order?  But despite that the dessert was so good I would overlook them trying to sit an elephant at our table, as long as it wasn't eating my dessert."

I was greeted warmly by the hostess, found my party at the bar and had a very nice time while our table was being prepared.\nAfter a few moments, we were escorted upstairs to our table, which was located in what would normally be used as a private room, but the it was nice enough and we settled in for what we hoped for a very nice dining experience.\nBefore I begin with the description, I must say that there were five of us for dinner and we were all dressed in coat in tie having come from a convention.... even though half the restaurant was filled with diners wearing football jerseys, we had not been watching football and drinking all day.\nWe were delighted, at first, to meet Jonathan, our waiter.  He was very confidant and he went into his routine of running our table a few others, but he lost us when he offered that \"he makes a very good living being a waiter there\"  which I'm sure he does, but what was odd to mention.\nEach of us asked about a particular cut of meat we were thinking about but he was successful in switching us all to a bizarre cut that no one had heard of and insisted we eat it medium rare.  Figuring that Jonathan did so well as a waiter there, he must know what he was talking about.  I pondered the decision I made over a mediocre caesar salad that Jonathan said was like going to heavan and thought I might have made a mistake....  The steak came and I knew we had ordered the one with the spiff on it.\nThe steak was charred on the outside, completely raw on the inside and looking around, everyone that succumbed to Jonathans pompous suggestions realized they too made a mistake.\nAs I was not the host, I didn't want to embarrass him and say anything.  Great ambience... perfect for Vegas... the menu looked great and I wish I tried something else, or just gone to Mon Ami Gabi where we usually go and are blown away every time.\nIf Jonathans manager is reading this, tell him to take it down a notch."

(And boy, do they like to upsell!)\n\nTo begin with we had the Scallop appetizer and, let me tell you, it was THEE BEST scallop I've ever had! Note: I used singular there. It was $36 for TWO, so one for each of us (just two \"bros\" for dinner.) Still, I remarked several times to the server this was the best I've had...so he tried desperately for me to order more. I said: \"At $36, I think we're good.\" He tried to sweeten the pot by assuring me they're only $18 apiece. I think the deadpan look I gave him told him that was enough.\n\nNext, my friend had the 8oz Filet Mignon, which he gave me a bite - AMAZING! and I had the Beef Wellington I've always wanted after watching it on Hell's Kitchen for many, many years. It was VERY GOOD. I only learned on his reality show it was made with mustard and thought that was a small component. Nope, you could taste that mustard throughout. Over and over. I'm not a fan of mustard, but I'm also not a food critic. So, to each their own with this Beef Wellington with tons of mustard. Still, it was incredible.\n\nOne downfall, and this was just us, I imagine. We ordered the Mac & Cheese side to share between us. It was awful. Just plain inedible. I told both our waiter and another manager who inquired about our distaste that it might be just us because we do trust Gordon Ramsay's product to be top notch. It tasted vinegary, though that might have been the \"truffle\" ingredient.  They were nice enough to take it off our bill...though, it may not have been their fault. \n\nOverall, it's extremely pricey, the food is REALLY good for the most part and the scallops are worth the trip/price alone. Only...just savor that one you get. A payday/title loan might be needed for a second serving. \n\nGordon Ramsay Steak (/5 Stars.)"

We had reservations, and as soon as we got to the desk out front the hostess took us inside to seat us. Did not have to go to the bar first- as a matter of fact, I barely saw it as we went through, then up the stairs to our huge gorgeous booth. We had a 'dining attendant', Ben, and a waiter, whose name escapes me but he was wonderful. We ordered the pork belly appetizer, clam chowder and beet salads to start, had the beef wellington (how could you not), and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Not to mention 2 plates of the outrageous breads. My husband had a glass of Guinness, perfectly poured. \n     It was all exactly as we hoped, and wanted. The food was perfect. The dining attendant clears your place setting between courses; I got a new fork and knife every time we got a new plate, and they whisk your empties away as you finish. I never felt rushed or pushed on, and I'm sensitive to that. I like to be left alone to dine, and I never felt like they wanted me to leave or anything like that. \n     Yes, the music was a little loud, but so are the patrons, if we'd been downstairs perhaps it would have been worse. We did see Christina the HK winner from season 10, she walked by our table twice to meet a VIP, then downstairs on our way to the restrooms we watched her expedite the food. My husband actually bumped into her from behind on accident and she was gracious about it. If only we'd gotten a photo with her. \n     I absolutely cannot wait to return to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants."

The aesthetic structure of the building I believe was supposed to mimic a train tunnel in London. I thought it was structurally unique.

The minute we got there it was like a show. \n\nWe waited at the lobby for a mere 2 minutes before we were quickly ushered to their upstairs dining room. The hostess asked us if we wanted to take the grand staircase or an elevator. Not wanting to trip on our heels, we decided to take an elevator. On our way to our seats, the hostess told us the large artwork centered above the lower dining room was the hand movements of Ramsey as he makes his famous beef wellington. That amazed us. \n\nWe got to our seats, and it was like a show. Our waiters were dressed impeccably and were incredibly courteous to all our questions. Both appetizers, entrees and deserts were brought out together by a team of waiters. It was all incredibly synced. When they took away our dishes, they did so the same way they took it, all together. \n\nThe price was a bit high up there, but it was delicious nonetheless."

Special thanks to Sandra B from group sales at Total Rewards for making this group reservation for us.\n\nThe meal was everything I wanted it to be - impeccably delivered and absolutely delicious.  I could not have asked for better service.  I would say there was only one thing that may have put a damper on things had I not been in such a wonderful mood - but more on that later.  My husband and I decided to get the Hells Kitchen tasting menu.  We chose not to get the wine pairings since we wanted people to get what they felt like drinking, rather than be limited to what was part of the wine pairings.  The sommelier was on hand to help us out with decisions.  \n\ni personally decided I wanted a cocktail to start out with - though I don't remember the name of it, it was delicious with cucumber and gin and other subtle flavors that made it very refreshing and a perfect beginning to our meal.  \n\nAs with our previous visit, the amuse bouche and third course were exactly the same as our previous visit.  The scotch egg was as delicious as I remember it from July and the Beef Wellington - sublime.  Though I will say after making it with a friend for New Years, I wish I this version would have had more of the duxelles that helps make the Wellington what it is - delicious \n\nThe differences:  The first course was a beet salad.  Perfectly roasted beets with a hint of horseradish and the second course - though it was a scallop risotto, the risotto was made with farro, black trumpets and pecorino cheese (I have to say I think I liked the differences!).  \n\nThough this was not a different course - it bear mentioning all by itself.  Dessert.  How can you not like brown butter ice cream?  Pair that with some sticky toffee pudding and you have the best dessert ever (yes even better than chocolate!).   Heaven!\n\nThe only down side was the cognac service.  I really wish they would have explained to all of my guests what cognacs they had and what the price points were.  They brought out the Louis the XIII for this service ($200/glass) as well as some other much less expensive choices.  Though there were a few people who know cognacs and can truly appreciate the differences in a Louis XIII, I'm not sure if all of the guests that ordered Louis XIII would have, had they known its cost.  For the most part - some only saw the pretty bottle.  \n\nEven with this one slight hiccup - We still had a 5-star experience.  Thanks for a great meal!"

Getting a number to make a reservation for it was a pain in the ass at first though.  I kept getting re-routed because the restaurant doesn't have a main number, it's just a number for the Harrah's hotel line.  The reservationist asked if I had a Total Rewards membership & I said I signed up years ago but I think they expire after like 6 months.  She tried to look me up and couldn't find me, but of course we preceeded as normal with the reservation.  Turns out TR members get a little discount off of most items at the restaurant..& it sucked because I had my TR card in another purse back at the hotel room which I found after dinner.  Anywhoo, upon arrival we were amazed at the high ceilings and the ultra sexy mod look of this restaurant, but bummed that Ramsay wasn't there.  I do get starstruck and I'm a total foodie so it would have been awesome if he was there, but nonetheless we had a great experience.  \n\nThe service was impeccable throughout the restaurant, and our waitress Jolene was so funny and adorable.  We loved how the drink menus were presented to us on an iPad and the beef cuts were brought out on a cart with mirrors so customers could see the marbaling throughout the different cuts.  We were so tempted by the limited edition 4 course tasting menu, but didn't want to be too stuffed for the club.  We decided to share the pork belly appetizer ($18) and I got the house special Beef Wellington ($52), while he got the 24-oz. bone in rib-eye ($56) with a side of the Cafe De Paris Butter sauce($5) & to share the sauteed spinach ($12).  The Kurobuta pork belly was sooo tender and we thought the two little chicharrones were a nice touch as well, it was served with swiss chard and cauliflower puree.  Leave it to Gordon Ramsay to defy your typical bread basket, in front of us was an assortment of different breads.  My favorite was the one with the pancetta of course, because who doesn't love bacon?!  The beef wellington takes about 30-35 minutes to prep/cook, but finally it was presented in front of me.  I enjoyed the buttery puff pastry that encompassed the filet, however, of course.  Some of it turned gray and ugly from the juices and red wine demi glace.  The filet was very tender and perfectly cooked medium rare.  I didn't care too much for the diced up root vegetables it was served with but enjoyed the creamy potato puree underneath the beef.  He thought his huge rib-eye was very flavorful, tender and had a nice char.  The butter sauce though not super buttery tasty complimented the steak well.  I'll admit it...everything tastes better with butter, so I put a little on my beef too!  I was trying to be a little \"healthier\" on the start of our gluttinous weekend in Vegas, so I opted out of the mac n cheese and the fingerling potatoes with parmesan and truffle for sauteed spinach.  It wasn't a let down at all and the portion was quite generous despite the small looking serving pot it came in.  \n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert, but next time I'm definetely trying the sticky toffee and getting that HK Antioxidant cocktail.  I know it's called Gordon Ramsay Steak, but his menu is so appealing and appetizing that I may just get the chicken next time!  A big sexy restaurant, yummy food and great service, Gordon Ramsay Steak is pricey but worth it & there is definitely no Kitchen Nightmare here!"

The husband order primerib and it was thick and tendon! The price is $$$$ but like \"Drake\" says \"YOLO\""

Although they wear too revealing clothes, its las vegas so whatever. \nBefore i came, i heard that the beef wellington is real good. I ordered well-done but it tasted like medium rare. \nITS FUCKING RAW! ITS RAW!\nI was quite disappointed of the taste too, it's not that good, not what you expect from someone like Ramsay.\nShould've ordered lobster wellington i guess."

Treated my niece to what was supposed to be an unforgettable meal, not so.\nShe first ordered the Baby Beet Salad that was very good. Next she ordered an off the menu item called Triple Seafood Delight (2 scallops, lobster tail & king crab). At $95 Scallops were great,Lobster was ok but, tiny and King Crab was terrible! 2pcs. Each about the size of a snickers bar tasted frozen and fishy not sweet & delectable like it should be.   Now on to my meal. I started with the Cauliflower Curry Soup. Very good just the right amount of curry not to overpower the soup. A side of Blistered Shishito Peppers was good but each pepper still had all the seeds in them and I didn't like that. Finally I ordered the 24oz. Bone in Rib Eye it was good not outstanding. $300 plus dollars later... not a meal to remember. P.s. didn't expect to have dishwasher staind, fingerprinted dishware in such an \"highclass establishment\""

I had been talking about it forever! \n\nSo we get there, it's very nicely decorated. But, the music is so loud we couldn't hear each other and we couldn't hear the waiter. He was literally yelling in my face and I still couldn't catch everything he was saying. \n\nI ordered a $100 bottle of wine, only to google it and find out I can get it at Bevmo for $35. I started with the British ale onion soup. It was just ok, in fact I really didn't like it at all but for $16 I was going to eat it. So now the moment I ordered my beef Wellington and asked for it med-well. I was told ,\"no.\" It only is served med-rare. WTH!??? I have waited my whole life for one.... Again I was told no exceptions. I was so disappointed. But I can't stand bloody meat. So I ordered a filet, asparagus, and a loaded baked potato. Filet was good, asparagus was cold, but the potato was delicious. My hubby had the porterhouse which was huge! But cold at the bone. For desert sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. It was the star of the show. The ice cream was amazing! We also got coffee at $12, which was nothing special other than the chocolate liquor spoons that comes with it. \n\nNeedless to say I didn't get what I wanted, it was just ok, and for 4 of us with no booze other than the wine... Before tip.... Was $580. Would I go again? HELL NO! There is way better for less money in Vegas. And you can take your own wine for a corking fee. So in my opinion it was overrated , overpriced, and over loud. Save your ears and money the drama."

I had never had beef wellington before, so I am not sure what I should compare it to. I am not sure if mine was consistent throughout because several bites were delicious, while a few others were more bland. I think it was due to the way it was seasoned. Regardless, every other menu item was wonderful. \n\nI read a few of the bad reviews that were posted here on YELP and became worried, as no one  wants to spend a lot of money on dinner and be disappointed. However, we did not share any of those experiences. It was definitely worth checking out. My thought would be to order some of Gordon's signature dishes, I am not sure if I would come here for entrees I could order everywhere else (since the price points are higher)."

The flavors, the texture, wow it was all but perfect and of course the staff I compare to a well produced broadway play! Actually i believe running restaurants is similar to a live play, the servers should always be \"on\", helpful and attentive regardless what shambles their personal lives may be in. They should never bring that to work.  A good manager is like the director making sure each element of the production goes according to the overall enjoyment of the paying audience and well by know you can begin to see the similarities. And Gordon's Steak was a wonderful, delicious and completely enjoyable performance by his entire cast. It was $55 and I would have been happy paying more for it, to me it was that good! I must add that since i ate alone i didnt try any other dishes, the bread plate and the Wellington were more than enough to satisfy me so this review is really about that one dish and the service!"

However, after talking with some Vegas locals and other friends that have dined at Ramsay's and gave it raving reviews we decided to check it out afterall.  \n\nWe had reservations so when we walked up we were seated right away.  We were sat in a cozy little booth facing the kitchen so we got to watch the action.  One sous chef immediately caught my eye and I asked our waiter if he was from the show.  Yes!  It was Chef Jon from Season 11!  He was more than happy to come sit with us to take a photo and chat for a quick minute.  Super friendly guy.  Anyway, enough of the fan geek moment, to the food!  \n\nThe bread sampler looked fantastic.  Being gluten intolerant I wasn't able to taste it, but my husband said it was very good.  We got the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  I'm typically not a fan of shrimp cocktail, but this was something else.  The shrimp were huge and great flavor!  \n\nHusband got a seafood plate that had scallops, mussels, lobster and other things on it.  The scallops were TO DIE FOR!  Perfectly cooked, OMG.  I can still taste them.  I ordered the filet and it was melt in your mouth tender.  I ordered asparagus as a side because I have to have my veggies.  Even though it was nearly $20 for 10 or so stalks of asparagus (so plenty to share) they were seasoned and cooked perfectly!\n\nSome have commented that the music was too loud in the restaurant.

It included, Bread, Colcannon, Roasted Beets, Asparagus Soup, Roasted Beef Wellington, and for dessert, Tropical Panna Cotta. It also included an autographed copy of the tasting menu which was a nice touch since my fiance thinks Ramsey is the cooking god. I'll go from best to worst. The Tropical Panna Cotta was superb. It had so many flavors. It was absolutely delicious! The bread was also excellent. The Asparagus Soup was also very good. I could have done without the salmon caviar in it-too salty (not a big fan of caviar anyway). The Colcannon (potato and cabbage croquette) was good, not great. Last and definitely least was the Beef Wellington. The small piece of beef in it was good but the coating was dry and had a very strange texture. The glazed root veggies and potato puree that came with it were decent. By the time we got to the beef wellington, I was wishing I would have ordered a steak because people really seemed to enjoy it (I talked to some of my dining neighbors). The staff was absolutely top notch! They were very attentive and knowledgeable about the food. Our server was Chris and he treated my beer drinking fiance like they were old buddies! Him and another server helped him pick out a beer and both of them knew every thing about every beer that the restaurant served (although they did disagree on which one was the best :  ) ) I was really impressed that they remembered every thing about the steaks when they were showing each table the steak selection. I will visit this restaurant again but will order one of the beautiful steaks."

After talking my hubby into coming he made an 8:45 dinner reservation for us. We showed up at 8:40 and were told they were 5-10 minutes behind. She recommended us to sit in the bar. We walk in, by ourselves, to try and figure out where to sit. At first we didn't see any empty seats at the bar top so we looked at the lounge and saw an empty table but as soon as we got more close we realized it was set...now there are a few people standing near this table so if it was meant for a full dinner there definitely would be a lack of privacy!! So here my husband and I are standing there looking like complete idiots because none of the hostesses were nice enough to escort is into the restaurant and explain where we could sit to wait for our reservation. We realized there was another side to the bar so we say down and Alan the bartender offered us the drink menu. We decided on the British Garden. It's Hendricks gin, muddled basil and cucumbers, basil rock candy, and celery bitters. SO refreshing and Alan was very nice! So after finishing our cocktail we realized it was 10pm. NOW  I know when you make a doctors appt. it's never exact. But when you make a reservation at a restaurant that means they will have a table ready for when you arrive! So waiting 25 minutes for a table is just not right!! \n\nAlmost everything after that was fantastic our apps, our bottle, our side, our dessert, our coffee. Everything EXCEPT the 24oz rib eyes we ordered :( it wasn't very tender and lacked the depth of flavor I'm used to with a dry aged steak. I ate very little of it....took the rest home to the dog. I work in f&b and I felt uncomfortable complaining about the focal point of the whole meal! I'm sure our server would have corrected it! But we were having a lovely time and didn't want to ruin the vibe. I'm unsure if we'll return...I mean we were celebrating my birthday and besides the hostess saying Happy Birthday they never acknowledged it further. So that was kinda sad...."

He was funny, quick to offer honest recommendations, and kept our water glasses full, and kept us laughing all night. (In addition, both servers congratulated us several times for our anniversary, AND for the surprise proposal!  Heartfelt handshakes and congratulations were a really nice touch.) \n\nStarting with the soups and appetizers: \nThe cauliflower curry soup with bay scallops was wonderful.  Rich, hearty broth, and perfect scallops with roasted cauliflower flourets, I really wanted to lick the bowl, it was THAT good.  \n\nThe Seared Hudson Valley Fois Gras with herbed goat cheese popovers and hazelnuts with gooseberry jus:  awesome.  Even the pickiest eater at the table loved it!  The pairing of the goat cheese and fois gras was just outstanding.\n\nThe shellfish platter:  just as amazing as I remembered from last time, with King crab legs, lobster tail and claw, GIANT tiger prawns, clams, and my favorite, oysters.  \n\nThen came the main courses, and this is where the service portion saved this review's five star rating.  \nFirst, the good: \nMy fella's rib cap was cooked to perfection, as was the Beef Wellington that my friend ordered, and the 2 rib eyes at the table.  \nMy lobster Wellington was to die for.  It was the best dish of the night, bursting with flavor, beautifully presented...the lobster was perfect, the caviar complimented it perfectly...I was extremely happy with my choice. \n\nThe not so good:  My friend ordered the roasted chicken, and it was DRY.  Really sad.  My other friend ordered a rib cap, mid-rare, and it was practically served blue. \nI was ready to dock a star for that, when Yaron and Sean offered to replace the chicken with something else, and to take the rib cap back for a better cooked one.  \nWhen the two steaks arrived (we replaced the chicken with another rib cap) they were perfect. \n\nNot only that, but when we received the check, they had removed both the chicken AND one of the rib caps.  In my opinion, all they really had to remove was the chicken, but the fact that they took off the chicken AND the steak because of the issues,  that shows tremendous service, to me anyway, and put them right back at the 5 star rating.\n\nDessert was amazing, having the Sticky Toffee pudding, of course, and ours came out with a little candle, and another \"congratulations.\"  \n\nThe perfect evening was topped off when I was able to meet Chef Jon, from Hell's Kitchen 11.  He was gracious, and polite, asking how our evening was, and taking a picture with me and my friend.  \n\nGordon Ramsay Steak continues to be my favorite restaurant in town.  \nGreat job, everyone."

The buser paid more attention to us and made sure that our drinks where filled. I wish he would have be our server instead. My wife ordered spear ribs. They tasted decent but mainly fat and bone. Not worth the price. I was trying to decide between the Beef Wellington and the bone in Rib Eye. I choose the Rib Eye. It was not a good choice. It lacked seasoning and was over cooked. The bone in rib eye is my favorite cut of meat and I have had it other places. It wasn't nearly as good as I have had in the past. The one highlight from our visit was the bread plate it was amazing. But the bread shouldn't out shine the meal in my opinion. I don't normally like to write bad reviews, but this time I thought I should."

It is now my favorite dessert ever."

One downer--the music could have been toned down a bit. It's a steakhouse; the atmosphere should be a bit more refined. \n\nWe ordered the Wagyu beef (the real Japanese stuff). We were going to split ten ounces of that (damned expensive at $32/oz., but it's something I'll probably never eat again because it is so expensive but everyone should try it once) and a 21 oz. ribeye. Our server made a mistake and brought us only six ounces. Besides saving us a hundred and thirty bucks, it turned out that both that and the ribeye were quite enough. The ribeye was probably the best I've ever had and it PALED to the Wagyu.  \n\nOur server (Charles) made sure the meat was sliced and placed in the center of the table so we could help ourselves. We split an appetizer (the pork belly) and each had a side (truffle fingerling potatoes and creamed corn and each side is enough for two),  dessert (the sticky toffee pudding and it's to die for).\n\nAs I've alluded to, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Yes, you're paying for it. But, share an appetizer? Split the steaks? No sweat. Except for the noisy atmosphere, I don't think I've left a restaurant more satisfied."

I started my dinner with an order of the kurobuta pork belly, which was absolutely delicious. It was a $20 appetizer and a fairly small cut of belly, but worth every penny. If you want an appetizer, please order this!  \n\nFor entrees, my boyfriend ordered the rib cap steak\nIt was an 8 oz cut  priced at about $66. It definitely was delicious, but did not really blow me away. The marbling was great and it was perfectly cooked at medium rare. The charr was perfect as well, but if i were to come back I would probably opt for another steak. \n\nI ordered the beef wellington because I mean it is a Gordon Ramsays's restaurant and it did not disappoint.  Im not sure if the filet was an 8 or 12oz cut, but it was pretty big and very filling. The pastry puff and the filling was delicious as well. For sides, we got asparagus which was standard, mac and cheese, and potato puree. The mac and cheese was probably the best of the bunch, definitely had better but it was still good. \n\nLast but not least, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. It was amazing!!! The pudding cake was fluffy and rich, but not overwhelming. Its paired with a buttercream ice cream(?) that was shaped like a butterstick. It was a perfect combination and not too sweet which is what i think is great considering it was smothered in caramel sauce. \n\nOverall, everything from food to service was good. Definitely enjoyed some items more than others. Not sure, if i'll be back, but it was an enjoyable dinner."

The restaurant is kind of dimly lit, but the booths are pretty spacious and roomy. Our server and her assistant were really nice and attentive. \n\nKobe beef. It's $30 an ounce, we decided to get 3 ounces to share. Butter. It's so fatty and melts in your mouth. I think an appetizer portion is perfect, it would be too fatty to eat 10 ounces of this. It was great to be able to try it. It was seasoned nicely.\n\nPork Belly appetizer. Wow, amazing! There were layers and layers of flavors going on. My mouth was happy. It was served on top of cheese grits. Lots of textures, belly was tender. Perfection. \n\nFor dinner, we each ordered a wagyu rib cap. Very tender and fatty, but different than the Kobe obviously. Our appetizer cost more than our dinner!\n\nSides, brussel sprouts, Bearnaise sauce and fingerling potatoes. All cooked and seasoned to perfection. We also ordered bone marrow which was very rich in flavor. They also give you bread to start and all the bread was fabulous. The service great, dinner flowed nicely, we didn't feel rushed and we really enjoyed everything. I highly recommend this place. Yes it's expensive, but if you don't mind spending, it's definitely a great experience. 2 people, with tip, we paid over $300, but we were so happy and that's priceless!"

We were able to try quite a few items. Ordered cocktails from an iPad. The signature cocktail was refreshing and delish!- low alcohol though. My friend liked the kurobuta pork appetizer.  I loved the oyster trio appetizer- fresh and tasty! The house salad is so refreshing, much better than the romaine salad with whole baby romaine leaves! The Mac and cheese was ok- can be shared.  The loaded baked potato was perfectly awesome. The roasted chicken crispy skin was delish.  So was the braised pork.  I shared the medium prepared rib eye with a friend. The chef sliced it in thick pieces before serving. It was only ok- the exterior was quite charred, only a little pink inside, quite tough.  I was kinda disappointed. We had the toffee pudding with butter cream ice cream. The ice cream was shaped like a rectangle of butter.  So decadent!  The sticky toffee pudding was just ok.  Btw, I lost my sweater there.  It was rolled up in my open bag. While removing my oyster platter, some of the melted ice spilled in my bag.  While wiping up, I took out my sweater to dry.  In the dimly lit room, amongst dark colored napkins, a black dress and dark carpeting, my sweater was swallowed!  :(. Nonetheless, we had a grand time!  Although we were the last seating in the room, the Paris lost and found department reported that a black sweater was not turned in to lost and found."

            "review": "The food was mostly great but service lacked a bit. We were abandoned for long periods of time.\n\nWe started off with the tomato salad and short rib tortellini. They were both good but not great. Then we had the fisherman's grill and wellington. Gordon speaks highly of the wellington and yes, everything he says about it is true, it's quite magical. However, I do miss the sear or char I would normally get from a steak but the beef was melt-in-your-mouth soft. The fisherman's grill was good and cooked perfectly but there was nothing special about it that I can't get at any other restaurant. Our server really urged us to get a side as well even thought I told him I think it will be more than enough to eat so we went with his recommendation and got the mac and cheese. It was nothing special and made with truffle oil. What did Gordon say about truffle oil on one episode of MasterChef? Oh yea, \"One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef\". Even though I don't feel that way about truffle oil, I didn't find his mac and cheese special at all. I've had better at RM Seafood in Mandalay Bay. And yes, we were right, it was way too much food. We never should have let our server talk us into ordering the side. We both had a bite of it and left the rest.\n\nFor dessert we got the melon panna cotta and sticky toffee pudding. The sticky toffee pudding might be the best cake I ever had in my life. As for the melon panna cotta; while the panna cotta was typical, the melon flavor was really refreshing. I'm a big fan of cantaloupe and watermelon so for me, this was quite heavenly.  \n\nFrench press coffee is a must. It comes with flavor spoons: amaretto, baileys and chambord. It was really fun. I'm really glad to see a creative spin on something that's usually quite boring.\n\nI love the space, it's modern and lively. The staff uniform is pretty cool. It's shows attention to detail.\n\nReservations are not easy to get so plan ahead (not on opentable). Wear whatever you want. Some people dressed up but there were also people in jeans and tee. Expect to spend about $100 per person without drinks. Yeah, it's a lot for what it is, but it's Vegas with Gordon Ramsay's name stamped all over it."

When I was planning my October vacation I specifically chose Vegas just so that I could have dinner here! To say that it was a let down is a huge understatement. \n\nWhen we arrived I was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant. It's beautiful! We sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs. I should note that I made reservations several months in advance. They really do fill up, so know that planning well in advance is necessary here. \n\nI knew it would be a long relaxing dinner. I was excited for the whole experience. This was just slow though. We sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approached us. I was dying of thirst! Don't get me wrong, our server was wonderful. I just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours. I was falling asleep at the table. \n\nThe presentation of the steaks is really cool. I've never seen anything like it. My mind was made up months ago though. I knew I was getting his signature beef wellington. It would be a decision I would live to regret. \n\nI started with the onion soup. It was really good, but not hot! I got the feeling it was not served to me right away. It was almost as cool as room temperature. My friends soups/salads were served perfectly though. The salads looked to be the way to go. \n\nThe beef wellington was awful! I ate about 25% of it and then threw in the towel. I guess I'm just not a fan of the baked meat? It was tender but I just couldn't get over the off taste of it. It literally tasted like I came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven. The pastry fell apart and didn't stay on the meat. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be though. I just sat there wishing I had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead. \n\nWe did a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts. Both were good. Those are hard to screw up though. I do regret not trying the Mac and cheese. That sounded good. \n\nI had been looking forward to dessert here for months! Timing was an issue on this one though. By the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed! No joke. I couldn't keep my eyes open. We had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back, but threw in the towel and went to bed. \n\nIn the end I received over a $400 bill for a dinner I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities. At least I have that memory. I won't be making the mistake of ever going back."

            "review": "In the fabulous Paris Hotel lies Gordon Ramsay's new \"Steak\" restaurant.   Being a huge fan of Hell's kitchen and knowing next week's winner will be the new head chef at Steak, we looked forward to checking it out and having the ultimate Ramsay experience.   And, we were treated so special...  We let the hostess know we were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary and she made sure we had a fabulous table with a good view of the \"pass.\"   However, I must admit we were a bit overwhelmed in the beginning of our lovely evening.  Our waiter seemed a bit pretentious and made a daring attempt to talk us into an expensive bottle of Californian wine.  When he failed, he sent over the Sommelier who took his shot.  We are not fans of domestic wines and prefer imports.  It took a while, but we were finally in charge of the \"iPad\" used as the wine list and we found a Malbec that we thoroughly enjoyed.   And, then there's the huge steak display wheeled out with a very long dissertation about each cut and Ramsay's preference.   As well, there is a special menu for two that is covered and comes with a parting gift of the menu and Gordon's photo.  I think this is all a bit much.  You don't feel you have time to look over the menu and savor the thought of each bite you might be taking - part of the fun of dining out.   Finally, with our choices made and ordered, which included onion soup, beef wellington, kobe strip steak, haricot verts and spinach gratin, we began to enjoy the life of the restaurant.  It is well-designed with something for everyone.  There are areas that seem more formal, which is where we were seated, more causal tables, a barstool-type sitting area, and tables upstairs with a view of the entire room.   Color is a striking red, which I love and the ceiling is a huge interpretation of the red and blue English flag with a free-style red argon-style light chandelier.  Tables are well-placed, not too close to each other, but one improvement could be made - which was agreed upon by us and our waiters..... the music is too LOUD.  I do not want to compete with  music and our conversation and I don't want the waiter to have to shout at me.   The place has a hip and cool vibe, but loud music doesn't make it so.  It's not required or desired by most.   But, let's get back to the food - it was delicious!!!   I ordered the house special steak sauce as an accompaniment to my steak and it was so tasty.  It almost reminded me of a Memphis BBQ sauce, but a little more smokey.   The English version of a French onion soup was sooooo good.  What a way to start off your meal!   And, the bread tray with Devonshire cream butter was fantastic.   The Wellington was cooked to perfection and John really enjoyed it.  Me, not so much...... sorry I don't like rare meat or pate.  My steak, which according to the waiter, is Ramsay's choice, was delicious.  I ordered it medium and for the most part it was cooked to my liking, until I got to the middle which was rare - just the way my hubby likes it - so he had an added bonus to his plate :)   The haricot verts (a french green bean I love to cook) was surprisingly battered with a light tempura and fried - very yummie!   The spinach was good - I liked the crispy, cheesy topping, but a bit too creamy for me overall.   We were so full, we opted to wait for desert and cocktails at another location later in the evening.   The only surprising thing for me was the bathroom - he, he - only girls would care.......  It is VERY tiny.  In fact, the doors to the stalls almost hit the toilet when opened and they are very narrow.  So, if your a bit oversized, I'm not sure you could even get in there.  Very weird.  And, it was not very elegant - something you just expect in a high-end restaurant.  Oh well, in & out is what you'll want to experience from that standpoint.   But, we had a great time.  Oh, another thing that was so surprising is how CALM the chefs and the pass is - it is nothing like the show Hell's kitchen.  There is no one looking like they are confused or lost.  They all look like they are on vacation, running a well-oiled machine.  I'm sure that's the way it is suppose to be, but it was funny - not what you would expect knowing Ramsay's expectations and flamboyant style!"

The decor is UK at its best, decorations and design heavily influenced by London. \n\nThe food was AMAZING. We had the following: \nAppetizer: Chorizo stuffed Main Lobster. A small lobster tail with chorizo inside served with a sauce and root vegetables. It was VERY tasty, perfectly cooked. \n\nBread plate: I can't leave this out, everyone gets one but it was very good. An assortment of different breads and butter. \n\nBeef Wellington (for 1) split: So, we were confused by the for 1, for 2. Basically, the for 1 is baseball sized and for 2 is softball sized. If you split it they just cut in half and serve on different plates. Its served medium rare. I usually get medium BUT this was PERFECT. Im talking total perfection. This dish was great. Totally worth the money! Its served on a little potato puree and some root veggies. \n\nDesert: Sticky toffee with ice cream. Pure bliss. can't go wrong here. The ice cream looked like a little stick of butter. Toffee cake was so moist. \n\nThis was an expensive meal but WORTH every penny! Service was impeccable as there were tons and tons of people working there. Water boy. Bread person. Wine guy. Managers. Servers. I joked that there were more people working there than eating there (even though it was packed, every table sat)."

I called in advance( recommend) to make a reservation. \nWe eat out a lot and always say we need to start blogging about where we eat and the experience. To tell you the truth our taste buds have been bored until we got to Gordon's steakhouse. When you walk in the door (tunnel) you immediately get a warm welcome. We waited in the full service bar until our table was ready. The wait staff was very kind, happy, busy and many people were eating at the bar. We had a glass of wine and shortly after went to be seated. The restaurant is beautiful. Our waiter was fabulous, and attentive. I loved the palate of cuts of meat and very descriptive discussion of each. I loved that i could see the kitchen hard at work. They made sure each person at the table received their plate at the same time, two, four or six people! The plate was placed down and our waiter began his description of each dish. We had mouth watering filet's, creamed spinach, mac and cheese to die for. Oh and a plate of bread, small samples of many kinds, which i never got passed the bacon bread it was so delicious. Our bellies (full of course ) we would try the sticky toffee pudding ( house favorite) and you will know why when you try it.  It is so worth the money because we can not stop talking to our friends about it. A must in Vegas. Hope he opens one in Houston. Enjoy"

I ordered the lobster Wellington and it was alright.  Nothing to rave about. \n\nWe also ordered the baked potato ( over cooked) and asparagus. The asparagus was amazing!! ( another star). \n\nMaybe I didn't order the right dish and went on a night they were extremely busy. However, i'm open to trying this place out again the next time I'm in Vegas."

            "review": "Gordan Ramsay Steak met all of my expectations with ease. The service, drinks, food and ambience were exactly what I would expect when having to make reservations a month in advance to eat at a restaurant. \n\nMy husband and I had our 6 year old son with us so we asked for the earliest reservations possible and they gave us 4:30pm even though the restaurant didn't open until 5pm. We checked in with the hostess at 4:15pm and just hung around the entrance chatting with other guests until we were seated at 5pm.....45 min in the middle of a casino goes by fairly quickly! We ordered drinks and appetizers (I had a salad) and the waiter brought out a sampling of different breads before getting to the real deal. For the main course we ordered beef wellington for two, mac & cheese, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and potato puree....everything was delicious! For dessert our assistant waiter (Ted, I think!) told us that we couldn't go wrong with the sticky toffee pudding and due to my husbands hesitance he offered to pay for it if we didn't like it. Needless to say, we loved it and despite already feeling stuffed my husband finished one by himself while my son and I shared another. \n\nWe were there for almost 3 hours but never made to feel like campers and our waiters went out of their way to make our 6 year old comfortable and part of the experience. I can't wait to visit this place again and until then I'll be dreaming of beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding!"

            "review": "LOCATION: I didn't like the location of this restaurant. It was difficult to find and from the exterior, looks rather tasteless. Thankfully, past the doors, it gets a little more interesting. We had dinner reservations at 6:30pm for my husband and I celebrating our anniversary and we arrived 10 minutes early and were seated promptly.\n\nSERVICE: Fantastic. Our waiter was kind and efficient. At one point, my husband dropped his silverware and before he could finish picking it up, our waiter was delivering him a new clean fork. Superb! The only downside here was that our food took quite some time to come out.\n\nFOOD: We started off with soup since we had to wait for our food. My husband had the onion soup and said it was amazing. I had a potato caviar soup that was fantastic. The tray of breads was by far the best pieces of bread I've ever had. We ordered wine and the portions were OK, but for the price, they could afford to be slightly more generous. I had the Beef Wellington, which cut like butter. It was phenomenal. My husband had a steak of some sort, can't quite remember what cut but he said it was just OK, not the best he's had. We also ordered the Mac N Cheese and that's where I was a bit disappointed; it didn't taste like anything. It lacked salt and definitely a cheese flavor. We didn't have room for dessert, unfortunately.\n\nOTHER TID-BITS: I did get to see Christina checking dishes while I passed by to the restrooms. Restrooms are tiny. I think the women's restroom under the staircase only had 3 stalls and they weren't very nice. The price for the dining experience was just OK, with a $200 bill for 2 people I was expecting a little more, but the Wellington is what saved this review from being a standard 3-star."

            "review": "Okay. I won't go into detail about our entire experience, but I will point a few things out that I would like to have known pre-dining. We had a reservation and I am glad we did. This place was packed. We sat upstairs, right next to the staircase so we were able to not only look over the entire room, but we got to watch the food servers struggle to carry all of the food up the stairs for every table on the second level. Very entertaining. This place is open and loud and the club music that is piped-in only adds to the noise level. When your waiter asks if you would like a bottle of sparkling or plane water you may also opt for a bottle of house or tap water. We were not given the third option, but when asked if we would like a second bottle I asked about the different looking bottle that sat on a few surrounding tables and was informed that that way \"just tap water\", to which I replied \"We will have one of the tap waters\". Not a big deal, its done everywhere but GR bottled water is 8 bucks a bottle. That cuts into my cocktail budget. Our apps and steaks were perfect. We each ordered an addition of marrow for our steaks. One would have been enough for both of us. Kinda felt like the Fintstones with two BIG plates of at least 4 marrow bones, 4 to 5 inches each squeezed onto our 2 top with cocktails, entrees, bottle of water (tap) and water glasses. Server was a bit robotic, but the well prepared food was good enough to overcome that flaw. Pricey as expected. A great meal all around."

            "review": "We stopped in here for a quick dinner last week. I can't agree with what everyone else seems to think about the restaurant being beautiful as my first thought as I sat down was how hideous the design was. Just really gaudy and tasteless, and sadly not very British. Well it is Las Vegas so I guess thats what you expect. They were playing some terrible big room house music which was a pain on the ears. Seriously, it's hideous. \n\nService was really good. We had a waiter and he had a sidekick. He bought out a magical steak wheel that looked kind of like the wheel of fortune and each stop was a different chunk of cow. It's an interesting way to display the cuts they offer. I spun the wheel and it landed on a bone in Rib Eye at about 62 bucks.\nOrdered that, with a side of creamed spinach and chips. There is no chips on the menu but they did us some anyway. They came out absolutely drenched in truffle oil. Complete overkill. Asked for some without, which were nice. Call me mad but truffle oil on fries? No thanks.\n\nThe steak was bloody spot on. Huge. Cooked exactly right. Great marinade, great char on the right bits, great marbling and just super tender and tasty. Remember order 1 shade under for USA. If you order a medium in the UK, ask for a Medium Rare. Can't have been happier with the steak. \n\nOnly one complaint really. It's that old chestnut where you order a Coke and they say 'is Pepsi ok?'. No. Pepsi is never ok unless you ask for Pepsi. I don't care about your deal with Pepsi or whatever you thought was a good idea when they were throwing money at you to only have Pepsi. I want Coke when I ask for a Coke.\n\nGreat meal though, would definitely go there again if steak was on the brain."

It's pricey of course, but hey, you're in Vegas right?\n\nWe were led by our hostess up the stairs and were seated in a nice cozy booth. Our waitress was really nice and she recommended some dishes. She also brought in samples of each cut of meat, it was an exquisite sight to behold actually haha\n\nWe all ordered drinks and we were given bread to start off with. My favorite was the lemon thyme ciabatta and then the mushroom brioche roll. It comes with butter and volcanic salt which adds a nice flavor.\n\nI was set on getting the beef Wellington because I wanted to find out what this hullabaloo was really about and if it was really that good. My bf got the rib cap and his friend got a 24oz bone in rib eye. We also got sides to share: mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes and fried okra. All meats were terrific. The Wellington really WAS great. The puff pastry was golden brown and the meat was cooked perfectly, a juicy medium rare. I can see why it's one of his signature dishes. I must say though, my bf's rib cap was the best. It was really tender and I loved the slight char it had. \n\nAs for our sides, I was scared that the Mac and cheese would have a too overpowering blue cheese flavor, but to my delight, it was more truffle-y which I enjoyed. My second favorite side was the fried okra because it had a slight spice to it which elevated the dish. Finally, even though we were full, I had to order his sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. It was huge and so delicious. If I hadn't just eaten a Wellington, I would've devoured the whole thing! The ice cream was so rich and they pour toffee/caramel sauce and leave some in the side for you to add more or less. So delightful.\n\nProbably gained 10 lbs from that meal but I have zero regrets!"

I was ready to play the 'being from Canada' card but the ladies at the front could see the frantic look on our faces & seated us (we had reservations). I am thankful for the front desk staff b/c it states everywhere not to be late & we were (lol). My husband was grumpy with me because the whole purpose to our trip was coming to Ramsay's restaurant! Regardless of all the drama as soon as we were seated the atmosphere & staff welcomed us and we both began to relax. We enjoyed our evening & were taken care of by the staff- ALL OF THEM! If we were low on water or drinks, they were refilled immediately! The FOOD...both my husband & I agree: no words to describe it- worth every penny. We were going to try the Hell's Kitchen Menu but I cannot eat that much so we decided to just order off the menu. We had the wellington's (freakn' AMAZING)! I have never had lobster (I dislike fish) but decided to venture out & had the app. Again, so good! We polished off as much as we could & what we couldn't finish we took back with us to our hotel room. Gordon Ramsey's food is even better when you reheat in a microwave & enjoy (I know typically you are not suppose to do that). We loved the food, staff & the experience! Thank You all for your hospitality! We are coming back to Vegas at Christmas time so I hope we can book another evening at Ramsey's restaurant!\nAgain, thank you all for taking such good care of us!\n\nFatima & Mark"

            "review": "TLDR: Order the onion soup, scotch egg, foie gras, kobe filet and sticky toffee pudding with a slice of cheese cake on top. Ask for Thomas.\n\nThis review is a compilation of 3 (yes 3) visits made over the course of a 1 week stay in Vegas. During this time our group sampled nearly everything on the menu save the cold shellfish and caviar. Much gratitude goes to our trip's host and hostess for treating the group to this experience.\n\nAmbiance / Decor: As others have mentioned, the design of this place is excellent. Well thought out style, we really liked the tunnel feel as you walked through yet were able to observe everything from the top floors. The music is mostly British rock / indie / pop and was a bit too loud if you were seated in an open table. On our last visit we were seated in one of the semi-circle booths on the top floor. This made a massive difference in being able to hear any see everyone. Request when you make your reservation if your party is 4+\n\nWaiters: Every one of our waiters rocked. Tony, Donny and Sean, each brought their own flare of friendly banter, excellent food suggestions and superb attention to detail. They were careful to explain that the Kobe beef is Kobe-style. It is from Nebraska and the cows there share genetics traits similar to those in  Kobe Japan. So no, this is not true authentic Kobe beef (you'd have to go to Japan for that as it is not exported to the states), just similar.\nWhile eating I noticed that the majority of the waiters looked very similar; white males, late 20s/early 30s, brown hair, medium build. I asked our waiter that night why there were no female waitresses. The answer he (won't say who) gave cracked us up. Feel free to ask, ymmv.\n\nSommelier: I thought our host was going to enter into an intimate bromance with Thomas our Sommelier. This guy can do no wrong. In addition to excellent pairing that you would expect from a seasoned Sommelier, Thomas also treated us to a bit of history behind the wines we tried and was happy to answer questions. Thomas was also sensitive to how much one was willing to spend and made suggestions based around that. Be sure to have Thomas suggest a desert wine, you won't regret it.\n\nSoup/Salad/Bread: Everyone raves about the asparagus soup. Yes it is delicious. But it wasn't my favorite. The onion soup however was a knockout, for a soup it's a good size portion that I recommend sharing with someone if you're going the full 4 course. The Heirloom tomatoes were excellent as well, never had tomatoes this tastee. All the bread was quite good, the butter had this black salt sprinkled on it that gave it a nice flavor. \n\nAppetizers: All the appetizers are relatively small. Kobe sliders (best slider you've ever had) come 2 per plate. The lobster had this sweet sauce that made me want to lick the plate. If you've never had foie gras before, you must try this one. After neatly decorating a mini english muffin with foie gras, jam and bacon bits my friend said the look on my face after eating it might as well said \"wtf, how did they do that?\". Also the scotch egg, I would almost hesitate to recommend this if you've never had one before because it would be unfair to compare Gordon Ramsay's Scotch egg to anyone else's. Do yourself a favor, try the Scotch Egg at the Public House in the Venetian before you come here.\n\nMain Course: On the first visit my date ordered the Kobe-style Filet, as an experiment to see how different the flavor would be, I ordered the regular filet. Upon trying my filet I was wisked away to a magical place of melting delicousness in my mouth, nothing could ruin this for me. Upon returning from my cloud I was offered some of the Kobe filet .. and my world crashed. How is this possible that 2 cuts of meat from the same place but different cow could taste so different. So much more nuance and subtlety in the Kobe-style, it is worth the addition 20 some bucks (hopefully if you're eating here, you're not on a tight budget). \nOther meats also sampled were the Kobe-style flank steak; excellent! Not anywhere near as tender as the filet but the flavors were deep and complex I almost ordered this for myself on the third visit but instead opted for the chicken.\nThe chicken is served in a tikki massala. I've never ordered chicken tikki massala outside an Indian restaurant so I am used to a heavy cream sauce. The sauce in this dish is a little clearer and heavy on spices. It requires a good beverage pairing be that beer or wine to really get it to the next level.\n\nDesert: The desert appears to be seasonal with a heavy emphasis on fruit as would be expected at this time of year. The standout as others have mentioned is the sticky toffee pudding. The cake is drenched in brown sugar deliciousness and accompanied by brown butter ice cream. Everyone at our table after the first visit thought this was unbeatable .. until our waiter on the third visit; Tony suggested that we order it with a slice cheesecake on top of the cake. Game. Set.

And oh my lord it was the largest piece of foie gras I've been served in my life -- very well prepared too.

You enter through a tunnel-like structure and then end up wih the bar are on the left and dining areas on the right. \n\nLocation: (5/5) Gordon Ramsey Steak is located inside the Paris Casino and I like the location as Paris is more towards the center of the Vegas Strip. \n\nService: (4.5/5) Service was flawless other than a slight, 10 minute wait in the beginning for our 9:30 table even though we arrived at 9:35pm. The food came at a seamless flow --  and the next dish was always ready as soon as we answered the waiter that we were done with the current one. \n\nOverall: (5/5) Come here. You'll love it. It may get a bit pricey but it is SO worth it."

            "review": "You can probably call it an obsession but I've watched every episode of Kitchen Nightmares religiously, so it should go without saying that the most anticipated portion of my most recent getaway trip included a visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak. I will preface to say that as I'm writing this review, I will try not to let my love for the man to color what should be an unbiased opinion based solely on the food, service, and ambiance.\n\nIf you walk through the front of Paris, head towards the middle of the casino, and you will not miss its sign, its incredibly red decor, and beautiful hostesses in tight, black dresses. To add to the dining experience, one of the ladies opened the door for us, escorted us in through what is supposed to represent the \"Chunnel station\" while explaining that we were leaving Las Vegas and being transported to England to dine at GR's homeland. Inside the restaurant, a large Union Jack Flag is painted on the ceiling with a red neon sculpture below it depicting Ramsay's hand movements when preparing his signature Beef Wellington. The open view kitchen, the two-story dining area, the bar - everything - was aesthetically breathtaking. The vibe was a mix of romantic, sexy, lively, intimate, and while it didn't feel casual because of the dress code, the guests seemed relaxed and happy.  \n\nService at Steak was impeccable. We were served by an incredible team who were all polite and well-mannered, and each course was brought out in perfect timing; there was no sense of rush/urgency between to turn over tables quickly. After already wow'ing us with a drink menu presented on iPads complete with pictures, ingredients, and prices, staff proudly showed off a trolley to each diner's table that put on display stunning cuts of meats served. Although most of his speeches were scripted, our waiter Mathew was an absolute delight and very efficient. He maintained a pleasant aura that shined through the uniform attire, and he even joked with us as I was signing the check. \n\nLast but not least, I can say with confidence that Steak served us a solid meal including 2 alcoholic beverages, 2 appetitizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert that we shared.\n\n--BREAD: A complimentary bread plate was served to start off our meal. To its side was a circular cut of butter with a deliberate sprinkled line of volcanic salt. The butter was soft but it held its shape and had a little bit of flavor. The grains of volcanic salt added to the texture and gave each bite a burst of subtle flavor.\n\n-- DRINKS: I was told the popular drink amongst the female diners was the strawberry martini, so I ordered myself one while my friend had the Southside. The strawberry martini was a tad bit sweet, and the alcohol was noticeable but not overwhelming. My friend seemed indifferent to his, and there seemed to be too much going on with the mint leaves and lime.\n\n-- APPETIZERS: We were first served the Kurobuta Pork Belly after we were done with our fill of bread. Let's just say it knocked my friend's shoes off because every last bite was devoured and bit of sauce was licked clean. The Mac and Cheese was served with our entrees. It had a creamy and soft bottom masked by a crispy top. The blue cheese, cheddar, parmesan and truffle made the dish heavy, but the sweet peas helped by adding a bit of contrast. The flavor was a combination of sweet and savory best consumed fresh. I say fresh only because I took home a quarter of what was left home, and when I heated it up, all of the cheeses liquified into an inedible, salty mess.\n\n-- ENTREES: I thought I needed some spoiling, so I ordered myself a Japanese A5 Kobe (not real Japanese Kobe beef, mind you). My goodness, it was like butter dissolving on my palate. The flavor was subtle, and the richness of texture was absolutely divine. My friend was kind enough to share with me his Beef Wellington. I wasn't particularly excited to try it because I initially assumed it to be just meat stuffed in a puff pastry. However, I was floored when I had my first bite. I'm told the meat is prepared by being coated in a mushroom paste (\"duxelle\") and prosciutto before being tucked into a puff pastry; the wellington is served with potato puree, red wine demi-glaze, and garnish. Execution was flawless.\n\n-- DESSERT: If we hadn't already been spent from the dishes before, the Sticky Toffee Pudding helped us achieve the ultimate finish to our episode of multiple foodgasms. The brown bread pudding was excellent at absorbing the flavors of the toffee and butter; the insides were soft, warm, and moist. Combined with the flavor and temperature difference of the brown butter ice cream shaped into a stick of butter, the dessert was out-of-this-world. Easily my favorite part of the meal!\n\nIf you want to treat yourself out to something special, head over to Gordon Ramsay Steak. Every detail in flavor and presentation was accounted for and well worth the $300 for our meal."

Decor is one of a fancy uk pub with short skirt tall woman (not necessarily a bad thing) taking you to your table. You are greeting by a team of folks and one has you an ipad with the wine list. Too bad the ipad froze often so no wine for me.\n\nThe feeling is that Ramsey aims for you to eat with your eyes first. Presentation is very chic and modern. I can see the Hells kitchen chef was actually cooking my meal as the kitchen is very open.\n\nBread basket was amazing with the volcanic salt and charcoal butter.\n\nThe deconstructed beet and salad with heirloom tomatoes was the most refreshing of all the appetizers of all four restaurants. Great!\n\nThe steak was slightly over cooked but had decent flavor throughout. The presentation was pretty to look at.\n\nThe french press coffee with Amaretto, Bailey, and Chombord liquour chocolate mixture was very impressive."

To make it even better, everything went almost perfect that night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went there for his 25th birthday celebration when we had planned to come to Vegas in May for Memorial Day weekend. I had made this reservation 2 months in advanced!\n\nWhen we first arrived at the hostess table, we did not have to wait for more than 10 minutes. When we were taken into the restaurant, the decor was really modern and high end. The lights were dimmed, giving it more of an intimate environment. \n\nWhen we were seated, I already knew what I wanted to order (from watching the show and after reading all the reviews from Yelp!). I knew for sure I had to try the Beef Wellington. My boyfriend didn't want to have the same thing as me so he ordered the ribeye. For the appetizer, we had the fried blue point oysters. And as for dessert, we got  the sticky toffee pudding (it was very nice of them to put a birthday candle for him for this birthday, making the dinner more memorable!). Anything that they had put on the table from the appetizer to the bread plate, EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS AND DID NOT DISAPPOINT!\n\nThe service, in general, was great! We did find it very interesting for them to use the IPAD for their cocktails. But at the same time, it had information about Gordon Ramsey and the restaurant. We enjoyed it when the server had brought out the Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu and all the steaks they had to cook for us. The busboy was consistently filling up our water and asking if we needed anything. \n\nOverall, I would love to come back and try everything on the menu (and eat the beef wellington again!). However, I won't be able to afford it since the pricing is a little high. Therefore, making this event and possible future dining events here more worthy and memorable."

My issue(s) with this place: as have been echoed by many other reviews, the atmosphere is not what you expect for a $50 (minimum) a plate kind of place. The service was clearly catered to larger parties, such as the loud one of 11+ sitting in the same room as us. There were times when we would ask for water to have to wait until a new person walked by and we could stop them and ask for some water. The food was good, but nothing to write home to your mom about. I enjoyed by chicken (know that if you order it there is a 40 minute cooking wait time) but some of it was too\" decadent\". Rich with too many flavors at points as if the chef was really trying to show off how to use truffle oil crunchy crap and what not. I do have to say that the hostesses were nice. I just really wish someone would have asked the party sitting next to us to lower their volumes especially when one of them started to get vulgar"

I was unsure if the reviews for his restaurants were being based off of his popularity as a TV personality.  This had me a little worried.  The meal turned out to be pretty spectacular. I had the kobe rib cap and my husband had the wellington.  We share some potatoes.  The steaks are of top notch quality and executed perfectly.  The rib cap I had never come across on another menu so I wanted to give it a try.  Very interesting cut, it has the buttery  goodness of a filet but the marbling and flavor of a rib eye. Outstanding.  He also really knows how to cook potatoes.  I'm a potato snob (if there is such a thing)  he does it right.  They have a pretty solid Strawberry Martini on the menu as well. I would definitely go back if there weren't so many options in Vegas.   The one downside to my meal (husband also agreed), there is a section in the back left of the restaurant, it's almost like a little hallway. We were seated in this area.  Lets just say that the tables are very close together and I got a lot of the waiters ass is my face.  Made the experience uncomfortable."

At first we weren't sure if we could justify the expense - especially when you can get a good prime rib dinner in this town for around $10.  But we decided to spend the money and go for the experience - we live in a rural, midwestern area and they just don't have restaurants like this around here (Red Lobster is about the fanciest place within an hour drive).  We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  For starters I had the British Ale onion soup, and hubby had Maine lobster tail, then we split the 32 oz. porterhouse and a side of mac and cheese.  Sides are plenty large enough to share.  We finished with the sticky toffee pudding (also generous enough to share), which is best described as Heaven on a plate. Even the bread was special.  While the cocktail menu on the tablet was interesting, we opted to spend our money on food and not drinks, so we just had water.  The tab before tip came to $179.  \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was just right - clean, contemporary and classy, but still unpretentious and welcoming.  You would be comfortable here in jeans or an evening gown.\n\nWhat really made the whole experience, however, was the service.  We have never experienced this level of service at any restaurant - ever.  Our waiter, Donnie, was particulary wonderful.  He was both professional and friendly, respectful and down-to-earth.  When my husband asked where the restroom was located, he said \"Come on, I'll show you.\"  All the staff were amazing, from the young lady who seated us (holding the chair and carefully placing a napkin in our lap) to the young man who brought bread and was constantly filling our water glasses.  The food came out at the perfect time - we were never left waiting too long, and never felt rushed.  Dishes, napkins, water carafes were all removed and replaced promptly and unobtrusively.  We never had to ask for anything - every need was anticipated.\n\nWhile the food was wonderful, that alone probably wasn't worth the price we paid.  However the combination of the food, the atmosphere, and most importantly the service made for an unforgettable experience that was more than the sum of its parts.  Definitely 5 star, and definitely recommended!"

All was great, the beef wellington was just under great and a little disappointing as this is one of his signature dishes. I will say our server was great.

            "review": "Gordon Ramsay may be famous for Hell's Kitchen and MasterChef, but I think he should also be infamous for opening up one Las Vegas tourist trap after another.  His eponymous steakhouse is the latest example.\n\nI had a reservation on a Sunday evening.  GR Steak is right on the Paris casino floor, and, upon checking in with the hostess, you find yourself passing through a tunnel (\"chunnel\") from France to England.  Actually, GR Steak is less like England and more like a giant, two-story plexiglass box designed to be only vaguely reminiscent of England.  \n\nThe restaurant is loud and raucous, but I was lucky enough to score a relatively quiet corner table next to a wine cabinet.  At the same time, it was totally awkward when the sommelier would bump into the table every 5 minutes while fetching bottles.\n\nWhile wine sounded nice at first, I ended up starting dinner with one of their cocktails -- the English Garden (Hendricks gin, basil-infused rock candy, lemon, basil, cucumber, celery bitters).  The cocktail was refreshing and easy to drink, but I didn't taste much other than gin and cucumber.  \n\nMy original plan was to order the tasting menu, but the server insisted it was \"overrated\" and steered me toward his favorite menu items.  While waiting for the first course, I nibbled on a delicious assortment of breads.  These breads were so soft and luscious that the English Devonshire butter and black volcanic sea salt (how fancy!) weren't even necessary.\n\nThe first course was baby beet salad with burrata and spiced pecan crumble.  The beets were nice and tender, but, overall, the dish (especially the pecan crumble) was unbearably sweet.  I mean dessert-level, tastes-like-an-ice-cream-sundae sweet.   I nibbled at it but didn't finish it.\n\nThe second course was seared Hudson Valley foie gras with goat cheese popovers, huckleberry jus, and pickled ramps.  This was easily my favorite dish of the night.  The foie gras was juicy and tender, but the huckleberry jus provided some acidity to cut through the richness.  Totally wonderful.\n\nUnfortunately, the entree was a disaster.  I had a small (3 oz) filet of triple-seared Japanese A5 Kobe, which tasted slimy and mealy and un-fresh.  I had it with a side of roasted okra, which was so absurdly spicy that I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of it for fear of burning out my few remaining tastebuds.  The server asked me why I didn't like the food, and I told him the honest truth -- and he was nice enough to take it away and strike it from the check.  He told me the kitchen made a mistake and was apologetic.  I appreciated that.\n\nLast item of the night was the signature dessert of the house -- sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I was surprised that I didn't care much for it, especially since I normally enjoy toffee.  The pudding itself was cloying and syrupy and overly sweet, and the brown butter ice cream was as hard and dense as a cinderblock.  After about 2 small bites, I was done.\n\nA highlight of the dinner was the service, which was very courteous and professional, despite the fact that I might've been acting slightly more high-maintenance than usual, due to my especially high expectations that day.  (In my defense, the eye-poppingly steep prices at GR Steak are more than enough to justify high expectations.)  \n\nI don't see myself coming back here.  The gimmick of the place is fun and there are a handful of interesting items on the menu -- but I think my next trips to Vegas will be steakhouse-free.  There are just too many exciting and innovative restaurants in Vegas to squander precious time at tourist traps like this."

I ended up ordering a bone-in Rib Eye, which next time I'll have to remember to ask the price because I think that bone itself costs  an extra $50-60... Don't get me wrong the food was Delicious!!!   Just wasn't prepared when I saw our bill.  Lucky I wasn't the one paying lol ;P  The sides are ordered ala carte.  We ordered the cream spinach and fingerling potatoes.

My dining companion and I both ordered the limited edition Hells Kitchen menu, of which they will only serve 2000. We were number 249 and 250. We did splurge on the caviar and by far the best presentation ever. The famous Wellington is divine. If you are in Vegas, I highly recommend this restaurant, or better said, experience."

We came for the beef Wellington, cooked medium well only, wrapped in a puff pastry. I think I would still prefer a regular steak but wanted to try something different and it's worth it. \n\nIt was nice that they had a cart that showed off the type of steaks they had in case you're not exactly sure what steak you wanted and need to visually see it. \n\nThe ambience is laid back, casual dressed if you wanted to but most of the guest in there did dress up. The lighting was dimmed and it did get pretty loud in there because of all the group conversations around you."

Gordon Ramsay Steak in the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas is a phenomenal restaurant!  From the decor (I am a Brit so I appreciated the Union Jack on the ceiling!) to the service to the outstanding food, everything was perfection.  The service was similar to high end restaurants such as Boulud in NYC; attentive but not overbearing.  \n\nThe trolley of meat was a great way to introduce the cuts of beef, especially the rib cap with which we were not familiar.  Our main waiter, Donnie, was extremely patient with our endless questions, and we never felt rushed or steered towards ordering something specific.\n\nThe waiters' excellent communication really became apparent when, after I had ordered the Beef Wellington (which they claim takes 45 minutes to make as they make it from scratch) and the waiter, Jose, brought the bread out and explained that one of the rolls had pancetta baked into it and we said we didn't eat pork, the main waiter, Donnie, immediately came out and explained that the Beef Wellington had prosciutto in it.  So I was sad that I didn't get to try the Beef Wellington but very glad I didn't find the pork when I cut into it!\n\nI ordered the 8oz filet instead, against my usual principles because filet is often not cooked all that well in restaurants.  But I was wrong....so wrong!  Cooked to perfection (just to medium), it was the tastiest filet I had ever eaten...and I ate every last morsel!\n\nMy husband and son shared the 32oz Porterhouse and my other son tried the Beef Short Rib braised in red wine.  We also ordered 3 side dishes: roasted corn with lime, fingerling potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  All the food was outstanding in terms of flavor and texture.\n\nAs Donnie explained to us, the Prime Beef is aged 28 days with pink Himalayan salt crystals.  I am not a huge fan of very aged beef but this was not gamey at all and tasted wonderful!\n\nI would have to agree with another reviewer who pointed out the very sad green spinach-like garnish that somehow took away from the sheer beauty of the steaks but this was a minor issue.  Chef Ramsay, when steak is this good, there is no reason to dress it up!\n\nOf course, after this meatfest, we all claimed we didn't have room for dessert but we had heard the Sticky Toffee Pudding was to die for so, despite not being big fans of said dessert, we ordered it anyway.....well, were we surprised!  The bread pudding was incredible, not too sweet but sweet enough, with brown butter ice cream that was served to look like a stick of butter!  That and the French press coffee with the chocolate spoons were the perfect end to an outstanding meal!\n\nThis rounded off a lovely trip to Vegas and we felt very satisfied (and a little sleepy!) as we waited to board our red eye home later that night!"

I walked out of there with a disappointed and unsatisfied feeling, especially in the wallet.\n\nI would normally order my steak when asked as \"medium.\" In a finer establishment, I will order \"medium-rare\" knowing the meat is of superb quality and the chef cooking is or should be spot-on. The steak came out as \"rare\". As in RAW-Rare.\n\nThe side of Mac and Cheese was very good and unique, baked potato was large and average, seafood platter appetizer was mediocre. The platter was brought out on ice disks and I found it odd that the crab and lobster was at room temperature. A member in my group complained about some of the oysters being of \"poor\" quality. Service was very good. Timing of courses was rather slow. Prepare to wait for the food to leave this hellish kitchen.\n\nRamsay, I am disappointed. I have had steak at Morten's and Ruth's Chris.

My friends and I made reservations to dine here on opentable ---super easy. MAKE SURE TO PLAN IN ADVANCE because this place gets booked quickly! We had to have our dinner on a Friday around 4:45pm. \n\nThe menu is thoroughly explained to you so you can make an educated choice. I know everyone thinks the beef wellington is THE thing to get, but a few of my friends have told me it's a bit underwhelming. They even bring out a wheel of all the different cuts of meat and they give you a little presentation on the different cuts. Our server highly recommended the AMERICAN KOBE RIB CAP. What is the rib cap? It's that nice slab of meat right on the edge of the outside of the ribeye. It's tender, beautifully marbled, buttery, and delicious. \n\nOur whole table ordered this! They also had some REAL A5 Kobe beef available for $35/oz, so you choose how many ounces you want (3oz minimum). We each tried a bit of this and wow. WOW. The most amazing piece of meat I've EVER had the chance to taste. They also bring out a platter of different breads with a salty, rich, mouthwatering butter ---it was hard NOT to fill up on all these carbs, Additionally, the bone marrow here was so......fatty, melt in your mouth, flavorful goodness. You get a huge serving and just scraping out those bits from the bone.....I never knew I liked bone marrow until that moment. \n\nOur entire table was silent as we dined on our American Kobe Rib Cap. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. Second only to the A5 Kobe we tried, this was the best steak I've ever had -- and at $65, it was well worth it. \n\nDessert ended with, of course, the sticky toffee pudding...which was the perfect ending. You can control how much toffee to pour on the 'cake,' so it wasn't too sweet. The brown butter ice-cream complemented it perfectly. I DONT EVEN LIKE SWEETS, but this was just.....out of this world. \n\nEverything, EVERYTHING about this place was amazing. From the service, to the food, to each plate's presentation.....Nothing short of amazing. I am a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay --- love him on his shows, love his wit, humor, work ethic, and loved him even more since I saw his \"Ask me anything\" post on Reddit (go google it, he's amazing). I had HIGH expectations for this place and I was not disappointed at all! Can't wait to go back."

As soon as they opened, we were seated in a round table upstairs in a quiet corner. It was a great location with a view out towards the casino and sort of felt like we were looking outside. \n\nStarted off with the bread platter, which had 5 different types of bread. Butter was a bit hard as if it had just come out of the fridge, but the seat salt on top of the butter was great. All the breads were delicious except the last one was the least tasty since it was quite plain and very filling. We ended up getting 2 complimentary refills of the bread, and the quality was consistently good. The butter ended up softening up a bit, so it was also a lot easier to spread. My favorite bread was the cinnamon roll shaped ones.\n\nWe also split 3 sides among everyone, the asparagus, corn, and mushrooms. I thought these were decent, but nothing really to rave about. \n\nThe beef wellington was definitely the highlight of the meal. Filet mignon wrapped in a breading that tastes like pot pie crust is like a match made in heaven. The meat was cooked medium rare yet so easy to cut through and not chewy to eat. The potato puree was a nice touch.\n\nAlso ordered the sticky toffee pudding dessert, which I think is an absolute must try. The sweet date pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, and brown butter ice cream went so well together. Split among 5 people was the perfect amount, otherwise it would have been way too sweet.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we realized that we had been charged for still water instead of getting tap water. That was an unpleasant $9 a bottle surprise and it tasted just like tap. Apparently we ordered 3 bottles so that came out to be $27 for water. It was certainly not worth it. Probably the most disappointing part of the meal.\n\nService was excellent and food quality was great. -1 star for being charged for water."

I thought the steak presentation was awesome and original. Got the long bone ribeye 32 oz accompanied with alaskan king crab smothered in bernaise sauce with asparagus($54 in which i thought was very expensive) I do not mind paying for good steak but its inconclusive with this one.

            "review": "I visited with a couple of friends a while ago. I had the pleasure of enjoying a meal consisting of the Naccarri caviar, Maine lobster as appetizers, beef Wellington and a bit of the ribeye as entrees and the sticky toffee pudding as dessert.\n\nThis was actually my first time trying caviar, and I found it to be very decadent. It was also served alongside miniature belgian waffles and other fixins which served as an excellent pairing to the caviar. The lobster was butter poached and cooked very well. However, I found the accompanying cream sauce to be a bit overpowering.\n\nThe beef Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a nice flakey pastry. Definitely was the star of the dish, as the mashed potatoes and carrots were fairly standard. The ribeye was the best cooked ribeye I've had so far, also cooked to a medium rare temperature. Most surprisingly, I found that the fat from the cut of ribeye was cooked extremely well, as it was the first time I've ever experienced the illusive 'melt in your mouth' phenomena. I've never had a steak with fat cooked like that ever since visiting Gordon Ramsay Steak. The steak sauce was extravagant. It had three different flavour profiles, going from slightly hot to a nice plum-like ending.\n\nDesert was also excellent. I found that the brown butter ice cream (which to me resembled the taste of maple syrup) paired really well with the pudding (an extremely light, fluffy and spongey cake), but the toffee sauce was very sweet. Although I do enjoy sweet desserts, I would avoid pouring too much of the toffee in.\n\nOverall, a very delectable meal. Very pricy, but equally well worth the money. Altough I usually don't eat like this all the time, given the opportunity in the future, I would gladly return for another meal."

I was lucky enough to have won some money at the tables (Thanks Sunset Station!) and we decided to come here as we could afford it now. :P First off, I would advise to call in and make reservations. This place can get pretty booked so make reservations ahead of time. We had the following:\n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras $26\n\nMarket Green Salad $16\n\nAsparagus Soup $18\n\nBeef wellington for 2 $101 (this is not a typo lol)\n\nSriracha Roasted Broccoli $13\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding $15\n\nThe food was amazing! The foie gras was delicious. I wish though that it came with more pickled ramps or something acidic bc pairing it with goat cheese popovers makes the dish too heavy. The salad was very fresh and I liked the \"tomato raisins\" in it. The asparagus soup was awesome and well-seasoned. The crab in it was a great accompaniment. We had to try GR's signature dish which was the beef wellington and it was quite good. Our waiter suggested to enjoy it medium rare but next time I'll have it more done as medium rare was a bit too pink for me.  I loved the sauce though and the potato puree was so smooth. The dessert was great; I thought it was more rich tasting than when I tried it at GR Pub and Grill in Ceasars..\n\nOur bill came out to around $220. The only negative blimp on our night was that they charged $9 for still water which was not even mentioned to us by the waiter. Overall though, it was a great experience. I loved the \"Londonesque\" style to the resto. In my opinion, this resto shares kudos with Costa Di Mare (Wynn) with having great service and attention to detail. If you are looking for a resto to splurge and have exciting food, GR Steak is a good bet."

They are some of the top dinners that I have had. I had made the reservation a few weeks prior for 5:45pm on 11.24.12. We arrived a few minutes early but were seated right away. We were a party of six and were therefore seated upstairs in a large booth with extra chairs on the outside. We were not crowed and had plenty of room. From this level you can look out and see the large glowing red center piece hanging in the middle of the ceiling. Right away you will notice the large wait staff and more than one person helping at your table. I love that there are multiple people serving your table. You never have to wait or ask for something because they always are there. They start you off by providing you with water and leave the large glass bottle on your table. But don't try and fill your glass yourself! They will do that for you the next time they come by. Shortly following that, they will bring the display cart hold all the beef cuts and explain the cuts and answer any question you may have. They will also provide your table with three to four types of bread, which are all wonderful. We ordered several of the appetizers including the fried oysters, two order of pork belly (a must try if you have never had it) and a ravioli. For dinner the most complemented dishes at the table were the fillet, the rib eye, the fisherman's platter and the lamb two ways. Please note that the menu currently listed in the Paris Hotel's website is not correct. The menu is always changing. For sides we ordered the fingerling potatoes, the potato puree, mac and cheese, sauteed mushroom and the peppercorn sauce to accompany the steaks. We ordered three desserts, all fantastic but the stand out for me was the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream and looks like a stick of butter. Our dinner was fantastic. Everything was cooked perfectly and we really enjoyed our meal.\n\nImpressed"

Long story short- ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT! The $57 entree, it was a WASTE OF MONEY! The meat was unevenly flavored, mostly bland and then I had one spot full of salt. The pastry was undercooked and everything just fell apart.  It was not just my dish, but all 4 of us had the same entree and they were all the same - TERRIBLE. We casually asked our waiter if the dish is usually this bland and he said that it was not something he would recommend. WHY WOULD A WAITER SAY HE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ONE OF THEIR SIGNATURE DISH? It was truly upsetting.\n\nTheir wine selection is very good though and reasonably priced so that's why I'm giving this place 2 stars....but even that's a bit generous. \n\nIf you want to try a delicious Beef Wellington...try the link below.

Service was excellent , hostess was Ackward ......I guess they have to explain to guests about the stories behind the decorations but anyway everything else is great !!! We left happy we would come back for another special occasion the three of us bill was 350 so 420 included tips and we didn't drink ;) so yeah....just for special occasion !"

But when I go to a Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse I expect the experience to be OUT OF THIS WORLD OUTSTANDING. NOTE: I am NOT downgrading this for the price -- hello you are at a Gordon Ramsay steakhouse I would expect them to be high and they were but you cannot grade it down because of that. \n\nThe Hells Kitchen tasting menu would have been fun but I just didn't want the beloved Beef Wellington.  \n\nThe service was fantastic -- honestly the server assistant was WAY on top of things so that is why they get two stars.  It was particularly good at the beginning but the minute I mentioned a problem it was like he was personally offended and check out was a bit stupid.  Read more...\n\nBread on the table was good -- so good that I asked for a second plate of it! Thank goodness since some of the other dinner didn't work out so well. \n\nMy friend ordered oysters and said that they were great. \n\nWe ordered two filets and one rib cap.  The rib cap was actually fantastic and perfectly made.  My filet however had some very tough spots and I just wouldn't expect that in a steak at this level.  They were cooked to perfection though. \n\nI ordered truffle mac'n'cheese.  HOLY yum in the first and second bites.  Then it was WAY too much truffle.  To the point that I took some home and I was still tasting the truffle two days after eating it. NO BUENO.  PUT DOWN THE TRUFFLE OIL. \n\nI ordered a caesar salad completely forgetting that REAL caesars have anchovy, which I detest.  So I asked if I could get something else explaining I couldn't do fish.  The server brought out another salad and said that it would be perfect.  It too had anchovy in the dressing.  I am sorry what part of my problem with the first one wasn't clear?  So I sent it back even though he objected saying it didn't have fish.  UM yes it does.  Look up the recipe!!\n\nMoving on... I loved asparagus -- but really?  Can you get that wrong? I suppose... it wasn't though!\n\nMy drink was continually refilled.  That was a bonus... probably worth 1/2 of the stars above.  I would expect this at this type of establishment. \n\nMy friend ordered coffee and it came with three chocolate spoons -- one with Amaretto, one with Baileys and one with Chambord... WHOEVER invented this presentation is GENIUS.  I almost got coffee for this reason alone but then she gave me the \"c\" spoon so I didn't need to.  Needless to say this was a highlight.  Strange that coffee can be a highlight... also worth 1/2 of star. \n\nMy two friends each got dessert which looked good - but I am not a sweets person. One got cheesecake which was gorgeous and apparently tasty. It was a tiny portion with three tiny squares of cheesecake but edible gold flakes etc.. very nice presentation.  The other opted for his sticky toffee pudding.  I did try it.  It was okay.. \n\nPresentation was good -- but if the flavor and cooking isn't right behind the presentation it is just a beautifully wrapped empty package.  The leftovers were sent with me in a cute British bag which was fun.\n\nWhen the bill came I saw that I had been charged for the salads and I wasn't given the TR price.  I asked about both he threw a fit that I wanted the salads taken off even though they were sent back and never gave me my TR points or price.  Honestly if you can't handle a bill let me do it for you.  Its not like I wasn't paying $125 for my meal alone anyway.. but you wanted me to pay $150 to pay for something I sent back?  No... thats not the way it works.  HOW SAD.  Get it together STEAK.  \n\nI have been to so many 5 Star restaurants that blow this out of the water.  The reason I had fun was my friends and the initial fun banter with the server.  The rest I would easily have skipped. \n\nDefinitely save your money until they get it together here!  Not impressed."

Got to the steaks but bf ordered pork belly for appetizer,  beef wellington entree, truffle mac & cheese side and a pepsi. (For sodas, they ONLY have pepsi or diet pepsi, WTH?)\n\nI ordered foie gras for appetizer, crispy chicken breast for entree, chili lime corn for side and an infused peppermint iced tea. 4 stars because my chicken was a bit dry, well, it's breast so I guess that's why. I had a piece of the wellington and OMG it melted in my mouth! I am for sure coming back and ordering me some beef wellington all for my self! sides were alright. and for dessert, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding. that thing was excellent! (needed a little more ice cream, imo)\n\nSlow service to begin with, had a reservation, didn't sit until about half an hour. Great table service, not as excellent, great or whatever else other reviewers say. Maybe because we're Asian/we looked like we had no monies? I observed other tables had better service than ours =/\n\nAnyways, will we come back?! YES, I will give GR another chance! And when we do, I will maybe give it a full 5 stars (for the food/service) when I have the beef wellington all to myself!"

Il locale \u00e8 esclusivo, forse uno dei pi\u00f9 esclusivi in cui sono stato, e curato nei minimi dettagli. Il piano terra ha una parte lounge e arredata in stile moderno in cui le ragazze in nero, che hanno immediatamente charmato parte della cricca (di Dawson, vedi Dawson's Creek sempre senza alcun motivo) con cui ero andato, hanno provato ad infilarci prima di rendersi conto che per quella sera, la prima a Las Vegas, questa eccelsa steakhouse non ci avrebbe sfamato.\nSenza disperare (pi\u00f9 di tanto) prenotammo un tavolo per il giorno dopo e fu cos\u00ec che dopo 24 lungherrime (si, avete letto bene LUNGHERRIME) ore abbiamo avuto l'onore ed il privilegio (ed il pregiudizio, per non farci mancare nulla) di cenare qui, al primo ed elegante piano del locale.\n\nLa qualit\u00e0 del servizio non \u00e8 definibile, al contrario \u00e8 lei ad aver definito un nuovo metro di paragone per i miei futuri Gimme Five (Stars, non la canzone di Jovanotti, mi raccomando). Abbiamo avuto un cameriere che ha portato una grossa ruota di metallo in cui erano posti i cinque pregiati tagli di carne scelti da Ramsay in persona per Steak. Il simpatico cameriere non si \u00e8 scomposto neanche quando gli \u00e8 stato detto che i filetti in Italia sono alti meno di 1cm (WTF! Lo possiamo dire in coro) e si \u00e8 scusato quando la pasta ordinata come sidedish (paese che vai, usanze che trovi) era scotta (vedi ultima parentesi). Per gli alcolisti, anonimi o meno, si segnala la presenza di sommelier e iPad per la scelta dei vini... quindi puoi andare tranquilla Elisa V.!\n\nCercare di descrivervi il cibo sarebbe riduttivo quanto un filetto alto 1cm, \u00e8 giusto che io lo dica. Tutto, e dico TUTTO (si sa, le scritte in maiuscolo sono pi\u00f9 potenti perch\u00e9 seguono lo stesso principio logico-scientifico del \"da red wunz go fasta!\"), era curato nei minimi dettagli! Persino la normale acqua era importata dalla Scozia perch\u00e9 si abbinava meglio ai piatti serviti.\nOvviamente imperatore della serata (il re \u00e8 quello allo zola) \u00e8 stato il FILETTO ALLA WELLINGTON, un'eccezionale esplosione di gusto racchiusa in una piccola crosta di pasta sfoglia (e per fortuna non in un minuscolo spazio vitale, altrimenti tutta la lampada di quel povero genio puzzerebbe di carne :( ) fragrante al punto giusto. Io l'ho abbinato a dei funghi che esaltavo il gusto pieno e completo di filetto, pur\u00e8 e riduzione di vino rosso splendidamente... insomma, se siete arrivati fino a questo punto della recensione dovreste solo guardare la foto che ho pubblicato ed invidiarmi, non avete altra scelta (tanto pi\u00f9 che se un povero Balrog non pu\u00f2 passare per un ponte di certo voi non avete il diritto di NON invidiarmi!).\n\nGordon Ramsay Steak \u00e8 un'esperienza unica ed epica (e, perch\u00e9 continuiamo a non farci mancare nulla, anche un po' power metal) che sarei pronto a rifare in qualunque momento, questo \u00e8 il risultato della mia cena l\u00ec, e non solo... dopo aver provato questo desidero cos\u00ec tanto collezionare tutti i ristoranti di Chef Ramsay che manco Ash Ketchum riuscir\u00e0 a sconfiggermi!"

We had dinner for my boyfriend's cousins birthday celebration so there were about 12 of us. 6 of them got to the restaurant before us and still had to wait an extra 20 minutes before they were served! Reservations were for 9pm and we weren't all served until close to 11pm!! For a group that spent over $1,000 on dinner, this isn't what I would expect. It was an experience I'll at least get to say we tried but I will never be back. I can get my money's worth across the street at the steak house at Ceasars Palace instead. Don't bother spending the high prices for the terrible service."

While waiting at the bar for our reservation we enjoyed the atmosphere, vibes & of course a couple of their delicious cocktails!!! \n\nWhen seated, we were greeted by a very upbeat & enthusiastic waiter that checked on us regularly and made our experience even better than what we could have hoped for! He knew the menu extensively & was able to suggest what he thought we might like (he did not disappoint).\n\nI ordered the potato & octopus salad (sooooooo AMAZING! Perfectly cooked octopus & fingerling potatoes in a deliciously balanced tangy sauce with pumpernickel soil that gives it almost a smokey finish) & the American Wagyu Kobe rib cap (melt in your mouth delicious... You barely have to chew) w/ gratin\u00e9ed spinach on the side (rich in flavor & amazing)! My dinner was sooo deliciously memorable that I'm able to recall my dining experience a year later lol. I can't, however, remember what my husband ordered except for the loaded baked potato, which he still says to this day is the best he has ever eaten in his life (I tried it... Best baked potato I've ever eaten too)! Unfortunately during all that food bliss... I only took one picture & that was of my salad lol! \n\nIt's a bit pricey, but we really enjoyed the food & had a great time! Even better was that the restaurant was conveniently located inside the Paris Hotel (where we were staying) so we didn't have to go far to find it!

In fact, I had the same dish the night before at Le Cirque and, I have to say, I think Ramsay's dish topped Le Cirque. It was larger, had some bits of ham, great flavor. Fantastic start to the meal.\n\nThree of the six people I was with had the Skirt Steak. All three were perfectly cooked, tender, and great flavor. One friend did report his was oversalted. Another friend had the beef wellington which was supposed to be what Ramsay's is known for (it's the entree on the tasting menu). He said is was great but it is quite pricey. \n\nUnfortunately the dessert was a mixed bag. They recommend the toffee pudding dish which is NOT pudding. I generally dislike pudding so I got the carrot cake. The carrot cake was utter garbage. It was terrible. No moisture, no flavor, it was worse than what you get premade at the grocery store. That being said, two other friends got the toffee pudding and what came was actually a toffee cake type thing with some incredible ice cream. It was superb. How can one dessert be so good while another be so truly awful?\n\nAlso, the service was slow. It's a steakhouse so it's going to be a bit slow, and it's Vegas so you know service will be slow, but the dinner took 3 hours. that's ridiculous. We were just sitting waiting for an hour for dessert."

The choice of music, hard rock, gave a terrible ambiance.   Trying to enjoy a pricey steak with Led Zepplin blasting so loud you get a headache is completely crazy.\n\nYou are not presented a menu when you are seated, apparently not to be trusted that you won't read it until the waiter tries to cram every drink and appetizer down your throat. You then have to wait until they roll out the meat display for those customers too stupid to know what a steak looks like.   Overall I rate the service a B-.\n\nI had the rib-eye steak and would rate it's taste and flavor as a C-.  Many a steak has come off my backyard charbroiler that tasted superior.  Also had the brussel sprouts,  were over-cooked or may have been left to cook for a few hours before we got there.\n\nI suggest Ramsey go to school on a steakhouse operation.  My suggestion is he checkout Flemings to see how five-star service, overall ambiance and how a fine piece of meat should be prepared.  If you are considering this place, try another; there are many others steakhouses close by that put this place to shame."

We had a group of 14 and were somewhat secluded from the main restaurant, which made our dining experience positively personal and enjoyable. The food was excellent. There was no rush to get us out. It was fabulous. I would recommend everyone have the opportunity to dine here and be treated like royalty. Thanks to Matthew, Steve and staff, for an unforgettable evening"

            "review": "My family decided to try Gordon Ramsay at Paris based on the recommendation from a foodie friend, and Yelp reviews. The atmosphere was comfortable - contemporary, but not overly elegant. We started our adventure with a couple of cocktails, The HK Antioxidant, and El Matador. Both drinks were creative, and enjoyable, with perfectly-tempered sweetness, and no alcohol burn. We also ordered the Pork Belly appetizer. On my first bite I exclaimed, \"Oh my!\" I love pork belly, and this preparation is now my all-time favorite - tender, smoky with just a hint of sweet teriyaki, and just the perfect balance of fatty decadence! The selection of breads was served soft, warm, and delicious, with saltless butter on the side, and nice line of coarse black sea salt to add as you like. My wife ordered the \"regular\" filet mignon which came with a flavorfully-seasoned crust and a lightly trickled demi glace. My wife doesn't like demi glace on her steak, but she really enjoyed this one. Her only negative comment was that the center of her steak was done more rare than she enjoys. But the portion was large enough to eat around that, and our side orders of corn (with cream and so many flavor additions that it almost didn't seem like corn) and fingerling potatoes (good quality, but tasted fairly ordinary) were enough to leave her satisfied. My wife commented that this was the second-best filet that she's ever had, which was really high praise! I ordered the Rib Cut steak, on recommendation from the waiter and the GM. I usually enjoy a nice ribeye or filet, but I can honestly say that this Rib Cut was the most delicious steak that I've ever had. Also, the service was ultra-attentive, and very helpful. Sadly, the reason that I had to give Gordon 4 stars instead of 5 is for what happened next. My 20-year-old son ordered the NY Strip, medium rare. He received a steak that was done medium, which he didn't enjoy, so he sent it back. They realized and confessed that they had mistakenly given him someone else's steak - a medium ribeye. So after a bit they returned with his perfect medium rare NY Strip. But after a couple of bites he looked disappointed. He said it was \"just okay\". So I tasted it, and he was right. It was very bland. Then he started cutting into gristle. The quality was so disappointing that we just sent the steak away. My wife let him finish the remainder of her filet, and I gave him the remainder of my Rib Cut. He said that the Rib Cut was very tasty, the most enjoyable of the 3 steaks. The waiter spoke to the management, and they removed the NY Strip from the bill, plus they gave us a free dessert, which was also enjoyable. Nevertheless, my son said that he was in no hurry to go back to Gordon Ramsay, and I totally understand. Unfortunately, when someone in your party has a bad experience, it brings it down a notch for everyone, no matter how great your personal experience was. Sorry Gordon, we'll continue searching elsewhere for 5 star restaurants."

The service was pretty good, except the fact that, when my sister order a medium steak and got a medium rare steak and told them about it, all they did was reheat it. At most other high end steak resturants I've been to they take more pride in their steak and make sure it's done right and make you a brand new steak. I was a little dissappointed considering Ramsey has such high standards on his show"

Two days before, they had called to inform us that because it was NYE, there would be a set menu and price ($200 per person) but because we all had our hearts set on it, we decided to keep the reservation. The ambiance was nice but not something I haven't seen elsewhere for less of a price. I guess you're paying for the name in this case which is like most celebrity owned restaurants in Vegas. Food was great. The must try is the scallop risotto! I could eat that everyday forever if I had a choice. But speaking of choice, for paying $200, I wish I had more options for my meal choices. It was a 5 course meal and I didn't eat anything that wasn't good. For the main course, I ordered the beef Wellington only because they're well know for that. I was disappointed though. The meat wasn't as soft as the exterior breading so when I cut into it, it fell apart! The beef itself was a bit chewy instead of tender as described. Almost made me feel the quality was because of mass production due to a set menu. If I rated the cost of the meal compared to the quality, I would give this place 2 stars. But my 4 stars comes from the over the top, exceptional service you receive from ALL the staff. It's incredible how attentive, friendly, courteous, and welcoming everyone is. Our server was amazing. Being a former server, it's so easy to knit pick at other servers flaws but he was perfect. I think is name was Roberto (sorry, if I'm wrong. Came in after the introduction). So with the service alone, you could serve me a mcdonalds hamburger and I would come back for sure. If you're a fan of Gordon Ramsey or a fan of being treated like a queen/king while dining, DEFINATELY check this place out!!"

Me on my mobility scooter and my wife looking directly at the one that looked like she had nothing to do. And she never made eye contact. First she sneezed, then she popped some pills into her mouth, then drank some water, and then unwrapped a piece of gum and put it into her mouth,  NEVER making eye contact with us, it wasn't until I said \"Miss\" did she acknowledge us at all. I asked her \"where was the burger place\" meaning  Burger Brasserie, and she with a very snotty attitude said \"it's in Bally's, I tried to ask again and she repeated \"it's in Bally's\" even though the paris website .clearly says  Burger Brasserie is in their casino..

            "review": "Before I elaborate on the review (and whether you choose to continue reading), all you really have to know are these two very important points:\n1. Food is excellent. Like, seriously guaranteed to be one of the best meals of your life.\n2. Service has gone down, dramatically (And I say this, dramatically. Though, still true!).\n\nThe first trip was definitely worth the 5 stars. Top notch service: very attentive, energy levels were high(high enough to wake me from my hangover), both very important keys in taking a good dining experience to a memorable one. The second time, was an entirely different experience. I wanted to bring my boyfriend here because he's a HUUUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay and I've been raving about the best steak I'd ever had in my life being from this restaurant. When we got there, the hostess checked us into our reservation but there was still a 20 minute wait. The last time I was here, they offered us seats at the bar to wait at but it seems the bar itself has become its own attraction so it was packed and we had to kind of awkwardly stand around instead since there's no real waiting area. After we were taken to our seats, it went from awkward to uncomfortable. Our multiple waiters seemed miserable and our main waiter seemed genuinely annoyed that he was waiting on us. He didn't crack a smile ONCE. I think he even scoffed under his breath when we turned down dessert. However, the food definitely makes up for the attitude. I got the filet mignon both times, and they were excellent both times. It was just as good as I had it the first time around! Very juicy, and very flavorful. It was obviously a high quality cut of meat and in Gordon Ramsay fashion, kept it simple to accentuate the dish's natural flavor. Also, the foie gras is extremely rich and buttery. I almost melted into a pool of my own drool (we no longer have foie gras in California, you see.). Still dying to try his signature Beef Wellington! Will certainly have to save that for another trip. \n\nRegardless, my boyfriend lapped it up. He was too focused on the food to notice the rude waiters so he was very happy with his first Gordon Ramsay experience. We still had a good time so the night wasn't entirely ruined. Hopefully you won't get the sour faced waiter, either! \n\nP.S. It's $9 for each bottle of water! I mean it's delicious water, but we definitely wouldn't have gone through 3 bottles of it had we known."

I always come in and I order the same thing...the wedge salad and the steak Wellington. Today there seemed to be plenty of seating but it was a weeknight at 6ish. I instead sat at the bar to drink while I waited for the food. The bartender was attentive enough as he had other people at the bar and people walking up asking questions. Had a couple of beers and then had the salad which lacked presentation and seemed thrown together. Then I had the main course! I was so excited but again noticed the presentation was no longer the same and the cut was way smaller then I remembered...I might be wrong but the price went down too so this made everything ok. This is still going to be my tradition as long as they remain open."

            "review": "This restaurant review is way past due. Before Gordon Ramsay Steak opened to the public I was fortunate to receive an invite to a preview dinner. Prior to be seated, we had a drink in the lounge. The cocktail menu seemed extensive, but I am more of beer girl and lucky for me they had a nice selection of beers too.\n\nShortly, thereafter, we were seated in the dining room on the main floor. Our waiter was kind and eager to answer our questions. He assisted us in choosing wine for our meal a riesling for me and a malbec for him. We started with a yummy variety of breads - the one with pancetta was a real winner - and then moved onto the sliders, which were a big disappointment. We also had yellowtail tuna which was fantastic! I loved the fresh clean flavors. \n\nNext, the main course was presented. The halibut was nicely prepared but failed to leave an impression. I have had better for much less. The New York strip on the other hand was very good. It was nicely seasoned with a beautiful crust. We added on crab and it was terrible. I actually questioned if it was imitation crab. Fortunately, the side of pureed potatoes were positively scrumptious and the crummy crab became a distant memory.\n\nDessert followed, we were given a treat of chocolate spoons to accompany our french press coffee while we waited for our tea trifle. The spoons were filled with alcohol, it's not something I enjoyed, but I appreciated the playful twist. The coffee was a lovely blend, I did enjoy that very much. The tea trifle, however, was a complete failure. We told our waiter as much as well. The ice cream on the side was very good, but the trifle was dry and bland. Just terrible.\n\nThe restaurant is comfortable, the staff was friendly and the meal itself was hit and miss. Our tab was comped, but totaled $300. In no way was our experience worthy of three hundred dollars. At that price point, the entire meal had better be stellar."

Not only was the food the stuff made from dreams but the service was beyond top notch and if you've ever seen Hells Kitchen you'd know why! Sometimes the seating is limited and only the bar area is available at first come first serve but if you go to the other side of  the bar to the right on the side facing the dining room and kitchen there is extra seating as the bar is surrounded by seats so look there if no other seats look available it is usually deserted in that side. This is a restaurant everyone should visit in their lifetime and I hands down recommend you get the beef wellington because no one will share theirs with you if you opt for the filet instead. Gordon Ramsay is not just entertaining but is a mastermind when it comes to culinary arts! Needless to say my husband and I will most definitely be back!"

We were seated at the table right when you turn the corner to enter the dining room. It was a crummy table and asked to be moved. They moved us without hesitation and the hostess confirmed they get that request a lot. We were moved to a semi circular, table right by the kitchen, which was an awesome table! Service was very attentive, almost too attentive. I had just put the last morsel of my amazing Heirloom tomato salad in my mouth when the server wisked my plate away. It was almost like he was watching me waiting to pounce. My husband and son ordered clams which we small but fresh and enjoyable. They both ordered steak and loaded baked potatoes . My husband said the steak was very good but slightly under seasoned. The potato was massive and I would suggest sharing one. I don't eat meat and I dont order chicken breast when I eat out so I got the Mac and cheese side dish. I had a gourmetgasim like I have never had before. Oh my Gordon! That was one of the best things I have ever eaten. I ummed and yummed all the way through. Fantastic! So despite everything I just said I still only give 4 stars.

Eighteen years old at the time, and now at age 29, I FINALLY was able to try the elusive beef wellington!  What....a.....let down.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love every component of a wellington: puff pastry, check.  filet, check. PATE????? YES FREAKING CHECK.   My wellington wasn't cooked to a medium rare, it was rare... I didn't mind it though, I enjoy tartare and carpaccio.  \n\nDO NOT GET ME WRONG, it was good, it was tasty, but I think I was expecting fireworks and rainbow hearts to flood out of my ears and have actual tears run down my face... nope.  I think I would've been much happier with their bone in rib eye, which looked AMAZEBALLS. \n\nSo 3 girls: what did we get? \n\nEverybody beef wellington: you know how I felt about that\nAsparagus: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOO. It had creme fraiche but...no taste, *cue Gordon's voice*  It was BLAAAAND! \nAnglotti: okay, this was good, but they gave you literally like 7 pieces. I was thinking of that giant bowl of anglotti that I got from Eataly in NYC....and the eataly one was tastier.  The tangy sauce that the anglotti was on was too acidic... the other creamy sauce was magnificent. \n\nMac and cheese: BEST mac and cheese i've ever had.  My friend said she likes my mom's better (and quite frankly, my mom's IS good) but I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese. I could just eat that and be happy happy happy. \n\nFree bread: best free bread I've ever had.  They had 4-5 different kinds. (and fuck my ketogenic diet that day ....WORTH IT)  \n\n4 stars for the service.  The guy happily answered all our questions, even brought over the meat cart so we could take pictures (he brought it, we didn't even ask)  He even explained to us who was the head chef, and where Christina was (MY FAVORITE HELLS KITCHEN WINNER!!) and where Chef Ramsay was and what they were all doing and who takes care of which kitchen (things have truly changed and Christina is overseeing a LOT of restaurants, go girl) \n\nOverall, it was a good experience with wonderful service. \n\nAlso the cocktails... the one with the giant flower with random blueberries in it was the best cocktail i've had."

I cannot attest for what my dad ate (but greatly enjoyed), but the beef wellington was out of this world!  Never had steak \"melt\" in my mouth!  Dessert was absolutely fantastic and we had to finish it off with some fine cognac!  Since then I tell everyone who is going to Vegas that they have to eat here!  Top notch!"

I am blown away by our experience!\n\nOur waiter was very attentive, and gave us his recommendations because it was our first time. We started with cocktails, and they were very good (The Drifter, Southside, and Red Lion). The complimentary bread with the finishing salt/butter that they bring out was very good too; not just your typical bread basket. We were asking our waiter about the different ones we tried, and he got the hint we liked it so he brought us more without asking (great service!).\n\nWe then ordered two appetizers. We got the Smoked Beef Tartare, and Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. Oh my goodness. I cannot rave about these things enough. The Smoked Beef Tartare may be one of my favorite things I have EVER had. The Foie Gras itself was very good with the pickled ramps and sauce, though we did not much care for the goat cheese pop overs. We ordered Bone-In Rib-Eye, and were going to split it because we had so many appetizers. Without even asking, our waiter offered to split it for us, and even asked if he'd prefer they slice it up or just cut it in half. The steak was TO. DIE. FOR. It was the best steak I have ever ordered at a restaurant.\n\nI would and will highly recommend Gordon Ramsay Steak to anyone traveling to Vegas!"

The beef was incredibly juicy, tender, and it melted in my mouth. I have had tender beef, but this texture was on a different level. I wasn't a fan of the pastry though, and so, I was slightly disappointed that I did not order steak. Also, the beef wellington needed a tad more of the brown sauce, but the potato puree was delish.\n\nSticky toffee pudding is a MUST ORDER. It was AMAZING. Served with warm caramel, and vanilla ice cream butter, it was the best dessert we have eaten. The pudding was also larger than my fist, so even though we split it, we only managed to make a small dent to the pudding.\n\nNOTE for beef wellington\nOne order is $56, and if you order it \"for 2\", then it is $51 each. What they don't tell you is that you have to specifically point at the menu and say we are ordering the beef wellington \"for 2\". We ordered 2 beef wellington, which apparently was \"totally different\".\n- an order of beef wellington = 6 oz beef wellington cut into two 3 oz pieces\n- an order \"for 2\" = 6 oz beef wellington cut from an original 12 oz piece\n\nEither way, you get 6oz of beef, so contrary to what the manager thinks, I do not think it is \"totally different\". Luckily, the food is delicious and for $51 or $56 I would still have ordered it."

Of course I had heard of it my whole life but I am very wary of ordering steak dishes because I am usually disappointed, always thinking I could have done better myself at home. Being a big fan of The F Word and Kitchen Nightmares and a viewer of, if not as big a fan of, Hell's Kitchen I have been drooling over his beef wellington for years now so when I finally made it to one of his properties I HAD to make his beef wellington my first beef wellington. \n\nMaybe there was just too much build up. Maybe I just set my hopes too high. Or maybe I am right and there is only so much you can do to a steak no matter how good the cut is. I don;t know. All I know is that it was not all I had hoped it would be.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was very good and perfectly cooked and while I have no other wellington experiences to compare it to, it probably is the best beef wellington on the planet but it just wasn't this mind blowing food experience that I thought it was going to be. Kind of like when you were a kid (before they had fine print) and you were so disappointed that your GI Joe glider really didn't glide as well or that your slinky wasn't really as much fun as those kids on TV made you believe it was. I mean it's meat wrapped in pastry, I don't know exactly what I was expecting but that is what I got.\n\nThat being said, the demi-glace that was draped over the mashed potatoes like some sort of dark silken veil was the mind blowing food experience that I thought the wellington was going to be. I was hoping the bartender would pour me a glass of it but I guess they just don't do that for some reason. It was truly amazing and there was not enough of it on the plate and there may not be enough of it on the planet to curb my appetite for it. I want MORE. NOW! I have had demi-glace dreams since that night and have had to buy new boxers more than a few a times since returning from Vegas. \n\nI also had the pork belly app which was delicious as well. Not the best I have had in Vegas but very very good.\n\nThe restaurant was really not what what I was expecting though. The music was just this side of being uncomfortably loud. The service was good. Not great but good. It was just me and another guy at the bar and while I didn't sit long with an empty glass in front of me it was probably longer than it should have been with only one other customer. I asked my bartender to make me a cocktail that would compliment the wellington and while it was a good cocktail I couldn't really find a common thread with the dish. I think she maybe she was just trained to push that particular cocktail which was on the menu. Usually when I give a bartender free range over my cocktail they showcase a drink they have designed themselves so creatively it was kind of a let down for me. \n\nI plan on going back in March to give it another shot. Hopefully by then you will be able to order demi-glace by the bowl."

Wtf why not tell me this? I wanted 2 lobster tails at $38 each but he told me of the \"Chefs special of seafood trio 1 tail, 2 crab legs & 2 scallops\" didn't mention that it was $95! And it was terrible. We ordered 2 beef wellingtons, and the were a disappointment big time. Pastry was soggy and slid off meat. The bill $265 plus the not deserved tip. Ramsay should do some soul searching. If he went into a restaurant and got this crap without pricing he would flip. These \"Celebrity Chefs\" are becoming a joke.

Hold On, I have my reasons, check it out. \n\nFirst, for my 100th review, I wanted to make it special, this visit was a few months ago.  We booked a table of four a week in advance.  We arrived at the location a bit early and checked in, thinking we might have a chance at getting in early, no dice, the hostess suggests a Drink, waving her hand and pointing towards the casino floor, so off we went to gamble a bit and have a cocktail.  We returned, to the same hostess, with cocktails in hand only to be told that we needed to \"finish those first\" before being seated (referring to our casino drink that she suggested we buy), small hiccup but sets the tone.  So then she proceeds to give us a VERY canned presentation on the restaurant, you can tell she has said the same bit about being transported from Paris to London via the Tunnel about a thousand times.  The crew at Disney says the same lines day after day but you would never catch one of them offering the lackluster performance that we witnessed.\n\nSo, great booth overlooking the restaurant, seated, and away we go.  We decided before that we would all order a little differently so that we could sample as wide a variety as possible.  So here is what we found;\n\nIt was busy, we found that our server seemed a little rushed, he also spoke very softly, which in a fairly busy dinner service creates a little frustration. \n\nTwo prices, face it, this is just stupid, showing me that someone with a \"card\" saves a dollar\" is like telling me that most people who gamble in Vegas lose, worthless info. \n\nDinners, the meat if you will.  They can cook a steak, I'm a mid-western boy, raised on well cooked beef and damn if this steak wasn't melt in your mouth good (both the NY Strip and Rib-eye).  Top 3 steaks I've ever had, EVER.\n\nWellington, Um disappointing.  It was fine really, cooked well but I found the dough to be a little soft and underdone that was on the meat side.  I guess we just expected more.  It was flavorful and well cooked..\n\nAhi, Serious disappointment.  Had large amounts of connective tissue. It lay picked over and un-eaten. We were asked if it was okay, and we offered a shrug and said that we have had better.  They cleared the plate, offered a replacement and it was taken off the bill without asking, nicely played if you ask me.\n\nApps;\n\nGarden Salad. average, even the cheese was just middle of the road\n\nGnocchi, decent.  Nice, better than most, but not the best.\n\nBrussel Sprouts, severe disappointment, drastically under-cooked, sent them back only to find them under-seasoned.  There are too few people who like this veg, when you serve them like this, its no wonder they lose fans, its a wonder the Brussel sprout council hasn't started picketing outside your doors!\n\nOverall, with all the mis-ques,I doubt we will return, there are far too many better choices in Vegas."

Food was satisfactory, some items were much better than others; service wasn't quite on par with restaurant price point or reputation.\n\nBREAD PLATE: Best start to a meal, ever. Three different varieties (lemon herb focaccia, a cinnamon roll-looking thing with prosciutto, and a crispy baguette-slice that tasted like straight-up cheese). All served with the best butter I've ever had, with black sea salt. Breads in order of deliciousness.\n\nFRENCH ONION SOUP: Skippable. Bouchon's is way better. This one has virtually no cheese but is quite rich, consistency more similar to a gravy than a soup. Very scant amount of onions in the bottom, mostly broth in our two orders.\n\nAMERICAN KOBE BEEF SLIDERS: Hyped for a reason, they're delicious. Cheese taste could be more pronounced but quality of meat was the star of this dish. Motivating me to hit up BurGR sooner than I'd planned.\n\nBONE IN RIB EYE: Large portion, great flavor, ordered medium due to table preferences but would have been much better medium-rare. Great crust, plated with a sauce that added just a bit of extra something to it.\n\nBEEF WELLINGTON: Had to try this at least once, underwhelmed. The pate didn't really complement the beef, quality of meat seemed lower in this dish than in others but glad I tried it. Least favorite dish of the night, actually.\n\nBEEF SHORTRIBS: Star of the night! Meaty, falling apart, packed a punch of flavor, plated with an amazing gravy sauce with mushrooms and spinach. Would definitely get this again, highly recommend.\n\nLOADED BAKED POTATO SIDE: Roughly the size of a football, too salty for me to really enjoy but the gouda was delicious and BF's dad really enjoyed it.\n\nMAC AND CHEESE: Shut the front door. This is my new favorite mac dish. I ate almost the entire dish, and I'll take the over on it being worth 5K calories. Worth it, see you at the gym! Didn't expect the peas in this dish but surprisingly didn't mind them.\n\nSTICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Another obligatory purchase, but this one was totally wroth it. I'm not a dessert person but this was downright decadent, delicious cake with toffee sauce and a fabulously light but flavorful ice cream. Bonus points for plating it with a candle for my special day.\n\nDRINKS: Interactive drink menu is on an iPad, underwhelmed by the cocktails but the Justin Paso Robles wine will go with absolutely any of the beef dishes here. If you're in more of a beer mood, the Oskar Blues Old Chub \"Knightro\" is flipping amazing.\n\nSERVICE: As I said, the service wasn't quite on par with the price point or reputation of the restaurant. Two drink orders were missed, and despite having an assistant helping out our server it seemed as if we were largely ignored for portions of the evening. Water levels, wait times, and such were not paid as much attention as expected.\n\nSEATING & DECOR: Highly recommend getting a booth seat next to the kitchen to be able to see the prep station, added extra level of entertainment. Cool bar set in a tube, red lighting fixture based on the arm motions to create GR's famous dessert, small touches that made this place stand apart. Side note, there are easily eight hostesses in black mesh club wear? Awkward costumes, entirely too many bodies in the front of the restaurant."

            "review": "Be sure to get reservations.  This place is incredible.  I finally was able to cross this off the bookmark.  I had been wanting to eat at Ramsay's steakhouse for the longest now.  My last few trips to Vegas I wasn't able to experience that so I knew this would finally be the perfect opportunity.  Great company and great steak is all I could ask for.  The whole experience is marvelous and I'm really impressed and amazed with Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse for sure.\n\nWe arrived on time and was greeted and seated by a lovely host.  The restaurant is simple magnificent.  Located in Paris Las Vegas Hotel, this place had a wonderful view and even better tasting food.  We glanced at the menu before picking up two blueberries something I can't remember the name but they were delicious.  I didn't drink much in Vegas (much to people's surprise) but I definitely had my fair share that evening.  \n\nWe both ordered the American Rib Cap cooked medium rare for me and the other medium well.  My goodness, the steak was oozing with juices and deliciousness.  My mouth became even more watery after the first bite.  The texture was outstanding and the flavor was incredibly mouth watering.  This was definitely a highlight of the whole trip.  I was left so satisfied.  To be honest, I was so full but still wanted another bite.  Thats how amazing it was.  I guess this was finally my Hell's Kitchen experience.  To be fair, it was more heaven than hell.  \n\nOverall the service was amazing.  They did a great job, from chef to waiter to host the place provided excellent service for us.  The steaks were so awesomely well prepared I could not have asked for a better experience.  Seriously give this place a try.  Yes its a bit on the pricier side but its Vegas.  Why waste money on the slots when you can enjoy a great culinary experience."

Maybe it was the overly chic interior--too red and shiny--that I found distracting.  Mind you, my benchmark for Vegas steakhouses in Charlie Palmer's at the Four Seasons.  All that said, the highly recommended Beef Wellington was outstanding, all it was cracked up to be.  There is about a 45 minute wait, as each is made to order and it takes time to bake the puff pastry exterior.  Bide your time with the British ale onion soup or the Kurobuta pork belly starter.\n\nThere's tons of strong competition in the Vegas steakhouse market.  Unfortunately, Gordon Ramsey's comes up a little short in my opinion."

The service, on the other hand, the service was, well, pretentious.  I understand that it's cuisine at it's finest, but how many people in the restaurant know what they're even looking at?  Our waiter was snooty and condescending.  Fortunately the food made up for it.\n\nI would not recommend the $30/ounce fillet.  Although buttery and melt-in-your-mouth exquisite, not worth $90 for the tiniest steak on the planet."

            "review": "The perfect place for my first review. I've long been a fan of Gordon Ramsey and went on a mission when I came to Vegas to try one of his restaurants. The bread they gave us was a delicious start to the meal. We decided that was the only appetizer we needed for the meal. Now onto the main reason to come here. Everybody knows that Gordon Ramsey's famous dish is the beef Wellington and there aren't a whole lot of place that serve it. That was an obvious choice for one entree. We also decide to try the New York since this was supposed to be a steak place. Let me tell you how big a mistake that was. Avoid the steaks and instead get another beef Wellington. While the steak was cooked perfectly cooked medium rare, it was rather plain and did not have any wow factor to it. The beef Wellington on the other hand was absolutely delicious and was everything I expected it to be and more. For our sides we tried the Mac and cheese along with the fingerling potatoes. For my money the Mac and cheese was not worth, I'd rather save 12 dollars and get Kraft. On the other hand The fingerling potatoes were amazing and went perfectly with the two entrees. For desert our waiter suggested the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla butter ice cream. Let me preface this by saying that I'm normally not a big fan of sweets, but this was absolutely the perfect way to end the meal. While the sticky toffee was incredibly sweet, the ice cream was the perfect companion and together the taste was just delightful. \nIf I were to rate just the beef Wellington and the sticky toffee pudding, this place would get five stars. But mostly because I was disappointed in the steak I have to knock it down one."

            "review": "I went to Gordon Ramsay Steak a few weeks ago and was lucky enough to get a table for 4 with no reservation just as they opened on a Saturday. We did not pick this restaurant for any special occasion but we were staying in the Paris Casino and wanted to see if Chef Gordon's food would match up to his reputation. Upon entering the restaurant the hostess proceeded to explain the purpose of the designs of the place in great detail. The Decor was very simple yet effective in giving that \"wow\" factor. Everything from the tables to the floors were spotless and welcoming. I particularly got a kick out of the giant British flag on the ceiling.\n\nRight as we were sat at our table, our water was poured and we were served bread, our napkins were spread across our laps (and it wasn't even weird). Our server, Oliver, was introduced to us and he greeted us with an apology because we had to wait 5 minutes before speaking to him (no big deal at all). He presented us with a drink menu and got to know each of us. Now, I hesitate to call Oliver a server because this was probably the best service I have ever received in a restaurant in my life time. Oliver is more of an artist in his field. You take the pinnacle of being a gentleman, the skill of being worthy of working for a world class Chef, and top tier customer service and you have Oliver. Literally every single recommendation he had from Gin to cuts of meat were spectacular! I ordered the American Rib Cap (medium rare) Oscar Style. Talk about tender and flavorful. Then the King Crab legs over my steak with the buttery sauce all over a bed of Asparagus was something to write home about. We also ordered the Deep Fried Oysters which were great (DO NOT EAT THE AROMATIC SALTS, my buddy and I did by accident and we regretted it). \n\nWe were so pleased with the service not only from Oliver but also the rest of the staff that we came back the following day for the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was also recommended to us by Oliver and once again he was right. The presentation of the warm dessert and the rectangular chilled block of vanilla ice cream paired perfectly with the hot toffee sauce over it, and all while being complemented with an amazing cup of espresso with chocolate spoons filled with alcohol to wash it down.\n\nOverall as stated above our experience was perfect. We will be returning to this restaurant in a few weeks when we visit Las Vegas again. Thank you Chef Ramsay, the staff, and Oliver for an amazing time."

            "review": "Beginning with the food; everything sampled on the menu from bread through dessert was simply sublime. Dinner was a culinary tour of delights with each dish bringing multiple layers of distinctive flavors. I'm not going to walk you through our dinner menu other than to note that every appetizer, entree, and dessert at our table was something to rave about.\n\nRamsay's team has lavished care and extraordinary attention to every small detail of the dining experience from staging to presentation to staff attire and service protocol. This is the gold standard for a memorable dining experience.\n\nThe spoiler for me was the loud foreground music and I'm referring to detainee-torture loud. I understand Ramsay is looking to be smart, high energy, edgy and in your face and that they want to turn tables quickly. Research shows that people eat and drink more and faster to high tempo loud music and that when people are surrounded by sound, their brain chemistry changes and other senses are measurably enhanced. Food tastes better and you're prone to over-indulge. Anyway; if you relish a bout of ringing ears, and are adverse to conversation at the table, Ramsay's can make that happen for you.\n\nRamsay's might provide an elegant and tasty solution If you have a date that's attractive but afflicted with an unfortunate voice.\n\nYes, you will be drawn and quartered when the check arrives, but understand that 'nice costs' and its not something you'll be doing every day. You can save some of the damage by specifying tap water.  When they inquire if you'd prefer still or sparkling water, they don't mention it's ten bucks for a small bottle and they're anxious to proactively keep cracking new bottles for you.\n\nRamsay's provides an extraordinary and memorable dining experience, compromised (for me) by the offensively loud music.I dinged Ramsay's one star for the adversarial sound environment. I can understand losing my voice at a rock concert, but not over dinner."

            "review": "(More of a 2.5 meh, but leaning left due to the hype)\n\nDid I eat at the same place as the rest of these reviews?  Four star average out of 1650+ reviews (not counting the 400+ hidden reviews, admittedly some of which are probably fake, with their single review)?  Maybe for the \"experience\" and cachet of the Gordon Ramsay name, but as far as for the steaks themselves?  No friggin way.  \n\nEtc:  Ambiance/decor/staff were nice and trendy-cool.  The acoustics/music level were a bit loud, but I get it - they're going for a livelier upbeat atmosphere instead of the usual stoic old fashioned traditional steak houses.  Does make conversations at tables bigger than a 4-top a tad difficult though.  Not dinging anything off for that.\n\nApps/sides:  Decent/good, nothing mind-blowing/wow.  Marrow was sizeable at two bone halves per order.  Truffle fries (not on the menu) were good.  Shishito peppers had an odd taste to them - not \"these taste bad\" odd, but \"something here tastes...different\" odd.  Shiitake mushrooms with ginger was interesting, and helped the steaks (more on that in a bit).  Other apps/sides we had weren't particularly noteworthy.\n\nSteaks:  This is supposed to be a steak place, right?  It says so in the name.  Not a  restaurant that serves a variety of dishes that happens to include a few steaks, but a place that serves steaks as their primary specialty.  Point is, their steaks should be well above average.  They're not.  Their standard non-wagyu steaks are supposedly hand-selected and dry aged 28+ days.  For those of you who don't know, that means the steaks should be more flavorful and tender than non-aged meat, because [science].  My bone-in NY strip (which already should be one of the beefier tasting cuts) was quite bland, lacking in flavor, a bit on the chewy side, and definitely missing any of that complex flavor from a nice aging.  (Now that I think about it after the fact, I'd guess it wasn't dry aged at all).  I tried my friend's royal long bone chop (or as everyone else calls it, a tomahawk steak), and while a bit more tender than my NY, it too was rather bland.  Others in my party (with various cuts)  had similar thoughts on their steaks as well - bland and lacking in flavor.  If you got it topped with a sauce or something like foie or maybe some umami-boosting mushroom, it definitely helped.  But a good proper steak should be able to stand on its own with minimal help (like a bit of salt & pepper).  On top of that, there wasn't the nice charred crust you get at many steak houses (though okay - that part may be personal preference, so I'm not subtracting anything there).  Don't get me wrong - these weren't bad steaks, but they weren't great either, especially for the price.  It's quite obvious that a decent chunk of the prices here are due to the Ramsay name and fame.  \n\nGoing back to this being billed as a steakhouse, it seemed a bit odd that the menu listed a number of \"Signature\" non-steak dishes.   Normally, it's good to order from the house specialties/signatures, but then again so is ordering steak at a steakhouse.  Having those two groups exclusive of each other is a bit of a head scratcher.  If the Signature dishes are supposed to be their strong point, I would've ordered from that section instead, and a name like Gordon Ramsay Vegas would be more appropriate.  \n\nI guess it might be worth noting I don't normally watch any of Ramsay's television shows, aside from the first two seasons of Hell's Kitchen, the occasional Kitchen Nightmares when nothing else is on, and a handful of his UK shows (where he isn't constantly yelling at people like his US/Fox persona).  So being a Gordon Ramsay establishment doesn't add anything to my opinion of the place, but it does make me hold the bar higher than a non-celebrity-chef restaurant.  If it weren't for the name, the extra cost that name adds, and all the \"OMG this steak was sooooo good\" reviews of obvious television fans, it'd be an average 3-star rating."

The bread came in different flavors but nothing amazing. When our order arrived it was delivered by a server for each person that repeats what you ordered.  I didn't care for it much because it was like trying to listen to two conversations at once. I also thought it would have been nice if I had been told my plate was hot since I found out when I tried to pull it closer to me.  We started with the Ricotta Raviolo, it was good but the pasta on the Raviolo was a bit thick and a little tough.  I had the Market green salad which was good but I would have preferred fresh tomatoes.  My husband had the top cap which he really enjoyed with a side of figerling potatoes that were good. He also ordered the bone marrow, an acquired taste I am not interested in acquiring.  I had the signature short rib with the potato puree, swiss chard, and wild mushrooms.  The short rib was ok. The meat was chewy so I picked at it and ate it in very small portions avoid having to keep chewing.  The mushrooms in my opinion were tough and the swiss chard had no flavor.  The potato puree was good but there wasn't much of it and the wine sauce got a little thick as it cooled... maybe that's normal.  I guess I was kind of relieved when one of the many staff members asked if I was done and even though I wasn't  I said yes.  The star of the evening was the toffee pudding.  If you go to this restaurant for nothing else go for the toffee pudding.  It really is amazing.  Would I go back?  I think I would give them another shot.  Maybe I should have ordered a steak... I mean it is a steak house but I love short rib and always order it when it's on any menu plus it was a signature dish!  I think the sign of a great steak restaurant isn't how well they do their steak but how much effort they put into everything else they serve.  I do wonder if anything would have been different if Gordon himself were behind the counter but.. I guess i will never know."

            "review": "We dined here on the first night of our vegas trip.  The food and service were great.  I had the foie gras, rib eye steak and the sticky toffee pudding.  The foie gras was the best I've ever had.  A nice thick slice with a nice sear.  The steak was very good as well, cooked perfectly medium rare.  It needed a little more salt for such a thick piece of meat.  The sticky toffee pudding was the perfect ending to the meal.  I now know why it was voted best dessert in vegas.  Initially I though it was going to be overly sweet but it was perfect and the brown butter ice cream is out of this world. \n5 stars for this dining experience\ndefinitely worth coming here for the foie gras and sticky toffee pudding\n\nOn the last day of our trip we couldn't decide where to eat and decided to go back hoping to find a seat at the bar since reservations were full.  The hostess told us to seat ourselves and someone would help us.  We found a table by the bar, sat and waited and waited and waited.  10-15 minutes later a waitress handed us menus.  We waited, waited and waited some more and she finally came back to take our order.  She had someone follow and listen to her (probably a new hire training).  I don't know if that was why everything took so long.  We ordered the seafood platter, foie gras and sticky toffee pudding.\nThe seafood platter had potential to be great.  One of the cocktail shrimp had a nice sized vein still on.  This is not what I expect from a gordon ramsey establishment.  I showed our waitress and she took it back to the kitchen.  The kitchen staff replaced the shrimp with a shrimp that looked like it had been sauteed and then drenched in butter, not what was returned to the kitchen.  The mussels still had the beard attached.  I didn't bother saying anything.  The foie gras was perfect like the first time I ordered it.  The sticky toffee pudding was delicious as well but looked like it was sitting for a while because the ice cream was already melting.\n\n1 star for this dining experience\n\nWill I return? probably but would not go here without a reservation"

He has a great personality and made our dinner an experience and not just about the food. \n\nThe food was amazing, I had the filet and my girlfriend had the wellington. The food is simply unreal. I have nothing to say about the food other then you will love it. \n\nThe manager on duty was also very nice coming by our table to ensure everything was going good. \n\nI suggest you try the drifter cocktail, it was sooooo good. \n\n\nWe did try all 3 of his restaurants during our stay in vegas and this was the best. \n\n#1 Ramsay Steak \n#2 Ramsay Burger \n#3 Ramsay Brew Pub - not our favorite but was still good. \n\nWe will be back next year and will personally request sitting in the same section as Yaron. \n\nThanks for a good time."

Anywayyyy to start I love Gordon Ramsay I've gone to probably like 4 different places of his from the west coast to the north (where I live) and each one multiple times. Never disappointed. So before I say this next thing half of you will get it the other half will think I'm crazy or nuts. I don't eat meat. Believe it or not plays a big factor at a steakhouse. And yes my parents did take me to a steakhouse for my birthday even though I don't eat meat. I just stopped eating meat a few months ago for various reasons I won't get into. Anyway, before this resturant we went to Gallagher's (another steakhouse) the waitress there rushed and got a vegetarian menu for me she was very nice. At Steak the waitress went and asked for me and was incredibly nice about it most waiters have given me nasty looks or weird ones like there is something wrong with me. But everyone at Ramsay worked amazingly well with me telling me everything that I could have and not worry about any meat. I loved it! Hopefully more and more vegetarians will start visiting steakhouses and they will soon realize they all need to make veggie menus for us non meat eaters! (A girl can dream). Overall I would obviously go back again it was wonderful especially dessert."

Salads and sides were VERY small compared to other restaurants - especially given the cost.  I'm a huge chocolate fan but couldn't finish the very small portion of cake provided due to the lack of flavor or any sense of gratification - its hard to ruin chocolate but they somehow managed to do so.\n\nWAY over priced!!!  Three drinks (tea, coke, cocktail), two very small ceasars, two very small sides, two filets, one lobster tail, two desserts - about $350.  Also two different prices and we were up-charged for lack of some rewards program - really??  Is the food here about the food or some frequent flyer program?  All I wanted was a great meal.  Not to feel like I was getting reamed further for lack of  casino rewards participation.  Let the food stand for itself and not some marketing scheme.\n\nFor all the talk and presentation about the meat here, it was the worst I've ever had on the strip.   I felt I was definitely paying for the \"celebrity\" and not the \"chef\" in this case.\n\nBeso and Delmonico were SIGNIFICANTLY better.\n\nOne star for the toffee bread pudding."

So hubby and I scoped it out longingly for 2 days. We looked at the menu, asked to see the wine list (had to go inside and ask for it, they keep on an iPad it's so extensive). Walked in, walked out. Finally, we asked about the bar and were told it's first come, first serve and they offer the whole menu.  They invited us to go in and look in the bar. I turns out, we had no reason to be so intimidated. People were in there sharing a burger and fries, just like any other restaurant. We are huge Hell's Kitchen fans and really wanted to try some of Ramsay's signature dishes like fois gras and beef Wellington.  So that's what we did. Fois gras ($26) was heavenly. I've eaten a lot of different preparations of it, and this one was the best I've ever had. Served with some type of jam and a pistachio pesto thing. Really paired well with the $10 beer I had (innes and Gunn) which is aged in bourbon barrels. We also had the kobe beef sliders and split the Wellington for one and it was a huge serving! We couldn't pass up the sticky toffee pudding dessert. It ended up being a huge meal and our total bill was $155 plus tip. Totally worth it for what we got. The food and experience were memorable. Just do it."

I did enjoy his Gordon Ramsay BurGR spot & knew I couldn't be disappointed with his steakhouse. We came on a Sunday evening with a reservation at 5:30 PM. We were seated upstairs in a very comfortable round booth that gave us a nice view to the restaurant downstairs.  Majority of the yelp reviews said it all so I'll try to get mine to the point! IMO - GR Steakhouse did not disappoint & quite frankly I would definitely come back again.\n\n-:::- VENUE / DECOR / AMBIANCE -:::-\n\nLocated right inside the Paris hotel, a great location to dine at since it's in the middle of the LV strip. GS Steakhouse is contemporary with a very London ambiance, and kinda of noisy too (downstairs more so than upstairs). Within there is a bar, a lounge, two-story dining area, private dining rooms & an open kitchen. Loved the ambiance & we all had a great dining experience.\n\n-:::- SERVICE  -:::-\n\nThe ambiance is very classy but what I appreciated about the whole experience is that the staff was not snobbish nor uptight. Everyone from the hostess to the busboys was friendly, efficient & delightful to engage with. But I took a 1/2 star off cuz our server forgot we were here to celebrate my birthday :(  We saw other tables around us getting served a birthday dessert :P But she was super cool & packed us a round of the comp breads to go :)\n\n-:::- FOOD / VARIETY -:::- \n\nWe passed the option of the tasting menu & went with our own picks. Prices were fair & very well worth it!\n\nComp Bread Platter           [4.5/5.0]\n - Gotta go for the truffle & bacon rolls (looks like mini cinnamon rolls)\n - We even ordered 2nd rounds of bread too :)\nShrimp Cocktail                 [4.5/5.0]\n - The best cocktail sauce!\nBeef Wellington                 [4.0/5.0]\n - FYI: eat/try this before the flavorful rich tasting steaks.\nAmerican Rib Cap 8oz      [5.0/5.0]\n - Scrumptious & melts in your mouth! MUST MUST MUST GET!!\nAmerican Kobe Skirt 8oz   [4.5/5.0]\nPan Seared Foie Gras      [5.0/5.0]\n - Omg heavenly! Love it! \nSide of Asparagus             [4.5/5.0]\nSticky Toffee Pudding        [5.0/5.0]\n - The BEST dessert & not overly sweet!

STRANGE! Then we were lead to the worst table in the house, next to the elevator from one floor to the other, and with a view to the bussing station sink. Uh, NO! I think not at these prices! So, we asked to be reseated. 10 minutes later, the same hostess comes over to the bad table and leads us to an equally bad table, and says, \"this table is available, or you can wait another 15-20 minutes for something better\". Uh, NO! So, we left and had a wonderful diner, with a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip at the restaurant at the top of the Eifel Tower.

Get yourself a new menu provider.  What a waste!\n\nWe had the Beef Wellington, which was a perfectly cook Filet.  However, the crust soon fell apart, although light and flaky in the beginning.\n\nI've found that the more expensive the restaurant, the higher the expectations, the less chance you have of feeling you got your money's worth.  Of course, I haven't eaten at every restaurant in Vegas, but for the 6 or 7 high-end places I've been, I have always been disappointed.  I've had better luck in SF, LA, NYC, Florence, Paris, Rome, and believe it or not, Richmond, Virginia."

So we decided to go back for the beef wellington.\nthe service was just OK, the waiter just used the poliitically correct words: \"Happy to have you here\", explain the menu, any questions, Hope you enjoy.... all the right words, but it was clear he didn't mean a word. FAKE IT! that's part of the job description. I just spent $300 for 2 person, Show me you care about my feelings.\nNow to the food.\nThe appetizers were the best part. My wife has the Baby Beet Salad and I had the Gnocchi and we both enjoyed it. our main courses were just OK, both signature dishes.\nMy wife had the Fisherman's Grill (maine lobster, mussels, scallop, seasonal fish,vadouvan curry a\u00efoli) and I had the beef wellington. the beef was of great quality, however the dish was saggy, it seems it was sitting for a little while under a heating lamp. we had as a side dish Fingerling Potatoes with parmesan, truffle, too much truffle, you were not able to taste anything else.\nAll this in combination with the correct, but not welcoming service was enough for me to only give 2 stars.\nI was disappointed as the evening before we were at the Country Club at the Wynn and had a great service and good food , the service made all the difference.\nI would not go back to Gordon Ramsays Steak.\n\n\nI received a very professional email from a manager from the restaurant which positively surprised me. So my concerns are taken seriously. They invited me back to have another dining experience, something a very much appreciate. That alone is wroth an upgrade by 1 star, so now I give them 3. It shows to me that they care! So I will give it a chance and go there next time I am in Vegas. and I will hope the food and service are as good as I want them to be :)"

            "review": "Basically this place is a pain in the a$$ to reserve. The number on the website brings you to some automatic answering machine from Caesars group. So i was confused because the restaurant was supposed to be in Paris Las Vegas. Finally after numerous trial and error i get to speak to a real human. I asked for the dress code and they told me it was business casual, no jeans, no shorts, t shirts and open toe footwear. \n\nI only had a pair of jeans because who the hell wear pants in the 110 degrees summer in Las Vegas? So i decided not to place my reservation and try my luck walking in for a spot anyway. I was dining alone so i thought it should be fine. \n\nSo upon reaching the restaurant, they told me the place was fully booked for the night and since i was only a party of 1,i can go ahead and take a seat at the bar for my dinner. (nobody said anything about my jeans) \n\nSo i sat down and i decided to go for the Beef Wellington, because what else do u wanna eat at a steakhouse by GR? After all the episodes on hell kitchen, you know that they can't f*** the beef Wellington up. But on the menu, it states to allow a 45 minutes prep time for it. Being famished, i decided to order the wagyu sliders for starters. \n\nSo i sat and waited. They served me bread. It was fantastic, the fancy black salt on the butter was simply out of this world. The truffle pastry was amazingly soft and tasty. The lemon cake thingy was good too. My sliders came, was tasty, but didn't blow my mind away. Similar to the American burger i had in GR burgr,rather have a burger at his burgr joint.\n\nAnd then i went to the washroom, clean and comfortable, they even had paper towels printed with GR steak on it. Outstanding. But i was here for the food. \n\nI went back to the bar and saw a slightly confused waiter holding my beef Wellington . It looked exactly like how i first googled what a beef Wellington was. Scored the first point in presentation. I took a cut, knife slices through cleanly, second point scored. Put it in my mouth. Wow, that tenderness of the fillet mignon , the flavor of the cured ham, the baked mushroom pastry combined with the hint of mustard. Third point scored. And then that was it. It went downhill from there onwards. \nAfter a few slices, the pastry decided that it wants to separate from the beef, the mushroom paste fell apart, the ham went all over the place and it became a very hard dish to eat. Because this was a dish you are supposed to eat everything together, the star of the dish, the filet mignon, suddenly didn't taste so great afterall. After a few mouths, i decided that the texture of the beef was \"mushy\", instead of tender. Perhaps the chef dropped the filet mignon into the water bath for far too long a time? With every chew, the beef came apart till the point it just felt like i was eating baby food. \n\nAfter an agonising 15 minutes, i cleaned up whatever that was left on my plate. Asked for the check and left. I stood up and turned around, guess what i saw? An old man sitting one of the tables, he was wearing a polo tee, track shoes and a pair of bermuda shorts. So much so for the \"dressy dress code\". A big -.- _|_ to whoever who told me the dresscode was."

Dined here in August 2013, and this place lived up to the hype. \n\nFirst off, as other reviewers have mentioned, the waiter will ask if you'd like still or sparkling water. Caution - they charge $9 a bottle for these choices. If you want good 'ol tap water (free!), just ask for ice water. \n\nFood was amazing. We had the gnocchi appetizer to start. Very delicious, but not your typical gnocchi in sauce. As the waiter described it, it was more of a \"deconstructed\" interpretation of gnocchi. \n\nFor our entrees, the bf and I both chose the beef Wellington. AMAZING. I have had quality steak at my share of fine dining restaurants, and the Wellington here blew them all out of the water. For sides, we ordered the mac and cheese (deelish!), as well as the baked potato. Both awesome. \n\nLast but not least, we had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. EPIC. The pudding was delicious, and the brown butter ice cream, which was rich and decadent, was the perfect accompaniment. \n\nThis meal, plus a few drinks, set us back around $200, not including tip. We also used our total rewards card which helped to save a few dollars. \n\nIf you're in Vegas, I HIGHLY recommend you check this place out. You will not be disappointed!!"

It doesn't matter how long I'm in town for or what the occasion is, I will always get my Gordon Ramsay Steak.  \n\nI've tried most of the best steaks LA and Vegas has to offer and nothing comes close to the American Wagyu rib cap that this place offers.  Every time I recommend this place to someone I always give the a disclaimer: you will never enjoy a steak from any other place ever again.  No one has disagreed with me so far.  \n\nAdmittedly, the bread and the sides are, at best, average.  However, the high quality and flavor of the steak that is prepared to perfection every time just blows away any dish I've ever eaten - and that is the real highlight of this place.  Considering how expensive it is to purchase rib cap in the store, if you can find it, $70 for a succulent 8 oz. cut is well worth the money.  To top off the meal, I would highly recommend the sticky toffee pudding to round out your meal.  Order these two items and you can die knowing you've had the best meal on Earth."

So it was obvious that when I was in Vegas for my sister's wedding, I had to go here. \n\nI made reservations online about 2 months in advance for myself, boyfriend, and another couple who shares the love for Ramsey also! That was quick and easy! \n\nWe arrived at 7 and we're brought right to our table. The hosts were super friendly and ours told us a little about the restaurant and decor. \n\nOur waiter arrived and he was amazing! Seriously top notch service, which should be at a place like this, but I had never had this type of experience. He was so funny and knowledgeable and gave us the perfect amount of time to decide what we want. He also brought over the cool meat tray so we could see the meats they have to offer. We ordered the kobe beef sliders, crispy pork belly, and foie gras for appetizers. Everything was delicious as expected. The foie gras was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I was hesitant to try it at first but it is so so flavorful and delicious! If there is one appetizer you try make it this! \n\nFor dinner I ordered the filet, my boyfriend had the beef short rip, and the other couple ordered the seafood mix and porterhouse steak. We ordered fingerling potatoes and truffle Mac for sides. Everyone ate every last bit! Steak was cooked perfectly and was so delicious! \n\nFor dessert we both had the sticky toffee pudding. OMG can I just eat this 24/7? Gooey, chocolate, crunchy, melty, everything you dream of goodness! \n\nI hope I can come back here next time I'm in Vegas, if for nothing else the dessert! Totally worth the price and the experience was great! Overall the dinner took 3 hours, which is sort of crazy, but was well worth it."

Shortly after, we were seated.\n\nFor apps, we got the smoked steak tartare, beet salad, and corn chowder. Each were good - not great - though the chips served with the tartare were addictive. \n\nFor our entrees, we shared the Beef Wellington and the Kobe American rib cap. It was a tough decision, but the meat pushed around on a cart helped us make the choice between the bone in rib eye and the rib cap. The Wellington was hands down my favorite item of the night - the meat was as soft as butter and the crust was the best I've ever had. The rib cap was good, but it fell short of the our waitresses description as the \"best ribeye we will ever have.\" On the side we got mushrooms. They were perfect.\n\nWe skipped dessert because we were too full, but the table next to us said they loved the toffee cake.\n\nExcellent dinner. Spot on service. Total tab: $250,"

This put a big smile on my face and was the cherry on top of the awesome food for me and made for a great night and celebration.\n\nThe food was incredible from start to finish. We shared the Kurabota Pork Belly with cheesy grits, the Gnocchi with blistered heirloom tomatoes, royal trumpet mushrooms, Iberico Jamon and mushroom cream, the Maine Lobster stuffed with chorizo and a brandied cream lobster sauce, the Wagyu Rib Cap, Foie Gras, Mac and Cheese and Fingerling Potatoes and the Bone Marrow.\n\nWhen going to a restaurant we always like to share because we get to sample a bit of everything and were glad we did because the dishes did not disappoint.

However, they have a first-come, first-serve lounge/bar area that will also serve the entire menu.  This actually ended up working out perfectly because we had a show to catch! \n\nThe lounge area is very modern looking.. a waitress immediately greets you and presents you with an ipad which has all the drink details.  The wine list is extensive and actually a little overwhelming... that or I was just too excited to be there to focus...  sensing my indecisiveness, our waitress recommended a red blend, Prisoner.  It was a little shocking at $28 a glass but man, oh man, was it good.  And having overheard that we had a show to catch, our ever helpful waitress -who's name i wish i could remember- suggested we put in our orders ASAP because they were expecting a party of 70! \n\nWe started with a shared caesar salad.  I usually steer clear of the caesar salads because I hate anchovies and have a pretty sensitive palate.. i couldn't taste any at all in this one.  It was just delicious with generous amounts of parmesan cheese and garlic croutons.  There were also some breaded quail eggs in there - i wasn't such a fan of those.  \n\nAlso, the bread basket is freaken amazing, each piece of bread had such a unique taste to it.  I couldn't get enough!\n\nNow the main attraction: \n\nThe Mother Effing Beef Wellington.  Holy crap was that thing good.  To quote a prior review, \"life changing.\"  \n\nGo there.

I never miss any of his shows and have been waiting to try one of his restaurants so when we decided to go to Vegas, eating at Steak was the number one thing we wanted to do. My husband and I ate here this past saturday while visiting LV. We started off with the Gnochi and Beef sliders. I don't like beef because I'm not a fan of the taste, BUT this was my one exception to where I would eat it. The gnocchi was okay, probably wouldnt order it again if I went back. The beef sliders were very delicious! From the presentation (theyre so small, but cute) to the taste. Definitely a must try. Like I said, a HUGE fan of all his shows - so the Beef Wellington was the main reason I wanted to check this place out and i must tell you, it totally surpassed all the hype that the dish has. It was really good! The beef melted in my mouth! Yumm! By this point, we were sooo full, I was about to explode it was so much food! lol From the yelp reviews, going in we knew we had to order the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. The waiter recommended it as well. So, i have to say, it was the PERFECT ending to dinner. It was literally the BEST dessert we ever had. Dinner ended up being pretty pricey: $200 for gnocchi, beef sliders, 2 beef wellingtons, truffle mac n cheese and the sticky toffee pudding, and no drinks from the bar, but to say the least - the whole experience was amazing and food was delicious. Totally worth checking out, and so glad we got the chance to do so! Believe the hype!! :)"

We went in skeptical because we are not into hype and had already tried other \"celebrity chef\" restaurants and come away disappointed.  But Gordon Ramsay has done an excellent job!\n\nThe atmosphere was \"spot on\" and the restaurant staff was friendly, helpful and always kept our water glasses full.  Not once did we feel like we were being \"snobbed\" like at other places, even though we have to admit we were underdressed in casual attire... it didn't have any effect on our service unlike some places.\n\nNow to the most important part.. the food!  We split a caesar salad and had NY strip and a filet mignon.  For the side we had the mac and cheese.  The waiter was honest up front and told us it might take some time to prepare the steaks, so we were glad we got the salad.  The bread basket was yummy and very different.  Mac and cheese was unique and delicious!\n\nSteaks were cooked to perfection!  Tender, juicy and they were the best we've ever had.. and we've been to many steakhouses throughout California and several in Vegas!   Don't know what they put on the meat, but they melted in our mouth!\n\nSo if you get a chance to go to Gordan Ramsay Steak, don't pass it up!

I have eaten at places that cost this much but does not taste nearly as good as this place.\n\nI don't remember if it's a weekday or a weekend we went but we had to wait about an hr for our table. Just to give you a hint."

We were enticed by the Hell's Kitchen tasking menu and the topper was that we were able to keep a copy of the menu in a commemorative holder with an autographed picture of Gordon. Very beautiful. Our server was amazing. Very welcoming and informative. Started with Scotch Egg. We loved it but wished it was bigger. 2nd course was delicious (heirloom tomatoes with Buffalo Mozzarella) despite not being a big fan of salads. 3rd course was Scallop risotto. Exceptional. Risotto was mushroom based and the scallop was like meat. Could have eaten this as a main if bigger. 4th course was the 'main attraction' of Beef Wellington. For me, not the best welly we ever had (and we have tried others including GR in LA & NY) but overall this was fantastic. It came with some lovely veggies and a fabulous potato puree that was HEAVEN. The meat was cooked perfectly for both my wife and me who usually like different temps. And then came what we though was an 'extra' to the meal but became the highlight. The sticky toffee pudding was frickin' AMAZING. it's presented to look like a piece of bread and butter. The pudding was BIG, warm and gooey and the ice cream was like butter...exactly what they intended. Putting them together was a pure high. SO GOOD. If you don't get the tasting menu, you'd be a fool to not try this dessert. I told my wife we would never have this again unless it was here as it spoiled us for future experiences. We also purchased a GR steak placemat (was disappointed that we had to purchase a 'used' one as they were out of stock) but it's beautiful and a real souvenir from an amazing dining  symphony. Overall, we LOVED our experience and we will definitely go back. Thanks Gordon."

Butter poached lobster - amazing. The disappointment for us was the special mushroom truffle risotto (side). Even tho you could see the shaved truffle on top of the risotto there was hardly any flavor. Tasted like a mushroom risotto and that's it (and for $60 totally expected more). Will be back tho, worth it in my opinion."

            "review": "I took a group of 5 to GR Steak for my sisters 40th birthday with a reservation at 8:45pm on a Sunday night. We were taken upstairs to one of the back rooms which i could only describe as a banquet room for large groups. There were two parties already there a party of 8 from a wedding, and a party of 12 on the other side of us. It was so noisy that our server had to yell for us to hear him over the people in the room, and he came off a little loud and programmed because of this.  In advance I had told GRS that we were coming for my sisters birthday, when they called to confirm our reservation they said they would put a candle on a desert we ordered. But when our server made his way to our table it had not been clearly communicated to him as the first thing we were asked was if we were celebrating anything special tonight...um yea?-Awkward!  We should have known how the night was going to go when the server only offered us sparkling or filtered bottled water ($9 per bottle), he didnt bother to tell us that we could have gotten tap water for free, until later in the night when we asked.  We ordered a bottle of champagne with our server and he advised us the sommelier would be bringing it to us shortly.  We waited, and waited and waited.  We watched our server do the meat presentation for the wedding party and then take it to another group of 8, that I would describe as soccer players who came in after us.  I overheard him tell the soccer group that this would be the last meat presentation of the night, only to see another server across the room take it to a table of 10 that were seated after the soccer team. The meat presentation never made it to our table and was NEVER presented to us, only those around us.  It took an hour for us to even get bread, the black salt butter was amazing and even then we sill did not have our champagne. So only bread and water.  The sommelier finally arrived with the Champagne about 15 minutes later.  We had waited so long that we had finished the first bottle and had to ordered another bottle so we could have it with our appetizers. CHEERS!  We ordered 3x 1/2 dozen oysters, a shrimp cocktail, two tomato salads, our entrees of 2 bone in ribeye, a filet, (we added the foie gras also-yummy!),  the seafood platter and the short ribs.  We added sides of corn, carrots, asparagus and truffle mac and cheese, along with a bottle of wine for dinner.  The server described the sides as enough for 1 1/2 people so we ordered several. Honestly the sides were big enough for 3 people. It would end up being wasted food.  We continued to wait, and wait and wait. 20 minutes later we ask our waiter and he stated it takes a long time for them to shuck the (18) oysters..um ok?  When the appetizers finally arrived everything came all at once, salads, oysters, shrimp cocktail. BAM! finally food!  The oysters which maybe they went to go get were not cleaned properly and we all had shells in our mouths from them. We again waited and the dirty appetizer plates and display sat forever on our table as we waited even longer.  The back waiter might have been new because he never seemed to pick up any dirty plates, and our server finally cleared the plates and came back to wipe off our place mat with a rag.  We finally got our entrees around 11pm with the sides that all of the vegetables were cold.  We ate them anyways because no one wanted to continue to wait.  The Bearnaise sauce was also cold and lumpy.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the rest of the night went ok. Once two of the large parties left the room the noise level was acceptable, no more cackling noise piercing our brains. It took us almost 2 1/2 hours start to finish.\n\nThe overall impression that I got was that the server decided to judge us ahead of ordering, and didnt put the energy into worrying about our table.  We spent $1k for the whole group and the service was completely lacking.  Maybe I expected to much from a place with Gordon's name on it. I am a total Gordon Ramsey fan, watch all his shows, and have most of his cook books, but I have had way better service and experiences at steak houses at other places like Chicago and NYC.\n\nI would not recommend this place for a group, maybe they pay better attention to couples.\n\nWe would never dine here again, it was very disappointing and I was embarrassed that my friends and family had such a bad experience."

I didn't like that restriction because the truth is, it's hard to afford $149 as it was and to have everyone on the table order it is tough.  We ended up having to order items from the menu a la carte.  Beef wellington, fish n chips, baked potatoes, side of potatoes, mac n cheese, scallops and beef short ribs.  Our a la carte items ended up costing $340 and we didn't even order any drinks or dessert.  Every food item, however, was delicious as expected. My only real complaint is our server, whose non-stop selling was annoying.  Our water person (lady) was fantastic and very nice."

We were seated right away upon our prompt arrival. The staff was friendly and professional. The food was outstanding. They even brought around a meat cart so you can see the different cuts of meat. Everything was explained...the different types of bread, how long the Wellington would take, except the fact that they charge for the water. (Unless I missed that?) It's bottled and imported, and not free, so just be aware of that $9 charge for a bottle of still (the word \"water\" is not in the description on the receipt.) Oh, and know that a soda is $6. Wow. I knew I was going to pay over $50 for the Wellington, but that's just robbery on the drinks. If you want to save money, make sure to sign up for a free Total Rewards card first. You get a discount. -- prices with and without that card are printed right on the menu. \n\nThis is a good place for special occasions. The music was a little too loud, which we experienced all over Vegas during this trip. So it wasn't especially romantic. But it was really delicious !!"

The service is excellent from the ladies out front, to the waiters and bus boys. The inside is lively and trendy and it just has that fun atmosphere when you can sit for a long time,  drink and hang out.\n\nOf everything we ordered, the beet salad and my beef wellington were the standout items. In fact the beef welly was amazing. Toffee pudding? Amazing. Fingerling potatoes? not amazing. Fried green beans? Not amazing. The french coffee with chocolate spoons? - Very awesome. Lick-the-spoon-clean awesome.\n\nYou even get to see the Hell's Kitchen winner Chef Christina doing her thing.\n\nWhat I don't get is how a restaurant of this quality can't throw together a vegetarian meal on the fly. Yes yes i know, steak house, vegetarian, mind blown, i get it.\n\nIf this was applebees and they told me they can't do sushi? Fine, my expectations are low to begin with. When you're going to a place with a chef that can cook while being called a donkey and a muppet on national television, I expect them to be able to throw together a decent vegetarian dish. The vegetarian risotto that my gf received was basically not great. I tried it. It was left there half eaten. I've been to very few high end restaurants that couldn't do a good alternative for the non meat eaters.\n\nThe meats that came out were amazing. The non meat stuff was just alright."

I'm gonna apologize in advance for the obvious sucking up and butt kissing.\n\nFew of us came in for dinner on a weeknight. Made a res couple months earlier. Got sat promptly at our time at an upstairs table. I liked it up there, not sure why some people don't. Seems a lot more relaxed than what I saw downstairs.\n\nWaiter showed up quick to the table, grabbed drink orders. Just to get it out of the way, service was fantastic the whole meal. Our waiter was very good, and very adept at handling somewhat drunk diners who were obviously going to continue that way.\n\nI decided on the Onion soup for an app. Now, I have to sadly admit that my beef wellington experience is mostly tied to Vegas buffets, so after being assured from my dining friends that \"uh, yea, the beef welly here isn't going to be anything like that\", which I figured sounded more than logical, I went with that for main, and got the sriracha broccoli for a side. Later on, got slightly nudged into ordering the sticky pudding.\n\n45 minute wait for the wellington, which went by pretty fast. The onion soup was really good, no over cheesing or breading. Perfect flavor, not over seasoned, it was good. The beef wellington arrives, it's REALLY good, looks and tastes great. Tender, rich, it cut like buttah. The sriracha broccoli was great as well, tender, with a spicy, but not overpowering flavor.\n\nFriend got a side of foie gras added to their steak order. Don't have a lot of experience with it, as I avoid a lot of liver associated food stuff, but wanted to try it, and it tasted great. The best I've had in memory. Rich as hell, I had several bites, and probably could have handled a few more. Great stuff.\n\nPretty well stuffed at that point, but one friend said \"I don't eat at someplace like this without getting dessert\". So, I went with the flow. Usually not a big fan of chocolate sweet dessert, but the \"cake\" type sticky pudding with the caramel (?) sauce and dollop of ice cream was great as well. I left a couple bites so I could play like I wasn't a complete pig, but doubt anybody fell for that.\n\nI think we all ordered the onion soup, and beef wellington, one friend did have the tomahawk steak, and there was a baked potato somewhere, so not much diversity going around. One did order a side of the truffle mac n cheese. I've had this before somewhere else, and while it was good, I'm just not a truffle oil kinda guy. Everyone else loved it.\n\nLike I said, best meal in a long time. Usually no matter where I eat at this level, there is something that is \"okay\", or \"average\", or something I didn't care for. Not here, not this time. I think I can say next Vegas trip, I'll probably come here again for the big meal."

In my time I enjoyed a couple of cocktails, picked away at an assortment of delicious bread and had good conversation with other patrons/staff. \n\nWhen my Wellington arrived I was impressed, the plating looked very precise and symmetrical..the only thing I did not really care for was the vegetable portion of the dish - not because of the flavor - trust me they were tangy, crunchy and awesome, but because there was literally 4 cubes the size of a Pico di Gallo cut that were included - it literally shouldn't have even been there or - otherwise mentioned if I could fit the entire contents on half a fork full. \n\nThe wellington had a great flavor, very robust flavoring and an assortment of buttery textures that I found to be extremely pleasing. Oh, the potatoes were OK too, but this was a dish that was all about the entree. \n\nWould I come here again? In a heartbeat - for the Wellington though, I would kick myself if I didn't order it every time I saw it on the menu next to other entrees. \n\nBill for 1 was around 120 with tip - booze included."

Beside the seared foie gras, it also has berries, marcona almond, some granola (i guess) on the plate. I initially thought how the heck these ingredients end up on the same plate. but later realized that if you combine all ingredients in 1 bite, it cuts through the fatty taste of the foie gras and at the same time enhancing the richness and pure taste of the foie gras and melt in your mouth.

Their still / mineral water both costs money.\n\nWe got the gnocchi -\nthe flavors were amazing.  It was fun eating them all together and then piece by piece to figure out how the flavors complement each other.\n\nThe breads (FREE) -\nholy crap... I loved all their different breads.  The truffle one and cheddar one is to die for.  Nice flaky and SAVORY.\n\nBeef Wellington (for 2) \n- you get 2 individual plates, it's just a larger beef wellington cut in half.  The filet mignon was soooo tender and the puff pastry and duxelle was amazing.  I kept closing my eyes when I was eating it because I was just so absorbed in it.  I think my date was somewhat annoyed at me but I couldn't help it.\n\nAs for food, that was plenty.  I'm the type of person who almost always get the buffet passes at vegas cuz it's actually worth it for me.  I was stuffed at the end of this meal - no desserts.   \n\nThe service is top-notch.  My date left her lapkin (i call it a lapkin cuz it's on your lap) messy on the table when she went to go to the restroom and the guy freakin comes and folds it up nicely and puts it back.  My water was CONSTANTLY filled.  They also did it in a way where it wasnt intruding.  I've been to a couple fancy expensive places but Gordon Ramsay really has these guys working hard."

IF you wanna try a more economical Gordan Ramsay, there are Gordan Ramsay burger places too. We'll try those next time.\n\nI will rave about their service. They were always very prompt and very kind. We were probably the youngest customers that night, but we felt we were still treated with amazing service. When we thought our Beef Wellington was a little overcooked, they gave us two new pieces. That was pretty unbelievable. \n\nThe only reason I'd give this place 4/5 stars is because we thought the Beef Wellington should have come out perfect the first time. IT was a lot better the second time. The Beef Wellington is supposed to be their specialty. Something that is quite unique.\n\nIf you're interested in some of the philosophy behind the restaurant, ask your server about the weird/interesting design on the ceiling. IT'll definitely make you look at Gordan Ramsay differently."

Also if you don't want to pay for water, ask for tap. The servers offer you only bottled still or carbonated water. \n\nI had the Beef Wellington and although it was good, I found the pastry slightly soggy, which caused the Wellington to fall apart,  and the filet was in need of just a pinch of salt. I also ordered the Hudson Valley Foie Gras with gooseberry jus and puff pastry stuffed with goat cheese. The dish was also good but I enjoyed the previous Foie Gras dish they had a year ago with heart of palm pur\u00e9e and maple waffles much more. \n\nMy dad ordered the Sword Fish and it arrived 15 minutes after everyone was served, which is usually considered a sin in fine dining. It was flavorful but a bit on the dry side. \n\nThe bread was amazing and we had multiple refills of it. \n\nFor dessert we did two orders of Sticky Toffee Pudding to share. The dessert is great but if you pour too much caramel sauce on it, as our server did, the dessert becomes too sweet to really enjoy. \n\nI am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay so I hold his food and recipes in high regard. I will give this place another try in the future."

We waited extremely long for a menu, then even longer for our order to be taken. We asked to be served bread since we were quite hungry from waiting, and I could see the waiter roll his eyes. Meanwhile a gentleman sits next to us and chats with the waiter about the menu. 60 seconds after that conversation a server walks up and begins to drop the bread at the table next to us, and I noticed the waiter motion to our table so we did finally get the bread. We started to notice that this person next to us was getting attentive and fast service when it struck me that he was a food/restaurant critic as he was taking notes on his phone after each conversation and bite of food. Professional or amateur I'm not sure, but he was given noticeably better service than any other table around.\nThe variety of bread was nice and included 2 types of brioche. We ordered sliders as an appetizer, which were pretty good. The main course: I ordered a special they had that night which was the \"eye\" of the ribeye, rare. He ordered the full ribeye, medium well and we ordered a baked potato to share (all sides are to be added on and are enough to share). My \"rare\" steak was medium and so was his \"medium-well\" ...I guess they just evened it out. The baked potato looked as though it had been sitting because the sauce on top had developed the film that warm dairy does after sitting. The steaks were tasty- can't say anything negative about the quality of the meat, and the skins of the potato were seasoned and delicious. I enjoyed that they bring around a \"meat tray\" that is like a dessert tray, except with all the cuts of steak offered. Can't say I would return next time I'm in Vegas, nor do I think I would recommend to friends."

They all got a food poisoning or something like that. They were all sick like a dog next day. Maybe I didnt drink the cocktail and didnt eat much steak.\n\nThey had one cocktail for each person.\nHK Antioxidant $14- fruity and ok strong\nPimm's cup $14- light, not impress,  wouldn't recommend. \nMaine lobster $26- sauce was different from last year. Not impressive.  Why did they change such a good sauce into some OK sauce? Disappointed\nFoie gras appetizer $25-they love it, but something look like the white marshmallow thing on the side tasted weird.\nFoie gras $18 as a side just SO Oily. You can see a lots of oil on the little pan.\nLongbone chop $99 pretty huge. 3 of us couldn't finish it. It should feed 4 people. Too burn outside, not juicy enough inside. It was ok for me. \nRibeye $57 they said pretty good, I couldnt chew on one of the piece. I only had 2 pieces of ribeye.\nMac & cheese was one of our favorite dish last year, but this year is the worst Mac & cheese I had ever have. It smells like GAS and the waiter said its truffle oil. We remember Gordon Ramsey said dont use truffle oil because it doesnt have truffle inside and it smells nasty. What a joke!!!\nToffee pudding-they said its a signature dish \nIce-cream was very good-the only thing I love the whole night. Wish they have more. The cake was ok and that toffee on the top was just TOO SWEET. u would feeling you are eating tons of sugar if you eat that cake with too much toffee on the top.\n\n$350 dinner that would make you sick like a dog. NO THANK YOU. My bro said No more Gordon Ramsey and I felt bad that 3 of them were punking and had a  diarrhea all night and day long. That was a definitely HELL'S KITCHEN. \n\n\n\n4 stars was given in 2013\nWe were stucked in traffic and we were late, so the dining area was closed and we just sitted at the bar area to eat. That's ok because we really wanted to try his food. The lobster and foie gras was soooooo good. Sauce was absolutely wonderful. Cocktail was good. The bread was very tasty, crispy and fresh. Bone-in Rib Eye was just ok. Filet is very good. Beef Wellington was not that good as we saw on the show. Didnt have that \"Wow\" moment. Mac and cheese was absolutely outstanding.  Didnt know a simple dish could be so good. Unforgettable. \n\nSo the appetizers and side order were way better than the Rib Eye and beef Wellington. \n\nIts pricey, but gotta try it once in your life."

We get there 35  minutes early and head over to the bar to get a drink or two while we wait for our table. I don't understand that other persons comment about looking dumb standing there because no waitress came up to them.  Stupid... We just asked the nearest waitress if we could sit at this table ( we pointed at an  empty table)  and she said sure.  Easy!  Promptly at our 7 pm reservation time a waitress found us and escorted us to our table.  Now comes the real experience.  Our waiter,  Dennis,  was friendly, professional and casual all wrapped up in one.  He attended to our needs  without fault.  Matter in fact,  everyone there showed remarkable professionalism.  I had the Wellington for my main.  It was better than I expected.  My wife had the ahi  steak medium.  She said it was delish.  Although I was pretty stuffed,  mind you I'm a 250 lb  guy and yes I was pretty stuffed,  Dennis suggested the sticky toffee pudding.  That was one of the best desserts I've ever eaten.  Now, while all this is happening,  there's this meat rack cart rolling around.  My God,  the cuts of meat on there ,raw, made me drool.  Thus, the reason I'm going back is to sink my teeth into one of them humongous porter house steaks.  To top things off,I got to meet Christina, winner of\nHells Kitchen  season 10.  Got to snap a photo with her and Dennis.  What an evening.  Definitely one to remember.  And,I got to share it all with my awesome wife.  We're both avid Gordon Ramsay  fans. I 100%  recommend this place to all."

My husband liked his ribeye but he says he wasn't \"wowed\" by it. The sides we got were Mac and cheese which was great and asparagus which was bland and a little too crunchy for my liking.

Drinks came at random times. The food was fine.\n\nThe worst part is the price. I get that it's Vegas, but $79 for fake Kobe - if it's American Wagyu don't call it Kobe and add $10 - is egregious.

Interesting and definitely not enough shrimp for the $21 price tag...  But that is not the reason why we came here.  We came for the steak... I think this is the NEW best steak ever.  I ordered the basic beef fillet with crusted bleu cheese cooked medium, and it was cooked to perfection.   My boyfriend decided to go with the Kobe beef fillet, and he was absolutely delighted.  We thought we had already ate the best steak elsewhere, but we were pleasantly surprised!!  We ate so fast and were wishing we could have seconds!\n\nService... Where do I began.  Scatterbrained?  That would be the correct term I think.  Instead of nice 2 hour meal which is what we would've expected...

My boyfriend and I were with another couple and enjoying ourselves, so the restaurant should just be happy that I'm being nice enough to give a good review. I doubt that Gordon Ramsey would approve of the incredibly slow service... Given his attitude towards his show \"Kitchen Nightmares.\"\n\nLoved the place, not a fan of the service!"

Excellent freshness and very favorable for both.  We had his famous Wellington... Omg so tender and juicy! .must have!  The cap was good as well but probably shoulda went with the ribeye :( the fingerling potatoes are so good with their truffle oil, must have as well.  The bone marrow was over the top. If u dont like fatty taste, like my gf, then u probably dont want to order this.  We closed out with his toffee cake... Unmm wth is this warm sweetness amazingness in my mouth....n no thats ice creeam not butter haha excellent restaurant."

Up until the end and actually was approaching five star but I have to say that they lost little ground as we were checking out.\nWe chose not to order the tasting menu but instead order off the menu menu. Each course was excellent and the attention by the waiter and other staff was terrific. The trouble began when my friends who have his dining with apologize because she'd ordered Caesar salad without remembering that it came with anchovies. The waiter offered to substitute or something without which she excepted. Unfortunately when she received still had anchovies in it. The waiters were didn't that when we looked up the name of the dressing off the description on Google it was made with anchovies \nI ordered the in Steak and it was amazing I've never had steak like that before. From what I understand most places don't serve it because it requires that you dispose of a portion of perfectly good steak to make it but wow is it worth it. At the end I ordered coffee which  came with spoons covered in chocolate and amaretto or dark chocolate or raspberry to float into it to flavor the coffee. I also ordered his famous coffee dessert which was simply amazing. I guess my only disappointment was when we went to check out The waiter had not removed the salad from my friends check and acted put out when she asked to have it reduced from the bill. I haven't been to a lot of really nice restaurants but the ones I have been would never behave that way.   Food was definitely 5 to 10 stars and most of the service is quite good I just found out that left a bad taste in my mouth."

            "review": "Hmmm, where to begin.  If you like a steak medium to medium well, here is not the place to get it.  You either get a burnt or raw steak.\nWe all asked for waters to begin with while we read the menus.  I guess that set the tone.  We received our waters and 20 minutes later finally received food menus, but nothing was offered as far as drinks.\nOut of the 6 of us in our group, none were impressed.  We had heard so many great things (from TV) so maybe our expectations were a little too high?  Far be it for me to want a medium well cooked steak (yeah I know for the steak that could be seen as an insult) but that's how I like it.  \nWhat I got was literally charcoal on an extremely well done (burnt) steak.  When I put  my fork into, the charcoal literally flaked off.  The servers were kind and offered to have my steak cooked again and I nicely said \"no thank you,\" BUT they insisted.  So I asked for just a bit above medium.  My next steak was so rare in the middle it bled onto my plate.  \nMy husband and I ordered mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  The potatoes were $12 and truly nothing special, the macaroni and cheese left us burping mushroom flavor for an hour after eating 2 bites.  \nWe tried to be nice about everything and were maybe hoping there might be something great in the dessert, but we wouldn't know because we were never offered a desert menu, just our checks.\nFortunately, my steak was taken off, but I feel that $12 on potatoes and average service in a two hour time span is not what I was hoping for nor expecting.  Bummed to say, total disappointment."

Thankfully we had reservations as the place was full.  We were not disappointed.  The fantastic evening started with the service. Our server, Charles,  explained the menu, showed us the steak trolly and introduced us to the Hell!s Kitchen tasting menu (HKTM). The one catch with the HKTM is everyone at the table must order it.  We decided to go with it based on Charles thorough description. I recommend the wine pairing with that. In addion we added a 3 ounce potion of  A5 Kobe Filet at a pricey $30/oz. It was worth it, beyond expectation. It was truely the best mest we ever had.   the stick toffee pudding was wonderful.   The whole experience was 5 star and worth the $700 rice tag."

            "review": "First, let me say, I never ever write reviews but I felt I could not keep quite.\n\nMy wife and I had reservations last night. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated. Problem was, we were seated along a wall, right in front of the elevator, behind the waiters stations. The seating along the wall was a bench style seat that ran the length of 6 tables for two. Was not happy with where they sat us. Those around us, all couples, had the same complaint. We have had better and more comfortable tables at Outback.\n\nWe started with the Cauliflower and curry soup. Nothing special here. The soup had the consistency of milk, was not creamy, the curry was over powering, and on top of that, it needed salt to give it some flavor. As Mr. Ramsey always says, don't be afraid to season the dish. Guess this chef forgot that message.\n\nFor the main course, my wife ordered the signature Beef Wellington and I had the Lamb. The Wellington is to be cooked medium rare, at least that is what the menu specifies. When it arrived 45 minutes later, it was not even cooked to \"rare\", it was damned near raw. We brought this to the attention of our waiter who indicated they would get it taken care of. He returned a few minutes later, put the menu in front of here, asked her to make another selection as any other Wellington would be prepared exactly the same way. WTF? The table next to us also had the Wellington and it was cooked perfectly. Rather than wait another 45 minutes, she ordered the Salmon. This arrived in approx. 10 minutes. Apparently the chef forgot to use seasoning, because it also needed salt. We think he also forgot how to use heat, because the Salmon was close to being sushi.\n\nThe lamb was ordered \"medium\" but once it got to the table, it was closer to \"well\" than any where near \"medium\". This also needed salt.\n\nWe have eaten in restaurants all over the United States and Internationally. This was the worst dining experience and meal we have ever had from what is considered to be a high end restaurant. Next time we want a fine dining experience we will go to Morton's, Ruth Chris, Harry Careys, Flemings, Maestro's, or even Outback (LOL). It appears that customer satisfaction is not high on the priority list. Our impression was that the experience was not about the customer, it was about the restaurant and the name associated with it.\n\nIf you are going for the dining experience, don't bother. Food is not all it is made out to be. If you are going just so you can say you have been to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant's, well then, good luck."

It's about 50 minutes from when you place your order until the food is actually in front of you. (If you add your decision time before that and then eating time after that, you can do the math.) If you are paying a babysitter or have a show to get to, keep this in mind when booking your reservation. \n3) Avoid sticker shock and do your research before going. It is NOT an inexpensive meal but it's worth it! You get what you pay for in this instance. \n4) if you hate the whole \"wine menu on the iPad\" thing as much as I do, then mentally prepare yourself, because they have them. Booooo.

The inside is sleek and beautiful. We were lucky enough to score a table opening weekend and a fantastic table by the kitchen at that! When we arrived Gordon was standing in the kitchen right behind me! He was on his way out the door but graciously posed for a few pictures before he left, unfortunately I wasn't one of the lucky patrons who scored a picture but that is totally my fault. \n\nI dined with my husband and a friend and we went all out. I started with the roasted beets, which was beautifully plated and so delicious. I was intrigued by the \"pumpernickel\" soil, which thankfully was some grated pumpernickel bread. Everything worked perfectly together. \n\nWe tried 3 entrees and literally just passed the plates around the table. I ordered the duo of lamb which included the most perfect lamb chops I have ever tasted and a Shepard's pie. The Shepard's pie was only ground lamb and mashed potatoes, no peas, carrots etc. I really wished it included more vegetables because it was just too savory without them. My husband dined on the Kobe rib cap and it was such a stunning piece of meat. You think you have tasted steak, but until you sink your teeth into this steak you haven't! I don't like my meat bloody, but now I get the whole red meat thing. This wasn't bloody, but delicate and tender. My friend had the beef wellington and it's a signature dish for a reason! It was stunning and cooked perfectly. My lamb and my friend's wellington both included peas, carrots, and pureed potatoes. Despite this, we each decided to order a side, which was a mistake because the portions here are actually good sized for the price. I enjoyed the mac and cheese and was especially pleased to find peas mixed in, what an awesome surprise. The spring succotash was refreshing but the pork belly definitely put it over top. I wasn't super pleased with the asparagus, I think it lacked a bit in the flavor department. My husband also got a lobster tail with his steak which was of course delicious. \n\nWe decided that despite the fact that we were busting at the seams, we really must try a dessert. That was a fantastic decision! We got the cheesecake and didn't regret it for a moment. It was so creamy and delicious, and topped with a strawberry granita which really worked well. The plate was streaked with graham cracker crumbs and blueberries. My only regret was not ordering my own. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic meal and we expected nothing less. Service was absolutely impeccable, again just as we expected. We will absolutely be back and I look forward to trying more of the menu. There is a reason Gordon Ramsay is so famous, it's not his attitude people, it's his food!"

            "review": "Gordon Ramsey's STEAK restaurant had great atmosphere and the staff was very friendly however, I do have a few complaints, myself and my party of approximately 5 others sat up stairs around a large round table which seemed to sit relatively close to the other tables and patrons and normally this would not have been but because of the close proximity of the tables the wait staff continually pushed (vigorously) against my chair as they passed through to serve the patrons at the table beside mine and this proved to be rather annoying as the evening went on. Other than the table issue that was my only complaint about the wait staff or the restaurant itself, now on to the food, the steak was delicious! I ordered a cut called the \"rib cap\" which as the server stated this is \"Gordon Ramsey's\" favorite because it is a cross between two other cuts. My steak was medium and cooked to absolute perfection, the flavor was wonderful and the texture was like butter! Steak definitely is their speciality however everything else was pretty subpar or not worthy of a $800 check. The fingerling potatoes were equivalent to almost any restaurant as was the Mac and cheese and the Brussels sprouts, I expected the sides to be much better but the quality just wasn't there. My wife ordered the sea bass which was visually beautiful but definitely left much to be desired in the flavor department, I was really disappointed with her dish because although I realize we are in the middle of the desert, I would have hoped the fish would still have been better than those found throughout restaurants in Las Vegas. Their saving grace however, the drinks were amazing and I highly recommend the \"south side\" which is a play on a mojito but uses champagne."

Service was excellent. The meat trolley was a really fun & unique way for them to display their cuts. I ordered the Wellington, and the meat melted in my mouth. Delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the rest of it, though. The meat alone was more than filling. One friend ordered the short rib, but it was too salty for her. My other two friends ordered the Fisherman's Grill & both said it was the best seafood they'd ever had. \n\nWe also ordered side dishes to share: the loaded baked potato, roasted heirloom carrots & the mac & cheese. I was pretty full by this point, so didn't try the potato, but they said it was good. The carrots were good but spicy, and the mac & cheese, we all could have eaten a gallon tub of it. It was divine. \n\nWe ordered the sticky toffee pudding w/ brown butter ice cream for dessert & it was worthy of plate licking (we didn't). SO good. They brought out a very yummy complimentary ice cream for my birthday. All in all, a delicious meal & a restaurant we'll def return to next time we're in Vegas."

I have to admit, I was really impressed with both the food and the staff.  Our waiter was upbeat, knowledgeable, and very helpful with the menu selections.  Now, onto the food.  We were a group of eight, so we shared a little bit here and there.  I ordered the Kobe Rib Cap-medium; very delish and tender.  I also sampled the Bone In Ribeye and the Beef Wellington.  The Ribeye was juicy, tender, and tasty.  The Beef Wellington was \"melt in your mouth\" delicious!  I will be ordering that the next time I go.  Our sides were the Mac and Cheese, Mushrooms, and Fingerling potatoes.  All of these were portioned well and again, very tasty.  I ordered the Raviolo for an appetizer... I'm with the other reviewer on this one-I expected more than just one... but by definition, it is singular.  I sampled the Pork Belly... this is my favorite of everything I tried that night.  If you are going to order one app, I highly recommend the Pork Belly.  I was told the Hamachi was excellent as well.  We also had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert.  It is extremely rich and filling.  One of these is good for 3 average diners, we split amongst 8 and it was still satisfying.  Overall, I had a wonderful experience and will be going back again when I go to Vegas.  Four 1/2 stars because the music was a little too loud; that is one of my pet peeves when dining.  Other than that, it was a perfect meal at a reasonable price.  My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and agreed that GR Steak was an awesome experience"

I had figured, an early reservation (only one I could get) would have made for a better experience, but truly it didn't.  We had reservation between 5 - 530pm, roughly an hour or so after the restaurant opened, and still we were there for over 2 hours.  Our main entrees took the longest and our waiter only told us once that our food was next up or something along those lines.  And you would think possibly a discount would've been accommodated to our bill, but not at all.  If you want to experience this, go for it.  But I will never go again.  The food was okay.  We had one entr\u00e9e \"Oscar\" and that was a bit salty.  FYI, don't order sauces, the meats are awesome in their own juices and you'd only be wasting another $7."

I did feel the interaction between the employees and customer was a little awkward though. Long paused communication with stiff presentation.

Everything on the menu is a la cart and in my opinion, fairly priced for what you get. If you don't know steak cuts, don't worry they wheel a steak cart out to show you what they have. My girlfriend and I got the filet and rib cap steak (medium and medium-rare), and they were outstanding - perfect color. I thought the filet was the better of the two. We also ordered crab legs - great portion, already cut, and very tasty. We shared a plate of bone barrow as well - first time and it was delicious. \n\nSides are big enough to share between two or even three people and everyone can get seconds. The cream corn is amazing! I recommend. The potato pur\u00e9e and asparagus were good, too.\n\nDessert was phenomenal.

They asked if we wanted to be seated, so we thought, \"why not\" because we had a show in about two hours and figured better safe than sorry.  Apparently \"being seated\" means just that because literally no one came over for the next ten minutes - no menu, no water, just sitting there like assholes.  And, although the walk to the table was all of maybe 50 feet, we apparently looked like we might get lost or fall because not one, but two hookers, I mean hostesses, had to accompany us and give us the speech about the \"journey\" and the art installation.  I am all for having the ladies look nice, but v point hems directing you to their hoo ha and barely covering their rear is not classy.\n\nWe finally got the drink i-pad and saw you could \"select\" your choices on there - because you might \"forget\" between the huge gap in time between when you get it and when the waiter actually comes back to take the order.  And we also were not told that the still water was bottled and for a fee, not that we cared about the cost, but it is tacky not to inform the customer.\n\nThe bread selections are pretentious as well - lemony focaccia and the like.

Believe me, if you are eating at a place like this and don't know your meat already, looking at it raw is not going to mean anything to you.\n\nWe ordered (half dozen oysters, lamb duet, haricot vert, carrots, bone marrow, pork belly, prime filet) and then I spilled my drink because the cocktail glasses are so large around that you cannot possibly get a good grip.  NO ONE CAME OVER!!  I guess you have to actually break the glass (like someone next to us) before someone will do something.  I cleaned up the spill with the husband's napkin, placing ice on my bread plate and that sat there until the final moments of the meal and we had to ask for another napkin.  We also had to continually ask for more bottles of water and to get the drink i-pad back to order something else.  Seriously?  Are you not out to make money?  Was our $300 meal not enough for you?  Did we do something to offen the ghost of Gordon (who apparently only comes in once every two months or so and was \"busy\" at MGM Grand that night - hopefully learning a thing or two about good service and food at Craftsteak)\n\nThe meal itself was split - husband said the green salsa on his marrow was bad, they should have just put sea salt on it.  He did like the filet.  My lamb was overcooked, tough and plain awful.  The shepherd's pie was also way too salty and other than that had no taste.  The oysters were the balndest things I have ever had, even with the \"champagne mignette\" or cocktail sauce added.  Carrots hd a curry added to them and the green beans were literally the best part of my meal - how sad.\n\nWhen we got the dessert menu, I almost laughed aloud.  The selections on there reminded me of things you expect out of a cheap chain with carrot cake and I am not kidding here - banoffee pie.  I told the husband not to waste more of his money on this poor excuse for a dessert selection and we attempted to get the check.  The server - who had been MIA for a LONG time at this point, was \"SHOCKED\" that we didn't order anything, not even coffee - which I know because he shared this with the assistant server literally two steps away from our table.  I was willing him to ask me about it so I could lay into him.\n\nWe also had the lovely experience of seeing the floor manager \"radio\" to the front about our table (I know we were 42 because it was on the check) saying \"five minutes on 42\" - when we were not even done with our drinks and had just paid the check two second before.  Gee, it was before 8 and we had a 6:15 reservation, I am sorry if we are taking up your space.\n\nDon't waste your time or money on this garbage.  I will never be able to watch his shows again and the husband, who was a true fan, was totally disappointed in what was supposed to be the highlight of our trip."

The valets are dressed in stereotypical Parisian stripes, and you must cross under the humongous foot of La Tour Eiffel inside the casino to get to Gordon Ramsay Steak.\n\nIn keeping with the subtle details of Las Vegas design, you must pass through the Chunnel designed to transport guests from Paris to the United Kingdom.  This metaphorical journey is subtle but the massive fifty foot Union Jack on the ceiling is anything but.  There can be no doubt that you have arrived at Ramsay's place.  The hustle and bustle of smoothly functioning kitchen and wait staff permeates the room while guests seems quietly in awe of the house built by America's hottest TV chef.\n\nThe booths in the upstairs balcony provide a sense of privacy, but the myriad of servers quickly keep you from feeling neglected.  A server's assistant places an interactive iPad on the table and teaches us how to navigate through the digital menu.  There is also, some interesting background data on Chef Gordon.  Our waiter, Yaron, was explaining the menu and its multitude of options, when he drops the ultimate bomb on our table; \"we also have an exclusive chef's tasting menu for a limited time\".  Done, we are now treated to five courses of culinary bliss complete with wine pairings and dessert.\n\nThere were moments when you could see Chef Gordon's classical training, there were moments when you could see the quasi-arrogant TV personality showing off and there were times when you felt like the Scot from Stratford England was just a bloke looking to feed his mates from down the pub.\n\nChef's mastery of the preparation of beets with pumpernickel soil was a lesson in culinary flavor and texture teamwork.  The world famous Wellington beef was prepared to perfection; of course.  However, when we read that fish and chips were next on our pairing meal we couldn't quite wrap our minds around it.  I made the snide comment \"it better come with a pint\" while quietly trying to figure out what wine would accompany fish and chips.  When the aesthetically appealing plates hit the table the sommelier was right around the corner with glasses and a bottle of Fin du Monde Ale.  Chef Ramsay was dazzling our minds and our mouths while remaining true to his roots.  \n\nThis chef's menu was not cheap, coming in at $170 per person (with wine pairings).  However, if having a culinary experience with a mastermind as your guide isn't enough to give you the celebrity experience, you also get an autographed photo of the TV star himself.\n\nThe experience is one that you should not miss out on during your trip to Vegas.  As for locals like myself, we now have a new restaurant to call home for every visitor that comes to Vegas."

I was kind of MEH about it, b/c only old people make reservations that early, right? but i was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant fairly full at that time. we were seated right away and as we walked in the hostess said the big red neon thingy in the ceiling was \"chef ramsay's hand motions as he made beef wellington.\" ummm, yeah, ok, whatever. that was kind of cheesy. overall i was expecting more refined decor in the restaurant, but it was kind of las vegas nightclub - this was one of the few disappointing things we encountered. \n\nanyway, we were led to the absolute best seat in the house, which was a booth facing the kitchen, with no tables in front of us. the booth was really comfortable and we had a great view of what was going on as the night progressed.\n\nwe were asked about water almost immediately and I should have known that anything other than tap water would cost money ($9 for a bottle of still water, to be exact). note for next time. after that we had to wait quite a while for menus. we were very hungry so it was initially annoying to wait, but once we started getting served food, a little wait between courses was good so we didn't get too full. our waiter chris was really great, and so was his assistant (can't remember his name, but he was SO NICE and accommodating - he took our picture, etc.). the service was excellent overall! we ordered:\n\nonion soup\ncaesar salad\nfoie gras appetizer\nwagyu rip cap for my bf\nrib eye for me\ncreamed spinach side\nbaked potato side\napple tarte tatin dessert\nsticky toffee pudding dessert\n\nhonestly everything was excellent except that i should have ordered new york strip instead of rib eye, and the spinach and potato sides could have used more salt. the potato skin was really salty but the flesh wasn't, and the lardon didn't add enough seasoning to make a difference. i don't really like ribeye but i always feel like i should, so i ordered that when i should have ordered new york strip or kobe/wagyu steak. i agree with everyone else that the american rib cap is SO. TASTY. \n\ni do have to say that the appetizers and desserts were really the standouts - the butter ice cream was honestly the best ice cream i've ever eaten, and the only deficiency was my ribeye. a sauce or a kobe steak, and a little bit of salt here and there would have made the evening perfect. \n\noverall we had a fantastic time and it was mostly worth the price!"

Or the food may be amazing, but so tiny in portion that you leave hungry.  Boy,  I was totally wrong about this place, mind blowing level of amazing food!  We went here for my bachelorette party dinner and we were seated upstairs in a side room for a group of 8.  Staring with the bread, they had prosciutto brioche, black truffle brioche, a lemony ciabatta, and one additional bread.  The bread was warm when it arrived to the table, already a good start to the meal.  We ordered the Kurobuta pork belly and grits appetizer x 2 and the fried blue point oysters.  Both of these were delicious and we ended up scraping the plate for the rest of the cheesy grits.  The creme fraiche tarter sauce was creamy goodness paired with the perfectly fried oysters.  On to the entrees, normally I go ribeye at steakhouses but after watching enough episodes of Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, how can you not order the Beef Wellington?!  But as a compromise, my friend and I shared the Wellington and also shared a 24 oz ribeye (both medium rare).  I like that they bring the butcher's cart out with all the different cuts of meat and explain the marbling and quality of each so you know what you are getting.  We also ordered the brussel sprouts, loaded baked potato, and mac and cheese for sides to share.  Overwhelmingly, the Beef Wellington was the highlight of the meal.  The meat literally melts in your mouth as you take each bite!  I would order this over steak any day.  The other strange thing is the Beef Wellington is less than $60 and so was the 24 oz ribeye.  Normally, I expect to pay upwards to $80+ for steakhouses on the Strip.  I was baffled by the lower than expected price and the higher than expected quality.  For any Chinese person, this is a win win situation!  The ribeye was marbled perfectly and seasoned to perfection as well.  But hands down I would order the Beef Wellington again, next time I come here.  The portion size is also very large, we easily could have shared either the ribeye or the wellington and not ordered another entree.  The sides were also good, I would probably pass on the loaded baked potato next time but the mac and cheese was flavorful and creamy.  The brussel sprouts were crispy and the acidity from the vinaigrette paired beautifully.  To cap off an amazing meal, we ordered the famous sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I thought it would be overly sweet, but I mean this is probably one of the best desserts I have ever had.  The ice cream paired with the moist cake was indescribable!  For your next any kind of celebration come here....or just make up a reason to come!"

Wellington was cooked perfectly - meat was to tender, like butter! But I wasn't crazy about the overall flavor. I really couldn't taste the mushrooms. Eh, but the meat was divine! Potato puree was silky and the best thing ever! Mac and cheese was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. Hubby had double pork chop and he loved it. I even got to taste it - amazing! Sticky Toffee Pudding with brown butter ice cream was to die for. Hubby has a chocolate pudding thing. He said it was very good. The only downside was that it was served in a dish that makes licking the bowl impossible. We can't wait to return. Pricy, yeah. But this is Vegas and you should indulge while here.

The atmosphere was amazing! However, the server left much to be desired. We were ignored for the first 15 minutes of us being there. After our drink orders it took another 20 minutes before we were shown our meat choices. Every interaction with him was very rushed and he talked very fast. We felt like just because we are younger we were ignored but our money is just as good as an established couple. They knew we were there on our honeymoon and he still gave us subpar service. My husband ordered a medium rib eye and it came rare and he asked for a butter and bacon baked potato and it came with all the fixings. My husband then asked for more butter for his baked potato and the server forgot but remembered when he came to check on us 20 minutes later. Overall the food was fantastic, without a doubt, but our server left much to be desired."

On top of that, I much prefer a little hole-in-the-wall to a restaurant boasting a chef's name. That being said, trying Gordon Ramsay's Beef Wellington was on my boyfriend's bucket list, so here I am. \n\nFirst off, the staff at Steak are incredibly accommodating. We originally made a reservation for three, but my sister ducked out at the last minute. Not a problem for them. We also showed up about 25 minutes early and were seated at the bar first. When our table was ready, they allowed us to finish up our cocktails and appetizer before we headed upstairs. By the time we reached our table, I had managed to convince my sister to join us after all. Our server was incredibly flexible with us yet again. Likewise, they were very welcoming to my non-red-meat-eating soul, as they explained the options for me and adjusted our selection of breads to have fewer featuring pancetta and more loaded with truffles! The table in front of us further evidenced their accommodating nature. The woman seated across from us didn't find her chair to be comfortable, so they substituted it for another style of chair. When that wasn't to her liking and she traded seats with her husband (right back to the original throne-like chair), they switched the table setting around for her. Please don't be that person, but, if you must, the folks at Steak will take care of you!\n\nOn to the food and drinks: The cocktails were excellent. I ordered a Southside, and was made a Sidecar by mistake, but I enjoyed it thoroughly so I completely excused that. (When I actually got a Sidecar, that was delicious too.) We decided to start with the Truffle Mac N' Cheese as a an appetizer. Great call! Very rich and creamy. To kill time before my sister arrived, we split a Caesar Salad. Very tasty, though $17 for six unchopped pieces of lettuce and a few croutons makes me want to die a little inside. Ah, the irony of fancy food, more money, less food. The dinner roll selection was delicious. The Beef Wellington lived up to my boyfriend's high expectations, while the Fisherman's platter was a nice sampler of salmon, lobster, scallops, mussels, and Ahi tuna for me. My sister's Fish and Chips was spot on as well.\n\nAll in all, we had a great dinner experience at Steak. It'll cost you, but it's worth savoring!"

Delighted they let me in, seated in the loungey bar area, appreciating the May-opened first presence of someone that I actually oddly and inexplicably respect: Gordon Ramsay.\n\nHe inspired a 2nt/3day jaunt to London a few years ago, in fact. The odd things I manage to do on a whim.\n\nNo steak had I at 2230 in the evening, but the steak dishes of neighboring patrons digging in looked and smelled quite beefy!! Myself, asked the chef for a special. Am a humongous fan of Scotch eggs ( tribute to Ramsay's humble origins), and I have never had a quail egg prepared in that style. It being the amuse on the tasting menu, I actually got a \"Yes\", and it was made for me. Together with the $25 seared foie gras with pea sprouts, homemade berry compote, and the best mini homemade crumpets to write him and tell one's city about! Unfortunately, the sear touch was amiss and didnt sit in a hit enough pan. I prefer the texture of my fg a bit more done as well.\n\nLike the interior of the restaurant inside the Paris, Has nice touches, classy....dark, the way I like it.\n\nSo happy I decided last minute to cross the street and see if I could get in: wonderful nightcap snack..a treat."

FFF (Fury for Flavor).\n\nSpecial note on decoration: The red neon sculpture on the ceiling represents Chef Ramsay's hand movements as he prepares the Beef Wellington.\n\nSpecial note on tasting menu: There was the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu (Scotch Egg, Potato and Octopus Salad, Scallop Risotto, Beef Wellington, Sticky Toffee Pudding - $145 per person + additional $75 for wine pairings). If you are looking for Chef Ramsay's scallop, you will have to order the tasting menu because scallop is not on the regular menu.\n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter immediately gave us the iPad with wine and cocktail menus. A moment later, meat / steak cart suddenly appeared as our waiter explained different cuts of meat.\n\nThe overall service was exceptional with one minor hiccup. One of waiter was about to serve Kurobuta pork belly, but later he realized that blue crab soup was supposedly come out first because that was technically what I've requested. Not like I cared about which dish came 1st, but the waiter took the pork belly back to the kitchen and we basically had to wait another 15+ minutes for the soup to come out. \n\nBreads - Free Refills (Lemon Focaccia w/ Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom w/ Pancetta + Pork Fat, Baguette w/ Blue Cheese, Butter w/ Volcanic Sea Salt) - Black truffle mushroom bread was amazing, baguette was decent, and lemon focaccia was average. Sea salt butter was one of the smoothest butter I've had.\n\nBlue Crab Soup (blue crab, corn, red curry - $17 Total Rewards Member, $18 Regular Price) - Creamy texture with a bit of sweetness, sourness, and spiciness all in one bowl. Full of flavors and a pretty good soup. \n\nKurobuta Pork Belly (cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus - $18 Total Rewards Member, $19 Regular Price) - Pretty good pork belly (some portion of meat was melt-in-your-mouth good), but all that tomato jam and onion pork just didn't enhance the overall flavor of pork belly.\n\nFingerling Potatoes (parmesan, truffle - $11 Total Rewards Member, $12 Regular Price): It has this very interesting roasted flavor - did not regret this order.\n\nRoasted Beef Wellington (medium rare w/ 45 minutes wait, glazed root vegetables, potato pur\u00e9e, red wine demi-glace - $99 for 2 Total Rewards Member, $101 for 2 Regular Price) - This should be the best order right? Well ... not at THAT price level. Well seasoned beef with flaky golden crust - so I could see the appeal, but I still prefer the traditional juicy cut steak. \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream - $13 Total Rewards Member, $14 Regular Price) - Ho, ho ho! Definitely best order of the day. Such an amazing dessert ... and brown butter ice cream was the BOMB! One of the hardest ice cream to cut with a spoon, so I just stabbed it with my fork and took one bite at a time. Simply the right sweetness and texture for pudding cake - man, so amazing. \n\nOver-hyped prices, pretty good appetizers and the Beef Wellington, and out-of-this-world sticky toffee pudding. Probably not worth $300 meal (for 2 or 3) because I am pretty sure you can get better food with that kind of money, but it is still not a bad choice for the special occasion (or your are simply a Gordon Ramsay's fan and say \"I've visited his restaurant ... at least once in my lifetime!\")."

I tried the broccoli with Sriracha and egg as one of the side and it was tasty.  It could've been a 5-star experience but the sommelier was a real tool.  No introduction, no checking on our table after the first pour, really unpersonable and pretentious. For a first-rate restaurant to have this guy as their somm is a serious misstep."

Filet was amazing but pastry was soggy\n(-) unfriendly reception staff\n(-) uncomfortable pressure from waiter (Charles)\n(-) dry bone-in ribeye\n(+) restaurant manager asked to \"let us fix that\"\n(-)(-)(-) cost for \"let us fix that\" appeared on our bill\n\nThe long story\nDecided to splurge on Gordon Ramsey steak for our 4 year anniversary because my husband and I enjoy watching master chef together. Unfortunately, this dinner may have ruined more than just our evening... I wonder if future episodes of the show would just bring back the bitter burnt taste of tonight's steak whenever I see our favorite chef-hosts on the tele...\n\nI'll gloss over the minor cons and focus on the major cons.\nMajor cons - waiter, professional but manipulative and unapologetic. My husband's steak (Bone-in ribeye) came out dry. Like charcoal dry. In fact it looked and tasted like charcoal too... But it was a special night, we didn't want to sour things, so since we were 70% full just on my beef Wellington, we thought we'd just pay for our meal and cut our losses. The plan was conveyed to the waiter that we wished to get our bill. Waiter noticed that my husbands steak was more or less untouched. So the manager(?) then comes by insisting on making it up to us, offering to redo our steak, then recommending changing the steak to a different more expensive cut. Mind you, we were full from other items and all the waiting already, but didn't want to be rude, so we complied. \n\nOur mistake is that we assumed that this was their way of making amends, not their way of squeezing an extra $20 out of their already unsatisfied customers... When we got our bill, we were billed the full additional amount, along with the sauce ($7) that was recommended to \"remedy\" the original burnt steak. At this point we were fed up, we payed our bill and left.\n\nWe noticed our waiter (Charles) did not ask us for a yelp review like he did the other tables. For reference for staff, we dined on 8/26/2015, on the 2nd level, reservation time 8:00pm. \n\nTo reiterate, disappointing. Not the cost, not even the food. What disappoints me is the embarrassing service. I expect more from a high end restaurant. I expected more from our hero Gordon Ramsey. I hope this review makes it to your attention, I am thoroughly disappointed in the way your restaurant is run."

The waiter we had was standoffish, didn't make an effort to have a conversation with us or even smile! He also asked if we wanted sparkling water or still, which I assumed meant tap, so I selected the latter; later on we found out that the water alone cost $9! \n\nI didn't think the bread was anything special either and seemed too greasy. We ordered the jumbo prawn appetizer to share which was okay; I got the rib cap and my husband selected the American eye, which was essentially rib eye wrapped in bacon. His steak was cooked unevenly while mine was medium rare, the way I wanted it. I can't say that the rib cap was the best steak I ever had, but it wasn't bad either. On the other hand, the two side dishes were mediocre (the creamed corn was way too sweet as if they had emptied a bag of sugar in it and the macaroni and cheese tasted bland). I thought the dessert that everyone raved about (toffee pudding) was good but the accompanying ice cream tasted strange (too salty). I wouldn't return for the food since it was too expensive for what we got."

Unfortunately, the lobsters and their sauce ruined the steak! It was super salty and way too rich that I wanted to vomit. We had to throw away the last piece of lobster meat... Such a shame, throwing away lobsters is such a waste. The worst part is that this \"oscar style\" cost me $54 extra. The steak itself cost $61. I walked out of this restaurant feeling duped!.

They gave me a reservation number which was efficient but told me if I cancelled after 24 hrs my credit card would be charged for $50 for each person.  I was Ok with that. \nFrom the moment we were greeted it was a wonderful experience.  I felt like I was on the Titanic.  I was greeted and wished a very happy birthday by the hostess and she took us to the elevator and we went upstairs where they had prepared our table which was a booth and two chairs added to the end.  Once we got off the elevator, staff were there to great us and each and everyone of them ( even those who were not serving us ) wished me happy birthday. It was first class!  Our server was Donny and he did an amazing job!  He ensured we were all a happy by starting us off with cocktails with the famous iPad.  I had done research on the menu and already knew what I wanted to order.  I had the English Garden and Pims cocktails.  The English Garden was refreshing, it had cucumber and basil.  And i couldn't resist the Pims, having lived in UK for many years, it is my favorite!  Most of my friends ordered a salad to start but I ordered the Lobster starter which was fabulous!   They of course brought out the meat tray and presented what was available . The tray even had mirrors on it so you could see the cut from anywhere you were sitting.  For main courses we ordered the Kobe Steak ( amazingly tender!), the beef wellington( brilliant!) and one of my friends ordered the salmon which she said was the best she ever had!  Then there were the sides. \nWe ordered the mushrooms which were out of this world! Brussel Sprouts were good, spinach was cooked to perfection ( we ordered two) , but the best was the mac and cheese!  I don't normally like mac and cheese but seriously this was amazing!! I had never tasted mac and cheese like that!  The service was impeccable. We were never disturbed unless we really needed to have our water or glasses filled or there was another dish to order.  The service was first class!  Even their general \nmanager stopped by to wish me a Happy 50th birthday and gave me his card. Their staff did a great job ! By the time dessert came around we were so full we just couldn't do it.  We did order the Sticky Toffee and all shared.  It was incredible.  When they brought the French pressed office and chocolate liquor spoons well that was it!  It was such a nice touch to an amazing dinning experience!\nDonny our waiter actually made our evening.  He took pictures and let us take pictures with him.  He offered to take us down to the kitchen but we weren't allowed to go behind the counter.  The only disappointing factor of the evening was their famous chef, Christina Wilson was not very accommodating when we asked for a picture as a group to celebrate my 50th, nor was she willing to even give an autograph on at least one of our Gordan Ramsey bags that Donny gave to us all. \nConsidering the amount of money I spent there, I would think she would have been happy to do that for us. But no....she was too busy stuffing that bake potato with sour cream....and looked stressed just managing that. \nOverall, it was an amazing dinning experience.  We are all still talking about that night and each of my friends told me its the best dinning experience they have ever had!!!!!!  BRAVO CHEF RAMSEY!!!  Can't wait to try your Pub and Grill at Caesars!"

The decor, staff, and food were brilliant, just brilliant (as the British would say).  I came here on a Saturday night with an early reservation at 4:45pm, but even though we were 10 minutes late, the table was still available and we were lucky enough to be seated by the kitchen.  I loved watching the chefs and servers as they busily moved through the kitchen, so much action comparable to Gordon Ramsay's \"Hell's Kitchen,\" yet the staff worked very well as a team.   We had the limited edition tasting menu for $145 a person. This included 5 dishes that could be complimented with wine for an additional $75.  The beef Wellington was so tender and flavorful, it made my teeth happy from not having to do as much work.  I recommend you make an early dinner reservation so that you can enjoy your meal and not feel too rushed, that way you still have time to catch a show, go gamble, or dance the night away.  Go ahead and splurge at Gordon Ramsay Steak, you deserve it!"

When my dad and I were planning a trip to Las Vegas, I jumped at the opportunity to try my third of his restaurants.\n\nGordon Ramsay Steak has a rather lively atmosphere, with hopping music. From the very beginning, the hostesses were extremely friendly and welcoming. Our server also did an amazing job. We never had to wait for a drink or anything else.\n\nAll of the appetizers sounded incredible, but we settled on the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. This dish is served with herbed goat cheese pop-overs, gooseberry jus, and pickled ramps. It was phenomenal! The velvety texture of the foie gras and the crunchy nuts complimented each other beautifully. The popovers were also the perfect vehicle to tie everything together, and the gooseberry jus added just the right amount of sweetness. It was a real pleasure to eat.\n\nI love when a restaurant brings actual sample steaks by the table to demonstrate the different marbling in the various cuts of meat. Each one of them looked phenomenal, but I picked the American Wagyu 8-ounce eye, wrapped with Mangalista pork. I also got it topped with bearnaise for good luck. The steaks come a la carte, so we added the Demi Roasted Bone Marrow and the Mac & Cheese to our meats.\n\nThe bone marrow was buttery and was a great addition to the meal. I absolutely loved the demi glace. The mac and cheese was even better. The combination of blue, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses was amazing enough already, and the truffle added another dimension entirely. I also enjojyed the English peas mixed in.\n\nUnfortunately, we forgot to leave room for dessert. Oh well, something to look forward to next time."

Service was phenomenal (staff was well-trained and knowledgable of the different cuts; if you need help deciding, they are more than happy to provide recommendations!) and the restaurant had a really trendy, modern vibe.\n\nIt's clear that every detail in here was meticulously placed to serve the ultimate Gordon Ramsay experience -- from the symbolically significant light fixture that hangs above the room, to the \"Tube\" entryway that takes one from Paris to London. The restaurant is a celebration of Ramsay's culinary success, paying homage to some of his signature dishes. Any Ramsay fan will appreciate this one-of-a-kind dining experience."

The mushrooms were a bit chewy but the cream sauce, heirloom tomatoes, and Iberico ham were delicious. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Beef Wellington (which takes 45 minutes to prepare) and I ordered the American Rib Cap. My streak was very flavorful, but I've never tried wagyu/kobe beef before and I was expecting it to be more tender than it actually was. I tried the Beef Wellington, however, which was amazing and worth the wait. \n\nWe ordered the Potato Pur\u00e9e and Mac and Cheese sides.  The potatoes were unbelievably creamy and the mac and cheese with truffle, blue cheese and green peas was out of this world. \n\nWe went against our server's recommendation of the Sticky Toffee Pudding and chose the Coconut Cake. I don't remember the exact name on the menu, but it came with fresh shaved pineapple and a scoop of absolutely divine guava sorbet. \n\nOverall, this was an excellent dining experience.

I am not just saying this because I am a fan of some TV show. From the bread to the dessert, this dinner was amazing. First of all, the place is stylish and modern, the bar staff is dressed in classic blue shirts with french cuffs and red ties. The waitresses wear black dresses and were all very helpful and friendly. The music is lively but allows for conversation. The bread plate had three types of bread, an olive oil laced soft italian slice, a roll with pancetta and another roll with figs and something else delicious. My friend said the pork belly melted in his mouth and my shrimp were fresh and plump. The bone in rib eye was cooked perfectly and had a delicious char. The peppercorn sauce on the side came in a little pot and highlighted the flavors of the steak and did not overpower it.  My friend had the cafe de paris butter and said it was \"lovely\". The side dishes also complemented the steak but were delicious on their own. We had the spinach with cheese and parmesan cream, the fire roasted corn and the colcannon croquettes. After all that, I did not think I could have dessert, however, I was persuaded by my friend who wanted to try a couple of things. Michelle suggested we have the sticky toffee pudding but my friend chose two other items. After an amazing encounter with lemon tea cakes with tea infused ice cream and some spotted dick (don't laugh!) with cardamom infused ice cream, my friend declared that he had just had the best ice cream ever. Just then, the General Manager (Jean Philippe) refused to let us leave without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding. We were too full to eat but was so insistent and kind enough to bring it out. We dove in. First of all, I am not a dessert person. HOWEVER, I nearly stabbed my friend's hand to get to the last spoonful! ALSO, the formerly two best ice creams we had ever had moments earlier were TOPPED by the BUTTER ice cream which accompanied the pudding. I cannot wait to get back to Vegas to visit Gordon Ramsay's Steak. I may have to move there! Thanks to Jean Philippe and Michelle and thanks to Gordon Ramsay and Chef de Cuisine, Kevin Hee!"

The potatoes were good but the okra had tomatoes with it or some sort of tomato sauce which I didn't care for and it took my by surprise. We shared a peanut butter something for dessert which was really good. I left feeling incredibly full and felt sorry for the people trying the chefs tasting menu who seemed to be on their 10th course! I've done the chefs tasting menu at craftsteak before at MGM and had a beef hangover for days. \n\nHere's my complaint - the meat was too heavily saut\u00e9ed and sauced. You shouldn't have to cover up such a great cut of meat with stuff like marinade and sauce. It was too heavy and didn't sit well with me. I ended up throwing up a $400 meal 12 hours later."

The heirloom tomato \"salad\" was a pretentious combination of abstract ingredients that lacked harmony. The asparagus side dish was horribly selected, horribly prepared, and horribly seasoned. The asparagus was stringy, suggesting that it started as poor quality; it wasn't snapped from the stalk, so half of the dish was tough and inedible; and it had a nauseating sauce that only got worse as the dish went from luke warm to room temperature. The rib cap steak was undercooked twice (ordered medium well, received medium rare and was then re-fired to medium). The beef wellington (of which I only ate the small half) had such little character that I wondered why this was such a popular dish (except that I've had it prepared amazingly at another restaurant). The wellington was colder than room temperature, served over a cold pur\u00e9e and a demi-glaze that was as thick as a caramel chew and wouldn't separate from the plate. Apart from the service, the only other redeeming factor I could find was the wine selection. Oh, and the silverware (especially the knives) might look cute in a picture, but they're functionally impotent while at rest on the plate. This place is all bark and no bite.

Wish we hadn't  ordered that. However, Gordon Ramsay's famous Wellington lives up to it's expectations. The hype is real !"

            "review": "I will start by saying we were there on their second open week, which was a while ago. But our immediate impression was that the music was too loud, making conversation difficult (hopefully they have fixed this by now). The restaurant excelled at presentation, starting with the iPad wine and drinks menu, and the steak cart having each cut of steak on its own pedestal with small mirrors to show each steak from multiple angles. I would have liked more light though, it was hard to appreciate the marbling of prime and American Kobe beef.  \n\nI started with the fantastic short rib tortellini, and for our entre\u00e9s we decided not to get steak, instead ordering from Ramsay's Signature menu. My wife was excited to finally have his Beef Wellington, and I went for the roasted chicken breast with foie gras wild rice and tikka masala. Dessert was the sticky toffee pudding with super-frozen ice cream made to look like pats of butter on top. This was \"OMG good\". \n\nThe great presentation finished with the french press coffee. Each order comes with its own (approx 12 ounce) press pot, with the \"ABC Spoons\". These were spoons dipped in chocolates, filled with Amaretto, Baileys, and Chambord. The french press needed to be ground a little coarser and I passed this along to the waiter for future notice, but I don't mind a touch of grit in my coffee."

We were a little early for our reservation and planned to wait at the bar but ended up being seated right away.  I expected to get stuck at a small table in a corner somewhere and was ecstatic when we got a prime booth with a view of the kitchen.  I love to watch the kitchen.  We started with a strawberry martini and a cider.  Service was perfect the whole night.  Our server was always there when we needed him but we never felt rushed.  None of the appetizers stood out to us so we went straight to the main course.  We ordered bone in rib eye, fish and chips, crab legs, mac and cheese and twice baked potato. Everything was excellent.  Even though we were stuffed we couldn't leave without dessert.  We ordered sticky toffee pudding and coconut cake.  Both were delicious.  We love sticky toffee pudding and this was one of the best we have had.  The coconut cake was light and refreshing.  Definitely a perfect end to the meal."

            "review": "For a while now, I have been craving a fine dining experience like non other. The kind of fine dining experience that drew me to this industry when I was 7 years old. The kind of place where you're not allowed to enter if you are dressed casually and a reservation is definitely required. I wanted to not just eat, but DINE at the kind of place where the waiter knew what side to pour my beverage, and wouldn't dare \"stack\" my plates. I don't know WHY I thought this would be close to it. \n\nI'm not going to talk about the food so much because there are plenty of reviews here highlighting that. I want to focus on the ambiance and dining experience. \n\nWhen I arrived for my 4:30pm reservation I was surprised at how many people were actually in the restaurant at the time of opening. The hostesses were friendly and gave me a quick tour of the establishment. I couldn't hear anything she was saying because of the blaring loud music and loud chatter. Quickly I realized that I had gotten my hopes up. With so much noise like traffic, media, slot machines, and music I wanted to hear nothing but elevator music, and light chatter amongst the guest. Ohhhh, how opposite it was!\nI decided to dine alone this evening because although I love eating all types of food, I wanted to dine somewhere tonight without boyfriends/friends complaining about portion sizes or prices. When dining alone, servers usually try and seat you at a bar or cramped in between parties. They sat me near a table of four who seemed to be looking at the menu in frustration. Within minutes they each got up and left. LOL...\n\nAfter resetting the table they sat four male diners next to me. They were talking about Gordon Ramsey's background in a foreign language so loud I couldn't hear myself think! I didn't really fault them because I wouldn't be surprised if they couldn't hear each other over the loud music. Rather than ruin my own night, I politely asked to be moved to the very opposite side of them. They could chat it up to their hearts content I could dine in solace. Everyone happy!\n\nMy server was this good looking guy with a Dapper Dan slicked hairstyle and a side part. I was disappointed in his service. I don't like when someone doesn't make eye contact when you speak to him or her, and although he wasn't rude, he just wasn't in the moment. I've received better service from Denny's and I expected GR to be just as passionate about front of the house operations as his food. \n\nTHE FOOD. Yes, I enjoyed every bite of the signature Roasted Beef Wellington that could have used a ladle more sauce, and the heavenly Mac and Cheese that was thankfully saturated in truffle flavor. I managed to make it half way through my sticky toffee pudding before my stomach put on boxing gloves and said---\"YOU WANT A PIECE A ME?!\" So I decided my Mac and Cheese and dessert needed a to go container. \n\nMy server brought the check and not surprisingly he chose that particular time to make eye contact, smile and be engaging. I asked him what the delicious flavor was on the six pieces of glazed vegetables that accompanied the Beef Wellington. He didn't seem to understand so I rephrased it and he said, \"OH...Parsnip.\" I didn't want to press the issue anymore because I realized he didn't know, but this is what I mean. An awesome server will be honest and say they don't know and will go in the kitchen and ask! In 2015, the average diner has a vast culinary knowledge and you can't underestimate them like the food industry did in the 1980's. I know a parsnip is a type of root vegetable, but there was obviously a glaze and herb seasoning that complimented it. Sighhhhh. I still gave him a very good tip. He probably was banking on his good looks instead of his brain to get tips, but he's lucky I acknowledge he must make a living as well.\nMaybe it's a generational thing where fine dining is a lost art. Perhaps people feel fine dining has a way of segregating and dividing amongst the \"classes\". Establishments now want the money of as many as they can get--EVEN if it means you show up in flip-flops.\n\nAside from the loud club like music, acceptable underdressed attire, and non-engaging servers, I managed to befriend 4 people at two different tables. I even passed my Mac and Cheese over so they could try it. Why not? I might as well keep the trend going. \nThey even invited me to get some drinks with them. I passed and continued my solo date night with a comedy show. \n\nOverall, GR is worth returning---for the food of course!"

            "review": "First off I love GR but I was little let down with my experience at his Steak restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice. Contemporary, edgy and clean. The wait staff is very professional and look great. Their presentation is fantastic (meat cut carts) and the explanation of what to order and what you ordered is on par with other high end restaurants. That's where my great experience ended though. \n\nI ordered at bone-in New York strip, medium. The result was a fatty piece that was cooked medium well. In my opinion, theres nothing worse than leaving a premium steak uneaten on my plate. Pretty bummed. (-1 star)\n\nWe ordered salads and some sides with dinner. The salads were pretty standard and the sides: Mac n cheese, potato niblets and deep fried asparagus. Mac n cheese (5/10), potato niblets (7/10), asparagus (9/10). Other than the asparagus, the sides were nothing special. \n\nSo my biggest gripe is when we were charged for water. They asked us at the beginning of dinner, \"Sparkling water or still water?\" Of course we always go with the standard free water, so we said \"still please.\" All throughout the 3 hour dinner service they poured our water from these fancy red bottles. Well, we ended up paying  fancy. The check said $20 for water?!?!  (-1 Star) Ridiculous. When we asked the waiter, he did admit that this was something of a issue with other past patrons. He said that they would take it off our bill if he didn't charge it already.  He offered to but to return the charge but it would take a month in processing. We let it go and now I'm writing a non-favorable review on yelp.\n\nSummary: If you decide to eat here, open up the pocket book because its expensive. And when presented with your two options for water go with the third option and ask for the \"Tap\" water."

We did, unfortunately there was no place to either sit or stand so we had to exit back to the casino area to wait. We were seated after a few minutes but our hostess was too far in front of us to hear the spiel she was giving on the entryway and lights. \n\nI was hopeful the experience would improve, however we were seated beside a table of 4 that shared a banquet with our table. Unfortunately one of the diners at that table seemed very intoxicated and was seated so that 3 of their party were on the banquet instead of using the chair. His constant movement made my guest feel like she was in a bouncy castle. The staff did nothing to address this very obvious obnoxious behaviour and continued to serve rounds of shots to them. The restaurant is also very loud making conversation with your own table difficult.\n\nWe ordered apps -- the British ale onion soup and beet salad. Both were excellent as was the warm bread selection. \n\nOur mains came out surprisingly quickly given the proviso on the menu that the Wellington would take 45 mins. I ordered the filet which was cooked a melt-in-your-mouth mid rare. I also had the loaded baked potato with bechamel. It was fine, but nothing special. My guest had the Wellington which she said was very good , unfortunately the potato pur\u00e9e was ice cold. She informed our waiter who promptly brought a new pot of the pur\u00e9e which was piping hot and delicious. \n\nOverall the food was good, but hard to really enjoy in the disappointing ambiance."

Cooked perfectly in my opinion. I don't like overly seasoned steak. I feel that if it's cooked right, the taste of the meat shouldn't be covered in sauces and seasoning. The couple of potato and carrot pieces that came with the plate were firmer than I'd had before. I didn't think I'd like that, but it was a pleasant surprise. I got the mushrooms on the side, which were a bit of a disappointment to me. I don't know if it was the mushrooms themselves, or the sauce used to cook them in, but something tasted both too earthy and fishy at the same time. Weird description, I know. I'm sorry, I don't know how else to describe them.\n\nThey provided me with a plate of a variety of little breads to try. The one with bacon was my favorite, of course!\n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience. Went on a Tuesday evening, no reservations, so I sat in the bar/lounge area. Totally fine with this, as it was nearly empty, and I liked being pretty much alone. As people started flowing in, I was on my way out. Perfect! The only thing I didn't like, was that the music was so darn loud in there. I'm getting old. Loud music belongs in a handful of places: clubs, concerts, parties. Not restaurants or mall shops. Maybe I'm just an old grump. I have no idea if the dining room area is a little quieter. Hope so, or I don't know how you'd hear your date. But then, if you don't want to...\n\nService was excellent.

I honestly was planning on just doing In n Out and throwing away a few dollars at the casino in preparation for tomorrow's meetings, but the boss man insisted we do Vegas right starting from the moment we landed! Who was I to argue? \n\nIn Vegas, the word \"sensual\" can describe just about everything. The entrance is guarded by 5 hostesses who seem like they're just there to look pretty...and they're doing a damn good job! It almost seems like a space ship entryway, because they're all wearing a very \"sensual\" opaque outfit that gives them this enticing sheen. Probably by design, they say they need 15 minutes to prepare your table, so they walk you to the bar. Then one of the hostesses comes by and gets you. In Vegas, everything is made so that you spend money comfortably. They tell you it's no big deal to transfer your tab to your table. Don't sweat it! \n\nSo there's this guy, Gordon Ramsay, who prances around television telling every chef that they suck, how he has Michelin stars, and they should find another career, unless they win one of his contests, in which case, he finds them worthy to run a restaurant under his name. So, for a guy with a big ego, there's a lot of hype riding on this meal, which is my first Gordon Ramsay place ever.\n\nKUROBOTA PORK BELLY\nBasically 5 cube pieces of pork belly served on a dish with a dollop of grits and other stuff. The pork belly is incredible, in fact, it's perfect! There is a perfect amount of char on the top layer to give it a delicate crisp. Meanwhile, there is such a great sweet but deep flavor in the bite size piece that has all the characters of a great pork flavor, but also with just enough fat to give it almost a spongy and super tender texture. There're a couple different sauces smeared on the plate, and I honestly don't remember what they tasted like, but the pork belly stole the show anyway.\n\nBONE IN RIBEYE\nSo Gordon, nice appetizer. But let's talk main course! I haven't had a lot of Kurobota pork belly before, but I have a large repertoire of premium steaks to compare against. Can you hang?\n\nThe steak had a very clean presentation. Nice char - the kind that looks like freshly cooled molten rock, with small ditches where the marbling (fat) didn't char. It's a great looking char, but with the first jab of the fork and slice of the knife, I'm missing the suspenseful sound of crispy char. Little disappointing, but let's eat! First bite, I find that there was in fact a little bit of char there, but not enough to really lend any flavors. Good marks for technical quality - medium rare was spot on. It was moist and juicy. The steak was tender, but not nearly as tender as a 40 or 55 day dry aged David Burke's steak (Ramsay only does 28), but the Achilles heel was the seasoning. This seems to be the problem with all Vegas steaks I've tried, from SW to Carnevino to Ramsay's, they all have the same problem. They're about 80% of the way to being an eclectic steak, but it's always that hurdle. So, unfortunately, we have a tie with all the other Vegas steaks...which I consider to be less than Morton's.\n\nHARICOT VERT\nThat's ok Gordon, there's still the sides! I had no idea what this was, but it turns out it's French for what we call green beans/string beans. Basically, they're green beans in a tempura batter, fried. But when you have them, it's so much more! The tempura is absolutely perfect! It's so crispy, and maintains that crispness for a long time! The beans are still tough enough to snap when you bite, but they're not crunchy raw. And the seasoning is just so right on! They come with a garlic aioli to dip, but you don't even need it! It's as if each piece was seasoned and personally inspected. I can't get enough of these! \n\nSTICKY TOFFEE PUDDING\nBefore he could finish his sentence asking about dessert, I (since I researched on Yelp) ordered this. It's pretty amazing. It's buttery and super rich! There's no crunchy toffee, but it's all sort of baked in. Just read the description, daydream about it, and that's exactly how it tastes! Texture is like a warm tres leches cake. Delicious, but a couple bites were a little too sweet.\n\n\n\"THE BEEF IS SO RAW IT'S STARTING TO EAT THE F***ING SALAD!\"\nHad to use a GR meme! No the beef was not raw, it was cooked perfectly medium rare. Well, I guess there're a lot of creative things you can do to green beans, pork belly, and things like that. But a steak...there's not a lot of room for creativity; at least not without transforming it from a Steak to a \"Beef Dish.\" Sorry to say, main course was completely outdone by its appetizers & sides. I bet non-steak entrees are delicious! Too bad the restaurant is called \"Steak.\""

Our steaks were all cooked the way they should be at a steakhouse and were on point. One of the bone in strips had some membrane that should have been trimmed off before cooking; especially when charging $63.  The sticky toffee pudding and other desserts were all excellent.

Sadly, was disappointed and won't be returning here.\n\nTried to get reservations about a week in advance, but all they had was 10PM or later.  Considering we sometimes can be passed out in bed at that time in Vegas (depending on how the day drinking goes), we decided to risk it and opt to see if we could get a table in the lounge right at the opening time.  Well, it worked!!  We were able to get in right around 6PM when we walked up and needed a table for 4.  \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice.  Great decor and the tables had this cool light on them.  Waitresses wear these sexy sequined short dresses, which made for good conversation and eye candy for the men.  I ordered a blueberry vodka and club soda, which was delicious.  The other 3 in my party didn't order anything to drink (husband was already drunk and the other couple don't really drink much).  However, looked like they had a great wine selection and they give it to you on an ipad, which was cool.\n\nAs for what we ordered....my husband and the other guy with us both ordered the kobe steak, I ordered the salmon, my friend ordered the seafood platter.  For starters, I got the salad and one other person got the shrimp cocktail.  They were both fine.  Nothing to rave about and not disappointed there, really.  \n\nThen the food came out.  So my salmon was barely lukewarm in the center and had NO flavor whatsoever.  I ordered mushrooms on the side and they were \"ok\".  My husband's kobe steak (which was $80, I do believe!!) was \"ok\".  It was rarer than \"medium\" which was how he ordered it, but didn't want to send it back given the crowd and how long it might take.  It was good (I tried it), so don't get me wrong.  But I've had better steaks that were 1/2 the price.  He ordered the mashed potatotes on the side which were really delicious!  Go for it!  I would say the salmon was on the list of bottom 10 salmon dishes I have ever tried.  Maybe it was an \"off\" night or something for that dish.  I know they are known for the steaks, but....  Also, I don't even think the waitress ever came back and asked how the food tasted, or we might have told her some of this feedback.  Maybe she didn't ask because she knew.  haha\n\nThe total bill was $425 for 4 of us (I had one cocktail and nobody else drank, so this was truly all food..no dessert for anyone either!)  Very pricey for \"so so\" food, in my opinion.  We have a chain restaurant called \"Firebirds\" here that I would go to everyday for steak and/or salmon before I went to Gordon Ramsay's.  Even if they were the same price I'd still choose Firebirds.\n\nHopefully Gordon goes to his restaurant and experiences the place like we did. Then he'll yell at the chef and things will change for the better.  :-)"

It was expensive but a delicious meal.\n\nHowever, I didn't enjoy it quite as much the second time around.

Had the sliders. Wow. So much flavor. Tender, juicy, flavorful... best ever! Steaks were amazing, tender but with real flavor. Fingerling potato were like an unbelievable an explosion of flavor. Truffle + Potato = awesome! Coffee with liquor spoons are so fun and cool. Very unique and delicious. Sticky toffee pudding (piping hot date cake with caramel sauce and brown butter ice cream) is one of the best you will ever try. I've been to England many times and never had anything this good. \n\nSERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING. \n\nI have been twice. At the bar Amanda was really amazing. Very sweet and engaging but professional as the same time. Her steps of service, timing, table maintenance was impeccable. Best I have ever had at a bar. Manager stopped by (Mike?) was super cool. Totally knew his stuff and was professional, personal an friendly. Perfect Manager. \n\nThe second visit Abraham was our server. Probably the best server that has ever waited on me. He had a extremely warm, friendly and cool attitude and seemed sincerely interested in my experience. His knowledge and descriptions of the food made my mouth water and were A+++. His recommendations were perfect, each one lined up with what we would have wanted. The timing was perfect, table maintenance was perfect. Level of engagement was spot on. \n\nIn my opinion this restaurant really adds some foundation to the celebrity name of Gordon Ramsay and his shows. He is not just a talker but knows how to set a place up to execute a  perfect dining experience. \n\nIf you're in Vegas this place is a must!"

This restaurant  is truly deserving of five stars.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came in this past Saturday and was welcomed by a very friendly staff.  We had made reservations, so there was only a short wait while the host checked to see if our table was ready. After my boyfriend took a smoke break, the girl led us into the restaurant and welcomed us to London and described the meaning behind the red chandelier/art piece that was hanging on the ceiling. She then let us know that our booth was on the upper floor and gave us the option of the stairs or elevator. We said we didn't mind either one and she led us up the short staircase.\n\nShe seated us and left. We were immediately greeted by Muuhamaduu(spelling?) and offered drinks. After he left, Tony came and introduced himself letting us know he'd be back to explain the meats.  He was thorough and answered any questions we had.  He kept a smile on his face the whole time, which I found to be very warm and welcoming. After Tony's presentation, we settled on the mac n cheese, beef Wellington, and the rib cap for my boyfriend. \n\nThe food came out quickly.  My boyfriend had taken a smoke break (again) during this time, and the servers and waiters were very friendly and joked that they would finish his dinner if he didn't come back in time.\n\nThe mac n cheese was the most delicious mac n cheese I've ever eaten. My boyfriend said it didn't beat his favorite boxed velveeta, but he still finished it off. The beef Wellington and rib cap was also amazing.  There is no words to describe how delicious it was. What surprised me was the few pieces of vegetables that were served with the beef Wellington. I hate carrots, my boyfriend loves carrots, and some how, this was the best piece of carrot either of us had ever eaten.\n\nWe finished off our meal by ordering the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Muuhammaduu guessed what I wanted before I ordered and said it was one of the best things there. It was actually one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Get it. It's amazing. Boyfriend agreed and was scraping the bottom of the plate when we were done.\n\nDuring our meal Tony and Muuhammaduu were very attentive and friendly.  They talked to us and asked how things were, offered suggestions, and even chit chatted with us.  They were awesome and I would love to work with them again.  Thanks guys for the great night!"

They all act as if they don't want to be there and seems there is nothing but air in their heads. \n\nTheir \"tunnel\" that you walk through that connects France to England is so silly, especially the way the hostess explained it to us. \n\nThe five of us were seated upstairs with a view of the casino below. The servers were very nice and informative. Our server brought out the cart with all of the cuts of beef to view. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered the HK Antioxidant. This is a pretty sour and fruity drink that basically tasted like cranberry juice to me. My bf ordered the Sidecar which was a lot better so I ordered this drink for myself as well. \n\nI had to order the Beef Wellington as this is supposed to be Gordon Ramsay's signature dish. I also got a side of foie gras on the side. Let me tell you though, I wasn't impressed with what I ordered. The beef Wellington didn't have much flavor and wasn't as juicy as I thought it would be. The foie gras tasted like it was just thrown on the grill. Very plain tasting.\n\nI tried my bf's American Kobe Filet and it was juicy and flavorful. A lot better than the Beef Wellington. \n\nEven though I wasn't too satisfied with my meal, you better believe that I ate everything on my plate! I had to get our money's worth."

Our server team (Dennis and Rodney) provided possibly the best service we've ever had in a place we weren't known. \n\nOn our last visit we were seated on the main floor, and although the meal and service were fantastic then too, it was a bit loud and busy. As a veteran, it's hard for me to relax in that setting, so I requested seating in the balcony when I made our reservation. The hostess had gotten my request, and we were led to a balcony booth with no discussion or reminders. Dennis introduced himself and his casual humor was a great beginning to the evening. A simple word that that we were \"dining\", not just eating, was enough for Dennis to pace our meal perfectly. Knowing how good the food was, we couldn't help over-ordering, but everything was delicious. When we wanted a less expensive bottle of wine from the one we'd ordered previously, the sommelier quickly made a superb suggestion, and we were quite happy with the result. The steaks were...of course...excellent, and the sides were tasty. Of course, we had to end with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which is one of the best dessert dishes I've ever had. \n\nOverall, a wonderful evening with our family, with friendly, attentive staff and great food. We'll definitely be back, next trip to Vegas!"

Excellent food and outstanding service made the meal well worth it.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated immediately at the first two top table at the top of the far stairwell. If we could change one thing, it would be to request a booth. The table was small and we often found ourselves clearing plates and space with every course. The table was also very close to the exit of the elevator, the top of the stairs, and the exit from the kitchen. This led to very heavy traffic near our table.\n\nOther than the table, the meal was perfect. Service from Dennis and John did not miss a beat all night. Many of the items we ate and drank were recommendations from Dennis and he did not steer us wrong. We started with The Drifter, a glass of moscato, bread, and the shellfish platter. Everything on the platter was delicious. The enormous prawns stood out the most.\n\nFor entrees I had the rib cap and my wife had the fish and chips with sauteed spinach, potato puree, and mac and cheese as our sides. If they were in a lineup, I will always choose the wagyu cow over his angus friends. I'll sacrifice a larger cut of meat for a smaller, tastier cut of wagyu. My rib cap was delicious with no sauce required. I had to cut my steak into smaller bites so I could savor each piece and to keep me from wolfing it down like I normally do.\n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter bar and the sticky toffee pudding. The sticky toffee pudding is all that it is hyped to be.\n\nOn deck for next visit will be the beef wellington, bone marrow, seared foie gras, and a repeat of the sticky toffee."

It was perfectly cooked and (this may be cliche) but it melts in your mouth. \n\nFor the main course I order the rib eye cap, medium rare of course. It was cooked to perfection, however at $65 for 8oz it was not a great deal. It was right up there with the best steaks I've had, but it didn't blow them away. My friend and I shared two sides, the Mac n cheese and the roasted potatoes. The potatoes were nothing to write home about. The Mac n cheese on the other hand was quite delicious. I highly recommend this especially if you only get one side. \n\nThe service was good, but they seemed irritated that we didn't order drinks. I also didn't like that they charged $6 for a Diet Coke.

The small details make a difference, like adding salt to the butter for the breads. Ordered the beef Wellington: cooked perfectly. Not my favorite dish (a simple matter of preference, not the biggest puff pastry fan) but it was delicious. Mushrooms were divine. Scallops were truly cooked to absolute perfection! Wish I ordered more than two. Toffee dessert was great, and huge. In my opinion it just needed a little more ice cream to make it a perfect ratio. Also had the Panna cotta which was not only visually appealing and unique but also tasty. Their corkage is odd: they only let you bring in a bottle of wine if it's not on their wine list. If it's not, it's a $50 corkage fee. Unfortunately ours was on the list (champagne) so we were unable to open the bottle. There were three of us- we would have split the bottle as a toast and ordered actual cocktails from the restaurant, so they lost out on beverage revenue in my opinion. Overall- a great experience. 4 stars out of 5 because no dish completely blew my mind, but this is a fantastic restaurant and I highly recommend visiting!! You won't regret it!"

When we arrived for dinner we were informed that their main dining room was sold out but the bar area was available and first-come, first-serve. We found a cozy table in the bar area and were introduced to our server. So, a note on the server... she works at a GR restaurant but I don't think she is even qualified to babysit my children. Not only did the drink order come out wrong... three times, when we asked her for clean cutlery she was confused because she had never heard that word before. WTH?? The food was all very tasty - we had the beef carpaccio and Caesar salad to start. Both had great flavor and were plated nicely. We also had the Sea Bass. When we asked the server how big the sea bass was (for a $47 alacarte portion) she proceeded to hold out her hands to show us the size of the fish... seriously? She didnt know the weight of the fish. She was not properly trained to be a server in this type of establishment where dinner (mind you, we split everything, so 1 starter, 1 salad and 1 entree and drinks) was $150+. The table remained dirty and the plates looked worn. Maybe our service was terrible due to the fact we were in the bar area, but IMO still unacceptable."

I went here with my family and was so excited to try the Hell's Kitchen menu, unfortunately, I was not allowed to due to the fact that the rest of my family was not interested in having the same course meal as I was having. I asked if any exception could be made as it was my first visit and was planning for months about it, but alas, managements rules are that the customer is not always right... \n\nNow my father in particular is a huge fan of beef wellingtons, and after I built up his expectations of it being Chef Ramsay's signature dish, was very much looking forward to having it, he is Not however a fan of any meat cooked less than charred  well done, not my fancy and certainly not Chef Ramsay's, but it is my fathers, and as a paying customer is allowed to get his meal prepared the exact way he wants.... Just not here at Gordon Ramsay Steak... He was flat out refused to be served the Beef Wellington anything but Medium Rare. I was flat out shocked, that kind of thing could occur at such a restaurant, especially considering Chef Ramsay's so called customer standards. \n\nAgain food was amazing but the experience was tarnished by poor customer satisfaction policies... Could we have had food just as tasty at a fraction of the price, definitely. But this wasn't about price, it was about the notoriety and the experience, and I personally feel that my experience was not as enjoyable as it truly could have been..."

All come to mind. \n\nThe wait staff is amazing and friendly as well as attentive. Our waiter was fine. Like super hot. And super nice. I almost wanted to ask him to have my babies. \n\nChristina is gorgeous (winner of Hell's Kitchen) and was working the line. She looked dedicated to her job and it was amazing watching her work. \n\nFirst off, the bread beforehand is already great. If that was any indication of where the food was going, we were super excited. \n\nMy date and I ordered the beef wellington for 2 and IT LIVES UP TO ITS HYPE. We both moaned non-stop as we ate. Only downfall is that the pastry puff kept falling off but otherwise, I tore into that dish. I cleaned my plate so well, everyone was shocked. \n\nMy parents ordered the rib-eye that was made to perfection.  They couldn't stop raving about it. My mom ate her whole rib eye even though she wasn't even hungry because she just couldn't stop. Then she asked me if she could have half my dish!!! I told her to back off. Hah. \n\nWe also had a side of the mac & cheese. The cheese extremely strong and slightly smelly but oh so good. \n\nIf you're hitting up Vegas, GO! I'm telling you now to GO! My mom actually said this was the best steak she ever had and she didn't even want to go at first!!! \n\nThey also have a Hell's Kitchen menu that includes Scottish Egg, Scallops w. Risotto, a Beet Salad dish, Beef Wellington and for dessert, a Toffee type dessert.\n\nFYI you can get the Scottish Egg and Toffee dessert at GR's Pub & Grill at Caesar's so you don't have to stick to the HK $145 per person (and the WHOLE table has to do the HK menu if you're doing that) menu! \n\nENJOY!"

            "review": "First, the plus side:  A great (really great) Beef Wellington.  Can't say enough about the quality of the product and execution on this dish.  Good enough to cause me to return even though our overall experience with the restaurant was lackluster.\n\nNow for my issues.  Mind you, we had a party of 7 and went here on the heals of having gone to Mastro's the night before, but had great expectations based on the pics and reviews of others.\n\nIssues:\n\n#1 - Misleading server.  The waiter went on and on as to how the other items on the menu were far better than their signature dish.  I was challenged as to how a baked steak could be better than one that was grilled, and replied that the best steak I've ever had was baked, not grilled.  He scoffed, and ended up talking everyone at the table (other than myself) out of ordering the Wellington.  I have to assume this was based on the restaurant's/kitchen's desire to minimize orders for that dish since it's labor intensive and time consuming.  Regardless of the reason, based on the result and the fact that it was far superior to every other dish provided, it was a major disappointment that a server could be so deceiving.\n\n#2 - Poor seating.  Being seated in a section in clear sight (and sound) of the busy 2nd floor sub-kitchen door.  Asked to be seated at a different table, and the only option (at 5:15pm!) was an adjacent table with the same proximity.  \n\n#3 - No water.  Throughout the night (2 1/2 hours) we had to ask for water refills a minimum of 5 times.  Their attention to their guests was totally invisible, and made the staff at Mastro's the night before look like all-stars  Literally asked to have the wait staff leave the refill bottle on the table because they so rarely refilled the overwhelmingly undersized water glasses (5 oz?) and they refused.  Instead, they came around sparingly as my guests waited with empty glasses throughout their meal.  Shameful.\n\nI don't mind spending money on a quality meal, and understand that eating in Las Vegas on the strip can be a bit of a cattle-call, but I've had far better experiences at many other strip restaurants.  I wasn't expecting Joel Robuchon, but was hoping for better, not worse, than Mastro's.  Oh well.\n\nLast note - Sticky Toffee desert.  Way over-hyped.  Could have split 1 among the 7 in attendance, it was overly rich and sweet.  One of the guests ordered a tart Tartin, it was far superior.  Coffee service was also lackluster, over promised and under delivered."

The bar area was seat yourself and we were lucky enough to get a table!\nThat being said, the hustle and bustle of the bar wasn't the greatest of service. Our waitress couldn't describe the temperature of a medium rare steak. Which was a bit jarring.. seeing as this is Gordon Ramsay's Steak!\n\nAs far as the food goes, no complaints.\nI got the Beef Wellington and it was SO SO SO good. Definitely worth the wait. Decadent and rich. \nMy boyfriend got the skirt steak which was cooked very nicely.\n\nDefinitely would wait to get a table inside next time, but I was so excited to be in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant that it all worked out."

            "review": "This was my first time dining at one of Gordon's 28 Restaurants. It was getting close to Bedtime and I was still kinda Hungry (the portions at Koi were really small) so I decided to come here for a Late Night Bite after seeing that spectacular Volcanic Eruption at The Mirage. \nIts so cool that Gordon's Face is on the Arc de Triomphe outside. After looking at that for 5 Minutes I walked into the Paris went to the Left and found the Restaurant inside of a Tunnel, I came in about 35 Minutes before Closing I sat at the Bar, it was hard for me to Choose something but a little over 5 Minutes of Examining the Menu I decided what I wanted: I was going to get the Beef Wellington, but they said it would take 45 Minutes to make, so in the Meantime I decided to order some other dishes. \nFor my Appetizer I got the English Chowder with Scallops, Smoked Haddock, Fingerling Potato Medallions and Citrus Pearls (Rich Creamy Broth, Perfectly Seared Scallop, Smokiness from the Haddock, Texture from the Potatoes and those Citrus Pearls bursting with Acidity with each bite you take). I asked if I could sample some of the Crispy Jamon Iberico (Spanish Ham) that they use for their Gnocchi Appetizer (and it was Crispy and Smoky). \n\nI also Decided to Order a Cocktail I got the Red Lion (Tangueray Gin, Grand Marnier, Lemon Juice and Orange Bitters, garnished with a Swirling Orange Peel (A very Strong drink so I had to take Sips, I think they call it the Red Lion cuz its very Ferocious on your Palate, They seemed to like that name and might consider changing it to the Ferocious Lion), They also gave me a Plate of Assorted Breads while waiting for my Entr\u00e9e: Lemon-Thyme Focaccia, 2 Different Brioche Breads 1. Pancetta & Fig and the other Mushroom & Truffle and some Walnut & Stilton Blue Cheese Baguettes and on the side a little Circle of Sheep's Milk Butter topped with Volcanic Sea Salt (The Mushroom & Truffle Brioche was my favorite of the bunch). \n\nThen the Beef Wellington came out (In case your Wondering what Beef Wellington is, its Filet Mignon seared coated with Mustard wrapped in Prosciutto then coated with Duxelle or Puree of Mushrooms, they say they use Chanterelle and Black Trumpets for their Duxelle and then they wrap it up in Puff Pastry) it was Beautiful, Served Medium Rare with a Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Roasted Root Vegetables (they had a good amount of Bite) and a Red Wine Demi-Glace (Meat was Melt in your Mouth, Earthiness from the Duxelle, Smooth Potato Puree and Flakiness from the Puff Pastry) and to finish off the Meal I ordered Gordon's Best Selling dessert, The Sticky Toffee Pudding (Sweet Pudding Cake with a Brown Sugar Toffee Sauce and Brown Butter Ice Cream) The first time that I saw this dessert was in the Middle of the 4th Season of MasterChef when Gordon was gonna make that Dessert for the Wedding and since then I've been dying to try it. \n\n(It was awesome, the Cake just Melts in your Mouth, The Ice cream was Sick (in a Good Way) although the Shape was different in the Episode that Gordon presented it was shaped like a Quenelle but when I got it it looked like a stick of Butter (Hence the Name) and when your pour that Sticky Toffee Sauce all over it (its Heaven). \n\nMy bill came out to $110, This was the most Expensive Meal that I've ever Paid for so far in my 22 Years of Living, Mostly because that Beef Wellington (a $56 dish) your probably thinking (Have I lost my Mind) and I'd say no its worth every penny, Oscar, Bobby and Liz were all very Nice but its a shame that Gordon wasn't there nor was Christina (Christina Wilson the Season 10 Winner of Hell's Kitchen who won the position). \nBut I still had an Awesome time and they were also kind enough to bag up the other half of my Beef Wellington (which I gave to my Dad), If Gordon is reading this I wonder if he'll like it or just call me a Donkey and tell me to Fuck Off, Who Knows. But I'm definitely stopping in Next Visit !!!"

            "review": "I ate at GR Steak last night and while not mind blowing, it was a VERY excellent meal. I normally dislike going to high-end steak houses because they all sort of seem the same and few surprises are to be had. I'd rather spend my money doing a tasting menu with creative plating and flavor profiles I've never experienced. But Gordon Ramsay Steak made me a very happy camper last night.\n\nThe bread choices are excellent. The pancetta brioche rolls and the one with the blue cheese were great. \n\nThe steaks are done the way steaks should be done. They had a nice crust and very flavorful. The seasoning was spot on, the fat was rendered nicely, and the flavor of the beef took your taste buds for quite an adventure.\n\nThe side dishes were typical for a steakhouse.  Mac and cheese with truffle oil and panko crumbs was as expected.  The mushrooms were great, although the bonito shavings really didn't add much in the way of flavor (guess just more umami?).  We also ordered the creamed spinach with panko.  Nothing to write home about, but all done very well.\n\nDessert was probably the best I've had at a steakhouse. The sticky toffee pudding is amazing. It's warm and moist and airy and rich, while managing to not be too sweet. The browned butter ice cream it was paired with was perfect. To offset the richness of sticky toffee pudding, we also got the watermelon sorbet panna cotta. The watermelon sorbet was refreshing and the panna cotta underneath gave the sorbet a creaminess and altered the taste to be almost like a watermelon creamsicle.\n\nOverall, this was one of the best steak house experience I've ever had. The cow was the star that night, and the staff should be proud of that.\n\nOur meal lasted over two hours and I could only find one true fault and one nitpicky one.\n\nMy ONLY true complaint of the night was the garnish of the steak. There were a few pieces of leafy greens thrown onto the steak for the sake of color (I think it was baby spinach? I didn't pay attention to them). They added nothing to the plate and had no business being there. The ones in contact with the steak were starting to wilt and we all just pushed them off to the side as we ate. It never occurred to me to eat one, but I doubt it would have paired with the beef in any way. If they want a contrasting color on that plate, make a simple pesto polenta square or something. The days of non-functional garnishes passed years ago.\n\nNow for my nitpicky complaint. The panna cotta was a bit too firm. While I think this may have been done intentionally to hold up the watermelon sorbet, it was too firm to be called a panna cotta."

I'm surprised to say it's one of the best Hefeweizens I've ever had - take that with a grain of salt as I am by no means a Hefeweizen connoisseur. \n\nOn the food front, we started off with a shrimp cocktail - they were delicious and HUGE! I then ordered the beef wellington and the meat was so tender it was like eating meat butter. They didn't provide us with full serrated steak knives but something slightly closer to a butter knife. But, that knife went through the beef like it was nothing and it was melt in your mouth tender. The potato puree was the perfect complement to the beef - pureed perfectly delicious. We finished off our meal with the sticky toffee pudding - all I have to say is that it's a must try.\n\nAll in all, it was a deliciously perfect meal. If you're in Las Vegas, this is a must try."

The staff was friendly, knowledgable, and very attentive. The bread served before the meal was tasty, and we were excited for our order to come out. However, the food was TERRIBLE! We ordered the gnocchi and pork belly to start off. The gnocchi was nothing special, pretty forgettable. The pork belly was good, probably one of the better things we ate that night. For our main courses, we ordered the beef Wellington and the fish and chips.\n\nBeef Wellington was the dish we were most excited to eat. It would end up being the most overhyped and disappointing single dish that I have ever eaten in my entire life. The pastry was soggy, and the beef was cold. I believe the meat is supposed to be marinated in mustard, but it was definitely not the case here. It was extremely bland.\n\nFish and chips was absolute gross. First off the fish was bland, mushy, and cold. Both of our entrees could've used seasoning. The chips (fries) were actually quite good. Maybe the best thing we ate that night. Unfortunately, I got food poisoning from this meal. Which is pretty telling. Also, they charged about $9 for water which is ridiculous. Especially because Nevada has the highest quality tap water in the entire nation. Seriously save your money and go somewhere else. Unless you enjoy paying premium prices for buffet quality food. In the words of Mr. Ramsay, the food here is total bollocks."

            "review": "I had high expectations for Steak as I had seen the meticulous way Gordon runs his kitchen on TV.  Overall I came away disappointed.  This sentiment started with the hostesses at the greeting station and continued throughout the meal.  \n\nThe hostesses (there were three) were not rude or impolite, but they seemed more interested in visiting with each other than attending to guests.  \n\nInside was dark, and the preponderance of red lighting combined with Union Jack painted across the ceiling gave an air of a sports bar or strip club. \n\nOnce seated we were served by a snarky waiter that, like the hostesses, seemed to simply be going through the drill rather than having sincere concern for the customer. \n  \nThe wine list was on an iPad (along with a glorifying bio of Gordon and a section for purchasing Gordon merchandise) while dinner menu was printed.  To me this seemed like a vain attempt to appear tech savvy as there was no real value in the iPad (you couldn't order from it, pay with it , surf the Internet, or even see a menu).  The merchandise offering (t-shirts, shot glasses, etc) made me feel like Gordon was more concerned with emptying my wallet than serving a delightful meal and cheapened the whole experience.  Good grief, if I choose a restaurant with $$$$ on Yelp, I don't expect an experience reminiscent of Stucky's roadside travel center.\n\nThe high point of the evening was the bread plate served before the meal.  Breads were delicious as was the butter. \n\nI ordered Lobster Wellington and my wife had the Beef Wellington.  Sides like baked potato and mac & cheese were around $13 so I passed on those.  The menu stated 45 minute wait for Wellington, but they dishes came much earlier (the second high point after the bread).  My wife enjoyed her meal but my lobster was tough, tough, tough.  In fact, each time I tried to cut into it with my steak knife, the knife would slide off the lobster and peel off the Wellington crust.  Once I managed to pin a piece down I had to saw/tear it apart...a far cry from the tender, butter smooth lobster I experienced at a competing restaurant the night beforehand.\n\nDuring the meal the service was OK, but water refills were a bit slow and check ins from the waiter a bit half-hearted.\n\nSo to sum this up, no, I will not be returning, and no, I will not recommend Ramsay Gordon Steak to others.  The food was OK but pricey, the service was OK but insincere, and the environment was OK did not seem \"classy\" to me.  Sorry Gordon, but in your zeal to market yourself I think you've lost the essence of fine dining, and this one in particular is a miss."

It was not hard to find if you enter from the Strip entrance of the Paris hotel especially when it has a red grand entrance.  The tables seem to be running late when we arrived on time and still had to wait about 5-10 minutes.\n\nFor drinks, you order from an iPad menu, which was quite neat.  First item our server introduced to us was the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu, which was a 4 course meal for $145/person featuring dishes from Hell's Kitchen.  The odd was actually requiring everyone in your party to order it.  Price was reasonable for high-end fine dining, but too bad the wife was not onboard, so I could not try it.  I guess pick your party carefully next time?\n\nWe started the meal with British Ale Soup and Maine Lobster.  The soup tasted ok, it reminds of a bad French onion soup.  The lobster had some great combined flavor with a decent sauce and nuts at the bottom.  The breads were actually very good, and there were about three different varieties.\n\nFor main course, we ended up getting the Beef Wellington for two, they can only cook it at Medium Rare for some unknown reasons, good thing both of us eat steaks at that rareness.  Since they baked the steak and combining with the pastry, it really did taste like a roast beef sandwich in some ways.  The potato puree really resembled mash potato on the side.  It tasted great overall.\n\nService was excellent that night and we briefly saw Christina Wilson when we first sat down.  I think I will return once I gathered the correct foodie and spendy party next time.  The ordering just felt too restricted."

We were seated upstairs, in a very nice booth, and were attended to very well.  For such a large, and busy restaurant, the noise level was reasonable.  Incredible wine list, helpfully shown on a tablet computer.  I will say though, it took me awhile to sort through the listings; the menu structure was not very user friendly!  Three of us had the beef wellington and one rib eye.  It took the advertised 45 minutes, but they went fast as we enjoyed our wine.  No complaints from anyone, the food was excellent and well served as it should be at this price level!  Side dishes included the mac and cheese and caesar salads, each equally good. For me the portions were just fine, but I am at a point in life now where I frequently share entrees.  Still, we brought some back to our hotel!  Given the choices in this city, not sure I would come back.  Expected just a bit more!"

            "review": "This was our first time eating at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and I have to say with was one of the best experiences we ever had.  We booked the reservation through OpenTable.  The waiter's name that took care of us was Anthony.  He was very warm in greeting my wife, daughter and I.  When we booked our reservation we did mention that it was our 15th Anniversary and they were very attentive to that details of what the occasion was.  Having it be our first time there, Anthony was really good about explaining all the details of the menu even so much taking time in telling us about the various cuts of meat the offer.  He even explained what cut was and where it comes from and even spoke about taste and other details.  It was very informative and definitely helped with our decision making process.  After getting a better understanding about the meats  and the menu my wife and I decided on the Roasted Beef Wellington.  Not having it before I really didn't know what to expect.  It was the best decision I made.  The meat was REMARKABLE!!  It was like butter melting in your mouth.  The flavor and texture was absolutely indescribably.  I would highly recommend it to anyone trying Gordon Ramsey Steak for the first time.  My daughter selected the Rib Eye steak which was also good.  Not only was Anthony a great waiter, the food was great but also the service by our busboy was excellent.  The gentleman's name was Ben and he provided us with great care and service as well.  It is because of employees like this why our dining experiences have been so good!  Kudos to Gordon Ramsey and the staff at Gordon Ramsey Steak!  You will definitely see us again!  You all truly made our anniversary very special!!"

You really cannot get Beef Wellington like this at any other steakhouse that I have been too. This is what Gordon is known for, absolutely special and worth any wait. The service was impeccable and the restaurant was very cool. A wonderful meal and a can't miss when in Vegas."

I was right and our food was excellent and the service was outstanding. Anthony was our server and he knew how to treat us. His recommendations were spot on. We started with apps.. Most notably was the smoked beef tartare and the bone marrow. I had the Beef Wellington.. Awesome! My mom and my wife had the ribeye and I tasted those as well. Cooked to perfection. We had an awesome dinning experience and we all look forward to the next time. Hopefully Anthony can serve us again because he was awesome!"

            "review": "I was here in late October, 2012. A group of friends and I went for another friend's birthday and we wanted to try some place special. This place did not disappoint! There were 12 of us in our group and we waited too long to get a prime reservation time, so we settled for 5:30pm. I am not a fan of eating early, as it makes me feel like I'm going to the early bird so I can get back in time for Matlock. However, with this being a special occasion, we took what we could get and learned from our procrastination. \n\nWe arrived promptly for our reservation and were immediately taken to our table. The table was huge and gorgeous. Our 12-person party had plenty of room and felt quite special with where they chose to sit us. Our server introduced herself and she was quite pleasant and knowledgeable. Keep in mind, we intended to do this up right, so we were settling in for a long night and informed our server of our plan. She was happy to spend the evening taking care of us and it showed in her playful attitude. \n\nBetween everyone in our group, we nearly ordered everything on the menu. I myself ordered two entrees because I wanted to try both the Halibut and the Rib Tip. As I like to say, I did it just for the halibut! I'm sure no one has heard that before. \n\nI could go into everything that we ordered, but it doesn't matter; it was all delicious. Like I said, we ordered just about everything on the menu and we shared and passed around everything like it was a holiday meal. All-in-all we were there for three hours. There was no one trying to rush us out the door so they could turn the table (that is first on my \"do not do\" list for servers, followed by \"act like you want to be here and you want me to be here\"). \n\nThe food, the service, the ambiance and the whole experience was well worth it. Oh yeah, we got to meet the winner of Hell's Kitchen, Christina Wilson. She graciously allowed a few of our friends to take pictures with her. Of course, she was super busy, so they tried not to bother her too much.\n\nIf you have the time and are in Vegas for a special occasion I would say this is a must do. It is on the expensive side, but it is an experience you will never forget. Personally, I'm a fan of expensive, well-worth-it meals. I can't think of a better way to spend time with friends.\n\nOne last thing...the cocktails!!!  So amazing. My favorite is The Drifter. This consists of a special batch of Knob Creek bourbon (delicious by itself) added to a little ginger liqueur, falernum (a sweet citrus mixer found mainly in Caribbean drinks) and a little lemon bitters. Oh man this is so good. It is served with a big ball of ice, only one. This helps to keep it chilled without watering it down.  I must say, I have spent the past holiday season trying to perfect it at home and I've come very close. It is about 98% there and I'll take it. I did call the restaurant, but the were reluctant to help me out on the ratios. Luckily my five years experience of tending bar helped me get closer than acceptable, yet just out of reach of perfect.\n\nGo and have fun!"

            "review": "Last time I had gone to Vegas, I had really wanted to try Gordon Ramsay steak - you know for the oh so famous beef wellington. Couldn't go with the family last time, so instead, this next I went to LV, I went with a friend of mine. \n\nFirst, cute and creative way into the restaurant. Riding the tube underneath and channel to get to London and the restaurant from Paris (the city and casino). Second, there's this huge red lit sculpture at the ceiling which is apparently Chef Ramsay's hand movements when he plates beef wellington. Kind of looks like a bunch of squiggles, but pretty cool regardless. \n\nThe Drink: \nPimm's Cup: Apparently this had gin and sparkling lemonade. It literally tasted like fruit juice to my friend and me. Definitely dangerous since you could drink it and not taste the alcohol. Love the fruit that it comes with. \n\nThe Food: \nBread (Lemon thyme, Mushroom and pancetta, and baguette): all three of them were different and delicious. Eat them. Get seconds. The butter is delicious too with the sprinkling of sea salt on top.\nFoie gras: Yes! I love foie gras, especially if it's been seared correctly. This foie was melt in your mouth deliciousness. The goat cheese popovers were a great little contrast in taste, but definitely same creaminess expected. \nBeef Wellington: You can definitely share the plate for 1. It comes in 2 pieces so you can definitely share. The mashed potatoes are nice and creamy just as I expected Gordon Ramsey's mashed potatoes should be (you know after watching people make them in Hells Kitchen for years). \nRibcap: Definitely didn't have other stuff on it, but it was so tender and easy to cut through. The ribcap is definitely a must do. It's tender as filet mignon and as bold as ribeye. YUM!\nMac n Cheese: Nothing too memorable about it. Wasn't too bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Good, but nothing compared to the meat we had gotten. \nSticky Toffee Pudding: Just the description of the dessert made it sound delicious - sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream. The cake was not too sweet, but the toffee made it moist and gooey - almost like a bread pudding with caramel on it. The brown butter ice cream was oh so good, I just wished there had been a lot more of it. Also prepared so it looked like we were getter butter which I thought was really creative. \n\nOverall, such a good meal. We ate like royalty and it was delicious.  Service was pretty good throughout the night, and we noted that there were 3 different type of individuals working the floor that interacted with us. It was pretty fun to go out, get a little dressed up and eat a great dinner. \n\nProtip: Get a reservation. Get the beef wellington. it's probably Ramsey's most famous dish and deservingly so. The sticky toffee pudding is definitely worth the calories."

I brought a very nice bottle of wine and knew the corkage was expensive...35$...but the wine I brought would have been over $200 here. \n\nWe sat at the bar as we were early for our reservation...my fault. So we ordered the beef Wellington for two to go with our wine....had a glass of a really nice Poulle Fuisee to go with our shrimp appetizer....really good, (by the way the sommelier we had was awesome)...So why only three stars? They told us it would take 45 minutes for the Beef Wellington....but they forgot us and it took almost an hour and a half. By that time we had finished our wine and were ready to walk out. I would have thought the bar tender would have offered us a glass of wine on the house but she did not. \n\nThe Wellington was just ok.....under seasoned and for  something that took an hour and a half should have been piping hot....it was not. \n\nNext time in Vegas I will go to my old standby restaurant at Paris....Mon Ami Gabi...half the price and the food is better."

            "review": "We decided to try GR Steak for our one high end dinner out on our last trip to Vegas.  We always try to fit a really nice meal in each time we come.  The food, in general, was very good, and the cocktails were fantastic (especially the blueberry aperitif).  The downside of the drinks are that they took forever to come, the waiter took our drink orders within about 10 minutes of us sitting down - not speedy, but not ridiculous either - however they took about 30 minutes to come to the table.  That's 40 minutes before even putting in a dinner order.  I don't think that's a reasonable time frame.\n\nMy parents-in-law had the Wellington for two, my sister-in-law had the Wellington for one, and my wife and I shared the Royal Long Bone Chop.  The Wellingtons were amazing, as expected given their status of 'signature dish'.  The salads and sides were also great, exactly what one would expect from a restaurant of this calibre (especially the mac and cheese, by far the best I've ever tried).  The steak, however, was pretty underwhelming.  I've eaten at a number of higher end steakhouses and been really blown away by a few.  This was good; the seasoning was good, the cook on the steak was good, the presentation was good.  None of it was great though, and the meat was somewhat chewy.  It would have been fine for a $50 32oz steak, but not for $100.  We got through about half of it, mostly because we were really hungry after waiting another hour for the entr\u00e9es to arrive, but eventually decided to say something.  \n\nThe manager was very confrontational, telling us that we had no place to complain because she checked on the table earlier and everything was fine.  That's true, but she checked about 30 seconds after the food came out, so our answer was based entirely on the mac and cheese at the time.  My wife started to mention that our expectations for the service and the  steak at a place like this are higher, and that they were very well reviewed in general on sites like Yelp (and many of it's counterparts), to which the manager asked my wife if she was threatening her.  Yes, 'threatening her\".  I considered walking out at that point, and I'm sure Gordon Ramsay would have thrown a frying pan her way if he'd  heard something like that from his manager.  \n\nWe then asked to speak with the general manager and he came to the table (15 minutes later) and offered us free dessert.  It was a nice gesture, but we were a little tired of waiting around at that point.  He took care of the wine on the bill, fair enough since the steak was half eaten.  \n\nEven though I can't fault the GM for how he handled it, we unfortunately still left with a negative perception of the restaurant because of the outright rudeness of the previous manager.  Her name is Amanda, and she has no business working in the service industry."

            "review": "I don't get all the negativity here on some of the reviews. \n\nThere are a million \"Fine Steakhouses\" in Vegas, you need to stand out to get the business these days and Steak did imo. If you want the quiet 5 star experience this may not be for you, but if you like great food in a trendy setting, it's the place to be. \n\nMy wife an I were there about 6 weeks ago (haven't had time to do Vegas reviews since we got back), the food was excellent and the ambiance was just fine. \n\nWe got there about 5 minutes before our 6p reservation on a Sunday and were seated immediately. We had seats in the middle of the balcony so you got to \"take the entire restaurant in,\" I think part of Steak is the experience that some complain about. \n\nWe did the 5 course tasting menu (was the Summer tasting menu). It's a bit pricey to do the tasting menu, but most tasting menu's are ($140pp)  and I'd only do it once because some of the other stuff looked so tasty, but as a HK fan you get a hand signed GR photo with the menu as a keepsake for each diner as well (and Christine the HK season 9 winner who still works at Steak which was her prize, she signed it as well between her expediting) . It's also the only way to do Gordon's famous diver scallop risotto. \n\nSo the tasting menu was: \n\nHeirloom Salad ( I forgot the name special name): Had an excellent sauce with it, good starter. \n\nAlso got the complementary bread plate which was phenomenal, I think it had 4 different types of buns/rolls, my wife didn't even have to ask the waiter saw how much we enjoyed it and when he saw her grin when he said something he just brought more.   \n\nScotch Egg: I've had a few of these over the years, these were hands down the best I've ever had. Another \"lick your plate clean\" between the sauce, egg and cabbage. \n\nDiver Sea Scallop Risotto: Excellent, wish there was more, it's the reason so many try this menu and I understand why. \n\nBeef Wellington: My wife who's not a huge meat eater finished hers before I was half way done with mine. Only bummer about this is you only get about a half portion as the regular menu (but the 5 courses fill you up). Excellent, my wife, the usually at least medium well to well done beef eater when she ever eats it thought it was great. It was melt in your mouth good, the pure with it excellent as well. \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream: It's as good as you hope, too often at places you have this amazing meal only to have a subpar desert (if you have one) This one did not disappoint, for those that don't like sweet deserts, don't put a ton of the caramel on the cake, I do though so I loved it. The ice cream (which is shaped like a stick of butter) also phenomenal.\n\nWe had the service you'd expect at a restaurant of this caliber and the food to go with it. Again I wouldn't do the tasting menu again, more because I'd like to try other things on the menu when I'm there next time, but if you're an HK fan do it, you shouldn't be disappointed. And I'm sure this will become a regular stop on my trips to Vegas."

Our food and drinks were delivered to the wrong people and had to be switched.

We were never asked how the food was even though more than one plate was left untouched because it was disgusting. After 3 hours we begged for our check ready to leave and ask to split the bill. Our waiter seemed irritated and left. He came back twice unable to split the bill correctly and finally just threw the bill on the table and told us to figure it out! My mother quickly grabbed a manager and only then was our waiter suddenly there to help us sort the mess. No compensation was offered no form of apology. It's very sad we had 1000 bill and we were expecting a life changing food experience and I have gotten better food and service from in and out. I will never go back!"

I don't usually dine at places as classy as this, so I was really taken aback when I was handed an iPad to use for surfing through the wine list. We had the Beaujolais Nouveau. I don't care if it wasn't in season yet, I wanted it and they had it! The wine went really well with our bone-in rib-eye steak. NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM! That mouthwatering goodness. I want to go back and finish all 24 oz on my own! It was huge. And, totally do-able once you know how frikkin' yummy it is...I mean you see how big this thing is gonna be when they show it to you on that magical meat cart that they push around so you know they mean business...and you tell yourself that it's impossible to eat the whole 24 oz on your own. You're wrong. You can. It's that good. Oh! And, let's not forget the loaded baked potato that stood by my rib-eye. It had the usual sour cream and chives, as one may expect. However, it was thick-cut bacon (slices, not pieces) and gouda bechamel to topped it off that made it absolute heaven.\n\nThank you for feeding me."

I can only imagine there are a bunch of guys in the back of the kitchen refilling those blue and red bottles from the tap and laughing hysterically as they unwittingly charge all the idiots in the restaurant like us big bucks for it. \n\nSeriously though, the entire meal was like a caricature of a dining experience. The service was so stuffy and our server acted completed offended when my wife asked if they could make a small change to one of the items. I mean, how dare she ask to alter one of \"Chef Ramsay's\" signature dishes!?!?\n\nAfter that the server acted like our table of plebes wasn't worthy of this amazing \"Chef Ramsay\" experience. \n\nBut let's focus on the food, because that is, after all, the primary reason we came. The beef wellington was by far the most overrated restaurant dish I have ever tasted. Yes, the cook and texture of the steak was fine. The pastry was completely flavorless and soggy and I scraped it off of my meat and didn't even finish it. The pureed potatoes and vegetables were cold. When I mentioned it the response was, \"oh well those are really only for garnish anyway\". Really? I have to believe the kitchen is just mass producing beef wellingtons and our pre-made plate must have been sitting forever waiting for the steak to hit. \n\nProblem is, the reality here fell far short of the expectation. If you watch Gordon Ramsay on TV you'd be led to believe he's a perfectionist who would never allow cold food to go out on a plate, and yet there it was, in a restaurant with his name on the door. \n\nReally disappointing."

I've had many tell me that Gordon Ramsay's Steak is the best steak house in Vegas, so my expectations were very high.  Overall, the food was very good, but I wasn't blown away.  \n\nThe food was great, but nothing that \"wowed\" me as an experience.\nAppetizers:  We ordered the pork belly (amazing) and raw oysters (definitely fresh and tasty)\n\nSteaks:  Between the four of us, we ordered two rib-eyes, one filet, and one American Kobe Rib Cap steak.  All were great steaks, though the two rib-eyes and filet were all ordered medium-rare but each came looking three different \"stages\" of medium rare... the filet was closer to the rare side, one rib-eye was \"the perfect\" medium rare, and mine was closer to the medium.  Regardless, none of us was disappointed about getting a great steak.\n\nService:  We had a waiter and bus-boy serving us for the evening.  Both did a great job taking care of us and checking in... not too often but also not leaving us long enough to feel like we were being ignored.  I'm not a service snob, by any means, but I've been to several other steak places in Vegas and there's something that's missing with the service here... it's something about the feel of the staff not being personable.  They seemed distant and it felt that when we tried to engage in conversation with the staff, they spoke to us as if they were being monitored.\n\nOverall... food was great, services was great, environment was nice (though loud)... but for the price we paid and the hype we had, I expected a different dinning experience, especially in Vegas where there are so many other places.  \n\nI'm glad I dined here to try it out but it didn't make me want to come back, especially with so many other places to try in Vegas."

Great wine list to pair with the wide array of steaks that are brought out to each customer on their custom meat tray. I suggest ordering the 4-course pairing. Started with the Roasted Beet salad w/ ricotta, mushrooms and a champagne vinaigrette. 2nd course was the Asparagus Soup w/ dungeness crab, Parmesan custard and smoked caviar. By far, the best soup I have had in Las Vegas. 3rd course was the special Roasted Beef Wellington w/ red wine demi glace. Our dessert was a fantastic Panna Cotta w/ sorbet and a candied twill. One of the best meals in a while. Left fully satisfied and not too gorged on the wallet. We paired dinner with the 2009 Honig Cabernet Sauvignon. Phenom wine for value. Will be back. \nOther entrees dying to try: Hanger Steak and Rib Cap.\n\nVisited May 2012."

She explained the types of food offered and pointed out the fluorescent lighting fixture in the center of the ceiling, saying it was a depiction of Gordon's hands cooking. It just looked like random fluorescents to me.\n\nAnyway, after we were seated the waiter came over and took our drink orders. When it came time to order our food, a cart of uncooked steak was wheeled out to our table and we were given an explanation of each cut. I ended up ordering the 32oz porterhouse, homemade steak sauce and truffle infused macaroni and cheese.  \n\nAfter about 30 minutes our food arrived. The porterhouse I ordered was HUGE and looked like something straight out of a food magazine, perfect in every way. When I took the first bite I just about melted in my chair. The taste was pure perfection. Even though I was full about half way through I made sure to eat the rest. \n\nThe macaroni and cheese was also very good. You could really taste the truffle and the texture was spot on. The only downside to this place is the price. You are going to pay $$$ for this meal, but it is worth every penny and will be something you will remember for a long time. I wanted to try dessert, but was absolutely too full to even attempt a few bites. I only give 5 stars if my experience was truly exceptional. This establishment exceeded my expectations."

Donnie was our waiter and could not be more enjoyable. He made the experience even more enjoyable. After looking at the menu we decided to go with the Hells Kitchen experience. I don't normally eat eggs but the Scotch egg was thoroughly enjoyable. I am not a beet person but the beet salad was not all that bad, then came the good parts, the scallop risotto was to die for but only got a half portion, also the beef Wellington is all the hype they put with it...I have never enjoyed a meal as much as this one. The toffee pudding was also the most enjoyable thing I have ever tasted.  I could not even finish my dessert.\n\n....now for the reason that I did not give 5 stars....the price of the Hells Kitchen experience was $145 per person...which was okay by me...until the portions came out half...half a scallop risotto, half a beef Wellington. It costs us over $400 for 2 of us and we only got half portions of the food we so craved.  \n\nWe did walk out of there full, fat, and happy...but for $400 I would have liked to have some take home food...\n\nThe experience as a whole...I walked out of there with a grin from ear to ear, I have 2 signed pictures of Gordon Ramsay and the reminisce of the meal still lingering on my mind.  I will eat here again but this time I will get my full portion of beef Wellington. \n\nAs for our server Donnie, he was a delight and I would request him to experience the same feeling I had the first time. \n\nI recommend if you have a couple dollars to splurge definately try Gordon Ramsay steak!!!"

My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary. \n\nWe only waited a minute or two to be seated. Our table was facing the kitchen, which was kinda cool. The music was \"club like\" and relatively loud, but we enjoyed it. We started by ordering drinks using the iPad menu. It took a while for our drinks to arrive (not only the initial drinks, but also subsequent drinks). We then ordered the onion soup (which was good) and Caesar salad. We ordered an appetizer, the Maine Lobster stuffed with chorizo. I do not recommend this appetizer. It was very small, cold, and very tough. We were honest with the waiter and he mentioned something to the chef. Next, we ordered our entrees. Beef Wellington, Prime filet, and a couple ounces of the A5 Japanese Kobe filet. The Beef Wellington was ok. We did really enjoy the Prime filet. I wouldn't wasted the money on the Japanese Kobe. The outside was charred and inside really had no taste. I had this once before at another restaurant and really enjoyed it, but the preparation was not acceptable this time. We also ordered the truffle mac and cheese, as well as the potato puree. Both sides were very good. \n\nNow, I realize I am not a restauranteur, but I've been to a variety of high end restaurants. I know good service when I experience it. Here are some tips that could change my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.\n\nTIP #1: If I have a customer who has flown across the country to share a special event, such as an anniversary, I would at a minimum acknowledge it. This did not happen in our case.\n\nTIP #2: If a customer has an issue with any part of the meal, I would insist either the chef or manager to acknowledge the mishap and try to correct it. A little feedback goes a long way.\n\nTIP #3: If I am a manager of a restaurant, I would attempt to greet the customers to ensure everything (food, service, etc.) is top notch. The customers are the best source of intel. \n\nTIP #4: If I worked for one of the world's top chefs and restauranteur, I would go out of my way to be the best, instead of being a social butterfly within the restaurant. On multiple occasions, I spotted our waiter engaged in extended conversations with two guys in suits (one with a bow tie). They appeared to be some type of management, but we cannot confirm that since they never introduced themselves. \n\nWe were very disappointed with the overall experience of this restaurant. The lack of attentive service was probably the most disappointing thing. My wife and I had higher expectations for this restaurant.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a good high end restaurant in Vegas, I would consider another restaurant, such as STK or Craft Steak. Hopefully, management and the wait staff will take a look in the mirror and bring their standards up to the Gordon Ramsay expectations."

As for our sides, we ordered the brussel sprouts, corn, crab cakes and scallops. \n\nThe red meats were all fantastic and very fulfilling. The wellington is a fillet minon wrapped in a buttery pastry shell. A5 wagyu is a very tender meat that literally melts in your mouth. Very fatty and only a small amount served as an appetite would suffice. I can't imagine having this as an entree considering the amount of fat it contains. The ribcap is my favorite. Cooked to perfection; very tender and juicy. Tomahawk was my least favorite. Although it is cooked at medium rare, the meat is tough and a bit chewy. \n\nThe sides were all excellent and we had no complaints! The dessert we ordered was phenomenal. I can't remember the name, but I believe it was the sticky toffee (?) with a side of butter stick. Yes, it was a stick of brown butter ice cream that was THE BEST ice cream I ever had!! \n\nOverall, this place is a must-try when you're in LV. One of my favorite restaurants in the strip!"

The day before our reservations, we just happened to be in Paris, and walked over to the restaurant, just to look at the menu, AGAIN, and get a sneak peek inside.

I toyed about giving this place 5 stars but our welcome to the restaurant really let the place down.  We'd booked a table but still ended up waiting for over half an hour before we were finally seated and the bar area really isn't big enough to have so many people hovering about.  I felt particularly bad for the people at the bar having their meal surrounded by grumpy hungry guest waiting to be seated.  Once we did get to our table though I really couldn't fault the service.  I'd read the reviews about the raw meat being brought out and the various cuts being explained by the waiter and, although this does happen and there's a lot of raw meat on display, I like to know what I'm getting so it didn't bother me at all.  My husband and I went all out, he had the French onion soup (delicious) and I the pork belly (out of this world) to start, we then shared the sliders (very substantial and tasty) followed by the beef Wellington (absolutely to die for) and we then shared the sticky toffee pudding.  Now, I'm British so Ive had some pretty fantastic sticky toffee puddings in my time (I also make a pretty good one myself) so the pudding wasn't the best I've ever had and is expected better from Gordon but it was tasty all the same.  You could spend a hell of a lot more on a special meal in Vegas and, for the price we paid, I was really impressed with the food and service.  Our meal for two came to $260 which was pretty good considering we could barely eat a thing for a full day after our meal.  Also worth a note to say the wine was exceptional and the staff were well placed to make sound recommendations.  Overall it's well worth a visit here if you want a special meal that's actually going to fill you and you're going to thoroughly enjoy!!!"

I had the beef wellington, signature dish, and I see why. It was very good. My wife had bone in ribeye and she was not as impressed. It was a bit tough and not as flavorful as other steakhouses' ribeye. We were sort of fooled with size of sides. We were told by the waiter they were individual but they were large enough to share so we over ordered. Also, all sides came out on the cool side which was disappointing."

He made us smile (and laugh!) right from the start and his knowledge and recommendations for the food were truly appreciated.  We had the 24 oz Royal Long-Bone Chop for 2 - melt-in-your-mouth tender. Others at the table had the Beef Wellington (what's not to love about that!), and we enjoyed a number of sides. It was a toss up between the mac and cheese and those truffled fingerling potatoes for us. Or maybe the heirloom carrots (who knew carrots could be that good?) or the mushrooms? Wait - can't forget the unique selection of breads served at the start. Yup, we asked for 2nds. And the Sticky Toffee Pudding - heaven! Went to Gordon Ramsey's Grill and Pub the next day to have it again - without having to share it.  Plan on visiting again when we're back in Vegas this September. And, Dennis, we really hope to see you again!"

This time it was my 4 girlfriends and I for dinner before Lady Gaga (had to get our meat on!).\n\nOur friend made the ressies for 5:45 (they start seating at 5pm) and we checked in, had the door opened for us and then left in the \"Chunnel\".  A manager guy came over to see why we were alone and offered a seat in the bar, so we sat for 5 mins.  A then not so with it, but very pretty (good thing she was pretty) waitress took us to our \"kitchen side\" table, which was NOT kitchen side as we requested.  We were told Christina (winner of Hell's Kitchen 10) had the kitchen side table reserved which bummed us out but then the GM (JP from Hell's Kitchen!) came over and moved us promptly to a kitchen side table!  We were star struck!  Lol. \n\nOur waiter Adrian (had him before) was very helpful with meat choices (love the \"wheel of meat they bring out!) and starters and sides.  The beef tartar was fantastic (per my friends) and my fois gras was amazing. We had everything from the filet to rib cap to tuna tartar.  It was all beautifully done and tasted like heaven.  \n\nLove this place.  Book early, try and get a kitchen side table if you can.  Enjoy every morsel of food and every sip of wine."

I'm serious.\n\nNot only was our visit to GR Steak the best meal we had during our trip to Vegas, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had. At 30 years old eating three meals a day, I've had 32,850 meals thus far in life; my GR Steak dinner is easily in the top five.\n\nOur server Olga provided superior service. She was personable and witty, which made our experience fun. Because I made reservations through OpenTable, she knew my name and used it throughout dinner, which I thought was a nice touch from a customer service perspective. \n\nThe bread plate was fantastic. Savory pastries were delicious with tasty butter. Husband ate the classic beef Wellington entree, and I had the Pacific salmon. During dinner, I had to say it: \"this is the best salmon I've ever had.\" While the fish came with a sauce, lemon wedge and diced veggies, it didn't need them. The fish was so fresh and perfectly cooked that just the fish itself was heavenly. Husband raved about his Wellington. \n\nLast but not least: dessert, which was the sticky toffee pudding. Wow, wow, WOW! The cake was rich, moist and decadent; the warm toffee syrup was from heaven; and the brown butter ice cream topped off everything wonderfully! I can't call the sticky toffee pudding \"delicious\" -- it's beyond delicious, and the English language doesn't have a word to describe it. This is the best dessert dish in all of Vegas. While I have not tried every dessert dish available in Vegas, I don't need to -- I'm confident no dessert can top the sticky toffee pudding. \n\nWhile I saw shows, ate at several restaurants, and won some dough on the slots at the Venetian while in Vegas, the true highlight of my Vegas trip was my dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak."

So I figured I had to try this place and Ramsay's acclaimed beef wellington.\n\nSadly, it really did not live up to expectations. The service was friendly, but insanely slow even though the area we were seated in was nearly empty. The whole night started off badly when we had to stand and wait for some 5 minutes at the front before anybody even offered to find our reservation or seat us. What was worse was there had to be like 5-6 employees just standing around talking.\n\nThe steaks are definitely tender and cooked exactly as you request. But the steak I received was luke warm at best when I finally got it, what gives? The Beef Wellington, while a nice variety of flavors, just wasn't what I expected. I still prefer a properly cooked steak a la carte.\n\nThe scotch egg was good. The bone marrow, if it is your thing, was also very well done. The sauteed mushrooms had a weird overpowering flavor that I can only relate to \"fake bacon\" flavoring.\n\nThe sticky toffee dessert was actually quite good, in fact, probably one of the best desserts I have had in my life. If you get anything here, get that.\n\nAll in all, I've had better food preparation, presentation, service, and flavor overall at a variety of other places. The fact that I spent over $250 alone on my meal here makes it entirely not worth it for what you get.\n\nSadly, I really cannot recommend this place, other than to try the Beef Wellington and cross it off your list of things to do. Ramsay should really visit this place and shape it up."

Let me explain...as a high end restaurant, especially owned by Gordon Ramsay, who is HUGE on service and perfection, this was a big let down. I made reservations 2 months in advance, at 5pm, when the restaurant supposedly opened. On that day, we walked in at 4:50, and was told to wait inside. Okay, sure no problem. We walked in with no idea where to go or where to stand...no one walked us in or gave us any updates on whether our table would be ready or not. We watched as other groups who were just \"walk-ins\" get seated by smiling hostesses immediately and served. 5:05 rolls around and wait a second, for such a classy restaurant, wouldn't you at least have someone let us know why we weren't seated at our reservation time? I had a friend actually LEAVE our group because he was insulted (overdramatic? I'm not too sure...) and I had to go outside remind the hostesses that we were still there.\n\nThe hostess there gave no apology, kept insisting that we came early (um, hello, so? It's still past our reservation time...and shouldn't customer be always right?) and pretty much shooed me away. We were already pretty insulted, and feeling awkward from my friend walking off. A hostess finally came over and led us to our table, but not before presenting Gordon Ramsay's pretty sculpture on the ceiling and walking off. We didn't know if we should follow her or not until she was all the way up the stairs...oops. \n\nAfter we were sat down, it took a while for our waiter to come around and get our menus. Then it took a while for the waiter to take our order. Then it took a while....well, basically, I feel like being up the stairs made it harder for the waiters to come over, and when they did, the entire upstairs was saturated with them. It was always either too crowded or too empty.\n\nLuckily, as it got more towards a normal dinner time (6ish?), the service got more consistent (more people near our area means the waiters need to come around more yes?) and service was much better. Food was ALL good...right down to the complimentary free bread with butter and volcanic sea salt. Beef was tender, seafood was cooked to perfection, and OMG the toffee pudding is definitely one of its kind! Even the brussel sprouts had generous giant slabs of high quality bacon.\n\nOverall, food is great, atmosphere is wow, and waiters/servers were nice towards the end...but the attitude I got from the reservations/front desk was not something I'd expect from Gordon Ramsay."

            "review": "There is only one word to describe this restaurant: Amazing!\n\nThis place is super pricey but worth every penny. While in Vegas you would normally think that a buffet would give you more bang for your buck but coming here was truly an amazing experience.\n\nFirst off, the staff and decor were fabulous. My boyfriend and I made a reservation at 7:45 and we arrived around 7:42 and we were seated right away. The wait staff was friendly, nice, and attentive coming by every 10 mins or so asking if we needed anything. It was a hectic night because luckily for us that was the night Ramsay himself decided to eat dinner with his family there. I had a chance to get a quick picture with the man himself before he went off to his table. Even with the big man himself there the staff took very good care of us and made sure we had everything we needed. The decor was very homey, it was a bit louder than your average romantic restaurant, but I would recommend taking any size party to this restaurant since the mood seems to accompany any sort of party.\n\nNow on to the food. We ordered the Smoked Beef Tartare as an appetizer along with the famous Beef Wellington, the mac and cheese side, and the infamous sticky toffee pudding.\n\nFirst off the bread was amazing! There were four different kinds of bread and I cant exactly remember what kind but each had its own unique taste and there was a perfect amount of it. \n\nNow onto the appetizer. The smoked beef was delicious and came accompanied by a nicely plated skewer of potato chips. Presentation was wonderful since the smoked beef came in a bell jar and when the waiter opened it the smoke seeped out creating a fun presentation. It was small but a perfect course for two people to share.\n\nNext we have the main course: The one and only Beef Wellington. First off my boyfriend and I eat very little compared to most people so we ordered the Wellington for one. The wait staff kindly had the chef split the Wellington onto two plates. The first bite was amazing. The meat melted like butter in your mouth and the mashed veggies that came along with it were an amazing accompaniment. The beef was perfectly well seasoned and the puff pastry was just thick enough so that it did not overwhelm the dish. \n\nNow what really made my visit was the mac and cheese. It is unlike any other mac and cheese you have ever had. It was rich and creamy with the perfect blend of different cheeses. It takes mac and cheese to a whole new level and Ramsay has officially ruined mac and cheese for me. \n\nNow at this point, my boyfriend and I were already stuffed satisfied but we had to order desert. The sticky Toffee Pudding came with a butter shaped ice cream and it was deliciously dreamy. The ice cream was so smooth I have never tasted an ice cream like it before. It went really well with brown cake it was served with (not sure what its called forgive me). We were only able to finish the ice cream and we took the cake to go but even after days in the fridge the cake was still moist and delicious. \n\nOverall my experience here was wonderful. I am not a woman of much money so my wallet took a big hit but it was well worth it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants their taste buds to experience something unforgettable."

We'd dined there back in July '13 in the main dining room and had been suitably impressed enough to select it for our post-wedding celebration.  After confirming that it offered private rooms (I saw a total of three rooms...there could be more) up on the second level that could accommodate a party of 15 comfortably, we were sold.  We arrived a few minutes early for our 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  The dining room and bar were pretty much at capacity.  We were led upstairs to our room.  One of our party required the use of a walker.  No worries, as there was an elevator next to the staircase leading upstairs.  \n\nSince it was the wife and my party, we opted for the Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu for the group.  The menu was virtually the same as the one we'd had previously although the salad and dessert courses had changed.  When we made the reservations and laid down the deposit, we asked to have the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream instead of the listed dessert and they graciously agreed.    \n\nOur final menu was the following:\nAmuse Bouche - Scotch Egg with Berkshire pork sausage & red wine braised cabbage\nFirst Course - Spring Vegetable Salad, fennel seared ahi, pea shoots, asparagus and candied rhubarb\nSecond Course - Scallop Risotto with seared scallop, spring mushroom farro risotto, black trumpet puree, grilled ramp\nThird Course - Roasted Beef Wellington with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, and red wine demi glace\nDessert Course - Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream\n\nEach course was beautiful in its presentation and executed perfectly.  Our guests were all smiles after each course.  Portion sizes were plentiful, yet never oversized.  Even my mom who eats like a bird finished every last bite.  However, the dessert course seemed to be the one that everyone raved about the most!      \n\nService throughout our meal was impeccable as we were attended to in a friendly and efficient manner.  Water glasses were always topped off and cocktail and wine service was fast and knowledgeable.   The sommelier guided us to a great bottle of wine, Dutch Henry Winery 2007 Napa Valley CS.  One of the most memorable sights was seeing 15 servers serve each course in front of each of the 15 guests in our party simultaneously.  Maybe it was to be expected, but it's the little touches that often make the lasting impression.     \n\nThe only critique I have from our experience was how it ended.  Our lead server asked the wife if she'd like to finish off our night with coffee and cognac service.  She said, \"Yes,\" and soon a tray with three different bottles of cognac appeared.  While the names of the bottles of cognac were given, unfortunately not the cost for each 1.5 oz pour.  As a result, a few glasses of Louis XIII were ordered, one of which was by my dad who had no idea of its cost and I think ordered it because it came in a striking bottle.  He nearly had a heart attack when he found out how much it cost.  At least he enjoyed it!  Still, this pricey hiccup aside, our meal was exceedingly satisfying.  Our guests pushed back from the table quite pleased...and, most importantly, the experience will be one the wife and I won't ever forget."

As a treat, my husband and I made reservations here since we are avid Hell's Kitchen/master chef/all around Gordon Ramsay fans.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and the hostess seated us in the lounge.  I love the atmosphere there and how they utilize new technology. Their drink menus are all digital on an iPad.  We were seated pretty close to our reservation time and our server Matthew and his helper Ruben were phenomenal! Ruben always made sure my water glass was full throughout the whole meal. Matt was very informative and did not force us to go in any specific direction when choosing what we were going to order. My husband and I did order the tasting menu which far exceeded any and all expectations. We almost didn't order it because of a bad experience we had ordering the tasting menu 2 nights before at another famous chefs restaurant (B&B). I am so glad we did get the whole experience at GR Steak. The courses got better and better as the night went on. The Amuse  Bouche was out of this world. Layers of flavors exploded in my mouth with each bite. The beet salad was a nice refreshing course to prep us for the scallop risotto, which was perfect as well! The scallop lived up to Gordon's expectations. The risotto was the perfect consistency. As for the Wellington, well, it was the star of the show.  The pastry was light and crispy on all sides. The filet was cooked perfectly. We are from the Midwest and know our steak temps. When they say medium rare, that is exactly what it is. The caramelized carrots and potato mash were the perfect compliment to the Wellington. The last course, sticky toffee pudding was to die for! I've never had it before and was a bit doubtful that I would like it, but it was so good I wanted to lick my plate clean!! Paired with the toffee ice cream, it was delicious.  Do not listen to the bad reviews on here. Had I done that, I would have missed out on the perfect evening with my new husband. The food and service was excellent.  Anyone who gave anything less than 5 stars did not know what they were taking about and must have been looking for anything to complain about just to complain. My experience here alone is what  makes me want to come back to Las Vegas. In fact, my husband are planning to come back next year with his parents and uncle to share this experience with them - D&M"

Warm, crispy, a couple of different varieties --- personal fav was the one with pancetta baked in.\n\nStarted off with the pork belly appetizer, which was phenomenal.

The wellington was amazing ---  filet mignon medium rare inside that incredible pastry crust.  I watched a bunch of Youtube clips on how Ramsay makes it, and I almost expected to be disappointed given my insanely high expectations.  Nope.  Surpassed it.  Every bite was moist and flavorful (and again, it's filet mignon, which often has no taste if not done right).\n\nWe were way too full for dessert.  Fantastic meal, great location, friendly servers.

We arrived at 8 and were seated at a great table in the main dining room where we could check out all the action.  After ordering our Whiskeys, we sat back and were amazed with the ambiance.\n\nBright lights, cushion sofas and dark woods adorn the restaurant....very much like a Vegas lounge.....very hip and sexy.\n\nFor our dinner, we ordered the Pork Belly, Gnocchi and Bone-in NY Strip steaks.\nThe Pork Belly was super yummy....very crispy and fatty.  The Gnocchi was pan seared and went great with the Steaks.  The NY Strip Steaks were one of the best that we have ever eaten!  They were prepared for a perfect medium-rare....and tasted like a Kobe Steak.......really!!!!  Not as buttery....but close.\n\nWOW....super, intense Beef flavor with superb marbling.....so satisfying that my Babe did not need to give me a BJ last night! (In theory).\n\nFor desert, we had the Coconut Cake.  The Cake came with a Mango Sherbet...........very tasty and refreshing!\n\nThrow in the great service and it was one of best meals I have ever eaten!\n\nThis is one of the BEST STEAKHOUSES IN THE US AND THE BEST STEAKHOUSE IN LAS VEGAS!\n\nGordon Ramsay.....U ROCK!."

Unfortunately he wasn't there to personally greet our group but I will try not to hold it against him.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor here is a strange mix of Star Trek and Prohibition era boys club. Luckily we were seated in the more private rooms upstairs, which were modestly decorated.\n\nThe focus here is beef. They love it so much they wheel the cuts around on a mirrored cart so they can properly explain that you should be eating a ribeye and nothing else. While it is very important that you get the big ribeye medium rare don't forget about the side dishes. Skip the Bone Marrow, it was slightly overcooked, but do not miss the Fingerling Potatoes or the Shiitake Mushrooms. The mushrooms were the surprise hit of the night! Do your best not to fill up on the fantastic bread service, it will be difficult but the steak is worth the wait.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, if you are looking for a great value match for your steak skip the Cabernet and go right to the Malbec. There are 2-3 bottles under $75 that will go great with your meal and won't break the bank (at least by Vegas standards).\n\n10 of us ate like kings and each had a few drinks. The total came to just over $100 each with tax and tip included. It was very reasonable for the quality of the meat and the fantastic service."

The reason for the 5 stars, other than the food, is because we were sat at our table and there was a  female couple on one side and a male couple on the other who started having an on going \"yelling\" conversation. So we asked to be reseated and we were accomodated ASAP right in front of the kitchen so you can actually see them working in he kitchen and on the pass.\n\n Now for the food and drinks. Wife got the HK Antioxidant and I got the English Garden. She loved her drink. After I took my 1st drink I thought I had made a mistake, I thought it was bad but after more drinks I must say this was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Dont know what it was about that 1st taste.\n\nAs for the food we ordered the HK tasting menu and i must say it was pretty damn good. From the scotch egg amuse to the scallop rissoto, the wellington (only complaint was the pastry got a little soggy) and to top it off the sticky toffee pudding. Everything everyone has wrote regarding this dessert is spot on. We want to go back just to try it again."

            "review": "My two sisters and friends ate here as a get together in Vegas and I have to say that I was skeptical because it was run by a TV personality chef, but that was soon allayed. I should also point out that I worked in a couple of four star restaurants serving from dishwasher to chef. The waiter Charles Narak was without a doubt one of the best professional waiters I have encountered in the past twenty years of so. Having professional staff like him can literally make or break a good place because you never know what kind of attitude the customers bring with them and it can influence it has even if the food is great the dining experience may be ruined and they may not come back. My sister had some dietary restrictions due to allergies and being a polio survivor and other conditions and one of the things she can no longer have is pepper which many restaurants use to make lower salt items. Charles consulted with the chef and they had conversations and not just a scribble on order. The outstanding, the staff was a well-oiled machine with little wasted effort and it did my heart good to see it.\nMy other sister who does not like carrots loved Gordon's recipe that came with the Beef Wellington as did I. across from me a friend had some sort of sea food delight thing that as nearly flawless but tasted better than it looked. I had Wellington back in the nineties when I had money in a famous New York restaurant for $150 and it was about half as good, making the less than $50 price a bargain. In looking at other tables I also saw other people's food items I also wanted, but as watching the staff made the night for me and it did my heart good to just see them in action with no holes in the line-up. I opted for a Belgian pale because I don't normally think wine and Vegas generally belong in the same sentence but if I do return I think I'll look at the list. When I go back I will rectify my only regret of not ordering the Cassolette and compare it with the Paris five star versions. When I go to Vegas there is no doubt that I will return because sadly the quality and the prices are not a good but this is the exception.  If you go there you will not be disappointed in any offering. Go there, go there now."

Their attire wasn't my favorite; but hey, I didn't have to wear it so rock on, Gordon Ramsay Steak staff! The guests' attire was quite varied, even for Las Vegas - everything from jeans and t-shirts to cocktail attire was on display. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant was very unique and sleek. You enter through a cylindrical tube and are immediately dumped into the bar area. Red is vibrantly featured throughout the restaurant, capped off with a custom humongous light fixture that was inspired by the knife strokes of Gordon Ramsay. Our hostess pointed this out while seating us, which I thought was an interesting and fun fact. \n\nAs we passed through the first floor and the front of the second floor, I couldn't help but notice how incredibly loud the restaurant was. Luckily we were seated towards the back of the second floor, so we were able to talk during dinner. \n\nService: Wow. Wow. Wow! Yarmon was hands down one of the best servers we have ever had in any restaurant. He was funny, helpful, extremely nice, knowledgeable, and attentive without being overbearing. I can't say enough nice things about him. He truly enhanced our dining experience! \n\nFood: We each ordered the American rib cap and it was delicious. We shared the mac & cheese and fingerling potatoes as our sides, and both were excellent. The food was outstanding! We asked for recommendations and details on drinks, and again Yarmon delivered. \n\nOverall, this was one of the best meals and dining experiences we have had. It will definitely be added to my list of must-visit restaurants for returns to Vegas!"

I was finally going to eat his food that I've been tasting vicariously for years through his television shows. This was going to be amazing!\n\nAnd it was. It began with our hostess leading us through the beautiful dining room to our table. We were seated on the second floor, which gave us the best view of the entire restaurant. There was also limited seating on this floor, allowing us privacy for a romantic evening. One of my favorite parts was when our waiter rolled out the famous meat trolley displaying all of the different cuts and selections available. Everything looked so good, but I already knew what I wanted: Beef Wellington. It's Ramsay's signature dish that I have been dying to try since the first episode of Hell's Kitchen. Our waiter, who was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, informed us that this dish takes 45 minutes to cook. Understandable since perfection takes a while to attain. ;) So Hubby and I decided on the Gnocchi as an appetizer to enjoy while my steak baked. It was a stunning salad put together with heirloom cherry tomatoes, royal trumpet mushrooms, ib\u00e9rico jam\u00f3n, and mushroom cream. All of the ingredients were so fresh and tasty.\n\nWhen my Beef Wellington finally arrived, I was blown away by how delicious it was. The actual dish is a medium-rare filet that is wrapped in puff pastry and baked. The filet was so savory, it practically melted in my mouth. The puff pastry also gave it a nice hint of crispiness. I can honestly say it is the best steak I have ever had! Definitely worth the wait. Hubby's Kobe Steak and the Potato Pur\u00e9e we shared were both so amazing as well. \n\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any better, our dessert arrived: Sticky Toffee Pudding. It's a classic, British dessert composed of sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee syrup, and brown butter ice cream. The cake was so moist and bursting with toffee goodness. This has easily become my new favorite dessert.\n\nGordon Ramsay Steak excels in every aspect possible. From the beautiful, English decor to the exceptional service and incredible food, the evening was all around perfect. Our next visit cannot come soon enough!"

We had an assortment of desserts with the highlight being the sticky toffee pudding.\n  Service was very good, no complaints except one;  the water glasses are very, very small.

Now on to the food.  To start my meal I had the asparagus soup.  The presentation was beautiful and the soup was quite tasty.  I enjoyed the addition of crab meat to the soup, it was different but very good.  My husband had the Caesar salad to start and he thoroughly enjoyed that as well especially the scotch egg it was served with.  For my entree I had the Beef Wellington and I must say I made the right decision.  The pastry was flaky, the mushrooms were flavorful and the filet was melt in your mouth tender.  It was served with potato pur\u00e9e and roasted root vegetables (carrots and parsnips) both of which were delicious.  My husband had the filet and a side of potato pur\u00e9e which surprisingly needed salt which he had to ask for since it is not provided on the tables (cocky much?). Other than that his steak was perfectly cooked and he said it was packed with flavor which can be difficult to achieve with a filet.  For dessert we shared the chocolate layers. It was quite small but so rich that I'm not sure we could have eaten more of it than there was. The only thing I was slightly displeased with was the bottled raspberry quince iced tea I ordered.  It was delicious but it ended up costing just a dollar less than my husbands beer (7 dollars).  It just seemed like a lot to charge for iced tea, I would have paid that happily for a cocktail or a beer but being pregnant that wasn't an option.  Aside from that the prices were what I expected for a fine dining restaurant (230 dollars with tip for two).  Overall I greatly enjoyed Gordon Ramsay Steak and would return the next time I am in Las Vegas.  Was it the best meal I have ever eaten? Maybe not but right on par with the other fine dining establishments I have eaten at."

Friends are coming to celebrate it July 4th weekend, so this left me on my own and I said 'I am doing this!'.  I was thrilled that via Open Table Steak easily accepted a reservation for 1 (which is not the case everywhere).  \n\nAs others have said the hostess, seating situation, is a bit of train wreck.  As a solo diner they asked if I would be comfortable sitting at the bar, I asked if it was crowed and they said 'Yes packed.'  So I said nope not interested.  They told me to check back in 30 minutes then.  I do exactly that and was seated pretty quickly.  For me, eating alone, it was a great seat... at the base of the stairs, so lots of people watching I loved it!!!  Started with a dirty martini with the sickest olives ever...  blue cheese, bacon and onion YUMMMMMM!  Onto the spring mix salad which was very tasty and light and also my servers suggestion.  As a solo dinner I didn't want to order too much food ya know.  Onto main course...  Rib Cap (my favorite cut of meat), Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts.  Rib cap was delish, although I like Scarpetta's better.  Mac and Cheese was amazing but I have a weakness for pasta with spring peas.  Brussels sprouts were really good, but the pieces of bacon were huge!  Left little room for a lot of sprouts, to the point where when i had eaten all the sprouts there was still half a container of bacon ( I didn't eat the bacon, to me it is there for flavor during the saute process).  Dessert was the sticky pudding that everyone raves about on here and it worth the rave, as is the french press coffee.  All in all the food was a Vegas steak house...   The service was excellent and the finishing touches and details were lovely.  Thank you Matthew (my attentive server) for a great night at a lovely restaurant."

We've already eaten at his Pub and it was fabulous!  \n\nService: The service was excellent and our waiter was very attentive to us...as well as the three other tables right next to us. I also loved how our waiter brought out a whole cart of meat and explained in much detail each cut of meat and how it's prepared. It definitely adds a classy touch. \n\nFood: \n-Smoked beef tartar: Beautiful presentation!!! The homemade potato chips were awesome! Definitely order this...\n-Fried oysters: Again, the presentation was gorgeous. It came with 4 fried oysters with a yummy sauce and seaweed. I just wish there were more! \n-Kobe steak: It was delicious and just melted in my mouth. \n-Beef wellington: Honestly, I wasn't impressed with it. Maybe it's because we were sharing it and the waiter suggested we cut in half so it was brought on two plates? Potato puree was delicious. \n-Baked potato: A huge potato that was velvety smooth! It was covered in cheese and had three pieces of thick bacon.  The waiter brought me extra sour cream! Seriously, this was an amazing potato and I have eaten A LOT of potatoes of all kinds, especially being an avid potato lover.  I would return just to eat the baked potato again! \n-Mac and cheese with truffles: Nothing special, but I love mac and cheese!  Sadly, it had peas in it...and I hate peas! \n-Sticky Toffee pudding: A traditional dessert that is a signature of Gordon Ramsay! And it did not disappoint! It was a creative presentation with a \"stick of butter\" with a knife in it (which was the homemade caramel ice cream), a small container of caramel sauce, and the sticky toffee pudding.  The waiter poured the sauce on the pudding for us. Every bite was heavenly.  Even my husband, who does not really eat dessert, really loved it! I wish there was more ice cream stick! \n-Coffee: The coffee was amazing! It's a special coffee called Las Columb that Gordon orders (according to our waiter).  It came in a french press and 3 alcohol infused chocolate spoons labeled \"A, B, C\".  A= amarretto, C= chamboard...I can't remember B.! But they really added a nice flavor to the coffee! \n\nOverall, my husband would return again next time we're in Vegas. The coffee alone would make the trip worth it!"

I had the Caesar salad to start and it was really nice, the mini scotch egg was a really nice touch. I then had the beef Wellington, it was pretty decent, it did come out a little reader than I would have liked but it was still very good. I finished off with the Chocolate creme pot which was small but very nice. Now for the service, although our server was attentitive I do not appreciate them making people feel stupid which is what ours did to members of our party by correcting when we ordered a cocktail but not by it's given name, it may sound petty but the way the server spoke to us left us all a little shocked. Also when we ordered water we were not given the choice of having tap water just bottled water and just the general demeanor of our wait staff left us feeling disappointed with our visit. We were celebrating a friends birthday and it definitely spoilt the atmosphere of our evening. All in all I would recommend this restaurant but our waiter needs to sort his attitude!"

            "review": "On our last trip to vegas, we booked a 4.30 reservation about a week ahead of time, and they were able to get us in! We also had a large group of 11 and actually kept changing the amount of ppl but they were still pretty accommodating in fitting our group in. You get a plate of different types of bread to snack on before the food arrives. My favourite was the fig pinwheel looking bread. Mmm I wish we asked for more so I could take them to go!\n\nMost people at our table got the beef wellington, as it is one of his signature dish! I also ordered a side of mac and cheese. The beef wellington (for 1) comes in a 8oz fillet, which in my opinion was actually really filling without the sides! If you get the beef wellington (for 2), it is a bit cheaper for the price of 2 people but it is a 6oz fillet if you don't mind eating less. I will probably do that next time! Anyways, the beef wellington was reallyyy good, something that I've never had before. The puff pastry on the outside wasn't soggy and was still a bit flaky on the outside. The proportion of puff pastry to pate was also on point. My fillet was super tender and cut like butter! The only small complaint was that one of my fillet was cooked really rare, which some people may like, but I prefer it more on the medium rare side. Still, it was really good.\n\nThe mac and cheese was delicious. Super rich, super cheesy, the truffle oil was really strong, I recommend splitting a side between a few people because it will really fill you up!\n\nOverall, we all had a really good time! I would add this to your list to eat if you want to do something else besides a buffet in vegas!"

            "review": "My cousins from NY were in town and were excited to try this steak house. 6 of us went on a Tuesday night with reservations. There was no wait, they seated us promptly upstairs. Everyone was dressed nicely, had good demeanor and was happy to serve us. Our waiter, Alex, was wonderful. He was prompt, considerate- serving the ladies first, and made jokes with us. He was personable and helped to make our experience great. \n\nThe bread served was delightful, yet different. I was afraid to try them but each kind had good flavor, was fresh and warm and the butter with volcano salt made it that much better. When the bread was finished, we stacked our plates in the middle of the table, with butter and all. We ended up asking for more bread, but the other waitor guy (not Alex) told us to take our dirty plates back so we can reuse them. What?!\n\nMy aunt and cousin were the only ones to order an appetizer. They ordered a split salad, which consisted of 2 leaves of lettuce and 5 crutons on each plate. I am not exaggerating, it was sad.\n\nI cant remember what kind of meat everyone ordered but everything was delicious. I had the filet, which was my favorite out of the 2 I tasted. The steak was juicy and cooked how I asked. The steak sauces were yummy, but we probably wouldnt have ordered them if we knew it was $7 for a 1/4 cup of each one. $14 for sauce.\n\nOne of my cousins ordered the bone in rib eye. To our surprise, his first bite contained a nice, long strand of hair. The manager came to personally apologize and a new steak was ready in about about 7 minutes. Other than a new steak and the apology, nothing was offered or said about the food, but we didn't ask, either.\n\nThe mac and cheese was delicous and was split between my cousin and I. The loaded baked potato was huge and also split. We had plenty of food, for sure. The sides are goid for 2 people, u less you're starving.\n\nThe wine and beer were good. Coors light had blue mountains, which my dad was happy about. My pink lemonade was pretty crappy, just minute maid. I guess I was expecting a little more high end, like fresh squeezed at least. Our waters were filled occasionally, but often left empty. We were too full for dessert but nothing on the menu sounded appealing, anyway.\n\nAlthough the food was yummy, I think overall you are paying for the name of the restaurant. I suppose it was a good experience to try it out but I've had cheaper  steaks that were just as good from other steakhouses."

            "review": "I really wanted to like Gordon Ramsey Steak.  I went in with high expectations, but left slightly disappointed.  I sat at the bar and ate, as I was traveling for work.  The bartenders were all quite nice, and pleasant.  My order was simple.  A glass of Shiraz, the house salad, and the Beef Wellington.\n\nThe Shiraz was fine.  A good pour by the bartender.  Nothing amazing, but it was good.\n\nThe bread was good.  It was a good start to the meal.  There was a mushroom bread, and olive bread, and one that I couldn't understand.  I actually asked the server to repeat what type of bread it was, but I still didn't get it.\n\nThe Salad was underwhelming.  It had way too much dressing on it, and the the flavors were mediocre.  The lettuce was a bit soggy.\n\nWhat I was expecting to be the star of the meal, The Beef Wellington, was just OK.  The beef was good, but the breading on it didn't do anything special for me.  I felt as though the potatoes and the veggies could have been a little bit more plentiful on the plate.  It was good.  Just not Amazing.\n\nAll in all, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 star rating.  However, one of my rules is that if nobody says \"goodbye\" when i leave, I take off .5 stars.  It is not a very difficult task, and should be a focus of all good restaurants.  In fact, when i left, there were 4 (yes FOUR) Hostesses standing out front.  Not one of them said \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\" to me.  It may be worth a try if you exhausted the other steak places in Vegas.  I may go back next time and try a regular steak instead.  However, for now, I'll say that Gordon Ramesy continues to disappoint me (Pub, Burger place, and now Steak).  Maybe i just need to lower my expectations...."

            "review": "This place started off shaky.  The hostesses here are dressed like cheap (very cheap) working girls who have outfits made of curtains and old wrapping paper.  More horrendously, they act like they are from LA: terrible attitude, doing you a favor by seating you, and genuinely give you a feeling that they are depressed.  You have a job, buck up ladies!\n\nThe wine menu was excellent, but the iPad the use to display their list was filthy.  I was also shoulder checked by a waiter on the way to the bathroom, and there was no apology.  The staff here just looked miserably morose.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nAnyway, there is good news!  The food was quite good.  \n\nRecommend:\n\nOnion Soup - it's a bit different, much sweeter than other onion soups, and less salty.  It's delicious.\n\nKobe Rib Cap Steak - Best cut of meat I've had in Vegas.  Tragically it was slightly overdone from the requested medium rare, but it was still mouth-watering.  Seriously a can't miss.\n\nBeef Wellington - My wife ordered this, and it's definitely a great combo, but when you're dealing with these excellent cuts of meat, I don't see any need to wrap them in phyllo dough.  It's like making a sandwich, and using caviar instead of jam.  \n\nUtilize the sommelier!  He's remarkable, and very warm.  He does not seem suicidal like the LA girls at the entrance.  I mean this when I say it, he's the best I've met in Las Vegas.\n\nLastly, kudos to the chefs.  It's an open kitchen, and you can see them performing at a high level.  Christina, the Hell's Kitchen winner, was open to taking photos and being customer-friendly, but she constantly had one eye on her pans and dishes.  Chef Ramsay had an outstanding influence on her, and you can just tell she has a very bright future in the industry."

            "review": "I am torn between a 2 or 3 star. We had a terrible time getting a reservation. My friend was visiting and her flight was at 6am so she wanted to eat early. We had a 5PM reservation and they said they don't hold reservations. I arrived at 4:40 and there were 4 hostesses gabbing. I walked up to check in and they told me I had to get in line to check in?? I said can't I just check in and wait at the bar. NOPE. They don't open the doors until 5. Seems to me I'd open at 4 and get some cocktail revenue. Plus, wouldn't it be just as easy and more polite to just check me in? But hey, what do I know. They were pretty snooty and I don't know why. Bet they don't make enough to eat there. So I stand in line like an asshole and wait. Then at 5 she yells out who has a reservation. \n\nWe are seated quickly and the waiter brings an iPad with the specialty drinks. There are no prices on the drink menu. The tables are on top of each other NYC style. That would have been OK, if they didn't squeeze 5 people in a 4 top right next to me. The guy was huge and I had to keep myself tucked in like the middle seat on a plane. Luckily they were really nice and I had fun talking to them. \n\nFood-\nBrown butter tortellini $20  it was ok\nBeef Wellington $54 which is the signature dish. You can only get it rare, but it is baked so it isn't bloody for us medium eaters. The Wellington itself was pretty good. I hated the sauce it was floating in. It tasted like something from NASA. The root vegetables were fantastic! All 2 bites of them. \nCreamed spinach $12 was pretty yummy. \nFilet $78 She ordered it medium and I swear it was going to moo. She sent it back and it returned exactly the same. She ended up not eating it and taking it to go\nSticky toffee pudding $14 for dessert. Good. \nFrench press coffee $12 that came with chocolate spoons That was the highlight of the meal. A must have. \nOne Beaujoulais wine $12\nOne antioxidant cocktail $14\n\nPricewise, ridic. It was $210, plus tip. To be squished in, not able to breathe, rude hostesses, and pretentious and annoying assistant waiters. Our waiter was pretty nice and efficient.  So to sum up this rant. Don't bother. I'd way prefer STK, Craft, Nine, Gallaghers, even Outback, actually almost anywhere but here. Gordon needs to show up here and do some swearing. Def a tourist trap. Oh, and one last thing- I hated the music. annoyed the heck out of me."

Picture this, a group of older doctors meet for a reunion at this 'infamous' restaurant with a 7pm reservation--and they show up on time and very hungry. It takes a half hour before these hard working men are seated. Chris serves them a ceaser salad then does not return for an hour. So, inevitably, they summon over a 'manager,' (some overweight half bald man), and voice their complaint(s), to which this man replies, \" this is Gordon Ramsey's restaurant on a Saturday night, what in the \"hell\" do you expect?!!!\" This Oompa Loompa then storms off and it becomes clear this person has, sadly, been drinking on the job, very clear...he trips as he storms off while muttering incoherent phrases and still insists that this group of hungry, geriatric, nice group of people pay for their salads prior to tastefully excusing themselves from this dysfunctional restaurant that they had so looked forward to visiting. When I find out this manager's name, I will update this review. An objective record of his behavior, and the overall experience of that night, will be published on all public websites."

As an appetizer, I ordered a Cesar salad that was quite salty but, still tasty despite the salt. It comes whole leaf so I needed to cut it myself. My date and I ordered a beef Wellington for two and it was overwhelming due to the size. I had ordered the sauce on the side because I have a wine allergy but still wanted to try the sauce. The sauce was excellent and complimented the beef Wellington very nicely. To be honest, my favorite part was the mashed potatoes that came with the Wellington. There must have been a misunderstanding about who wanted a baked potato because we got two when only my boyfriend requested one. According to him, it was delicious. The truffled potatoes were really good but, the toppings could've been more evenly distributed. They lacked flavor on the bottom layers. Overall, the restaurant was good and so was the service. I will probably be going back soon because I'd like to try the fish. As an aside, water is $9 a bottle or something close to that."

Services became stellar from the beginning from out water service by a charming man to being greeted by our warm and engaging server 'Dennis' to give us some highlights and offer us the cocktail 'I-Pad'...so cool.  As we were looking through the cocktails cyber-style, Jeff Eichelburger, the familiar Sommelier if you have dined anywhere nice in Vegas, poured some Champagne for my date and I and we breifly reminissed as we have worked together before.  We were in HEAVEN.\nThe steak cart arrived which offers the evening's choice of cuts on a circular device that looks like the London Eye, each platform in the circle with a mirror behind it to show the marbeling of each steak...jealous yet?\nMy dining companion who is a Pescatarian, opted for the Black Bass and I chose the bone in New York which is a large beautiful nearly 2in thick steak.\nFor starters we shared the fried oysters served in their shells with a lovely creamy cold sauce while I had the seared foie gras (which was like a small steak) and she had the heirloon tomato salad.  We attacked the oysters first and days later are still talking about how unctuous and bright and crisp there were...don't miss them.\nMy foie gras was meatier than you normally would have...less delicate...have to say I loved it being that way and the fruity drizzle de jour was lovely.  C. loved her tomato salad...every bite.  We left nothing including the 4 kinds of bread which range from crostini and foccacia to pinwheels of of swirled flavor that you must forgive me for forgetting....the bread rocks...that's all you need to know.\nEntrees arrived and my steak was done to perfection and C's bass was beautifully presented...as if they filleted the whole fish and kept it in tact without the head but the crispy tail remained..cool.\nThe four sides we selected to accompany:  Sauteed wild mushrooms, sweet creamy corn with a cilantro cream dolloped atop, truffled mac n cheese and creamed spinach...all were delicious steakhouse standby's that were generous and completely wonderful...we had quite a doggy bag at dinner's end.\nDesserts we shared were a warm sticky toffee pudding (decadent) and my chef friend sent out cheesecake with a huge mound of wild strawberry granita and melon and tropical fruit panna cotta...we ate as much as we could and they were all sumptuous!\nWines were paired for us by the aforementioned sommelier and they were  perfect for each course...a Sancerre and Napa Valley Cab.  C'mon...forgettaboutit!\nAll in all I am encouraging all to come explore and be pampered with stellar service and impecable steakhouse fare.  Gordon Ramsay Steak doesn't reinvent the wheel...but makes for a smooth ride to a fabulous meal.  I am not giving demotions for anything...right up to fabulous cappuccino to finish..rich and smooth.\nOne word:  GO!\nYou do not get off with a small bill at the end but dining at a famous chef's Las Vegas restaurant...how could you expect to.  We lived it up and as I said had a full meal in leftovers.  \n\nOne bit of surprise:  No amuse bouche at the beginning and no petit four (garmandise) at the end...didn't seem to matter but just a little surprised for a 'fine dining' steakhouse."
