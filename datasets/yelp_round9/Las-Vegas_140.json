The pizza I got had bacon and pequillo peppers. It was so good! And came out fast. Will definitely be coming back."

            "review": "Scratch one off the personal bookmarks. \n\nBeen meaning to hit up Due Forni for quite some time. Heard about it from my yelp social group who had nothing but good things to say about the place. Highlights seems to focus more on the braised octopus dish that's so tender it's not like any octopus you've ever had. Well...i've had a lot of octopus and i do enjoy octopus...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!!\n\n - Polipo \nThe revered octopus appetizer...The description on the menu honestly does not do this dish ANY justice. How much does the menu description downplay the epicness of this dish? Well it's kinda like calling a nuke a typical explosive...it goes boom things get fucked up u know how it goes...\n\nWhoa where do i start...Okay first impression was the smell that hit me. I was confused at first because it sorta had a fish sauce smell and i was raised around fish sauce. Seeing the greens in the bowl and the smell of fish sauce my mind already determined what this was going to taste like. Not saying this is a bad thing it's just from my prospective my mind was playing tricks on me based on what the senses were collecting. Imagine seeing the lid pulled from a plate of steamed veggies and you smelled steak...kinda like that...confusing\n\nAnyway first bite of a piece of octopus it was just...WOW it's tender. Not too salty and was well balanced with the dressing of the small salad. I gotta be careful with this dish in the future because it may just raise the standard for my future octopus experiences.\n\n - Speck Pizza in a Neapolitan \nVery nice and well balanced. Only thing i hated about it was the difficult of getting enough prosciutto with every bite. Not exactly a pizza friendly ingredient but...what ever..file it under First World Problems. Very balanced and i enjoyed the layers of flavors from the order of toppings, to cheese, to dough. \n\nNoticed half a slice in that there was no sauce. My first reaction to this was 'well...why not?' then i started to realize that adding a sauce would have added another layer of flavor and it was just perfect without it. \n\nApart from the cheese, i was thoroughly impressed with the crust and dough in general. Granted it's not as crispy as i'd like it but it did have a fresh taste to it as well as a decent chewy texture. There was no discarded crusts at this table we ate it all.\n\nOverall the ingredients are just top-notch. I dont know exactly where their cheese comes from but i'd love to brush my teeth with it."

            "review": "Been here a few times and the food is always delicious.  That being said we had the worst service last night.  So bad that I actually wanted to write a review to vent a little bit.  We were seated by the hostess and told our waiter would be right with us.  Well that didn't happen.  The waiter never even glanced in our direction!  He waited on a table that was seated after us and still never looked at us.  The hostess brought us water.  The waiter ignored us.  We flagged down the hostess to tell her we haven't been seen by the waiter yet.  He still never came.  The hostess came and took our drink AND dinner order because yup you guessed it... still no waiter.  BTW, he's still taking care of the table right next to us!  The hostess brings our appetizer.  Still no waiter.  O' the waiter finally shows up and tells us that nobody told him we've been seated!  He was taking care of the table right next to us!!!  The waiter refilled our waters (yeah).  The hostess brought our food to the table.  The waiter showed up and tried to clear plates we weren't done with without asking if we were done and we had to tell him to leave it before he took it away!  When the waiter finally brought the bill he apologized only for being late to our table when we were seated and not the fact that even when he knew we were his table he still provided horrible service.  So sorry we had this experience because the food is always good and if it weren't for the hostess stepping up to the plate and actually taking care of us throughout dinner we probably wouldn't go back again.  Or we would just stick to sitting at the bar."

            "review": "After reading all the great reviews about this place and buying a Groupon or it, I was stoked to finally give it a shot. I love pizza and anywhere I can find good pizza is always a plus. \n\nWe were seated promptly, served our waters and given menus. I was looking around the restaurant and noticed that EVERY SINGLE person was white and that we were the only minorities. So in my head I thought \"great, now they are gonna be racist and not serve us cuz we aren't white.\" Not true at all, we received amazing service!! My friend said I was being a bit paranoid, which may have been true. Our server did take a while to finally take our order, but it was dinner time and the place was packed. \n\nAs an appetizer, we opted for the polpette (turkey meatballs in marinara sauce.) A little too heavy on the breading and not enough turkey meat. I liked the meatballs better at Dom De Marco's, but they don't use turkey so you can't really compare them fairly. It crumbled easily, but the flavors were good. The waiter suggested bread to dip in the marinara sauce. That was an additional $3, but the bread was warm and soft, so I wasn't mad about that. \n\nAs for the pizza, I wanted to be a little more adventerous than a margherita, so we ordered the Bianca al prosciutto, which had ham, caramalized onions and balsamic vinegar. I took one bite and hated it! The crust was soggy, ham was way salty and balsamic vinegar should only be used on salads. My friend thought it was an ok pizza, but only had one slice. We told our server, who then informed the manager of our disappointment. I used to work in the food industry so I know that it's an insult to send back food and I'm by far not a picky eater at all. I'm Filipino and we eat some weird stuff, but I just couldn't do the pizza. The manager offered us a different pizza, but I declined because I was full from the meatballs. The manager was very polite and understanding and said he would take the pizza off the bill. \n\nOur server had a worried look on his face when he offered us dessert. I ordered the chocolate gelato with bacon pieces and he assured me that it was a good choice. The manager who spoke to us earlier personally brought over the dessert and said it was on the house. Nice!!! Our server came back to explain that the bacon can be too overwhelming if eaten alone and to make sure that the spoonful had a good amount of gelato. He was right, but the dessert was delish!!\n\nOur bill with the bread, meatballs and dessert was only $14. Since the service was excellent considering my dislike for the pizza, a hefty tip was deserved. I think I'll just stick to the margherita pizza next time."

            "review": "Now, I loved Settebellos, but lately I have really come around to Due Forni. The Naples-style pizza wars are clearly in full effect here in the Valley and Dui takes it. Neapolitan pizza, done as well as Due and Settebellos do it, really shows how terrible most of what we get handed as \"pizza\" really is. \nSo- the pizzas here (Neapolitan style still my favorite) are just great, taking me back to my first time in Italy. Start simple your first time and then explore the more complex pizzas. The main dishes they prepare in the ovens are really great so don't be afraid to try a special. I have had my pasta be a bit greasy,  but generally excellent.\nLastly, the feel is great- 1960's modern Italy-ish with spaghetti westerns in the background. Good for family dinner, but a bit out of the way for a business lunch.\nRicotta dessert is great as well as the Nutella pizza for the kids."

One of the types of pizza they offer is cooked in a 900 degree oven, making the wait time on your pizza as little as 2 minutes (not kidding). And bonus, the patio is enclosed and heated for those cold days! \n\nFor my veggie friends: order the appetizer gnocchi without bacon, its amazing!"

We went to grab a bite and watch the rest of a football game. \n\nThe meatballs were good. I liked the seasoning they used. My salad was great too. The pizza though, oh man. I wish I could remember which one we had exactly.  Maybe the Bianca...cotto one. I am unsure, but it was very good to me. Its a different type of pizza. I cannot really compare it to other places that have general pizza. Its unique. I do feel that there are better types out there, but it was not bad at all to me. \n\nNow, my favorite part... the WINE! I love wine and their flight deals were exquisite. We ordered two different flights, so 6 different wines, so amazing and a decent price for sure. \n\nThe bartender was very informative about the wines and he was very polite, talkative with us. I like that in a bartender. Very engaging. I really hope he is there the next time I go. \n\nI like this place and I feel very relaxed when I am there."

The $2 charge was not worth the sample. Bottle beer selection was better than most but still pretty weak. We had a beet salad that was pretty good, a caprese panino that was bland, a baked penne that was equally bland and slightly overcooked, and Margherita Neapolitan pizza that was soggy. \n\nOver priced and over rated. If you must try this place then hit it for lunch when at least the prices aren't too bad."

            "review": "My friend Teresa and I came during Restaurant Week and took advantage of their specially-designed prie fixe menu. And thanks to call-in reservations, we were sat immediately.\n\nWe began with two specialty cocktails from their menu, the ROMAN GODDESS and HUMMINGBIRD. The Roman Goddess had fresh blood orange juice, Elderflower liqueur and what I think was Campari? The Hummingbird had Elderflower liqueur and topped with Prosecco. A right amount of sweetness with a little bubble; refreshing. I liked both! The menu is extremely vague and my only peeve was the almost equally vague description offered by our server. I asked what other ingredients were in the cocktails and didn't receive a direct answer, twice. At least the drinks were good!\n\n{ Appetizer }\nSTRACCIATELLA: Fresh Bufala Mozzarella cheese with fresh basil, grape tomatoes, and fried Sopressata. Everything was so flavorful and fresh, very harmonious as a dish. Wish they would put more than two thin slices of Sopressata though!\n\n{ Entr\u00e9e }\nMARGHERITA PIZZA: San Marzano Tomato, Bufala Mozzarella, and Fresh Basil. This pizza featured such simple, but quality ingredients that made it so delicious. SHORT RIB PIZZA: Braised Short Rib, Bufala Mozzarella, Roasted Cremini, and Wild Arugula. The short rib was really good, but as a pizza, not my favorite (also, it was salty). Both were Neopolitan-style (900 degree oven, 90 seconds) and it creates a beautiful and chewy crust on the pizza.\n\n{ Dessert }\nSWEET BUFALA RICOTTA: Toasted Pistachios and Artisanal Honey. Delicious! Light, just enough sweetness, and the pistachios added a necessary texture. BOURBON CARAMEL PANNA COTTA: Vanilla Gelato and Toasted Walnuts. Yummy! I love panna cotta and this did not disappoint. Luckily, it's a relatively small dessert since it's very rich and sweet.\n\nService was fabulous and refreshingly, personal! From the host seating us and calling us by name (from the reservation), checking in on us once during dinner, and again asking us how everything was when we left. Our server was friendly and attentive as well. It was wonderful experience that I am looking forward to having again soon!"

I have been to Italy a few times and Due Forni would fit in well there.(minus the prices)\n-Started out with the Caesar Salad. A nice appetizer portion that was refreshing and satisfying.\n-Next we shared the Chef's platter. A culinary masterpiece. Perfect portion of specialty meats and cheeses with some olives, artichokes and roasted peppers on arugula with fresh bread from the pizza oven...A MUST TRY!!!\n-Finished with two different pizzas. The Due Forni which the home made sausage and the flavor of bacon was memorable. The other pizza we had was the Speck. A dried ham similar to prosciutto. This was the perfect choice which took me back to the flavors i remembered from Italy!\nI will go back but not as often as i would like. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it.

Apparently the only things Du Forni uses to cook are two giant pizza ovens which is a bit nutty but produces delicious results.\n\nObviously their speciality is pizza and they do it right with either thin crust or the traditional neapolitan crust. The authentic italian ingredients and flavors make for truly delicious pizza among other menu items such as the pollipo(octopus salad) and delicious entrees. They also have specials that you can incorporate into pizza if you please. Throw in quick, attentive, knowledgable servers and reasonable prices for Summerlin and this place is a must. \n\nI may be biased here but that doesn't make the food any less delectable. Eat it and don't forget to thank the drop dead sexy sous chef!"

The calamari here strays a bit from the typical breaded variety, as it's baked and served in a tomato-y broth. The table shared the Bucatini as well, but I can see myself ordering it for myself on my next visit; it was delicious!\nWe ended up doing dessert here too, as there was French Toast Bread Pudding (which is, imo, one of the most beautiful string of words in the English language). Served in a still-hot skillet alongside coffee, it was the perfect way to round out a successful first visit.\n\nFood aside, the service here felt warm and accommodating.

            "review": "As far as pizza places in Las Vegas go... I think we can all agree that they are lacking in general.  This restaurant is no different.  The pizza is...OK.  The big claim here is that there are two types of crusts available (although only one size).  Neither is winning any ribbons of excellence, but the choice is nice.  Also, there is a distinct lack of toppings.  Not the choice of toppings, but what arrives on the pizza, especially the sauce.  Sadly, they have confused rustic with sparse.  They seem to be aiming slightly for gourmet but were highly inconsistent among those that arrived at our table.\n\nThe second time I ate there (both were with groupons) I had a steak-dominated salad.  It was very good but really could have used more of the actual salad portion.  But this place isn't really bragging about anything but the pizza....  It doesn't make sense when it seems the other dishes are where the effort lies.\n\nIt is nice that you can choose to eat inside or on their enclosed patio.  This gives them big points in my book.  The first time we ate outside and had one server (lunch) and it was great.  The waitress was great.  The second time we went in and ate inside and had three different servers hovering over us (lunch).  It was overkill and kind of creepy toward the end.  It was odd, but perhaps just a consequence of over-staffing at lunch.\n\nLastly, the decor here is far nicer than the strip mall outer shell lends to.  The spacious bar is very well done and I hope to visit for dinner.  I just won't be ordering the pizza."

The last visit I asked if my friend and I can sit on the left side and we were told that's the family side or whatever.  But they sat us on the left side, against a corner wall.  I made reservations for 9pm but it wasn't busy.  \n\nWe ordered the polipo but it was lazily made this time around, it wasn't as good as my first visit.  There was about three 2 inch legs tossed in the salad, last time they were cut to bite size and seasoned well.  We did the mozarella bar also, that was good and filling so be warned.  The weird part was when we ordered appetizer and pizza I thought the server was going to space out the order but nope, they all came out at once.  Maybe we just had a lazy server that night.  So when the manager placed the pizza down next to the appetizer I had to let him know this doesn't make sense, he agreed and apologized for his server.  He took it away and corrected it, so I don't know if you want to bring that up to your server when you eat here. \n\nOne of the pizzas we had were the bianca prosciutto which was drenched in balsamic.  It sounded good on paper and to me slightly less balsamic would make it better.  The other pizza was the vegetarian, guess who ordered that?  Not me.  But it was good on the harder crust.  If you had the vegetarian on the soft crust the pizza would bend easily and you'd probably lose some of the toppings on your lap.\n\nMy favorites are still the Tartufo and Due Forni.   Maybe I should quit experimenting with the other pies since they don't compare to these two for me. \n\nThey have outdoor patio seating and the inside still has that nice comfort vibe.  The right side is the bar area with TVs and the actual restaurant bar.  They have some of my favorite wines and beer, the triple karmeliet is what I order every time."

The crust was bready, but not in a bad, raw dough kind of way, while the bottom was a tad crispy. All of the ingredients had a fresh taste. The garlic bread on the appetizer menu may have been the best I've ever had! It was so fluffy, not greasy and heavy like most. Our server was knowledgeable about everything we asked him about on the menu, he even made suggestions based on our likes and dislikes. I will say the drinks are a bit overpriced. My husband ordered bourbon (Bulleit) their selection was lacking. I really wanted a sweet white wine, but was advised that what they had probably wouldn't suit my fancy. No biggie, there's a bunch of mixed drinks to chose from. \nThere was a slight mishap with our dinner, but nothing we were worried about.

            "review": "I went here with three friends. We kept it simple: a bottle of wine and three pizzas. Each pizza was great, and none of us could agree on which was the best. The three we ordered were: Due Forni (Neapolitan), Bianca al Prosciutto Cotto (Roman), and the Tartufo (Neapolitan). My only knock I have is that the Neapolitan pies were a bit soggy in the middle. Other than that, all of the pies were bursting with flavor. The Tartufo may be a bit rich if you do not mix it up with some other selections. The service was great, as two different managers came by to check on us, and both had honest opinions and helpful recommendations. Our server was a tad pushy on up-selling, but as someone in the game, I see where he is coming from. The atmosphere was satisfactory. But this place is about one thing first and foremost, and that is churning out two distinct styles of Italian pizzas, and they do that exceptionally well."

I had part of the mozzarella bar with pesto and part of the chefs platter for appetizers. I then had a margarita pizza and tried the short ribs. The pizza was bland and the sauce had no flavor. The ribs were good but I only got a bite. Then we moved onto dessert and got the chocolate pizza. It had good flavor but was nearly impossible to eat. I guess I don't like their pizza crust. I make better crust at home. Their crust has no flavor. Ill give it another try in a couple weeks to see if my opinion changes. \n\nTheir server and everyone else was very friendly. The service from the kitchen was horrible! How long does it take to make two pizzas and a chefs platter that isn't cooked! We arrived at noon and didn't end up leaving until 2!! Too long for lunch"

Nice airy patio dining area - enclosed or open depending on weather. Loved the polipo (octopus) dish, so tender. The gnocchi are very interesting, more semolina based, with a smoky pancetta sauce.

No atmosphere whatsoever and no smell of pizza cooking in their due forni (two ovens). There is nothing on the table, no salt, black pepper, no bread or olive oil is given.\n\nWe ordered the Caesar salad which was ok. Reminded us of pre made salad you get in the supermarket. Very bland, needed black pepper. The speck pizza sounded great on the menu, but it was hardly that. We had it roman style and we could hardly cut through the crust and to pick up the slice and biting into it was a disaster. The prosciutto was so much that it all came off of the entire slice in one huge bite, leaving you with a  few mushrooms and dates on a basically a cracker. My husband's wine was corked and he sent it back. They apologized and gave him another glass, but we were turned off after all of this. Service was attentive, but scripted and slightly annoying. Didn't feel genuine. \n\nBill was expensive - $36 for one glass of wine, salad and one pizza, particularly for substandard food. Needless to say, we won't be back."

Nice looking place, seems to be an upscale pizza place.  The hostess took our drink and food and we wondered if there are any servers here.  We noticed that the pizza on the menu does not indicate a size, but we figure that hopefully, one pizza is enough for two people, especially at $17, so we ordered the Due Forni.  It came out in less than 5 minutes, and I have to tell you that it was AWFUL! Not  to mention, the pizza was TINY!  Only about 10\", definitely not enough for two people without anything else and wow, expensive for $17!!! The crust around the edges was BURNED black, the crust on the bottom fell apart as the \"tomatoes\" on it was basically tomato juice and my favorite part.........the meat toppings were ICE COLD.  Not room temp cold, but ice cold!  I guess they should cook the pizza for more than 90 seconds next time but somehow not burn the edges.  No one came over to check on us, no drink refills, etc. I would have sent this pizza mess back.  So, we finally ask for the check by the hostess, and with disgust, we paid the bill.  Finally, she asked us how everything was as we were walking out and I nicely shared this very bad service and food experience.  She apologized and brought the manager over to us as we were leaving.  He apologized and invited us in another time to try it again.  I always want to give the benefit of a doubt, especially with all of you Yelpers telling me that this pizza is actually good, so will try again and hope for a much better experience but honestly, I do not have high expectations.  Still looking for good pizza in LV."

As good as it gets!!\n\nTerri R and I were planning our next meal together and when she found out that I haven't had a good pizza in at least 3 years, she gave me a choice of 3 different places out here.  Not knowing where to go (remember I haven't had a good pizza in awhile), Terri suggested Due Forni.\n\nWhen it comes to pizza in general, you have your branded commercialized choices (i.e. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc), NY Style, Chicago deep dish, and the authentic stuff.  Due Forni is the authentic stuff for sure.\n\nTheir easy one page menu, descriptions of the pizzas, and the pictures from other Yelpers immediately reminded me of my last visit in Italy.  I even knew what to expect; a thin crusted, a little runny, and a very tasty pizza that wasn't overwhelmingly saucy. If I got anything different, I would be disappointed.  \n\nWe chose the Quattro Formaggi which consisted bufala mozzarella (cheese from water buffalo milk), ricotta, parmesan, and fontina fontal (cheese from cow milk).  Your crust choices are Napoletana (cooked in their 900 degree oven, result is a chewy crust with crispy outside) or their Romana (cooked in their 500 degree oven result is a thin and crispy pizza).  We got the Napoletana and it was simply delicious.  The pizza was just what I expected and exactly what I've experienced in Italy itself.  The inside decor, seating, and colors even reminded me of some restaurants in Firenze.\n\nService was great and the waitress took the time to give me, since I am the noob here, a detailed description of everything on the menu.  She also reminded us that we can add any type of topping on our pizza of choice.  Authentic pizza without the European prices equals a perfect a deal. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with Due Forni if authentic pizza is your thing.  If you enjoy the Americanized branded pizza, Chicago Style or New York Style, then Due Forni may or might not be for you.  But if you ever experienced a pizza the way it's suppose to be made and loved it, then Due Forni is a can't miss, a must try, and as good as it gets.  Visit again or bookmark it, you can' go wrong.\n\nPS: Thanks Terri R.  Pizza slump cured!!!"

We were instantly greeted by Katherine, who introduced herself as our server for the evening. She gave a brief description of the night's specials. The diver scallops and oxtail special was quite tempting, but we had a tsste for napolean style pizza. We started with the Panzanella salad, which was served swiftly. The description didn't excite, but boy was I impressed and wanting for more. We tried the Maiale Bolognese at Katherine's recommendation. The pizza was made to perfection and the pork was so tender, it melted in my mouth. I kept noticing a wooden board being served to several tables with bread that looked delicious. Katherine told us that it was part of the mozzarella bar. A definite must try next visit. We finished the night with the Sweet Ricotta. Again, something I would not normally order, but bf was taking charge of the ordering tonight. The desert was delightful. It looked like ice cream, but it was not as cold. The honey added a perfect sweetness and paired well with the salty pistachios. The service was A1 from start to finish. Even on our way out, staff held the door for us and wished us well. Due Forni,  you have it ALL right!"

Today's meat was pork cheeks that was rich and tender. Italian food doesn't usually make me say \"Wow,\" but this dish did. It's a little pricy at $17 for one serving, but it seems to be the going rate these days at other Italian places as well for far less grade of lasagna. \n\nWhen my 4 year old broke her water glass, she felt bad.

            "review": "Went here on date night when we cashed in our coin jar ($104!).  We were super excited and immediately loved the ambiance.  The beer and wine selection was great and the servers were all nice.  We started with the panzanella.  Honestly, not really a panzanella.  It's a salad with a lot of croutons, panzanella is supposed to be dressed so that it starts to soften up a bit.  It was a good salad and we enjoyed it but panzanella it was not.  Then we had the mozerella, straciatelli style.  My favorite part of the meal.  It was like the inside of a buratta mozerella, extremely gooey and delicious.  Plus it comes with basically a fresh baked pizza dough to slather it on.  We got it with the artichokes which were kind of  boring and bland, but I didn't care because the mozerella was so good.\n\nNext we ordered the gnocchi.  It is semolina gnocchi so if you are used to light fluffy gnocchi this is not what you are looking for.  It was tasty, not super interesting, and very heavy.  Next we ordered the Neopolitan style pizza with ham, fontina and carmelized onion.  The flavors were good and the crust was nice but for a relatively small pizza, the crust was rather large with all the toppings gathering in the center.  Made for some tasty first couple of bites and some boring last few bites.  Plus the pizza wasn't very good heated up the next day.  \n\nWe had a good meal, it was fun, but the end of the meal we were left with a semi bad taste in our mouth.  The server, a few times through the night tried to sell us some wine and beer that he liked.  I thought he was genuinely impressed with these products and he never really said the exact names of the product so I wasn't sure how much things were going to cost but I didn't imagine that he was selling the most expensive glass of wine to me without explaining that that's what it was.  I didn't say anything but when you think you are drinking about $15 of wine and end up being charged for $40, it's a little unsettling.  I guess I need to remember that not all servers are truly looking out for the best interest of the guest.  (especially since I told him I really didn't want a chardonnay and that's what he insisted on me having.)  Too bad, I don't know if we will plan on going back there, not that the food wasn't good, there are a lot of other places I would rather go."

My husband arrived and sat at the table and the second he arrived the waiter asked if we were ready to order. My husband did not even look at the menu yet. When I said we need a moment, instead what we got was no attention at all, and we had to flag down another waitress to help us because our waiter was too busy. There were 2 waiters for about 10 tables full of people and they did not seem to be able to handle it. \n\nOn to the food, we ordered the beet salad (great taste but not enough arugula. Its nice to have a bite of arugula with every bite of beet, but if you do that then you have about half a plate of beets left with no arugula. The Tartufo pizza was excellent (but pricey $20.95). Our meal was big enough to share if you are not that hungry. \n\nThe service was lacking here, we had to flag down the waiter for our bill, water, to ask for more arugula, and they did not come and ask how the food was once.

So instead of four of us splitting two RW menu deals, none of us ordered off that menu so no money went to charity which was the whole point of going back.  In addition, the short rib pizza was on the RW menu but they would not allow us to order that pizza unless we did the RW menu including all three courses which we could not share.

I mean, Settebello has everything; great location, supreme Pizza and great service, our loyalty runs deep and strong.\n\nHowever, the need for exploration trumps loyalty (and we really wanted to see how good the Pizza really is).  We started convincing ourselves that since it was Summerlin, it wasn't cheating, we had to go since we were 'Food Bloggers', we needed to branch out and explore possibilities, we can't be tied downright now, no it's not you..it's me.... really... Sheepishly and incognito, we snuck over to the other side of town to scope out the competition.\n\nAnd we were ready to hate this place, how dare they even try to make pizzas in this town when there's Settebello's? We turned the corner and found a full parking lot, a good sign.  The facade was your usual non-descript Vegas dessert beige with little adornment except for the signage.  An enlarged, covered seating area laid empty, due to the hot summer heat.  I was already committing myself to be unimpressed..\n\nAs it turned out, the inside revealed a beautiful restaurant; the design modern minimal, stylish with all the current fixtures du jour, but still casual enough to feel comfortable...I was really impressed with the entry service; the Maitre'D was impeccable, congenial and polite and really set the experience on a very high note (remembering my name and repeating throughout the meal)\n\nThe restaurant is divided into two sections and area with a Bar designated for Adults, and a main Dining Room area that includes families.  I thought that was a nice touch and very in tune with their customer demographic.  I was really starting to enjoy this place!!! \n\nAs for cocktails, a light summer drink on the menu that had caught our eye was the Hummingbird: \nSt.Germain Elderflower liqueur + Prosecco + Club Soda.  The floral fragrance of Elderflower quenched our thirst, while the dry, bubbly counterpart left a refreshing finish!  \n\nWhat Due Forni had that differentiated themselves from other Pizzerias was their Mozarella Bar: with several choices of cheese and add ons like Roasted Tomatoes and Basil Pesto, it was hard not to fall in love...\n\nWe ordered the Classic Mozarella + Taggiasca Olives + Roasted Red Peppers with oven fresh Bread.  Man, was the Bread good!!! The soft creamy texture of Mozarella alone is orgasmic, but spreading the liquid cheese all over Bread makes it close to Nirvana (the place, not the band....that wouldn't particularly pleasant)... Oh, and the sides are a nice touch.\n\nThe Pizza selection at Due Forni, compressed and distinguished to a T, you had two style choices for each Pizza: Pizza Napoletana, a traditional crust bread with a chewy bite, and Pizza Romana, a thinner wafer like crispy cracker, each pizza cooked in a different oven (thus the name: Due Forni - two ovens).\n\nAnd as the main event approached, the anticipation was palpable!  my palms started to sweat, could this be better than I expected? We were advised to order the signature Due Forni: San Marzano Tomatoes+Bufala Mozzarella+House Made Sausage+Nueske's Bacon+Pequillo Peppers, our helpful server gently pointed us out to choose the Neopolitan style with this order.  On a side note, some of the Pizzas are white (no Tomatoes) so be sure to ask before ordering so that you're not surprised when it comes out different than you expected.\n\nAnd when the Pizza came out, it was beautiful!  The proportions of toppings with the bubbly bread was visually magnificent.  And with our first bite, immediately the Home made Sausage stole the show!  I could have just that forever.  The Pizza itself, well it was different than Settebello's, the chewy crust was  for sure softer and fluffy, it all comes down to personal taste at this point, because I thought the Pizza was pretty fabulous!!! \n\nWe had a great dining experience at Due Forni, the service was excellent; our serve was ever so elegant and thoughtful from start to finish, we couldn't have imagined that they would exceed their expectations...  By all definitions, Due Forni has won us over, we loved the drinks and appetizers, would love to try more that they have to offer, and also try a Pizza Romana in a different style. In the end, we will always have our favorite, but now we have another reason to hop on over to the other side for a great time!!\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\nFood:               4\nAmbience:       4\nService:          5"

As much as I thought I was going to love this place, I have to say that I was sadly mistaken.\n\nLet's start with the service.  Our waitress was friendly but probably annoyed once she realized we weren't going to be spending the big bucks like a lot of the other patrons of this restaurant.  She tried so hard to upsell me to get a glass of wine that once she discounted the price I finally caved.  I got it more or less so that she would quit asking.  Other than that, she was friendly enough and attentive.\n\nMy husband and I had thought about going the one appetizer and one pizza route (to not be pigs), but when I saw that there weren't any vegetarian appetizers we decided to just get two pizzas.  We ordered the Margherita Roman style (thin and crispy) and the Quattro Formaggi Neapolitan style (chewy crust).\n\nOur pizzas came out quickly and looked really good, but after a few bites I wasn't very impressed.  For starters, I'm not sure if it's the cheese or if they add olive oil, but our pizzas were dripping in grease.  The Roman style was a little too crispy for me (and I love thin crust) and the Neapolitan was soggy in the middle.  The flavors of the Margherita were good, but the Quattro Formaggi could have used a little less cheese and maybe some type of sauce to break up the flavor.\n\nDespite thinking we were going to leave full and with leftovers, we ended up eating it all and had room for more.\n\nWhile the two ovens is an interesting concept, there are other places I'd rather get a pizza that cost less, and more importantly, tastes better."

            "review": "Hospitality looks to be a fundamental aspect of their business, because my friend and I got fantastic service from entry to departure. We entered the building to find no one at the host podium, but the bartender greeted us. Not too long after, we were not only greeted by one but two people before being guided to our table. Brief introduction of who our server would be, water filled, and suggestions were made. Ivan, our server, was attentive yet knew when lay back. It reminds me of a fine dining atmosphere without the over the top prices.\n\nWe began our meal with the Pulpette ($9.95). An order of these turkey meatballs came with six golf ball size pieces. The meat was tender and moist, but nothing spectacular. The San Marzano tomato sauce was the opposite. It was my favorite part, making me wish I had bread to sop it up. Instead I just used the spoon. I shared a little before the rest went into my mouth.\n \nThe proof is in the crust. As my least favorite part of a slice of pizza, it tends to be the first portion to be devoured. Although I still ate my pizza backwards, the crust was completely enjoyable. We got two pizzas made Neapolitan style. If I must eat crust, it better be chewy instead of thin and cracker like. The Tartufo ($20.95) is pricey, but justifiable after the first bite. Well maybe fifth, since I eat mine crust first. The egg that is broken and scrambled at the table adds a sense of showmanship that was appreciated. The Bianca De Proscuitto Cotto ($14.95) was my friends favorite. The ham and onion combo was nice, but the balsamic was unnoticeable. When it was time to divide leftovers, there was no mix and match, we just went for our preferences. The good thing about Due Forni is that they do have pizzas for any palate. \n\nIf you saved room for dessert, definitely get their signature Sweetened Ricotta($6.95). Thing of the filling of a cannoli in a cup. The creamy cheese is sweetened with layers of honey and sprinkled with toasted pistachios. Decadence without chocolate. Who knew that was even possible."

Due Forni came up on my Yelp with good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe arrived late, around 9:40pm (they close at 10pm) but the host and sole waiter were as sweet as ever. I did not feel rushed in the slightest, but did try to be conscientious because I can only imagine how annoying it is to wait around on people when all you want to do is go home after a long day.\n\nOur order:\n\n-Beet salad\n-Buffala mozzerella with roasted tomatoes\n-Due Forni Neopolitan crust pizza\n-Speck Roman crust pizza\n\nYum! Everything was very tasty. My favorite was the buffala mozz with roasted tomatoes. The mozz was creamy and beautiful, so good.\n\nThe beet salad and pizzas were all very good, but my only complaint was that the speck pizza was a bit soggy in the center. Perhaps it wasn't cooked all the way through? When I picked up a slice from the pizza plate to move it to my single serving plate the crust didn't hold up, it started to slip downward and the toppings began their slow slide down until I rushed the slice over to my plate. However, the taste was fresh and I really did enjoy the meal.\n\nService was excellent, especially considering we were there after closing and there was only one other pair of people in the restaurant (they seemed to be regulars/friends of the waiter). Their wine selection look varied, I would love to come back and try some wines next time."

I say this because I know the restaurant business and the hardship a low review takes on the ownership, so I rarely write negative reviews. But - wow.., my meal last night was bad. Let's start with the pizza... All I can say, is stay away from the Roman pizza. It is \"thin\", kind of, but very very chewy. Not exactly an attribute you would praise or wish for with your pizza. On top of that the chefs heaped a mountain of cheese... it was terrible. The pizza look closer to something coming out of Chuck E. Cheese, then an upscale eatery. The chefs quite literally don't know what they're doing when it comes to pizza. I discovered one of their main problems when leaving. They keep their ovens floor temperatures at 150 to 200\u00b0. What that means is it's not hot enough to cook pizzas properly. It's too cold. The dough has to sit in the ovens a long time, hence drying it out. A legitimate pizza oven floor has to be between 400-800 degrees, depending upon the style. We kept our at 650 for Roman and Neapolitan styles. Secondly, in pizza, less is more. My advise is to get skilled guys in the kitchen who know Pizza and dedicate one of their ovens to doing it right. Everything else was meah. Last time for me."

The mozzarella is \"mozzarella di bufala\" or water buffalo mozzarella brought in directly from the capital of mozzarella - Campania! You absolutely MUST get the mozzarella ball (get it plain with a side of prosciutto - the taste is so incredible by itself without any of the extra toppings they offer). The pizzas come in two different crusts (roman and Neapolitan). Neapolitan is traditional Italian pizza preparation. Fabulous! There are two wood fire ovens that bake the pizzas and they were also imported from Italy.\n\nDue Forni is off-Strip located in a small corner in Summerlin and is a must go! It's my absolutely most favorite restaurant in Vegas and not just for the food but also for the service.

Molly was kind enough to make reservations for us because some reviews mention that it was an absolute must. That was not the case. The restaurant was about 3/4 empty. \n\nIt is a very elegant restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. They were patient with us while we waited for out fourth person to arrive. In the meantime I opted for a Moretti beer, he brought me a Hefeweizen (about $3 more). I can't speculate on whether this was intentional or a simple oversight, but it still annoyed me. We started off with a Capraccio appetizer (thin sliced prime beef, arugula, pine nuts, parmesan, cremini mushrooms, black truffle) - for $11.95 it did nothing for me. It actually was fairly tasteless even though I was hungry.\n\nWe then opted to share three pizzas --Due Forni, Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto, and Prosciutto E Rucola. That was roughly $50 worth of pizza alone. Had it been as amazing as people rave it to be I would not have minded this price tag, but it was not. The neapolitan crust was still too thin and hard without too much flavor. Everyone had piles of crust left on their plates and that says a lot. When Molly and I go to Settebello for our neapolitan pizza fix, you can bet your life there will not be a drop of that pizza left. \n\nFor the price, this place just isn't worth it. The service was fine, the food was adequate but overpriced, and I would not go out of my way to dine here again."

When I noted they were participating in Restaurant Week 2013 I knew this would be my time to go since it is in a completely different side of town from where I live. \n\nThere were some pros and cons to my experience which leads to my decision of rewarding the A-OK rating. I mean, was it terrible? No. Was it great? No. So I have to go halfway.\n\nPros: \n\n- Delicious Sweet Bufala Ricotta - complete with toasted pistachios and artisanal honey. Honestly my dessert was the best part of my meal. It was savory with a bit of sweet and the perfect portion for a dessert to end your meal. If anything, I'd come back specifically to have this dessert item.\n\n- The restaurant dutifully upheld RW menu and brought my friend and I everything we ordered. The waiter was bland, but not discriminate against us when we informed him we would be dining on the RW menu (I've had this experience at other places). \n\n- Although service was indeed slow and our waiter was incredibly scripted and boring he did not push wine or an upgrade of our meals, which I was afraid of since I have noted in other reviews patrons felt as though they were being upsold during their whole meal, which is annoying, of course.\n\n- My friend and I dined outside on their patio which is always a nice alternative if it's available and not 100 degrees outside.\n\nCons:\n\n- Insalata with mixed greens, artichokes and olives was underwhelming and I had to spit out two pieces of artichokes that had the hard exterior still on them.\n\n- Oven Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and Spring Onions. I could not stomach the onions, one bite and I knew they were not being eaten. Maybe it's just my personal preference. The potatoes were the star of the dish. I might as well have just asked for a plate of starch, rather than having the chicken, which albeit had an interesting flavor, was so small I couldn't believe I was done with it and still hungry. Also, I can make better tasting chicken in my own kitchen. A lot better.\n\n- Service as stated above was bland and seemed extremely rehearsed. \n\n- Menus are paper and placed in front of you during the entirety of your meal. Perhaps to remind you just how much you are paying for your authentically mediocre Italian food. Paper menus are silly and honestly a slap in the face to most people who believe in being enviro friendly. What is so hard about laminating and reusing?\n\nLastly...\n\nSo I did not have the pizza, which is their forte, of course, but I was quite disappointed in my experience. Also, I noted the chicken I had was not even on the actual menu. It seemed odd to me - did they just make up this dish for RW and slap it on the dinner menu, or is perhaps on the lunch menu? Either way, it's an odd thing in my opinion.\n\nWould I return? Only if I was specifically invited by someone. I would never return on my own volition."

Its bar appears quite inviting. The enclosed patio with very large windows is nice, though facing only the relatively quiet parking lot by S. Town Center Dr. The menu is the same for both lunch and dinner; its prices a bit high for lunch, especially the wines, but OK for dinner.\n\nIt offers two kinds of crust for pizzas. My wife and I tried the thin/crispy type with speck. It had a rugged presentation, but its PROSCIUTTO and crust were delicious in every bite. The Caeser's salad was also excellent. Our glasses of red wine ($12.95/glass) were excellent but a bit too pricey [Wine prices vary from $8-$15/glass for average wines, and $20-$50/glass for the more exotic].\n\nWe were there in a late weekday afternoon, thus, only a few tables of guests there. Our attentive, friendly server told us that the restaurant got busy usually after 6pm.\n- No, Due Forni does not offer special \"Happy Hour\", but does offer $5/glass of selected wines from 5-7pm, as well as \"Wine Sampling\" at 20%discount per glass.\n\nWe finished our meals before 6:30pm that evening, so we did NOT see any \"Happy Hour Type\" of crowd typically swarming at popular Roy's, Kona Grill, or Gordon Biersch around 3-7pm. The manager came over to ask us, quite sincerely, how we enjoyed our dinner - a very nice touch. We liked that. Yes, we plan to give Due Forni another try some weekends, when there will be a larger crowd.\n\nIn Short:\n- If you like good pizzas, nice but slightly more expensive wines, and QUIETER ambience, say, for a late lunch/early dinner, then Due Forni is worth a try. But, if you prefer a more exciting (happily noisier) atmosphere of the happy hour with good food/drinks, then there are other better places than Due Forni.\n\nPeterskis, Mar 2012"

I kept thinking what is wrong with this joint? My pizza is soggy!  But then I came across an article on Serious Eats about a recent trip to Italy.  \n\nApparently, Neapolitan pizzas are really meant to be eaten wet.  Yes, WET. There are 2 types of crusts served here in Due Forni - Roman and Neapolitan.  We ordered the prosciutto one in Roman crust, and the meat pizza in Neapolitan crust.  The tomato sauce in the latter order really consumes the thin crust of the Neapolitan pizza, thus making it wet and soggy.  Maybe I need to be serenaded by the Italian coast and culture before I really get into this stuff.  In the meantime, I'll stick to my dry pizza or the other items on the Due Forni menu."

Don't get the anchovies unless you are serious about anchovies.\n\nThe great thing about this place is they have two different types of pizza, which is rare for gourmet pizza restaurants.  They have pizza ovens for both Roma and Neapolitan.  Figure out which one you like before you go.  Roma is thinner crust, kind of like Grimaldi's but not as greasy.  Neapolitan is thicker crust, like Settebello.  We prefer Grimaldi's so we went with the Roma Due Forni pizza ($15.95) and it was really, really good!  It comes with tomato, mozzarella, sausage, bacon, and pequillo peppers, which are roasted red peppers.  The mozzarella had a good, slightly smoky flavor and the bacon and sausage were delicious.\n\nThey offer Moretti on tap ($5.95/glass) and have a good variety of bottled beers.  They also offer all wines by the glass and have an enomatic machine behind the bar.  Our red wine was served warm so I think the enomatic machines are reserved for the more expensive wines.  Some of their wines cost $50 a glass.  We had the Educated Guess Cabernet ($13.95/glass) and the Suri Barbera ($11.95).  Very good wines but I just wish they were served at the right temperature - slightly cool.\n\nThe dessert menu is pretty cool (see pic) and they have a chocolate pizza that I would like to try.  We had the tiramisu gelato and it was very delicious.\n\nThey are open until 11pm on the weekends, which is pretty late for Summerlin.  We usually don't make it out until 9pm to eat so it's nice to eat somewhere that isn't trying to close while we are eating.\n\nI'm so happy this place opened in Summerlin and I can't wait to come back!"

I love the Sofia Loren art, and the unique gangster kelidescope art they have in there. It's beautiful and the pizza makes me miss Naples. It's a bit pricey but very good.

Wanted to tell us about the specials and the mozzarella bar, told him we weren' t interested, but he kept going.  I didn't want tiger shrimp on my pizza, and what is exactly  on a mozzarella bar?.  He brought out three pizzas instead of two because he was not paying attention to anything we said.  We let it slide and tasted all three.  A four cheese dealy, and thick and thin crust Margherita pizza. Got both styles of pizza.  The thin crust was ok.  I'll say about a C minus.  The thick crust was tasteless.  The crust had no taste, no yeast, sauce was some kind of undrained tomato that made my New York Style pizza watery and soggy.  Imported tomatoes are great but you have to drain the liquid off them.  You would be miles ahead using one of the California tomato products which actually has some flavor.  Waiter asked us what we thought of the pizza and we told him it wasn't good, he ignored our comments.  This place knows nothing about making a real New York style pizza.  I can't believe the good reviews.  The crust needs some longer working times to develop some flavor.  It is great you have good ovens, but get some ingredients with some flavor."

Last time we went though we had a horrible experience.. I ordered the chef special for the night which was Scallops. I love ordering their specials from time to time if I don't feel like pizza and they are always very delicious. This time though that wasn't the case - the scallops were horrible, only barely seared on just one side and tasted sour and undercooked. I cut one in the middle even though it didn't really look appealing and when I tasted it, I was really disappointed. The waitress saw my face and asked if everything is ok, to which I explained to her the scallops were undercooked and tasted bad and she apologetically took them back. The manager/host or whoever the new guy was at the door came to our table a minute later  to \"apologize\" by LECTURING me and rudely explaining to me how scallops are cooked and how they need to be undercooked and so on and if I wanted them cooked more that what they were, he can't guarantee their texture and they will be gummy. He seriously talked to me in such a demeaning manner, like I have never ever tasted a scallop in my life and I have no idea what I am talking about by sending those back. He wouldn't even let me say a word to explain myself. Of course he offered me to order something else and was trying to sound nice but the tone he spoke to me with was overall very disrespectful. I love scallops, I eat scallops often, I have had them in restaurants in LA, NY and many other places - point is I know what scallops should taste like and I know what a perfectly cooked scallop is - those just weren't, if I am paying $28 for that dish I expect them to at least be seared on both sides! I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, I was going to just order something else, but the rudeness of this person (who I have never seen there before) was so appalling to my husband and I, that we will never return to Due Forni again because of it. Being so called regular customers, as we live close to the place, and getting treated in such way for no reason, we have no willing to go back there ever again.. Food is good but customer service lacks big time!"

Basically, you don't have to worry about finding a sitter to eat somewhere good and nice for the family. It's also a place to frequent for date night. They have a bar, good for watching sports if it's that season. Very laid back and very romantic (if that's what you're looking for as well)...very great find. The food is just awesome, we've had the lentil soup, lasagna (made daily, in house), caesar salad, and some of the specials are just to die for. The coffees are delicious and the desserts to pair with are also made in house. It's all in all a great Italian place in Vegas. Thank goodness!!! Will keep coming back for more :)"

It's creamy, cheesy, smooth. \n\nThe unsung hero on the menu is the carpaccio, stuffed with arugula and pine nuts, drizzled with a truffle vinaigrette. A must order while you are there.

Due Forni is a Pizza & Wine restaurant that is very quaint and trendy at the same time.  The ambiance is light and relaxed.\n\nOn our first try here, my husband and I were on \"date night,\" in other words, \"sans enfants.\"  We started with the Chef's Platter of meats and cheeses.  We were very impressed to hear the server reciting every item on the platter with ease, from how she pronounced it (well, what do I know, I'm not Italian) to knowing the origin of each item.  Pretty good!  We commented on our journey we once had to Henderson (no, not a region of Italy, just the other side of Las Vegas) to Valley Cheese & Wine, in which we had sought out some specialty meats.  Surprisingly, the server knew what we were talking about and suggested we try  their selection!  It's always good to know that your server is well-versed with his/her menu.  PLUS!\n\nThe pizza was amazing!  Melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Roman crust or Neopolitan crust, your choice!  What really stood out, in my opinion, was their Panzanella Salad, made with arugula, onion, tomato, toasted pistachios, etc. with a light balsamic vinaigrette!  Just the way I like it!  The other stand-out-in-the-crowd item came from their dessert menu!  Lord Have Mercy!  You must try their Sweet Bufala Ricotta, rich ricotta with honey and pistachios!  Good Lord!  It was amazing!\n\nLastly, we took a stab at Due Forni a second night, this time with the children.  Gotta admit, unless your kids have a worldly palate, they won't be as impressed as the adults are.  They did enjoy the Chef's Platter, but as a suggestion for pizza?  Stick to the Due Forni pizza, tomato, mozzarella, sausage and bacon (all exquisite ingredients), minus the oregano and peppers.\n\nGreat place!!!  Will definitely return for more!!!"

Alex andBobby are incredible.  The food is beyond fabulous - creative but not complicated, not intimidating.  Great wines - both in price point and selection - giving diners a choice of Reserve wines or a less expensive experience. We need both and they have accomplished that.  I had a table of 10 ladies last night and they accomodated us giving us a choice to sit inside or their terrace-like outdoor area.  Pizzas, Wine, Appetizers and accomodating a Vegan guest in our group was great. Alex and Bobby visited our table and checked in to be sure we were wanting for nothing and Chelsea is teh sweetest and incredibly professional yet easy-going.  The wait staff in general is great.

            "review": "500 or 900 degrees.  60 or 180 seconds.  Yup, great Italian style pizza.\n\nThe pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.\n\nTried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive \"stuff\" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).\n\nIt's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect \"octopussy\" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).\n\nThe mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.\n\n50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  \n\nBottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time."

Bill $160, so $38 each person with tip.\n\nThe panzanela was our least favorite.  The bread/croutons were too crunchy and the cheap tomatoes a dissapointment.\n\nThe gnocchi was perfect! lovely, truffly, and al dente.\n\nThe carpaccio was very good, nice portion, pretty presentation but needed salt.\n\nThe tartufo pizza was excellent in theory but, once again, just needed salt.  \n\nThe prosciutto pizza was great and the balsamic added a sweet surprise.

We had this one the crispier roman style.  It was very good.\n\nAs a non-dessert lover, even I thought the chocolate pizza was magical! One chocolate pizza is easily enough for 6 people. it was perfectly decadent without being too rich or too sweet.\n\nNice selection of wines by the glass for fair prices.

Two styles of pizza crusts to select from. I personally enjoyed the chewy Neapolitan crusted Tartufo pizza, but I can live without the raw egg that is broken at the table and spread over the pizza, which didn't have sufficient heat to cook the scrambled egg.  But it is still safe, it is pasteurized.\n\nThe surprising part of the meal was the organic Mint Camomile tea that is on the 'dessert' menu. I had it with my pizza and it basically cleanses my palette after every sip.\n\nIf you enjoy watching games (football and basketball) with a few good slices of pizza, this is a good spot to drop by.\n\nAlex, I believe is the owner or manager was very nice. He spoke to every customer that I could see seated on the side of the restaurant I was sitting at (bar side).  It definitely had a positive contribution to the dining experience.\n\nAnd if that is not enough to convince you to check out Due Forni, I overheard that MOF Chef Jean Philippe (of Jean Philippe Patisserie) also drops in for pizza from time to time.

Fabulous selection of wines and most are offered by the glass. This is certainly a new favorite of ours."

We all wanted water and got terrible service after the waiter found out we weren't buying alcohol. He told the birthday girl she was talking too much, didn't split our check after we asked him to, and instead of asking if we wanted boxes he just pointed at a friend's plate and raised his arms like \"what's this?\" She had to say \"What?\" to get him to use his words and ask if she needed a box. Then, to top it all off, he brought out an ice cream for the birthday girl without asking and then charged us $3 for it. Food was decent, not the best pizza I've ever had. If you want something good in Vegas go to Grimaldis. When we asked the manager about the waiter he said \"He's one of our best.\""

But, occasionally, I just don't give a f*** and head out for a night of Italian pain.\n\nThe location of Due Forni is really great.  Right off the 215, in a quiet strip mall, it's an easily accessible location.  I was really surprised though because the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night.  Good sign.\n\nWe ordered the Quattro Formaggio (yeah, I hate myself) with Roman-style crust (thin and crispy crust) and the Bianca pizza with Neapolitan-style crust (thick and chewy).  To dull the pain, I ordered a bottle of a grenache/syrah wine mix called Cashmere ($48).   I really enjoyed the Quattro Formaggio, the simple flavors of the mozzarella, ricotta, etc, went really well with the light Roman crust.  I would definitely order this again (well, not for awhile...).   I wasn't a big fan of the Bianca pizza, however.  The heaps of salty ham overwhelmed the taste--not a good thing since it was slightly cold and tasted like pre-packaged deli ham.  Bleck. Both pizzas came out lightning quick, though!  Don't worry about a long wait here.\n\nBecause we were slightly drunk (yup, drank the whole bottle), we decided to order the chocolate pizza for dessert.  Talk about a decadent, rich ending to a meal.  Neapolitan crust, chocolate, nutella, hazelnuts, strawberries, vanilla gelato, etc.  Very good, but I wouldn't recommend it if you order pizza as an entree.  I felt very crust overloaded.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it more than Settebello.  Pizza, obviously, isn't my thing but I think this place is one of the better spots in town.  I'll definitely go back for some wine!"

I'm sure I'm missing out on part of the magic of this restaurant by not ordering the egg-goo pizza, so perhaps this would be a 5 star review if egg-goo was my thing. \n\nThe decor of this place was awesome - chic, clean, and modern. Service was quick and polite. We ate here on our lunch break so I appreciate good service when I'm trying to dine quickly. \n\nWe settled on the gnocchi and the prosciutto pizza . The gnocchi wasn't dense like most gnocchi I'm used to, but was utterly fabulous. The bacon was divine and the peas and light sauce were perfect. YUM. \n\nThe pizza was pretty damn good, but I like Settebello FAR better. The crust was very similar, but I found the cheese/topping ratio at Due to be off. I didn't really taste any cheese, but my pizza was covered in tons and tons of proscuitto and salad. I will say, ounce for ounce, you're getting a ton more meat on the pizza here, but it was in obnoxiously huge pieces there were impossible to eat without cutting. But then cutting the meat ended up making the entire pizza fall apart. Settebello just holds together better. Also, I love the Carbonara pizza at Settebello featuring a FULLY COOKED (and goo free egg!). Additionally, the prices at Settebello are much better. I felt like I was eating good pizza dough with tons of meat and salad on it here. The balsalmic on it was tasty, but just added to my meat salad feeling I was getting. Truffle oil and more cheese would have served this pizza well ! \n\nI do love Italian style pies, so I'm pleased to have another option in Vegas. Don't miss the fabulous pasta, this place has many exciting options besides pizza !"

It was okay but it had been opened 2 days ago- I don't drink 2 day old wine anywhere especially at $19/ glass. When the bill came they tried to charge me $3.99 for the taste and said the taste is 20% of the cost of the glass. Just ridiculous prices and protocols for a restaurant.

With a very modern decor and relaxed ambiance, this restaurant is ideal for gathering with friends and enjoying great food.\n\nWe started our evening by ordering their cold cuts appetizer and it was an excellent way to start out. The Chef's platters is filled with imported meats, cheeses and olives that you can enjoy over one wine while you are waiting for the pizza. If up I are into heavier appetizers, definitely get the gnocchi and you will enjoy one of the most unique marriages of flavors I have had-- black truffle cream and nueske's bacon. AMAZING. \n\nThere are two kinds of pizza you can order at this place, Neapolitan (slightly thicker, chewy and pliable) and Roman (crispy and crackly texture) and you cannot go wrong with either. We had the Tartufo, prosciutto e rucola, and the Bianca and they were all great. There were six of us and the three pizzas along with the chef's platter and the gnocchi were more than enough for all of us. \n\nLastly, please SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT. You must try their chocolate-bacon ice cream. The most decadent and scrumptious desert I have had in a while.\n\nIf you are out looking for a dining experience but do not want to drop hundreds of dollars you have got to visit Duo Forni!"

Groupon had a $10 for $20 deal so I thought \"what the heck\" met my friend Kevin P so we could do a yelp challenge. As we entered, the host asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and the place was pretty empty so I thought it was a bizarre question. So he replied \"oh well,  is it ok if we seat you on the bar side\" sure that's fine, until he sat us down in a very small 2 person table next to the window away from everybody, not sure if he thought we needed alone time or what, but there were plenty of other tables open. Awkward.\nWe started out with the Polipo app, which was the highlight of the meal, braised mediterranean octopus, arugula, pequillo peppers, taggiasca, mint vinaigrette. Absolutely phenomenal. For our pizza, you have a choice of Roman style or Neopolitan style, we went with Margherita pizza, Neo style. Again, this is hard for me to review because I just can't get into the \"wet\" crust, all the ingredients slide off when you're eating! If I came back, I think I would try the Roman style and try out the Enomatic wine dispensers, they have 40 different wines to try, which I could pair with that octupus app.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIf there is one thing that drives me nuts when I'm eating is when servers whisk away your plates the minute you set your utensil down. I like to take my time and enjoy my meal and if I'm having a good conversation, I don't like to be made to feel I'm being rushed. Table of 4 was sharing the salad, the salad bowl clearly had more in it and the server starts picking up our plates and actually picked up the salad bowl and then asks if we are done, actually, no we are not! This continued through our entire dinner, we barely finished our pizza and our dishes were being picked up. I cannot stand this! Please do not rush me! Ugh"

            "review": "I've been looking for a place that cracks an egg over pizza. Thanks to Debbie N's review, that place is Due Forni.\n\nThe name means Two Ovens in Italian. When I walked in, the owner showed me the two ovens, which are both on full display from the dining area. (I just assumed he's the owner because he seemed very welcoming and grateful that I chose his establishment). On this occasion, I was just there to pick up a take-out order, but the interior is very classy. There is a bar area on one side with a dining area on the other.\n\nWe decided to go with the Tartufo because it's the one with the over easy baked egg. The other ingredients are black truffle, parmesan crema, fontina fontal, and roasted cremini. I didn't realize it at the time, but based on the menu description, I guess we had the Neapolitan style pizza. Each of their pizzas can be ordered Neapolitan or Roman. That's why they need two ovens. The Neapolitan is baked at 900 degrees for no more than 90 seconds whereas the Roman is baked in a 500-degree oven for 3 minutes.\n\nAlthough the egg was extremely undercooked, the pizza was oh so good. It is certainly an expensive pizza if you look at the size versus the price ($20.95 for the Tartufo), but the ingredients were high quality and the crust was cooked to perfection. We paired that up with a Tricolore salad, consisting of farmers market greens, taggiasca olives, artichokes, avocado, and white balsamic. Wow was this salad excellent. Great flavor throughout with (again) high quality ingredients and a reasonable price ($9.95).\n\nIt's not in my area of town, but I would return to Due Forni in two heartbeats."

            "review": "This place has really gone downhill since it opened.\n\nMy first few visits, I was so excited to have a pizza place of this caliber on my side of town. I was worried that it was never very busy and am surprised it has lasted this long. Even though everyone talks about how great it is, there never seems to be anyone there.\n\nWe got busy with life and stopped going for awhile. When we returned, we were as happy as ever with our pizzas but also got the branzino, which I normally love but thought it was just OK.\n\nWith the current pizza invasion, we hadn't been to Due Forni for nearly a year. I like the nearby Settebello better and was even considering Custom Built Pizza but wasn't in the mood for the fast food setting. Since there was a Groupon, we decided to save and give Due Forni another chance. Normally I don't buy Groupons for places I've been before, but I was having a hard time justifying the price when there are other spots nearby that I like better. This visit was a mistake.\n\nFirst, the host, who I think is the owner or manager, seemed annoyed that we wanted to sit inside. Whatever, he seated us. Our waiter was very strange and had a confusing attitude. I ordered root beer, and he didn't bother to tell me it was bottled. This wasn't a huge issue, but every restaurant I've ever been to that only offers bottled root beer has made sure to inform me of this before serving.\n\nNext, we ordered a Roman margherita and Neapolitan tacchino pizza. He upsold us on a salad, but I was hoping he would do that anyway so no problem. After taking our order, he returned promptly and said, \"Roman margherita and Neapolitan tacchino, right?\" I confirmed this.\n\nSoon after, he was breaking the egg on my husband's pizza. Tacchino pizza has no egg, so I re-read the menu and saw he had served tartufo, not tacchino. I told my husband, so he asked the waiter who then whispered in his ear, \"Sir, I heard tartufo.\" My husband said he had ordered tacchino, and the waiter told him to just eat this one, and if he doesn't like it he'll replace it. WTF?\n\nFirst of all, I know he didn't hear \"tartufo\" because he came back and repeated \"tacchino.\" So either he forgot between our table and the kitchen, or the kitchen messed up and he didn't want to deal with it. Second, how can you tell a customer to just eat what you gave them? These two pizzas have nothing in common! Plus this pizza is $4 more, so now he was charging us more for something we didn't want. My husband's a pushover and likes both kinds of pizza, so he just went along with it. I didn't argue because I'm on medication that could make me lash out at anyone who gives me the wrong response.\n\nMy margherita pizza was disappointing as well. It tasted like it was made on a Saltine. While they always describe the Roman pizza crust as being cracker-like, I've never had it actually taste like a cracker.\n\nUnhappy with the food and service, I doubt I'll be returning here. I find it outrageous that a waiter would tell someone to \"just eat\" his mistake without offering to replace it with the correct order in addition to charging the higher price. I used to go all out to get people to come to Due Forni, but this goofball along with the higher prices for lower quality food have put an end to that."

The beet salad was amazing! So fresh & full of flavor. We also ordered the prosciutto E Rucola pizza & the Brasato pizza. Hands down the Brasato pizza was the best pizza I have ever had & it is very unique. I could not get enough. We also had the Panino Dolce for dessert. Amazing!!!! Amazing!!! Amazing!!! Everything was sooooo on point. On top of it all the waiter gave us above & beyond fantastic service! Thank you so much Danny/Daniel for everything. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Due Forni for an absolutely fantastic night. Cheers to feeding my belly!"

            "review": "This is a solid choice for a nice, romantic night out. The restaurant has a pleasant interior as well as outdoor seating area without being excessive . The servers give you the old fashioned respectful treatment, which always feels nice. I came here with my girlfriend during restaurant week for dinner and we enjoyed the nice weather outside.\n\nWe ordered the stracciatella and the Insalata. The straciatella was a rather unusual dish I must say. I know that mozzarella and tomato salad is a thing that they do out there in Italy, but the addition of ricotta cheese and the melding of the cheeses into some sort of strange paste was a bit unusual. My insalata kept it simple-- greens and tasty olives with a traditional dressing.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the spring chicken and I went with the rib pizza. The pizza was, if anything, a bit too meaty. Lots of yummy arugula and some mushrooms as well. I think I would have liked some marinara sauce with it to weaken the meaty taste of the ribs, but it still tasted pretty decent the way it was made (and the leftover slice I heated the next day in the oven was actually quite nice). Very filling for a Neapolitan style pizza. The chicken was solid-- tender potatoes, seasoned vegetables, and tender, salty chicken. We gobbled it all up without a problem.\n\nDessert really impressed me. I had the pistaccio ricotta with honey and my girlfriend had the Bourbon caramel panna cotta. Both are EXCELLENT creations. I think the ricotta is a better choice for the more sophisticated palate-- the ricotta is only lightly sweetened and this is complimented by the saltiness of the pistachio and the drizzled honey to create a most pleasurable display of complimentary tastes on the tongue. The panna cotta is a better choice for one with a stronger sweet tooth. The combination of the gelato and the caramel in each bite creates a most soothing sensation of creaminess to balance the unfathomable sweetness of the caramel. Both desserts were promptly and quickly finished by us, the patrons. \n\nPleasing atmosphere, good service, and a decent amount of wine for under $10 make this place a winner and well worth a return visit."

Thank goodness my kids love cheese pizza anyway. My husband and I ordered wine, salad, and an appetizer plate which was perfect for us. For dessert, we enjoyed the chocolate pizza but I LOVED the honey ricotta dessert.....YUMMY! (I would have been happy w/wine and the ricotta ;))\nAnyway, the prices are high but the quality of the food, wine, and ambiance backs it up. I will be coming back with just the hubbie and taking a taxi so that we can have more vino. This would make a wonderful \"let's mellow out and have some wine with good food\" date night.\nAs for bringing the kids, the pre-dinner rush is a better time if you have to bring them, but beware of the limited choices. Importantly,  I would like to stress that the staff DID make us and our kids feel welcome. But if you can find a babysitter, you may be able to relax more."

The atmosphere is cozy, minimalist and modern, which is a nice departure from your usual Italian-immitation pizza places.  \n\nThe menu isn't huge but it's definitely well-rounded and offers a lot of unusual, interesting choices.  Here's what we tried:\n\nSpinach salad ($8.95) -- this was the perfect size for 2 people to share.  The spinach greens were fresh and came loaded with great toppings like walnuts, orange segments, garbanzo beans and salty slices of ricotta salata cheese-- an interesting and delicious combo of flavors :)\n\nDue Forni pizza ($15.95) -- SUPER good!! You have a choice of pizza crust style and we chose the Neapolitan, which is thin and chewy.  The crust actually reminded me of pizza I had in Italy, which is very hard to find! The toppings were fabulous too -- homemade sausage, fresh mozzarella, bacon and roasted red peppers.  FYI, the pizza was only 12-14\" in diameter so if you're super hungry, you should probably order your own pizza.  \n\nRicotta drizzled w/ Honey & Toasted Pistacios ($6.95) -- this dessert was creamy and delicious and felt decadent without being too heavy.  The ricotta was incredibly smooth, not-too-sweet and when combined with the honey and pistacios...WOW!! \n\nOverall I was really impressed with this place -- the food was wonderful and uses high-quality ingredients that make the dishes special & memorable.  Service was great throughout; our server was very knowledgeable, polite and attentive.  If you're bored with your usual \"we'll have a large pepperoni\" pizza night, definitely check this place out :) Personally, I can't wait to go back!!"

We got the thin crust \"Due Forni\" and Caesar salad. The pizza was amazing- housemade sausage, thin bacon, Marzano tomatoes, basil and the right amount of olive oil drizzle around the no-toppings zone of the crust. I didn't drink due to work but there were a lot of wines available and a good selection of bourbons that I saw. \nI asked if there were other locations and found out that there was - in Austin. The owner must have a teleporter to stay on top of both. \nI think this is a well done, well thought out place and will be back again if we are in that area of Vegas for business.

It was fresh and the dressing was light but delicious.  We shared a pizza that had spinach and sausage.  The crust was thick but not dense. It was yummy!  \n\nI ended the meal with some chocolate ice cream sprinkled with freshly cooked bacon. The idea was creative but I thought the bacon should have been cooked longer. I was expecting crispy...crunchy bacon instead I ended up with chewy little bacon bits. If they made the bacon crispier they could even go a step further and cover the whole ice cream with crunchy peices of bacon . It would be like fried ice cream!"

I think everything is way overpriced and they are probably trying to make up for the high rent in this pricey area. \n\nThe place was somewhat crowded on 1/10/13 but still plenty of tables available. When the host seated us he asked us for our last name which I thought was an odd thing to ask? The waitress appeared to be new as she fumbled over some of the menu items but she was polite and prompt. \n\nThe first thing I didn't like was their offering of table water-- the emphasis on bottled water and no of course the water was not listed on the menu. We should have just asked for ice water which of course was not even offered. We got suckered into a bottle of spring water. \n\nWe ordered a salad that was amazing, not sure the name but it had pistachios mmm mm! Boyfriend and I prefer to order gluten free when it is available and were thrilled to see it was an option for a pizza crust. No allergies but would prefer when it is an option over wheat or white flour. We ordered gluten free for $4.95 extra... as a margarita pizza. \n\nWhile I appreciate the restaurant's effort to offer a gluten free option... I have to admit.. it is REALLY really bad. Just.Don't.Order.It. Do yourself a favor and go to Sammy's if you want gluten free pizza.\n\nWe told the waitress how bad the GF pizza was and she took it back and let us order a different pizza. We went with a four cheese regular crust. (dont recall actual name of pizza but I think it was a white pizza and we asked they substitute the white sauce for red pizza sauce with fresh mozzarella and basil). It was good but nothing amazing. I appreciated them getting us another pizza without any hassle. \n\nBoyfriend wanted dessert so the waitress brought out mini cannolli which was not officially on the menu. I didn't have any, but he didn't like them, they were too crispy. Then again no cannoli has impressed him since he had one fresh in NY. Will we be back, probably not. It was not worth the money in my opinion."

The ingredients are fresh and the decor nice, but the service is bad and the food is disappointing.  The ingredients are fresh and high-quality, but the preparation seems lacking.\n\nFood:  Last time, we had the soft mozzarella board, which was decent.  Not amazing, but not bad.  My girlfriend had Polipo (octopus) which she said was fantastic.  Not chewy at all, and very tasty.  We shared a Tartufo pizza (mushroom and truffle), which I cannot recommend.  The truffles and mushrooms were overwhelming.  Too much of a good thing is not good.  This preparation has a raw egg over the top, which is supposed to get cooked by the heat of the fresh pizza.  Ours ended up runny and raw.    \n\nTonight, we had D's Bees and the Boston for cocktails.  There were 6 specialty cocktails and we had two, but they tasted suspiciously similar.  Neither were good and we left them both untouched.  Management took one off the bill, which was very nice.  For our meal, we had beef carpaccio (which is a unique preparation of the dish), which my girlfriend thought was light and \"interesting\", but entirely forgettable.  We ordered a Margherita pizza, again with great ingredients and cooked well...but bland.  The branzino is one of the best pieces of fish I have had, but after eating it, I was hungry.  The Manager recommended desserts, chocolate gelato w/ bacon on top and ricotta gelato with pistaccios on top.  The ricotta was bland and decidedly \"not worth the calories\".  The chocolate gelato was good, but nothing special.  \n\nThe General Manager was so enthusiastic and friendly, that he got in the way of our server, who was already undertrained and left alone to flounder.  He was so busy \"bullshitting\" that he failed to notice that he was talking to unhappy customers.  It was a classic example of thinking about what you are saying, rather than observing or listening.  And this was after he noticed we did not like our drinks.  When we talked about the drinks, instead of apologizing and moving on, he defended the cocktails and made as if we were at fault.  He did, on a positive note, bring over a type of gin that he thought we should sample.  It was interesting, but had little to do with our meal.  Honestly, this place is so close to what I want a restaurant to be, that it hurts.  By being so close, this failure of a restaurant becomes more frustrating.  \n\nSummary:  I spent $95 for a meal and left hungry and annoyed.  Two strikes and they are out."

I started with the mixed greens with pickled seasonal fruit, which this month is kumquats! Very tasty those kumquats, and they should have more pickled fruits in a salad. That would be awesome!\n\nI also had the Due Forni pizza, Neapolitan style, which is a thicker crust. It was a very good pizza and I liked the bacon more than the sausage on the pizza. There were plenty of toppings, and the red peppers were OK, but hot peppers would be a great option instead! It's a quality pizza, and at $17 I'm not sure I'd come back & get another pizza. I ate half of it, opting to take the rest, but could've finished it all in one sitting no problem. I had a glass of white wine which was good and $5 at Happy Hour. \n\nThe complex this place is in seems like a neighborhood center, which may explain why it wasn't busy. It's not the best location.

First, off the staff is excellent and knowledgeable about the wine and the food.  In my opinion dining out for specialty pizza should be set up for sharing and having tastes of many items.  Unfortunately, I find the menu lacking in small plate / appetizer options to accompany the pizza for group dining, unless you want heavy cheeses and meats to on the side of pizza, it doesn't flow.    \n\nAdditionally, I think the Kitchen has made a rookie mistake with the San Marzano Tomatoes.  Imported Italian Tomatoes are intended for the purpose that Chef will slice open each tomato, extracting the seeds, then crush, puree or hand squeeze for the base of his sauce. My personal irritations are from the misuse of the product.  The tomatoes are a canned product, meaning they have been processed and are a ready to use base for making a sauce with one's choice of herbs and spices.  The intention is not to serve in place of a fresh tomato.  They are not making pizza sauce but instead serving them raw and unseasoned straight from the can on the pizza.  \n\nWhat a shame when there is so much potential to make a great pizza sauce and really make a name for themselves is the niche business of upscale pizza, especially since they have mastered awesome pizza crust, something that is virtually unheard of in Vegas.  I would give 5 stars to both crust styles they serve."

Totally over cooked and under seasoned. I've never said this before and I doubt I ever will again but I had a better and more reasonably priced branzino on this strip. Shame on me I guess for trying to order fish at a pizza joint."

My boyfriend and I ordered the the Panzanella (arugalla) salad and the Neopolitan style Maiale Bolgnese pizza. The salad had a nice crunch from the ground pistachios, and the tomatoes were sweet, fresh, and juicy. \n\nThe pizza here is definitely not your standard take-out pizza. All of the pizzas here are 12 inches. The dough is light and chewy, and it tasted a slight bit like sourdough. Nevertheless, as a big fan of crust, I gobbled it right down. The pizza was slightly wet when picking it up, but it didn't seep through the crust. You definitely have to use two hands to eat it or use a fork. \n\nOverall, the experience here was pretty good with friendly customer service. Without the Groupon, I think the prices are a bit steep. If they lowered their prices a little, I think I would be more inclined to visit again."

Pizzas are great and with the roman or neopolitan styles everyone gets what they want.  \n\nAdequate wine list as well.\n\nIf you don't like it here, then you are really just expecting way too much for a moderately priced neighborhood restaurant that really has done a great job with service and food and I expect to be around for awhile."

My colleague ordered the pork special which contained both loin and a beautiful looking piece of pork belly - he said it was very good.

Second, we had some sort of cheese platter with various dips, can't recall the name, but what great appetizer. Third, I'd never heard of it and my son, who was in with his family from Brooklyn found it. He thought the pizza was better than the old Queen Pizzaria on Court Street in Brooklyn Heights, where he was raised and raised on pizza and I have always thought Queen was the best. Fourth, we went with his children (4 & 1), who were, and I say this somewhat proudly, remarkably well behaved, and they couldn't have been nicer in accomodating them. Fifth, I'm definitely a regular customer now...try this spot, it's wonderful...and the service couldn't be better.\n\nIf I were to have a criticism, it would be the same as for so many restaurants in Vegas these days: Why is a television necessary?

I had looked at the menu online and we pretty much knew what we were going to order.\n\nFor starters, we shared the appetizer polpette, baked turkey meatballs in tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.  The meatballs were excellent.  They were juicy and the tomato sauce billed on the menu as San Marzano tomato, was also very good.  It made a nice dish for sharing.\n\nThis was the first time in years that we have gotten pizza.  I know that's almost un-American but it's true.  We ordered the quattro fromaggio with bufala mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, and fontina cheeses.  The pizza made 4 large slices and was almost the perfect size for two people.  I had to bite the bullet and finish more than two slices but we all have to make sacrifices.  We ordered it Neapolitan style.  It was a treat!\n\nA little dessert never hurts the ending of a meal and we ordered the sweet bufala mozzarella with honey and pistachio nuts.  A small size but just right for two people.  A nice ending to a good meal.\n\nService was excellent.  Matthew had a good sense of humor and was a top notch server.  I mentioned to one of the owners (?) that the Groupon worked the way they hoped.  It got us in the door and the food will bring us back.  This was a nice change."

It's a small but cool restaurant with bright orange colors & interesting lights hanging from the ceiling with old westerns playing on the tvs around you.\n\nThe pizza is so delicious.  They have 2 different ways of cooking the pizza - one that results in a chewier crust (Neopolitan) & another one that results in a crispy crust (Roman).  I always stick with the Neopolitan Margherita pizza - the combination of the chewy crust, yummy sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese & fresh basil on top makes for the perfect pizza for me.  \n\nI've gotten the lasagna a few times - it changes daily based on the chef's liking & ingredients available.  It's always hot, fresh & fabulous.\n\nI also get the caesar salad on a regular basis which shouldn't be so spectacular because let's be real here...it's a caesar salad BUT the fresh romaine, shaved parmigiano reggiano, herbed croutons, creamy garlic vinaigrette & some fresh ground pepper is so good.  The fresh ingredients they use really make a difference.  \n\nThe drinks I've had so far are decent.  They have a lot of different wines, beers, cocktails & each waiter/waitress is more than happy to suggest the perfect pairing for your meal.  \n\nThe desserts are fabulous - they change their bread pudding flavors & the gelato they pair it with regularly & they've never disappointed me.  We've also had the cannolis which were very good.  Make sure you get yourself a coffee drink before you leave as well!  I get a cappuccino with dessert each time & it's delicious.  Not bitter whatsoever & perfect amount of foam.\n\nCheck out groupon before going because there's usually a deal.  I actually just scored a $25 voucher for $12 - guess I know where I'm headed to dinner tonight!"

Also, the degree of service was very consistent, even with the 6 staff members we had encountered. Thank you.  And please keep it up. \n\nAfter work today, I rushed to make it in time for their happy hour, which ends at 6:30pm - and yes, I made it.  I basically ordered 4 out of the 5 dishes they had available on the HH menu. The first one was the vegetarian flatbread with penne basil, roasted sweet cherry tomatoes, and parmegiano reggiano (the cheese might negate the vegetarian label, though) - very delicious, to say the least.  We also ordered the meatballs, which were quite good; but I wouldn't say they were the best.  Their prosciutto wrapped dates with goat cheese were not as sweet as Firefly's, but might rival it both in quality and as an overall side.  I wanted to order another plate of it, but got full too quickly.  Their oven baked goat cheese dish was very simple, too, with house-made bread and a lightly fried mixture of bacon, goat cheese spread, along with some thinly sliced apricots.  The chef also decided to give us the fifth and final happy hour menu item: the Gnocchi, on the house, which has a bit of a lovely spice, along with their sausage.  I was very surprised that the chef did that.  I guess the chef wanted us to try the whole HH menu, which is a pretty great list.  \n\nI did, however, want to try their oxtail soup that I had read about a few weeks ago.  Sadly, they had removed it from their HH menu.  On a happier note, this led me to check out the other dishes from their regular menu.  We ended up getting the Due Forni pizza with the Roman style crust.  And I have to just thank them for making an amazing concoction of a pizza. The meat, the sauce, whatever was put in there made it so delicious. And the crust - the crust! It was crispy and light, just how it was intended.  After everything I had eaten here, I didn't even feel like disgusting and gross, and regretting what I had eaten.  Perhaps I didn't eat as much as I thought I did or maybe the food just wasn't of the greasy type. \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful experience here.   I cannot wait to try out the rest of their menu."

Good, but not quite mind blowing like I thought it would be!  I had really high expectations for this, but what I got was a mushroomy pizza with a lot of \"juices\" sitting on top...kind of runny and watery, albeit a decent pizza overall.

A very insouciant but very sexy (depending on how much wine you've sipped) modern feel. \n\nI live in Green Valley so although the location is rather far it is literally right off the Town Center exit so not too bad on time. I should probably hit the Flamingo LVAC then take the next exit for pizza here. (: \n\nWe ordered the crudo, carpaccio, prosciutto and caramelized onion pizza roman style, and the chocolate pizza. For two people we were rolling out of there. \n\nVery very delicious. I love my ceviches, pokes, tartares and crudos. This one hit the spot with yummy yummy olives in the mix. \n\nFun take on carpaccio, although I will say the balsamic glaze was used as a decoration and the rolls didn't have much punch to them alone. There wasn't enough of the decorative glaze to sauce up all the pieces adequately. \n\nThe pizza was super delicious. I've never had Roman style, very crunchy.\n\nAnd after all that, they brought out the chocolate pizza. Died and gone to heaven. Perfect balance of chocolates, hazelnut, chewy dough and strawberries. Yum Yum Yum. Do not forget to try this. \n\nNext time I'll certainly try the cheese bar. \n\nDue Forni also has an enomatic wine system, like Hostile Grape and Noras. It's not uncommon in the valley. One of the benefits of this system that many people and establishments underestimate it its preservation of a bottle. On Due Forni's wine BY THE GLASS list you can find prices in the $60 range because the Enomatic system can preserve that bottle for a long enough period of time to sell the entire bottle by the glass. Some people may think it's a ridiculous price, however its about quality. Instead of buying a entire $200plus bottle you can try just a glass. I read a couple reviews on a different site that were really harsh about this and I'm just not sure they understood. Prices of values of wine can also vary greatly from year to year, just because you think you saw a particular estate on sale at Lee's for $30 a bottle doesn't mean Due Fornis is putting the same year/bottling in your glass for $60. Be an educated consumer if you want to throw around complaints like that. \n\nI also am a fan of classic italian cocktails and Italians love their spirits and liquors as well as their wine. Perhaps a larger portfolio of classic italian cocktails and the spirits they require might be a nice addition."

I can here wanting a solid artisanal pie in town for a reasonable price and my expectations were pretty mild. I hadn't heard much about Due Forni so I came in blank, but I was impressed I have to say. \n\nThey have about 8 different pizza options, about half being vegetarian, with either Roman or Neapolitan crust. They have about 4 salads, 5 appetizers, and a few other main dishes as well. Then they have a mozzarella platter for a starter. So pretty limited menu overall but all very good. We had the mozzarella with a few sides and a spinach pizza. Then we had about 4 drinks total. The wine list is nice and reasonably priced. The beer list is actually very good and there's some rare beers on the list from Chicago and the east coast that you definitely won't find around town. In the high end for beer prices but that's what you get in Summerlin and rare imports. \n\nThe server was helpful, on point, and not intrusive at all - just right. The total bill was around $70. I was full, had some nice drinks, and enjoyed my meal. Due For I earned a new customer."

            "review": "3.5 stars. The atmosphere is nice and modern, which I appreciate. The food was very good. 2 of us shared a tri-colore salad and a pizza margarita. We decided to see how they handled the basics on our first trip. The salad was good, top quality ingredients, but maybe a touch overdressed. But since that's really a matter of personal taste, I haven't dinged them for it. The pizza was also great. Nice chewy crust (we had neapolitan style), and like the salad, it's clear they're using top shelf ingredients. \n\nWe both had a beer at the bar while we waited for our table. I had a moretti from the tap, and the keg kicked as the tender poured it, so I only got half a glass. But after they changed the keg they brought me a glass full to the brim. Much appreciated, with service it's the little things that matter! Speaking of, the service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. Although after we were done eating it did take longer to get our check than it took to get the food out. (Because the menu is so simple, the food comes out lightening fast, btw.) The portions aren't huge, so we weren't quite full after splitting a salad and small pizza. So... Dessert! We ordered their dessert which was just whipped ricotta cheese with honey and chopped pistachios. Wow! I didn't expect it to be so good, but I'd recommend it to anyone. Again, as with their entire menu, simple food with great ingredients is all you need!\n\nSo, the reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price. We had two beers, a salad, a simple pizza, and a dessert. I think our bill came to around $50 (incl 20% gratuity). That's probably at least $10-$15 more than we would have spent at Settebello (the only other pizza restaurant in town worth going to). But at Settebello, the salads are much, much larger, and I think the pizzas may be as well. So for the money, I have to say Settebello is the clear winner at this point. Lucky for Due Forni I live on their side of town!!!"

Not that a great 4\" deep pie isn't still wonderful, but not what I crave.\n\nWith that being said, Due Forni pizzas are fantastic.  Top quality fresh ingredients, awesome crust, perfectly cooked every time.  I especially love the margherita pizza.  The basil tastes like it was just picked in the back garden.\n\nI really like the style of this place too.  The modern touches and always some spaghetti western on the TV.  Who would have thought a little Clint Eastwood would compliment fine Italian food so well?\n\nService deserves 5 stars here!  The staff is awesome.  Very friendly and on top of everything.  You'll never need to ask for a refill of your iced tea!  And they keep their distance if the table is in conversation.  I hate \"interrupty\" servers.

Go with the thicker crust (our server suggested it so we did go thicker for the tartufo but since it was our first time there we went thin for the due forni pizza and wish we had not. also another comment i have is the due forni is not as flavorful as the tartufo). Our server upsold us on the sweet bufala riccota dessert (with honey and pistachios) in turn we ordered americanos. See what I am saying? All around smooth and pleasant dining experience. I didn't try any of their wines maybe that is why my opinion is this: Even though everything was great, I don't see myself coming back for a long time.

I recently branched outside of my usual Grimaldi's (Eastern & 215) and tried the Rainbow & 215 Grimaldi's location.  The customer service was terrible, so it was a welcome occurrence that everyone in Due Forni went out of their way to make sure my friend and I were taken care of.  No doubt, it was dead on a Sunday at lunchtime, but still, it was much appreciated.\n\nMy friend and I started with the Due Forni caprese.  This was incredible.  Please see the photo if you don't believe me.  Buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and a spicy sopressata.  Great flavor, just enough spice.  Mozzarella was fresh and yum.\n\nMy friend and I split a bottle of wine - Nero d'Avola.  Good wine, particuarly for the $32 price tag.\n\nShe ordered the Margherita pizza and I ordered the Picante.  We both chose neopolitan style. (Two choices of crust, chewy or crispy).  I had never tried sopressata before, but apparently I'm a huge fan.  The picante pizza also contained the spicy meat and I loved it!  Very good pizza with a spicy kick.  \n\nWould definitely return to Due Forni when I want a change from Grimaldi's."

The waiter was a patient kind person, we had about 12 people that couldn't make up their mind on drinks and asked the same questions over and over again and he answered the questions over and over again.  \n\nWe ordered some appetizers since it was happy hour and they were all good. Some of my colleagues ordered the pizza and it was crispy, thin and full of flavor.\n\nHere are the dishes I tried:\n\nMozzarella Bar with sliced prosciutto, artichoke hearts, creamy mozzarella with their soft chewy bread.  It was really good.  However, since I was sharing the dish, the prosciutto was hard to pull apart, it looked like it was just one big slice of cured meat.  However it was really good.\n\nPolipo (octopus) salad, the octopus was tender and moist.  I would have been happy to have this as my main dish.  One of my co-workers said that if she knew it was octopus, she wouldn't have tried it.  So since she didn't know she said it tasted like perfectly cooked chicken. \n\nPiccante (sopressata) pizza it was completely filled with lots of thinly sliced sopressata (salami) so it was a little too salty for me.  Even though it had some thinly sliced bell peppers, it still did not kill the saltiness.  So once slice was enough for my blood pressure. \n\nPolpette (meatballs) appetizer.  It was flavorful and tasty, a definite must try with their delicious well seasoned marinara sauce. \n\nMargherita pizza was good.  Nothing special that you can't get at another New York style pizza place.  I rather use the $$ for another order of the Polpette (unless you are a vegetarian).\n\nTartufo pizza was very interesting.  It had mushrooms and egg.  All I can say is that it was interesting.  If I had to get this as my entr\u00e9e, I would have regretted it.   \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal and being with my colleagues.  I will definitely take my family here."

Unfortunately, I should have asked more questions of our server prior to ordering. My husband love the prosciutto in the mozzarella bar appetizer. I loved the mozzarella and bread in the same dish.\n\n After that it just went downhill. \n\nI ordered mushroom ravioli and when it came out it looked like someone poured brown gravy all over perfectly good raviolis. I tried it and it was just an overpowering mushroom puree. I mean I really tried to like it. I wasn't going to say anything, but our server, Juan, who was so sincere and tried his best to help us, called me out on it right away. \"You don't like it, do you.\" he said rather than asked me. He immediately offered me another pasta dish. I told him, \"Hey, maybe I should have asked you more questions. I thought I was ordering a basic ravioli with marinara sauce. It's my fault for not asking,\" I said. He looked confused. I said, \"I feel really American right now with expecting kind of a basic Italian dish.\" I even apologized for not liking it because that's how crazy I am.\n\nSo Juan offered for me to try to gnocci with cream sauce that normally comes with bacon. I don't eat pork so we left the bacon off of it. It looked good when he brought it out as my husband was packing up his partially eaten Speck Pizza. My husband loved his pizza by the way. Unfortunately, the gnocchi was so plain it was just not a hit. I felt too bad to say anything to Juan because I could see he was sincerely trying to make it right. He looked like he took it personally that I didn't like the pastas. I even went so far as to let him pack up the remainder of my dish knowing I wasn't going to eat it.\n\nThe atmosphere at Due seemed fun and kind of chi-chi. There were lots of yuppie types sipping wine and cocktails. My husband and I just wanted a romantic, hearty Italian dinner, no frills. It just didn't seem to work out for us tonight.\n\nBut, hey, you win some you lose some. You never know if you'll discover a nice little neighborhood gem unless you experiment. Like I said, my husband loved his prosciutto and his pizza with even more prosciutto on it. I'd stay away from the pastas, thought.\n\nFeeling disappointed. :("

It was just to over the top for a casual pizza restaurant.  It was good, but to me nothing special.  And the wines are absurdly over priced."

There's even an outdoor sitting area when the weather permits. Me and my sister brought her dog and they were totally fine with it.\n\nThe wine selection here is absolutely delish! If you don't know too much about wine, ask your server, they never steer you wrong! I believe the one I was recommended the last time I was here was the Educated Guess Cab. Absolutely delicious! Definitely a wine you'd want to babysit and enjoy! I did! If you're not in the mood for food, they have a bar as well so you can partake in their wine selection or other cocktails.\n\nIf you love good pizza and wine in a semi-elegant atmosphere, this is your place. And semi-elegant is not a slap in the face to this place. It just means you don't have to get all snazzied up to enjoy it if you don't want to. :)"

Worth the price!\n\nAtmosphere 5/5: The atmosphere of the restaurant is modern with some TV hung on the wall. You feel to be in an upscale environment the minute you enter in the restaurant which is great for a restaurant outside the Strip.\n\nFood 5/5: I tried the Carpaccio which is served differently to the regular one we're used to eat. The meat is rolled around some mixed green and nuts. The idea was great and the meat litterally melt in your mouth! We ordered finally 2 different versions of the Pizza, the  Neapolitan and the Romana. The  Neapolitan Pizza has a thicker and more spongious texture while the Romana has a thinner and crispier crust. I would go for the Romana if you're looking for something lighter and tastier. The Speck Pizza is phenomenal and the prosciutto is Delicious! We also had the Due Forni and it was excellent as well.\n\nService 5/5: Service was great even tho the restaurant was quiet empty for a lunch on a Saturday but the waiter was quiet helpful and friendly. He gave us some suggestions as well. \n\nOverall, a great experience for a restaurant outside the Strip. I will be back!"

The cheese was mild, the italian meats were quite good, the only downside was the lack of a cheese knife. Our waitress recommended a wine, that turned out to be fantastic, went great with the platter and later went great with the pizza. The reasons they only get 4 stars are as follows: red wine served in white wine glasses, no cheese knife, and they make their margarita pizza with sauce instead of sliced tomatoes. On the other hand the prices are reasonable for the quality, we felt very welcome, and the dessert pizza may be the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. With just a few small changes this could be the best place I have ever had gourmet pizza."

It was a little odd because it seemed like the pork belly was a big piece of fat. I've had a few different pork belly appetizer dishes from various restaurants and cuisines, but none seemed that fatty. It was smokey as the name states, which I'm usually not really too keen on of smokey meats, but for this, it worked. It was served on a wooden plank with greens and blueberry. Odd combo, but I didn't hate it.\n\nWe also ordered the Due Forni pizza and the Daily Lasagna. The Due Forni pizza was good, but there was some really odd flavor in it that I couldn't make out, and I wasn't crazy about it. However, the Daily Lasagna was top notch. It was a bechamel sauce with sausage inside and CHEEEESSSEE. Wow, that lasagna killed everything else and allowed that visit memorable. Good job Due Forni on that yummy lasagna. I do wonder though, if it says 'Daily Lasagna', does that mean it's different nightly? What if next time I eat there, and order the lasagna, it comes out not as delicious? Hmm....."

I went with a bunch of co-workers for a Christmas lunch and had the opportunity to try 4 different pizzas: margherita, Due Forni, Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto, Piccante.\nThe pizza, the pizza is SO GOOD! And my absolute favorite was the Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto - they just pile on the ham like it's going out of style, a way a pizza should be made. And I definitely can't complain about the others, they were also good, just didn't make the top favorite. I will say that they do have a gluten free crust, but I didn't have a chance to try it. \nWe also had an assortment of the mozzarella bar: you can't go wrong with this. They offer three types of mozzarella and 6 complimentary sides. The Gnocchi - never had such small pieces of gnocchi - cute and delicious!!! \nFor dessert, they served chocolate gelato with bacon and I have to say I love both those things, just not together. And then there was this delicious chocolate, nutella pizza dessert thingy that was to die for. It totally made up for the bacon chocolate gelato for me. \n\nOther things to note:\n- the pizza place is super cute and has a very rustic chic feel to it. \n- What I didn't get to try when I was here was any of the wine. They have quite the selection, and for this wino alone, I'll be going back. (as well as ordering a Bianca Al Proscuitto Cotto pizza)\n- They have a $5 happy hour food menu.

This place is UNIQUE, in that they have TWO pizza ovens, brought in from Italy: a Neapolitan and a Roman! The styles of pizza crusts are completely different. TRY BOTH, but I'll stick mostly to the more traditional Neapolitan.\n\nThey have also been quite good with non-pizza items.\n\nThis time, tho, there were a few misses, thus only 4 stars. WHY DO I ONLY REVIEW WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS! Sigh.\n\nI'll start with the PROS. As I said, the pizzas are stellar. I have to say, of all of the Neapolitan pizzas offered in Las Vegas Valley, this place serves my second favorite crust and topping. (My fave so far? DOCG. A close third place? Settebello.) At their Super Bowl party, earlier this year, their \"lamb chop lollipops\" were INCREDIBLE. Perhaps the best lamb chops I've had in this country. (The best lamb I've ever had? Karoo Lamb, only available in South Africa.)\n\nNow, the CONS, IE the problems yesterday. They have an octopus dish, grilled and served on a salad. The critter was overcooked, so it was tough and not was flavorful as I would have liked it. I didn't say anything, I probably should have. Also, all of their salads can be a little overdressed, but I have to say that the content of the dressings is always spot on. Next up, M thought it rather weird they would serve a cheese bread with the wonderful mozzarella+item platters. I did too, but it didn't ruin it for me. And lastly, WHY do the wines-by-the-glass prices have to be so high? I understand, their wine list is truly astounding (they currently have a GEORGE Pinot Noir by the glass, that's fantastic stuff, and rare to find on a WBTG list), but drinking there is always exorbitant, we ALWAYS wince upon the arrival of the bill. (FOOTNOTE: You can get a TASTE of any wine for 20% of the glass price, so I got to try 2 sips of that GEORGE yesterday. YAY!)\n\nSo I would say, GO HERE. GET PIZZA. I think we've tried every pizza, they are ALL fantastic. Get the lamb chops, if on the menu. Bring extra cash for the drinks. And enjoy."

It is thin and chewy with a crunchy bite.\n \nFor a unique pizza that you cannot get anywhere else is the Tartufo -\nTruffle confetti with a cracked egg and that is spread throughout the pizza.

Brilliant flavor pairings.  For dessert, please try to honey riccotta cheese sprinkled with chopped pistachios.  It's savory, sweet and crunchy!"

            "review": "We've been to Due Forni many times over the last few years. It used to be our go-to pizza place but the last two times we've been, the food has been very bland and the service less than steller. We walked in and asked to sit outdoors but were told a large party had just left and it would be a 30 minite wait because they had to clean and set the outdoor area back up. So we agreed dining inside was better. We were seated in the bar area, at the table right next to the entrance (worst table in the house), despite the dining area being only half full and the tables more interior in the bar area being empty. But we decided to just go with it. About 10 minutes after being seated, we ordered and watched as a party of four came in, requested to sit outside, and were immediately taken outside and seated. WTH?? I was annoyed to say the least but we let it go. \n\nWe ordered the Margarita pizza and penne bolognese. When I've made bolognese at home, the sauce is rich, deep in favor and you know it's hours and hours of labor. This bolognese lacked that depth of flavor and tomatoeyness. The pizza was just plain awful. The crust had no discernable taste. None. I can't help but think they totally forgot to add salt. The sauce, too, was bland and was more like chunks of tomato taken from the can and thrown on the dough as opposed to a real pizza sauce. I don't know what's going on at Due Forni. After giving it another shot given our previous dining disaster, we won't be going back."

            "review": "I have been wanting to try Due Forni for a while so I was glad to finally try it. Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The \"Neapolitan\" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the \"Roman\" had a crust that is thin and crispier. \n\nSince I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the \"Quattro Formaggi\" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni. \n\n**Happy Hour is from 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm 7 days a week**\n Current HH menu: $5\n-Oven Baked Goat Cheese\n-Dates Skewer\n-Meatballs\n-Gnocchi\n-Vegetarian Flat Bread"

You can't go wrong with beets and goat cheese as far as I'm concerned.

            "review": "This rating is 4.5 stars, but I rounded up instead of down since it was my first visit. I've been trying to get my husband to  Due Forni for a month after getting recommendations from friends/colleagues about great local pizza places in Summerlin. I even purchased a Groupon and was finally able to get him to go last night. We had been to other local pizzerias and have been disappointed, hence my husband's reluctance. \n\nWe were both surprised at the location -- Due Forni is about 5-10 minutes away -- an easy drive up the street from us and we had no clue it was so close. Another surprise happened when we walked in the door - seeing a familiar friendly face in Xavier, the manager, who greeted us warmly. He and my husband used to work together, so another plus for Due Forni. \n\nDF's has a nice outdoor patio, however, the wind was picking up, so we decided to eat inside. It has a nice cozy atmosphere, with cool Edison bulbs dangling on the ends of wires from the ceiling and flat screen TVs in the bar and main dining room, playing spaghetti westerns - which I had no idea what they were until Alex told us. Not sure if that's my cup of tea, would be cool to see Sophia Loren movies, or other Italian related movies, like Big Night, that would make a more pleasant back drop than cowboys dying on a flat screen...just my personal opinion.  Could make a diner lose their appetite. And while the lighting was cool, it was a bit dark and there wasn't additional ambient lighting on the table. My husband and I each had to use our cell phones to read the menu, which also doubled as a place mat. \n\nDespite the odd movie selection, the food was fantastic.  My husband and I each had a starter. He had the Beets Salad with basil pesto, arugula, goat cheese, toasted pistachios and fig vincotto. His salad, seemed to be the perfect starter size, whereas my Spinach Salad came out in a huge bowl.  It seemed to be an entire bag of spinach with fresh cherries, roasted walnuts, cabra vino & a light herb vinaigrette for $9.95. It was quite tasty and had some amazing mozzarella bites in it, however, it could've been a bit smaller and the high-sided bowl it was served in was a bit awkward when I wanted to rest my knife and fork between bites. There were a few fresh cherries, which had a nice sweetness to break up the bitterness of the spinach, although I wish there had been a few more, as well as candied walnuts. Instead there were a few roasted walnuts which had fallen to the bottom of the high sided bowl. The bowl was a wide funnel shape, so I had to keep tossing my salad with my knife and fork in order to get the other tidbits which sunk to the bottom of the bowl with bites of spinach. I think if they reduced the spinach salad by a third and served it in a lower bowl, added candied walnuts and a few more cherries to be more in balance with volume of spinach, and also add a few more pieces of mozzarella, it would be perfect.\n\nWhile the salad was good, I didn't want to eat the entire thing so I could save room for my main, which was the Tartufo pizza on Neopolitan crust (recommended by our waiter since the pizza has more substantive toppings). Thee Tartufo was well worth its $20.95 price with its black truffle, parmigiano reggiano crema, fontina fontal, roasted cremini, over easy-baked egg was melt in your mouth good. The cheese was perfectly melted and gooey, the black truffle was delicious and didn't overwhelm the cheese or the roasted mushrooms and the egg was a surprisingly delicious touch. The crust was definitely far better than the pizza crust at Settebellos, which was soggy and wet. The Neopolitan crust at Due Forni was the perfect combination of a light chewy interior with a crispy crunchy exterior. I normally don't eat the crust, but with this pizza, I made an exception since the texture was amazing and was perfect to sop some of the truffle oil on the other slices!  My husband had the Daily Lasagna, which was ham and cheese. Something that I would expect in a sandwich, but not in a lasagna, and while it was good, I probably would've opted for a different meat, like a spicy Italian sausage to balance the creaminess and richness of the cheese. It came out bubbling hot and smelled AH-mazing and the cheese and the b\u00e9chamel was spot on. \n\nWe didn't order dessert, however, Xavier sent out a complimentary bread pudding, which was delicious, but we were both so full from dinner that we only had a few bites. My husband and I both liked their wine list and that all of the wines they serve come by the bottle as well as the glass, which is an unexpected nice touch. The service was fast, the wait staff friendly and the overall experience was enjoyable. I just wish I had taken pictures to post with this review, but we were so hungry and it smelled so good, we didn't even think about taking photos until we were almost done! We'll definitely be back so I'll definitely take pics next time. I want to try the Prosciutto Panino, it sounds delicious."

            "review": "Cibo eccellente! The food was excellent. I was watching a TV program about the history of pizza. They were discussing the roots of pizza as being a thin wood fired oven crust. It looked so good I decided to go on a quest to find pizza Napoletana in Vegas. I found Due Forni (through Yelp) which is about 20-25 minutes from the Hard Rock Hotel and casino. Upon arriving to the restaurant my wife and I were greeted by the host (manager) and seated right away. I knew we were in the right place upon smelling the amazing exotic aromas in the restaurant. The waitress came to the table right away and gave us a full explanation of the menu and wines. She was extremely friendly and helpful (which is rare in restaurants today). They were offering a special on a flight of three wines. The wines were excellent and $35 was a great deal considering one of the wines is about $180 a bottle.\n\nWe started off with Stracciatella (soft and creamy) mozzarella and prosciutto san daniele. WOW! This mozzarella was so creamy and buttery and topped with a little prosciutto, YUM YUM! Next we had the Panzanella salad. This salad was composed of toasted pistachios arugula, onion, tomato with balsamic vinaigrette. An awesome combination of flavors; Intense onion and tomato and then smacked with a toasted pistachio over vinaigrette, yummy! We couldn't decide which pizza to choose but finally agreed on the Due Forni pizza Napoletana style( light chewy/soft crust crispy exterior). This pizza had san marzano tomatos, bufala mozzarella, home made sausage, bacon, and pequillo peppers). Holy smokes! What an incredible pizza. The delicious pizza had a woodsy crust crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. The homemade sausage full bodied flavor, incredible. The combination of all of these ingredients made for one of the best pizzas I have ever had in my life.  I would definitely go back to Du Forni the next time I am in Vegas. The service was excellent, the ambiance was great, and most of all the food was AWESOME!"

            "review": "We live a mile from Settebello & LUV it (but the owner's always been a little off-putting).\nGood foodie friends were in town, and recommended Due Forni, so off the 4 of us went (2 red-blooded Italian-American sauce-snobs in tow) for a late lunch around 3pm Saturday.\n\nThe design is a little trendy and a little masculine, but overall very tasteful. I love the orange accents (hand-spun water glasses) and the stunning lighting, as one other reviewer mentioned. The patio was too warm for the 112F heat, but would have been great at another season. If I'm nit-picking (which I always do), the decor & atmosphere might be a little schmancy for the location, but it wasn't uncomfortable.\n\nThe menu is the perfect size, not too much choice, but everything looks amazingly tasty. They have recently added a separate \"lunch menu\" but we didn't want to go that direction. We really wanted to try a little of everything, so we ordered the following & ate everything family-style:\n- Mozzarella Bar (all 3 cheeses) with pesto, artichokes, & prosciutto\n- Polpette (turkey meatballs in sauce)\n- Octopus salad (can't remember the name, and it's not on the online menu)\n- Pizza Romana: Prosciutto e Rucola\n- Two hearty portions of the fresh-baked thick-crust dough with a light sprinkling of light olive oil\n- mixed-in: sparkling water, iced tea, a glass of red wine, espresso, and a couple Americanos\n\nMy husband is crazy-picky about his Italian food (even pizza); I'm a little easier-to-please. We were both completely smitten. Everything was fantastic! Some notes:\n- smoked mozzarella was too smokey for me, but I H8 smoke. The stracciatella was heavenly. The bed of arugula was my favorite accompaniment.\n- Turkey meatballs were my 2nd-fave (2nd to the pizza itself). The sauce was incredible, and the texture was unreal. Even my husband (also a meatball snob) was impressed. A definite-recommend.\n- I skipped the octopus, but the balance of the salad in which it was served was excellent.\n- I can't even begin to write words that would do this pizza justice. Hands-down, the best pizza I've ever had. Even better than Settebello's Capricciosa because of the crust. Thin, cracker-like-yet-soft, melt-in-your-mouth...the PERFECT canvas for amazing toppings. I truly cannot pick a \"favorite\" aspect of this pie...not too complex, not too simple...you get the point.\n\nBTW, I'm *shocked* to see all the \"this place is way too pricey for pizza\" reviews. Nearly every ingredient is imported from Italy, and it shows (& tastes like it). It's not like you're getting Papa John's. It's gourmet (I hate that word), artisan-style pizza, on a whole different plane than regular pizza places. Yes, it was pricier than the $7 lunch pizza at Applebee's, but not at all the same animal.\n\nGiven that, it was a bit of a pricey lunch. But, I can't argue that the value is there - without question. And, combined with the atmosphere, it would be a great \"date-night\" spot."

Comes in two styles Neapolitan and Roman, hence the name Due Forni or \"two ovens?\".  Excuse my poor italian. :)\n\nHere are the descriptions of the two crusts you can select for your delicioso pizzas:\nNeapolitan: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=U9bozWCAPoMsgD6A2KAgDA\nRoman:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=4TSahuQoDAsDA4PC8B1jNQ\n\nTo start, we had the Semolina Gnocchi which had smoked bacon, peas and black truffle sauce and it was so delicious.  Every single bite was savory and amazing.  Seriously it's addicting, you could eat that dish for dayyys.  \n\nHere's what it looks like: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=eT9UIn-4wzxAYPnGMzAtOg\n\nThen we ordered two pizzas:\n\nProsciutto e Rucola, Roman Style: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=deH14nj-XsuXJswDmSV-8w\n\nAnd, Tartufo, Neapolitan Style: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=O-tyy_7TCsHzNgwJLO99nw\n\nBoth pizzas were tasty, the prosciutto was fresh and melt in your mouth amazing.  But the highlight of the evening was definitely the Tartufo.  This is the \"Egg Mcmuffin\" of pizzas people.  \n\nThe Tartufo came out and it looked so pretty with a nice over easy egg perfectly sitting in the center.  Then it our server brings out his spoon, cracks the egg and smears it across and around.  I was thinking to myself, \"NOOOOOOOO, what are you doing to my pizza?\"  Not realizing that if he didn't smear it, every bite wouldn't have egg in it..\n\nTook a bite and BAZZZINGA! amazing!  It was like a taste bud orgasm.  It was like a party in my mouth. It was like drinking from a fountain of truffle goodness.  It is pizza heaven!\n\nMy buddy and I literally were blown away by the amazing pizzas and gnocchi.  The front of the house manager is super nice too.  He walks by every table and chats up a story definitely giving the place a home-y feeling to it.  Its very trendy with a wide selection of wines and they have a sample that you can try. I think it was 3 6 oz pours of 3 different wines for $30? i'm not exactly sure on the numbers but my friend and I were definitely here for the pizza. \n\nIt is a shame that Due Forni is way out on the west side in West Summerlin but if you get the chance to try this place definitely do.  It was a foodie experience i will never forget and when i'm back in LV again, i'll be back for more TARTUFO!"

            "review": "So my wife has recently had her Jones on for a return trip to Due Forni and I felt this past weekend was the time to make it happen. We had made our first trip to Due Forni in September of last year based on a tip we had received during a doctor appointment and fell in love with the place immediately. Unfortunately, we hadn't made it back until this last Friday evening and the experience was even better than the first time.\n\n  We were met at the door by the same guy that seated us on our first trip in and I turned to my wife and said, \"This is one of the guys we were talking the last time we were here\".  He overheard me and replied that he remembered us. At this point I was ready to throw the bullsh$t flag until he said to me, \"You were wearing a Grimaldi's Pizzeria shirt the last time you were here\". Wow!! Then he proceeded to tell us where we sat (at the bar) and recited part of our order! Are you kidding??!! Anyone that is that is that committed to knowing their customers has my business for sure. This gentleman, Alex, then took us to our table in the outdoor seating area. \n\n  Our server came over and took our appetizer order; the Mozzarella Bar with stracciatella style mozzarella and basil pesto. The creamy cheese was the perfect complement to the pesto and pizza crust that is part of this wonderful plate. This was truly a great start to an excellent meal. We also ordered the wine flights which came with a half glasses (about 4 0z.) of each Dolcetto, Barbera and Nebbiolo. The girls loved the Dolcetto and quite frankly I was a fan of all three. I will warn you that the Nebbiolo is a very full bodied, oaky wine. If you're a pinot or lighter zin drinker the Nebbiolo may put you in a head lock. You've been warned.\n\n  Dinner was what it always is for us at a place like Due Forni; Neapolitan style margherita pizza. Just like our first time at Due Forni we were very pleased with our dinners. The crust had the perfect char that you would expect from a good Neapolitan style pizza, sweet San Marzano pizza sauce and just the right amount of Bufala mozzarella and basil. As we devoured our pies another server named Adam came over to check on us. I recognized him from our first trip as well and asked him if tended bar part of the time. He said he did and he remembered us as well from our previous visit. Again, I was quite impressed that we were remembered.\n\n  We finished dinner with two of the same dessert we had before; chocolate gelato with crispy bacon crumbles and whipped bufala ricotta with toasted pistachios and honey drizzle. And once again, any description I would try to give wouldn't do them justice. The sweet creaminess of the chocolate gelato contrasted by the smoky, savory bacon works perfectly together while the fluffy whipped ricotta and toasted pistachios are a little slice of heaven.\n\n  I know this review is a little long, but I really believe that Due Forni is a must try restaurant for anyone that enjoys great food."

The gnocchi, spinach salad, steak and potatoes with truffle oil were fantastic as well. For dessert, I enjoyed the buffalo ricotta with honey (supposedly only about 350 calories) which was very yummy! My husband loved the chocolate gelato with bacon, which at first sounds like an odd combination, but it works!\n\nIn my experience, service has been good. Location is also convenient, right off Town Center and 215."

            "review": "I had been here before and was slightly impressed the first time, so I figured I would give it another go. This time, I was going for their \"Restaurant Week\" lunch menu. Our server, Brad, seemed overwhelmed with the Two - Three tables he had. My water glass was empty until 20 mins after my order had been taken. The manager had to stop by and fill it up after seeing me fiddling with it. He came by once, after my order was taken, and said, \"dont worry, I didn't forget about you guys\". \n\nFor my app, I ordered the \"Stracciatella\"(refer to pic), which had some good elements, but once 4 out of the 5 elements ran out, it was just a whole bunch of cheese and oil left over. In the appetizer, there were three tomatoes, one crustini, a few leaves of basil, two slices of sopressata, around 6 oz of bufala mozzarella, and oil. There was just WAY too much creamy, bufala mozzarella compared to everything else.\n\nFor my lunch entree, I ordered the \"Oven Roasted Short Rib Pizza\"(refer to pic), which was delicious.. at first. After a while, once again, there was just way too much oil. I liked the short rib and arugula combination. Even the crispy bread withstood the watery sauce that was coming from the short ribs. After a few pieces, it wasn't appetizing or enjoyable.\n\nFor dessert, I received their \"Chocolate Gelato\"(refer to pic) which was good. Silky, smooth, and decadent, just the way I like it. \n\nOverall, the meal was so-so, but the service was below standards, for not only people that are in the industry, but regular guests as well. I'm glad I went out and \"contributed\" to Three Square, but was very sad that I didn't leave feeling I had an amazing experience."

We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. The wine was delish.  Food was prepared perfectly and arrived in a timely fashion. Our waiter was attentive but never pesty and he had great suggestions all night.  We ate, we drank, we conqured! \n\nThe pizza is not your typical Pappa Johns or Grimaldis, and if you come into this establishment with those expectations then you will be disappointed. This is pizza made the Italian and European way. It's not laden in sauce.  You'll find arugala, sweet red peppers and fresh bufala mozarella cheese as toppings.  It is an absolute crying shame if you don't order wine while dinning, it's a crucial part of the meal. Due Forni is out of the box, gourmet even and sure to please the most sophisticated of palates\n\nAppetizer: \n\nPolipo...\"Braised Octopus and Mint Vinegarette?' I asked hesitantly as I read it off the menu.  But it was sure to be one of my favorite dishes of the night.  I did not taste Mint at all in the dish, which in my opinon saved it! The salty and crispy Spanish Octopus tossed into a lighlty dressed arugala and pepper salad was just brilliant! Please don't leave without trying it.  \n\nWe definitely made the mistake of ordering too much food.  You can easily share a pizza and have just enough room for dessert.  But instead we each ordered our own pizza, bottle of wine, appetizer and dessert! Yes, big fatties tonight.\n\nPizza:\n\nHubby ordered a Roman style, Due Forni pizza and I ordered the Tartufo pizza Neopolitan style.  The Due Forni pizza had great flavor.  Loved the homemade sausage.  I also loved the little red peppers too.  It's perfect for someone who appreciates a hefty meat lovers pizza. I can't begin to tell you how rich and decadent my Tartufo pizza was!  The rich parmesan crema on top of the fontina cheese mixed with roasted mushroms, black truffles and the baked egg that gets broken on top is beyond incredible. I know it sounds unusual but to say it's delicious is an understatement and the neopolitan crust was soft enough to sop up the yoke just like a good breadstick! \n\nWe rounded out the night with a bottle of Volare(RED) to accompany the food and dessert.  We then finished up the night with the dessert on special.  It was a pancotta with ice cream and cherries with a balsamic drizzle.  We used our groupon and waddled out the door and fell into a lovely food coma on our couch afterwards at home.  I'd say all in all it was a GRRRRRRRRRRRRRREAT night! ;)"

I don't like olives, but they really worked with the octopus well. The beet salad at other restaurants are usually arugula salads with 4 or 5 pieces of beets. This salad had a heaping amount of beets on it and was so good! The pesto and goat cheese worked very well with it. We got the Due Forni pizza which was delicious as always and also the Maiale. THAT was amazing. It had pork ragu on it and had a bit of a spice kick, which I loved. So flavorful and delicious. \n\nI knocked off one star for the service. The manager who walked us to our table was very pleasant. Our server was Sergio, and while he was decent, it seemed like we were a bit of a bother to him. It took a while to get our drinks and check, and I never received the Coke I ordered. Also, in the middle of eating our meatballs, he said, \"would you like some of our house made bread to go with that?\" We said yes. We get the check and see that we were charged for it. I'm sorry, but if you're charging for the bread that you OFFERED us, shouldn't you tell us that we're paying for it instead of us just finding it on the check? Don't get me wrong, it was good bread and I don't mind paying it, but it's the principle. Don't offer something unless you let them know it's not complimentary. It was bread, not an actual dish. \n\nOther than that, the food is delicious. Too delicious to stay away. I'll be back to try more things."

We had the beet salad with pesto, arugula, and shaved drunken goat, bacon gnocchi with truffle butter (very carbonara-esque), prosciutto pizza with fontina, balsamic glaze and caramelized onions, and the chocolate pizza- which was covered in powdered sugar, strawberries and Nutella. \n\nI can barely move right now from the indulgence but it was worth every bite. Everyone we met who was working was awesome. Very social and friendly but not over the top. \n\nI am from San Francisco and have been missing the food culture that SF is known for- every little bar and restaurant is outstanding.

Nevertheless, Due Forni is a pizza place that makes pizza two ways - one with a crispy-on-the-outside but soft-on-the-inside Neapolitan crust, or a thin crispy Roman crust. You can choose either cooking method for any of the pizza choices, and while some pizzas favor one method over another, both ovens (the \"forni\" in Due Forni) make amazing pizzas.\n\nAs for the pizzas themselves, we tried two. The first was a traditional pizza with tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella home made sausage bacon and peppers which was absolutely delicious. In particular the \"house made\" sausage was very good - outstanding really. I should also say the tomato sauce tasted like it was made from tomatoes grown in your grandma's garden - incredibly fresh and flavorful. The other pizza we had was the \"Tartufo,\" and although it's the priciest food item on the menu it was easily worth every penny. Roasted Cremini mushrooms, black truffle and a \"easy baked\" (read: practically raw) egg made it one of the most remarkable pizzas I've ever had. Truffles on anything is going to make it great, but this pizza is truly special. \n\nEqually special was the \"chocolate pizza,\" and before you dismiss it as some sort of lame Italian version of a Choco-Taco, imagine this - a chocolate hazelnut ganache (think of the best Nutella you can possibly imagine) spread between two layers of their already amazing pizza crust. Then the whole thing is baked in the oven and served hot with chopped strawberries, drizzled chocolate, chopped hazelnuts and ice cream. Like the Tartufo, I've never had anything like it.\n\nThe restaurant has only been open for about nine weeks, and even so everything seemed to be running along very smoothly. The decor is modern and very well done without being too stuffy, but don't expect to catch the game while you scarf down pizza and beers with your bros - it's not that kind of place. We brought our children in for dinner on the early-side and were made to feel welcome, though if your kids aren't great at eating out I'd probably pick another place. Some people here on Yelp have complained about the prices, but considering the quality of the food and the atmosphere I thought the prices were right where they should be. Also, everything on the wine list was available by the glass as well as bottle (something I very rarely see). Our service was great and everyone was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu and wine list. \n\nDue Forni is the kind of place that Summerlin has been missing - a great concept with great food executed almost perfectly. I highly recommend it and hope it's around for a long, long time."

The semolina gnocchi is one of my favorites in town, and you can't go wrong with the pizzas. All that being said: if it's a mushroom soup day, don't pass it up! It's perfection.\nIt has a very cool atmosphere without being cheesy. Spaghetti westerns play on the televisions and Edison bulbs dangle in just the right spots. They have a couple of amazing drinks that are made in house that can't be beat (ask for the cremecello for a shot of sunshine in a glass) and a solid wine/beer selection. We generally luck out and get one of the same three servers each time, and they give some of the best service in town.\nIt is our go-to restaurant when we can't make a decision on the hundreds of other restaurants in the area."

They pay attention to details here, even the waiter who was new and shadowing my waiter made sure to turning the label of the water bottle in my direction after pouring.  Its SO nice to be taken care of...\n\nI ordered the roasted beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios on arugula to start and the Neapolitan margherita pizza.  I am a huge fan of beets, so I was thrilled with the generous portion.  The goat cheese was nice quality, too.  The pizza was good and had a nice char from the oven.  My waiter nicely explained to me that this style of pizza is made with dough that has a higher water content, so the middle tends to be wetter.  It wasn't the best Neapolitan pizza I've ever had but it was tasty.  And is pizza ever really bad?  \n\nFood was 4 stars.  Service was 5+.  I've had much more expensive dinners in this city that weren't half as good.  The wine list looked nice.  I didn't partake but a table a few down from mine seemed to be having a great time enjoying some nice bottles of red.  \n\nI liked the outdoor patio (it was cool enough to sit outsice) but the bar was packed, too.  It looked like there were some good spots to have a beer, get dinner and watch a game."

            "review": "A very pricey pizza place.  I've said before in another review that I have a hard time paying a lot for Italian food, and this place is expensive.  We paid over $50 for a pizza that was on the smallish side, an app, and 2 drinks.  It's a pizza place; $50?!?\n\nDrinks: They have a full, but limited bar.  My husband wanted a Jack and Coke, but they don't carry Jack.  He ended up getting a Bulliet and Coke, which came in a very tiny glass.  Even though it was tiny, it was a pretty strong pour, I gotta give them that.  I had a very nice glass of wine for around $11, so not bad.\n\nFood: Beef carpaccio for an app.  It is rolled like a sushi roll and the meat is sliced thicker than other carpaccio I've had, so you could really taste the meat.  I very much enjoyed it.  After, we ordered the Due Forni pizza.  It was $16 and I was a little dismayed at the small size of it when we got it.  More dismayed when I started eating it and there was hardly any toppings; it was a lot of dough.  That's some expensive, bare pizza.\n\nService: Overbearing!  The moment we walked in, we had two people greeting us with plastered on smiles from both sides of the restaurant.  When seated, a guy who I think was the manager came over and talked forever about every menu item and the ingredients in each one.  Let me look at the menu and if I have questions, I'll ask thankyouverymuch.  But the kicker was when my husband's drink was finished...3 different people asked if he wanted a refill literally within 30 seconds.  Too many hands in the cookie jar if you ask me.  The waitress was also very pushy when we declined dessert and kept insisting we try something.\n\nI think I'd come here to sit at the bar and have some drinks, but I wouldn't spend that much money on the pizza again."

Its not your average pizza parlour with sausage peperoni pizza( though I love those too), but an upscale creative use of fresh and high quality ingredients. \nI love the thicker crust Neopolitan. It is soft and has a wonderful flavor. Some crust has a yeasty tang, this is perfect!!!!\nWe also had the gnocchis. Dont think the typical potato and flour combo, think a fatter short noodle. They toss them in a sauce with smoky bacon, peas and cheese. SSSSOOO tasty!\nWe couldnt choose what dessert to pick, so we orderd the chocolate pizza and the sweet ricotta. Amazing for both!!! The pizza is on the same thick crust with high quality choco poured over it wht strawberries and almonds and a dollop of vanilla gelato. The sweet ricotta is not too sweet though it has a thick honey poured over it and sprinkled with chopped pistachios. I cant wait to go back!!!"

I must say that I prefer the pizza at Settebello, however as far as ambiance goes, this place is hopping. One goes to Settebello to eat the best pizza in the world and then get out of there. Due Forni was designed to make diner linger, they have a decent wine menu and have this great little terrace where you can just chill. \n\nWhile their pizza smay not be the best in town, their apperizers and mozzarella bar are the bomb! Literally every item is wonderful; you'd be remiss to not try at least one item. When I go we usually order a bunch of apps and maybe one pizza. \n\nI read an article where John Curtas raves about their roasted branzino, making the most out of their super-hot oven and supreme quality offish. I have yet to try it but it sounds delish."

The prociutto was laid in long slices across the pie making it sloppy and difficult to eat. the sauce was unimpressive and the pie wasnt even sliced. Do they really expect you to eat pizza with a fork and knife??? Ok so the menu looks like they might make good food so i tried the braised rib dish with \"creamy polenta\".....there was nothing creamy or polenta about it. The meat was cooked properly but the sauce was on the sweet side the vegetables were laughable and the polenta was just abominable. A teaspoon of corn meal beaten with some water over a flame does not make POLENTA. In conclusion, this place fools its locals into thinking they are fine dining and they pay for it."

When I went there, they no longer served it. I asked if they had duck pizza and the guy just said no. \n\nWe went there without a reservation. The host asked us if we had a reservation, and then seated us because there was availability. As we were walking to our table, the host walked over to us and asked for name for the table. I just thought that was odd. Maybe their system is weird or something. \n\nThe waiter described a few things to us. We ended up ordering the daily lasagna special which was a short rib lasagna and due forni pizza. The lasagna came out and looked pretty small for the price. The sweet short rib and lasagna fusion did not work out! It wasn't that great. The short rib was good, but it's just not meant to mix with lasagna. The pizza was decent- nothing special about it. In fact, I feel that the crust was a bit burnt in some parts.  \n\nThe service was really superb here. The waiter came around a few times to ask us if we liked our food. He refilled our waters a few times.  I actually hate when people refill my water all the time because i feel like it's a waste if I don't drink all the water. So, I told him I didn't want it refilled. Another waitress who wasn't attending us noticed that my water wasn't filled, and she went to refill my water which is nice. The other waiter did tell her that I did not want my water refilled. \n\nService is top- notch. I just didn't enjoy the food that much. It was pretty pricey."

The price point was too high for our taste.\n\nThe place has a cool vibe.  We sat outside, under the heat lamps, and had a laugh over the bright orange plastic chairs, which reminded all of us of the chairs in elementary school.  The dark wood, which so many people find \"modern\" is straight out of the late 60s, early 70s, especially with the \"burnt orange\" chairs.  My aunt's fridge was the same exact color.\n\nThe service was awesome, as one would expect it to be in a new restaurant.  Everyone was VERY knowledgeable and helpful, which we greatly appreciated.\n\nWe split the panzanella salad, which was fine, but certainly not spectacular. We did all appreciate the freshness of the ingredients.  \n\nWe then split a classica mozarella bar with the artichoke hearts.  The mozarella was good, the artichoke hearts were completely underwhelming.  The quantity of them was sad, sad, sad, and they were very lightly seasoned (to put it mildly, we found it bland.)\n\nLast, our pizza.  We had the Prosciutto e Rucola on the Neopolitan crust, as was recommended by our server.  The crust was the perfect blend of crunchy and chewy, the prosciutto was plentiful, and the flavor was, well, pretty bland.  There was so little smoked mozarella that I don't think I even had a bite of it on my slice.  \n\nWe contemplated desserts, but with only 3 choices, and none of them all that appealing to us, we decided against it.  \n\nWe were kinda bummed by the lack-luster performance, as we frequently walk to Rachel's for breakfast and lunch, and Hokkaido for dinner, and we were excited to have a cool place to hang out and eat some tasty food.  But the reality is, for the price and the mediocre food, I don't see us going there again any time soon.  \n\nI much prefer going to Nora's on Flamingo and Jones for salad, pizza and wine.  Their food is superior, and I don't leave there hungry."

The quick-fired pizza dough, with a soft baked egg dropped and spread over the toppings after the pizza left the oven, was chewy and smooth, the prosciutto tasty, and the mushrooms fine.  A Neapolitan-style Due Forni Pizza was also enjoyable, with mild sausage and Nueske's Bacon the prominent toppings.\n\nI liked the Chocolate Gelato but could have gone without the bacon added to make my dessert a Nueske's Bacon Chocolate Gelato.

Jazzy music playing throughout, maybe a bit too loudly, but it helps drown out the chatty diners & drinkers.  There is a PATIO!!!!  Yay!!!   Just a bit too hot today.  Unless there's a kids menu you can ask for, I can't imagine many KIDS would enjoy this place...pizza maybe, but they looked pretty fancy-pants.   Maybe call ahead & ask if that's your situation.  \n\ndrinks - tons of WINE choices, few were recognizable to me, so I need to study up.    Prices range from $6-$17/glass.  I had a $6.95 red blend (that hubs abandoned) and it was perfectly fine.   The prosecco is sweet....& really the only sweet wine on the menu.    Ditto on the BEERS (not the sweetness part).  Only corona light was a familiar sip.   An unusually high assortment of APERITIFS & 2 tawny ports (a 10 & a 20 year old).   They were out of the 10 yr port so I tried the amaro modernegro (I think I got it right).  It was citrusy smooth with a flippy finish that didn't linger too long.  I'd order again.  \n\nFOOD---panzanella SALAD doesn't look like much, but it's awesome!    Just enough dressing to flavor the tender arugula & not drench the crazy crispy bread.  \n\nThe Caesar salad was \"good\" per hubs.  When I asked him if he'd order again, \"maybe\" was all I could get.  I didn't taste it so take it for what you will.   \n\nThe GNOCCHI is to-die-for!  We both agreed on that!   Gnocchi is a nice consistency.... not pillowy dough like you sometimes get.   More along the lines of pasta consistency & skinny.   So if you're looking for the doughy, yeasty, clumpettes you usually get, adjust your expectations & you'll enjoy. \n\nThe LASAGNA is fancy-pants.  Tonight's selection was braised buffalo.   Another \"good\" from the food \"critic\".  Really he prefers home style, chunky, cheesy, slathered in sauce layered between over-cooked noodles so what showed up in its cute little cast iron dish really wasn't what he was expecting so it was an uphill battle from there.   I can tell you though.....he cleaned his plate!\n\nDesserts weren't all that enticing to me.    We split the bread pudding.   Got an \"ok\" from the food \"critic\".   I'm not a bread pudding fan, so 2 bites was more than plenty for me and I'm probably not a qualified bread pusding judge.  \n\nIf you like bread with your meal, it can be ordered....but it's not on the menu.  \n\nService -- Sergio was a gracious server....even when the \"critic\" ordered a $6 glass of wine after asking for a recommendation.  And then shockingly didn't care for it & drank my prosecco.  \n\nOverall, a little more \"work\" in deciding what to eat & drink.  But we'll definitely be back.   Only 4 stars because the \"critic\" didn't enjoy it as much as me, bread wasn't offered, desert was average & the loud-ish music.   Maybe we can up it to 5 next time."

We went with the Tartufo pizza napoletana style because it had egg spread over it.  And also because I'm crazy for black truffles.   It was delicious!"

The seating is casual. \nThey have a good wine selection, but the food selection is a tad smaller. \n\nSo we tried: \n\nThe Lasagna on special. It was an odd one. It was braised short rib with squash and zucchini. It didn't sound good at all, but the waiter insisted. Honestly, it was really good. We were both pleasantly surprised. \nI had the Tartufo pizza. Because - truffle. I love truffle. The smell, the taste. It hits my spot. Whatever that means. :)\nIt was delicious. And I was even hesitant about the egg, but if you are--DO NOT BE! It was quite the topper for this delectable dish. \n\nThe waiter was super friendly and very knowledgeable. Maybe a little too knowledgable. In the way that he went into crazy detail about the food. But, he was super passionate about his job. Which is a great thing. \n\nOverall, I would love to try it again and have other dishes. It's just a little further for us. But when you have good food and booze, it's worth going a little out of your way."

Went in today at 5:30PM and dined on the patio- it was a gorgeous and breezy day, perfect for alfresco wine and pizza with my guy before he went off for the night shift.\n\nHad difficulty selecting a wine, server suggested a flight with three of their reserved wines in smaller pours. Sounded good, so we went for it and really enjoyed the presentation with the printed descriptions of each glass as a placemat. \nFirst wine was light and to my liking, second was my guy's favorite- fuller bodied and reminiscent of a cab, but the third was overwhelmingly acidic and we did not drink it.\n\nOrdered the Miala Bolognese pizza, romana style, at our server's suggestion (pork ragu, san marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, basil, caramelized onion, clabrian pepper)- very hearty with just a bit of spice, amazing cheese. Roman style crust was thin, crispy, and crackly, but still firm. The combination of tomatoes and cheese and crust was spectacular- made me very curious to try the margherita.\nUnfortunately the pork was on the dry side, but it was still surprisingly flavorful and did not detract from the other elements of the dish- kind of an impressive feat. Pork itself was also notably not fatty, getting it's flavor from quality.\n\nThen we got the bill- just under $20 for an artisan-style pizza with high quality toppings, not bad. But the wine flight, not listed on the menu or mentioned in price by the server who suggested it, was a surprisingly high $36, for 9 oz- only 6 of which we even drank. Had I known the flight was equivalent to three entire glasses of wine, I would have chosen from the menu and had one large glass of a wine I DID like rather than merely sips, and leaving an entire glass behind unfinished.\n\nIt wasn't until I pulled up the business page on Yelp that I noticed we were there smack-dab in the middle of happy hour- from 4:30 to 6:30, FYI, and yet no one we interacted with, from the bartender, to the host, to the server, ever bothered to mention it or drop off a menu of their featured specials.\nNot sure what is to blame for this oversight- would have much rather had the goat cheese appetizer and a single glass of wine with my pizza, had I known about the HH specials or the actual price of my wine flight. This should be mentioned when suggesting it to other diners in the future.\n\nTL;DR: Pizza is sublime and delicious, star subtracted for lack of transparency with pricing of wine flight suggested by server."

Service is excellent but not too formal, pizza is traditional and simplistic, the appetizers and dessert you should make a separate trip for. \n\nThe wine selection is limited to a few dozen nice varietals, one section in the $50ish per bottle range, and the other in the $100ish. Again very simple and saves you from having to browse through pages and pages of hundreds of different prices and types.\n\nThey appear to have two large, real pizza ovens which you can see through the glass partition. We had a simple Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto which was fantastic, a bowl of decadent Gnocchi  and the Chef's platter. Nothing fancy; simple, perfect, delicious.\n\nWe plan on stopping by happy hour and just trying the mozzarella bar. Will report back with more\n\nIf you want a slice of Italy to compliment your busy week, these are the people and this is the place."

            "review": "This review is based on my experience dining at Due Forni's during Restaurant Week 2013. \n\nIt was Pi(e) Day when I visited, so maybe a Short Rib pizza pie was what I should've ordered as my main course off the Restaurant Week menu, but I was really feeling like chicken that night. \n\nLet me get down to that restaurant menu. Du Forni's was the first restaurant that I've visited during a Restaurant Week that didn't include items from their regular menu on their Restaurant Week menu. I found this to be rather odd, but thought it was good of them to switch it up and offer new items just for the week. \n\nFOOD\n\nThree Course Meal (Dinner): About $30.00\n\nAntipasti: I had the Insalata which was mixed greens, artichokes, olives (mehhh), and a drizzle of white balsamic vinaigrette. I agree with what my friend noted in her review that this salad was underwhelming. I could've made this at home. \n\nSecondi: I chose the Oven Roasted Chicken because its description made it sound like it had much more substance than just a straight up pizza. The chicken was accompanied by bacon, potatoes, spring onions, and Calabrian peppers. I was quite surprise that there was a kick of spice to the chicken. Again, this was also underwhelming and something I could've cooked up better. The vegetables were my favorite part of my entree and were much more flavorful.\n\nDolci: Dessert was my favorite part of the dinner. The Bourbon Caramel Panna Cotta was vanilla gelato topped with walnuts and swimming in a sweet-salty sauce. The downside of this dessert was that it was melting at a fast rate. \n\nSERVICE\nSlow and on the awkward side - they gave us mini spoons for our chicken. \n\nOTHER\nOne of the best parts of my experience at Due Forni's was dining out on their patio. Of course, if the weather isn't chilly, crazy hot, or windy, go for it. \n\nOVERALL\nThe food didn't wow me; therefore, Due Forni's is just A-OK."

It's pretty casual and comfortable. The music... Well that needs some help... Really weird melodies playing on a Monday night:/ \n\nWe were greeted at the door by a very friendly and well dressed older man. I'm assuming he is the manager. He held the door and sat us promptly. We opted for patio seating and I was so glad we did! The patio is covered with fans to help keep it cool. The seating was comfortable and the tables were sturdy. \n\nOur server was nice. He told us about the menu and went over the beers and wines. I ordered a red blend, nothing fancy... Still tasty though. My boyfriend and I opted to split the beet salad (made vegan) and the veggie gluten free pizza (also prepared vegan). I'm not one to complain... But... $4.95 extra to prepare a small 8inch pizza gluten free is just a tad bit pushing my limits. Our pizza was around 23.00 dollars after tax. It was pretty delicious though. I would order it again... When I want to splurge on pizza. The veggies were fresh And the dough was not overly spongey or crisp. We did mention sharing the beet salad... And they split it for is on two plates (nice gesture) ;) It was really good. One of my favorite beet salads thus far... The pistachios added a great crunch. Our friend ordered a chicken Caesar salad. It was a pretty standard portion... Not very difficult to mess up... He said it was good. \n\nThe server gave us our bill without an itemized (something I really despise). I like to look over everything on the tab. I can not tell you how many times I've been over charged, under charged, didn't receive add Ins I was charged for, and auto grated on tabs I would of really just never questioned without the itemized. If I could knock half of a star for this... I would. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely be back."

I went with friends as we had heard great things & wanted to try the chocolate pizza.

When I said something, she explained that \"it\" was small so she thought we would want them together. I don't know what that means either.  Then as we tried to enjoy the chocolate pizza we had come for, she whisked away our plates & silverware even though we were clearly still eating.  The food is not worth the bums rush.

When we asked about it, and let the bartender know the web site information we saw, her reply was \"yeah, they JUST changed the prices yesterday and they haven't updated our web site yet.\" I pressed it slightly to see what they would do and she just said \"yeah, there not really anything I can do.\"  Didn't offer to talk to the manager or even a real apology about the mix up. A gentleman walked up to the bar and he appeared to either be a manager or shift supervisor to some degree. I mentioned it to him and he said the same thing about the recent change. I was fine paying it, but it was amazing to me that there was not even the slightest attempt to make it right. I'm not sure if web sites are considered \"advertising\" but, if they are, this was certainly misleading. The website should have been updated before the price change, not after. \n\nThe food was not bad but not great. We ordered calamari and a pizza. The calamari was good, but the bread that came with it was burnt on the edge. I broke the burnt part off and write it off as not a huge deal. When they brought the pizza out there were three sections around the crust that were really burnt. The bottom had several burnt patches as well. \n\nOverall, not impressed at all. The second star was for the calamari being very good."

I need to put Due Forni in the same sentence as \"Napoletana Pizza\" so if others searching for a great neopolitan pizza in the Summerlin area, as I have been for the past few years, do an Internet search, Due Forni shows up.\n\nFor years, Papa Lou and I have been trekking to Settebello for our fave pizza, but I think Due Forni will satisfy my love for Napoletana pizza just fine. The crust was perfectly charred, soft and chewy. My husband ordered the Due Forni pizza on the Roman crust, and although the toppings were plentiful, they were not overwhelming at all; in fact, the sausage was delicious. The crust was light and crisp, but I much prefer the pizza I ordered with the Napoletana crust. I prefer not to muck my pizza up with toppings and go for the Margherita....and the fresh ingredients did not disappoint. \n\nWe completely indulged and ordered the tiramisu gelato and sweet bufala ricotta with pistachios and honey -- OMG - it was un-freakin-believable! The ricotta was so creamy and delectable I would return just for that and that alone!\n\nUndoubtedly Due Forni is a place I will return to soon!"

It's next to Hokkaido and Rachel's Kitchen. \n\nNext, the restaurant is very cool looking with a covered outdoor patio. I'm sure they are waiting for the weather to get warmer but they have heat lamps out there so they can use it now... hint hint =) \nThe interior is sleek and urban with orange and brown accents that match their logo/theme. The restaurant is split into two sides, the dining area and and the bar area. I like this because there is a separation between both which has a different vibe for each. Dining area is much more family feel while bar is casual cool wine lounge with yummy food. OF course the centerpiece are the two pizza ovens in the kitchen area. And if you are wondering, that's the kitchen... that's it, all open. Isn't that crazy?\nAnd you can if you want, stand up at the glass partition to watch them make your pizza. I watched them for a bit and that's when Chef Carlos said hi and told me about the open kitchen. \n\nI just got off work and was hungry so I went straight for the good stuff.. the pizza. There are two kinds of pizza: Neapolitan or Roman. I was like, what is Roman style. Apparently, it's like a cracker crust. I will try next time. I ordered the Picante (cuz I like it spicy), and added garlic and an over-easy egg. I love pizza places that add egg to the top of the pizza! Well needless to say, the pizza was amazing and spicy. The Sopressata, red peppers, garlic, San Marzano tomato and egg all worked together. The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and probably a couple more. I usually dip my remaining crust in olive oil and I ended up pouring the olive oil all over the pizza - some good olive oil. \n\nNext time I will need to try the app, esp the Carpaccio, Gnocchi, Scampi the Mozzarella Bar, and of course more pizza.

After visiting this establishment 2 times (my hubby 3 times), there appeared to be significant difference between the two visits.\n\nThe dark decor has its charms. Large plasma screens replay The Good, The Bad and The Ugly on a continuous loop. The spartan decorative lightbulbs hang from the ceiling while two large pizza ovens dominate the open kitchen area. FYI - the wooden chairs are not kind to the tush. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, we came for dinner with a friend and indulged in a great meal. We had their spinach salad, semolina gnocchi, Pizza Bianca and Duo Forni pizza. Several weeks later, we came into try their seasonal specials of foie gras pizza and sausage rapini combination which were not nearly the same quality as the first visit.\n\nOf note, the hubby preferred the Roman crust which is cooked at a higher temperature but for a shorter period of time. I have to admit, I'm conflicted about describing the crust. The first time, it was great - light, crispy yet with a little bit of chewiness to provide some substance (in a good way). Second visit, the crust was significantly denser and not nearly as delightful.\n\nSame experience with the spinach salad. First experience - wonderful sweet, savory flavours melding together. The addition of chickpeas, orange segments and nuts made it a complete dish. It was well dressed and seasoned. Second time round - although there was more spinach and condiments compared to the first time, the salad lacked flavour while the orange tasted a little odd.\n\nThe semolina gnocchi here is more pasta-like than your typical potato dumpling gnocchi. However, the accompanying sauce was rich and umami-ish. The smokiness of bacon paired with the sweetness of peas was a great combination. The bit of truffle was the icing on the cake.\n\nPizza Bianca had a great flavour profile - acidity of balsamic, sweet caramelized onion, salty prosciutto. Again, that first visit, the crust was superb. The Duo Forni pizza was just okay for me - I found their sausage to be a little too mild for my tastes and I wished there was a little more basil.\n\nFlash forward a few weeks and a more disappointing experience.\n\nHudson foie gras mousse, peaches, caramelized onion was not such a great combination. There wasn't enough foie gras in the mousse to taste the goose liver while its beautiful luxurious texture became grainy/soupy on the pizza. It may have been preferable to serve the foie seared and on the side/on top. The addition of all the moist ingredients made for a more soggy crust.\n\nThe rapini/sausage/pine nut pizza fared a little bit better with the crust however was lacking in flavour. Although we did substitute the blue cheese for fontina, the dish definitely needed some salt. The sausage was too mild for our tastes while the pine nuts left a burnt, bitter taste due to the high heat in the oven.\n\nIn addition, we had a couple of small quibbles about the service. 1) Our table on the second visit was dusty and had crumbs on it (we could see the outlines of where the placemats were removed), 2) an empty plate was given to us with a hair on it (although it was quickly replaced when pointed out), 3) we had to put our leftovers in a box ourselves (you would expect an upscale casual place to at least box up your leftovers... I hate to mention competitors but Grimaldi's (similarly priced pizza joint) does it.). As I said, really minor stuff because overall the staff is great and they try hard to please.\n\nOverall, considering both visits, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars review. For the price, the food is probably a little expensive given the quantity. One would expect a $16 pizza or a $10 salad to be a wee bit bigger and to have more toppings. Regardless, it's a great addition to Summerlin area."

First off, she asked what were having to drink.  When I asked for water, she glared when I refused her suggestion for imported water which came at a higher price. She brought our main course before we'd completed our appetizer of creamy mozarella with freshly baked napolotana bread and roasted artichoke. Might I add,  it was the most unique and delicious italian appetizer I've had to date. As the quattro fromaggo pizza arrived, I was lured in by the bubbling dough perfectly toasty with a meld of cheeses atop. I hesitantly put my appetizer aside for a moment to dive into this delightful pizza. Heavenly. I had put my issues aside until the server committed a third offense at the very end. After charging our meal, she returned the receipts to the table for signatures. Apparently we didn't sign fast enough as she stopped by several times to see if we'd signed. When we finally signed, she rushed over to take the receipt. As I write this and recall the experience,  waitress P tainted what should have been a remarkable dining experience."

The husband proclaimed it the best in the world, which may be an overstatement, but we got the play by play on its preparation. First, they only use Spanish octopi because the fishermen in that fine country immediately coat their catch in salt creating a more tender product for everyone to nibble. Then, it arrives at Due Forni where they marinate (I am afraid that might not be the correct word exactly, but...) it for a substantial amount of time, and then prepare it with love. It cuts like butter, and the table agreed it tastes like seafoodie heaven. Eat it!"

Their pizza ovens were imported from Italy. Toss an egg on your pizza, you wont regret it! The staff are friendly and the service is awesome! My advice, wander away from the Strip and eat like a local. Not only will you find some amazing food, you will save big bucks!"

We have kids and have limited time for our dates and almost always default to Due. You can get in and out if you need to, but the atmosphere is fantastic for marinating a Friday night.\n\nPROS: \n1. The pizza is true italian style pizza, thin chewy crust cooked in a 700* oven. I can't say enough.\n2. Very clean inside, including bathrooms. This is huge plus for us with anywhere we go to eat\n3. The beer menu - If you know your beers you are gonna salivate. Mikkellar, Evil Twin, Urban Family and Jolly Pumpkin are staples and always rotating, not to mention unique limited one offs that make guest appearances. The beer menu is half the reason we go.\n4. The Patio - In my opinion its the best in Summerlin. Its airy and open and amazing on a day with good weather, and YES they do have heaters for night.\n\nCONS:\n1. My only con is the wine prices. I'm not a big wine drinker but when we bring friends they always gripe about the prices of the wine and I tend to agree. I've never asked about a corking fee but if you're a wino it might be worth calling and asking about ahead of time. \n\nRECS:\n1. The octopus is cooked the way it should be - TRY IT, even if you dont like octopus they do it amazingly well\n2. Prosciutto Pizza - Its amazing, just do it.\n3. Beet Salad. I have hated beets ever since my mom forced me to eat them as a kid. However, due to this salad I have rekindled a broken relationship with an overlooked root vegetable.\n4. Affotago for dessert - If you like coffee you are gonna thank me for this one.\n4. Did I mention the beer?\n\nThis place is also locally owned which I am huge fan of. Give it a shot, you wont be dissapointed!"

Seriously...ridiculously delicious.  I probably could have eaten two or three more of those damn pizzas.  \n\nEven though the pizza is 20 bucks, I'll probably still go back and have it, at least for special occasions.  \n\nHighly recommended."

Our server, Brian D., was pleasant, professional and knowledgeable on all of the wines. When we didn't see our typical wines on the list, Brian made fantastic recommendations that didn't break the bank. He presented all of the specials and various menu options (our mouths were watering by the end) - but didn't try to sell/push anything on our group. \n\nWe can't wait to try more menu selections. We tried a couple of the pizzas - the toppings and combinations were unique and tasty! The pizzas definitely rival Delfina, our SF fave. Complimenti alla cuoca!\n\nThis is a great pick for a date or night out with good friends and family. We will look forward to out next visit to Vegas."

It's lovely and serene. Rocco, our server, was great -- he came by just often enough not for it to be too much.

I ordered the semolina gnocchi as my main meal, although I think it's actually an appetizer.  It wasn't as creamy as other gnocchi I've had, but that was actually okay; it was subtle and rich at the same time.  The bacon wasn't overpowering, smoked just right, and really complemented the truffle sauce.  \n\nMy friend and I each ordered the wine flights.  I had the Sangiovese flight, which included three glasses of wine (not full glasses mind you) of Sangiovese varietals.  The neat part was that the glasses were placed on a horizontal paper corresponding to the name of and information for the wine.  It was fun to try different wines without making the commitment to one particular glass.\n\nMy group actually ordered the mozzarella ball, the Quttro Formaggi pizza, the Prosciutto e Rucola pizza, and Speck pizza.  I unfortunately could not eat the pizzas or mozzarella ball, but they looked and SMELLED soooooo good.  The general consensus seemed to be that the Quttro Formaggi was the best pizza (or at least according to my husband).  \n\nTo top it off, we had the dessert pizza and chocolate lava cake.  I'm not a fan of chocolate lava, but the dessert pizza was pretty good.  It wasn't too thick, sweet, or overwhelming...you know, the kind where you have to have several gulps of water or other drink to wash it down.\n\nOverall, a great place to eat and drink!"

($12.95)\n\nbianca al prosciutto cotto: ham, fontina cheese, caramelized onions, oregano and aged balsamic. the aged balsamic coats the onions well and creates a delicious flavor pairing. the cheese is a bit strong (so beware people who do not like blue cheese and other strong cheeses). ($14.95)\n\ntartufo: black truffle, parmesan crema, fontina fontal, roasted cremini, over easy baked egg. they bring out the pizza with the over easy egg intact, break the egg table side and then spread out the egg over the pizza. the pizza does not have a strong truffle or egg taste. it tastes like a pizza very well covered with good tasting cheese. ($20.95)\n\npiccante: tomato, mozzarella, sopressata and fresno peppers. the sopressata is an italian salami that when shaved finely and cooked on a pizza tastes a lot like a very fancy pepperoni. combined with the fresno peppers, it is my favorite pizza. ($15.95)\n\nchocolate pizza: save room for the chocolate pizza. chocolate sauce drizzled over the neapolitan crust, topped with strawberries, hazelnuts and vanilla gelato. it sounds overly sweet, but the chocolate is quite delicate."
