The cheesy lounge singer is hilarious... walking around acting like a drunk Dean Martin. The food is out of this world good!! And their sangria is bomb!! I love love love this restaurant."

I have had it at plenty other places but Capo's was definitely the best.  The house salad that came with the dinner wasn't to bad also.  My Girlfriend had  Stuffed Chicken Anastatia she thought it was very good, I tried it \"excellent\".  They also had a singer for entertainment who covered old crooner hits.  I will definitely be back, sooner then later."

            "review": "I saw this restaurant on a reality tv show and was dying to try it while in Vegas. We made a reservation and grabbed a taxi from the strip (approximately $28 cab fare plus tip).  We had read about the entrance to the restaurant on yelp so knew what to expect. No disappointment there!  Once inside the VERY dark restaurant the host pointed to a booth and said \"sit over there\".  We found him quite humorous. \n\nThe food was great and the restaurant provides mini flashlights inside the menu so you can read it in the dark. Took us a while to realize this so we were using our phones at first. We had lasagna and cheese ravioli. My husband thought it was possibly the best lasagna he had eaten... And we eat out a lot.  The portions are large and served with soup or salad and bread. They have a man singing Frank tunes who comes to your table and sings and a magician who also comes to your table and does magic tricks (he didn't make it to our table. We enjoyed the musician very much. \n\nWhen we were ready to leave the mob-like host/manager/owner (not exactly sure who he was) said his driver would take us back for a flat fee of $25. The driver was a very nice Russian (I think) man who my husband enjoyed talking to (I couldn't understand a word he said). Total cost for the dinner for my husband and I (including 1 glass of wine and desert), taxi fare, and generous tip was $150. Defiantly worth it!"

I would gladly go here again if I'm in Vegas again. If you're looking for an excellent dining experience, get off the strip and this place in in Vegas the down, not the tourist parts. Go and have fun. Enjoy the experience and for god sake dress up!"

My husband had the bacon wrapped filet and said it was so good, he did not want the flavor to leave his mouth!  Coming from 2 serious Sicilians.... Capo's is the BEST and my new favorite Italian spot.  However, I did try a bite of the ravioli and I was not impressed but everything else was nothing less than amazing."

            "review": "I was treated here by my boyfriend on Valentines' day :)\n\nEntering the place is very amusing! They definitely take reservations, so call ahead! It would be much better that way! I've heard that this place is actually a speakeasy restaurant, which is very interesting! Since we had a reserved table it was funny to know we had an intimidating body guard by our table the whole night. Oh, the place is really dark. It took awhile for my eyes to adjust.\n\nSince it was valentines' day there was a menu special. Came with appetizer, entree and dessert and a coffee drink (espresso I think?)\n\nI'm not sure if it's a common thing, but our orders took a long time. I'm wondering if it's used to promote digestion between meals. But we weren't left sitting there starving, so we had alot of time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and each other's company.\n\nThere was music playing (godfather's theme 3 times in a row x.x) and a live singer was there for awhile, it was great.\n\nOverall, I think the food was okay, the bill was big ($60-$70 for just two people)\nHowever I think anyone who can afford to splurge should visit. It's a good experience."

Go now. Don't wait.\n\nAlight - so when you walk in, you're met with a closed room and a note to ring the buzzer. You do so and are surprised by someone opening a small door and getting kind of rough with you (words). I won't reveal more secrets but that should set the tone well enough. \n\nYou walk in and they have a crooner serenading the crowd and he's good. He sounds like a classic. The whole ambiance gives off this vibe of an Italian mob speakeasy. The staff is in on it, but it's never over the top or too gimmicky. \n\nWe sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, but that was the best spot. You get to watch the super focused cooks and chef run though orders with extreme focus and precision. A great spot for someone to gain insight into the dance and acrobatics that comes with the art of preparing food.\n\nThen the meal came. The pasta fagioli was superb. Freshly prepared and just as light and balanced as it is supposed to be.  I ordered Uncle Pauly's arrabbiata (sans protein) and it was AMAZING! The heat, the garlic, and that authentic sauce was a wonderful balance. The penne was cooked a perfect al dante. Seriously, so many places get it too soft, but these pros know how to do it. \n\nIf you hit up Vegas, make this a must-do. Totally worth the price."

            "review": "Place is a good idea with a mob theme however the service was pretty bad. We had a reservation at 9pm for a party of 6, and got there at 8:45 and they sat us quickly. After we got seated and we had showed our server that we had a groupon for $100 after that she only came by our table twice, the busser came by at least 10 times. Majority of the time we saw our sever doing nothing but sitting at the bar talking to another person, while our busser was busy with other tables. It took almost 15 minutes for us to pay because no one came to pick up the bill. I was so unsatisfied with their service I had asked another server to speak to their manager in charge, consequently their manager in charge was our server, which I call bull on because the other server was probably just watching out for our server's back. Definitely not going to come back here. I only gave them 2 stars because their busser was doing their job correctly."

The soup was hearty and made to perfection.\n Rigatoni with a meatball and lasagna were incomparable and surprisingly delicious.\n\nService was just right. Music and entertainment good.

Sadly it was just ok, I guess the door guy wasn't in the mood to bad I was looking forward to that.  \n\nI understand the darkness is part of the feel and fun of this place but I couldn't even read my menu the little light attached to my menu was broken.  :(  Made it extremely hard to order.  I got the lasagna when it came it was burnt so bad around the edges I couldn't cut it so I had to return it and wait for a new one.  By the time it arrived I was starving, the taste was good no complaints.\n\nOur group had a group on, when we went to pay we felt like we received attitude.  Don't sell them if you don't want people to use them.  Our waitress claimed the system was down and we couldn't use it, we refused to not use it and suddenly it was working again.  The whole time the manager who could have smoothed some feathers was sitting at the bar drinking.\n\nSo the food was ok service sucked, oh well..."

I can choose ANYWHERE! However, you know how it is. For us locals, I know every single place there is. I was feeling like Italian and didn't want to hit the strip. I've been to Maggiano's and Amore's a billion times already. So I picked Capo's to get a bit of \"atmosphere\".\n\nFirst, it seems that the Sahara location is a little smaller and MAYBE not as dark. Its also a little more open. Second, the place was basically empty at 9pm on a Friday night... kinda sad really. \n\nAll that said, my wife had the 'ala vodka' and I had the lasagna (cuz I'm crazy like that!). The food was very good; better than I remember. The service was excellent (it better be for it being so empty). The downside and a BIG reason why this isn't 5-stars... THE PRICES! Is a standard spaghetti or angel hair pasta w/ marinara sauce really worth $20? My lasagna was good, but not $18 good. \n\nAll in all, good service, good food, good atmosphere, not so good prices.\n\n(P.S. if you like a similar 'old vegas italian' atmosphere that isn't so forced, check out \"Casa di Amore\" on the east side)"

            "review": "After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.  \n\nWe showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.\n  \nAfter we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  \"Whatever\" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.\n  \nWhen we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.\n\nAfter we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.  \n\nI was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.  \n\nWhen the waitress returned the first thing she said was \"sorry we are all out of shrimp,\" this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.  \n\nI think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.  \n\nSo we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.\n\nWhen I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.\n  \nAfter we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.\n\nOverall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening."

For an off-the-strip restaurant I thought they were a bit pricey on certain items and they even charged more for an item then it was listed on the menu. The staff was overall friendly and they even had a guy singing a few songs throughout the night. There were four of us and everyone really enjoyed their meals.\n\"The Gallows With Clams\" - had been craving fresh pasta with some red clam sauce for a long time and this absolutely satisfied that craving. A bit pricey at $23 but it was a nice size portion with a good amount of clams. (similar dish at Maggianos which is on the strip is only $16)\n\"Mad Dog Marsala\" w/Chicken + mushroom risotto - Kacey ordered and enjoyed but way, way, way overpriced at $28. The meal is listed at $24 and the waitress listed off the sides available. However she failed to mention that the risotto was going to add another $4 as a substitute. Way overpriced for one piece of chicken and a little side of risotto.\n\"The Mob's Meatball Salad\" - friend that ordered it loved it. I tried Meatball and it was delicious.\n\"Capo's Lasagna\" - friend loved it.\n\nBe careful if you order drinks as they are pricey and add up quick."

Why invite a lady on your first trip together and not make definite plans on where to eat!!!??? Especially a foodie like myself. BUT man was I happy we came here!!!!!! We took a cab (one of the nicest cabbies ever,) He dropped us off in this 1980s looking center and I was like Hmmmmmm OKKKKKKKKK. But that all changed. Rang the bell and we look forward and all of a sudden to the right of us the host with heavy mob accent asked us if we made rsvps and yes we did. Who knows if we didn't. \n\n   We were seated in a nice big booth. The service was great. Our waitress was so nice and a former resident of Irvine so that was lovely. We started with some martinis and they were made so good and refreshing. We started with Tony's \"Duck\" soup and an order of meatballs. I don't know what's in the Duck soup but it was so good. The meatballs are what they're known for and OMG one of the best meatballs I've ever had. So moist and very flavorful. I remember watching their segment on Man vs. Food and I recall drooling over that scene and now I had the chance to be like Adam and indulge. This should be ordered EVERY TIME!!!!  For our entrees I ordered the veal parm and my side was mushroom risotto. He ordered the Lasagna. The portions are HUGE. I told him I was happy to share an entree because I didn't know if our hotel fridge was big enough. Some how it fit :p I guess my date was in no mood to share. I'm usually not a veal parm person but this chicken parm was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it and If I took one more bite, I'd get sick. The risotto was good but it was all about the parm. I've been thinking about it every time I crave Italian food. I tried his Lasagna and it was very good. Even he couldn't eat it all. Very satisfying meal.\n\n   \n    Overall I had a great time here and the gentleman that sung Frank sinatra was awesome, I thought they were just playing music til I looked back and it was live. He was spot on. The food was so good, I wanted to come back just to take leftovers back to Cali LOL. I can't wait to come back!!!!!"

Especially the salad with the creamy garlic. It had that very intrusive raw garlic taste even though the waitress said it wasn't going to be like that cause they use garlic seasoning instead.

(Bartenders are pretty ladies in black tiny corsets. Very nice and complimented me!)\n\nStarted with house loaf of fresh baked sourdough/Italian/French type of bread. Firm on outside and airy on inside (my fav kind) the butter that came with it was flavored with garlic, chive and possibly sage.\n\nWe ordered everything at once, we knew what we wanted :)\n\nWe started with Bruschetta and yummmmmm it was a treat! Fresh and chilled it seemed like a fresh Italian salsa almost! It was the perfect blend of garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil, EVOO, balsamic and a tiny bit of parm maybe. The bread was the same only toasted and looked brushed prior to toast with butter?\nHubby had a Caeser salad which was perfect (not too much anchovies) and fresh with just the right amount of dressing!\nOur friend he had a house with Blue Cheese and it was gone before I could try (my fav thing is BC) and he said it was perfect :)\nWhen I ordered a really always do salad but the soup was calling my name, thank goodness I asked her what it was and if she likes it, she said \"it's very popular and very good\" sold! The soup is a creamy tomato base soup with white bean and small pene like noodles, if I had a grilled cheese......it would be heaven on earth. Not too many beans, not too many noodles a dash of fine grated cheese on top. Perfect. \n\nBetween courses it's very relaxed and the dim lighting is sooooo nice. We sat in a booth straight across from the entrance area (the place is large) and hubby sat in the middle inside the booth. \nHe mentioned \"a real boss knows to always have your back, as in you sit against the wall :)\" as he said that I noticed all the mirrors above the booth :) \nYou just feel Goodfellas. Even the door guy is a \"tough guy\" and comes out of the back \"slapping shut\" the check holders about once every half hour :)\n\nAfter ordering another glass of wine and enjoying each others company here come our entrees :)\n\nOur friend had chicken parm with the side of pasta spaghetti and gravy it usually comes with. He said it was wonderful.\n\nHubby had the veal parm a beautiful cutlet smothered with gravy and mozzarella and instead of the pasta he got garlic mash. We are garlic lovers and warning IN EVERYTHING THERE IS A LOT :) not too much for us. (yes there is a toooo much) \nThe garlic mash was a fresh skin on garlic, butter, a dash of cream, thick mash. It was how I make mine and it was delish.\n\nI ordered veal picatta. It was a thin cutlet not coated but very very tender in a heavenly picatta. A perfect blend of white wine, butter, EVOO, capers and just a dash of parsley. For my sub out of pasta I had mushroom risotto, it was EXTREMELY rich and creamy, on the firm side and full of fresh parm. The side dish dipped in my buttery dish wow................just wow.\n\nSlowly but gracefully we tried each others yumm'd and ahhhh'd......and at the end we forgot we were told to \"try the chocolate cannolis\" \n\nShe came by and we were all stuffed and happy but I asked anyway \"how big and how many are in an order lol\". She said \"just two and about like this\" (maybe 4\")\nCannolis were divine!!!!!! Perfect, rich crispy, creamy.\n\nThat was our experience! We were told about this place from Brian (owner of Wing King) who had his birthday dinner there the other night.\n\nThat's our experience! PS when I say gravy I mean tomato sauce :) Portions are large so I would split if you get an app. But always save room for a bite of cannoli!!!!!\n\nI'm so glad we came. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Next time I want to order a vegetarian dish that I saw and try a different app."

Mobsters in some movie stars are celebrated in the space\nDim lighting all around with a very unique menu light to see items on the menu is a scene  set for a nice romantic dinner\nOur server was outstanding, very knowledgeable , courteous and helpful with the menu. \nFood was ok but the service n ambience with the Magician  deserves a five star. \nRecommended highly \nOnly issue the yelp offer was not accepted  ???? Wonder why it's still on Yelp\nMgt needs to take it down That is the only reason to lose a star"

The singer is entertaining with a great voice and the food is DELICIOUS. I love the cheese bread and the Ravioli topped with Alfredo sauce. My Dad and step mom still talk about how much they love it, 2 years later. The ambiance is unique and quite \"Sinatra\", especially for out of town, southern guests:)"

            "review": "Dined at Capo's on Tuesday night because I have always heard about this place and saw that on Tuesday nights they have a Locals deal.\n\nFirst off, the place is really cool even from the moment you walk inside. Totally 1920's dark ambiance, mobster themed and it was really different and fun. They have a gentleman singing live music from the 1920's and a magician going around to the tables. It was a fun and unique dining experience. The only downside was having to wait almost 20 minutes for a table we had a reservation for.\n\nAs for the food, the table bread sucked which you would expect it to be at least warm and tasty from an Italian restaurant. Our server was very nice and I ordered a glass of wine which he forgot to put in and gave me two glasses for the price of one (Ill take a late drink any day for that). All entrees come with a soup or salad. Our server recommended the Cesar salad which I thought was sub-par and my entree actually came with an additional cesar salad on the plate with it so I would have preferred if he told me that and I would have gone with a soup as a starter instead. \n\nI had just watched a food network or travel channel show on off-menu special items in Las Vegas. Capo's has a secret menu item called \"Leftovers\" and it looked amazing on the show. So I ordered it. It was a really interesting dish and I can see why it is called the Leftovers. Its a grilled chabbata and cheese bread on the bottom with a mountain of sausage and sauce covering the bread with two fried eggs on top. I thought it was delicious. My husband ordered the chicken parm and it was so yummy I will probably get that next time.\n\nOverall, very cool place with good food. We will definitely be back, but most likely on Tuesday night because its a good deal."

The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection. \n\nWe did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals. \n\nThey did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that \"next time I just need to be aware\". Maybe I should've read more reviews or maybe they should mention that when calling to make reservations.  Either way there will be no next time for this patron."

We didn't have a reservation but got straight in , we had a 10 year old with us so they sat us in a side room closed off from the main part of the restaurant that had plenty of tables available. This was a let down considering we could hear the entertainment of live singing and music and everyone enjoying it while we were stuck in a extremely dark boring room watching the dishwasher through an open curtain. Apparently there not big on having kids in the establishment. It took our waitress about 10 min to take our drink order and then an additional 15 to come back to take our food order. We got our soup and salads shortly after which were not impressive at all but we were looking forward to our entrees...... 50 minutes later we were still sitting there in the dark with one other table with kids bored out our minds and starving. We asked our server how much longer it would be and were told \"2 minutes\",  ten minutes had gone by and the table aside of us who got there well after us received there meals first which were steaks and pastas! Obviously we were extremely frustrated at this point and told another server who was trying to pacify us by saying our food was coming out now that we were done with the situation and leaving. We offered to the manager to pay for our sodas and soups/salads and he treated us very rudely as if we were the problem saying our food was coming out in 2 minutes! We explained to him our frustration and he acted as if he could care less, he told the owners brother the situation n they both kept there backs turned to us not giving us an answer to how much we owed, they finally told us not to worry about it. In no way shape or form did they try to make our experience better or make up for the fact that our order had been placed literally over an hour ago n we had yet to receive our meal. We will never return!"

Once we found the right door, we rang the bell and a guy slides a little panel and asked if we have reservations. In other words, he wanted to know \"Who sent us!\" Hahaha. \n\nWhen you enter the actual restaurant, it's a the atmosphere dark, there is a bar with a piano across from it and then dining tables and booths. We were seated, then are server came out, he was very personable and attentive. When you open your menu, there is a little flashlight strung on top of it, this helps you see what you're ordering because of the dim lighting. \n\nApparently, they are famous for their meatballs, but I decided to save that for next visit since I was sure we would come back just from first impression. We got a bottle of  Mascanto. The boyfriend ordered the Veal. I ordered the Eggplant parm, which comes with your choice of salad I got the garden and for your side your choice of mashed potatoes or pasta, I got the pasta.\n\nEverything was amazing, I love the way the make their food. I have to say as someone who grew up eating Italian food their whole life I was impressed. This restaurant will be my go-to place for good Italian cuisine."

When you first walk in you have to press this door bell and they let you in by unconventional means. It was dark and had the authentic feel of a speakeasy. They give you a small flashlight to view the menu because it is so dark; it feels as if it was all lit by candlelight. The service was good and I went with my boyfriend and he got the singer to sing us a song so that is always a plus. To those who complain about the darkness or the attitude of employees.... you shouldn't go to a SPEAKEASY themed restaurant if you aren't prepared for the atmosphere and workers. The restaurant is pricey but worth it. I would recommend it as a place to go if you are on a date or celebrating with family and friends."

The side door entrance and questioning through the peephole started it off right. The wooden floors, red plush vinyl booths, damask velvet wallpaper and chandeliers were all great.  The entertainment (Frank Sinatra crooner) was a nice touch. It was only slightly awkward when he came up to the table and made direct eye contact causing me to stop my conversation mid-sentence to act like I was swooning.\n\nThe food was good but not anything to write home about. Kinda standard fare for higher than standard prices. If you tell yourself you're coming for the experience and entertainment then you can convince yourself the prices are alright. If you're visiting in town you probably budgeted for paying too much for everything anyway. If you're local... come for the 2 for one entree deal they have on Tuesdays.\n\n*If you want a nice booth near the entertainment you must request it when you make your reservation."

Has a great atmosphere, really kind of \"old School\", but in the best possible way!! I highly recommend this place.  One of the best Chicken Parms I have ever had. I really can not say enough good things about this place!!\nThe only bad point is the darkness and the flashlights on the menus, but that is part of the atmosphere so it is not that big of deal for me."

You have to ring the bell for access, but before they let you in they open the little window door and ask who you are....you know, like a Speakeasy....cute idea!\nPrerty dark inside (reason for the 4 not 5 stars). I like to see my food a little more. They have a Frank Sinatra type singer who makes the rounds to all the tables thru out the night. They also have a magician who was AWESOME!! Everyone really enjoyed their dinners! \nThe pasta is fresh made which is always a plus! I'm a picky vegitarian and my Linguini Ariabatti was excellent with just the right amount of spice. Angels with Dirty Faces (movie title) Angel Hair pasta w/peas,mushrooms, pepperoni w/a vodka type sauce. The chicken dish our friend had was also a winner!!! We'll definitely be returning to Capo's Speakeasy!"

It is further away from The Strip, but I supposed it keeps it a little more \"locals\" style which I like.  \n\nI did make reservations, and I do believe they are highly recommended, if not required. You go in through a side entrance and ring the doorbell. All the sudden a peep hole on the other side of the room opens and in true \"speakeasy\" fashion you are asked why you're here and I played along with the passcode from the website.  Then you're lead in through a door behind a payphone.\n\nVery dark inside so it does take a bit to adjust, but the menus come with flashlights if you need it.  The drinks we ordered were very good although I forget the names. We decided to forgo appetizers since we weren't starving. You do get bread and I had the soup with my meal.  The pasta and food was very high quality Italian. Sometimes you go to \"theme restaurants' and they skimp on the food, but that was NOT the case here.\n\nI loved the vibe, they had a singer doing Sinatra and a magician wandering around performing for the tables. It was amazing to see magic that close to you. \n\nI only wish we had a fridge at our hotel so I could continue snacking the rest of the night on this. Very filling. Very good. And worth the short drive from The Strip!"

My boyfriend is Italian so I have a tough critic when dining at an Italian restaurant. He was extremely pleased with the selection. \n\nI will be honest that I was a bit hesitant when I saw the location. Capo's is in a ghetto looking neighborhood within a strip mall, off the Vegas Strip. I guess that consoled myself that it would be worth a try when I saw Ruth Chris in the same type of setting, but a couple blocks back. \n\nThe entrance to the restaurant is quite fun and interesting. It is a simulated gangster hangout. You have to ring a door bell so that you can be let in. The restaurant itself is dark and you get a little light to read the menu. Capo's offers that very best service that I have seen at any restaurant. Jennine was our waitress and she was knowledgeable, attentive and looked happy to work at Capo's. The restaurant had a busboy, Jeremy who just worked his tail off and made sure that all the customers had all that they needed. \n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the lasagna as well as the egg drop soup with spinach. It was excellent. Taste, texture and temperature were outstanding. So far, Capo's is by far the best that we have had. \n\nIf only the restaurants on the strip could get the concept of great service and excellent food would they even be able to compete with Capo's."

Once on a terrible date that was only salvageable by the happy experience of Capo's, and two other times with my family and friends.  My mother loved it - said it reminded her of old Vegas and her boyfriend, super North NJ kind of guy said it reminded him of old Jersey.  So it's a coast to coast venue?  Dunno, but super Italiano.  Has Godfather, Casino, and Goodfellas and all those flicks randomly on in the background with subtitles.  Heavy Italian/Mafia decor and themes everywhere.  Crystal chandeliers, red booths, cherry/mahogany wood everywhere.  \n\nWarning: VERY subdued lighting.  The menus have little flashlights on them but they don't always work.  \n\nI've had the tortelloni entree which had a very rich, delicious cheese in a generous portion, the salad with giant meatballs (which kinda worked in a way... a little odd but I can't complain a bit about it), and the chicken Parmesan, which was also portioned very well and quite good.  \n\nThe waiters are all very slick and remind me of being home in NJ in the way that they speak.

The gentleman at the front door was excellent, he was very polite and funny.  Unfortunately he is the only staff member I am able to compliment.  The rest of the staff must of been having an off night.  The bar tenders were very short and rude, and our waitress was horrible.  We had a party of 7 and we must have waited 10 minutes alone for them to come say hi and take the drink order.  The gentleman from the door walked by and noticed no one had been at the table and I believe he went and said something,  but without him we may have waited 30 minutes for the waitress.  The waitress was unattentive and at one point just down right rude after she brought the bill and a gentleman from the table simply asked a question about the gratuity automatically being included into the bill.  She got upset and said \"well if you don't wanna tip me just don't pay that part\" and she proceeded to scratch out the gratuity line on the check, and all we wanted to know was what it was.  Like I mentioned the staff was not very friendly this particular night.  \n\nThe food was good, but maybe slightly overpriced.  That wasnt the end of the world though.  The restaurant ambiance was great, and all together it was a nice dinner.  If I ever go back I will make sure I get a different waitress."

I got a salad and they used way too much dressing.  I had to send back and ask for dressing on the side. The server was so nice and knew exactly when to come over to the table. The \"pink sauce\" (as they call it) was great with the meal and we even dipped the bread in it. Tried the cheesecake dessert and its not exactly what I'm used to but was also good. Reason not a 5 star: the restaurant opens at 5 and the piano player, which I think it a huge part of the atmosphere, didn't start playing until after 6. The food was a little over priced. Once you are seated the theme gets forgotten. No one is in character or there's not much going on besides a muted movie with the closed caption and the late piano player which we didn't get to enjoy much of."

The clams was soo over cooked it seem like I was chewing gum there. The paste was cover cooked. The sauce has a tiny bit of spicy which I didn't like. I didn't even finish 1/2 my plate. Took it to go. Hoping someone would eat it at home. nope ending up in the trash. Waste of $23.95  \n\nAlso ordered the Sausage Spaghetti plus extra $5.00 for a huge meatball. The paste was over cooked again, the meatball was soft, the sauce didn't taste good had a sweet but nasty bitter flavor, and the sausage was just ok nothing special.

The only nice thing, was the singer singing \"Sinatra\" songs.\"  This restaurant was dark,(they have tiny LED lights to view menu which are difficult to use if you have arthritis in your hands),  unfriendly,  terrible service, horrible food and were very DECEPTIVE with their bills. This was by far the worst eating experience of our lives. Caution to anyone who does not know the owners! The food was so bad I couldn't eat it. Who ever heard of Pasta Fagiola with crushed spaghetti, no beans and jarred garlic? The eggplant rolatini tasted like old cheese with jarred garlic overkill. I just couldn't eat it. The chicken picata was bland like lemon was squeezed on it. The mushroom risotto was hard and undercooked. My husband couldn't eat his eggplant either! No one enjoyed the food or the atmosphere. Then came the bill. LOCALS BEWARE! Sundays is pasta 2 for 1 (up to $20.00 only). If you don't tell them you're a local, you will be overcharged. Then there's the issue of the bill. It is a light carbon that is not ledgible! There were 2 prices on the bill (hand written). They charged us extra because they said they didn't know we were locals. Well, I let that go. I got back my adjusted bill and credit card back which had a transaction on it. Again it had 2 prices. $130. and $165.  I questioned the waiter again!  He said they included gratuity. Well, the \"gratuity box\" was blank and he wrote \"Grat\" over a preprinted \"Thankyou\" on the bill which was not ledgible. Also, it seemed to all of us that they charged OVER 20% for a TIP! People who don't know are going to be in for a rude surprise....Double tipping! We would never go back to Capo's again. My only mistake was complaining after the meal and paying for that horrible experience. All I got was an apology! Not a compensation by a long shot! And by the way, my bill originally started at $226. and went down to $130. which was still too much for the quality and service  received. Does anyone see a problem with a $96. difference? That's after having the waiter review with us 3 times as to what we were being charged for! I could not in good faith recommend this restaurant! If you're used to good Italian restaurants or Italian home cooking, you will hate this food! There was nothing authentic about it! This restaurant was way overpriced..."

My 72 year old aunt from Boston and her brother and sister who not to mention are iTALIAN and know there food, figured this would be the best place to dine in.   \nOf course the whole \"gangster mob\" theme is entertaining but the lighting is way too dark! Especially since we had three people over the age of 60 and eyesight is not great to begin with.\nWhen we got inside and got to the table to order drinks the table broke. understandable that accidents happen but we didn't get our drinks until the table was fixed which was 15 min later and not to mention the table was never fixed but we were moved.  They moved us into a whole  different side of the restaurant which was secluded from the dining area  which in some cases would be nice if your on a date but not in this situation.  My grandparents were so short they could barley see over the table top. We got our Cesar salads and it was so drenched with salad dressing and soggy it was unbearable to eat. We Ordered another salad with dressing on the Side and that couldn't even be done right.  So we all ordered the veil parm and to start off  it tasted more like a flattened piece of chicken. Did not get a choice of pasta it was strictly spaghetti and extra cost if you wanted a different style. They pretty much had it pre made and under a heat lamp waiting to be served. The spaghetti was literally only 4oz.  I asked to return the dish and the waitress said no it can't be done and instead brought me a dessert.  I had told her I did not eat dessert and she had said to me sorry that's all you can get.  All I wanted was my $30 refunded off my bill.  Needles to say we had spent $60 on a groupon and our bill came out to $200 so it's not like we were getting our meal for free. So I don't think that anyone should be treated different for having a coupon.   It was sad to see such horrible service at a place with such potential, maybe it was because they were just too busy and overwhelmed.  But this visit was not enjoyable and would not recommend to any of my friends at this point."

We planned this or so my wife had it planned prior to leaving Vegas to check this place.  This was unusually old school 20's style , mafia theme restaurant.  We got there when it opened at 11 am and have ring the doorbell ... It's funny the waiter would open a peep window and look and let us in.  Just like how the mafias back in the 20's were.  Lol it was kind of dark inside, lots of poster of former Mafiosos and big bosses such as Capone, lucky Luciano and so on.  All these time i was there I was expecting to be gun downed by a rival mafia lol.  It was really an original setting with a touch of Italy !!!! Or should I say Sicily .,,,\n\nThe waiter and waitress were dressed non black... The make attendants wore white suspenders.... Just like what machine gun kelly would look back then.\n\nAny way we got our food, it was a full lunch meal with salad as starter and bread, I had me a \"vinny\" chicken Parmesan.  It was pretty good.  Hey if you ever be in Vegas and want to feel like the mafia is around you ... Come to this place ..."

The man yells at us \"What do you want?\" followed by us looking terrified and wondering if we are at a restaurant or in a sketchy place. Then a door opens out of nowhere and we are led inside to an old, italian, speakeasy bar. The decor is awesome! Frank Sinatra is playing, the windows are barred with mirrors, and the entire place is dark. \n\nWe begin with a nice glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. The server's recommendation is spot on! We had the Ravioli, Fettucine Alfredo, and the Lasagna. Our entrees came with fresh bread with an amazing herb butter and a generous salad. My boyfriend's ravioli were huge! They were very tasty with a ricotta cheese filling. My lasagna was really good, and the tomato sauce was sweet. My friend had the fettucine. He didn't share and he scarfed it up, down to the last noodle, before I could try it! I guess he liked it. The bar looked really cool but we sat in the red booths because I love booths! Service was excellent, however, the place was quite slow for a Friday night, perhaps because we were eating at 10pm. My friend loves mafia movies so he took a liking to this place. The prices were moderate. We'd love to return when we are in the area again to try out their bar and catch live music next time."

Dimly lit with an abundance of red leather/vinyl semi circle banquettes, plus tables for dining.  Chandeliers over the tables were for effect not a light source.  Singer was going through the motions but his voice could not be discerned from his accompanying music track, he stood behind the piano but never did play while we were there. Magician doing table magic was entertaining and capable.\nWe had four diners and four different entr\u00e9es from Angels with dirty faces, sleeps with the fishes, Vinnys ala vodka with an added meatball (+5$)and the lasagna.  All diners were very pleased with the food, flavorful and ample servings.  Tiramisu and choc covered cannolis were better than average, cappuccino was very small and not as hot as it should have been--- needed to have the cup prewarmend. Cocktails are spendy, but alas we are in Vegas.\nWorth a visit"

There are few lights on, so you can't entirely tell if it is open or night, and it was a little confusing as to where the entrance, until I saw the giant \"entrance\" sign. \n\nI agree with the other reviews about the fun speakeasy entrance. \n\nWe were walked to out booth, but I had to watch a few spots because it seems like the wood floor is starting to rot in spots. But you can't see it because the place is very dimly lit. There was music playing and a Sinatra-ish live singer. The music was on the loud side, but good. \n\nWe were given menus, and then realized that a simple spaghetti is $18. And if you want to share it, they want to charge you an additional $6. The spaghetti is basically the cheapest thing on the menu besides appetizers. We decided this place was out of our price range and left before we even tried any of the food.  I was a little bummed cause the atmosphere was fun, but that is just too much to pay for a little bit of pasta."

The menu's come with small LED flashlights to read them.\nAs usual we get the \"forgetful\" server but had I would imagine a floor Manager check on us and she got our drinks right away and no issues after that. The bread is ok, not their home made but was warm and the garlic butter was good. We tried the Caesar salad with pasta and meatballs. Its a different combination and now we can say we tried it and something different next time.\nMy wife's eggplant was very good and that is her signature dish to try when we go out. My Spaghetti and Meatballs was good (not the best I have ever had and not the worst).

It was extremely dark. How dark? The some of the menus had flashlights attached to them.\n\nThey had a live performer singing and playing the piano which I thought was a nice touch.\n\n\nFood:\nI really wish I could say I enjoyed the food here. Maybe it was because we came on a Sunday night or it was just an off night for them but I was not impressed at all. Food was comparable to your local Olive Garden.\n\nWe ordered the calamari for an appetizer. My comment about it being comparable to Olive Garden might be harsh but this dish is exactly why I said it. The color and texture both reminded me of the calamari at Olive Garden.\n\nOur main dishes were the Vinne's Alla Vodka and Santucci's Pasta. \n\nSantucci's Pasta was very plain. I don't understand the hype about Capone's sauce. Short of them accidentally serving us another sauce on it I was not impressed.\n\nVinne's Alla Vodka was just disappointing. I'm a sucker for Vodka sauce so I hoped this would be the saving grace. It wasn't. The penne taste like it was only half cooked.\n\n\nService:\nThrough it all I can honestly say it was the service that saved this from dropping to a two. Our waitress was absolutely amazing. She gave us a heads up about wait times and when were done even offered to call us a cab. Unfortunately we weren't the only tourists there and kept getting our cabs stolen by other patrons.\n\n11pm came around and our waitress saw we were still waiting outside. The restaurant closed at 10pm. She waited with us until our cab came and got us.\n\n\nOverall:\nI don't plan on going back. One and done was enough for me."

When you walk in the front door, you enter in a little vestibule area with no windows, no doorknobs (that work), and a camera in the corner. A little screen slides open and the guy asks you what you want, kinda like a speakeasy. When you enter the actual restaurant, it's very dark (so dark, in fact, that the menus have little flashlights attached to them) but decorated well. \n\nI went there with a group of people. We were supposed to meet at 8:00, but not everyone showed up until about 8:45. To kill time, the few of us who were there decided to wait at the bar. After a few drinks, the bartender let us know that appetizers at the bar were half off. Sounded like a good deal, so I ordered the calamari, which was $14.99. The bill was non-transferable, so when enough of our party showed up to be seated, we asked to close out our tab. This was the first shady part:\n\nBartender: That'll be $10.82\nMe: I thought the calamari was $14.99?\nBartender: It is.\nMe: Didn't you tell us appetizers were half off?\nBartender: Well the calamari is $10.\nMe: (Puzzled look)\nBartender: Ok fine. Umm...just give me $8.\n\nWe sit down at the table and look over the menu. Everything is typical Italian, but I really got sticker shock when I saw the prices. Entree prices averaged around $24, which wouldn't be that crazy for a fine dining venue, but this really didn't strike me as such a place. Anyhow, the calamari had really taken the edge off, so my girlfriend and I decided to split an entree. We ordered the veal parmigiana, which was $28.99. \n\nWhen we ordered our food, it was just after 9:00. When we got our food, it was just before 10:00. Granted there were 10 people in our group, but we were the only people in the place, literally. I don't know what they were doing, but I can't remember the last time my food took that long, even in crowded restaurants. I don't think I would have normally gotten so irritated, but I had gotten up at 3:30 for work that morning and had to wake up at 6:00 the next morning, so I had been antsy to get home and go to sleep.\n\nWhen finally get our food, I ask for a separate check. I admit, I had forgotten to ask for it up front, but all the other restaurants I've been to in this town dodn't have problems splitting the check up post-meal, so I didn't think they would either.\n\nMe: Excuse me, I need to leave soon. Could I pay for my meal now?\nWaitress: I'm sorry, but we can't split the bill after it's been created.\nMe: Oh, OK. Well could you please charge the amount of my meal to my card and apply it towards the bill? (I hold my credit card out)\nWaitress: We can only take two cards per bill, so only one other card can be used.\nMe: OK, well I know the rest of the people have cash, so I'm alright with this.\nWaitress: Fine. Let me figure out what your total is.\n\n--about 5 minutes pass--\n\nWaitress: You're total is $36.xx.\nMe: $36.xx?? What was the gratuity? I thought the veal was $28.99?\nWaitress: You two split the meal. There's a $4 split charge.\nMe: You didn't tell us about that when we ordered.\nWaitress: It's on the menu. Here, see? (She was right. The $4 split charge was indicated, but it was on the back page underneath the desserts. Since we hadn't gotten to desserts yet, we hadn't looked at the back page.)\nMe: OK, you're right, but why didn't you tell us about this when we ordered?\nWaitress: It's on the menu, so we don't tell people about it.\nMe: So when someone is asking for something and will be unknowingly charged extra, you don't think it's appropriate to let them know?\nWaitress: Nope. We're not allowed to tell people about it. \nMe: Not allowed??\nWaitress: Nope. The owner says we're not allowed to tell people about it.\nMe: That's really shady.\nJen: Could we speak to the manager?\nWaitress: I am the manager. \nJen: Well then can we speak to whoever you report to?\nWaitress: He's not here.\nJen: Well then how does your restaurant handle customer service?\nWaitress: Fine, I'll take the $4 off.\n\nThe waitress is gone for about 10 minutes doing who knows what. In the mean time, we're eating our veal, and it was mediocre at best. I would say the meat was maybe a couple millimeters thick with twice as much breading. The pasta sauce was lacking and nothing worth going back for. I gotta say, accounting for the cost and quality, you would get an exponentially better deal at Olive Garden. \n\nShe finally came back with our check, $31.30, and I paid. It seemed like everything worked out. However, after charging my card, she didn't stick around long enough for us to ask for a to-go container. We waited for about 10 minutes before my girlfriend decided to just go ask for one. She walked over to where the kitchen entrance/waitress station was, poked her head in, and said \"Excuse me.\" When the waitress saw her, she jumped around a corner. Literally. Our waitress ran away. \n\nThe service was shady and the food was mediocre. I would only recommend this place to someone for drinks."

As far as the food I was not expressed at all order the bruschetta and it was so small the amount of bread to tomatoes was horrible. A small little saucer my 1 year old would not be satisfied. \nWe ordered pastas my husbands sauce was decent but pasta and shrimp were both way under cooked. \nMy pasta was meant to have an Alfredo sauce and it was just oil. I ordered a side of Alfredo and it was so watery I didn't eat it. \n2bartender behind the bar and very slow service. \nAlthough the girl with the red shirt was helpful when u could get her attention as she was busy and taking care of everyone while the other girl was doing nothing. \nI was very disappoint I have heard so many good things about this place.

The calamari is outstanding. We had rude service the first time from a bartender that clearly didn't want to be a bartender and the 3rd time had a young girl who was just as surly and knew nothing about the food and had an attitude.  I can't recommend Capo and we won't be returning.  Casa di Amore also has great atmosphere, food and fantastic friendly service so if you are looking for someplace off the strip with similar food/pricing/music this is a much better choice in my opinion."

Dinner was ok. Got the check & because they do not do separate checks we all calculated our portion of the bill. I ordered a $45 bottle of wine but when the bill was presented it showed $75. Brought it to the attention of the waitress & she said \"I presented the bottle to you\". I am sorry but if I order a bottle of wine I assume she is presenting the one I ordered! We asked for the wine list & pointed to the one we ordered. The one she presented to us was three selections down. She took our complaint to her boss & she referred it to the top boss. His response was \" well that table over there could say the same thing & they would be out $30 dollars.\" They took $15 off the check but it wasn't enough. Wine is marked up 100%, management would have broken even but they ruined the evening. There are too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to spend your\n money here!"

Upon arrival, we asked about separate tickets because most of the 12 were on expense accounts and needed receipts.  We were told their policy was a maximum of two cards.  When the issue was brought up, they agreed to accept 4 cards, all others needed to pay cash.  I won't speculate on reasons for this policy but we didn't have cash and we weren't one of the ones needing a receipt, so we left. We are very disappointed as we have introduced a significant number of people to this restaurant.  We can no longer recommend them based on their inability to accommodate business needs. We are searching for a new Italian restaurant that we can recommend to out of town diners."

Well, there's not a lot of authentic vintage left in this town, so we settled for fabricated vintage instead.  Luckily someone I know started talking about this place and it piqued my interest.  After further research on Yelp, I was sold.\n\nThe idea for Capo's is that you are in a speakeasy from the 1930's.  Back entryways, secret doors, dim lighting... it all makes for a fun and interesting atmosphere.  Our friends were especially impressed since we surprised them with our restaurant selection.\n\nWhen you get into the restaurant, be prepared for the dim lighting- they really aren't kidding here.  It was still daylight outside when we got to the restaurant and it took my eyes several minutes to adjust.  But they keep the idea fun and even give you little flashlights on your menu to help you read it if necessary.\n\nThe seating is posh and comfortable and I love the chandeliers above every table.  The tables are large enough for a party of four (like ours) to have a good time, but still intimate enough for all you Romeos out there.  At 6 o'clock they have a singer that performs old Sinatra songs and the like.  He was a great guy that not only sang well, but also chats up the diners and later dedicates songs to them.  My girlfriend and I had \"Unforgettable\" dedicated to us.  Needless to say, I felt pretty special.\n\nAs for the meal, they start you off with bread and garlic butter.  The butter was tasty, but like other reviewers said the bread hardens up pretty quickly.  Not really sure how this is possible, but it's true.  It's not inedible but just not as yummy as when they first bring it out.\n\nThe salads were great and vinaigrette dressing was delicious.  The veggies were fresh and I loved the little artichoke heart they throw in for good measure (but I'm a sucker for artichokes).\n\nI ordered the Vodka Penne and it was so good I'm still thinking about it.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a lot of flavor.  I was very happy with my entree.\n\nTwo others in my party ordered the pasta with alfredo and another ordered the stuffed chicken.  Everyone else said their entrees were good, but I don't think they liked them as well as I liked mine.\n\nOur waitress was fantastic- super friendly and checked up on us just enough.  She was also more than happy to bring out a special cake that our friends had made for us and even lit a candle on it.  The other employees we met were really friendly as well.\n\nThe few cons:\n-bread could be better and perhaps a couple of entrees as well\n-for how nice the dining area is, the bathroom made me a little sad\n-I didn't like walking through a smokers lounge to get back outside\n-it was too warm in the restaurant- not sure if the air was broken or they were going for the speakeasy atmosphere, but the temperature needed to be turned down about 5 degrees (and I'm always cold, so you know it has to be warm for me to say something)\n-the food is a little overpriced\n\nI'm going with five stars since this was overall a very memorable experience for me.  Between the employees, the singer, the food, and the atmosphere I definitely have plans to come back."

Some of the best Italian I've had in Vegas. I will 110% return to capo's. Next time I want to try the steak. We had the calamari appetizer. Meatball appetizer (as a meal), chicken parm (no knife needed to cut the chicken) and the sawed off sausage pepper & onions (sauce was unreal) everything was perfect. Our server, Jeremy was great! And they kept the water coming! Never did I have an empty glass. Again. This place was a hard 10!"

Great start so far.  Walked around, took photos, and went to enter.  Pushed the button, and sure enough, a young guy slides open the \"visual door\", and tells us to \"get in here\".  Wall/door swings open, and our senses are indulged with the ambiance.  Speaking of ambiance, there is no one word to describe Capo's.  You say something about the food, you miss the atmosphere.  You say about the atmosphere, you miss the employees.  You get the idea.\n\nWe are seated in a booth, and the darkness of the place just exudes speak-easy.  The smells from the kitchen tell us we chose wisely.  When our waiter arrives, we ask about the 2-for, and he tells us that is't $20 off the second entree for dinner.  Lunch now?  We decide to see the dinner menu, and that was the right decision.  Each menu had a little flashlight attached to it, as yes, it is that dark.  We order, then sit back and soak in the feel.  \n\nI had to use the facilities, and when I returned, the guy that gave directions was also the singer.  Very friendly/talkative, and when I told him it was our anniversary (celebrating a bit late), he offered to sing a song or 2 for us.  That was very special.  The song?  \"Unforgettable\".\n\nFood arrives, and our taste buds could not wait.  Wife had the ravioli, and I the spaghetti with veggie ball.  One bite, and we are in love with Capo's.  You know when you read/hear/watch a review, and you think that might work?  MFF was so far off........  it was that good.  NO, it was that excellent!!!  The cheese in wife's ravioli melted in her mouth, it was so smooth.  Was my meatball really veggie?  There was a heft to it that was never experienced before.  I don't know if they put something extra in it, as I was on gastro-relaxation for the next few hours.\n\nAnd......  another song for us before we left.\n\nCapo's, know that on future trips to Vegas, we plan on visiting you over and over.\n\nI wonder how good lunch is?????"

Go West on Tropicana and you're there in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe beauty is in the details at Capo's. When you arrive, you walk into a small vestibule. Soon, a small window slides open and a slightly frightening italian man asks what you want. If you manage to convince him you deserve entrance (don't worry- you will), he disappears, only to reappear shortly thereafter to open the door wide, allowing you into the dimly lit restaurant. The chairs and booths are comfortable. The music is fun and often sung by a guy trying for all his might to be Sinatra. Old ganster movies such as the OG Ocean's 11 are playing on a large flatscreen above the bar. The walls are decorated with pictures of infamous mobsters and the boothes are all red velvet and leather.\n\nThe food. My. God. The. Food. Take a lactaide before you get there- these people are serious about cheese. And garlic. This is everything you love but know you shouldn't about Italian cusine. I highly recommend the bruschetta (a beautiful harmony of tomatoes, onion and pesto with a bit of a kick) and \"The Chef Sleeps with da Fishes\" (an alfredo dish with at least a dozen large, tender shirmp swimming in creamy cheesey goodness). \n\nThis is a great place for groups and families. We had a party of 25 including 5 children and 4 teenagers. Everyone LOVED both the food and the ambiance. There was another large group of about 20 and we had absolutely NO problem with service. Everyone was very attentive with the doorman, waiter, busboy and party planner all coming by to make sure everyone was taken care of. \n\nThe skinny:\nCredit cards are accepted.\nEntrees range from $10.50 for spaghetti w/ meatballs to $25 for specialty dishes\nSeveral desserts are available for about $7 each\nFull bar and good wine selection available\nReservations are HIGHLY recommended as the place is not big\n\n**Important note: If you have a group of 15 or more you will have to have a set menu, where everyone pays the same price, starting at about $35 p/p. Children under ten are half price."

The meatball appetizer is terrific, and everyone was happy with their meals. Desert was also top notch with the cannoli. Here's the one rub, and it's annoying. Because we had 8 of us, the 18% tip is included. That's fair, but I have to say that our waitress was below par. Inattentive, and lacking instincts to determine some basic needs that we had were annoying, but literally having to have other servers find her for us was aggravating. She seemed to lack training and her work ethic was marginal. I still say come for the food and atmosphere, but beware that automatic tipping leads to unmotivated waitresses on occasion."

I don't really wanna give away the experience. But you should make reservations if you go on a weekend. It definitely is a possibility it may be crowded - It opens at 5pm till late night. \nOk so here's the deal without giving away the experience. You walk in and .............. We'll skip ahead to eating there - it definitely is worth it though. Funny thing is that I was reading over some past reviews and either people had a great time here or it REALLY Sucked. Sometimes restaurants go through staffing issues...But definitely had a good time here. Just remember to \"speak easy\" if you know what I mean!\nThe ambiance is dark and romantic. With an old Vegas feel to it. It's got these private booths and family tables. We got the Bugsy Segal Booth. There's a guy walking around singing old Rat Pack/Chicago -Italian style songs from \"That's Amore\" - \"Ain't that a kick in the head. \nThe service was friendly from EVERYONE! The decor is kinda Mob-like. The food was pretty good almost home cooked. The pasta I had was \"Swim with Fishes\" or something like that had a light cheese cream sauce with garlic and sundried tomatoes swimming in al dente fettucinni and shrimp.  \"Bust a cap\" stuffed mushrooms were fantastic - sure they were little mushrooms but they did pack it with flavor. The italian egg drop soup was good. Very garlicky but a little salty for me. When they say garlic mashed potatoes...they don't mess around.\nGARLIC!!!!\nThey had this chicken too kinda with picatta sauce and capers but it had broccoli. This thing was packed with flavor.\nOk so great ambiance,  great date place, friendly staff, good food. Definitely wanna come back!"

We instantly relaxed in Capo's and loved all the vintage 50's design, chandeliers, pictures of gangsters, and famous musicians. \n\nI ordered the bruschetta for starters and I couldn't get enough. There was so much flavor! Before my main dish, came a yummy salad with tender greens and rich, creamy garlic dressic. I may or may not have licked the plate after finishing the salad. For my main dish, I got the The Chef Sleeps with Fishes and it was one of the best pastas I've ever had! Very tender shrimp and big chunks of prosciutto was amazing with the rich garlic pasta sauce. I ordered the pasta sanz sun dried tomatoes because I don't really like the sweetness and it was perfect. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the cheesecake and ordered it with both chocolate and strawberry sauce.

One of my friends knew the words to \"On the Street Where You Live,\" which led to a duet!  The place is really dark, so they attach little LED flashlights to the menus.  Portion sizes were generous. One friend had a simple dish of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce, and another had the same with Italian sausage added. Both said their dishes were \"excellent\". Another friend gave two thumbs up on the shrimp scampi. I tried the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, and as noted in other reviews it was peppery with lots of raw slivered garlic. Caution: you WILL smell like garlic the next day if you order this dish!  Prices were very good. No, it's not the world's best Italian food, but the total experience is very very enjoyable.  From the Strip, it's about a $15 cab fare for a party of 4."

It comes with a side of spaghetti. There was no grated cheese offered. Something unheard of in a supposedly Italian restaurant. Did I say my Aunt and Cousin are from South Philly so we know Italian. My wife ordered the \"signature\"clams and spaghetti in Red sauce. She got clams in white sauce. My Cousin ordered shrimp scampi. Not spicey. She got extra spicey. We learned later her scami went to another table. The guest of honor, my Aunt, ordered spaghetti and sausage which she didn't get. It evidently got lost in the kitchen. The waitress was very apologetic and in fairness they did take off 2 entries from our bill. But the evening was ruined. If this was a real \"speakeasy\" the chef and owner would have been taken away in a car trunk. I'll be skipping anymore visits to this seudo Italian restaurant any time soon."

Also, we were seated right next to the singer and, while he was good, it was rather intrusive to be so close to him.  Lastly, while the food was good.. it wasn't stupendous.\n\nNow, for what we liked.. the ambiance (other than the lighting) was good.  Service was great.  Food was good.  Prices seemed reasonable.  And.. the singer was staying in key most of the time.\n\nWe ordered the antipasto - rather excellent.  Our salads (with italian dressing) were boring afterwards, a bit too much lettuce since the antipasto was a salad also.  The bread was good, but they were stingy with the butter.  My entree was \"The Chef Sleeps with the Fishes\", a shrimp fettucine that I liked.  Hubby's entree was \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", angel hair pasta with pepperoni, peas, mushrooms & pink sauce.. also good.  We had enough leftovers for a couple more meals also.\n\nWould we return?

The dining experience itself: not so much.\n\nI had to laugh when reading \"Steakhouse\" on the menu because there just weren't that many steak options. Shrimp caught my eye in a few dishes, and the clams did also. We'd heard great things about the meatballs but I wanted seafood. It's an Italian place, right? Seafood and pasta sound easy enough.\n\nUnfortunately, by 6 in the evening they were out of shrimp.  Choice number 2 wasn't a bad one though. I had the \"Gallows with clams\" in a red sauce. It was good and had a lot of clams. The sauce was tasty. Would have been good if I'd shared it over my husband's alfredo, because that was terrible. Flavorless sauce.  His meatball however was excellent. And very large; and tender! Exploding with flavor inside! I doubt we'll return here but it was fun to check out! I'd go with my clams again and he'd probably throw a meatball on top and share.  :)\n\nA salad with a red sauce preceeded dinner and was very good. (Husband disliked the sauce). A tiramisu dessert finished up the evening and it was great too!\n\nWe had a Groupon but it still wasn't an inexpensive dinner, for what it was. You're partly paying for the experience though. It was fun dining in the dark. Service has room for improvement! We first heard about the place from a fake reality show that supposedly took place there. I wish Food Network would stop airing that crap, but I'm glad we had a chance to check out one of the places it supposedly featured! \n\nIf this restaurant fails I highly suggest the owner start a meatball production factory - freeze 'em and ship out! You have a guaranteed customer in California waiting for this day!"

One of their signature dishes. 3 types of meat rolled up sitting in a hearty tomato sauce. The stuffed mushrooms topped with mozzarella cheese is simply delish!! The gooey cheese stretches just like a freshly baked cheese pizza when being served. Calamari is crisp with a nice golden brown hue. They are not too oily or greasy tasting at all. Even the complimentary Italian style bread served is fantastic!! \n\nThe Ambiance:\nDark but lively place with a mafia memorabilia decor in good taste. Live music daily with a piano bar and Sinatra tunes sung with true heart! If you are lucky, you might get to hear the manager belt out a few tunes on the piano. Very talented player!! \n\nThe bar hosts daily regulars who are staples of the establishment since the early days of Capo's existence. They are warm, friendly and are from the era that will buy a lady a drink out of pure etiquette. :)\n\nExcellent service, great drinks (try the red wine Sangria) and even the coffee is darn good because they use Lavazza.

Last Saturday our daughter was spending the afternoon with her grandparents so we jumped at the opportunity to have a proper date. \n\nCapos was not really on our radar and it wasn't until we drove past it on our way back from doing some decorating at his office that we decided Italian sounded great. We turned around and got into the parking lot of Capos.\n\nI have to say that I really like the feel and the ambiance of this place. Although it is very dark when you first walk in so make sure to allow time for your eyes to adjust. My husband made a comment that this was the type of place one would bring their mistress. It was dark with high red booths offering privacy and comfort. \n\nOur server was excellent. She was knowledgable, friendly and energetic. She took our drink orders promptly after we were seated. They do have a happy hour menu mon-sat but it is only at the bar.\n\nWe opted for one cocktail each... They ranged between $12-14 per.\n\nWe started off with their fresh calamari which was lightly battered and complemented by sliced Peperoncinis for that added zest. $14,95\n\nFor my entree  I opted for \"Angels a With Dirty Faces\" which was angel hair pasta in pink sauce with peas and mushrooms. I added grilled chicken for an extra fee. $18.95 + $6 for the chicken to be added\n\nMy husband had \"Racketeers Ravioli\" which were homemade pasta pillows stuffed with ricotta cheese and he opted for Alfredo sauce as the topping sauce of choice. The ravioli tasted homemade and exactly the way my mom used to make them.  $18.95\n\nWe overheard the server explain to a booth behind us that nothing in house is frozen or pre made. She stated that they have a small freezer which houses some of the desserts. That is what I like to hear. You pay the premium for it, but that's what I like to hear.\n\nAll entrees come with a choice of soup or salad. I loved their garlic sauce that was on my salad. So delicious!!\n\nThe only con were the prices. Even with 2 for 1 entree for locals, we ended up shelling over $70 for the two of us. \n\nAlthough the food and service were great, I am not thrilled with the price point enough to rush back. I can see the prices being justified because everything is made fresh and portions are fair, but Italian food ingridients generally don't warrant that kind of price unless we are adding seafood, etc."

Not enough to have any leftovers, which I thought was cheap for the prices they charge.\n\nOverall, it was a little below average.  I won't be back."

Then for the most important parts of a reataurant, the food and service...it took about 45 minutes for our 2 dishes to come out and we had to flag down someone each time we needed refills on our waters. Then the food finally came out...lasagna and shrimp scampi...2 of the most recommended dishes from the staff. The scampi had clearly been sitting under the lamp for a long time and was hard and crusty on top and the shrimp was rubbery and dry. It looked nothing at all like all the delicious pictures in reviews on yelp. It was simply a pile of butter with hard angel hair and over done shrimp with a touch of spiciness. No lemon or garlic flavor at all like the menu said. The lasagna was also very dry. The server was nice but was very busy and kind of forced to  neglect us as we were only a party of 2 and he had a huge party of 14 come in right after us. The manager was hanging out at the bar sipping wine the whole night while our server who seemed to be the only one working was running his ass off. Then we had to wait about 10 minutes after our plates we're cleared just to get our bill. $56 for 2 dishes and no alcohol. Waaaaaay overpriced for such bad food. Won't be going back. Great atmosphere and all but horrible food and service and way overpriced. They nailed everything except the 2 most important parts of a restaurant, the food and service. 2 stars just because I loved the entrance and atmosphere. If there were separate categories to rate I would give this 5 stars and the food and service 0 stars."

The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! He had lasagna and I had chicken marsala with a side of mushroom risotto. The chicken was so tender I barely needed a butter knife. Everything was wonderful and the dark restaurant with the half moon red leather booths with the chandeliers above them really set a romantic mood.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks."

I expected to wait some time for a table which just made for more conversation time with friends.  We made our way to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks that were well made and just strong enough.  The ambience was evocative of what I think a \"speakeasy\" would have  been in the 20s or 30s.  There are pictures on the walls of various notorious pre-WWII gangsters.  There was a gentleman performing karaoke to classic Sinatra, Martin, Bennett and other crooners.  He was, for the most part, right on.  \n\nEventually, we made our way to a booth to eat.  In our group we ordered Veal, salmon, lasagna and arrabiata pasta.  We started with an appetizer of caprese which was very good.  A large section of mozzarella, thick slice of tomato and a good dose of balsamic vinegar.  I would have preferred more basil, but I'm really partial to basil.  Our meals were delicious.  The protions were good, but not overwhelming.  With our appetizer, bread, and soup or salad before the meal there was enough to take home after eating sensibly.  \n\nThe server was attentive without being overbearing.  Our waters were consistently refilled without request.  All in all a great evening of food, service and ambience.  I look forward to going back."

When we arrived (slightly on the early side for dinner bc we had a Cirque show to catch) the lot was empty and not a soul in site. When we entered, it was dark and the front door was locked so we rang the buzzer. Quickly a speak easy opened to our right and an Italian chap said, \"state your business\"...fumbling over our words we managed to spit out \"we would like to have dinner if you're open\". He slams the window shut and minutes later the front door opens and he says, \"follow me\". We had no idea this was part of their shtick. It was so dark inside that our eyes were having a hard time adjusting. Once they did, we immediately felt like we were tossed back into the good ole brat pack days. There was a gentleman singing Sinatra and Martin songs. The good was great. We ordered Caesar Salad, carbonara, and their meatballs which were the best we've had. Ask about the cooking process and you'll understand why. Great sangria too. The service was incredibly attentive. We've sent many people here and they too all love the shtick at the door as well as the food and ambiance. Well worth the cab ride over."

            "review": "Full disclosure: I've been wanting to eat here for at least a year. Capo's owner, Nico Santucci, randomly followed me on Twitter so I took a look into what he was all about when I discovered Capo's. A mob themed Italian restaurant with a speakeasy style entrance? Sold! After finally getting to dine here,  I can say it exceeded everyone of my expectations. I had a reso for 5:30 (highly recommended BTW) and got in using the password (found on their website). It was cool to play along with the door man (apparently I had Auntie G's money) but when we got in he was so nice. It is very dark in there so watch your step. Our table was near the bar but you can see the kitchen so it was a bit brighter than if you sat near the back. Our server, Brandon, was very good, very attentive. One of the ways I judge a restaurant's service is how often my water glass gets filled. Never got below halfway so zero complaints. The food? Unbelievable. I had the Chicken Anastasia with a side of spaghetti. My companion had the lasagna. The Anastasia was perfect. The pink sauce was rich and the chicken was tender. My companion said the lasagna was the best she's ever had by a wide margin. They absolutely do not skimp on the ingredients. I had a bite of the lasagna and it was an explosion of cheese.  The Capone's Secret Sauce was a wise investment by Mr. Santucci. It is absolutely delicious (just ask Adam Richman) There is live entertainment here with a gentleman singing Sinatra tunes. So between the dark vibe and the singing it makes for a great atmosphere. However, be sure to ask to sit closer to the back of the restaurant where it's quieter as the bartenders chatter can take you out of your zone. My companion can be picky so I was afraid she wouldn't care for it but nope. She loved it. Capo's is a place we will be visiting every time I'm in Vegas. Buon Appetito!"

The place is not very big with a 6 or 8 seat bar, a small area to wait for a table, a main dinning room with 8 booths or so and about 10 dining tables.  There is a small dance floor but it is more for the singer than for dancing.  There is a second room for large groups or overflow seating but it was not air conditioned the night we came.....and I can not imagine trying to dine in there with temps about 15 degrees higher than the restaurant.  My only real complaint is that the temp in the dining room was about 76 degrees and it felt a little stuffy and warm.\n\n1.  Make a reservation.\n2.  Ask for a booth\n3.  Be willing to play along\n4.  Have a martini or two\n5.  The \"Sinatra\" singer is actually really good and he smelled nice too.\n6.  Use your cell phone flashlight instead of the mini flash lights they give you to read the menu.\n7.  A candelabra on your cell phone can be a nice touch on your table\n8.  Go for it.

            "review": "My flight arrived at 7 p.m., and after a month-long sojourn in the Garden State, I was ready to reclaim Vegas.  Hubby picked me up at the airport and suggested Capo's.  He can't resist a deal, and Tuesdays it's 2 for 1.  In fact, right under the tall restaurant sign facing East, it proclaims in big letters, not to be missed by any local OR tourist, \"2 for 1 Tuesdays.\"  But more about that later.\n\nWe had a reservation and arrived a bit early, so we had to wait.  And wait some more.  So we got to hang out near the bar, with every seat filled by jocks drinking and shouting at various sports on the TVs.  No matter that the Vice Presidential debate was being aired, but not here.  I won't ding them for that, since most people wouldn't care. \n\nAt last we were seated, but our table was at one of the booths lining the bar, not in the main dining room.  That meant hearing the clanging pots from the kitchen right behind the bar, along with the aforementioned shouting jocks.  A very short while later, I noticed that the couple who walked in right in front of us, who did not have reservations, were seated immediately after us in a nice, quiet room right off the main dining room.  Normally, I would have insisted on another table, but I was exhausted from my sleepless flight.  I was still on East Coast time and it was late, even for me.\n\nIt took quite a while for the server to come over.  He apologized, but it was indicative of the service through the rest of the meal.  Not terrible, but not attentive enough, and certainly not as good as what we'd experienced here in the past.\n\nPrices have really increased.  Yeah, Capo's is higher end, but it's not the Strip.  At least the Sangria I ordered was a good-sized glass and was very tasty.  But the copious amount of fruit turned out to be just lemon, lime and orange peel and pith.  And the dishes are served with salad or soup, and a choice of side, so it's not all that bad.\n\nMy husband had Chicken Lucchese, with mushroom risotto as his side dish.  His chicken was a very large portion covered with mozzarella, mushrooms, capers and broccoli.  My Chicken Picatta, on the other hand, was half that size.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so this time it was enough for me to still take home some of it, but the discrepancy in size was insane, especially since his had so much more stuff on it.  And was only priced at $1 more.\n\nWhen it came time to pack up the leftovers, we were provided with boxes.  I usually like to box up my food myself.  But in this case, the plates were huge and heavy, and both had drippy sauce.  After I took care of mine, Herb put that plate on one corner of the table, along with our bread plates.  There was no room to maneuver, and the plates just sat there unremoved, while wait staff walked by several times and ignored how I was struggling.  This is not a hallmark of good service.\n\nNow for the fun part - the check.  It was not 2 for 1.  It was 2 for 1 only \"if we had ordered the same dish.\"  Did it say that on the big sign outside?  Nay!  The bill was reduced by $20, not the amount it should have been.  Did it say \"$20 max\" on the big sign outside?  Again, nay.  And when we asked to see the manager, she, or someone claiming to be the manager, sat down and began a double-talk routine that would rival Abbott and Costello, telling us multiple times what I've just written above, repeating over and over that they weren't her's, but the owner's rules.  The biggest zinger, though, was when she said that the 2 for 1 was only for locals.  WTF?  Can you imagine being tourists on a budget schlepping by cab from the Strip because they heard about their Tuesday policy and finding out only at the end that they were SOL?  And did it say it on that big sign?  Third NAY.  Why would a tourist think this 2 for 1 didn't apply to them?  This has to be a blatant lie, and we don't like being lied to.  Obviously, the $4 difference in our check is small and will neither make nor break us.  But this kind of crap is not the way to run a business and alienate customers.  Is the food good?  Yeah.  But there are enough good Italian restaurants in this town with great atmosphere to ever have to put up with this."

We have loved the food and experience but this past week we took a group of work associates to the restaurant and our feelings have totally changed.  We established a group menu and price per person prior to going to the facility.  When it was time to get the bill I was presented a check with a mysterious room charge I was never told about, a price that was $5.00 more per person and a total head count that was 6 more people then were dining (our head count was exactly what we reserved).  I pointed the errors out to our server and she told me the manager who arranged the menu was out of town and she, as the server, could not make any changes to it.  I informed the server I refused to pay the ridiculous over charges.  We spent about a half hour going back and forth (while our paid limo was waiting outside).  I had to go out to the limo, get my phone, and sort through deleted emails to show her that the bill was wrong.  Finally she agreed to reduce the charges.  I have no problem with a manager going on vacation but at least have someone present who can make a decision to correct a wrong!  We will NEVER be going back her again!"

With the sandwiches, which were all about $10, one side is offered from only two selections....pasta salad or fries.  No choices of substitution are allowed; someone in our group with dietary restrictions asked if she could substitute anything else....broccoli, a side salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw.  No substitutions are available.  She was told she could just not get the side if she wanted.  Same price.  The pasta salad was awful, as were the fries.  The fries come with some kind of weird sauce on them.....a mayonnaise based sauce that wrecked the fries.  One person ordered the fries without the sauce.  They were average at best. I feel this restaurant should expand the selection of the two sides that no one in our group of 5 liked at all. The house salad was basically lettuce that was not good.  There were a few microscopic pieces of tomato...not bigger than 1/2 of a square centimeter.  With so many choices in Las Vegas, Capo's needs to serve better side dishes."

Definitely recommend the meatballs and chicken Parmesan, as well as the cannolis yum! \n\nWhen we were first seated we did have to wait almost 20 minutes to be served and even receive water. This was frustrating and the main reason I only gave the restaurant 4 stars. Once our waiter was able to come by the rest of the service was good- he checked on us regularly and was able to provide us with great recommendations as well as make us feel welcomed. \n\nThe added touch of the Sinatra singing is a plus.

All the house wine, beer and well drinks are half price along with appetizers. I think that is from 4pm to 7pm., not 100% sure about times.  We had drinks at the bar and shared an order of Calamari...(It was huge and so.o.o.o good. ) The dipping sauce was fabulous.   Since everyone said the portions were huge, we decided to split an entree and a desert.  We told our server our intentions and there wasn't an extra plate charge or any problem with sharing.  They even divided the entree into to separate servings which we still couldn't eat all of it....By the way, we had ordered spaghetti with the meat sauce.  The meat sauce was a mixture of Italian Sausage and ground beef...It was excellent...I wish we had this place in Atlanta.  For desert we ordered the Chocolate Molten cake with vanilla icecream  It was so yummy.. My husband is Italian so he loved the Godfather movies playing on the bar t.v. and he loved the singer coming around singing Frank Sinatra songs.

The singer has a great voice but the music is fairly loud and makes it difficult to carry on a conversation. It's dark and I understand that goes to the allure of the speakeasy theme but the lights on the menu are so bright that it really blinds you and makes it hard to read anything on the menu. The magician that came to the table put on a nice show but being that I was on a first date and he was a little sexual with my date made her feel uneasy and I think ruined the mood setting which wasn't very fun but he did do some cool illusions I will give him that. The food was great I really have no complaints in that regard I had the chicken anastasia which I would recommend to anyone that visits. I loved how They played off the mob theme at the door with the password and peephole and again the singer was great but just much to loud for a romantic setting the ambiance is nice and the decor is very fitting.

The ambiance and our service impeccable, the best in Vegas we've had (I told her too!) but went against my better judgement on the lasagna that was brought to my table. I cook and cook well enough to know the piece that was brought was old. The cheese on top was encrusted and charred so hard it was impossble it was a new piece. The sausage inside had a slime texture. I had two bites and left it to take home. For two days I have been sick with the worst stomach cramps and vomiting. Folks are visiting in October and made reservations long ago but unfortunately do not feel comfortable bringing them. Capo's, I hope quality control does not become an issue for others and I am saddened to give you such a low rating but still very upset I had to pay to be made ill on a very special night."

When you enter the place, you don't enter from the front, but instead from a small, Semi-unmarked door in the back of the building!  Fkn awesome...LOL.  Once through the door, you're in a small entry space and need to ring a doorbell and talk through a speaker to gain access to the restaurant...even more awesome! :)\n\nOnce in, the place is dark with red diamond tufted banquets.  It feels like in any booth you might see people from the likes of Al Capone to Ol' Blue eyes, Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin.  All the servers are dressed in tuxedos and are extremely attentive from the moment you walk in.  \n\nOnce seated, we were happy they had Hendricks gin and each got a Hendricks and tonic.  Mark H knew that they have large portions so we passed apps and just ordered entrees.  They have some fun sounding dishes with things like Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and Vinnie's alla vodka. :)  I opted for Da Don's Lasagna and Mark H ordered a special, the Clams in red sauce with linguini.  Both dishes were healthy portions and tasty.  Shamefully I actually finished my monstrous piece of lasagna and was stuffed.  Mark H said his pasta dish was good finished it but did have quite a bit of red sauce left.  That's when I realized we didn't get any bread which should have come with our meal.  No biggie since we were already stuffed and didn't want anything else to eat.  \n\nWe obviously passed on dessert.\n\nA pretty cool place to eat at in a town FULL of good restaurants."

We made reservations (which I highly recommend) for 7 p.m. on a Friday night.  We got there a 1/2 hour early not knowing how long the drive would take and am I glad we made reservations - the place was packed this night!  No biggie - we sat at the bar and waited.  We hit it just right because happy hour was from 5-7 p.m. and I had the best martini of my life for half off!  The Domitini (martini) was amazing and my husband said the gin and tonic was great too.  We also ordered the stuffed mushrooms at the happy hour rate and we were really pleased.  The host waited for us to finish our drinks and appetizer before coming over to seat us.  It was nice not to be rushed through or have to juggle drinks and a plate all the way to our table.  And it's not like they weren't busy and could have pushed us along, but the whole focus at Capo's was about customer service.  Probably the best service I've had in my life.\n\nWhen we got to our table, we were immediately given fresh bread and butter and glasses of water.  The bread was so delicious it was hard not to fill up on just that.  The waiter was really pleasant and equally attentive.  We never had empty glasses and services never lagged.  My husband got the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and I got the Chef Sleeps with the Fishes.  The Arrabiata was pretty spicy, so if you like spicy make sure to tell them only medium spicy otherwise you may not enjoy it as much.  My dinner was excellent. The flavors were really amazing; the play between the sun-dried tomatoes and cream and prosciutto was pretty amazing. what made this so good was that you could tell the pasta was homemade and fresh.  It really added to the dish.  To finish we got the chocolate covered cannolis, which we delicious.  They were on par with connolis I got in Boston in Little Italy.  Freshly-made just like everything else they serve, it was the perfect ending at a great restaurant.  When we left, I told the host that the reviews didn't do the place justice and he was genuinely pleased.  I look forward to coming back to capo's on our next Vegas trip."

How can one not be when you hear about their mysterious greeting?\n\nThe BF (now the Big F) and I walked in without reservations on a Sunday evening.  For our party of two, we got to sit on stage.  For future reference, there are very cool romantic booths also available.\n\nWe went straight for their \"Made-Man Pastas.\"  The Big F chose \"Capo's Lasagna\" for $18.50.  It's \"lasagna pasta layered with Italian sausage, crushed meatballs, ricotta cheese and fresh herbs topped with Capo's special sugo and cheeses.\"  He also added a Homemade Italian Meatball for $6.  (Although it does say 'meatballs' on the menu, it's really one big meatball.)\n\nI chose the \"Tortellini Trafficante\" for $18.50, \"pasta rings stuffed with cheese served with proscuitto, peas and mushrooms in our creamy alfredo sauce.\"  I also paid $4 for the added Italian Sausage.\n\nBoth dinners are served with bread, butter, and a choice of Pasta Faggioli, Tony's Duck Soup, or their House Salad.  We both chose \"Tony's Duck Soup\" because the name sounded crazy enough.  They describe it as \"Italian egg drop soup with garlic, spinach, and a touch of crushed red pepper.\"\n\nThe soup was simple, but a bit too salty for my tastes.  Although the Big F enjoyed his lasagna, he thought it could be better.  He did finish it all up though.  My tortellini dish was good with its creamy sauce, but definitely very heavy.  (I had leftovers.)  The added Italian sausage wasn't particularly a favorite of mine either, perhaps my tastes aren't refined enough.\n\nAs a result, we never made it to dessert.  With names like \"Ma Barker's Cobbler,\" \"Leo's Lips Lava Cake,\" and \"Dillinger's Chocolate Covered Cannoli's,\" you're saddened you missed out. \n\nFor the ambiance, I'll give it a solid five stars.  The restaurant really does make you feel like you're part of this secret society.  It would be great for groups or a dinner for two.  \n\nIn terms of food, I'd give it a 3.  \n\nOverall, a four star rating.\n\n(Pics of our dinner are posted!)\n\nApparently they also have a happy hour from 5 to 7 pm!"

I don't even know how relevant it is in the evening, though maybe the entertainment may be better than the food.  I went to lunch there recently with a group of friends.  The food was not very good.  Their bread is horrible!  It is dry and tasteless. Come on guys, with all the restaurants in Las Vegas who serve good bread, you can do better!  Several of us got food which was not very warm.  One person got a burnt (really burnt) meatball.  The tomato sauce was sickeningly sweet, as though it had a ton of sugar in it. I was most disappointed with my dish, Pasta Primavera. You would think it would be a medley of veggies, i.e. brocolli, squash, carrots, etc. \nNope! It was as if they took the pasta and threw in some of their bell pepper strips (tiny) from their sausage and peppers, and added tons of red onion. That was it and this meager amount of vegetable was swimming in oil.  \nThe atmosphere was depressing with no windows and big chandeliers and dark walls.  If you are a tourist and want the \"speakeasy\" feeling of the mobs, go to The Plaza hotel downtown and go to Oscar's.  They have a cute backroom with much better atmosphere and much, much better food. In all fairness, the waiter we had was such a nice young man and kept trying to appease our group, and so I say \"don't shoot the messenger\", it wasn't his fault the manager can't get a good Italian chef or find a decent bread bakery.  I give Capo's a big, fat \"D\"!"

If your looking for a popular dish to pick unfortunately your in for a long meal because there are several popular dishes even some that are not on the menu!! Tip is have an idea of what your hungry for and tell the staff so they can best guide you. \nThe Sugo is as good as I have ever had in the resturant setting. They spend the time to crank out an original old world Italian family recipe sauce. \nWe shared the meatball and peppers app. The appetizer comes with 2 huge perfectly flavored meatballs and some green peppers in the Sugo.  Be sure and have extra bread here that sauce is amazing. The big doms Primavera was delicious too and huge portion on the lunch menu.

Most good restaurants use a pivot position so when the food is delivered they know which guest gets which item without calling them out.  When they served the plates to us they just stood in one position and served the plates over the other guests.  This isn't even done at Low end places like Cheesecake Factory.  We all had to ask several times for water and iced tea refills while the servers/bussers were all standing around.  Everyone was nice but need more server training.

They add on tips and the service sucks.. They don't allow splitting the checks. The power went out our server never came to check on us once during the outage, if it wasn't for the bus boy we never would have gotten our drinks refilled, and it took 2.5 hours to get our food.. we attempted to make reservations earlier that day but they don't open til 5pm we called at 450pm and we're able to make a reservation were told that they would waived the room fee, when we got there they hunted me down to question me about the fee. I wouldn't have minded paying the fee but there was no air conditioning and it was a little side room that was hot and stuffy and there was no view to enjoy the entertainment,  not what one expects to pay additional for. Our bill was over 400.00 and an additional tip of 85 was placed on the bill for a party of 10 adults and 4 children. After the 2.5 hour wait for dinner we couldn't wait to get out of there and I was to hot and exhausted from complaining about the stupid room fee to stay and complain about the awful service. I felt ripped of with the quailty and quanity of the food vs. The price. I thank them for at least taking the room fee off as it is not worth it and they had told me that they would waive the fee in the first place anyways.

We won't be back, there is to many other places in Las Vegas that consistantly serve better food with better service then this place that will appreciate our business.."

Getting in was a trip . . . but I will not spoil that here . . . that is for you to find out.\n\nSince we did not have reservations and were really pretting hungry . . . we opted for eating at the bar near the kitchen . . . this was like eating at a chef's table in some high dollar restaurant only fun.

Great choice, they we unbelievable . . . then a house salad . . . perfect with just the right amount of itialian dressing . . . and a main course of the lasagna with an extra meatball . . . even though I was starving coming in . . . it was too much for me, but was so tasty that I coulldn't stop.\n\nOur server asked us if we would like desert . . . I always like to look . . . and even tough stuffed . . .

It came with so many sides that I literally got scared if I could finish it. \n\nWe started off with the meatballs and fried ravioli, and I can honestly say I would eat that all day long.  I didn't need anything else.  Then out came the salad with the garlic dressing and I was in heaven. \n\nThe steak and lobster meal was great but in most cases you cant really F that up, most of the time.  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, garlic mash, and the risotto.  I will say the highlight of the meal was the side of risotto.  I was absolutely stuffed by the time I got to the side of risotto and I couldn't stop once I had a taste of it.  \n\nThe only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I had to ask for water 5 times.  Not 5 different occasions, but 5 times until my glass was actually filled.  It may seem petty but with as many amazing flavors as Capo's has going on water was needed throughout the whole meal.  Also with the preset there was a glass of wine or champagne that was never brought to our table.  \n\nI will come back again regardless, the food and atmosphere was great!"

We did not know where the door was. Long story short I got scared but the environment was great! Old fashion Italian style restaurant I'm assuming with all the dim lights and wonderful Frank Sinatra type music playing. THEY EVEN HAD A LIVE SINGER SINGING!! That's a plus. \n     The servers and managers were phenomenal!! **If you expect to be in a restaurant where everything is perfect, please don't come here. The employees and managers do talk and hang around and watch tv..going back to the \"more old fashion Italian\" style? But nonetheless I LOVEDDD it there. The food was great, everyone had a sense of humor. We left the restaurant laughing which was a great way to end our night."

So, I'm excited to go there, and we get there, and we had to wait for 5 minutes after ringing the bell, and snuck in after someone happened to go through the door, to be \"greeted\" by the rudest, scowl faced man stating \"you need a reservation.\" With seats clearly open behind him, and I said \"we have a groupon now...\" to him saying \"Meh. A groupon. Heh. Whatever.\" After 10 min we're seated, with him saying to the waitress \"they have a groupon\" quite snobbilyy. then it took 30 minutes for us to even receive WATER. Then we are told you have to spend $60 to even use the groupon after the groupons been redeemed so you have no choice, then we're told we can't even use 2 groupons or split checks. So it takes forever to even order, and forever to even receive the food. Then, the bread does go stale after 2 minutes and the butter they bring you is very little, and after asking for extra, we don't get any extra. The soup was cold. And the food was very bland, and it hurts yur stomach. The waitress was extremely rude, and the bouncer stands over the entire dinner watching you to make sure you don't share bc then they charge $6. So, I'm sitting through this entire dinner highly tense and not enjoying my dinner at all, I feel like I was about to cry or eve throw up. After asking for the check, the girl unauthorizingly took $16 for a tip for hrself. And for a groupon that was only supposed to be $25 for $50 ended up costing me about $80. And that's not with me ordering extra,, that's with all the outrageous fees they charge. The staff was RUDE. And it was literaly the most unenjoyable experience I have ever had. I have never written a review in my life, but I just HAD to for this terrible hell-hole."

If you wanted some atmosphere before you entered, you got it. I thought I had stumbled upon a real mob joint.\n\nThe inside is much bigger than I had imagined. You get that Italian feel for the place with the distinct booth seating and the waiter's outfits. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the service in these huge restaurants can be hit or miss. It feels that there are just a few too many servers when we went. We had people sit after us get their orders taken before us. We were seated but it took a few awkward minutes of waiting to get our drinks ordered. The servers themselves were very attentive and sweet. Just a logistics issue.\n\nAs everyone knows, when you come to an Italian restaurant for lunch, the must order item is the hamburger. That wasn't a thing before? Well it might be after you eat their House Specialty, Joey's Burger. What's so special about it? Does it have bacon jam made from special Gyspys who are only found in the Western Alps? I doubt it. It's just a great burger. Meat has that charcoal grill flavor to it. The bun was sturdy and delicious. Sometimes, just eating a good burger than doesn't fall apart is what it's about.\n\nSo what's da matta with you?! Go get a burger there already!"

You ring the bell outside the entrance and a guy slides open a tiny window and asks what you want/what you're doing there, sort of like Robert De Niro's 'whads da matter with ya?' voice.\n\nWe didn't have reservations, which you probably should do if you want a table. It was no prob, we got seated at the bar and were fine with that.\n\nIt's really dark in here, so much so that the menu includes a little light on it so you can read it.  Good thing I checked out the menu online before so I kinda had a clue!\n\nA bartender was our server, she was really nice and pleasant and checked on us frequently.  I'd tell you she was really attractive too, but again it was too dark to tell, so maybe it was just a guy that had extremely large pectoral muscles. Oh, she (or he?) was really good at making recommendations and answering questions about the menu too.\n\nWhat we had: bruschetta, calamari, meatballs, and my main course was Vinnie's Alla Vodka.  The latter comes in at a bit under $20 and is what I'd totally recommend. The meatball appetizer also seems to be one of their signature items and is probably something you should give a try.\n\nI know we had a few other things, but this is what I can remember.

We checked out the website and were really intrigued, it looked fun! Then to top it off, we found a 'Groupon Now' deal that was $25 for $50, so we gave it a shot.\n\nWhen we got there the entrance was confusing, we thought we were in the wrong place. But we were delighted when we were greeted through the little hidden window and welcomed in. Instantly we knew this would be a place we'd return to. The decor is so romantic, velvet wallpaper, red leather booths, and chandeliers hanging above each table. They had live music by a piano player and later there was a lounge style act while we ate. It really was entertaining rather than distracting, and the music was mostly love songs. Being that it was our anniversary we even got up and danced - I didn't expect this at dinner!\n\nThe menu looked good but we ended up ordering both specials for the evening: Filet mignon and halibut with risotto.. They were fantastic! We couldn't believe the food was so good! The wine list was a little pricey, but not totally unreasonable.\n\nThe biggest surprise was the service. Our waitress was very attentive, offered suggestions, gave us tastings of the wines we were debating about and was not at all put off when she found out we had a Groupon.\n\nA man came around selling roses, which I think could be annoying if you're not with a date, but for us it was an added feature for an anniversary meal.\n\nWe will be coming back soon, esp. because they regularly offer their Groupon. I'd highly recommend trying this place but go on a night that you're up for the entertainment."

We were seated by the exit marked \"stage door\" because we had a handicapped person in a wheelchair and were told that it would be easy access for us to exit when we were leaving. We ordered appetizers, wine and salads before dinner. It was 6:30 before we were served the above. We ordered our dinner and proceeded to eat the appetizers and salad.  Dinner was served at approximately 7:02.  We ate dinner and then ordered dessert and coffee.  That was served at 7:20.  At 7:30 a second dessert was ordered and at 7:42 we were asked to leave by a very rude female employee, who said  \"our table was needed for a large party that they were trying to accommodate. Our check was in the range of $250 that included appetizers, dinner, 2 bottles of wine and dessert and coffee.  We were there for 2 hours and 12 minutes!!!  How disheartening to see that our business as locals, senior citizens and handicapped was not appreciated.  I guess the size of our check was not big enough to allow us to finish our coffee.  I also told him that the peppers and sausage was horrible and greasy.\n\nI complained and Dominick Santucci responded he was sorry stating that they do not like to rush patrons, but that we were there for almost three hours.  He was very defensive stating that other party had been waiting for an hour (I guess we should have left at 6:30 and took our dinner to go) then they would have had no wait.  He also said the peppers and sausage were one of the chefs best dishes.  (Maybe they are, but not on this night......they were horrible). And...........he offered a $25.00 gift card. \n\n In response, I let him know exactly how long we were there, where we were seated and that we could not rush a handicapped person trying  to eat.  His response was not to respond. SO LOCALS AND TOURISTS.................IF YOU WANT TO BE TREATED WITH SOME DISRESPECT, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO.  ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR CASH!!!!!!!!!!"

I ordered what was to be a prime ribeye which was over cooked and flat!!!! No flavor at all and my husband had pasta with meatballs and sausage. Typical Italian food. It was so dry and the meatball I can't even describe, just awful. I think it was to much breading?? The dessert was good. Espresso cold. Oh well, we still enjoyed ourselves, but will not return."

The setting and ambiance are perfect.\n\nAs for the meal, \n\nThe wine list is a very lacking, as it was mostly new world wines with only fifteen or so selections.  We settled on a bottle of Ruffino Gold Label ($60), all though if they had any quality Italian wines we would have been happy to spend a bit more.  On the high end side of things they only had Silver Oak and Opus One, which were priced far below normal Vegas mark-ups ($110 & $250).\n\nI got there a bit after my friends who had already ordered appetizers.  When the apps came, they brought out the bruschetta with no cheese instead of no pancetta as my friends had claimed to order it.  My friends can be space cadets so this could have been their fault.  Regardless of who's fault it was, the waitress was very nice and brought a new one and allowed us to keep the improperly made one on the table.\n\nI ordered the Pasta Fagioli soup which was excellent, but served luke warm, and then the Veal Piccata which was also very good, all though I thought it was a bit of a small portion.  Everybody else at the table really enjoyed their meals, and it was a pleasant experience with Dean Martin and Frankie Blue Eyes being sung five feet away from us.\n\nOur server was very nice and attentive even though she had quite a few tables running at once.\n\nI will come back to Capos when I am in the mood for a fun evening away from the strip.  The food is good, but not great.  But considering that it's not that expensive, and they have to keep a guy employed just to scare the crap out of you at the front door, I'll give them a pass.  They get five stars because I did enjoy the evening very much, and I don't want to get whacked next time I come in if I only gave it four."

            "review": "So...it's been almost a month since my most recent visit and my anger is finally starting to subside long enough for me to update my past review for this place.\nI should also note that I have eaten at Capo's (both locations) many times since my first review. It had become a place we take out of town guests, celebrate birthdays, and basically go for our \"favorites\" on \"just because nights\". I have also recommended this restaurant to everyone I encounter that is looking for a great experience and great meal. Well, that is now in the past.\n\nWhen Valentines Day started to approach this year Capos was the front runner for our night out. We made reservations two weeks in advance and then about a week before we called to add another couple to our guest count. We were all so excited and looking forward to it!! Both people on the phone were very nice and we added to our reservation with ease. We always order the same things when we go and we were looking forward to sharing the evening with good friends.\n\nWhen we arrived we were quickly led to our table. As we settled into our table we realized that a paper menu had been placed in front of us as opposed to the regular one. When the back server came to the table first to fill our water glasses we told him that we were not given menus. He began to tell us that the regular menu was not available that evening and the paper menu was the one that was. I quickly glanced at the menu noticing that our favorite dishes were no where to be found. It was clear that this was a special \"set menu\" with of course, inflated prices. When the server approached our table we asked politely if we could speak to a manager. Several minutes later a woman approached our table, presumably the manager. I began to explain that we had come to enjoy their wonderful regular menu and were disappointed that in the two phone conversations I had making the reservations NO ONE had told us that a limited menu would be served that night.\n\nOk...breathe....\n\nThe woman responded not with an apology or an offer of a solution, but rather, with insult to myself and my guests. She said that \"we\" should have just expected that because of the holiday there would be a set menu. She continued to explain that they had called many other restaurants in the area and that \"80% of them were offering the same thing\". To add further insult, she then pointed around the room at the other tables and said, \"no one else seems to have a problem with it\". That was it. That was the moment when Capo's went from my favorite restaurant in the city to one I will never eat at again. My party and I got up and left of course and ended up at another great family owned, Italian restaurant in town where we enjoyed a wonderful four course meal with great wine, fantastic homemade food, and great friends.\n\nI have been in the food and beverage industry for 13 years and I was completely shocked by how a manager could treat guests. Also, if you are going to have a \"set menu\" on a particular night, then fine, but inform your guests. To be quite honest, had we been told during the reservation process of the limited menu would would have just made a reservation for the following night (we were all off from work the next night too and the chance to order all of the stuff we come back for would have been worth waiting a day)"

I grew up with this kind of food in New Jersey and my Scottish husband has really taken a liking to it. \n\nBeen here for both lunch and dinner. \n\nLunch offers a more limited menu including some specials. The chicken parm (sandwich or entree) is one of the best I've ever had. The sandwich has perfectly breaded chicken, with good gooey cheese on quality bread, and the entree portion of the chicken parm is enormous and so delicious. I don't even like spaghetti and meatballs usually but the spaghetti here with one giant, perfect meatball in amazing red sauce is my exception for that. \n\nIf you can save room for dessert, have the cheesecake or cannoli. \n\nNice wines and cocktails, service is really friendly and good overall. \n\nInterior is awesome with booths scattered throughout, dark and great ambiance (as long as you ignore that half the pictures on the walls are of gangsters and other violent mass killers).\n\nItalians who are actually from Italy probably wouldn't consider this \"real\" Italian food. But it's Italian-American comfort food at its best, and they do it really, really well."

So much so, we decided to invite my family to capos for dinner the other day, thinking it would be a pleasant change from the olive garden. \n\nBoy, were we wrong.\n \nFirst off, the restaurant was DARK. I remember it being dimly lit the last time we had dinner there, but not like that.  I couldn't even see the faces of the people surrounding me, much less my food.  Im not one to complain too much about the ambiance, but I know something is wrong when I walk out of there with tired, strained eyes.  Plus, I think there was an alterior motive for this dark lighting, aside from an energy savings technique (more on this later).  \n  \nThe service was crappy, or should i say our waitress was. She didn't know most of the plates offered on the menu, and she was spastic and disconnected.  We all asked for water with no ice, but they gave us the opposite. And we asked for a couple of extra things, like olive oil for bread, but they never made it to our table. \n\nThe food was... so-so. Some dishes were overly spiced.  Parents shrimp scampi had 6 shrimps each, tops.  Lasagna was okay.  Overall it was decent, but the first time we went there, the food was way better.  Or maybe it seemed that way because we had a better experience.  Or maybe seeing your food is part of the experience of enjoying it, and if you can't see it, you can't enjoy it.  \n\nLastly, but most importantly, we are certain that they *OVERCHARGED* us. The bill came close to 300 (not including the tip we gave), and altho we thought it was too much, we didn't fight it because we were with my parents (don't wanna look bad) and we couldn't even read the bill. (again, the lighting issue... maybe that's why they keep it so dark in there.)  After tallying up the score at home, we realize that they most likely charged us an 18 to 20 percent gratuity (for a group of 6? Really?) and didn't tell us. (Lucky them, they got two tips).  But that still doesn't account for the total amount that they charged us, so we think that they probably charged us an extra plate as well.  We will never know, because we never saw the receipt properly at the restaurant (try reading a note hand written in pencil in the darkest corner you can manage, and that was our situation) and they didn't give us a receipt to take home.\n \nSo in short, poor lighting, bad service, and ridiculous pricing/charging methods will keep us away.  The food definitely isn't worth it."

My rating isn't based on the food it is based on the distinct feeling small children aren't \"very\" welcome. Firstly while many people find the \"faux mob\" motif part of the ambience I found it quirky. From having a small window opened to the \"mob whisper\" host. This is their \"thing\" and judging from reviews it is well received so this is MY problem not theirs. My issue was actually that we went late afternoon/early evening with our 3 year old and 7 month old. We were sat by a side door-which was opened a couple of times letting broad daylight into an otherwise very dark restaurant. We definitely were sat \"out of the way\" of everyone-that is the feeling I got. Our server was decent-not great, service was decent. What my rating is really down to is they clearly wanted us out before the \"dinner crowd\" really started and it was painfully obvious. I was a waitress in college so I know about rushing people out/turning the \"four top\" etc and this was definitely the feeling I got. I think an all adult party who liked the \"faux mob\" motif would be received better and quite like this restaurant."

The restaurant opened for lunch at 11:00a but we got there a little early and couldn't really tell where the entrance was. We parked and looked like the place was boarded up... turns out the front entrance was not so obvious. In fact, we entered in this wooden door to find another closed door that was a waiting room (no seats). We had to ring the doorbell and wait until someone opened a little peep window to let us in. This little waiting place had photos of wanted mafia members and dons. We were let inside the restaurant by a host who looked like he portrayed an associate dressed as a gangster, suspenders and all, and led us past the bar to the back section of the restaurant. \n\nThe quiet, casual elegant setting had a mob theme with the red leather seats, the glass chandeliers, the black wallpapered walls, and more photos of mafia dons and gangsters hung on the walls. It was like a scene from The Godfather, the movie. It is dark inside. The wait staff catered to our needs as we were served green salad w/ garlic dressing, bread/butter and our orders. I had the \"Capones Carbonara\" (pancetta, tomatoes, peas, red onions, shallots & fettuccini tossed in garlic egg cream sauce). Eccelente! Mangia!!! Hubby had the  \"Vinnie's Chicken Parmesan Melt\" (chicken breast, breaded, fried, topped with mozzarella cheese and their secret sauce). If reading that description didn't make your mouth water, well, there are lots more from their menu to choose from and cleverly named with mafia themes. Our food and the atmosphere was great!\n\nThe restaurant looked like it can accommodate large groups and banquets as well as intimate dinners for two . There is a private room and it had a booth that can seat two, it also had a screen like you can watch a movie or something. This room had a door and it is in between the bar and the restroom away from the rest of the dining area. \n\nLocated less than 15 minutes from the Strip this made our dining experience unforgettable! Thought that we would get a visit from the don himself... after all, Las Vegas had a history of mafia crime lords.\n\nReview #459"

You'll understand what that means once you actually go here, and you need to go here!\n\nI loved the mobster throwback feel once inside.  From the pictures and some mug shots of gangsters on the wall to the low-dimmed lighting, it really set the mood of feeling like I was in a restaurant from years past.  Our group of 6 were quickly seated and attended to, and I said service was very good. \n\nNow for the food--all very good!  We went with their lunch specials, and for the most part everyone in the party ordered either the meatball sub or the Italian beef.  I had the meatball sub, and boy are they some good tasting (and good sized) meatballs.  However, the Italian beef was EXCELLENT.  I would definitely get this next time.  Great flavor, great texture, the bread was delicious (as was the hoagie the meatball sub came on).  \n\nSandwiches came with a choice of side: either french fries or a pasta salad.  My parents had been to this restaurant before and said neither side was that great.  Their complaint was the french fries came with some sauce of some kind already on them, and they were not a fan.  The waitress said they could do the sauce on the side, which I went with--I have no idea what this sauce was, but it was delicious!  So delicious that I definitely could have been looking the little bowl it came in clean with my finger.  I'm very excited to go back and try it again with the sauce actually on the fries.  Morale of the story: Don't listen to my parents (That's why they aren't Yelp Elite!). \n\nDefinitely try this restaurant.  All employees were very friendly, prices were super reasonable, and it was just a fun overall experience."

She was so startled by the \"greeter,\" and he felt terrible that my sister had such a strong reaction. My sister got a kick out of it though after she said her heart stopped racing. \n\nI was really hoping to be serenaded as some previous reviewers mentioned, but no tableside singing on a Tuesday night (maybe?). Oh well, it was still great! Our waiter had a fake Italian accent. The Godfather II was playing on the TV. Crime scene tape was on the floor.

They also had a roaming magician working off of tips. I hate to say it but he was incredible lol. Thought he was going to be annoying but I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I would have changed would be the chairs in the banquet room. Way to low and not very comfortable. The food? Off the charts good. I had the Chicken Anastasia and grilled veggies. SO on point. Everyone is se enjoyed their dishes as well to the point that everyone was talking about it the next day. I brought my wife here a couple of nights later and it was just as amazing.

(Saturday night reservation for 9pm)\n\n 1st the hostess.. he was rude.. we had a reservation for 4 people.. when you come in you have to knock on the door.. while my husband boss was still talking to him (hostess) thru the little window.. he closed it on him. Oookay and when he finally opened the door.. we followed him to the back of the restaurant.. instead of him walking us to the table..  he pointed to where our seats were and he walked back to the front.. \nNow the place was beautiful and the entertainment was greeeaattt.. I think we sat there for a while waiting on a server to pick our table up. We didnt even have a server assigned to us..  anyway we received our drinks super late.. I was served a dirty glass of coke.. I told the busser politely excuse me, my glass is dirty can i have another coke.. he said no problem took the glass to the bar sat it down.. i dont know if he realized it.. but.. he brung me back the same coke i told him to take away.. now i use to be a dishwasher for 4 years so I pay attention to things like this. So i just didnt touch my drink.. we ordered appetizers garlic bread with cheese and calamari.. our party was passing the the food around and when it got to me i was disappointed because where you grip the plate there was dirty food stuck to the bottom of the bowl brim so you can feel it.. our plates werent washed properly.. I was grossed OUT ready to leave.. we couldnt find our server.. she disappeared some where so we were just sitting there..  my asparagus soup was old.. it had a film on top from sitting so long and the middle was cold . You could tell our food sat in the window for a long time. My shrimp was stale (dried out) We ended up being the last party on the floor.. they were closing we had to ask a busser for our check because no one knew where our server was.  Then we see her walking thru the back door like everything was okay.  And this was by far the worst service we've had in a long time.. \nYou need to FIRE THE HOSTESS AND THE SERVER AND RETRAIN THE BUSSER.  P.s my husband got sick"

The back of their menu even says to state any complaint before you leave and asks you not to be a \"Jimmy The Weasel\". Red flag much?\n\nFor starters the food was nothing spectacular and extremely overpriced. I had the \"Sawed Off\" sausage and peppers which was $22! C'mon now. The dish was nearly all pasta and peppers with very little sausage. My dad had the extremely small portioned \"Gotti\" chicken. My wife had the fettuccine alfredo and actually left the restaurant saying she was still hungry. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay...not spectacular, but okay.\n\nNow I'm not one to complain about a restaurant especially when the food is okay. My family and I enjoy trying new places and you're not always going to have a great experience. However, Capo's had me ready to refuse paying the bill. We used a $25 for $50 Groupon last night and Capo's works the system to where the Groupon is useless. We had 4 adults and my 4 year old son (who shared a plate). With the Groupon applied our bill was $77.77 ($127.77 without). However, the waitress took it upon herself to add $25.55 for gratuity putting the bill back up to $103.32. With the price of my Groupon, the bill was actually $0.55 higher than it would have been without a tip and to be honest, the service we received didn't deserve anywhere near a $25 tip. Once they took the credit card, the waitress even went as far as writing the tip amount on the credit card slip herself!!! Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's illegal...\n\nNow I realize many Groupon's have fine print stating there will be an added gratuity or something but not in Capo's Groupon. Be warned, this place has other reviews about the business scamming customers and now I see why. They make the Groupon useless by adding their own tip at their chosen amount. I will never return to this place and will contact Groupon in attempt to have these theives removed from their site. Now I just have to hope they didn't steal my credit card info!"

This is the ONLY restaurant in Vegas where you will find the most delicious Italian specialties, like eating at Gramma's, for a very affordable price. Their meatballs rival Rao's and come out on top without a doubt. The macaroni dishes are overflowing and are topped with the most delicious specialty gravies.   Not to mention, the very refreshing, old world speak-easy charm, very efficient staff (with pleasant personalities), and the entertainment truly is a time machine back to the Sinatra days that make this whole dining experience a worthwhile destination to say the least.  So put this one on the top five list, and enjoy a unique dining experience. Bobby Liguori, the Frank Sinatra - of the night, should not be missed!  His performance is Sinatra - close your eyes and let his voice  take you back.  He is a Brooklyn boy as well!!  He performs on the weekends only and he definitely the frosting on top of this mouthwatering cake! Try Capo's - YOU WILL NOT REGRET THE TRIP!"

            "review": "Ok, I read all of your blogs and comments before taking on this experience. Overall I have seen mixed reviews about this restaurant ranging from as high as 4 stars to as low as 1 star. My wife and I went here on Monday 25 Apr 2011 as a pre-celebration to my 42nd birthday. We had a 6:00 pm reservation and valet parked at the location. The reservation was honored and my vehicle was parked right in the front of establishment.\n\nWe have lived within Las Vegas since 2003 and have roots to the Midwest. I am from Chicago (truly a city kid, Southside, and White Sox fan) and my wife is from St. Louis. Service was fantastic, the hostess was very prompt with our meals, checked just enough to see if we required any additional service however, allowed us to hold a conversation with each other. Ziggy was the manager that night and ran a classy shift. Service is a 9.5 out 10 because there is always room for improvement. We were allowed to choose our seat and the crowd was about moderate size. Bummer that night no live piano, that would have made for a perfect night. Instead we had to listen to various big band, R&B, and top 40 dinner music.\n\nI had the meatballs with spaghetti for dinner and my wife had the steak, she likes her steak overcooked. The meatballs were ok, not the best that I have ever had coming from a Black, Irish, Italian, and Germany neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago however, merited a 7 out 10. The sauce with the meatballs was the bomb, 9 out 10. I make my sauce from scratch and my wife and I almost did not get together because the first time that she cooked spaghetti with red sauce she tried using that crap in the jar and I asked her if she was making spaghetti for the dog. Lol now, but was not funny then. The steak was ok, I like my steak with pink inside so to me the steak lacked flavor, but as I said in the beginning my wife likes her steak overcooked. For desert we shared a generous serving of the tiramisu on the patio, I would go back just for the tiramisu. This was better than any tiramisu that I have had in Chicago or New York, I went to college within Saratoga Springs and Albany with many weekend trips to New York City. Overall, the food is a 6.5 out 10.\n\nThe lighting in the restaurant is dark, which I enjoyed very much. After 10 minutes or so your night vision will set in and you can easily see your meal and the person sitting across from you. Until then use the mini flash lights or the light from you cell phone. The dim light avoids rubber necking at the patrons around you and eyeballing their man, girl, and food. You have to actually look at, talk, and listen to the person that you came to the restaurant with, what a concept. Do not bring a grenade to this affair as you will be hurting. This dime eye candy action. You can barely see the people sitting at the tables around you, all you see are shadows. The true purpose and setting of a speakeasy duh............. This is not some entertainment ride or want to be speakeasy, as my wife said this is the true deal.\n\nI found the place very romantic with a little bit of curiosity and mystery. My wife was very surprised by the door hide at the entrance. This made for a fun evening and met my expectations. Though the price is moderate $100 for two (includes one alcohol drink for each, meals for two, and one shared desert) the location, food, and ambience is not equivalent. However, you are paying to be in a speakeasy (private club) therefore, you should expect a higher price for everything in order to keep out the riff raff. If I had to explain that to you before you understood how a speakeasy works this place is not for you. Stick with olive garden or some other franchise Italian restaurant. \n\nMy wife and I will definitely return to this restaurant with adult friends and look forward to our next trip there. I hope that this helps all and has some street cred for those of you that can read between the lines. This is not the place to bring anyone that is under the age of 15. Even then I believe that company here is best to keep at the age of 21 and older. Oh not sure about the place on Trop but location on Sahara is good to go."

We loved the other location and were hoping that the new location would be just as good or better.   Please note that we are a couple that go out to dinner often, we like all kinds of food and are willing to pay for great service, food and ambiance.\n\nOur journey here began when we went into the private room entrance and we were asked \"how many are in your party.\"    For those of you who frequented the \"other\" location, this was a first of many touches that are now gone from the \"new\" location.   We were then asked if we wanted to sit at our table and wait for our friends.  \n\nWe opted to have a drink at the bar.   The bar is actually opposite the open kitchen which is very HOT and not comfortable at all.   The bartender, who was a very good one, was talking to us about schedule issues for the staff and how she was supposed to be there in the morning and not the evening......etc, etc.    Not exactly a welcoming opener to our dinner.     \n\nOur friends showed up within a few minutes and we were escorted back to a back booth in the restaurant.    I asked if it was a good table and was told it was \"superb\".   Ah, if they only told us that a large party was going to be sitting in front of us!   The noise was so loud I couldn't hear the people next to me talk.   When the singer began his act, the place was way over the top loud.   In the other location, the singer interacted with the people in the restaurant.   This was not the case here.\n\nThe restaurant air-conditioning was almost non-existent and actually become extremely uncomfortable.   No, I wasn't having a hot flash, I was HOT!   Is this a sign of the restaurant not being able to afford their energy bill??\n\nOur waitress was very nonchalant and really not very friendly.    We ordered drinks, and then dinner.   The menu is extensive although no eggplant dishes which was weird for an Italian Restaurant.   The food was just \"okay\".   We have definitely had better and for way less money.    \n\nOne of the ladies in our party had a shrimp dish and the shrimp was almost hard as a rock and way overcooked.   When the Chef came around to ask how things were, our friend said that her shrimp dish was way overcooked.   His response, \"thank you for letting us know\", and moved on.   \n\nWe had a piece of cheese cake for dessert with caramel sauce and it was worse than store bought cheese cake.     The flavor was simply \"okay\".   Not great.\n\nWe did use a Restaurant.com coupon which saved us $30 but the coupon also stipulates that 18% gratuity is added to the check.   I would skip this restaurant and this coupon.    \n\nWith so many choices for GREAT Italian food, I would definitely avoid this restaurant and try some of the GREAT ones here in Vegas."

The mushroom risotto was outstanding! The pasta figioli and Tony Duck's soup were equally fantastic! I highly recommend Capo's!"

Please be advised try to sit as far away from the piano and singer, the speakers and music can get loud and you are unable to hear yourself or your company speak. Other then that i would definately recommend this restaurant to anyone!"

Sign me up!\n\nThere is a little surprise waiting for you when you knock on the door, but I won't ruin any surprises...\n\nThe restaurant is dark with red leather big booths, with dark red velvet walls. They had a Sinatra styled singer performing, and we even had a magician stop by our tables and BLOW OUR MINDS!!  Seriously, one of the trippiest and straight-up scary performances I've ever seen. This dude was the son of satan.\n\nNow on to the food... We started with a few appetizers. Ma's Meatballs, Calamari, and Bust a Cap Mushroom Caps. All were great, but the very spicy meatballs were my favorite. The warm breadsticks served with garlic butter were bomb as well. I ordered the Chicken Parm with Spaghetti con Suga and a creamy garlic salad. The salad was so tasty! The spaghetti fantastic! And the chicken parm so on point, it was perfection! The salad was one of my favorite salads I've ever had, and the chicken parm was possibly my favorite ever.\n\nNow, onto the dessert... The chocolate covered cannoli was the best cannoli I've ever had. This place was a clean sweep! Awesome ambiance, cool theme and schtick, good entertainment, and fantastic food.\n\n5 stars and a must stop for me next time I'm in Sin City. Highest possible recommendation."

I ALWAYS talk over with them if they want to eat a 'famous chef' dinner or an interesting fun and always delicious dinner, my favorite italian place.  \n    \n  When friends want the \"famous chef\" dinner the conversation continues and we choose from many and .... it doesn't always turn out so well, as all of us locals know.   But I always promise to myself the next time will be Capo's!    \n\nTHEN - those who chose Capo's the first time ALWAYS rave rave rave about the experience and the food - ALWAYS!   And I always ask if they think they've made the right decision and they all tell me I should not have given them a choice.  \n\nI have yet to have that happen once with  the \"famous chef\" restaurant experience.  \n\nWait, except for once, mom and dad visited and we had a Wolfgang Puck  Thanksgiving Day meal... mom loved it, but I get the feeling she likes to say Wolfgang Puck too.  Also no 'rave rave rave', just a nod saying this is better than I expected.  ;-)  \n\nDad, the Italian, raved raved raved about Capo's, mom tells her friends \"oh you have to have her take you to this little secret Italian place with the tommy gun right up there on the wall\".  rofl"

We wanted to get off the strip (we went to the original one - not new one on West Sahara) for a change and I was craving hearty Italian food (it was cold outside this trip!)

And for the amount of food you get, the prices are reasonable. Especially after you have been eating on the strip/at hotels for a couple days!\n\nI had the rigatoni in meat sauce with a GIANT meatball. It hit the spot!! Exactly as I was craving.  My husband had the lasagna and said it was very good.  We were stuffed full so didn't get to try dessert but I plan on going back!\n\nI liked it so much that I took my leftovers back to the hotel and carefully transported them back home with me the next day - refused to let such yummy food go to waste! Italian food is my all time favorite but a lot of places are very generic/lacking in flavor - this is definitely not one of them.\n \nPlus we got there about 20 minutes before they closed and they in no way made us feel rushed.  Very nice staff!"

We stood there for a few minutes and then a small window opened behind us.  I was so surprised and caught off guard, I let out a loud yelp.\n\nThe side door opened, which lead us into a dark restaurant.  The place was decorated with old italian mafia type accessories.  Most of the props looked really old and it further reinforced the feeling of being at Disneyland. \n\nWe were seated on the stage area and had a good view of the live singer, who sang Dean Martin hits most of the night and it sounded really good.  \n\nThe restaurant was so dark, the menus had small flashlights attached to them.   We had the egg drop soup, appetizer pizza, scallops and arrabiata pasta.  Everything was very good.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  \n\nI gave it one less star because of the aged mafia props!"

The interior is ok but small. When we sat at our booth I thought it would be nice but that's when things fell apart. My daughter ordered a steak. $23.95! It was over cooked and breaded to much. She sent it back and told them about it. They still had the nerve to charge her $20.00 for a tiny salad and a little pasta. The rest of our party ordered their food and said it was just ok but the prices are way to high. The piano player was way in a corner and he kept singing to the wall instead of the crowd. There were two birthdays at our table and not one did one thing. The waitress was polite but not friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

The outside resembles what looks to be some piece of crap shed however when you enter the world transforms into a 1920's speakeasy. From the time I entered to the bill I knew I was going to enjoy this place. My favorite is their chicken marsala it is to die for. But back to the atmosphere, its great maybe a little bit to dark but I understand why. The host looks like he just finished a hit on someone based on his size which gives it more of that authentic look. Best part is they have a pianist on certain days, which can sing some amazing Sinatra. The food and drinks yes might be a little on the pricy side but defiantly worth every penny. The wait staff is great two I have had the same waitress twice and both times she was great the other 4 times I went there it was different people yet still really good at their jobs. I even ended up stay after close on day to enjoy a beer with some of the people that worked there. A++ I haven't been to their other location but I can only assume its just as good."

They have a Frank Sinatra style vocalist singing in the dining area every 10-15 minutes. The food however was not outstanding, though it was very good.

The host was pleasant and welcoming, and they had The Godfather playing on of the flat screens behind the bar while a talented singer played Sinatra and Tony Bennett songs. We ordered the Bust-A-Cap appetizer which is mushroom caps stuff with ham and cheese. For the entr\u00e9es, our food came with a choice of soup or salad, now on the menu it says no additional charge for the salad, my only discrepancy is that they charged an additional $2 for the salad on my bill for some reason, but my date enjoyed it very much so I didn't complain about it, just wish I knew why they snuck that charge in there. I ordered the Santucci's Pasta, spaghetti noodles in homemade pasta sauce and homemade meatball which was massive and very tasty even the sauce was really good compared to the store bought stuff. My date ordered the lasagna which was a HUGE chunk in a bowl and she enjoyed it immensely but needed a to-go box to take 3/4 of it home. Overall the experience was great but the only thing i'll have to keep an eye on next time is the reason there is a unsuspecting surcharge to the salad that says on the menu that it comes with the entr\u00e9e."

We are East Coasters - (NJ) so we know a little about NY and good Italian.  The meatballs are GREAT!  The Angels with Dirty Faces - angel hair, peas, mushrooms and pepperoni is fantastic!  Husband had the lasagna and LOVED it.  Cocktails were on the money - not watered down.  Had a Banango (banana/mango) martini made by \"B\".  Was delicious!!! Service was spectacular.  Was my birthday and they all made me feel like famiglia!!  Ask for B as your server - he was so welcoming, attentive - just a great guy!!!  They surprised me with free cannoli for desert - dipped in chocolate and a custard filling - ON THE MONEY!  We will be back - love being locals!  Thank you for such a wonderful night!!"

            "review": "A Chicago-based mob speakeasy, in Vegas? I was so there last Saturday night for one of my very sporadic date nights with the husband. Located in the old Hooters (yeah, I'm from Vegas, I know these things), I saw that they turned that titty-tastic 80's chicken wing place into a dark, somewhat intimate but very entertaining restaurant and lounge which adorns pictures of mafia legends of long ago. Yup, this place definitely did not resemble the raucous orange splattered nipple nightmare of years before. I was impressed. We had 8:45 pm reservations and so upon entering, you must ring the bell and low and behold, the host greets you from a small cut out in the wall above the payphone, to the right of the door and doorbell. Woo, so speakeasy. And since we had those reservations, dude had no problem letting us in. Don't know if a password is required without reservations, but one need only to check their website for more info. But I think reservations would be most advisable. \n\nAnyway, it's a good thing we had a reservation because the place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes past our reservation time. The host even admitted to us that he'd tell us to go to the bar, but considering how packed it was that night, there was no way we were getting a seat at the bar. Once we were finally seated in a booth, not far from the entrance, we waited a little bit for a server. We weren't in a hurry, we didn't have any other plans or anywhere else to be that evening, so to speak. But we were quite hungry and thirsty. \n\nHaving sorta kinda studied the menu before arriving, I chose the eggplant parm and my husband tried the lasagna. We decided against any apps that night, knowing that the entrees would be more than enough. The bread basket came and there were just 5 little slices of what looked like baguette bread with cold individual foil wrapped pads of butter. I was not really impressed with that. If you're an Italian place, offer up warm breads and butter, not this airline bread and butter service! But hey, it's always been said, best not to fill up on bread. So with that, we waited for the cocktails. And because it was a speakeasy and I knew any bar hopping that we may do that night would not offer good red wine, I opted for a dirty martini with blue cheese olives and it was fabulous! The olives were perfect apps for me. The husband had his usual fancy outing drink: a Manhattan. And although dirty martinis go better with steak, I still enjoyed my eggplant parm with my drink. My husband raved about the lasagna, especially the sauce. We each took half of our food home for the next day and it warmed up beautifully. \n\nSo I give it three stars only because of the pokey service and the bread basket. I'd like to give this place another go, possibly take my mom here so that she can check it out. I might even entertain having a steak with my dirty martini next time I visit."

Once we were in and seater, I remembered why I hadn't been there in a while. The place is so dark you have to get the flashlight on your phone to not only read the menu, but see your food. They do have little lights attached to the menus but they aren't bright enough. So they know it's dark and?? Then there's the live entertainment. The music was good, it was very good, but it was SO loud we couldn't converse across the table. The food was ok, nothing special but ok. A bit pricey. The magician who went around was good but again, we had to shine a flashlight on him to see his tricks. It was a fun and unique evening but maybe it's better for the younger set? Our group was 50-62 and it was just too loud and too dark to enjoy. The secret entry is fun and the 3 tourists in our group of 5 found it unique but it didn't overcome the ultimate annoyance at spending the entire meal saying \"what? Huh? Say again? Louder?\" A frustrating evening."

The food was very good and reasonably priced, although nothing really out of the ordinary.  I had Eggplant Parmesan and the others had the Salmon Special (good & garlic-y), Chicken Angelo (portion on the small side) and Chicken Parmesan.  After our cocktails, bread, and salads were served, our waiter went MIA... hey, buddy, we want some vino with our food!  He hadn't been one of the servers of our main courses, and it took a good 10 minutes for the busboy to get the waiter back to our table to take our wine order.  We ended with cappuccino and coffee.  All in all, an enjoyable experience but we'll probably seek out other restaurants (there's a few in Las Vegas!) next time we're in the mood for Italian food."

The entry and the d\u00e9cor for the entire restaurant is 100% on point for the era and the theme they are trying to portray.  Without giving away too many secrets, the hidden door and the speakeasy theme was awesome!  The lunch menu was a little slim, and although great, I would have loved to have more pasta options.  I ended up getting the meatball sandwich and my friend got the chicken parm sandwich.  It was fantastic!!  I wish they would offer a regular salad as a side for the sandwich instead of pasta salad or French friends, but overall the meal and the ambiance was amazing!  I sneaked a peak at the dinner menu and the dinner price point is a little on the high side, with most plates being 20+ dollars."

Had I actually read any reviews (which I did later, after eating a very satisfying meal and no longer wishing to devour the phone from which I was Yelping), my experience would not have been as cool.\n\nI took my friend to Capo's last night, and I didn't tell him anything about it, other than to let him know that I really like the food.\n\nFrom the moment the little window-hole opened in the entry-way, he had a smile on his face.  Capo's really knows how to deliver on ambience.  Everything from the decor to the dark to the hard New York Italian accents on the waiters screams Goodfellas.  I can't imagine anyone not liking the environment here.\n\nThe food is really good as well.  Be warned that the chef at Capo's LOVES garlic.  It is in absolutely everything, in copious amounts, and it is delicious.  Don't miss the Mafioso Caprese from the \"Temptations\" list.  As for entrees, I have tried Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, Vinny's Ala Vodka, and a Cioppino that was offered one night as a special.  Everything was great and garlic-laden.  If you want to speak to anyone after you eat at Capo's, make sure that you take them with you.  If you order Uncle Pauly's, make sure that you feed them some.  I'm being absolutely serious here.\n\nBe prepared to leave extremely full.  Bread, butter, and Parmesan cheese arrive the moment you sit down.  Go ahead and try to resist bread that is still steaming from the oven.  They'll bring your temptation order before they bring the soup or salad that comes with your meal.  You'll love whatever you get.  Then your soup (try the Pasta Faggioli) or salad (Ceasar!) will arrive.  About halfway through that, you'll remember that you have an entree coming, but you won't be able to stop.  If you order a pasta entree, the sauce will be among the most amazing things you've ever tried, so you'll definitely need to take home your leftovers.\n\nAs you might imagine, I have never gotten around to dessert.  It's good to have a goal for next time."

Having worked in Vegas once a month for work this past year, most of the dinners I've had have been very expensive and very poor quality. If you're in town and want to get off the Strip, that's where you'll find some of the better quality of Las Vegas.\nCapos has it all really. The food is wonderful.... I had the Chicken parm, salad and soup. The parm was great and had a light, but very flavorful, sweet marinara sauce. The wedding soup was one of the best I've had in years too. Too much dressing on the salad, but they make their own dressings, so I didn't care. They make it all from scratch.... 4-5 different pasta sauces are available, in addition to alfredo and vodka sauces.\nI was eating on a Wednesday night and they even had live music... a very easy listening Frank Sinatra-like.

Needless to say, I think 2 people ordered a $8 beer but they could have made much more money off us if they allowed the happy hour for the last 30 minutes there was left to encourage more drinking during the meal. Food was super overpriced for what you get. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good but I can make a pasta meal at home that's just as good for $20 for 5 people as opposed to $20-$30/plate. They don't split checks, so come with cash and if you want to split a meal with someone expect to pay $6 more."

It was so dark that mini flashlights were attached to menus.  Food was average, service not so much.

After carefully calculating the receipt the next day (because it was way too dark to read it at Capo's), I discovered we overpaid $19.70.  Also, I asked the waiter to include the tip and he kindly awarded himself 20% -- a little high for the service received.  Sadly, I will not return.

            "review": "Making a memory with a meal is all what its cracked up to be.  Friday night was the second time I had been to this place and it was just as great as I remember.  I scored a groupon $60 for $30 and decided to take some friends who were Capo-virgins.  I do recommend reservations as it does book up.  It took us a few minutes to find the door as it kind of gives you an \"alley way\" entrance to the place.  This is the first time at this location and I actually thought it was more amazing than the last one (on Trop) that I had been to.\n\nUpon entry there is a little mobster suprise experience that you just have to see for yourself.  I don't want to spoil the fun even though I have seen others spill the beans reviews on here. Once you find yourself in the joint, and you are shown your table you will find yourself thinking what century am I in??  The place is dimly lit.  Probably the darkest restaurant I have ever been to but ya know its all about the secretive down low. lol  As we were seated, the 1970s round red leather booths are to die for (but don't say that out loud) along with velvet wallpaper and these amazing chandelliers above the tables....loved them!  They hand you the menus which accompany a little flash light so you can actually see it.  Nice idea.\n\nFor our meal I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Anastasia-lightly breaded and stuffed with ricotta and spinach.  The menu says its topped with pink sauce but it was topped with red sauce and a dab of pink sauce.  I just ordered some more pink sauce and I was good to go.  It came with some angel hair pasta with red sauce.  It was alooot of food to eat but it was so good.  I shared with the table some of the chicken.  I just couldnt eat even half of it.  The BF ordered the Capones Cabanara and he devoured that.  I'm not a fan of peas so I only tried a small bite but it was great.  My friend ordered the spaghetti with meatball (and it was huge).  She said the meatball was full of flavor and the best she ever had.  Her husband ordered the Mad Dog Marsala....which seemed not so big of a plate full but he loved every bite. On a side note I must say that this isnt the \"best\" Italian we've had but it was good and the experience makes it great!\n\nThe wine, bread and salads were a perfect addition.  We all ordered 2 drinks and our drinks were at least half the bill.   No joke.  Thanks for the drinks Groupon! haha  Actually I think the drinks were more than the Groupon but who is counting.  The service was awsome-very attentive and friendly with a Italian mobster edge. lol\n\nDon't forget about the live music \"thats amore\".  Very special touch!  I must say I highly recommend this place.  It is very romantic-great for a date, fun to take some peeps to, and just to stop by and have a drink with the pin striped suits.  My friends loved the experience and the food so a good pat on the back to us for taking them.  Now who can I take next? ;)"

The busser (who was too new to be on his own) actually went twice to the bar to get my parents a new beverage because our waitress was lost again. \n\nTwo out of four food dishes were INCORRECT. When we attempted to let her know the mistakes she argued with us, saying the items didnt come with what we thought they did. Since I STILL HAD A MENU I pointed out that we were right. So, she says to my mom she must have grabbed the wrong plate but tells my bf  \"oh we don't serve mashed potatoes with the $40 steak anymore cause no one likes them\". Ummm something she failed to mention when he placed the order and, also, NOT what the menu said, to which I proved, again, SINCE I HAD A MENU STILL.  She leaves with my mothers dish to replace the incorrect pasta with the roasted potatoes and brings back the same plate with the pasta still on it, and half a spoonful of what the side should have originally been!!???  \n\nLet me also not forget to mention the stacked dishes on the edge of the crumb filled table that neither her or the busser ever picked up yet we stacked to make room for our dinner. Let me also point out that my mother, father and I SHARED two butter knifes for our meals. \n\nOur waitress FINALLY checked on us after we had been sitting with nothing in front of us for quite some time (everything stacked on the edge of the table) and asked if we wanted dessert, which we declined. Not sure why it took her sooooo long to drop the bill, but when I finally started keeping track, two full songs by the piano player had cycled thru....again, that was AFTER I started keeping track. \n\nWhen we left I almost took a picture of the table with stacked dishes, a MENU a couple empty bread plates and butter container (when we didn't even have bread since BEFORE we placed our food order.)\n\nSo, I called today to speak with the manager....... I immediately let her know I was unhappy and calling to let her know about our experience to let them rectify it instead of blasting it all over fb or yelp, which she was thankful for, then asked me to hold a moment.   Toni, (the GM) put the phone down and had a conversation with someone else on another phone...that I could hear every word of!!!!!! \"Whatcha doing? ......Oh yeah, I accidentally put myself on the schedule and working so now I'm short staffed........ Yeah, I'm hoping so and so calls me back too...... yeah, I can't believe i did either. Blah blah blah\" for almost four full minutes!!! Are you fng kidding me? \n\nSo when she gets back on the phone she goes so what happened? And I told her to hold on cause I'm really annoyed she just held that whole conversation with an upset customer on the phone waiting who could hear every word. Her response? \"She called first\"... And I said that's awesome, but you should have let her go as soon as you found out she wasn't available instead of carrying on a conversation that I could hear!!!!! That's when she told me not to tell her how to run her business.  I hung up ...  Not going to have much of a business if she treats customers like that.\n\nSo, basically  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!  The food is great (if you get the correct order) BUT THE SERVICE FROM BUSSER TO UPPER MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE!!!!!"

Also I enjoy when local places are willing to donate meals to other local establishments or events. \nThe first time I came here, the secret door threw me way off. I won't say too much and ruin in. I will say enjoy it, and play along. This time, I had my 16 year old step son and he was confused and thought we took him to a closed gangster establishment. His reaction was worth it alone. \nThe lighting is dim, and your menus come with small lights for those who may not be able to see the menu in the dark. (ie: me) There is live entertainment, and a cheesy mob boss who is kind of hanging out and running things. Although he is very involved and I don't believe he sees himself as cheesy one bit. The godfather is playing in the background. (Last time it was Casino) There is even a man selling roses. They go all out with the old school speakeasy type of vibe. \nThe service was mediocre, don't get me wrong our waitress was pleasant. But slow, and un-attentive. Our drinks went empty and the bread basket was out, often. \nThe food however made up for it. Meatballs and peppers appetizer is a must. The meatballs are a good quality meat that melt in your mouth the way they should. Just the right amount of spice lingers on your tongue leaving you hungrier than when you arrived. The pasta in all the dishes seemed like they were made in house. The bread and cheeses were fresh and authentic, and the salad came with a great house dressing. I didn't like the cheesecake, but unless its straight from NY or Cheesecake Factory, I usually don't. \nOverall, its high priced, but the atmosphere helps out and easily makes this a great place for a date night or special occasion."

MUST READ! \n\nThis is my first time to sit down and write a review about anything but after tonight I can't keep quiet. \nI've been going to Capos for years to starting with there first location on Tropicana. I must say the food is always great. I've celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, New Years eve and just for the hell of it lets go to Capos. But, tonight was the worst experience I had. \nFirst we get greeted by the rudest man at the door he has no smile, no warmth, you can tell he was flustered. We're sitting with another couple waiting for a table. He calls both of us up and seats us in this \"private room\" next to each other. With no menus. And the room had to be hitting 85 degrees and humidity 120. After sitting for about 5 some one dropped off menus. The place is so dark you need a little flash light to read the menu MINE DIDNT work. I had to ask about the Chefs Specials for the night. \nI get up and ask what i think is a host slash manager slash mater'd to either A. turn the air down in that room or B. Move us to the main dinning room where you can tell it's much cooler by like 10 degrees. He intel responds in his rude italian over worked voice \"thats gonna be 20 minutes or so\". I go back to my table start fanning my self and just waiting for an open table. He comes up to our table and says \"you can eat at the  bar if you want\". I told him i didn't make a reservation to sit at the \"bar\". He responds with \"what do you want me to do then\"? With his face in my face and body language like he wanted to pounce on me. I just tell him \"TO FIX THE PROBLEM\" either fix the air or move me. He storms off. \nBy this time one or our appetizers hits our table. So we start eating the waitress comes up to us with our second appetizer and says your other table is ready. Im like great picked up my glass and bottled water and followed her leaving our first appetizer at the original table. We get sat in a booth in the main dinning room. First relief because its much cooler. Then we realize the table had not been wiped from the  previous guest ( which by this point that did not bug me at all). The buss boy sees that and wiped the table for us and apologizes. \nWell wed like to eat our salads that were dropped off with our second appetizer but we have no utensils. We tell our server that our calamari is on the table still she respond \"i thought you where done with that\"? I had about 4 bites. So she goes back im thinking shes retrieving our appetizer or re firing a new one. Finally we get our silver ware by the bus boy and no bread. \nWe ask her wheres our calamari she says \" you ate most of it\" so by this point now shes being rude and defensive. So i tell her \" am i S.O.L on my calamari? She responds with well i can have them make a half batch because you ate half. I looked at her and i almost wanted to just over turn my table in that restaurant. \nIm like i want my check im OUT OF HERE...... She gets her manager slash host slash mater'd. And hes like why are they leaving ? i did everything they wanted. He tells her to fire a calamari. By this point its to late I let him have it. Im so disgusted by the customer service theres no way to fix the situation. I told him ive been in the hospitality industry for 12 years and thats not the way you handle a situation. His last words to me where \"Wheres your restaurant ill go eat there\".....\n\nI HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN SUCH DISGUSTING, VILE, HOSTILE PLACE IN MY LIFE. I dont have a restaurant THANK GOD! But let me tell you this i never made a customer that mad that he stormed out of the restaurant i was managing. Im posting this on YELP, and on my Facebook that has over 500 friends, family, and clients. \n\nAnd let me tell you this i see my clients daily and we do is talk about Las Vegas food, shows, restaurants, As god as my witness i will bad mouth you and tell everyone i ever meet about this experience. When i have friends come to Vegas this is one Restaurant that i will not be taking them to. \n\nSo keep up the great work and the great customer service. Maybe thats why your first original location closed, and thats why you have 2 for 1 on Tuesdays and you are on groupon every other day. Bigger better restaurants have closed there doors you can too..............\n\n\nWith out us THE CUSTOMERS REMEMBER YOU ARE NOTHING !!!!!!!!\n\nI HOPE YOU THE WORST I HOPE YOU CLOSE AND I HOPE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB IN LAS VEGAS.........\n\n\nDISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING !"

Yes it was dark , but that was ok. Bathrooms are one person only and small , but again that's ok. \nThe meal. \nFirst , we were on time for our reservation and our table was open , but we had to sit at the bar for 10 minutes, just enough time to order a drink which the tab had to be closed out before going to the table. My GF order one of their specialty cocktails, it was good. I asked for a glass of the house Chianti, the barmaid said they did not have one. Ok, I will wait and order something at the table. \nOnce seated we were give the menu's with the flashlights, well one of the two had flashlights, and a wine list. Sure enough on the first page was a list of wine's by the glass and there was a Chianti.......sigh.... It was tasty and I had two of them. \nThe menu was creative with all of the mob names. The bread was great , hot and fresh, but then you had to struggle with the butter in the little foil packets. \nBoth of our salads had potential, but ended up being a little watery. She likes Ranch, not on the Capo's list. \nThe calamari was very tasty, fried with some hot peppers and dipping sauce like Outbacks Bloomin Onion sauce. \nFor dinner we went with the basics \nHer Lasagna was ok , very cheesy , and a bit over cooked. \nMy spaghetti was cooked fine, it was just smother in red sauce and the kitchen sprinkled Parmesan cheese on it for me... I did not ask for it and I do not normally put it on my pasta. \nOn the upside the Italian sausage I added to the dish was pretty good. \nWe did not have dessert. \nService throughout the dinner was good \nThey called a cab for us and let me know when it arrived. \nThe bill for two drinks each and dinner was $86.00 plus tip \nSo the rating was more for the food then the rest of the dining experience. \nI do not see myself going back, to many other places to try"

While casual dress is ok, I felt under-dressed wearing jeans as many were dressed a little bit more formal.\n\nThen the tables that were empty were already reserved. So, my friends and I ended up dining at the bar. Oh boy! I was happy that we ended up at the bar! You can see all the live actions while they cook and prepare your meals. They have TVs at the bar and a live singer by the piano at the center of the restaurant (I came in at the right night). It's really awesome! \n\nI ordered Tony Duck's soup and Spaghetti with Meatballs. The soup does not contain any duck. It has spinach and eggs with such a flavorful broth! I came here to try out their spaghetti with meatballs and it was delicious! The homemade meatball was bigger than my fist. It was moist and did not fall apart when slicing. The marinara was well flavored and good consistency. I prefer my pasta a little thicker though. \n\nThis is one of the great dining experience I would not hesitate to take my family and friends when visiting town.

I can't believe I only just now found out about Capos (thanks Yelp!).\n\nI highly recommend Capos for a romantic date night or large groups of friends. It's also a reliable attraction for your stubborn Midwestern relatives who refuse to eat hummus and sushi.\n\nMy husband and I intended to enjoy \"Fuggedaboudit Fridays,\" but Capos said \"fuggit\" to that happy hour special. But the bar honored the deal because they're cool like that.\n\nMy husband and I split the shrimp scampi appetizer, which is only about five pieces of average sized shrimp set on top of a bed of delicious bread that's soaked in butter and garlic. It was delicious but a little overpriced. Order it during happy hour instead. By the way, an interesting event happened while we sat at the bar. The mobbish door dudes fireman-carried a drunk man from the front door to the back. I don't know if the drunkard was hired to enter the restaurant that way but I thought, \"Wow. That really completes the mob atmosphere.\"\n\nFor dinner my husband and I sat in one of the red round booths, split a chicken marsala (I think) and a bottle of old vine Zinfandel ($35). I would have eaten more if I wasn't counting calories. \n\nCapos deserves at least 4.5 stars, based on my first visit. I haven't tried enough of the menu to give it five. Right now, though, I favor Capos over Nora's and Herbs & Rye."

Since they have moved from the Trop location to Sahara this restaurant has gone seriously down hill, each time I go worse than the visit before.\nI was greeted by the door guy, always somewhat gruff, but this time was very rude. Like why was I here, dinner?  Imagine that.   Then while we were enjoying a pre dinner drink at the bar, we requested a table.  The \"host\" which was the same guy from the door, seats us at a booth, one of several that were vacant.  Then he tells us that they are all reserved and he can give it to us if we make it \"worth his while\". So we tip him $5 as we walked all of 2 feet from the bar and figured he was just acting out the Chicago wise guy persona.\nHe said, you can give me another one of those and stood there expecting more tip.\nVery odd indeed. It's not like he put much effort into it, and the booths remained empty throughout our dinner so they were not all reseved after all.\nThe dinner was okay, service was decent, food was decent, but overall the restaurant had a dirty, dingy feel to it.\nThe icing on the cake was the experience at the table next to us, where one of the guest was stung by a scorpion while he ate dinner.  He even took a picture of it! So, if there are scorpions, which to Capos' defense, are native to the SW part of town, then you know there are other bugs and they definitely are not proactively preventing them from being in their facility.\nOverall, I would saw last night's visit will definitely be the last.\nNot enough good to convince me it's worth spending money there."

If you are vegetarian, spend the extra $5 to add a veggie meatball to any entree, you won't be sorry. Fast, friendly service. 1 star taken off for overall experience, because we were seated in a curtained off area which seemed like \"overflow\" back by the kitchen and it was pretty noisy.

Sometimes you get way too caught up with making sure that you stay in particular hotels, or eat in big name restaurants, but every once in awhile you will find a diamond in the rough so to speak. At the recommendation of a local here 5 of us set out to Capos a speak easy type old style Italian dining experience. \n\nFrom the minute you walk in the door you are no longer at the Bellagio, the Wynn but back to the days of yesteryear when old style Italian Salons ruled the Vegas Empire.  A dark type setting with booths, tables, long wooden bar is your ambience with Godfather & Goodfellas movies playing in the background and Bobby walking the room singing your old time Sinatra & Vale favorites you know you are in for something different and with hope special as well. \n\nPrices are inexpensive here as all meals come with choice of soup or salad and several drinks at the bar were charged at Happy Hour prices even though it was almost 9PM when we got there nice touch. After sitting we ordered two orders of their meatballs and peppers with homemade spicy sauce and a Chi Town Shrimp scampi. Fresh bread with Garlic butter was fresh and excellent.  These 3 appetizers were more than enough to split for 5.  The meatballs were large not very moist but the tasty, fresh and the sauce very spicy but an excellent accoutrement to this very interesting presentation.  The Shrimp were over bread soaked in scampi sauce. Shrimp a little on the hard side, but the sauce was extremely tasty and very good.\n\nSoups and 1 salad ordered as part of meals. Two Wedding Soups with chunks of Sirloin steak were as expected, the pasta fagoli interesting and again very tasty salads were a wet blue cheese that were very cold and fresh. Again all orders quite large and these were included in the entrees.\n\nDinners:  Traffacanti Rigatoni was stuffed pasta with Cheese Procusitto in a creamy Alfredo sauce. Excellent dish but there was no mention on the menu that the Rigatoni was \"Spinach Rigatoni\" this was fine as I like that but we were splitting up the dishes and it would have been nice to have known.  A stuffed Chicken Anastasia with Ricotta, Spinach covered in a pink sauce was as described and very tasty with a light coating of bread crumb as well.  A linguini carbarnaro with chicken was one of the best dishes on the table, but it had a tough time competing with the Linguine with fresh white clam sauce. These 4 dishes were split to 5 people & none of us could move after this.  \n\nTheir Espresso, Cappuccino machine was not working so we skipped desert and coffee enjoyed another drink on the house by the owner and listened to Bobby belt out Sinatra. Tough to leave this little gem but all good things must come to an end.  Very well kept little secret that will definitely be a return trip for me next time I'm in town"

The host was wearing a nice Italian looking suit and the ambiance and decor of the restaurant screams Little Italy, even though it has a tattoo parlor and a check cashing place right next door.\n\nOnce we were seated, the waitress came over and offered us drinks and told us about the specials which were described excellently.  She left and a moment later an assistant had bread and our drinks.  We ordered a few moments later and the service never stopped being superb.\n\nThe food came out and it was excellent.  I had the ribeye with blue cheese crumb crust and spaghetti on the side with a caesar salad.  Very delicious.  We stayed in the restaurant for 2 hours but never felt rushed or pressured to leave.  The live music that was playing in the background I didn't even realize it was live until I caught a glimpse of the singer.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend it.  Whether its for a romantic date or just dinner with a good friend, the place works for either occasion."

I came here especially for the veal parmigiana. let's get started on the food I ordered linguine and clams with red sauce. well the clams was so like rubber I had to chew each claim for 10 minutes and still ending up swallowing the whole claM that's how rubber way they were. then I also ordered shrimp scampi and I had them put prosciutto and sundried tomatoes which I seen was already in another dish but do not like the garlic cream sauce and fettuccine I wanted angel hair with the shrimp scampi sauce so that's why I added to the sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto witch cost extra actual which I had no idea it was going to cost extra since it was already on the menu but anyways the prosciutto was actually deli ham it was not prosciutto at all. but other than that the shrimp scampi was the only good thing oh almost forgot the appetizers we ordered the calamari which was also rubber very very very bad rubber and undercooked and the breading did not stay on  as soon as you pick it up the breading will fall off and it was rubber and just terrible. we also got the fried mushrooms they were out of a can they were not fresh mushrooms They from a can. also got their famous meatball I did not see anything famous about it just an ordinary meatball. ask for the service I had a very bad waitress don't know her name kept giving me attitude and Service was just not what I expected very bad and did not feel welcome at all I was actually afraid for her to take a picture of me for my birthday. I seen the other waiters they have personality joking laughing suggesting menu items mine  did not do any of that. as for entertainment it wasn't the regular guy in the other reviews that sings Frank Sinatra Dean Martin it was some other guy that sang like Billie Joe or things like that and mostly played piano maybe for like 2 songs and then the rest was just recording music radio. restaurant is super small and stuffy I thought it would have been a bigger nicer restaurants.so that was it they messed up my birthday had the worst birthday ever not what I expected from other reviews foods with nothing great actually pretty bad service was pretty bad also the only thing that was nice with the decorations and old mafia pictures inside the restaurant and on the building that was it not too sure if I'll come back .there's also no magic man doing tricks I did see him going to table but he did not come to ours"

The busboy also made our day by moving us to a larger table, as my family are big eater (\"foodies\")...to accommodate all the dishes.  You have to try this place if you are visiting.

We had first seen the Capo's restaurant when driving around Las Vegas on a previous trip - so we had it 'marked' (if you will) for our next visit.\n\nNothing short of amazing is what I would say.  The service was fantastic - we mentioned in casual conversation with our waiter that it was our 20th anniversary and before we knew it, we were being acknowledged by the bar singer.  He dedicated a song to my wife and I and it *just happened* to be her absolute favorite song -  Unforgettable by Nat King Cole.  Coincidence?  Maybe - but it really set the mood for the rest of the evening.\n\nEither the owner or the chef came around to our tables during the evening to see how we liked our 'experience.'  He carried on a 5 minute conversation with us which was fantastic.  He did not seem hurried or the usual 'How was your dinner' and then on to the next table.  It was yet another very nice touch.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place had about four or five other patrons in it.  We got there about 6:00PM on a Wednesday.  By the time we left (about 8:00 or so), the restaurant was about half-full.\n\nOverall, the food was simply fantastic.  We've had lots of Italian food - including Italian food from places in Chicago, and both my wife and I agreed that this was the best we had had.  I highly suggest you try out Capo's if you're in the neighborhood.  It's worth the 10 minute drive from the strip."

            "review": "God, I wish I could give this place a better review! The atmosphere and the idea of it is so fun and unique and I was so excited to be going to a place featured on the show Man Finds Food. The first time I went here was 8/30/15 with a small group and I had so much fun! The Frank Sinatra singer was fun, the magician that came around to each table was entertaining and the eggplant parmesan was the best I had tried in Vegas.\n\nWHAT WENT WRONG: Visit on 12/10/15\n\nMy parents were visiting from MI and I couldn't wait to take them to Capo's as part of an early Christmas gift. This would be my second time there. We made reservations on a Thursday night around 7:30 p.m. thinking it wouldn't be too busy. We arrived 10 mins late due to traffic and when we got there they still didn't have our table ready. The inside of the restaurant was uncomfortably hot inside and there are no windows to let in the air. We had to wait 15 mins standing by the bar because there were no seats available at the bar and I felt like I might melt from the temperature. There were a couple tables open and I'm not sure why they weren't offered to us. When they had our seats ready, we had to wait another 15 mins for our waitress Ashley to arrive. It was really strange we were waiting so long when we had reservations. \n\nWe ordered our food and I made it really clear to Ashley that my mom was vegetarian (I even told her she had been a vegetarian for 40 years) and wanted the VEGETARIAN meatball. Our entrees came and my mom started eating her food and said, \"this tastes like beef.\" I tried a bite of it and felt sick the rest of the night. We couldn't find our waitress anywhere to alert her of the mistake. My mom said, \"it really seems like we're not getting any attention at our table tonight.\" My dad ended up flagging down a busser to tell him about the mistake. The order was sent back to the kitchen and the meatball was corrected and we finally saw our waitress again. We told her about the meatball and I also had to ask for a basket of their complimentary bread because she hadn't brought any out when we were seated. By the time my mom's meatball and the bread basket arrived at the table my dad and I were finished eating and my mom had to eat alone - we didn't get to enjoy Christmas dinner together :/ I've never received a bread basket at the end of my meal before at any other restaurant. My mom also felt sick from eating the beef and we didn't get our waters refilled once. I felt awful.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place one star is because the guy singing the Frank Sinatra hits was attentive to us and made my mom smile. We left him a big tip. I really wouldn't recommend this place at this point. I work at a local hospital  in Vegas and I see firsthand the damage food poisoning/food allergies can wreck, plus the wait service was REALLY poor.\n\nThis place is too far from the heart of Vegas to make it worth venturing out to for the low quality and the price. I don't recommend this place to anyone any more, esp. if you're a vegetarian or have a special diet. For good, quality Italian food/better service, I recommend Ventanos. It is where I will take my parents the next time they are in town. I really regret having a Christmas dinner at Capo's."

Good Italian is hard to come by in San Diego, so when I took my first vacation in over 3 years with the wife, and without the kids, I bolted to Capo's like a fat man to the Paris buffett, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe Host was warm and funny.  The server, I believe his name is Chad, was both friendly and patient.  The calamari appetizer and the Cesar salad were my favorite, and the eggplant canolli was probably the best I ever had.\n\nWith all that said, the best part of Capo's is the ambiance, I felt like I was eating in Capone's dining room.\n\nTip:  The mix drinks costs less than a glass of wine, in my opinion this was the better way to go.  I ordered the \"Watermelon\" martini drink, and it was both refreshing and potent."

It's very dimly lit, but I personally felt it added to the ambiance.\n\n2) You're going to overeat on this amazing food and need to roll yourself out the door!"

You have to ring a doorbell before you walk in and once you enter there is dim lighting, a guy singing, and an overall fun atmosphere. The staff was really friendly and attentive. The dark lighting makes it hard to read the menus but good thing they have flashlights inside. Definitely try the salad with the garlic dressing it is so delicious. I got the arrabiata pasta and added a meatball and was so disappointed our hotel didn't have a fridge because I would have loved to eat the left overs. This is a great place to go for a date or as a group. Even though it is a little off the strip it is totally worth it for the great experience. Capo's is definitely a place I will be returning to next time I am in Vegas. We also made reservations..not sure if it is required but I would definitely recommend it. We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time and were immediately seated."

It was very dark inside, so dark inside the menus have little lights in them. There was also a guy who sang and when round to all the tables. He was rather irritating... Ignore him and he'll leave. And he totally put his own money in his tip jar when he set up!\n\nService - Our server was very attentive and despite other reviews I read that said they are rude when you have a groupon, we used a groupon and they were great.\n\nFood - BORING. I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp... There weren't even croutons on it... And that was the only green salad on the menu. My boyfriend had a pasta dish. It was average.

Made reservations a week in advanced and requested a Dining room booth- we were the only couple seated in bar. Had to watch 5 parties of 2 arrive long after us seated in dining area. We wanted to enjoy music and atmosphere but instead had a disappointing dining experience. Sign outside says Tuesday 2 for 1 but be aware it's only for locals. Our server and bus person were the highlights of Capos. our first experience a year ago left a bad taste in our mouths but gave it another chance since we live near by but Capos get outta here! Never again."

I found this great steal for Capo's on restaurant.com, and decided that this is where I wanted to go.\n\nLooks can be very decieving, and you certainly can't judge a book by its cover. From the outside, it looked like some crazy run down saloon. I had to convince myself to go further into the restaurant hoping for more interior possas than the outter exterior. When I entered into the restaurant, I was trapped inside a fairly small room. A small computer printed sign directed us to ring the door bell, and rang the door bell is what we did! Up pops open this small peep hole where a gentleman asks if we had reservations. Replying, \"yes\" the phonebooth swings open! Just like the good old days when the prohibition laws were in effect, and the booze was sure to be marvelous.\n\nA mobster looking gentleman, all suited up, guides us through this really dark restaurant, but even the darkness couldn't hide the small awesome crystal chandeliers, vintage wallpaper, and plush seats! I really felt like I was smack dab in the middle of an episode of Boardwalk Empire! \n\nI ordered the clam linuini with white wine sauce, and my partner ordered the veal marsala with angel hair pasta. My pasta was delish! If you're looking for a less filling and very light pasta dish, this would be it! I never finish my pasta, but this time I was really sad that I walked away with no takeout. The sauce was perfect. It was very light and soft, with the taste of the clams lingering in the sauce! You know that they put LEGITIMATE clams in there if the clams were tossed on your plate with the shells still on. NO CANNED CLAMS HERE! \n\nI can't really vouch for the veal marsala, but from what I heard and smelled, it is pretty good. It smelled like it had a very strong tangy taste to it. I was almost to tears when I sat watching my partner eat that poor baby cow...HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO COW UNIVERSITY YET! Have you no humanity friend!!!!!!!!!\n\nWell, to wash those sad sorrows for the baby cow away, we had the bread pudding with vanilla icing for dessert. The bread pudding is DEVINE! Super soft, filling, light sweetness, and very nutty!  I felt like it was such a small portion, but being full I couldn't complain. Its such a wonderful dessert, but BEWARE! The portions are really small. \n\nLastly, the staf was A+! The bussers kept taking out empty plates, filling cups, and making sure that they were accomodating. Ellie our server was very helpful with suggestions, and was really nice. Overall, it was a great birthday date! I had a great time, and my partner did too! It's a great date place, but be careful, depending on what the girl date maybe in to, this might make or break the date. But, I can say that men would have a great time here!"

Don't get me wrong, he was fantastic, but we couldn't carry on a conversation until we had to move into another room.\nWe started out with some great apps.  The fried ravioli, meatballs and the \"off the menu\" leftovers dish that our waitress (Janine) cut into 8 portions since it is normally served as a healthy sized entr\u00e9e.  It was fantastic.  The fried ravioli was pretty good, but would have preferred a meat filling vs. ricotta cheese.  The meatballs were as good as they get.  Everyone commented for days about how good they were.\nMy wife kept it light and just got a chicken Caesar salad and loved it.  I had the veal parmesan and loved it.  Everyone was so impressed with each of their entrees, we were sharing bites from across the table for an hour.\nOur entire group is from Chicago and an Al Capone Speakeasy was of interest to all of us.  We know our Italian food and I've been traveling to Vegas for nearly 40 years and had some of the best Italian food in the world while visiting there.  We've been to dozens of places including Piero's and have to say this meal was as good as it gets in that town, if not better in many ways including very fair prices.  It was only a 15 minute ride from the strip and we WILL be going back.\nJanine (our waitress), if you're reading this, thank you for the superior service.  You really made the evening that much more special for us."

We enjoyed the singer doing Sinatra songs while walking aound the room. The food is very good with the portions being enough to fill you up. Consequently we did not have room for dessert. The chicken picata with garlic mash was excellent as well as the veal picata with mushroom risotto. The only downside to the food was the crusty bread was dried out on the inside.\nThe night of our visit the service could have been better. First our server did not offer us water. She seemed to disappear for a while and we had a hard time flagging down another person to help us. The restaurant was full. There was a group of about 20 people at one table. They could have had more servers. Resolving these items will add other star."

We were seated toward the front where the bar area is, which was disappointing as I wanted the more formal, romantic atmosphere of the dining room. So I know in the future to request a dining room table.\n\nWe ordered the antipasto appetizer, but it arrived without cheese. HUH?! How does one NOT put cheese on an antipasto? Isn't that like Italian Cooking 101? The meats, lettuce and balsamic dressing were wonderful, but it needed the cheese for balance. After what seemed to be a communication issue with our server, to where he actually told me that the dish does not come with cheese ... I then showed him the description on the menu which clearly stated \"meats AND cheeses\".  Only then did he seem to get it, apologize, and offer to get us another. We both had the Pasta Fagioli soup and enjoyed it very much along with the yummy bread basket.\n\nI enjoyed Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata Rigatoni with spicey garlic sauce. I also ordered a meatball (really good), which was initially forgotten and no doubt was off cavorting somewhere with my lost antipasto cheeses.  But our waiter fetched me a meatball and I was happy. My date enjoyed his cheesey mushroom ravioli dish, although it seemed a little overcooked and pasty to my taste.\n\nThe Tiramisu was delicious with an after-dinner espresso to kick my energy level back up to pre-pasta levels.\n\nAll in all, Capo's is a different kind of dining experience and their food is good, but I was not wow'd.  Would probably return, but not in any hurry to do so, and must remember to request the dining room next time."

I really don't understand this concept and never heard of any restaurant having this policy. Our bill was $270 for 7 people and of course we were expecting it to be half of that. I spoke to the manager after we received the bill and she explained this was their new policy. She did deduct $20.

The eggplant Parmesan was covered in cheese that turned very hard and chewy like string cheese. The pasta noodles was soft and mushy and the red sauce was very bland.

Remembering the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot.  The inside of the restaurant is beautiful.  Very romantic with live music.

We watched the bar manager argue with the musician to sing more and drink less, the kitchen is open and watched all the food being prepared and the cooks talk back and forth between each other and wrangle over each other to get the food cooked, and watched the matre d' yell at people in the \"secret entrance\" about coming in.  Had we been sitting in the dinning room we would have missed all this.  And this may not be for all people, but we loved it.  I am so over personality-less drones asking me if I have ever tried their world famous chicken poppers, or something to that effect.  \n\nWe got there around 5pm and it was pretty slow, by the time we left at 7pm the place was packed.  It turns out that we were there on Tuesday which is there 2 - 1 Tuesday, 2 entrees for the price of 1.  The bf and I decided to come back on another Tuesday to try the entree menu.  \n\nThe only downside was that we ordered deserts to go, the bf got a red velvet cheesecake and I got the bread pudding.  I don't really like either cheesecake or red velvet (both are highly overrated as far as I'm concerned), but I did try a bite of his and could appreciate it.  Unfortunately the bread pudding was a fail.  It was more like cinnamon french toast, not really what I wanted.  I still won't reduce a star for that though, I just won't order it again."

(I won't say more on this, except it's pretty cool). It's set up like the mob-days of Vegas, and it's really dark inside. Red walls, dark lighting, Sinatra playing over the speakers, mob movies on the TV, and it's just like walking backwards in time. \n\nHubs had the meatball sandwich, which he enjoyed. The sauce was really good too. I had the carbonara, which blew me away! I really enjoyed it with chunks of prosciutto in the sauce. Oh, heaven! \n\nIf you are in Vegas, this is one place that will take you back to old Vegas, and It's really yummy!"

We got a semi-private table away from the main floor. The food was amazingly reasonable for what I thought it would be. And super delicious. Fantastic ambiance with the singer walking around singing Sinatra all night. The staff was top shelf, not stuck up, not pushy, and friendly even when we were a little tipsy and being silly. The lighting is low and romantic. I highly recommend this place!!"

The service our first time around was fantastic and attentive; but last time we went, it was non-existent. \n\nBeing from NYC, the Italian cuisine is not the best I've had, but for being in Vegas, I suppose it's pretty good. Honestly the best part of the entire establishment is how they're set up: the entry is entertaining and the decor is also a lot of fun. It's a great place to take your friends from out of town, because it is in some ways a touristy gimmick. \n\nHere's a tip: Go on restaurant.com for a gift certificate and save $$ on your check. Make a reservation, it's safer to do so and doesn't hurt!"

It's all part of the feel and experience of this restaurant. You walk in to a dimly lit dining room and bar and with Frank Sinatra music playing, felt like something in a movie. We got to sit in a corner booth and order our meal from a waiter with an Brooklyn Italian accent, just a very cool experience. \n\nThe reason we dropped in is because we got a Groupon for a prix fixe lunch for two which included a soda, salad and entree for $20. What an great deal. The Italian house salad was fresh and dressed with zesty Italian dressing and Parmesan. I ordered the carbonara with chicken as recommended by the waiter and the lady sitting in the booth next to us and it was not at all disappointing. Creamy sauce, perfectly cooked pasta, tender chicken, peas scattered within. Yum! I wasn't able to finish it because it was quite a large serving for lunch so the waiter brought me a large togo box for me. My fianc\u00e9 got the meatball sub and of course I had to try it. The meatballs were huge! They were tender and so flavorful. The bread was baked to perfection and the marinara sauce that came with it was super fresh, you could just taste all the fresh tomatoes in it. \n\nThis place is awesome. The experience is definitely one of a kind. If you haven't been, you have to at least check it out once. I've never been to a place like it. It's something you would expect in New York's Little Italy. What a fun place. I know I'll be back to bring my family when they visit. I know they'll get a kick out of it."

We spent the next 45 minutes trying to deal with one thing after another: funky new dressing, funky salad which he accidentally charged for as it was a swap for the pasta, we ordered a meatball but no meatball arrived, waited another 20 minutes for that lasagna to get boxed up, etc... Too much management required. Oyy.\n\nMy previous stellar review, which I was delighted to write, belonged to the previous chef.

Love the mob them and the entrance is wonderful and unique. As you go in, you see the bar first and all the memorabilia from the wise guys era. The booths are old school and at this point everything is awesome. However, I am not a I need a flashlight to read your menu kinda guy. I am sure this is part of the ambiance, but It is not for me. Perfect place for a first date. We sat down and had our waitress (cant remember her name) she was kind and nice and very obnoxious as a old school waitress from back East should be. She stated that she had been there for over 13 years so that tells me about the loyalty here as this is not found in the food business anymore so my hat off to these people for treating their employees right. My son and I had the Lasagna and my girlfriend had the raviolis. The salad was on point and the bread was excellent. Before our food came we got the treat of the magician on staff. He is WONDERFUL if you have children and his tricks blew my mind as I sat 1 ft away. The singing is awesome (everything you would expect from an Italian joint) and overall at this point a wonderful dining experience. Our food came and I have to tell you, this is the first Lasagna that I had to eat slow so I could savor how delicious it was. My son stated the same and its just lasagna for Christ sake. I have had this dish at least 500 times from my girl and had to hurt her feelings \"BABE YOUR LASAGNA SUCKS COMPARED TO THIS\"..... dinner was over and we had the cannolis. EXCELLENT....took them home so the little ones could indulge. Prices were a little steep for the food to price ratio. I will deff be back as I cant wait to try a more difficult dish. Again, your going on a first date, this place will break the ice for you up to 80%....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CAPOS ITALIAN CUISINE......"

Some mixed reviews but honestly I am always up to try new things and I M sure glad I did!! First.. Read the previous reviews.  You will have a better understanding of what to expect.  Yes it is off the strip and takes about 20 mins to get there.  Google directions ppl if driving too far is a problem.  Next, the entrance is unconventional.  It is somewhat hidden and that is part of the \"theme\".  Keep in mind, everything this place does seems intentional to me.  From the stuffy host, the gimmick about being too full, all of it.  Part of why I loved it so much.  We made reservations for a Saturday night and all that was available was 9pm. My husband and I decided on a whim to go early and see if we could get in.  We got a little push back but they gave us a great seat and the rest was wonderful.  Again I wasn't offended... All part of the act.  Food was great but the meatballs were AMAZING! So glad we decided to add those on.  Great service, we were serenaded to and the food was fabulous.  Will definitely be back!"

He ordered a captain and coke which tasted like a glass of captain and a drop of coke (always good). First came the bread and the garlic butter that came with it was what made the bread awesome, it would have been nothing special with out it. Then the salads, I got the house salad with Italian dressing. It was honestly the best house salad ever, it had marinated tomatoes and artichoke hearts on it and the dressing was incredible. I ordered Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, just the right amount of spicy for a pasta dish. I loved it. He ordered the Alfredo and bragged about how awesome it was all night."

It was dark, very cozy and had lighting in the right places. The waitress was very attentive and was always checking in with us. There was a man singing who had an amazing baritone voice and sang Frank Sinatra songs throughout our dinner. The appetizers were cooked perfectly and the entrees were delicious. I wasn't even done with my dinner and was completely full, didn't know what to do with myself when they brought the dessert menu. I went ahead and ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e  and it was delicious. The prices are fair compared to other Italian restaurants and much better in my opinion. I will definitely be returning to try other dishes. There were a few negatives that caught our attention. The host was very friendly to me but never directed a word to my boyfriend. He wasn't mean or rude but he didn't seem to acknowledge his presence. I noticed this with other groups as well. Another was that they didn't have a beer list or menu. The waitress didn't really know all the available beers to choose from. The last one is in regards to space. There was a party of 8 that were seated in front of us and it was quite awkward trying to maneuver our way to the exit. We had to ask a few people to move their chair so we could get out. All minor negatives compared to the food."

My dish was good, and a very large portion which I was happy to see for the hefty $21 price, but the sausage and peppers were overly salty for my taste.\n\nWe didn't see our server too much, she was busy tending to a larger party that was seated after us. Our water lacked refills, we weren't checked on after our dinner was dropped off, and when we asked for a dessert menu she dropped off a closed book but when we opened it there was no menu inside.

He's very good! \n\nIn addition, regarding our uneventful night, I should point out that I did contact a Manager. I spoke to Dominic (sp?). He was very kind and apologetic. He said that the next time we're in town, let him know. He'll make sure it will be a more enjoyable moment. That's cool and I appreciate his offer. But that doesn't erase the fact of what had happened that night. What was worse - it wasn't just one bad thing. It was three consecutive mistakes, one right after the other, and all by the same person, our server, ASHLEY. \n\n1. When a salad is included with your dinner order, the server will read off the choices. Easy, right? Most of us know this drill, simple. Done. Not exactly. Ashley read off the choices of salads that come with our dinner, including Caesar Salad. We ordered Caesar. \n\n2. Cocktails. We ordered two Vodka Collins. Easy to make. A regular drink for us. Unless specified, unless we \"call\" the type of Vodka, the establishment will give you House Vodka. \n\n3. The bill.  Just over $160.00. We pay with cash,  2-one hundred dollar bills. Easy math. 200 minus 160, forty dollars change. Give or take the loose change. But still, simple math, nothing hard. \n\nBut here's the thing... Although she reads off the salads as if they were our choices that come with the dinners, the Caesar salads were actually an extra charge. Not once did she say something along the lines of \"Caesar is extra, is that okay?\"  If she had mentioned this, I promise you we would have said \"yes, that's good.\" Instead, she decided to keep this bit of info from us. \n\nOur Vodka drinks. Although we did our usual ordering of \"Vodka Collins\", and not a \"Call drink\", she went ahead and used Kettle One Vodka, not a house Vodka. In other words, yes, there was an extra charge for that, too.\n\nOur bill. Knowing we should receive approximately forty dollars back, Ashley returned with the change. She left. We opened it, double checked everything, and btw, this is when we also saw the above problems. But to top it off... she didn't short change us fifty cents, not even one dollar. We were short ten dollars! \n\nTo have these three things happen all on the same night by the same server, and they all have to do with money... I mean, it has to really make you think. In our eyes, this was not a mistake anymore. She clearly deceived us. Definitely not a good thing. You can accidentally give us ranch dressing over blue cheese. Marinara sauce over Meat sauce. But to not state that there's an extra charge for a Caesar; to assume we wanted Kettle One; and to take an additional ten dollars from OUR money?!!!!  However way you want to look at it, it comes down to this, especially since we were the ones to have the unfortunate experience... Ashley was either told by the company to do this. Or she took it upon herself to take us for our money. Big mistake. \n\nI'll say this again - I did reach out to their Manager. Dominic did offer make things right. I don't know what that entails, but he seemed kind and professional. The experience was the worse we have ever had ANYWHERE. However, my kids like that old-school feel. So if we happen to take a trip to Vegas soon, maybe... just maybe we'll give it another shot. But after what happened, that's really a tough one. And if we do and all is 100% better, I'll revise this review, but until then, that was a terrible way to lose customers. Very deceiving. The thought is more like this, \"After what had happened, can we trust them?\"\n\nTo recommend this place would be wrong on my part to the reader. It's clearly spelled out for you, so this is an easy one. If you're looking for that special dinner to go to tonight or the weekend, regardless if you're a local or  visitor, I have to say it might be wise to do the extra homework and browse the many restaurants in Las Vegas and the surrounding areas. Like I said, we're not talking accidentally being served ranch over blue cheese... this is money. Money taken from us. Because of this, Capo's has lost our respect and trust. \n\nAnd so now as you're deciding, you have to remember: It's your money and it's always your choice."

That's what this stuff reminded me of. Italian food is not that difficult, yet so many places mess it up, and this place tops that list! $20 for a piece of lasagna that tasted like mush and was the size of cigarette pack. Hot ceasar salad with rock hard croutons and stale bread. The ambiance was horrible. I went with a party of six and they stuck us in a makeshift table in the isle next to the bar where everyone walking in or to the bathroom had to bump into us. The lighting is so bad that they have to put small lights on the menus. Some Sinatra wannabe singing so loud that I couldn't hear the people at my own table. The only bright spot was a well made Cherry Coke and a nice waitress who knew what a joke her work environment is. If you like the stereo typical wiseguy theme Italian restaurant, then this place is for you, right down to the secret entrance. You'll get a better bang for your buck at Fazolis so save yourself the heartache and skip this place, I wish I had..."

I feel like our waitress put us off to the side after she got sat with another party who probably didnt have a groupon. \nfood wise, this place was great! My boyfriend got the spaghetti and huge meatball and I got the penne a la vodka with chicken. We only go to a handful of Italuan spots in L.A. because we like authentic Italian. We will definitely be back for the food! The ambiance was really cool too! Red velvet and read leather, dark with small chandeliers. The entrance to this spot was a real treat, makes you feel like a mobster, especially after going to the mob attraction at the Tropicana, Fogetaboutit!\nDon't forget the calamari and red wine! \nOnly downside is that it is off the strip and getting a taxi is pricey! From the Tropicana to Capo's was $25 one way!"

I have always found the food to be great and this time everyone in a pretty decent sized party loved what  they ordered and, amazingly, got their dishes all at the same time. That was the first time this entire trip that there wasn't some issue with at least one order. Our waiter was a great kid and worked hard, and even the guys who helps him out bringing water etc was fantastic! The price for a large party was not bad at all considering we had paid almost exactly the same the night before for basic bar food.

            "review": "I think Capo's deserves a 2.5 because of originality, but since the stars won't allow, and due to a big-time let down and poor quality, I'll round down.\n\nMy Dad was in town for his 60th Birthday and he wanted Italian food for a less than outrageous price.  We can be pretty picky with Italian food considering we are Italian, and the fact that we come from where Italian food is actually good (NY,Philly,NJ).  He suggested Maggiano's because we know to expect good quality.  I didn't want to take him to a chain though, I wanted him to have something he could only get in Vegas, so I did my homework on Yelp, and Capo's seemed like the right choice.  A choice I ended up regretting.\n\nNo horror stories here, but as you will read, the service and food quality just weren't there, the only thing good was the atmosphere.\n\nUpon arrival the entry and speakeasy theme was pretty cool.  Would have been cooler without a sign that said credit cards were currently not accepted, cash only.  But still pretty cool.\nInside, the very dark environment with mafia decor and old Italian Resaurante style kept me looking around.  And an the old Vegas style lounge singer was belting out the Sinatra hits in a voice slightly better than my own (this is not a compliment to my voice).\n\nFrom here it just goes down hill.\n\nThere was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open, not being used.  I didn't realize we'd need a reso being it was a Tues night during the off-season and the place being in a hole in the wall off the beaten path.  Perhaps this was still my fault.\n\nThe service was bad.  Friendly enough, sure.  But we didn't get the water we asked for, and even after ordering we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.  Then the bread came, and had I not been starving, I would have tossed it in the garbage.  This was possibly the worst bread I have ever tasted.  Is it possible for bread to be that bad?  Apparently it is.  Not just bad, but terribly stale.  I gobbled up the chewy, stale loaf anyway because I was so hungry from waiting, nearly ripping out teeth in the process.\n\nThe main course eventually came and it was all sub-par.  Edible, yes.  In an Olive Garden quality kind of way, maybe a bit worse.  The fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the TV dinner box.  The added shrimp were a nice size.\n\nMy Dad got ravioli's in a red sauce with meatballs.  Again, just edible.  Especially since we were starving.  But a very generic taste all around.  I honestly felt embarrassed that I brought my Pop to eat this.\n\nThis is not a true Italian place.  It is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.  If you have ever had real Italian food, the taste of this food will be a total let down."

We had salad to start and the ceaser and house salads were soaked in salad dressing...way too much!  And be prepared for garlic, the salads were very garlicly, which I didn't mind.  I had the fish special that was encrusted in pine nuts.  It seemed more like a breadcrumb coating that I just pealed off.  For $35 I've had much better.  Someone ordered the The Chef Sleeps with Fishes which was good, but not oustanding.  If you're visiting LasVegas with a car and are intrigued by the 'theme\" then it's probably worth your while assuming the singer other reviewers wrote about is there.

We did not have a reservation and we were sat within 5 minute upon arrival.   While waiting I will add the maitre d was discussing how they were waiting for Anthony Bourdin to arrive...\nWe were sat and waited a good 10 minutes before being asked if we would like to order anything to drink.  when we finally ordered we were ready to finalize our entire meal order.  I ordered the calamari and linquini and clams.  my husband ordered the sausage ravioli .  \nWe were brought bread which I seriously thought looked and tasted like a crouton.  crunchy and dry.\nwhen the wines were served I was unhappily surprised and how small the glass of red was.  for 12 dollars you would think the glass would be served 1/2 full however it was filled 1/4 full and the white was 3/4 full.\nthe calamari came and it tasted frozen and heated through.  \nwe finished the calamari and waited at least 25 min until our entrees came.  i knew after my first bite of the linquini and clams the \"fresh pasta\" wasnt fresh, the clams were very very chewy and the sauce tasted like it had tons of sugar in it.  i have never tasted linquine and clams white sauce quite like this before.  my husbands ravolis tasted ok but again the sauce didnt taste fresh more like Hunts Spaghetti Sauce out of the can.\ni was looking forward to the bread pudding but after eating the entree i decided that if the appetizer and main were so bad i didnt think capos could recover with a good dessert so we decided to pass.\nwe live quite close to capos and and we decided to leave immediately following dinner.  my stomach was turning and I just wanted to get home.  not 2 minutes upon leaving did I tell my husband that i felt sick.  we were 1 block away from home and i made him pull over.  i could not hold it in , i tried but couldnt .  so with the overcooked possibly spoiled clams, not fresh made pasta, chewy calamari and old bread i had left on the pavement i am here at YELP making sure you all know how horrible my experience was.  I warn all to be very very careful here.   Anthony Bourdin will NOT be impressed!"

We understood that but when the food came to the table it was not split up so we asked for another plate and I split it myself.  We thought--that's good, we won't be charged the $5 now.  Not only were we charged for the split, we were charged $3 more ($8) for it, because \"they recently raised the price\" (but didn't update the menu?).  On top of that we ordered the spaghetti Santucci which was good, but we thought the meatballs were included as one of the choices in the dish.  They added another $5 on for the meatballs too.

After confirming the reservation, you are let into a dimly let restaurant where the decor is clean, cool, and old school (with pictures of mobsters hanging up). The music was calm and easy, and by midway through the meal we had a live singer going around the tables. He was awesome. \n\nAs for the food: absolutely amazing. I'm a vegetarian and was very happy with the selection. We started with the fried ricotta rivoli and had the soup (pasta fagioli, much like minestrone) or salad that came with our entrees. I then got the rigatoni trafficante (minus the prosciutto) and my friend got the shrimp alfredo. Everything was so delicious and clearly homemade.

Instead there was a man singing to a karaoke machine with Sinatra CD's.  There was a magician going table to table but he did not visit our table.   However, the food is mediocre at best.  The fried ravioli was obviously frozen then dropped in a fryer.  It was mushy and tasteless.  The salads were fine.  Romaine lettuce seemed fresh and dressing was fine.  It tasted over seasoned, but we could not identify the spice over used.  Basil???   I ordered the fetticcine  Alfredo with grilled chicken and it was awful.  The chicken was NOT grilled.  I'm pretty sure it was frozen, precooked chicken chunks.  The sauce was awful and did not taste fresh.  Husband had the lasagna and said it was not good.  He ate a little then said, \"It's not even worth finishing\".  Everything was over seasoned as if they use bottled sauce and just add seasoning to make it taste \"better.\"  We did not bother with dessert.  So disappointing because it was NOT cheap.  The theme is really neat that's it.  Not fresh, not good, not tasty."

We said okay fine, we'll be back. \nWe went back an hour later, same guy opened the door and asked if we had a reservation. We said no. He said he has no room for us and we can just go and sit at the bar. He did a really offensive gesture and then walked off. \n\nStill standing there in shock, like umm did that really just happen.\nWe decided not to sit at the bar. Especially since we didn't know where the bar was, it's so dark you can't see anything in there.  We couldn't even see how to get out, so we had to wait for him to come back. When he finally did come back, we asked him why he didn't let us know we needed a reservation when we were there an hour earlier. He said 'now you know' and left.\n\nI'm glad I didn't eat there. Ridiculous!"

            "review": "An Italian restaurant that feels like an old speakeasy. The ambience is unique with a secret entrance & a live Sinatra like performer who will sing at your table. There is the occasional magician or lady selling roses too. \n\nThe service follows the old speakeasy feel. Reservations are recommended, otherwise try to grab a seat at the bar (which can be hard to come by). When you call to make a reservation you'll get an abrupt \"yeah, \" making it feel like you're part of a secret Italian meeting. You'll get the same \"what do you want attitude\" when you come in the front door. It's all part of the appeal to the restaurant. Once you get your table, the servers are attentive & the food arrives in a timely fashion. There is a view of the kitchen from some of the seating at the bar and booths. Further inside, you get a view of the Sinatra-like performer. There's also room room for larger parties. \n\nThe food quality here is great. I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, but everything here is really good. Ma's meatballs is two huge meatballs served with sauce and peppers that add a nice spice. The lasagna portion is gigantic & my fave. The chicken parmigiana and chicken Marsala are tasty traditional choices, but I would recommend trying something more original like the chicken Anastasia. For dessert the turtle cheesecake hits the spot. \n\nThe prices are $20-$30 for dinner, but the portions are huge so you'll likely have leftovers. If you get an appetizer, consider sharing an entree. They also have 2for1 Tuesdays to offset cost. I haven't been for lunch, but it looks like you can get a sandwich for $10, so not bad. I'd like to try the meatball sandwich someday!"

My pasta was delicious with lots of different italian toppings. Calamari plate itself would be good for 4 people. My boyfriend & I's bill was also good enough for 4 people (or more) LOL. The bread's butter is the best butter ever. It's like a honey butter. Also, beware of strong alcoholic drinks! I recommend this place if its anything like the old venue (Tropicana & Jones).

I have heard many a story so off we went. \n\n   I found from other reviews that reservation are a sure fire way to go. so I made our reservations and got the password. Others had stated that with out a reservation there visit was not as enjoyable as it should have been. So off we went with password and info in hand..\n\n  When you get there its just a rectangle building nothing fancy, and you really don't have to hunt for the door its pretty easy to spot. Once you enter the whole mob atmosphere is in full play. Dark mysterious and a bit unknown. I wont go into to much here as its an experience in itself, But ring the bell and wait...\n\n    Once your inside, its a very lively place.. you enter by the bar and its all old school inside. and the matradee takes you to your table. Now had I known there where 2 rooms I would have requested the main room when placing my reservation. The back room is small and you can not see much if anything that is going on int he main area. Its also seems to be where the place you if you brought your kids..( which I do not recommend ). And it is right by the entrance to the kitchen so a bit busy and noisy. But it does have its own charm. \n\n   All the chairs and booths are covered in red velvet, which was a nice touch. The music is mostly from a live singer who is doing all the Sinatra hits for the era. We could hear him but not see him as he walks around and sings. \n\n   Now I had heard some really bad things about service, so I was prepared. We sat for a what seemed about 10 min with no one addressing us, I was hmmmm, but then a waiter came to the table and got our drink orders and appetizers. Did mention its dark in there? they give you little flash lights to read the menu by.. Thought is was different. The rest of the night waiter service was excellent. Never had to ask for anything. So slow start but nice recovery.\n\n   They bring you out bread service, which is nice portion of a fresh sourdough. Or apps and salads where out in a rather timely fashion and where outstanding. I recommend the garlic bread and sauce, I don't know how they make the sauce but it was one of the best I have tasted in a long time. Our meals arrived to the table timed perfectly. The portions are large but not over bearing the plate. plenty to take home. Food was hot, plenty of sauce and delicious. Again the lasagna was fantastic and if you order a meatball its about the size of a softball..  Its a meal by itself.\n\n    We where asked if we would like any desert and we passed as there just was no more room. we where not hurried at that point either. we finished our drinks and chatted a bit and then decided to head out. as we got up from our table we where thanked for coming in and we made our way to the main room. at this point we where escorted to the exit. Much like you would have been in the day. you exit through side doors to the parking lot. As we where leaving we took a few minutes and just looked around the room..  lots of old photos and posters.. you really get the feel that the Mob bosses may have been in a corner booth conducting business.. \n\n     I highly recommend you give it a try, if nothing else just for the experience. And don't forget the password!! the guy at the door doesn't like that.."

The salads that came with the meal were tiny. \n\nGuess you are paying for the speakeasy theme because the prices they charge are way too high for what they give you,  plus you are forced to order way overpriced drinks to get the 2-for -1 deal.

We found the secret entrance, gave the eyes in the doorway the code and were granted admission. The entire place is dimly lit and mob like. Red lights flash to alert them of new visitors and creaky wood floors keep people honest. We were seated right away, in a comfy booth adorned with a portrait of Al Capone. \n\nAll the waiters wear white pressed long sleeve shirts and black trousers with suspenders. I selected the meatball sandwich, which came with a side salad. The sandwich was amazing. The best Italian I have ever had in my life. The creamy garlic dressing is so good, you will wish you could take a bottle home with you. From the drink list, I chose \"Kick in the Head\". We visited a nearby tiki bar a bit later and let me tell you -Capo's crafts a much better cocktail. It was delicious and carried just the right punch. \n\nMy man selected the chipped Italian beef sandwich and again, we were blown away. It's as if they have taken good home cooking and elevated it to off the charts good. Their Chianti selection is also excellent.

I'd love it if Yelp had half stars because I think our experience was actually a 3.5.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant cannot be beat.  I've been to the Flamingo location many times and have always loved it.  I was happy to see that the decor and general atmosphere of the restaurant was very similar.  After being seated, our server took a while to take our order, but she was super friendly.  We ordered the antipasto appetizer, which is basically a salad, but an AMAZING salad!!  It was delicious.  Only problem was that salad came with our entrees as well.  Anyway, the antipasto salad was awesome.  Then our dinner salads came, both with blue cheese dressing, and they were pretty disappointing.  They lettuce was completely swimming in dressing and I didn't have more than a couple bites.  Maybe next time I will ask for dressing on the side.\n\nMy date ordered the ravioli trafficanti, and I ordered the rigatoni with arrabiatta and a meatball.  His dish was delicious!!!  Unfortunately, we were super full already at that point from bread and salad, we only ate one of the giant ricotta stuffed raviolis.  My dish was...just ok.  It wasn't bad, but there was absolutely NO wow factor.  The meatball was not GREAT, but definitely good.  The dish just looked and tasted like something I could make at home with boxed rigatoni and Prego sauce, and throw in some chili peppers.  Voila!  Next time, I will have to remember to order something more complicated.  I would say over all, the food was a 4.\n\nService.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but our server seemed to be running around like she was completely swamped.  She may have checked on us only once throughout our entire meal.  Before our entrees came, we ordered wine so that we could have it with dinner, but our entrees came and we ate them and our server finally came back and said the bar was backed up and our drinks would be coming soon.  We just told her to cancel them because we were done eating!  I looked at the bar and there were 3 people sitting at it and the bartender just putting glasses away and chatting with the barback.  Then she took forever to bring us our check, and to take it after we put our credit card in it.  Overall, the service kind of sucked.  That would be a 3.\n\nSo I'd give the restaurant in general a 3.5, but since we can't, sorry Capo's, I have to round down because it definitely was not a 4-star experience.  I've always loved this restaurant because of it's unique experience with the entry way, the Sinatra-like singer, and the ambiance, but this time was mildly disappointing.  I'd go back, but not anytime soon and it won't be on the top of my list."

He made our exit by stopping into our private room and singing a little bit for us which was pretty cool. This restaurant is very dark and speakeasy. Drinks are really good and the food, even better. The meatballs are HUGE and delicious! I ordered the pesto. No one complained about their dish, only that they were full. The only thing we didn't think of was he leftovers and portions. Since we were catching a show, we were unable to take any leftovers with us which was kind of a bummer since the portions are pretty family style.

I nearly broke my neck on the way to the private room. I hadn't even had a drink yet lol so it wasn't the booze. I was wearing very short heels and I stepped on a slippery section of wood taking me for a slip and slide. I caught myself so I didn't fall, but I skated past a table having dinner which was pretty embarrassing. My friend had the same thing happen to her but she was able to side-step it before sliding.

And yes, it is as creepy as the strip mall the restaurant is located in.\n\nWe came in at about 5:30 on a Sunday and the place was pretty quiet, but we were told that there were no tables available, only spaces at the bar. No problem, we took the bar. The bartender/waitress was extremely attentive and pleasant and honestly, she was probably the high point of the experience - she was awesome. \n\nThe food is good but I have had better. We both ordered chicken parmigiana, and it was exactly what you want when looking for chicken parmigiana but priced higher. You can select your side dish from a few pre-set choices - I went safe for the spagetti on the side which was yummy, my boyfriend ordered mashed potatoes on the side (which, of course, I sampled - those were also good). \n\nThe prices are a little steep for sitting at the bar and what you get, but the vibe is cool - very old school Mob. Note the chalk outline on the floor as you walk out."

Capo's did not disappoint!\n\nOne note: it's a $50 cab ride from the Strip ($25 each way), but it was worth it, as the cost for a full dinner and drinks was about half what you'd pay in Strip restaurants.\n\nThis place is a hoot -- you have to ring a bell and then you're asked for a password to be let in (like the old Speakeasy's - very fun)\nThe restaurant is VERY dark, especially coming from the Vegas sun -- it's dark and very cozy with lots of half-booths. The d\u00e9cor is fun, photos of gangsters and Sinatra's mugshot.\n\nThere is a singer doing lounge songs, and he's pretty good!\nOur waiter, Bruce, was great -- his personality fit the place perfectly. He gave us recommendations for dinner and wine.\n\nFor appetizer, we went with the bruschetta, which was very good. The bread was thin and toasty/crunchy and absorbed the yummy tomato topping, it was very light.\n\nFor dinner, hubby got the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta -- the sauce was tasty, but the shrimp were over-cooked which was sad because the pasta was perfect.\n\nI went with the recommendation of the chicken marsala with mushroom risotto -- it was just excellent and so delicious, a great combo together. The chicken was so tender you could cut with a fork and the marsala was thick and full of flavor. The risotto was a perfect match.\n\nI am an Italian from Boston and I have not had a better Italian meal in the North End.\n\nAs we had ordered our apps, Hubby said \"I know that waiter, we have seen him before\" and then we realized that he had served us at the Range at Harrah's a few years back -- he had a personality that leaves a positive impression. We asked him and sure enough it was the same guy! He was thrilled that we had remembered him, he spent a few minutes telling us about what happened with the Range and how he ended up at Capo's. What a sweet guy, so genuine - he said he was so happy that we remembered him and you could tell he really meant it.\n\nWhat a great experience - we will be back.\n\nThe only reason it's not 5 star is because of the over-cooked shrimp, other than that it was spot-on perfect!"

You need the word of the day to get through the speakeasy style doors. Once in there is a guy crooning Italian songs and an amazing card trick guy that visits your table. We were lucky enough to be placed in the \"movie room\" where Godfather was playing and posters of the movie adorned the walls. The food was AWESOME/ be sure to get the meatball appetizers.

When you first walk in, you're in a small room where you need to ring a buzzer to get in. A host opens a opens a small hatch to see who you are, then opens a hidden door behind the pay phone to let you in. We thought this was pretty neat because it gave it a real speakeasy feel to it. \n\nYou walk through the hidden door and you'r in the restaurant. The lights are kept very dim, which adds to the mystic of the place. After allowing our eyes to adjust, you'll see old mob photos on the wall and the chefs cooking in the open kitchen next to the bar. \n\nThe level of cheese elevated to a whole new level when we saw the music was coming from a gentleman singing from his karaoke set up. I can't make this up. He appeared to be a regular \"attraction\" because all the staff knew him. At one point his CD started skipping while he was singing \"Quando, Quando, Quando\". I told my wife he must be singing the remix version! He started the song over. I can only assume because he didn't want his artistic integrity compromised. This amused me on so many levels... who hires a karaoke singer as their entertainment? And more importantly... who uses CD's anymore???\n\nOnce we were seated at our table, the staff seemed very responsive and courteous. They did a good job of keeping our glasses full of water and clearing plates as we emptied them. The quality of food left a lot to be desired. The marinara sauce on my wife's pasta was cold, the picatta sauce was just so-so. The real laugher came with the side of risotto. Rather than taking the time needed to properly make it using arborio rice and slow cooking it, they steamed long-grain white rice, added some cheese and mushrooms, and called it \"risotto\". \n\nIf you're looking for good Italian food, I'd rate this place somewhere below Sbarro's. If you're looking for a novelty restaurant with a so-so mob theme, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, save yourself the drive."

I went to order an item I saw off the online menu and the waitress told me they took that item off the menu 8 years ago. Really? They couldn't update their menu. It would take 5 minutes. I settled for the lasagna and I would say stouffer's is better. Our bill came to $103. My cocktail the size of a shot was $10. They charge strip prices with a Denny's quality type of food.

What a great experience (Capo's, not the fight).  \n\nWe had a reservation and were seated quickly after arrival, once we made past the door keeper.  That, in and of itself, is a trip!  We were given menus and water promptly.  The menus were thoughtfully provided with small flashlights to make reading them easier in the subdued lighting.  Overall the ambiance  is pleasant and the staff knowledgable, personable, and attuned to the needs of their guests.  The place does tend to get a bit noisy what with a vocalist performing and dozens of tables filled with happy diners so if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner you would be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for exceptional service, exceptional food, and exceptional entertainment, you won't find any better in Southern Nevada.  My girlfriend's husband had Shrimp Scampi, she had Chicken Picata with Garlic Risotto, my wife had Spaghetti with Meatball (it's a HUGE meatball), and I had Lasagna with Crumbled Meatball.  Every dish we were served was abundant and fabulous.  \n\nAs for the entertainment, the vocalist is a nice touch.  He performed well and visited several tables while singing.  And the magician, well he is an absolute WOW!  He performs table side and mystifies.  I named a playing card at random (the eight of diamonds) and it magically appeared out of the deck.  He handed it to me along with a Sharpie (which we all sniffed) and I signed it.  He then proceeded to amaze us all by having the card move through the deck, apparently at his will.  He also did things with coins and table settings that had the four of us just shaking our heads in wonder.  \n\nSo here is the bottom line on this place; if you are looking for a fine dining experience with peaceful, calm surroundings, pass this place by.  However, if what you are seeking is a dining experience encompassing great Italian food prepared like mama would fix it and served by attentive staff, an atmosphere where everyone is enjoying life and entertainment that by far exceeds the price paid for the meal alone, then you best get to Capo's sooner rather than later!"

Capo's has come up with a way to distinguish their \"mobster\" theme.  Guests arrive to an empty foyer with little besides a pay phone and a few framed pictures on the wall.  What is this?  You follow the directions and ring a bell, whereupon a secret hatch opens up and a Jersey-accented thug asks what we want.  After a little back-and-forth the wall holding the pay phone opens to a dimly-lit wonderland of mobster memorabilia.  It's lots of fun!  Walking past the kitchen you see the staff busily preparing the food.  This is pretty much the last you will see of the food at Capo's.\n\nThe atmosphere is super fun and the food was tasty too.  I would probably have given them more stars if I could have been able to see what I was eating.  The menus arrive with tiny lights attached to aid in actually reading them.  All around the dining room other patrons are using their cell-phones to catch a glimpse of what they are eating.  There is no reason for this place to be so dark.  Part of the culinary experience for me is to look at the presentation and I completely missed out on it at Capo's.  \n\nThe food and the concept are great!

When we got dropped off by the cab, we weren't so sure of our choice just based on the exterior of the building, and when we walked in the entrance, we were even less so. This is designed just like an old speakeasy. When you enter the door, it appears to be a dark closet with a keypad to punch in a secret code to enter. As we were puzzling over the keypad, a little hidden look-through panel popped open and the host greeted us (to our startled surprise!). He then opened a hidden door. When we stepped into the door, we walked into the 1920s!  It was amazing!\n\nThe atmosphere felt authentic with the exception of the large screen LCD where \"Good Fellas\" was playing. The walls were decorated with old gangsters and a very good singer was strolling the restaurant singing old Rat Pack songs.\n\nThe food was just as good as the atmosphere!

Highly recommend coming here if you're visiting ~ or if you're local.  This was my and my BFs first time to Vegas and to Capos. We had a great time!!  On a personal note , I would have paid someone to turn off the TVs.  We are All guilty of looking at flashing screens and it would have been perfect if when my BF and I sat at the bar he wasn't tempted to check the score (which he did... And then forgot to converse with me ). Just a preference! It seems we can't escape screens in this day and age and I was just so looking forward to a night of just his full attention haha.  Overall - when Rob and I come back to Vegas we will definitely be visiting you all again and enjoying every bit! Thank you!"

Let's just say that it was a good type of disturbed.\nChicago Mafia-Style all the way. You get screened prior to entering in a rather fun kind of way.\nOnce seated it was hard to admire the appointments. I'm telling you it was so dark that they literally have flashlights tied to the menus so that you can read them. That was kind of cool and romantic since I was trying to be all cuddly with my sweetie (for the night anyway). LOL\nBack to the review.\nI ordered the pecan crusted Chilean Sea Bass. It was the best that I've ever had. Who'd of thought that that far away from the ocean would be the best cut of bass one can find? It was LARGE too. The service was spectacular. The entertainment had a old school Italian feel as the singer was walking around engaging the customers while dining. It was a very cool experience.\nSo, if you're in Vegas and want to get off of the beaten path and away from the colon locking buffets.. Try this place out and be amazed!"

Being a regular, I can say that this is, hands & feet down one of the coolest Vegas flair restaurants, unique in its kind & kick a$$ at the same time.\n\nCapo's is the only speakeasy in Las Vegas.  Call for reservations & prepare to go back in time when Alphonse Gabriel aka: \"Al\" Capone hung out in an underground bar during the prohibition era of the 1920's & 1930's.\n\nFood is pretty decent for Italian cuisine, not the best I've ever had.  But you don't necessarily go to Capo's for the food, ha, you go for the environment.  Most servers come fully equipped with some sort of East Coast accent.  But provide attentive and hospitable service.\n\nMost nights a live lounge singer will serenade you table-side to good ole favs from Ol' Blue Eyes.  Don't make direct eye-contact if you don't want him to embarrass the sheeze outta ya.  Once he sang me, \"that ladies a tramp\" ha, thanks! \n\nCorner location, not many people know of this little treasure, good for me, I bring all my out of town guests here.  They eat it up.\n\nThe decor is awesome, dimly lite & romantic-ish, and the bar almost always plays the movie Godfather.....or a mafia gangster movie. \nThere's also a hidden cigar bar upstairs, ask your server for details. It's super small & quite ventilation retard, but cool nonetheless.\n\nGO, go at least once a week!"

Food sat under the heating lamp for 20 minutes before someone finally delivered it. We were there far longer than we needed to be waiting for service and missed a planned event because of it. (No, they weren't that busy) Trying to get in was fun but we were not put in the room showing on the website. It was a side room that wasn't very nice. And if its so authentic why don't they have authentic SWEET Italian sausage. Why is that so hard to find in the west?

Here is our experience....\nWe walk into a small foyer with locked doors and a doorbell for entrance, this is at 6 PM on Wednesday. A small wizard of oz \"face door\" opens with a guy asking is we have reservations, we tell him no, he offers us to come in if we agree to sit at the bar, we were ok with that. I'm thinking \"are they going for an Italian Mafia impression? Cuz, it's working!!\" We sit at a nice big bar, in a place that was at least 90% empty --- REALLY? And a reservation is necessary for a table or booth? \n\nBartender takes our drink orders and delivers the menus. The place is so dark, the menus have a keychain flashlight attached to them. The Caesar salad was limp, greasy and pretty flavorless. The pasta e figioli soup had a nice flavor, but the pur\u00e9e texture was kinda weird, I prefer a broth and chunky texture. \n\nMy friend ordered the \"sleeps with fish\" specialty pasta dish, and she said it was VERY good. I ordered the vodka specialty pasta with blackened chicken, the pasta \"pink\" sauce was really flavorful and I really enjoyed the sun-dried tomatoes. The blackened chicken was extremely salty. The bread served with the meal was really good.\n\nThe bartender/waitress asked us to give her our honest impression of the things we had, so we told her.... Before long, the manager came over and apologized and offered to remove the extra charges for the blackened chicken and the Caesar salad \"upgrades\", which was very nice of him. (I think that was the same \"face\" that opened the little wizard of oz door when we got there).\n\nThe bill arrives and my friend pays with her credit card. There isn't a keychain flashlight on the bill, and with the lights so low, my friend misread the total as being $20 more than it actually was (we noticed her copy later in the evening in \"light\").... I am quite curious to see if they ran her card for the actual tip amount she posted or the wrong total and take the $40+ tip, instead of the $20+ tip that was intended. \n\nI may end up adjusting my rating accordingly when I find out if they are honest or not."

I'd say this is more for adults than kids, though. Dinner prices are a bit on the high side, but they occasionally come up on Groupon.\n\nCAPO'S HOUSE  SALAD or NICO'S CAESAR SALAD ($7): Overpriced and overdressed, they use tons of dressing, but do taste good. Opt for the garlic version on the House, splurge the extra $3 to add chicken to the Caesar.\nAUNTIE G'S ANTIPASTO SANDWICH ($12): Chicken breast and various antipasto meats and cheeses layered on a tasty focaccia with roasted red peppers, spinach, and a delightful lemon-pesto aioli. Side choice of pasta salad or fries, topped with additional aioli. Large portion, very fresh.\nSANTUCCI'S PASTA ($10): classic spaghetti with \"Capone family secret sauce\", add a giant meatball for $5 to make it a real meal. Pasta was a bit mushy but the 'ball was pretty good, BF said he'd get this again.\n\nFood quality for lunch was probably a 3/5 but attentive service and atmosphere kicks the overall rating up to a 4 for me. Would come back in the evening for the Frank Sinatra singer, or to catch HH at the bar (3-6PM, M-Sat). They have a private dining room for larger parties.

That's why I ordered the Chicago Beef. Such a bum-mer. The sandwich one wasn't dipped in the au jus.

Not sure what the \"admittance\" process is suppose to be, but it did not live up to the hype of the previous reviews. Once we were seated (in the back by the kitchen), we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat and to contemplate the meaning of life.  It seemed that we and the 3 other surrounding tables were be handled by 2 different servers but they did not seem to communicate with each other.  Service was spotty at best. The male server was amazing at saying he would bring the items we were missing but then forget. He was like the guy on 50 First Dates whose memory would reset after 10 seconds.  Then after waiting for the female server to come back we would get our items promptly. \n\nFood:  The cheap knock off version of what people think Italian good should taste like.  I ordered Santucci's Pasta with a huge meatball and my husband ordered Da Don's Lasagna.  My paste seemed slightly undercooked and the sauce and meatball had a strange flavor. It was nothing special.  My husbands lasagna was ok but they use the same sauce as my spaghetti.  That would have been fine if the sauce had been good, but it definitely was not. \n\nEntertainment:  There's not a whole lot that I can say about it since we could not see it from where we were seated. I will say that while we couldn't see it, we could definitely hear it.  The male singers voice was blaring over the speakers. It was so loud that my husband and I could not talk without yelling at each other.  This probably would not have been an issue had we been able to see what was going on.  This ended up annoying us more than anything. We were happy when he finally decided to take a break.  They went to canned CD music which was perfect because it wasn't as loud.\n\nPrice:  The best way I can describe this is they charge Friday night A team stripper price for the Tuesday afternoon C team.\n\nOverall my husband and I will not be back. There is better food and entertainment in Vegas for less money."

Really a great environment, decorated so perfectly for the 1920's speakeasy theme.  Made me want to pull out my flapper dress for our next visit. The food was great - creamy garlic salad dressing was heavenly - good tomato-based soup - ravioli, pesto linguine, and alfredo pastas all excellent and the meatball was great!  Big portions - no room for dessert. Good entertainment- singer and magician both wonderful.  What a fun, entertaining and delicious dining experience.  Expect us back again!"

I won't give it up here but it's worth at least getting a drink to experience that part.\n\nGreeter was great.\n\nLounge singer was very 70s and campy, but liked him none the less.\n\n\nFood is pretty below average in pretty much every way possible.\n\nBread they bring out is pretty bad and dries out within minutes of being at the table to the point it's inedible.\n\nSalads were small, boring and WAY drowned in dressing.\n\nCalamari is $15 or so, and is half the size of what they'd give you at Capitol Grille, and is pretty bland and mushy.\n\nthe pasta tasted as though it were cooked in rancid water.  the chef was nice enough to come out and bring my wife a personalized dish that he eats, and it tasted the same.  we smiled and pretended to enjoy it just to keep from looking like big complainers.  We literally don't complain usually, but her first dish was inedible.\n\nMy lasagna was decent, but nothing spectacular and the sauce was too sweet (but that's a matter of taste, so i digress.)\n\nDesert: It was spectacular.  Try the tiramisu, it is the best I've ever had.  Canolis were great too.  Loved it.\n\nOur server was new, and he told us as such, so he was pretty clueless overall, but very nice as well.\n\nBus boys were very attentive.\n\nService overall was above average but the food was just so mediocre I can't think of a reason to talk myself into visiting again.\n\nIf you go, get a drink, maybe an app, and head somewhere else for a good italian dinner.  For God's sake, Maggianos (a chain) kills this place at the same price point.  You're better of there or Macaroni Grill truthfully."

I expected a lunch menu pricing.  NOPE! Fugettaboutit! Nothing less than $8.95 for a burger.   I paid $10.95 for what was supposed to be meat/sausage lasagna and I expected a fairly good portion.  What I got was a small square 3x3 in of cheezy layers of noodles swimming in sauce. Very little meat, NO bread, no garlic knots... nothing.  \nI ordered take out, but really I felt it was way over priced for what I got.  Should have been offered bread to sop up the sauce and to stretch out the meal, cuz I sure didn't get enough food.  \nWon't be going back!"

Every waiter was polite, very attentive and quick. Drinks were refilled constantly, questions were answered politely & the waiters all constantly had a smile on their faces! The food was so amazing, I ate every bite. I ordered the ricotta traficante (don't recall the exact name) but it was amazing! The food was so fresh and seasoning was just right. At the end of the night the waiters brought our to go boxes and, came to the table to wish me a happy birthday and a desert on the house.

            "review": "The ambiance in this place can't be beat if you're looking for a classic Vegas speakeasy-type of old-world Italian charm. The food - as long as you stick to what they do best - is pretty darn good too, making this place worth the trip up Sahara.  The service was really spot-on too.  We had early 5:00pm reservations on a Saturday night for six people and there were plenty of attentive staff members to attend to our every need.\n\nThere were unfortunately a few shortfalls.  One was with the Chilean Sea Bass which was a special of the evening.  Ordering seafood at an Italian restaurant with no fish at all on the menu probably isn't a good idea, and this proved to be the case here.  Luckily I wasn't the one who ordered it and the person in our group who did wasn't as familiar with the plate.  She didn't seem to mind the fishy smell and taste which ordinarily wouldn't accompany a fresh version of this dish, but the bite I had was not good.  Wasn't prepared poorly, just wasn't fresh or of high quality, particularly for the price.  Minus one star.\n\nThe rest of the food, though also somewhat pricy, was delicious.  Pasta, a signature chicken dish and even a Ribeye steak were all wonderful.  The meatball appetizer consisting of two baseball-sized meatballs in a spicy pepper sauce was a real star of the show.  Stuffed mushrooms were good too, but also a bit on the spicy side.  If you're not a lover of zing, watch for things on the menu noted as spicy - they're not lying.\n\nFor larger parties of six or more, they are supposed to include an 18% gratuity as explained on the menu.  Parties of either 8 or 10 or more (can't recall which) have a 20% gratuity tacked on.  I don't have a problem with this and it's clearly noted on the back of the menu, but it seems the staff does have a problem with it.  When our check came there was a 20% gratuity added onto it, even though we only had 6 people at the table.  To add insult to injury, they figured the 20% gratuity on the POST-TAX amount.  Those two screw-jobs added up to quite a bit since the pre-tax total was already over $300.00, so minus another star.\n\nWe were in a rush and truthfully I would have added more onto the pre-tax 18% I was expecting anyway because the service was truly fantastic, but I would have rather done so myself.  Instead, our nice meal ended with me feeling as if I'd just been screwed because they can't follow their own rules.  C'mon Capo's - do the right thing.  Figure the percentages properly and apply them appropriately to the pre-tax amount.  The extra couple of dollars isn't worth the bad taste left in the mouth of any diner paying for a party of six or more who can do basic math.  \n\nAnd if you're reading this and going there with a party of six or more, keep the calculator handy and make sure you're treated fairly.  Maybe it was just our server using these kinds of underhanded, deceitful methods of figuring out gratuities, but I'll never know because next time I have six or more in our party, I'll go somewhere else."

The workers were extremely rude & then we asked to speak to the manager. He would not accept the groupon because it said it was for four ppl but the other couple canceled last minute. The groupon for 2 people cost less money but we wanted to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal but the manger refused.\n\nSo let me get this straight.....you're telling me you don't want our business? Especially since we told you we'd like to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal? Why does it matter how many ppl are dining if we just told you we'd like to spend so much more money?  RIDICULOUS\n\nOn top of that he tried to swindle us into paying waaaay more if we wanted to stay & dine. He was the rudest manager I've ever met in my life. He had an attitude the entire time & was extremely unfriendly. He basically said its our fault that we can't follow the rules.\n\nIt's ironic that I'm writing such a negative review because we initially decided to eat here after reading the positive reviews on yelp....but this was by far an awful experience.\n\nAfter we left we went to Craftsteak in MGM GRAND & spent 3 times as much because we knew we'd get better service & the best food guaranteed."

The food is one of the better tasting Italian restaurants in Las Vegas, and the dark speakeasy ambiance makes the place feel fun and romantic.  The live performer singing Rat Pack tunes is a nice touch but on occasion I felt it made it difficult to talk to the person next to you.   \n\nI recommend this place for a date, but I recently learned DO NOT take a large group.  We had a party of about 13 people and went during a night that offered buy one entr\u00e9e and get the other free promotion.  So most of our group consisted of couples expecting to pay for only one of their entr\u00e9es.  The bill came and they said they do not split checks, and will only accept two credit cards at most.  Then when we read the check we found the buy one entr\u00e9e get one free applied to the whole check . So, if a couple got cheap pastas and a couple got expensive steaks then both pastas were taken off but the more expensive meals were left on the bill. I feel this is why they refused to split the checks, so they could nickel and dime us on the promotion.  This caused complete chaos trying to figure out who paid what on the bill. Also, they tacked a large group gratuity (which is not unexpected) but it was over the 20% they claimed. To make matters worse the required gratuity was hand written on the bill with a pen.  Sorry I don't feel I should pay anything that is hand written on a typed bill. After waiting an HOUR and generally getting the run around they explained it was on the pre-discounted bill which though there was a pre-discounted line on the bill somehow that didn't include everything and they had to print another larger bill to prove gratuity was correct.  I don't disagree that in the end the gratuity was 18% however, the whole thing seemed so sketchy .  We reluctantly paid everything and will never bring a large group back. This is 2015, I bet your computer can split a check, it comes down to laziness and frankly trying to get a couple extra bucks on your promotion.  Apparently the speakeasy ambiance includes feeling like I just got shakedown by the mob.\n\nEven if you exclude the promotion that caused a majority of confusion at our dinner. The fact they do not split checks is a major knock on this place for large groups. Because no event is fun when it ends with calculators trying to split the bill."

We had reservations and when we arrived we got placed into a huge plush red side both in one of the corners. Note however it is dark in here almost \"I can't see\" kind of dark. So if you are sleepy maybe don't go cause you could fall asleep. While eatting we enjoyed the sing styles of a Frank Sinatra wanna be who was not at all bad. He was interacting with the diners even singing happy Birthday.\n\nThis place is pretty cool. We all had a good time and did not have trouble finding something to eat. I choose the Trafficante Rigatoni and a raspberry/ lemon martini thing. Both were very good. They use real oils and top notch ingredients. This is not your local Noodles and Co. \n\nBut with that said this place is on the pricey side. For my dish and my drink it put me back $25.00. Altogether for our party of 5 it put use back $137.00. So be prepared for that. When we finished we took a few pictures with the chalk drawings and the old school car outside. \n\nOverall we had a great dinner and a good experience. I would go here again after saving up some babysitting money."

But you can barely tell when you get inside.\n\nIt is very dark inside, very swanky. I loved it because it was romantic. I wish they had real candles on the table, but maybe that is a city ordinance or because it would make the restaurant hotter than it already was. The kitchen is open (hooters give away number 2) so I think  that is what heats up the place. \n\nThe menu's come with cute little flashlights so you can read in the dimly lit room, which i thought was a nice touch.\n\nI ordered a pellegrino, I was expecting the bottle to be chilled but it wasn't. I didn't complain though. \n\nOur waitress was a sweetheart and very attentive.  \n\nI ordered the Clams and Linguini in a White Sauce - I believe it is called \"The gallows with clams\" - It was alright, kind of soupy with no real flavor..nothing I would write home about.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the \"Sawed off sausage\" but took it back. Not really any sauce and the sausage was just a little too spicy and he already had heartburn. He then ordered the \"Al Capone Carbonara\" - He said it lacked flavor, but once he added a little salt to it, he enjoyed it a bit more. \n\nSo dinner was \"Meh\" to say the least.\n\nWe ordered the \"Cannoli\" for dessert and that was fantastic! SOOOO delicious.\n\nSo like I said we would come back for the experience and the Cannoli.. but thats about it. A little too expensive for the quality of food you actually get.\n\nHave fun!"

It has  a old school hide out feel from when you just walk up to the entrance. The food has always been good here and if you catch it on a nice weekend night usually they have Bobby singing old dean martin, frank Sinatra songs. Hes very good. Definitely check out the one on Tropicana."

Extremely poorly lit and that's the point so I thought that was kind of neat (especially that they were smart enough to put a little light on each menu). The food though is absolutely to die for! The waitress was super nice to me and my date and her suggestions were perfect. I've never had a meatball that amazing and those noodles were so perfectly cooked it was almost scary. They even had a Sinatra singer in there (though the music was a bit loud by him) who was actually really great. All around not a single complaint! Oh and it was 2 for 1 Tuesday so we got $20 off (that was almost my entire entree, $22)! Fantastic, just fantastic."

My husband tried to get my attention off the topic , but it still was in the back of mind. \n   On the bright side with a few glasses of Riesling I was able to get over it . Upon our arrival I was surprised by the speakeasy entrance where I focused my eyes on the door I was sure was to secretly open, was actually on the opposite side. This greeting is a fun goodfellas type greeting in a secret corridor. \nFor starters my hubby and I both had a salad -his with house vinaigrette and I chose the bleu cheese. He was quite pleased but mine was drenched in the bleu cheese. Blech! I don't like my salad drowning in the dressing. \nFor dinner we both chose the Scarface shrimp scampi . On the plus side the shrimp was plump and generous in size. \nThe linguine was flavored with a small amount of scampi seasoning , tomatoes and garlic. The flavor was good but it was as if the chef dumped the linguine out and didn't toss the seasoning all the way through. I can eat some pasta but this was like a bland pile of linguine for $25 a plate , I expected more. \nThe ambiance was warm and relaxing. On Fridays they have a frank Sinatra crooner singing old blue eyes remakes. On my previous visits they would be playing old mobster movies but this time it was showing a basketball game. \nThe best thing to make up for my downer of dinner was the dessert! Chocolate cannoli's were Devine,with a rich, cinnamon chocolate coating= tasty!\nAll in all , I still like this place . I will just order a different plate next time, I also may consider going to the Sahara location.? I love the idea and nostalgia Capo's brings so I am willing to give it another visit.  Try it for yourself , meanwhile I will forget about it !!!!!"

The whole Vegas mob vibe is alive and strong here with the secret entrance, password act, and dark setting. The live entertainer was great, he even sang a song we requested!\n\nService was amazing. Our glasses of water and wine never went below 1/2 full. We ordered the bruschetta (above average) as an appetizer. The house bread basket with garlic butter was yummy too. For entrees, he had the shrimp scampi and I had the Chicken Angelo. Both were amazing! I had the house italian salad and he had the caesar...very good as well. \n\nFor dessert we got the Italian coffee with amaretto...HIGHLIGHT of the meal by far! My pinot noir was fantastic too.\n\nOverall, the experience was phenomenal and I would recommend the restaurant to anyone any day. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the heat. We were sitting by an AC monitor that read the current temperature at 86 degrees. It was a little uncomfortable even for small people who love being in the warm outdoors! If the restaurant steps up their AC offering, they will be 5 stars for sure! Otherwise, I'll be back when the weather cools down ;)"

I stayed at the Luxor hotel and didn't rent a car, so I had to put a pretty big effort getting here which was a combination bus and taxi service. I needed a bus pass for other places, but the taxi was 22.00 with tip. I could have used my bus pass for Sahara west, but wasn't sure of the stops, but was able to uses the bus to get back to the strip.\n               When you get there you find the secret entrance and ring the bell, and the guy opens the slot in the door and lets you in. It was just me so they save the tables for couples and groups, so I sat at the bar. Service was fast and I liked the lady bartender, who recommended the steak. I first had the meatball appetizer, which had the most amazing sauce, with a bite to it I can't really describe. Most definitely not a sweet sauce. The steak was very good, cooked medium like I requested, and a very big cut with a lot of flavor, but it just wasn't the best I've ever had. If it had just been a bit more tender, and please don't tell me I requested it overcooked at medium. I've cooked so many steaks on the grill that I know even medium well to well done can be tender with a really good cut of meat from the butcher. I keep in mind that a steak on the strip could have been double the price here, and my bill including 3 pints of beer was only 61.00 before gratuity. Not bad for a popular spot in Vegas! I just wish I trusted my instincts, and had one of their Italian dishes instead of the steak. Especially after sampling the meatball. Still a great meal, and I love the d\u00e9cor and ambiance of the restaurant. Very dark and the menus have tiny flashlights attached so you can read the selections. By the time I left(arrived early) the live entertainment had started! I'm happy I planned and made the effort!"

When we got there for dinner the night of the reservation, we ended up at a table in the back next to the kitchen, no where near the entertainment and constant distractions from the kitchen and the back door where the employees where going to smoke.\n\nWhen the appetizers came, the waiter forgot one of the two we ordered.  He finally came back after our salad was served.  Blaming the kitchen for forgetting instead of himself....\n\nI thought the food was going to be amazing because of all the reviews, but to me, the food was over priced and mediocre in flavor and presentation.  As a matter of fact, my veal parmigiana was over cooked.  So disappointing..."

Last year I took my girlfriend for a romantic dinner and we were there for 3 hours and didn't even get our salads, this was due to the fact they were filming a \"real housewife\"eating dinner. So we got a glass of water and I had 1 beer and asked to speak to someone about an hour and a half into it. Noone came so we continued to wait when someone finally came over he tried to give me an attitude and hand me a bill for my food, I looked at him and laughed and said I'm not paying got anything and left and vowed to never to go back. Well needless to say I had to give my favorite restaurant for 7 years one last shot me and a group of 10 friends went there on sat. For my birthday dinner everyone said there food was not good including mine, I had the veal parm and there was a pound of cheese covering it to start, it was very bland and not the same as the old recipe. We were there waiting for out check for an hour after we ate w didn't even see our server, and the place only had 3 tables of people so it's not like they were busy.

The one thing I'm always impressed by is when you have a large group of people, and they provide excellent customer service. We had a group of 11 people and only 1 waitress.

I never recommend places that I haven't been to, but all of my friends that I trust had recommended it to me. I'm so glad I made the choice! Everyone loved everything they got, and the best in my opinion was the Chicken Marsala. Most of us passed around our dishes to try everything out, and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I do love Italian, and I have been very picky on the places that I like. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. I just feel they're all the same and generally the same \"OK\" type of quality of food. There are a few exceptions, but I usually shy away from these places. \n\nI see people on here complaining about the prices. I feel that the prices are very reasonable, and here is why - \nThe dinners come with bread, soup or salad. \nThey give you large portions (even though I typically appreciate smaller portions so I don't over eat.)\nThey have live entertainment, I'm sure it's mostly in the evenings. \nThe ambiance and the experience. It's cute and \"mob\" style. \nThe service. I always pay attention to the service and the service around me, and everyone seemed very content. The singer and the manager even thanked us for coming in and dining with them. \n\nPeople need to take in account for everything, not just the prices, especially if it's worth the prices and it's good food. \n\nI know it may not be consistent across the board for everyone, but I had an awesome experience. Go to their website, look at their menu before you go. It's definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys something different than the norm."

My wife got 100 dollars for 50 on groupon so we tried it out, otherwise we would of never gone to this place.\n\n Inside is cool, and that is about the only good thing they have going for them. \n\nThe waitress was rude and only checked on us twice in the 2 hours we were there. Why were we there for two hours? well the waitress did not care about us and thats how long it took us to get served the crappiest italian food I ever ate. My wifes ravioli had 5 pieces covered in soupy alfredo which cost 25 bucks. I have chicken parm in which it had no chicken, and kids has spaghetti and meatballs. Every plate of horrible.\n\nWe really could not wait to get out of the place. I would never recommend this place to any of my friends. Costs over 100 bucks easy for a family and its the worst. Seriously, CiCis pizza would of been better."

            "review": "Easily my favorite casual dining restaurant in Las Vegas! \n\nThis place came highly recommended from a colleague, someone I didn't trust much, but she raved about the secret entrance, wonderful atmosphere and fantastic food and she looked like she knew a thing or two about food (if you know what I mean). \n\nMy fiance and I decided to check it out on one of our date nights and were immediately confused as to which entrance to go through, the (free) valet kid helped us out, it's all part of the atmosphere. Why they have valet, I'll never understand, especially since the restaurant is the only thing occupying a majority of spaces in this small shopping center. \n\nOnce inside, we were rudely asked, \"Can I help you?\" by a pair of eyes peaking through a secret sliding peep hole. Nervously, we told him of our reservation and to our enjoyment he opened the \"secret\" door, revealing a dark, noisy bar, chalk outlines on the floor, dim lighting, ornate chandeliers and wallpaper. A cheesy piano man was hitting the keys and singing Bobby Darin, a tip jar was perched at the edge of his mini grand while old mob movies played on flat screen TVs. Immediately, we fell in love with the place and still hadn't seen a menu. \n\nAnyone who knocks the atmosphere must be crazy, or simply prefers a quiet, intimate restaurant. Don't get me wrong, those kinds of places are fun, too, but this place is noisy, dark and heavily themed, I can't stress that enough and this is coming from someone who hates Rain Forest Cafe because of the atmosphere and theme.\n\nOur waiter was wonderful, he had a thick Italian accent, I believe fake, but still hilarious and he told us about the menu and gave us time to look over the menu after taking our drink orders. Cocktails are a bit expensive, but there aren't many quality bars in Vegas that serve cheap cocktails, so the price was mostly forgiven. \n\nWe each ordered a pasta dish, her the Lasagna and me the \"Angels with Dirty Faces,\" which is a bit heavy, but for a pepperoni fan like me, was extremely flavorful and delicious. Now, let me be honest about the food, this is in no way the best food in Las Vegas (so far, that belongs to Carne Vino at Palazzo, but that's another Yelp). This place is wonderful for its combination of theme, atmosphere and food, not one thing or the other. Remember Chuck E. Cheese's when you were a kid? That karma of arcade games, ball pit and mediocre pizza? Remember how fun that was? Now, improve the pizza, replace arcade games and ball pit with atmosphere and cocktails and you've got the kind of harmonious perfection that makes Capos such a fun, memorable place. \n\nWe've been here too many times to count and bring our out-of-town friends all the time and they love it. We've never had a bad experience. \n\nPlease give this place a try, if you're not a food snob, you will love it."

I loved the ambiance, the decor is beautiful and different from any Italian restaurant I've been to. The best part was of course the food and definitely the Frank Sinatra singer that dedicated songs to me all night since it was my birthday, it was so memorable! Definitely a night to remember!!!!  The staff is very helpful and attentive and the food is to die for! I made reservations for 11 people for my birthday dinner and from the moment we came in the host and the waiters turned all their attention to our every need. By far the best costumer service I have ever received. they made us feel right at home, very welcomed specially our older waiter he was so nice. I highly recommend this place wether you're going on a date or just a girls night out , it's the perfect place to go and you will definitely enjoy it!"

We had a rather large party, dinner was supposed to be at 8:00PM. Unfortunately, some of the party arrived about 8:20, so we had been sitting for 1/2 and hour waiting for other half of party.  Meanwhile, I could not even get a glass of water.  No bread. No waitress.  Even after rest of party arrived, I sat there for about 25 minutes until I flagged down a waitress and asked if we could please start ordering since its almost 9:00 and I have to get up for work.  She looked surprised.  I'm not sure how long she thought we were going to sit there before ordering. My husband ordered lasagna, as did 2 others.  When it came, it was cold. Hot plate, cold food.  When my husband told the waitress, she picked it up and said \"well the plate is hot!\"  That is not how you treat a customer paying 23.00 for a piece of lasagna.  I'm sorry, but Maggianos service is 100% better, food is cheaper, and more of it, as well as it tastes better.  The penne that I had tasted like it was rinsed with dirty sink water.  Perhaps if it wasn't as pricey as it is, I would not be complaining as much.  But with those prices, the service should be way better. I will not go there again, nor advise anyone else to."

It is a really cool place super super dark , which Is fine, but the darkness doesn't lean toward a romantic atmosphere , it just leads to an eyesore .  There is a Tiny little flashlight on the menu, but you Have to hold The little button down As You look at the Menu so its kind of tricky to read the menu and hold the flashlight .It's so dark you can barely see your food. Okay so I am a pretty easy going person with not much complaints ,  so let's move on to the decor . Super cool looking inside but looks kind of small , we were seated in a nice booth and waitress and host were super nice, we used a 50 gift certificate from restaurant.com which was well worth it . We ordered the calamari with peppers, and the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizers . The calamari was just okay. They tasted like the oil was a little burnt. Now for the stuffed mushrooms. They were really small little button mushrooms that were stuffed with prosciutto and smoked provolone cheese .  It seemed as though if you put your fork in it the mushrooms would fly off the fork and end up across the room  They were okay but it seemed like the chef poured chunks of kosher salt in it. As I did taste chunks of salt.  Now onto the entrees . They were very large portions my boyfriend ordered the carbonara and I ordered the stuffed ravioli. The ravioli was just okay it was cooked with peas and bacon and about 2 lbs of butter. It was way too oily for my tastes . And once more it had  chunks of kosher salt in it . (I don't know why the chef chooses to dress all the food with extra salt if your cooking fresh italian food the flavor comes from the fresh herb cheese and ingredients . Anyway  being that my boyfriend is Italian , we know really great Italian good when we taste it , and overall we were looking forward to a really great Italian meal with great pasta . This Pasta was just okay . It's good to go there for the experience , but not for authentic Italian food."

A secret door is opened. The place is dark, you get mini flashlights to look at the menu. The menu online was not the same as what we were given. \n\nService was so slow, maybe the service staff congregating. Thanks to the busser/ service assistant for at least refilling our drinks and replenishing our bread. The kitchen that is in sight of the tables lack a sense of urgency needed to provide a speed of service to turn the tables, maybe that explains the manager/host seemingly stressed out whisking in the dining room and out again with no purpose but to see we were all hungry staring about and doing little about correcting it.\n\nFood was enjoyable portion size smaller than that of most Italian restaurants I have visited. It stopped me from over eating and feeling stuffed, so I was okay with it. Service was slow to pay, watching your server having drama with staff, the bartender going off about something, I now understand why it  is kept so dark. \n\nI would go again, but not for a dressed up celebration dinner. Maybe take out because service was so slow."

It does look it but it really is not. Its a really unique and cool experience dining here. Besides the look when you enter it will be very gangster, very mafia, mobster feel. Don't let it bother you, me & my other half really enjoyed our lunch. It was our 2oth anniversary lunch. Our Las Vegas trip was for our 20th anniversary celebration and on our special day we dined here. We both had no complaints. \n\nAs a FYI- be prepare to eat in the dark, look at your menu in the dark, once you enter and once you get to the table, it is very dark. Guess its a great way to hide from the mobster!! haha. If you don't mind the dark.  My opinion, this is much more romantic. I had a hard time finding the bathroom in the dark and I had to go with my other half. It was really hard taking photos, you will need to use the flash on your phone. \n\nWe were in the area stopping at The California hotel and I recalled driving by this place,so I checked Yelp and the ratings and food photos looked awesome so Capo's we will go for lunch. They have a great lunch special so we opt for the special. \n\nOH my!!, Our meals were really delicious except for the salads were mediocre. Our pasta were so authentic. You would be surprised that this place has such amazing food. Our lunch entr\u00e9es were Capones Carbonara - the fettuccine pasta were al dente, the carbonara sauce was just right, not too rich. Big Dom's Primavera- Penne pasta tossed with fresh vegtables- really loved that the penne was al dente and loved the vegtables saut\u00e9ed perfect together. Me and the other half tried each other's entr\u00e9e and we enjoyed them both. The entr\u00e9e has interesting names but the description sure matches its name. \n\nAmazing food, great service, and Unique Mobster experience, you have to come check it out for yourself.\n\nNext visit I want to try the calamari, a different entr\u00e9e, and the cannoli. \n I can't wait to be back and I will definitely be back @ Capo's during my next Las Vegas vacation!!"

I'd say he was in his very early 20s and would touch my dad on his shoulder a few times, he's call both of us bro, bud, etc . If it was part of the atmosphere of the place then yea it's no problem but in this case it wasn't. Although he was attentive (which I definitely appreciate) and he was nice and wasn't at all rude, he needs to learn how to talk respectfully to his customers.  All in all he did a good job and he'll learn. \n\n1 thing that was a big disappointment.. DESSERT!  I have been to Noras and now here and both have awful desserts. I tried the Tiramisu here and it was blah!  I haven't met an italian yet in vegas who can make a good Tiramisu, they make it the american way and it's not very good :-(  \n\nOther then dessert, we will definitely be back very soon."

            "review": "I had high hopes for Capo's Italian Cuisine.  Two stars is all I can come up with for this place.  Somethings are on me.  Like not really mapping out how far this place was from mid-strip.  We paid $27.50 + a $5.00 tip for a taxi from the Monte Carlo.  So figure you're into roughly a $65.00 round trip cab fare just to get here and back to your hotel.  That was on me.\n\nIt was 100 degrees outside in the early evening.  The secret door was kinda of fun.  We gave the password to my GF's daughter to get us in.  First impression, it's hot in here.  77 degrees inside.  The host seats us at the first booth we come to in the bar area facing the bar, a TV showing the The Shawshank Redemption, and the open kitchen.  Heat from the kitchen is coming right at us.  Not good.\n\nI got up and asked the host now sitting at the bar if we can be seated in the main dinning room which is pretty much empty.  One booth out of five is occupied.  There's a big table set in the middle for maybe a party of ten?  I don't know.\n\nThe host says-\nWell, you know here's the thing........we have a big party coming in and....we gotta lot of reservations.....and let me see what I can do....and I'm not to sure.....and let me check on something.....and so on and so on. \n\nMy inner monolog is saying to me-\nThis guy wants me to break out some cash for a better table in this empty hot and stuffy restaurant.  Are you fucking kidding me guy?  I just shelled out over $30.00 bucks just to get here!  Really?  I'll stand my ground.\n\nThe host continues-\nYeah, you know we got this big party coming in and we are really busy and, and, and.........Okay, okay, okay, I'll get a booth setup for you.  \n\nFor the record, only one other couple came in while we were there and the big table got broken down and put away half way through our dinner cause no one ever showed up.  Now, I have no real proof he was shaking me down, but I think he was.  Not cool.  \n\nWe got the temp down to 72 degrees and things were looking up.  Martini time.  I had two and they were good.  Our waitress was very nice to us.  Oh yeah, as others have mentioned it's pitch black in here.  99 Cent store mini flashlights that weren't working very well are attached to the menus.  It was a struggle reading the menu.\n\nFood-\n\nFried Calamari-\nNot bad.  No tentacles.  Boo.\n\nMe-\nSalad- Over dressed and limp.  \nVeal Parmesan-  Surprisingly good.  I always give credit when due.\nPasta- Under cooked.\n\nQueen of Reseda's Daughter-\nSoup- Bland.\nRacketeers Ravioli- She liked it.\n\nQueen of Reseda-\nSoup- Bland.\nVeal Marsala- Chewy, she did not like.\nPasta- Under cooked.\n\nEntertainment-\nThe live Frank Sinatra type singer was cool at first.  The Queen of Reseda's daughter was the only single looking female in the place as far as I could see.  \nHe serenaded her once, she liked it.  \"Return to me.  Please come back bella mia\"\nHe serenaded her twice, okay fine.  Move on Broheim. \nHe serenaded her a third time and it started to get really old, really fast.  \nWe laughed about it later, but it was borderline uncomfortable for a while there.\n\nAfter dinner we asked if they would call us a cab.  They have there own driver which they offered to take us back to our hotel.  It was a flat $25.00 plus I gave him a $5.00 tip.  We took them up on their offer, the driver was very nice and got us home safe. \n\nIMO these guys have figured out how to stack the deck with the Yelp reviews.  Soon after I posted this review, four new five star reviews mushroom up pushing this one down.  Take notice how most of these reviews are pretty short and sweet by people with not a lot of friends.  \n\nSome guy wrote how it was packed on a Monday night?  BS.  We were there on a Sunday night and it was dead.  I wish I would have checked out the 166 other reviews that are not currently recommended before coming here.  166!  Check them out for some very interesting reading.  \n\nI regret coming here.  I felt like I wasted a dinner in Vegas.  You'd be better off at Casa di Amore.  We had a great time earlier this year.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-di-amore-las-vegas"

For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmagiana and penne ala vodka. Both were just simply amazing. I substituted the spaghetti for pesto pasta which was also great. Overall this has been one of the best Italian places that my wife and I have been to across the US. It's such a great place and totally worth the trek off the strip. Not to mention the entire ambiance of the place rocks starting from he very cool way that they greet you at the entrance. Thank you Capos! \n\nPS - be sure to check the address that uber suggests for this place as it is not current with their actual location. We learned this the hard way after going to their previous address suggested by Uber."

For dessert we had Tiramisu martinis which was fantastic - hit the spot after such a decadent meal.

            "review": "We were on our way to Vegas and I happened to catch an episode of Mystery Diners or something like that, on Food Network. I really appreciated that they were trying to figure out a way to manage the experience of table side and live entertainment without the added drama of expecting patrons to tip. The place looked nice on the show, so we made a reservation and drove over there during our vacation.\n\nWe were kind of confused by the entrance and the vestibule to get in was uncomfortably hot as we tried to figure out if we were at the right place or some kind of mob front... So I guess they have it going on there. \n\nThe server was friendly. My husband had an Italian Margarita. It was delicious. I don't care for drinking much, but yum! The cheesy bread was great, as everyone describes. I loved the orange sauce.\n\nI was excited about the table side magician--even though it was a different guy than was featured on the show. The singer was singing along \"dedicating\" songs to everyone in the house. It was kind of annoying because he kept talking to us directly and calling us my name.  As we ate our appetizer, we noted that the table side magician was finishing up with another table--and very directly solicited a tip. This annoyed me because I had taken the show on faith as an infomercial for good, honest service without this pressure.\n\nWe passed, very firmly, on the table side entertainment.  After three times of insisting that we would rather engage in intimate conversation, he finally moved along.\n\nOur entrees--ravioli and stuffed rigatoni-- were delicious. We passed on dessert. Had we not been driving back to the strip, my husband would have definitely had another drink--it was that good.\n\nAll in all, the food was good.  If you're into mob stuff, you'll probably love it: There are streaming gangster movies in the background.  If you're looking at reviews because you learned about this establishment from the show they were on--it is no longer their policy to refuse tips, and I think that's pretty dishonest to perform, then pretty much demand a tip."

Just to experience the restaurants environment is already a plus. The moment you walk in, you have no idea what your getting yourself into. Since its a mob theme you walk into a small room with a phone booth and pictures, and when you ring the door bell a man greets you behind a framed picture and a secret door opens up to a beautiful dark romantic room! As your seated a menu with a flashlight is given to you and the atmosphere has a romantic yet mob feeling to it. The Caesar Salad was to die for it was the best Caesar Salad I have ever eaten!! My husband had the \"Scarface Shrimp Scampi'\" and I Had the Don's Spaghetti.\" my hubby's was just alright but the Spaghetti was scrumptious! I had the chocolate Martini it was strong, decadent and Delicious! You should make reservations cause this place gets packed!

This is not the fanciest restaurant but it's totally old school. The red leather booths, the stage for performance, the piano guy and all the attitude that comes with the people. That's their thing.

Um...we have resos at 8 please and with not okay, thanks, welcome, he opens the door and says to follow him. Again.....this is their thing. This is the image of the restaurant. In no way were we offended because I had reviewed their restaurant prior to going. \n\nWe sat down and the amazing service immediately started. Since the restaurant was very dark inside (image), they had these little cute lights hanging from their menus. The names of all their drinks and dishes were so COOL. I ordered the dirty martini (their special) and it was so delicious. My husband ordered this drink called \"kick in the head\". Ha!

Everyone from the person that seats you, to the servers, to the cooks--you can see them cooking from the bar seats-- the customer and your experience is what matters.  This alone is so much different than most other restaurants in Las Vegas.  This is actually what sets this restaurant apart from all the rest. The decor is great--puts you back into 1960--and so is the food.  Try everything, but most especially you cannot miss the calamari. This place is sure to last because they go above and beyond.

            "review": "Love love love! Great food, wonderful service, and beautiful setting. You can taste that each meal is made with love and is truly authentic (to me at least). Doesn't taste anything like your regular chain Italian restaurant. The service is by far the absolute best. Everyone is very professional and friendly. My water glass was never empty for more than five minutes. Constantly checking up on you just to see how you like your food. Setting wise, it's great. It's dark inside, but that's the whole point. If you can't see the menu, use the flashlight that comes with it. There's a gentleman by the piano singing at dinner time. I thought he was lip syncing because it sounded so lovely. He's actually singing though. I go every time I'm in Vegas. \n\nTip: It is better to make reservations online because they get very busy at dinner time."
