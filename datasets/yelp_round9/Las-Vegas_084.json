Nothing that really wowed me or stood out. Things were not over salted which I appreciated.\n\nDefinitely go here if you like a nice traditional meal with large portions. I would not have picked this place to eat honestly, my Dad was just in the mood for a good steak I guess.\n\nThe waiter was really weird and would not stop saying \"that's a trip!\" \"what a trip!\". I called him out on that because that's how I roll."

            "review": "Every casino has a fancy steakhouse.  My bucket list is to try them all.  My favorite cut is the Ribeye due to it's correct fat to meat ratio making it tasty and tender.  I couldn't wait to try this place.  Nice and fancy.  They display their cuts and specializes in aged beef.  Unfortunately, the service was horrible. Not only it was slow, they got our orders wrong twice in one night.  On top of that, my cut was overcooked, which is just wrong.  Sending it back corrected it, but it wasn't tender.  I don't mind paying a high price for steak, but it must be great, and mine wasn't.  The whole table agreed that they wouldn't come back.  The sides were small yet good and the staff was friendly.  Unfortunately that won't get me back to this place."

It came cooked perfectly, and the cut itself was high grade beef, not like at those \"prime rib deal\" places. The creamed spinach and mashed potato (with a trio of aged cheese) were the perfect compliments. My daughter had the New England clam chowder and it arrived filled with clams. She was so stuffed, her calamari was barely touched even though it's lightly breaded and deep fried preparation was too much for me to resist.\nYou can expect excellent service to go with the meal. I will definitely try their signature steaks next time we are in Vegas."

            "review": "Our first night in town we decided to dine in the casino we were staying at. A steakhouse immediately got me salivating as I was perusing the often mediocre hotel dining options available to me.\n\nWe walked down and were seated quickly. The waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable. Actually I was super impressed with his knowledge of not only the different options, but the intricacies of each. I ordered the fillet mignon  and a side of creamed spinach. My companion ordered the soup of theday (I believe is was cream of tomato or something like that) and a Caesar salad. We also ordered bruschetta as an appitizer.\n\nThe bruschetta came out soon enough. It was pretty good but we both thought it was a little too salty and too covered in olive oil. Not a huge disappointment but definitely not that great either.\n\nOur entrees came out shortly after and I was thoroughly impressed. Though a bit pricey, my fillet was super tender and moist. I ordered it medium-rare (as I order all my red meats) and it was cooked perfectly. The creamed spinach was really good as well and definitely went well with the cut of cow in front of me.\n\nHer soup and salad were both satisfying, though the salad was wrapped in large leaves of lettuce that were somewhat difficult to cut-up. After a short, small struggle everything was consumable and delicious.\n\nOverall our meal was great. The service was fantastic and the quality of the food and selection was excellent. Not a five-star steakhouse by any means but far better than I'd ever imagine hotel-dining to be."

Well for the price it better be huge!\n\nAnyways, I love the presentation of the dishes and I love the side dishes. The mushrooms are good even if they were your typical button mushroom and so is the mashed potato. The portions were big enough for my friend and I to split. I love how they place the roasted garlic on there as well, it adds so much more flavor. \n\nRight next to us, a couple ordered the lobster and I don't even know how to describe this thing. First of all, it was huge. Secondly, they made this lobster into some sort of masterpiece. The presentation of it was just unbelievable. I would want to try that but by the looks of it, I would probably be broke afterwards. \n\n\nThis place is no joke, do not come here if you're on a budget. You are seriously going to burn a hole in your pocket. But if you do come here, get their prime rib, it's what they're known for."

We started with oysters & also had tried the crab legs. I rated this place 3 stars overall including service, and quality of food. \n\n\nAs an aspiring  grillmaster & BBQ extraordinaire this place was not up to my standards for the price I had paid. Good steakhouse, but not great or excellent!\n\n\nDel Frisco's is still my reigning #1 in LV"

I mean this foodie friend has a reputation - a reputation that when he says a place is the best, it is the best.  \n\nThis place was far from the best.  The only thing it had was BIG steaks, meant for giants.  Yes, they aged the steaks.  Seriously, it was very unimpressive.  If you want giant steak, go here.  If you want good steak, go to Mastro's."

            "review": "Gallagher's is home to the best steak meal I have ever had and also one of the worst.  The first time my man and I dined here we ordered a dry aged filet for him and the steak and lobster special for me...long story short, my plate was $200 of pure, unadulterated goodness (In related news, you should probably ask how much Market Price is...now we know) containing a 20-ounce sirloin AND a WHOLE LOBSTER (Seriously.  Not the tail.  THE WHOLE THING.) that was cracked at the table for me.  It was amazing and continues to reign supreme as the most expensive thing I have ever eaten.  The second time we came, I was still in awe of my last trip and expected the same glorious experience to happen again (this time with less steak and lobster).  The second time around, however, I spent a ton of money on an overcooked, dry, and tasteless steak.  How a restaurant can deliver such opposing meals makes it hard to want to come here for a third try.  I want to go again, especially when staying at NYNY, but I'm afraid the consistency just isn't there...OR I can go with the knowledge that I will have to be that guy and send my steak back (which I NEVER do) because for the money I am paying, the steak should blow my mind."

            "review": "Dinner here before Zumanity left W lightly dozing through the show, despite the beautiful bodies prancing on stage. To be fair, his prime rib put the largest serving at House of Prime Rib in San Francisco to shame, dwarfing the plate it arrived on. Our server started us off with seriously delicious cranberry walnut bread and a fluffy standard house loaf. The butter came room-temperature and lightly whipped, perfect for spreading. \n\nMy filet mignon was tender and flavorful. As our server warned, the middle was a bit more rare than I usually expect for med-rare. I finished it easily without an additional sauce, but enjoyed a few pieces with the horseradish offerings that W requested with his prime rib. Notably, there were a few cuts that were sinewy and difficult to hack through with my knife, which was a bit dull. \n\nFor the price of our cuts, I was surprised at how sparse they arrived. Our server recommended selecting 2-3 sides to share between the four of us. Thank goodness we did, because the filet mignon only came with a fried cassava/taro/? chip and some peppery mach lettuce. French green beans were garlicky and crisp, and mushrooms were cheesy and rich. \n\nSeated across from the kitchen, we could see that the bruschetta was an understandably popular appetizer. The diced tomato glistened like small jewels from the baguette slices on the counter. \n\nS polished the cowboy ribeye neatly, but there were quite a few pieces of fat that he cut away and left behind. Plenty of fried onion strings to share!"

            "review": "I have enjoyed many a steak in this great town known as Las Vegas, and each and every one was delicious beyond belief. It really (for me) boils down to the consumer experience. You're paying a premium price you should expect premium service. And the team behind the bar at Gallaghers did not disappoint. More specifically Shaun. The man, a tall drink of water and was without a shadow of a doubt sculpted in the likeness of Michaelangelo's David. The Adonis of a man stands about 6'6 with a personality that was larger than life. His initial greeting was warmer than Phoenix in July, and I felt as if I just stepped into the house of an old friend. He oozed personality and always had a poignant point about anything that was topical. Weather it be the latest sports scores, current events, or 9/11 conspiracies, Shaun was always on point and informative. Some might call him a \"jack of all trades\" or a \"renaissance man\" if you will, me (after the one visit), I call him a friend.  Let's not forget the other two fine gentlemen behind the bar. Diminutive in stature but not \"short\" on personality either. I think the shortest of the twos name was Gary. Standing (what seemed to be) a mere 4'11 was surely channeling his personal idol with his Gomer Pyle hair cut. And the man only known by a letter G stood a towering 5'2. He seemed to be the strong silent type.  This was by far the best experience I've ever had at a bar, steak house, or Vegas all together. This is by far the best experience I've ever had and I will definitely be back."

            "review": "The steaks at this restaurant are outstanding. They dry age the sirloins for 14 days which \"darkens the color, deepens the flavor, and tenderizes the connective tissue\". Translation: they taste REALLY *REALLY* good. \n\nThe restaurant seemed fairly small so if it's a busy night or you like to eat at prime time (like 7:00pm), you might want to get a reservation. \n\nAnother thing to note.. Like most nicer restaurants, everything is a la carte. They did provide bread (several kinds). I had a Cesare Salad which was good, but it was served I'm wedge form. It would have been better a little more \"disassembled\".\n\nTwo of my party got the New England Clam Chiwder (the white one) and they both fished it quickly and one mopped up the extra with bread.. I'm taking that as a 'yum'.\n\nThey have a nice selection of sides, from mushrooms to asparagus to baked or mashed potatoes. The asparagus was steamed but I asked if they would grill it and he accepted with out even thinking about it...\n\nThe steaks were awesome. We had two filets and two of the house aged sirloins, and everyone marveled at their steaks.  They were cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nThey do have other cuts, and chicken and seafood, but where I'm sire they're god, none of us had them. \n\nIf you're looking for steak, this is a great alternative to the $50-$60 steak places. You won't be disappointed, or hungry!"

We ordered the cowboy ribeye medium rare and it must have been the toughest piece of meat I have ever eaten in a steakhouse. I was actually afraid of choking between the grizzle and the toughness that I cut the pieces much smaller than I ever would otherwise. I have eaten at steakhouses across the country and the meat quality here is shameful. \n\nService you ask? Wait, there is no server anywhere! We waited 20 minutes for bread after asking for some 4 times. Finally the bus boy was nice enough to get us some, not the waiter, not the manager... The service was just terrible. You don't expect to spend 70 bucks a person minimum and have to get up and find someone to refill your drink all night.  \n\nClearly, I would not recommend this place, what a waste of money. I would rate the quality of food here way below that of Outback Steakhouse. To be peddling this in any hotel on the Las Vegas strip is shameful."

My last experience was less then subpar but Brisa and Shepard from Gallagher's wanted to make it right and invited us back as their special guests to ensure everything was to our liking. We were first greeted by Jocelyn at the front desk and she walked us over to our table. She was very kind. John our server came by to greet us and filled us in on the daily special and took our drink order. Rafael was on it as well, he came by to make sure our waters were filled and cleaned up any remnants that we left on the table from the bread crumbs. The bread there is phenomenal. I try not to eat bread but when I do I will eat it at Gallagher's. \n\nWe started with the Shrimp and Grits appetizer. If there is one appetizer you order and you like shrimp, then this is the appetizer for you. The shrimp is succulent and cooked perfectly. We then moved on to salads. I had to go with the beet salad. Beets are great for the liver and the beets are roasted to perfection and they do not skimp on the beets. Wife loves the hearts of palm salad there. Then on to the steaks. The NY aged steaks are the way to go. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was cooked just the way I like it. The prices of the steaks are not that expensive when compared to the plethora of steak houses around Vegas. It seems like every hotel has their own signature steak house and they offer pretty much the same thing but the thing that sets Gallagher's apart is the nostalgia and that piece of NYC you would only find there. \n\nThe sides were amazing! The asparagus were about the size of bananas. Talk about asparagus on steroids. They were pumped up. I also ordered the chipotle cheesy Yukon gold mashed potatoes. I didn't want to share them with my wife. At first I told her they were the worst thing I ever tasted but she knew I was lying because my nose grew and I had a huge smile on my face after trying them. Do yourself a favor and order a side of mushrooms as well. \n\nThrough the years Gallagher's has been a regular in our rotation when visiting Vegas. We always receive top notch service and the food never leaves us in doubt. All of the employees are wonderful. I wish we could eat there more often but it's great to have it as a special place for us to visit. If you are in the area just stop by and try something. You will not be disappointed and if you are I am sure they will make it right. Thanks again to the staff at Gallagher's and to Brisa and Shepard for making sure the meal was to our liking. It was nice to also see Roxanna who goes around to take photos. She took our photo 10 years ago after we had a post wedding dinner party there. We decided to go with another round of photos and told her we would see her in another 10 years. And thanks again to John for wonderful service. Happy eating!"

Absolutely wonderful.\n\nDry Aged New York Sirloin $40 (Our Signature House-Aged Bone-In Sirloin). Tender and tasty.\n\nPorterhouse Steak $48. Surprisingly tender. I think this was even more tender than the sirloin. However, this piece was huge and had bone in middle. \n\nI really enjoyed it and especially sharing one big meal is good enough deal.

Not sure if expectations were too high from friends recommendations/yelp reviews, but this was one sad expensive meal. We made it right around 4 pm which is when dinner time starts. I will say that the service from the bus boys was impeccable and very friendly. Waiter was nice at first but after he brought entrees hardly checked on our party. Appetizer was ordered. Minutes later waiter comes back saying how they are out of clams. Should have taken this as a sign and gone somewhere else. Went with second choice calamari. It was just ok, have had same or better else where and portion was huge. Ordered 2 of the specialty steaks ( aged NY steak), Mac and cheese and potato wedges.  We both asked for medium rare. When stakes came out, 1 was almost burned and way over cooked. The other one almost raw. Took first bite and was trying to taste the flavor...again I have had way better many times for a whole lot cheaper. The meat was not tendered, it was hard to chew and swallow. The Mac and cheese was good and potato wedges....well they were just potato wedges ( go with something else, husband was just in the mood for steak and potatoes). We were so underwhelmed, tried to eat as much as we could without feeling guilty for throwing food in the trash. Best thing of the meal was the cucumber jalape\u00f1o margarita. Next time we want steak , will try another place."

From the beginning we were greeted by a friendly hostess and did not have to wait due to our reservation. Once seated, we were welcomed by a courteous, friendly and informative waiter. We asked for recommendations on the drinks, appetizers, and the steaks. Some were taken and others were not. I ordered the raspberry lemon drop martini, rimmed with sugar, the drink was delightful and hubby ordered his normal drink of an old-fashion with Jim Beam. Our appetizer, a waiter recommendation, was the oyster rockefeller, this appetizer was so good, it came with six sweet oysters topped with a spinach bread crumple and delicious cheese. We squeezed some lemon on top and they were gone before we blinked, great recommendation. \n\nOur second round of drinks, I ordered the Moscow mule, I'm a big fan of the floral notes and ginger beer in mules and the hubby ordered a blue moon. I ordered the pear& walnut salad, this was good but not great, plating and presentation could be better. My other half had the Caesar salad, same thoughts. Our main meals included petite filets and Australian lobster topped with crab. Our streaks were cook to our specifications, flavorful and tender but the star of the night was the lobster, so fluffy white and buttery...melt in ur mouth good! For the dessert we ordered the dessert of the evening, chocolate and red velvet heart pastries, a sweet finish to a great intimate dinner with my loved one."

This is by far the highlight of my meal there. The service was impeccable. WE had a really kind genuine waitress who was consistent in checking on us and spoke to us with purpose and interest. There was a separate guy who filled up waters/drinks, who was seriously on his game that night! He was like a ninja! I'll take a swig of my drink and look over into conversation with my party and look back to notice that my glass was refilled.... *cue eary music* *looks around but not a prospect in sight* haha! But that was awesome, some of the best service I have ever had. Extremely accommodating.\n\nAmbience was nice. The place has their lights low and you look around to a pretty restaurant. It feels like a classy night out, given your cutlery, the service, and the uniform the staff is wearing. But the customers are still casual so that sort of brings things back down to earth, which is fine by me.\n\nOk here we go, Food! I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye Steak, recommended by the waitress, with a side of macaroni and cheese. Now the steak was really good! (Next time I'll probably go Medium). I really enjoyed the steak but when it came down to complimenting it with a side, there were problems. The macaroni and cheese was bland. They attempted it with different noodles and a creamier white cheese but it lacked flavor and even after adding seasoning it just tasted generic. I tried my friend's french fries and I didn't care for those either, to my surprise! It seems like it would be hard to mess those up. They didn't mess it up but they tried a garlic seasoning or something but it ended up tasting bland. In the end I felt secluded to just the steak which was good but I wanted something else with it. For the money I paid for dinner I feel like my whole dinner should have been amazing. It's pretty pricey here guys so your wallet needs to match your hunger here\n\nIf you're just trying to find a great steak and nothing else then this wouldn't be a bad place to try."

For starters we had the shrimp cocktail and crab cakes both were good nothing out of the ordinary. I had the sirloin for my entr\u00e9e and it was tasty and tender. An unexpected treat was the roasted garlic bulb that I added to the steak and it was brilliant. My friend got the Surf and Turf fillet and Aussie lobster, very succulent and not over done for the lobster. We got the four cheese and Mac, Au Gratin Broccoli and Saut\u00e9ed green beans were all tasty. Nice atmosphere inside like many steakhouses I've been to white walls and medium shades of wood with pictures of stars. It's All good!"

I should have ordered the rib eye which was recommended by other yelp reviewers & our cab driver. \n\nAtmosphere is more relaxed being that it's in the NY NY casino, so we didn't feel out of place wearing jeans and a nice top.

One King Cut Prime Rib, about the size of a small dinosaur, landed with a thud on our table.  It was then I understood why my friend didn't order any sides.  This steak was  going to be a challenge.  \n\nAnother challenge unfortunately, was understanding the price tag.  I get it.  Fine dining atmosphere, dry aged beef and fresh seafood.  To me it was a fluffed up steakhouse.  Not bad, but not outstanding enough to shell out that kind of dough again.  \n\nLocated inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino right near the main entrance.  The restaurant is completely open facing the commotion of the casino passers by.  The bar wraps around so you can have a drink while waiting for a table.  It's decorated with photos of famous New York alumni covering the walls.  You can take a look at the steak they use in a window outside, dry aging under bright lights.  Looks like something out of Dexter.  We made an Open Table Reservation and we were seated right on time.  It took a few minutes to be acknowledged after we sat down, but our waiter was pleasant and fun once he arrived.  \n\nI ordered the Filet and my boyfriend ordered the Dry Aged New York Sirloin.  Both our steaks were the wrong temperature.  I don't normally eat meat, so an under cooked steak is cringe-worthy to me.  I toughed through it because we needed to be at a concert.  The soup I ordered was a beer cheese soup and it was probably the highlight of my meal, along with the side of mushrooms I ordered.  The asparagus tasted like pure butter and they were cold.  Then a family sat down next to us and we watched a little kid eat a filet with ketchup.. oh boy.  It was cute that the waiter cut the steak for him though.\n\nMan Vs. Food challenge:  Food wins!

That aside, we were so excited about the bread since you usually get really yummy bread at steakhouses. The bread was the really crusty kind and flaky but soft in the middle, a sourdough loaf. Not what we were expecting. I guess I am used to the pretzel bread, cheesy bread, and all the other cool kinds of bread you get at other steakhouses. \n\nThe service was very good, someone there to fill your water every time you took a sip practically. My friend and I shared the cowboy rib-eye steak $38 it was very big. The steak just wasn't as good as I hoped for. The sauce on top was good. We shared 4 cheese mac and cheese and creamed spinach-both I enjoyed. But usually sides at steakhouses are always good. The portion was pretty small on the sides. \n\nWe shared a toffee bread pudding dessert with vanilla ice cream. It was the size of a brownie.

We walked in and the table was ready right away and it has the complete feel of a traditional steak-house and one that would be home in downtown Manhattan (or so I imagine what that would look like). We started with oysters and crab salad. The oysters were good but the crab was incredible. Very fresh and lots of meat. I would get the crab salad again any day of the week.\n\nI had ordered a filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked a little on the medium side but it still had it's rare-ish quality that made it juicy. My girlfriend, who is not a big steak eater, ordered the house steak with hollandaise sauce. Normally, I'm weary of steak places that offer sauce on their steak. call me old-fashioned, but I was raised in the school of a good steak doesn't need anything added to it. Save for a little garlic butter, but other than that, grill it and give it to me as is. However, as she ordered it medium-well, having the sauce there was a good option. The steak was still delicious and, more importantly, she loved it.\n\nLastly, an odd encounter happened there that made our trip funny as hell. So we were sitting next to each other and a group of older gentlemen sat next to us. On their way out, they slipped us a note saying that we were a cute couple and to save room for dessert and to try the \"sticky toffee pudding\". But the way they phrased the note, left room for multiple interpretations. So we called the waiter over, explained what happened and he laughed and gave us his opinion as to what he thought the note meant. He apologized for the enounter, and we assured him it wasn't a big deal at all, we just thought it was funny. He said it would have made more sense if they had actually bought us a dessert, but they didn't, so he had no clue what they were talking about. HOWEVER, when dinner was done, the waiter came over with the sticky toffee pudding and gave it to us on the house as a means of apologizing for his other table. It was completely unneccessary, but amazing customer service. The food gets 4 stars, the dessert was INCREDIBLE and gets 5 stars, but the service there gets 10 stars. I work in sales and appreciate good customer service and attention to detail and was VERY impressed with these guys.

The clam chowder was a bit too salty for our taste  - everyone at the table had a bowl.  Then the highlight, the steaks. We were given an additional complimentary prime rib, courtesy of the chef! Each one was perfectly cooked except for one NY Steak was medium instead of medium rare - but no matter because we couldn't even finish every plate (we did wonder if the comped prime rib was because of the overcooked NYsteak...).  The crown jewel, our Cowboy ribeye. Oh my god, i was so happy we went with this. It has the tenderness and fattiness of the prime rib, but the charred and tastiness of the NY strip. I was so full but just couldn't let even one bit go to waste. \n\nOne steak is definitely enough to share between two people if you're having appies and soups like us. We left with a full stomach and a smile fueled by gluttony on our faces. Definitely will be back next time we're in town."

Got the same excellent steps of service and tasty food for about $100 less compared to others (craft steak, etc). Both husband and I ordered rib-eye and shared jalapeno mashed potatoes (special), mushrooms, and creamed spinach. DELICIOUS! The choices of bottles of wine are very reasonable.

I had the Surf and Turf which comes with a Lobster stuffed with Crab Meat yummy!! and a steak which was very very Good!! My husband had the Porter House Steak and let me tell you it was huge and so juicy and flavorful! Dinner was Yummy! Our waiter was so nice too and very attentive. We did not feel rushed and we ordered some drinks and enjoyed it. Gallagher's is a Steakhouse were you can have drinks and have classy romantic dinner with your better half or a fun dinner with your friends. I recommend that when in Vegas try New things and classy things as well. Thank you Gallagher's we had a Fabulous Time! We will be back!"

I really did.\n\nUnfortunately, our dining experience was less than stellar:\n- My husband was not served alcohol because he left his ID in our hotel room even though my 60-year-old-plus parents vouched for his age (he's 29). We hadn't been carded the entire trip. I get that they don't want to get in trouble, but this was annoying.\n- It took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get bread, and we received our entrees ONE HOUR after ordering. We ordered after 8PM on a Sunday night, and they were not swamped with customers.\n- One of my fellow table guests asked the bread/water server for an update on our food, and he said he'd check with our server. Our server Linda consequently ignored us until our food arrived, about 15 minutes later. We tried to make eye contact with her to no avail while she was checking on other tables around us.\n- Several dishes were cold when we finally got them (i.e. French fries, which are never good cold).\n- My husband found several hairs in his food about 10 minutes after we were served. We told our server. She came over and asked if he had saved the hairs for her to see. Who saves hairs they find in their food? That's disgusting! Look on the floor where he tossed them!\n- The manager came by after our server told him about the hairs on my husband's plate. He too questioned my husband if he saved the hairs (um, no). The manager said, \"I'm surprised, this usually doesn't happen\" - I would certainly hope not!\n- Neither our server or the manager offered to get another meal for my husband (again, after waiting an hour to get our food, so we were all hungry!). They took his hairy food off the bill, but such an accusatory attitude toward a guest is awful. They were both defensive and arrogant when it came to trying to make the situation better.\n\nOverall, I was extremely disappointed. To wait an hour for food, topped off with rude staff, is unacceptable when you're spending $50+ per person on food and drinks. I work in customer service myself so I know how important it is to cater to your guests. The sad part is, it's Vegas and they don't care if you ever come back, so they could care less about keeping their customers happy.\n\nI emailed Gallagher's customer service (via their website, not New York New York's), so it will be interesting to see if I get a response back."

The price/quality of their signature steak was great...we just left feeling very underwhelmed by the quality of the service. \n\nWe originally booked a reservation here because it was around the corner from the Zumanity show that we had tickets for. The hostess we originally talked to was very polite and informative letting us know that a 9:30 pm booking was probably the best time since our show was for 7:30. At this point, we had high hopes for this place. \n\nThe day of our booking we called to confirm our reservation and the hostess hung up on my bf mid sentence saying, \"No we don't have a booking under that name.\" Confused, I called back, and they eventually found our name. I wanted to make sure I received the check since it was my bf's b-day weekend. She said \"Ok\" then hung up without asking me which of the 4 people under our reservation that I was. \n\nOur server was ok...but obviously didn't get the message about the check. (Surprise Surprise) When we asked for our check she threw it down next to my bf. Of course if he sees the check he's going to try to pay for it!!! It was his birthday, this is what I was trying to avoid!"

I told my girlfriend that the only two things I *had* to do during our stay in Vegas was hit the buffet at the Bellagio and have a steak at a fancy, classy steakhouse. The steak was the highlight of our trip.\n\nWe made reservations, and arrived 15 minutes early but were seated immediately even though we were prepared to wait at the bar. I would have preferred slightly more room between tables and a little less noise, but otherwise I felt the place was very comfortable. Our waiter was very courteous. I wore a sports jacket/tie and my gf wore a LBD, but it looks like the dress code isn't that strict. Still, I'm glad we took the classy route. You can relax and go slightly more casual if you want, but if you want to dress nicer like we did you'll fit in, too.\n\nI ordered the signature sirloin, and I can't imagine why anybody would get any other steak. The filet may be more tender, but it couldn't possibly have flavor like this and believe me it was VERY tender. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. The edges were just a bit caramelized, the inside was a nice even pinkish-red. I love how they keep it on the bone, it really enhances the flavor. My girlfriend ordered the pork chop. I expected a single double-thick chop but instead it was two thinner chops, but it was still very tender. I had a taste and the sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but it was excellent. My gf loved it. She asked our waiter a question about what fruit it was made with, and he knew the answer without any hesitation at all (apricot I think?). VERY good waiter. We shared our sides, the potato certainly lived up to its \"colossal\" billing and the asparagus was nice and crisp, although I could have done without the heavy hollandaise sauce.\n\nI ordered a wine by the glass. At the end of my second glass as we were getting ready to leave, I noticed there was a wine sediment at the bottom of my glass. I was impressed with the service and I'm sure if I'd noticed it when I started drinking it, they would have fixed it for me. So I don't hold it against them. My gf was very happy with her cocktail.\n\nWe were too full (and satisfied) to try dessert."

I was brought here by Zumanity though, attending with my girlfriend.  And since the love of her life is meat, the choice on where to eat was easy.\n\nIt all started with the drink.  A Manhattan.  I subbed olives, because maracschino cherries make me cringe.  And I got blue cheese olives, and a beautiful Manhattan.  I ended up getting 2 more, and the waiter complimented me on my drinking.  Haha.  He made me feel like a real boy!\n\nSo we got sauteed mushrooms and some steaks.  I went with the prime rib.  There's something magical about a perfectly seared steak, sure.  But I can't roast a rack of ribs at home.  And the slightly more cooked bits on the edge of the roast make a great salty counterpoint to the moist, tender, juicy middle bits.  Plus it comes with meat juice on the side.  Love me some meat juice.  Jen really liked her steak too.  \n\nAll in all, I was thrilled by the service, who specifically rushed out bill so we could get out in time for our show.  I loved the food and drinks too.

The Brussels sprouts were very tough and the O-Rings were barley warm. Some will say, why didnt you send it back? Well it take about 20+ minute to re-fire a steak that large! After 2-3 cocktail and an app who wants to wait and eat then?  It was not the worse thing in the world and the char on the steak was great tasting. But with as many steak as they cook there is no reason to over cook a steak! \nNeedless to say after waiting that long to visit they fell short.

It is one thing to recommend a place to strangers and coworkers, and quite another to recommend a place to your *boss* and then bring him there. Never mind bringing HIS boss with you, too. No pressure, right?\n\nI made a reservation for part of our team following a long day of work at a conference in the Mandalay Bay. We needed to get out for some air and had spent nearly a week cooped up in the convention center. I thought I knew just the place and made a reservation online using OpenTable. \n\nOur table was ready at the reservation time, and our server, John, was fantastic. We were seated at the \"chef's table\" in the kitchen area -- which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on the restaurant and the people you're with. It turned out for us to be a good thing and we'll request that next time (it is a U-shaped booth that holds 7 people). Some of the people weren't as hungry, so they decided to split a steak and some appetizers. I just wanted the signature NY strip that I remembered. \n\nThe place was crowded, and it took a little time to get the food, but I don't think we were ever left wondering or looking at our watches. If you're in a hurry, though, this may not be the place for you. Good takes time, so be prepared to be patient :)\n\nAll of our steaks were cooked perfectly and the shrimp+grits appetizer was a group favorite. I'm not a shrimp person, but those \"shrimp\" were like little lobster tails! The side dishes were reasonable priced, and I recommend the mac and cheese with bacon in it if they have it. The peppercorn sauce was a few bucks more, but it was a nice accompaniment to my steak. There was enough to share, so I did, and those who tried it enjoyed it as well. \n\nBeware the fresh horseradish with the prime rib -- it is pretty potent. \n\nYou'll have a big piece of meat, but be sure to save room for the toffee pudding... even if you have to share it like we did. \n\nFor the quality of service and food, the price we paid was more than reasonable and we will definitely be back when we are in town again next year. Thank you John for taking care of us!"

Clam chowder was packed with flavor, not too thin not too thick. Just right. The Caesar Salad was good not great.\n\nWe split the 16oz Cowboy Ribeye - Cooked medium. That's where the dining experience all went downhill. When I'm at a steak place, I know when I first bite into a nice piece of steak that it should sing to me. Well, after my first bite, my first reaction was, \"this is not juicy at all!\" It's dry and very chewy. In fact my wife said her jaw was hurting from all the chewing. Not very good. For $48 ribeye it sure wasn't up to par im afraid. On the plus side, Yukon gold potato pur\u00e9e was really good and so was our creamed spinach. And oh the free cranberry bread was good."

The are pictures and caricatures of various old school celebs on the walls. Actually, its a pretty good knockoff of the NYC original. It's also pretty loud - very much like the NYC original. The steaks however, I think are a little BETTER than the NYC original! \n\nThe first thing you notice is the meat - it's aging on display right in the front window. Can't miss it. Some may find this distasteful - I find it quite cool. And make no mistake - the steak is what it's all about here. The classic NY Sirloin Strip for about $40 is served on the bone. It's juicy, full of dry aged beef flavor, and just a bit firm to the tooth - note:not tough!- as a good NY Strip should be. And yes, it was aged in the window. The sides aren't as exciting but still very good. The steak fries were huge, crispy, and served with a killer chipotle ketchup. The sauteed spinach was simple yet delicious. \n\nThe wine list wasn't the greatest but there was a very nice Merlot served by the glass that went exceptionally well the steak - as a good Merlot should. Oh, service was acceptable. \n\nIs this the best steakhouse in Vegas? Probably not. But it's also a couple of dollars less expensive than the other high end steak places. All in all a good, solid steakhouse. You won't go wrong eating here."

None of that watered down creamy crap that so many restaurants serve. Their horseradish is off the wall totally destroys your taste buds kinda thing. I can't even say take a \"pea-sized\" amount with a bite of rib-eye (my favorite at the restaurant btw). Even a pea-sized amount will have you screaming for relief. \n\nOther than that, nothing more special in a 4 star restaurant. Service is excellent, decor is decent, and a great place to bring a date.

You will spend another 20 bucks for a veg and green salad. \n\nThe food is amazing, even the wedge salad was well planned and tasty. Every detail is appreciated in the establishment.

I made a reservation for 7:15. We weren't seated until 7:45. Then were told we had to choose from a limited menu- and no substitutions on sides. And each steak came with something different. I was told by the manager that we had been given wrong information. We should have left then, but it was getting late and we had tickets to a show.. Then the food took 50 minutes to arrive!! We had to rush through a very expensive meal, and asked for the check before we were even done. Everyone in the restaurant was very upset as they were dealing with the same issues. The food finally arrived, and it was very good, but overall such a bad experience I don't think I will come back.

But...and this is a big issue if you are serving high end steaks, they were not very flavorful and a bit tough. I order the \"cheffy\" medium rare and while perfect color...not very good. This was supposed to be a NY Strip aged and I am thinking it was aged since this morning...... Sides were good but not the official steakhouse \"you could never finish this\" size but tasty. The sides could not save the meal however. My wife orders her steak medium well so I usually discount any feedback from her on steak but she complained to the waiter about how tough her's was. Waiter apologized,  offered desert but she declined  I ordered a shot of Bailey's with my coffee and they certainly charged for that,  but i digress.

I needed a steakhouse before Coldplay concert and they were the closest, so I booked reservations and we showed up blind.\n\nBest blind choice I have made.  It is not an overly large steakhouse, has a more intimate setting, the staff are AMAZING and the food was fabulous.  There were 4 of us and we ordered for appetizers the seared ahi tuna with melon and the calamari.  The calamari has to be one of the best calamari I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, a lot of flavor and still so tender.  I didn't even need the dipping sauce, it was too good on its own.  The seared ahi was prepared perfectly and the blend of flavors with the ripe melon and salad was excellent.  It was light and tasty and perfect for summer.\n\nFor our main courses we ordered the New York Strip (thickest strip I have ever seen), The porterhouse (very generous), filet mignon and king crab legs.  EVERYONE cleared their plates, my son helped me with the crab, because the order was just too much for me, but they were SO good.\n\nOur side dishes were the onion rings, the special that night: bacon cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Everything was very good, but the mashed potatoes.. WOW, I could have made that my meal and have been very happy with it.\n\nI rarely note drinks, but the drinks here was especially good and worth browsing.

We had heard from our foodie friends Cynthia A. and Jo C. about Gallagher's and opted to look into their suggestion. Now, Cynthia A. knows her foodie chops and I trust her implicitly so when she told me to go there, I WENT THERE.\n\nDefinitely not disappointing! Mr. J and I (of course) ordered the rib eye for our main dishes with sides of the truffle mashed potatoes and a cup of the famous clam chowder for an appetizer. All were incredibly delicious and we gobbled them all up. I was so sad that I had no room for the highly-recommended bread pudding. No, literally, I had NO room left in my constricting dress so we had to go back and I had to change clothes to accommodate my now expanded girth. \n\nSo far, my favorite steakhouse anywhere. Extremely great value for the quality. Worth the experience and will come back for sure."

It was a Saturday night so the place was packed, the service was great! Our waiter was attentive and made us feel like we were the only people he was serving. \n\nI had the prime rib, medium rare, and the boyf had the cowboy rib eye medium rare as well. The meats were well cooked and delicious.  The prime rib was one of the best I've had. We had the cream spinach, it was  really yummy!\nThe blue cheese dressing they have is sooooo good! Order the wedge salad, its a must!\n\nI look forward to dining here again!! The prices are reasonable for a steak house. The sides are far less expensive than most places at $8-$10. \nDinner for two at about $140 (we didn't order alcohol). \n\nP.S.  There's this lady that walks around taking cute pictures of you and your date, she sells the 2 portrait album for $45, (optional, she totally walks away if your not interested)."

I'm not a huge spender on food, so 50 bucks is a pretty big drop in the bucket for me to eat, but overall I was very pleased with the food. The steak (cooked medium) came out perfect and was almost all meat (very little fat for a New York) and the onion rings were literally huge, not like the cheap kind you get at a fast food restaurant. Service was great. Our waiter happened to be originally from CA too, so he identified with a couple of guys in Vegas for the weekend and the food came out in a good amount of time.\n\nSure, I was dealing with a sick friend, and a overly drunk friend, both of who were bickering like preschoolers, but I enjoyed Gallaghers. Next time I'm in New York, New York, and have money to burn for a great dinner, I'll be stopping here!"

The waiter fails to mention that the salad he would be bringing, was a hunk of a slice of lettuce with miscellaneous items thrown over it, thus making it a salad! On top of that my lobster tail was twice the price of my steak. Last but not least, me and the boyfriend became severely sick.  The worst stomach ache and diarrhea known to man.  This was the last thing we needed to end our Vegas trip! We spent our last night taking turns on the ivory throne, pooping our lives away. We couldn't point out if it was the lobster or the steak.  The next day after having peptol bismol our stomachs settled and i had leftovers,  my boyfriend decided to take a chance with the steak again,  whaddaya know,  he's pooping his brains out once again.  Very bad experience and i don't think we will ever visit again.  Thanks for the overly priced laxative though."

There are plenty of venues to satisfy the raunchy-party side of you.  The night life in Vegas is just phenomenal.  Not too far off, if your disposition is in the spectrum of the more relaxing, affordable, family friendly experience, Vegas can accommodate you as well.  (Sadly) My recent trip to Vegas was closer to the latter.  \n\nWhile in Vegas, I definitely wanted to have a nice steak dinner but didn't want to pay a premium either.  There are plenty of steakhouses in Vegas associated with famous chefs and they are not cheap.  For some YELPERS they swear it's the best steak they ever had.  Believe me, I get it.  When it comes to steak and sushi, you follow the golden rule, don't skimp.  After all, which would you rather eat, steak at Denny's or Ruth's Chris?  You get my point.   No offense to Denny's btw.    \n\nSo how do I square the relaxing-affordable side with wanting a great steak dinner?  Simple, hidden in New York New York hotel, you'll find a gem of a steakhouse named Gallagher's.  This steakhouse is both understated and refined and I'm happy to admit, they cook a damn good steak.  I had the dry aged rib-eye with saut\u00e9ed spinach and for dessert - key lime pie.  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  I won't go into details of my dining experience except to say I was very impressed and the service was impeccable.  \n\nYup, in Vegas there's a steakhouse for everyone but I'm glad I went to Gallagher's.  My wallet was glad too."

The shrimp scampi was also very good, huge shrimp with very good flavoring. You also get bread while ordering the smaller dishes which was good for us being that we wanted something more on the light side before a show but something to soak up the drinks so that we could enjoy the rest if the evening.

Mine was done right, but my friend's was on the well done side. The difference was noticeable visibly. My view about steak is that while the meat quality and preparation does matter, the cooking process is most important.

My buddies and I decided that the night is too young to hit the casino floor and we were somewhat hungry so off we went to New York New York to try Gallagher's infamous dry aged steak. \n\nAll of us were alluded to the 21-day, dry aged New York cut, that raw steak dry aging outside of the restaurant was just speaking to us. We had mashers and Steamed Asparagus w/ Hollandaise for sides. When the steak was revealed, I was surprised how big a New York cut can be, it was almost like a Porterhouse cut from some steakhouses! My steak was perfectly made (medium), and upon first bite the flavor form being dry-aged 21 days is absolutely present. And the presence of that flavor is still apparent up to the middle of the meat, unheard off especially on less fatty cuts of steak. I guess one trade off with have a wonderfully flavored steak is toughness. Yes, this New York cut is tougher than the usual New York cuts I have had from other restaurants. That's some tradeoff because for me, texture is equally important as flavor in steaks. Also their steamed asparagus were overcooked, less apparent (but still overcooked) when our server exchanged it for a new one. The machers were simply delicious.\n\nCombined with my buddy's uber expensive Caymus prime red wine, our dining experience at Gallagher's was awesome. Yes, I would probably come back to check out the rest of their cuts, all of their cuts are aged (well, the rest are wet-aged) anyhow."

Even though dry-age steak that was placed in front of the store wasn't that special.\n\nIt's probably a 2.5 in my mind but I guess I would admit this was probably one of my least favorite steak houses i've been to in terms of their steaks. \n\nBread was served cold and you are given sour dough and raisin/nut bread. I prefer the raisin/nut bread. \n\nPrime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so. \n\nFilet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.\n\nDry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.\n\nThe sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette. \n\nMushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...\n \nPotato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must. \n\nCream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?\n\nRegardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party. \n\nI would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me."

Our server, Aris, was awesome and the rest of the people that helped him were extremely nice and courteous. The food was AMAZING and the price of the dry-aged steak could not compare to how huge the portion was. I couldn't even finish it and had to bring it back to the hotel. My husband then ordered tea at the end of his meal, while the rest of us ordered coffee. The server brought out a box with multiple choices of tea. The dessert was amazing, although I forgot what it was called. At first we ordered, one dessert, but it was soooo good that we had to order two additional servings. A must when coming to Vegas, next year again!!! Mahalo Aris!!!!"

When the moment of truth came, I just could not give high marks for it. Don't get me wrong! It's good. It's actually very good, and the service was excellent. But for a place like Vegas, where the world's GREATEST foods are suppose to be prevalent.... well, you get my drift.\n\nIf this place was in my home town, I would have definitely given 4 stars, but the fact that it's in Vegas, I expect a little more. So expect to get very good steaks.... just don't push that bar too high - maybe that was my problem."

I have never had a bad steak here (ask me my opinion of Pacific Dining Car), and the sides are top notch. I highly recommend the beefsteak tomato salad, much different than doing a regular salad.

Buy angus tenderloins at the grocery store, use McCormick's GrillMates Garlic, Herb, & Wine marinade with some added basalmic. Grill slowly until medium and crumble some fresh basil ribbons and parmigiana on top. Anyways...  you just expect expensive steaks at a steakhouse to be better than what you do at home, and well, they weren't. \n\nService was top notch, no problems there. \n\nOverall I can sum up the place in two words \"Nothing Special\" and if it is nothing special, then you might as well eat somewhere cheaper."

It was ok, far from what you'd get in the UK, but still ok.\n\nOh, the beer choices were pathetic.  I realize that I tend to go for more unique microbrews and there was nothing like that on the menu and for some reason I wasn't in the mood for wine.\n\nOverall it was good, the prices were pretty high---$70 for king crab and it's not a place I'd need to visit again on my next visit to Vegas."

            "review": "I was pretty disappointed with the quality of steaks at this steakhouse. I ordered the \"signature\" dry-aged New York Sirloin and my girlfriend ordered the cowboy ribeye. My steak was entirely unimpressive other than being slightly larger than I expected. It was seasoned well but it was hardly tender at all. I could barely taste the unique flavor that dry aging imparts on beef. Not bad enough to send back, though.\n\nMy girlfriend's Cowboy ribeye was poorly prepared. It's impressive size couldn't offset the fact that it was a tough, overcooked piece of beef jerky. The seasoning (salt, pepper, butter?) was spot on but I noticed something was off when i saw my girlfriend trying to cut through it like she was using a wood saw. I politely offered to cut it for her and this is when i realized that it was an awful steak. I tried a piece and was stuck chewing it for a good 2 mins. At that point I was tried to convince her that she should send it back. She has very little experience with steak and didn't realize how bad it was especially considering the $42 price tag...just for the steak. She decided to keep eating the dry rubber because it still tasted good but quickly became defeated after her jaw got tired...about halfway through the steak. You might imagine how frustrating it is to watch a server clear away twenty dollars worth of steak. \n\nWe also ordered a side of mushrooms for our steaks that were very tasty. The two things that saved the night from being a complete disappointment -and subsequently earning them a single star rating- was the service and the crabcake appetizers. \n\nThe crabcakes were amazing. EXPENSIVE but amazing ($20 for 3 small cakes). Moist, delicious, and piping hot. Seasoned to perfection. Probably the best crabcakes i've ever had. Seriously.\n\nThe service was very impressive as well. Super courteous and very informed. It was almost comical how aware the waitstaff was of the dining area. I accidentally dropped my one of my forks and - being the neanderthal that i am - was just going to wipe it off and keep using it. Before i could even reach to pick it up I had two waiters rushing to my side with a clean one. I saw this happen at another table later that night. They also scrape the crumbs off of the table using a barbershop-style straight edge. Good work guys!\n\nUltimately, I walked away very disappointed. After a generous tip I had spent nearly $200 for two people and felt a little cheated by the quality of their beef. Not recommended for steak. Everything was great."

And I waited...\n\n18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZB3upHZY )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfONNfAjyrc ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.\n\nENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.\n\nThe Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.  \n\nAlthough the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.\n\nThe true star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.\n\nWhen Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as \"other\" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.\n\nPerhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.\n\nThat my ChiaPet will not play fetch.\n\nThat I may not \"increase my bust\" by squeezing my arms across my chest...\n\nBut like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand."

The shallot bordeau sauce that came with it tasted like and had the consistency of canned beef gravy with a hint of red wine.  The side dishes were mediocre and even the bread seemed of store-bought quality.  What saved this from being a 2-star experience was my wife's prime rib.

The lamb was the only thing that salvaged this review from being 1-star. The lamb was cooked exactly as we requested. The steaks on the other hand were ALL totally off the mark. Two of my friends ordered their filets medium. One came out totally overcooked, like a hockey puck, the other \"medium\" steak was practically raw. I'm a fan of the medium-rare preparation, but this was extreme. When my friend asked for it to be cooked a little more, they sent it in and it still came back undercooked. He again had to request they cook it a little longer. The third time it came out overcooked, shocker.\n\nThis whole debacle was really disappointing.

When we walked in, I already had a bad vibe from the hostess. The quality of customer service wasn't there compared to Mastro's or even Ruth's Steakhouse. Once again, we had a 20 percent coupon so decided to try this place out.\n\nWe started on with their calamari. It was tender and nicely breaded although it seems a little limped and not crispy enough. The marinara sauce was the star of the appetizer...I couldn't stop eating it even after all the calamari was gone, I dipped the complimentary bread with it. Then we had the baby spinach salad but to my surprise it had blue cheese on it which I am not a fan. On the menu, it didn't explain what it came with but ordered it anyways. The salad was decent, nothing spectacular..it was just a salad after all.\n\nHubby ordered the dry aged sirloin steak with the side of mac and cheese. I had some of his steak and it was pretty good but didn't taste a huge difference from that steak to a Mastro's steak. The mac n cheese was a true disappointment; it lacked season and flavor. It seems like they finished making the mac n cheese before the steak since the cheese was not smooth but coagulated. \n\nGoing back to the service, our waiter probably came to our table twice to check in and a couple times, it seemed he purposely passed our table to go the one next to us. We had better service from the bread and water person. My water was always filled without me asking for it."

Very nicely turned out restaurant, helpful yet unobtrusive staff, unbelieveable food.\n\nFirst, let's get the one downer for this place out of the way... it's expensive.  Really good steak places are.  If that's a problem, you won't like it.\n\nOnce you get over that, be prepared to just sit there and groan for at least a half hour after you eat here.  The steaks are just that big and that good.   I'd recommend either the dry-aged New York strip (with bone, and about 2+ inches thick, plus look up dry-aging... it's incredible), or the Cowboy-cut Rib-eye (best rib-eye... EVAH, and at least a pound of beef).\n\nSides are also pretty nice.  We had the broccoli au gratin, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and mashed potatoes (can be skipped) at the table.  They were big enough for 2 easy and very tasty.\n\nThe staff was great.  At places this nice, the staff are sometimes just too eager to pump the tip and are constantly interrupting your conversations and groans of enjoyment.  Not true here.   Our glasses were never empty, but I hardly noticed the staff after we got our meal, otherwise.  Good job, guys.\n\nThe six of us spent about $450 with a few beers and sodas around the table, 6 steaks, and 4 or 5 sides.  It's not cheap, but if you're in Vegas for some good food... this is a great place to get it.\n\nOh, forget dessert, it's a joke you'll understand after you've stuffed the steak in your belly."

My dry-aged sirloin steak was cooked perfectly to my specifications, and was tender and juicy in every bite. It was nicely seasoned, and had a nice crust on the exterior. So what's the problem? Well, the steak seemed to taste awfully familiar to the steak grilled in my own backyard.\n\nI'm no steak expert by any means, nor do I claim to be champion amateur steak griller, but if I'm going to shell out $40+ for a steak at a restaurant, I typically want it to taste exponentially BETTER than the steak I make at home. At home, I usually eat my steaks with A1 sauce. Here, well the thought had crossed my mind.\n\nThe \"4 cheese\" mac 'n cheese was an extreme disappointment. I could hardly taste one type of cheese, as it was bland and lacked any flavor. The pasta was overcooked, and overall the side was just lukewarm, mere minutes away from being a cold dish. Our calamari appetizer was average, and it just didn't have that pipin' hot freshness. Although the outside breading was decent, the calamari inside seemed a tad rubbery. My wife and I did like the marinara sauce, which was so good that we kept dipping our breads in it.\n\nService was less than desired. Everyone from the hostess to our waiter seemed to give an overall vibe of \"blah.\" The 20% off coupon from the hotel was the saving grace, but I'd rather pay full price at other places like Craftsteak, Joe's Stone Crab, and the Palm. \n\nOr, I can always fire up the grill at home and bust out the A1."

The rib eye was huge, (18 oz.) and I was glad with my decision to share it. I always order my steaks medium- rare and more often then not they come out on the medium side instead of the rare side. Gallagher's however, did a great job at nailing the perfect medium-rare. For sides we ordered creamed spinach, broccoli au gratin and mac n cheese. All were fantastic but if you have an aversion to bacon for whatever reason, they put it in their mac. I however, love bacon and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nMy friend ordered the sea bass, which was their special and it came out quite overdone. We informed the waiter and he took it back immediately, but then shortly after proceeded to tell us thats how ALL the sea bass were coming out. We found this a bit odd but she settled on some salmon and he brought her an extra side of mac to make up for it.\n\nIn conclusion, Gallagher's is a very good steakhouse. Is it the best? Likely not, but I'll have to investigate a bit further to find out..."

I went on line and made reservations and requested a table for six near the kitchen so we could see the grill. Much to our surprise we were set up at the Chef's table. The Chef visited our table and provide great suggestions which turned out to be fantastic. The steaks are by far the best we have enjoyed anywhere in Las Vegas. This may not be for everyone but we love the action and the experience of a working kitchen. The food being prepared and the aromas are so great. I highly recommend a night out and great food and service at Gallagher's."

When we got there we were sat in the back in the corner , the lady walking by to take pictures walked by our table twice and didn't even acknowledge we were there. My husband ordered his steak medium well and I ordered mine  medium. His came more well done and mine was more medium rare... For the money we paid we thought we would get better quality.. Oh and the Cesar salad had whole romain leafs. We thought that was odd too.. Oh well we won't go back"

That being said, the food itself was just alright. I expect a good steak to need nothing additional, but my ribeye came with some type of sauce drizzled over it. I accidentally ordered mine medium well, when I meant medium/medium rare. They were more than willing to take mine back and re-make it, but I can't bear to waste a \"good\" steak. \n\nExperience overall wasn't worth the pricey items, so I doubt ill visit again if I'm ever in the area."

We were seated next to a lady who was dining by herself, but man everything this lady ordered looked legit. So I turned to her and said you are eating like a Queen! Apparently, she was some high roller that comes to Vegas every three months and she only eats at this steak house. We have dined at Craft, Heritage Steaks, and Del Frisco on past trips, so I was very excited to try a new steak house.\n\nPreston was our waiter and he was awesome! The next time we are back in Vegas I am asking to be seated in his section. He helped us with the menu and showed us what the more popular items were. We started with the crab cakes and the wedge salad. Both were delicious. Bread service came out and I really enjoyed the cranberry bread. \n\nFor our entrees we got the rack of lamb and the filet and lobster tail, along with a side of creamed cauliflower. Everything was devine! I was so stuffed, and literally for a split second thought I would need to skip dessert. That is until the high roller lady next to us got the sticky toffee pudding. And she saw my eyes on it, and said you had better order it because it's divine.\n\nAnd with that, we closed the meal out with the sticky toffee pudding and I did not regret the thousands of calories we consumed that night."

Solid steak dining experience located in the New York New York hotel and casino.  Only reason why not a 5 star review was due to the small portions compared to what you pay, and the glass they served my Macallan 12 year old whiskey was pretty dirty.   I was close to sending it back, but couldn't bring myself to be a borderline \"dinning snob\".  Since I had a nice ribeye steak the previous nite, I decided to try out their rack of lamb cooked med rare... as if there was another way to prepare it.   \nWhatever the spices used to prepare the dish, it totally made the lamb explode in your mouth.   The sides were good, but the bread pudding we had for desert was a let down.  The wife had their filet, and we added the lobster tail on our cuz's dish.  You be the judge... worth the price?

It is the Gallagher's Steakhouse which their NY location has just celebrated their 81 years of operation. We went to have dinner last night and left with a very delicious and happy experience! We started off with one appetizer to share. It was the chilled gazpacho. We both liked it as it is very refreshing to start off a meal. We ordered the house-aged New York Sirloin bone-in weighted 18oz and the 24oz Porterhouse. Both steaks were huge as expected. The steaks were cooked perfectly to our preference of medium rare. It is not easy to cook the big steak to perfection. My sirloin was so thick, but very juicy and packed with flavors. The side Yukon gold potato puree was very velvety smooth. The porterhouse that my husband had was delicious and juicy and tender. They gave you the bone marrow with crostini which is special. The side sauteed green beans were very good and tasted sweet. We finished more than half of the steak and took the rest home. But we still ordered the dessert. If you've been there, you will know how special their dessert menu. The special effect when they opened the menu....not going to say what it is or else it will take away that surprise for readers that have never been there. As recommended by the server, we ordered the toffee pudding. We normally just ok with toffee, but this was very different. A very warm moist toffee cake with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was just the right sweetness. We ordered coffee with dessert and it came in a silver pot and we both like the coffee to be that hot.  A very good memorable steak dinner for yesterday's special day for both of us!"

Seating was quick once the table was ready for our reservation. Staff was nice for the most part. \n\nThey recommend their dry aged new york strip and their filet. I asked if she would talk me out of the king cut prime rib. After looking at the menu online before heading to the restaurant, I was excited for the prime rib. It is not an item offered everywhere and I try to get it when the option exists. Unless, of course, she was going to suggest something else. She said she would not talk me out of it, and I ordered it thusly. \n\nI had a terrible piece of meat. It was riddled with fat that the waitress tried to tell me was \"marbling\". Excuse me, I am one of the few steak eaters who actually enjoys the true marbling. This was not the good stuff. She told me I had to get to the center of the steak to find the good part. I had cut all the way through to the center and was still unhappy. I suggested that either I had a very dull steak knife or my steak was a bad cut. She said they did have very dull knives at the restaurant. Yeah, I bet they do. Why would you want sharp steak knives at a steakhouse? \n\nShe came back after a few minutes and offered me a small cut of something else if I wanted it but I was too disgusted with my current meal to want any more. \n\nThe other entr\u00e9e ordered was the cowboy cut bone-in ribeye (what I should have gotten) and that was said to be good. Not the best, but nothing to complain about. \n\nWe had an order of beer-battered onion rings that were very good though they only gave you four on a plate. Their calamari was average and they give you a half a loaf of a sesame bread that was probably the highlight of the meal for me. \n\nAs long as I have the choice, I will not go back to Gallagher's."

For Appetizer we had the fried Calamari which is pretty good.  We ordered two New York steak In-Bone.  With onion rings and Bacon Chipotle Mash Potatoes.\n \nThe Steak is pretty big and tasty, each steak ran close to $50.  If you plan on getting the steak don't get any appetizer or it will be hard to finish dinner.  The seasoned Onion Rings are massive.  The Bacon Chipotle Mash Potatoes is awesome.\n\nPretty Expensive but well worth the Money."

It was even better than Lawry's.  Just go easy on the horseradish or you'll be making \"wasabi burning face\" in about 5 minutes like I did.\n\nMy wife got the filet mignon as usual and it was really meh.  Ruth's Chris serves a better filet than Gallagher's.  Sides were fine.  We got sauteed spinach which was nice and buttery along with the 4 cheese mac.\n\nService was fine.  I thought it was funny that the server really went out of his way to let us know off the bat that everything was a la carte.  \n\nAnd even though I gush about the prime rib, I never go to nice steakhouses to eat it.  You can do much better for an average price of $40 a steak elsewhere in town.  Craftsteak, Carnevino, Cut, Stripsteak, Del Frisco, Capital Grille and yes, possibly even Ruth's Chris would all be places I'd rather shell out my own dough to eat at than here.  \n\nBut you know what I'm ordering if there is a next time!"

I've been here 3 times already and each time has been great!\n\nFirst of all, this place is always PACKED.  Make sure you have reservations or you'll have a wait around dinner time.\n\nI've ordered the filet mignon twice and the queen cut prime rib once, and also have tried the porterhouse and the cowboy rib-eye (GREAT FLAVOR).  All have been superb, but I will say that my favorite is still the tender filet. Each time it has been cooked precisely medium-rare as ordered...which is often a difficult task even at some of the best steakhouses.\n\nThe one time I ordered the queen cut prime rib, I was disappointed after having such a great previous visit and ordering the filet.  Although the queen cut was a sizable portion (but not too big that I couldn't finish) they served me a medium-well to well (see pic), when I had ordered medium-rare. (I didn't bother sending it back cuz I was so hungry, just decided not to order it again in the future). The prime rib cut is on the thicker side and not quite as flavorful as prime rib I've enjoyed at other establishments that primarily serve prime rib (Lawry's or SF's House of Prime Rib). After that, I stuck with only ordering filet, which has been consistently top-notch.\n\nBEST SIDE EVER: seasonal mushroom medley!!  Unbelievable! You'll have to taste it to understand.\n\nTheir sauteed spinach and macaroni are great as well.\n\nDon't forget to save/make room for their creme brulee -- it's amazing!!!\n\nThis place is not your typical snooty, quiet steakhouse.  It's actually very lively, as everyone seems to be enjoying themselves in great company. Service was super friendly and attentive.  They checked on us regularly and we were never low on water. Only slight inconvenience would be that the restaurant itself did not have restrooms and you have to exit through the backdoor to use NYNY hotel's restrooms instead. However, that's really minor compared to the quality of food and service that you'll get here =)"

We wanted a nice dinner out after having grazed our way through the resort buffet, breakfasts that came complete with margaritas, pizza, and so much mexican food we were starting to say \"ese\" at the end of sentences. \n\nGallagher's appeared to fit the bill, although the raw slabs of meat in the case at the entrance are a tad off-putting. I know that they are designed to show you what you're getting, but I'm one of those \"ignorance is bliss\" people when it comes to eating animals. \n\nNevertheless, we came in, were seated immediately -- side note: next to the kitchen, like practically IN THE KITCHEN. I have never been so much IN a kitchen in my life. We were about 5 feet from the cooks and the grills. I think it was intentional: along the same vein of the exposed butcher case, so you can see what you're getting and where it's coming from, but it was distracting.\n\nOur waiter was very good. Made good recommendations, very professional and courteous. My mojito was excellent. I had a seafood sampler appetizer plate as my meal -- it had crabcake, shrimp, and calamari. The crabcakes were TO DIE for. The shrimp were good, and the calamari was fine, but not the best I've ever had. I wish I just got crabcakes. So delicious. I sampled some of my girlfriends steak and potatoes and they were just out of this world. \n\nService was superb throughout the meal; the servers came and cleared our plates quickly and then used that fancy schmancy scraper thing to clear the table of crumbs and such (I love that thing!).\n\nI would ABSOLUTELY 100% recommend anyone on the strip have a meal here.

The decor is classic NY steakhouse, with wooden panels and waistaff in black and white.\n\nI usually stick with the NY Steak and it generally comes perfectly cooked to order. I've dined with people who have also had the porterhouse and cowboy steak (both good for sharing ... actually, they're all good sizes for sharing except maybe the filets). \n\nThe appetizers, salads, and sides are not spectacular and is classic steakhouse fare (e.g., shrimp cocktail, iceberg lettuce wedge, creamed spinach, sauteed haricot verts, asparagus). I do enjoy the spinach salad. That's not to say they don't taste good, but just not beyond all levels of deliciousness. The sides don't really bother me because the focus is on the STEAK! (please see update below re mac n cheese!)\n\nFor dessert, I like to get their sticky toffee pudding. It's very moist, sticky, and delicious. Some restaurants who serve this classic dessert tends to somehow make the cake dry. The rest of their dessert menu is very standard types of desserts and not special (though, again, they taste just fine). But if you're in the casino, you might want to poke on over to Il Fornaio for one of their desserts!\n\nI can also count on the waitstaff for excellent service. I've never felt forgetten at this restaurant. The bartenders are also excellent and know what they're doing! Ask for a chocolate martini ... trust.\n\nUPDATE 8/17/2009: Went back recently and they had a new mac n cheese side. It is HEAVENLY! You must try it! Also, a few people told us a story about the sticky toffee pudding. Apparently, it was the recipe of the original chef and though he has left the restaurant, customers loved it so much that they asked him to allow them to keep the recipe. :)\n\nUPDATE 12/15/2016: Food is still wonderful and service is still amazing.

For a place that is as snobby as the staff were, I was surprised that they even had kitchen seating? I don't mind a nice personal view into the kitchen but this kitchen was a bit noisy and carefree on the fact that customers were placed there. So the ambiance of this place was not very impressive.\n\nThe food: They had the bone in filet as their special but they didn't work too much on giving it a good price to convince me that I wanted a meal that was preselected in sides and seasoning. I could build my own filet with double the seasonings for cheaper so I did that instead. My friends had bone in NY Steaks and another filet with king crab oscar.\nThe best meal was the king crab oscar filet. It did add a twist to the meat that brought out a different flavor to the entire meal. I have to agree with our waiter and state that it should always be served this way. As for my meal, I tried the peppercorn and onions. It was meh overall. The steak, of course, was good but only because it was a filet. The meat is already what it was and it being Gallagher's didn't add anything special to it so i will not give credit to the restaurant in this case.\nOverall, I would say it was a 4 star quality if it was based on the food itself.\n\nPrice: it was about average to be expected for a steakhouse. It was not obscene but it was not cheap. The perception of price is used in this establishment. An old marketing trick to assure that the hit to the wallet isn't visually grandiose; all items are a la carte. So you buy the items piece by piece. I enjoy the \"option\" feeling but don't think it's a fair trade value for those options in this case.\n\nService: Now this is where the stars fall off. Did you think I rated it poorly because I snobbishly didn't want to sit in the kitchen? oh no, I enjoy lots of different experiences and would have flipped a story to make the birthday girl happy sitting there as if we exclusively saw what goes on back stage. No, the service was extremely poor (overall). It started good actually, The reception were very professional, clean, and helpful. Loved it! The waiter was friendly and showed a lot of effort.\nHe came by and spoke to us, explained meals, specials, and drinks. As the night progressed, we saw less and less of him as well as not be able to ask anyone else for assistance. We started to wait for drink orders for over 15 minutes with no one in sight. So, about an hour in after ordering our meal, I flagged down some person with a suit that was headed to the kitchen. I only assumed because of the direction he was going...I mean, everyone else had a name tag and after I had flagged him down, I realized. . oh! he had no name tag. So I asked..sorry, do you work here? (perhaps a manager since he has no name?)\nHis response rudely was, \"Of course!\" with a duh attitude. I wanted to explain to him that he didn't fit the normal uniform and I didn't notice that he had no name tag. And at an upscale dining establishment. . . finding a man in a suit is rather common. I had a vest on myself and just a coat away from dressing better than him. But I shrugged it off as I didn't want to hold him back from where he was going. \nI inquired about our meal since at this rate of just waiting without any sign of our waiter, it may be another hour before we get to eat and will miss our show. I made the reservation for 7pm and had a 9:30pm show. We were hoping to grab a drink before it but spoiler alert, we finished dining at 9:20pm and had no time to look around the hotel.\nHe then proceeded to look down his nose to me and say that this was a true Italian dining experience and that I should have known this before booking this restaurant before the show. My issue here is that he started scolding me without even knowing the context of the situation or even talking with our waiter. This bothered me a lot. Is it true Italian style to wait for your drink for 20 minutes before they arrive? I think some Italians would disagree. I know I would get sober enough not to want another by then personally. i highly doubt our case was based on the theme of this establishment. I could rant on about more after this but this was the main story experience of this place. It's Vegas. Many choices and great options to partake on. \nGo elsewhere. I truly don't recommend this place. I regret not just going to StripSteak at the Mandalay but I wanted to try something new. \n\nperhaps the real Gallagher's in Real NY is better? I'm not sure. I surely don't want to find out when I'm in the area. I'll try other places as well."

You each order your own entree such as a steak which comes with nothing else so you all have to decide which sides you are going to share.  \nI had a NY Strip which was pretty good.....not worth what they charged for it.....for that much I'd expect the best damn steak I ever had......but nope, just pretty good.  It was tender but not very flavorful. Personally, I do a better steak on my grill at home.\nThe various sides we shared we all very good but with 5 of us you didn't get much of each since everyone wanted to try each one.  I could have eaten the mashed potatoes all by myself but had to settle for a spoonful or two.\nThe service was decent.  Not very personal but attentive enough even with a good size crowd in there. \nThey have a decent selection of wine and absolutely loved the Moscato.  \nSo overall impression, worth checking out if you can afford it or it's on someone else's dime, but so many other choices around where you can get a better meal for much less that I'm in no hurry to go back."

When I arrived at the restaurant with my guests they did not have a reservation for me although they did not say this directly to me but you could tell as they were trying to decide what to do. They then escorted my party of 6 to a table less than 4 feet from the kitchen area. Now this was not outside the door to the kitchen but we literally felt we were in the kitchen as there were no walls separating out table from the kitchen. If you could imagine trying to have any type of conversation never mind a business conversation when waiters and waitresses were rushing by, plates clanking, and orders being given to the cooks and orders being picked up by the waiters and waitresses. So now this was the atmosphere. In regard to the food I rate it a 7 on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best.. Not bad but not what I expected for the price atmosphere aside as this did not relate to the quality of the food. I travel to Las Vegas quite frequently on business and there are a lot of high quality restaurants to chose from. I'm sorry to say that based on my experiences this time (my first time to Gallagher's) I would not be coming back.\nI do hope this review is helpful and I tried to be honest in my report as when you do commit to a dinner in an upscale restaurant cost is not cheap. Will most likely never return based on first impression and experiences."

We had some friends in town over the Memorial Day weekend, and hit up Gallagher's Thursday night.  Very, very glad we did.  The table shared many appetizers, and in my estimation, the Maryland crab cakes, blackened shrimp and blackened scallops were the winners.  And, for $18 you got a very good size portion, 4 of each.  I would say the amount of food in the appetizers was atypical for a steakhouse.  The sear on the cakes was textbook, and the sauce was excellent.  Same with the scallops.  The shrimp were very large, perfectly cooked.  They are served over cheesy grits, but not too much.  Just enough that you can get bites of shrimp and grits together.  The blackening is fantastic, I think they should expand this and make it a full entree.  Very good shrimp.\n\nTo eat, I had the bone in ribeye, which comes with a load of fried onions.  This was a fantastic steak, the dry aging is really noticeable.  The depth of flavor is much greater than in other steaks.  A member of our party had the pork chop, which I thought was solid but dry.\n\nThe 4 cheese macaroni was a big hit.  The sauce is not too thick, but had excellent cheesy flavor.  The onion rings were very crunchy, but a serving only has 4 large ones as I recall.  Difficult to share, we had to cut a couple in half.  This would have been nice to know when ordering, we probably would have ordered a second helping to make sure everyone got a full ring.\n\nThe wine list was good, I would say average for a strip steakhouse.  Service was fantastic.  Very friendly and not overbearing. \n\nWill definitely return."

True, old-world, New York City style dining in the glorious (and super sparkly) New York, New York Casino - this restaurant is a must. My steak was a perfectly cooked Medium accompanied by the macaroni & cheese (yes to the bacon flavor!) and mashed potatoes (low on over flavoring - which matches the steak perfectly). Pro-tip: don't get sauces for the steak. It's perfectly seasoned. We were obviously looking for a waist-line friendly meal. (Ha!) \n\nWe also enjoyed the Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara wine country (started with a B but can't remember the name). The entire table split a bottle and everyone was pleased by the smooth taste (with a $48 price tag - not too shabby). Calamari for the appetizer (standard) and a Cesar Salad (it was ok but nothing special). The waiter was incredibly accommodating (my gf spilled her full glass of wine all over the table and my newly placed plate of above mentioned meal and they re-plated and replaced the sides immediately) and the overall ambiance was nice. \n\nNeedless to say we walked into Zumanity in a food coma which was oh, so worth it!"

It really was quite an experience. \n\nWe dined at Gallagher's shortly after seeing Zumanity. These two experiences equaled one really awesome night. \n\nMy meal started off with the soup of the day, which was cream of mushroom on this particular evening. I love cream of mushroom soup. This soup was just phenomenal. I would bathe in it if I could. The only bad thing I can say about it is it's filling. Naturally you should expect that from a cream based soup. I've been day dreaming about this soup ever since I ate it. \n\nNext was our steaks. We both ordered the fillet Mignon and I asked for mine to be cooked to medium. I also ordered the red wine sauce to accompany my steak. I checked the online menu to verify the information I was going to include in this review and didn't see the red wine sauce. Nor did I see the macaroni and cheese I seem to remember ordering as a side. I was enjoying some lovely Merlot while at Gallaghers but I don't seem to think I enjoyed enough of it to have imagined the red wine sauce and the amazing mac and cheese (which came with a \"cracker\" of melted cheese on top of it- yum!). So- they must have changed the menu a bit. \n\nAnyway, the meal was just heavenly. If I had to be picky I'd say my steak was a tad below \"medium\" but it was delicious so who the hell cares.

He is a huge red meat fan.. and I heard through the grapevine from some Vegas locals, that this is the best place for some good steak.  I will definitely make a stop here for an intimate dinner each time I go back to Las Vegas.  I ordered the Alaskan split King Crab legs and my date ordered the Cowboy Bone In Ribeye.  Both were amazing.  Our side was the Four cheese macaroni, it was so-so.  We glanced at the plates of our neighboring tables and noticed that everything looked yummy.  The service was superb... we never had to ask for anything and all of the workers were attentive to everyone.  There was someone making rounds for photos.. and we didn't feel hassled by her at all.  But we were celebrating a special occasion and ended up purchasing the pictures anyway, and she even threw in an extra picture at no charge."

Has been hooked ever since, I'm not sure if you will find the same quality oysters \"everywhere\" but it is a safe bet to say these are quite delish! \n\nThis is definitely a spot that comes to mind when you say, \"VEGAS\" I hear, \"GALLAGHER'S\".\n\nI recommend sitting outside with the piano bar view.

My wife and I stayed in the New York New York a couple of years ago but couldn't get in to Gallagher's the night we wanted to eat there without a 90 minute wait.  This time, I was able to walk in right away without a reservation.  I was seated behind a short wall that shielded the view of the rest of the dining room and was right next to the kitchen, even though there were a lot of empty tables in the main dining area.  Since I was alone I didn't mind the seating and I enjoyed watching the kitchen operations.  Had I been with my wife I would have asked for a different table.\n\nI ordered the NY strip steak, medium rare, saut\u00e9ed asparagus and the heirloom tomato with hearts of palm salad.  The salad was excellent and the steak was delicious but not as tender as I expected for a dry-aged prime cut.  Overall, the steak was cooked exactly as ordered, the sides were delicious, the cocktail (Bombay Martini) was perfectly executed, and the service was excellent.  I would eat here again and give the strip steak one more try."

But nonetheless the steaks are excellently prepared.\n\nWe were served all of the preliminaries (ex water, bread) promptly. To start out the hubby orders clam chowder, which he says was very good but, not as good as Chart House's. I order the spinach salad which contained sliced strawberries, watermelon, nuts, bleu cheese, and a very light dressing--too light, almost non-existent. I do not recommend this salad. \n\nWith our entr\u00e9es we ordered a very nice Pinot Noir by Macmurry Ranch. Our entrees were a filet mignon and a surf and turf (6oz filet and 1lb. of split king crab legs). Our sides included a sauce of shallots and Beaujolais and asparagus. Everything was amazing. Unfortunately we were so full we didn't have any room for dessert. We really wanted to try the bread pudding too! Next time!\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant but I do wish they served USDA prime. IMO they're just that much better."

It was nice, dark and overall was a nice environment but I did get the \"Outback Steakhouse\" vibe which would make me think twice before heading there for a birthday or anniversary occasion as I can be a bit of a snob with my environment if I'm paying a hefty price (quality over quantity right?). \n\nSat down and within 2-3 minutes had our drink orders taken and the drinks delivered.

Very bland vinaigrette dressing.\n\nI ordered a medium filet mignon. After I cut open the steak I found that it was served substantially raw. Despite my asking the bus boy 2 times to find our waiter, I waited for 6-7 min for him to appear (big, bald german). They recooked the steak and forced all of the juices out through the incision I created. My guest's ribeye was also undercooked; but he declined to send it back.\nAfter my second bite of steak I noticed that the restaurant was filling up with smoke. This continued  until the smoke became so thick that it was difficult to see across the restaurant. The line cooks were all cracking up over their broken ventilators. The restaurant cooks over coal or wood, so the smoke was noxious. Management did nothing proactively. They were content to watch all of their guests sit in a toxic cloud. Not being one to sit back and be taken advantage of, I told our waiter that we wished to leave immediately. He soon returned with a $0 check. 95% of my dried out steak was left uneaten."

The entire visit was very quick, but we never felt rushed, everything was right on time! \nThe waiter recommended a wonderful cabernet for me, which was in my budget, and was very courteous about it. \nI was felt like I was staring at everyone's meat on their tables! All looked perfect!\nStarted off with a wedge salad. Very classic, best blue cheese, and great fresh tomatoes. \nMy husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the lamb chops (both medium rare). I've never had lamb, so was nervous ordering away form the norm. But both were cooked perfect and seasoned perfect! Nice char on the outside, pink and warm in the middle! Would recommend if looking for a perfect steak of any kind!\nFor sides, we shared some mushrooms, very fresh and seasoned well. The brocolli au gratin was delicious as well. Sauce was fulll of flavor, but not too heavy! I have to try to make this one at home!\nDessert..... no room left, I didn't even look at the menu unfortunatly. \nThe prices were fair as well. I mean, you'll pay for a good steak, but  nothing outrageous. Total bill with tip was still under $200, 2 people and drinks."

I liked the salad, it was a bit more dressed up than the usual wedge and was a nice start. My steak was cooked to a good medium rare and was also seasoned well. It was a giant steak but a good portion of it was inedible fat. All the sides were pretty good but the mac and cheese and the mushrooms were by far my favorites.

I don't know where to begin, but this place was such a disaster.\n\nService was horrible and slow. Extremely slow. So it was Thanksgiving night and they were busy, but it wasn't a full house in the restaurant. Our server (I guess I'll be nice and not mention his name) was never around. I think we only saw him 3 times. The first time was when he took our orders. Then he disappeared for an hour. We also waited over an hour for our food. He finally zoomed passed us right before we got our food, and then WE had to flag him down to get some drinks. The third time, he brought us the bill. Horrible. The guy who refilled our waters provided better service! \n\nThe food wasn't too great in my opinion. The bread that they served us in the beginning was too hard and the butter was pretty frozen. I ordered the center cut Filet Mignon. The glaze on top of it was tasty, but the rest of the steak lacked flavor. It was also kind of dry. The bottom line: it needed salt. I also ordered the seasoned jumbo steak fries as my side. The seasoning made them taste weird. I couldn't really figure out was it was but it did leave a spicy after taste. The steak knives that they gave us were very dull as well. My husband and one of our friends ordered the dry-aged New York Sirloin. They both said it needed salt. Our other friend ordered the queen cut prime rib and enjoyed it. So at least one of us liked our food. \n\nFYI - the bathroom is a hoax! You open the first door with a sign that says \"restrooms.\" Then it leads you to a second door with a sign that says \"restrooms.\" When you open that door, it leads you to the nearby restrooms in the casino. LOL.\n\nThe bottom line: Not recommended and the steaks need salt. You know its bad when you have to have salt, A1, ketchup, and whatever else to make your steak edible!"

The waiter was soon at the table with ice water and to take a drink order quickly.\n\nAfter finding out the weights of the various steaks. I didn't want 18+ ounces in a steak so I ordered their \"signature house-aged bone in sirloin.\"  I ordered it cooked blue.  I also ordered a side of the Special Spud.

The server brought my iced tea and it was kept filled throughout the time I was there.  The steak came and it was done exactly the way I like it--nice grill marks on the outside and cold, red on the inside.  It was a good steak.  The Special Spud was very good, probably the highlight of the evening which isn't necessarily a good thing when a side is what you remember your dinner for.  The sticky toffee pudding was good, also.  It came with some whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\n\nService was attentive and pleasant from the time I was greeted at the door to leaving.

The d\u00e9cor here has that feel of an upscale NY dinning establishment.  It's a nice high end feel but comes at a price of that they really pack you so that you're really close to your neighbors and that the acoustics of this Gallagher's is lousy so you have to really speak up in order to talk to the people across from you.\n\nThey had our reservations and was able to show us our seats within minutes of arriving.  The menu here is pretty basic and what you would expect from a steakhouse, appetizers such as crab cakes, shrimp or crab cocktails, and bruschetta ranging in the $8 -$12+ range and a range of steaks such as filet mignon, porterhouse, prime rib, and a couple of chops and seafood selection ranging in the $30 - $45.  Also, sides do not come with the meal, so for your veggies, potatoes, and macroni you're looking at spending an additional $6 - $10 each as well as they have 3 sauces to choose from at an additional $2 each.\n\nI decided to get the filet mignon medium and my friends got the prime rib and we decided to share the mash potatoes and the broccoli au gratin.  My friend also got clam chowder which he thought was ok.  When we got our meal, I have to say portion size, I was impressed.  The \"queen\" size prime ribs were huge, my filet mignon was the size of my fist.  The mash potatoes was pretty small, just barely enough to give each of us 1 spoon full, and the broccoli was a decent size head covered in cheese.\n\nLooking forward I cut into my meat and the first bite, over cooked.  It was closer to well done and maybe even a medium well, then a medium.  As I ate my meat, the cooking was so uneven.  I would say only about 15% of the filet mignon was cooked to a medium, the rest of it ranged everywhere from rare to well done.  It wasn't even like it was just the center that was rare, it was just unevenly cooked everywhere.  The only place that was consistant was that the outside was well done.  The pieces that were cooked to a medium was very good and very tender and you can tell the meat quality is there, just the cooking was almost criminal to waste a good piece of meat like that.\n\nMy friends also had the same problems.  One got his prime rib medium well, and it was cooked well done.  NO pink to the meat at all.  My other friend just liked the outside with the seasoning and didn't like the center.  They also didn't serve the horseradish or au jus sauce with the prime rib and I know you have to pay extra for the sauce (personally at these prices and paying ala carte, they should just give it to you) but not giving them the au jus to go with the prime rib is a major faux pas.\n\nThe sides we ordered were good, probably the small portion of mash potatoes was the best dish of the night.  Very creamy and looks like they put it through a blender to get out all the lumps.  The broccoli, well it was a nicely cooked piece of broccoli with some high end cheese melt on top, it was good, but nothing special.\n\nThe service here was friendly for the most part until one of my friends asked to take home his prime rib (he probably only ate about half his food) and it got into this long and weird awkward moment with one of the waiter's assistant asking if he was sure he wanted it wrapped and asked him several times until he finally got it wrapped.\n\nThe total bill came out to be about $175 including beers and tips.  Honestly, for that much money, I didn't walk away feeling impressed with Gallagher's Steakhouse.  For the prices you pay for, the cooking quality of the steaks should be much much better.  The ingredients are there, but if you have a guy who can't cook a piece of meat evenly, let alone to a medium, or even know that a medium well prime rib has some pink to it, you're just wasting your money Gallagher's Steakhouse.  High quality ingredients and portion size can only hide so much, you still need to be able to cook.  I would save your money and go else where, 2 stars for Gallagher's Steakhouse for their high quality ingredents and not much else."

Gallagher's was definitely the best option at NYNY so we didn't mind at all.\n\nDry aged beef lines the front of the restaurant, enticing the naive passerby to come check out their selection of prime cut steaks and chops.  Vintage pictures of stars and athletes line every bit of wall space that the moderate sized restaurant has to offer.  The relatively low ceilings and minimal windows create the appearance of a classic New York style supper house.  \n\nWe arrived a few minutes before our reservation so I decided to jump on the shoe shining seat and have a good old fashioned hand shoe shine.  He made quick work on my shoes and I walked off with a seemingly brand new pair of kicks.  We walked in and it was surprisingly pretty crowded for a Sunday night.  We sat down near the rear of the back room, which sounds bad but it's actually pretty nice and quiet there and also it was near the door that leads to the restroom in the hall so it turned out to be a good spot.  \n\nOur server quickly greeted us and brought water and bread to our table.  We were torn on entrees and she was very eager to offer up some suggestions from her personal picks.  We agreed on the Ribeye and Rack of Lamb with sides of jalapeno mash and mushroom medley.  We also ordered the Crab Cocktail to start us off along with a bottle of a nice Chilean Red.\n\nCrab Cocktail - Basically 3 sections of King Crab served with lemon and cocktail sauce.  No work necessary since it was sliced in half lengthwise for us.  Delicious.\n\nMushroom Medley - Great earthy side.  Not much to this so order if you love mushrooms.\n\nJalapeno Mashed Potatoes - Cheesy potatoes with a slight kick (very slight)   Salted perfectly and not too much cheese.  \n\nRibeye - For me, a ribeye is a ribeye so unless you overcook it, the only thing left is the size of the cut and this cut was huge.  Served on the bone, this is not for the feint of heart.\n\nRack of Lamb - The star of the show.  Served medium rare is the key to perfection.  Basic seasonings along with a good sear makes lamb one of the best cuts around.  No different here.  Soooo good.  None of that mint jelly mess or paper booties needed.\n\nWe had lots of leftovers so we took some to our room to store in ice.  We also took some olive bread as well.  Great leftover lunch the next day.\n\nWe had a great meal here for a not-so-expensive price tag.  It was really good.  We would like to try some other cuts the next time we happen to be around here.\n\nOh, and there's a lady that walks around taking pictures if you would like.  She comes back with like sets of pictures that she prints out and places in photo folders.  I felt like it was high school grad or prom or something.   We got to choose 8x10 or 5x7 or wallet size.  Lol.   We ended getting just one picture in 8x10.  Felt bad but she shouldn't have printed them all out without asking what we wanted first.  For better profit margin, get a digital photo frame and show all the pictures to the customer so save money on ink and paper.  Nothing wasted except battery life.  But i digress..."

Must be around 20-24oz, it is just thick.  It's always grilled perfectly.  That first bite, when the fat from the steak just melts in your mouth... is just the best.  I never get any sauces or condiments to go with the steak since I think they season the steak so well that nothing is needed.  Having grilled with the bone gives it that extra flavor too.  Better than any steak I've had anywhere.\n\nAs for sides, that's the only downer.  All the veggies are pretty much sauteed and drenched in butter.  It's absolutely delicious but at the same time... it just might be too much.  Mashed potatoes are nothing special and mac & cheese isn't that cheesy to me.  Caesar salad is big pieces of romaine lettuce with grated parmesan reggiano.  Nothing special but the croutons is crazy good.  I can eat a bowl full.  Also got to try the fried calamari this time around.  Pretty damn delicious, especially with the marinara sauce.  But really, if you come to a steakhouse, the only thing that matters is the steak!\n\nLocated in NYNY, the steakhouse looks like a classic steakhouse from NY with the decor.  You would think it would be loud since it's right next to the casino floor but its more from the patrons that are dining and the high ceiling.  Make reservations, cause it's not big at all and it can get full fast.\n\nIf you want a lot of steak, order the Cowboy steak.  It is huge, just huge."

He also very arrogantly replied to our question when we asked to share an entry - saying that it is the busiest night of the year and guests must order full entries.  When he brought our wine and mineral water for spritzers, he literally said: \"here you go, please mix it yourself, because I don't know how you want it\".  Not to mention that we felt very rushed as they were taking our plates away.

You'd think for a $38 steak they could get it right. I will say the cuts were nice and think (14oz), but the flavor wasn't anything I haven't already tasted at most steak houses. The asparagus and yukon gold mashed however, were very very tasty.  Another person in our party got the surf and turf and the filet was very small. There was also a hair in their side order of mushrooms (we were given free creme brulee for this). It was an okay experience, but for the price ($500 for dinner for 6 people without alcohol), I'd expect near perfection."

Strange. \n\nAs for the food, I wanted to order some appetizers first but we were rushed into ordering main entree. But it all worked out because I could enjoy my cowboy ribeye fully. The steak had good flavor to it and I didn't feel completely bloated even though I ate two third of the steak. The steak had a light spice on it.\n\nAs for dessert, their dessert menu lights up like an iPad. I tried their dark chocolate. That was nice and smooth."

While my parents and I were hanging out in the New York New York enjoying the piano bar, walking around waiting to see a show we stumbled across this place and had to eat here! They were very accommodating. We were able to make reservations right then and there for when we got out of our show that night.\n\nEverything was awesome from the time we sat till the time we left. We shared clams casino as an app.   My father and I each ordered a dry-age 14oz NY strip steak and a 3lb main lobster! And my dads lady had a dry-age filet with a Australian lobster tail. Soooooo yummy. They even de-shell your lobster at the table for you so you don't have to get all messy cracking shells! Apparently the chef didn't like the looks of my lobster tail so they brought me another whole 3lb lobster! Eating like a queen! I ended up have left overs and had a great breakfast the next day! Their bread is pretty good too, I loved the wheat with raisins in it. We didn't order any sides because who needs sides to fill up on when you have a plate full of steak and lobster to get threw! \n\nIf your not looking to spend any where from $60 to $140 a plate then don't stop here. But it's well worth the $140 we paid per plate for just steak and lobster! I'll be back if I'm ever back in Vegas or NYC!"

I also relied on this yelp page to make my food decisions, but now I think I shouldn't put so much faith on some of the information (LoL).

Yea, I could've eaten at the actual restaurant, for dinner, around 9pm, during the Electric Daisy Carnival weekend, and pay a lot of tips.... but I chose to do take-out to the comfort of my hotel room-Player's suite and the best move of my trip =]  (Order take-out at the bar, bartender was great!)\n\nOrdered lamb chops done medium-well (my mom can't take pink Lol), 2 clam chowders, a mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese with pork belly, a bread basket to go. It was around $80 and it was the best $80 spent. Lamb chops were extremely tender and juicy and well cooked and came in 3, clam chowder was slightly salty but full of clams, mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular, and mac n cheese were creamy and cheesy. =] \n\nTill now, I still can't stop thinking about those lamb chops... I want some NOW! =[\n\nAnywho, 5 stars for the meat, 3 for the sides, bread and butter is cool 4 stars LoL... I will be coming back for you Gallagher's! I will be coming back...."

I don't write many reviews but felt compelled to do so for this one of kind authentic steak house. Everything from the drinks to the main course were absolutely mind blowing. \n\nOur entire vegas trip was made worth it based on this restaurant alone. The waiter advised is to share a potato because they were big. Good advice. I'm can put down a lot of food but no me and my wife were perfectly satisfied with sharing the potato. The appetizer was a stuffed mushroom. Yes one mushroom. It was massive and like nothing we had ever eaten before. Not sure what all was in it, but we were sad to see that last bite go away. I came here to look up their menu because I had the best beer of my life there. Yeah they don't make the beer, but that was my first experience with one of the IPA's they had on tap that the waiter recommended when I asked. Even my wife liked it, and she isn't in to beer.  It was ballast point sculpin if you are interested. Anyway. If you want an amazing steak dinner in Vegas. Don't pass on gallaghers."

We could care less (truth be told they were actually quite funny), but I could see if you were on a date, or just wanted a relaxing dining experience how this might ruining your nite. The manager discretely came to our table and without drawing attention or placing blame on other guests, simply asked if we would be more comfortable in another room of the restaurant. I thought that was considerate and showed diligence and attention on the part of the management staff.   But we declined - we are a large law enforcement family and felt strangely comfortable.

Unfortunately our friend was staying over the road in the MGM... which is like a 10 mile walk away! (ok, not really - but seriously how big is that place?) \n\nWe turned up without a reservation at about 10pm and got straight in. We shared a starter of bruchetta and i'm glad we did because the mains were huge. The two boys had the recommended steak and I had a huge fillet of Salmon. Tasty and delish all round.

The crab cake (3) appetizer was fantastic, fresh and almost completely crab. The bread was fresh and complimentary, would've liked it better served warm.  We had the wedge salad  presented nicely with heart of palm and baby tomatoes, blue cheese dressing was good. I had the dry-aged, bone-in New York sirloin.  It was perfectly cooked medium rare, averagely tender.  It is served with a sauce on it, which I could've done with out.  I feel a steak should speak for itself, and if it needs a sauce then it's not a great steak. My wife had the pork chops, and we didn't eat them.  They were very tough with almost no flavor, very disappointing! The mushroom medley was terrific, and the colossal baked potato was definitely that!  \nThe best part of the dinner was the staff.  Very professional, attentive and friendly.  We were given the opportunity to replace the pork chops, but we were so full we declined.  So thanks to Roberto and Mike! Great job guys!"

The sides and drinks were the highlight of the meal. (I got a Gallagher74, I think that's the name-it was awesome as was the broccoli.) Our server was decent, the bussers were wonderful, the manager was phenomenal (tall white guy, short hair, super friendly) and we had a reservation so we didn't have to wait. The steak? Mediocre at best. They're specialty is NY strip- the toughest, most flavorless cut of beef. So, I got the rib eye, as did my boyfriend, since we both like some marbling- it was ginormous, but mostly \"marbling.\" My boyfriend said, \"I've had way better steak for a quarter of the price.\" Me: \"When?\" BF: \"When you make it at home.\" To be fair, I think they grill their steaks and don't let them rest before serving, which takes away a lot of flavor. Also, I like a warm pink center, so I ordered it medium well, it came out medium rare- not okay when you're paying $50 for 1 steak. The meal was definitely not worth the $250 we paid."

Why had reservations for 11 people and 1 got sick so we told the hostess that 1 was sick so there would only be 10. One problem, she miss understood and thought that we said that there would only be 6. So we go back to our table and guess what it's a 6 top. No problem they said wait here and we will reset the 10 top. This is when all goes wrong. The hostess come back and starts BITCHING at us that we have to go back up front and can not wait where we are as it is pressuring her staff. Now we are far enough back that if we did this the table would be done and we would turn right back around and come back. With us is my 72 year old father who has trouble walking so we are not going anywhere. The hostess proceeds to keep bitching at us in a voice that is getting loader and loader to the point that her own staff is turning backs to her because they are embarrased by her behavior. I find the manager and mention to him what the hostess did, his response, well she is a valued employee who has been with us for a long time. Wrong response. That one line cost them almost $4000.00. How? We do a dinner in Vegas twice a year for 40 customers and the average bill is $4000.00 we have been looking at switching off restaurants and the food and service were good enough that we would have moved our August party to Gallagher's, but not now. Great Food, Great Service. Just avoid the blond hostess at all costs"

The crowd that night was a mix of families, business crowd and romantic lovers. \n\nWe all ordered different entrees (salads, calamari, bruschetta, crabcakes) shared and devoured them. \n\nHoly Horseradish, wow the prices for steaks made me pause real quick. This is pricey. The taste proved otherwise, as I had the filet med rare. '\nEveryone enjoyed their entrees. If you order seafood, they have no prices, so it varies on a daily basis. \n\nI had the four cheese mac as a side and was NOT disappointed. \n\nThere is no formal dress code at Gallaghers either as everyone else was wearing whatever they wore touring the strip."

We didn't have to wait for our table but did have to ask the hostess to move us to a larger table (my husband is 6'7) obviously the average 2 top doesn't cut it!! The waitress was a very kind lady from Hawaii and the clam chowder was awesome but unfortunately that's where the pluses ended. Both steaks were dry and next to flavorless and the asparagus side dish was underwhelming. The decor was blah and I feel that we were over dressed :/ (I like to dress up for nice dinners).The drinks were strong, the calamari was decent but that was about it. As far as price is concerned I don't feel it was overly expensive. $43 is about average for a steak on the strip, I'm not sure what else would be expected. We are locals and won't be back and this place won't be recommended. We like the kind of steaks that don't need A1!! lol"

I struggled so hard to cut the steak I even knocked off some of my sides.  I had a few bites which actually tasted ok but gave up eating because it was too much work.  He never came back to check on us and when he finally did show up I asked him about the steak and asked was it tough because it's aged?  He said no and if you had told me about it I would have changed it out for you but it's too late now.  Yet he never came back to check on our table so I did the best I could do with the steak I had.  I was so worried I was going to get ill after eating it. \n\nLet me backtrack a minute where when I ordered a drink it came in a glass with lipstick on it and now I couldn't even cut my food?  $200 wasted.  Trust me, there are way better steak places out there don't waste your money there!  The sides we shared.  We had mac and cheese it was good but not thick and creamy, green beans were very good and that's basically what I had for dinner, and bread."

We also split the stuffed mushrooms, which tasted great. \n\nFor dinner I had the signature dry aged strip, cooked medium. I also had a baked potato on the side. The strip was cooked excellently, and the flavor was very good. I have not eaten a lot of dry aged steaks in my life, but I certainly enjoyed this one. \n\nThe service was excellent as well.

Flavor was buttery with a nice taste due to the aging process. Very tender.. even the fat was good.\n\nThe Caesar Salad was average, but the wedge salads were pretty good.

Where to start.....\n\nWe had a last minute reservation for 7:15, and were seated promptly in the very back room, tables packed in and noise level was like a bar.  We could barely have a conversation, which really detracts from any sort of dinner.  Our server was nice enough, but the guy filling the water and bringing out the bread had a really bad attitude.  He threw the bread on our table, knocking one of the knives off the bread plate.  Brought our water, when I said \"thank you\" he just walked away, he appeared to be like that with every table around us.  Then a lady taking pictures came over and asked if we wanted our photo taken for a fee.....um no.  I don't like being solicited while at a dinner that is going to cost upwards of $200, the first time she came around I was polite, but then she came around again, that time I was not so polite.  If I want a pic taken I can get out my phone or camera for free!\n\nI ordered a couple of cocktails, they were fine, but could have had a little more alcohol in them.  I am paying $11 for a drink, I expect to taste the booze!  We had the king crab cocktail which was good.  My husband ordered the Cowboy steak medium rare, it came out almost raw in spots.  He likes them very pink and bloody, but this was just plain raw, he gave me a piece and I could not even eat it, he found a piece I could try and it wasn't even that good.  I ordered the fish they had that night, I think it was snapper and that was good.  After tasting his steak I was so glad I got the fish instead!  I have a general rule that if I am at a steakhouse I order steak, but in this case, I think I made the right choice.   For sides we got the broccoli with cheese sauce which was good, but for the amount of sauce that was on them I should have just ordered the plain broccoli as there was hardly any sauce on them.  We also got the mashed potatoes which were good.   \n\nI wish we would have just gone to Delmonico, which in my opinion cannot be beat and is our go to steakhouse while in Vegas, or even The Palm which you can count on for good service and food.  Needless to say, we won't be going back the Gallagher's, which we only went to because he happened to be staying at NY NY."

But changing their \"signature\" dish was really a bad idea."

(This is not the place for an intimate dinner or quiet conversation). Our waiter was a kick and generally added to the fun. The steaks were great and the side-dishes decent. My only complaint: Does everything need to be \"super sized?\" Most of us were unable to finish even half of our steaks, they were so large, and it just felt plain wasteful - especially since our puppy couldn't make the trip to Vegas with us. :) It would have been nice to see some \"petit cuts,\" for those who have a more reasonable appetite. In any event, highly recommended for a fun evening and a good steak."

Upon our recent dining engagement, I was rather disappointed at the amount of \"charcoal coating\" that covered our steak!(unlike our previous experiences)  Every bite of our steak was accompanied by bitter crunchy charcoal that coated our steak! My son had to literally scrape off the charcoal coating off his steak! We brought this to the attention of our waiter and he never apologized but did say that is how they ALWAYS prepare their steaks (ummm no!)..and rather  embarrassingly pointed out another table that steaks had arrived at and said \" Look sir, these steaks were prepared the same as yours\" ...very unprofessional to put me on blast in that dining setting! This experience was rather disappointing because We truly & absolutely enjoyed dining there in the past! But with so many Steakhouses to opt for in Vegas, I believe that was our last! I must commend the hostess that was very welcoming and polite!"

You can easily cobble a veggie plate together, and our server was super helpful guiding me through my options. I had steamed asparagus, onion rings, mashed potatoes (yukon gold puree), a caprese salad, and the mushroom medley. They are large sides -- I finished about half. The potatoes and onion rings are particularly good. Vegans would struggle here, but if you're a vegetarian, flexitarian, or pescatarian, you'll have plenty of choices.\n\nThe drinks weren't all that impressive. They have a decent bar, but the night we were there (May 2013), their bartender had a heavy hand with mixers. The glasses are a little small and the glassware feels light. The wine we had with dinner was fine, but not all that remarkable. They clearly make their money from the steaks not the booze.\n\nI was *very* impressed by the service. They were attentive, but never pushy. We didn't feel rushed or pressured. One server here sees my dad every time he's in town -- and has met my mom, my sister, and me over the years. She remembers him and always makes a point to check in with him when he comes in to eat. It's the level of personal service you'd get in a small-town -- something pretty remarkable in Vegas.\n\nThe decor is very masculine, with lots of dark wood, big booths, and dark green leather. Think British sporting club. It's nice, but not stuffy. It felt like a dressy steakhouse you'd find in Des Moines.\n\nSure, the beef here is the steaks -- but they have more going for them than mere meat."

We let the waitress know and she was super helpful; she let us know that the majority of the main courses offered took about thirty minutes to prepare, so pretty much everyone ordered appetizers except me.  I ordered the special, which at the time was Mahi-mahi - I figured fish would cook faster than a steak or something like that. Best decision I have ever made. The waitress continued to check on our food and us to make sure we would be able to enjoy our meal and get to the show on time, and let me tell you - so worth the wait and the rush. BEST FISH I HAVE EVER HAD. It had some sort of maple glaze/sauce on it and it was simply to die for.  Everyone else was immensely satisfied with their meals too.

As soon as we stepped into the restaurant, we gave the hostess our name and got seated right away. \n\nThe first thing they served was the complimentary bread. The cranberry bread was bomb. My roommate and I didn't want to stuff ourselves with bread before the main dish comes out, so we didn't have much. As for appetizer, we got the portobello stuffed mushroom and caprese salad. I'm love mushrooms in general, so it was amazing for me. The portobello stuffed mushroom was really big considering that it was an appetizer. I want to say it's the size of a palm of a hand. The caprese salad was really good and different than other caprese I have tried at other restaurant. The caprese was extra soft and fluffy.\n\nAs for our main dish, I got the filet mignon and my roommate got the $60 porterhouse (since it was her birthday). We both wanted our steak to be cooked medium rare, but when the food came out, I wanted to say it was a little more on the rare side. We didn't mind so it was okay. As for my filet mignon, it was perfect! I thought the size was pretty small (in the..circumference terms?) but it was super fat and tall..if that makes sense. My roommate's porterhouse was crazy!..in a good way. She enjoyed it so much. But I wouldn't recommend for a girl/woman to order it unless she has a big appetite. It was bigger than an average woman's hand. My roommate couldn't finish it but she said her's was very juicy and fun to it.\n\nSo for our steaks, sides weren't included so we had to order separately. Each side ranges from $7-10 if I can remember. We got the cooked asparagus and creamed spinach. The asparagus only comes with 5 pieces, but they are huge and fat. As for the creamed spinach, it was enough portion for the two of us. I just thought it was a little too creamy for me.\n\nThe service at this restaurant was great! Our server was super duper nice. My roommate and I were actually going to order more, but our server was nice enough to save my wallet and stop us. The food came out really fast, so that's a plus. \n\nWe didn't get any dessert because both of us were way too full, but I did see the table next to me had some key lime pie. So maybe I'll try that next time. This restaurant is definitely on the pricey side, but I do give it a five star because the food was worth every penny. I would definitely come back and bring my parents or other friends."

My husband and I each had a cowboy ribeye along with mac and cheese, green beans, and a baked potato.  Best part of the meal was the green beans.  The steaks weren't that tender and the mac and cheese was bland and soupy.  This was our fist time eating at a nice steakhouse.  So I'm wondering if steakhouses are overrated, or if it's just this place.  Either way we will probably stick to having steaks at home.  Oh and if you are planning to see Zumanity afterwards, they don't allow food in the theatre so think about that if you are planning to take home any leftovers.  The atmosphere, service and drinks were good.  The food was average."

He was really knowledable about the steaks (I wanted to know which was the softest.)  I ordered a lemond drop which was the most fabulous lemon drop I've ever had.  I ordred a New York steak, my husband ordered the Cowboy Sirloin or something like that.  I should technically have given them 4 starts since they mixed my medium with his medium rare, but that being said within minutes of us letting them know, the manager was at our table apologizing for the mistake (they took my m.rare and cooked it to med) and he offered us each a dessert on the house!! Like I said, phenominal customer service.  I would definitely go back to this place.  Great drink, great food, great people!\n\nOne recommendation to those who havent been there: The steaks are enormous!

I am a HUGE believer in providing outstanding customer service especially when it is YOUR job and you get paid to do it. These people here, go above and beyond. They know their job and do it very, very well.\n\n\nI went to Gallagher's for a work dinner and we were lucky enough to be greeted (once we arrivede at our table) by the Executive Chef. He hand picked a couple of our appetizers for us and made us feel completely at home.\n\nWe were served the cold and hot seafood appetizers and almost everything on these two dishes were spectacular. Everything except the fried calamari. It was a bit greasy, a tad bit over cooked and the breading didn't want to stay on. Still good needless to say. The jumbo colossal shrimp on both plates were to die for. On the hot platter it was drizzled in the most amazing sauce. Shrimps on both platter were so sweet and succulent. Crab cakes on the hot platter were the perfect size and the crab legs on the cold platter were split, easy to eat and so very sweet.\n\nWe also had bruschetta which was neither here nor there for me. It was fine but didn't blow me away or anything. \n\nI absolutely loved my porterhouse steak and while I love my beef, most yell at me when I order mine medium well. Pink is good with no blood for me please. But even though I had it cooked a little longer than medium rare it was still tender and juicy. One thing I was extremely shocked was how well seasoned the meat was. I didn't taste nothing more than salt and pepper but it was just perfect. Enough seasoning to compliment the meat and not cover the flavor of the steak itself.\n\nThe bone marrow that comes with the porterhouse was a HUGE surprise to me and a good one at that. I was drooling when I was eating it and enjoying every minute of it. I had only wished I had more. It was that good. \n\nThe asparagus here have the most perfect Hollandaise sauce I have ever tasted in my life. The sauce was bright with lemon, buttery, smooth and the way it coated my tongue left me in heaven. \n\nWe also had a mac and cheese but it was overpowered by the bacon in it and I wasn't a huge fan.\n\nThe Yukon gold potato puree was good, not great. A bit too loose for me but all the cheese that was in made up for it.\n\nDecent wine list. Strong mixed drinks. \n\nExpensive dinner to say the least. But I didn't have to pay for it. ;)"

The service is spot on, the busboy was on top of everything. \n\nThe food is good, no complaints. This is a true steakhouse, how you order your steak is exactly how it comes. Some chain restaurants tend to overcook the meat slightly, so be aware, medium rare here is medium rare. \n\nWe started with a stuffed portobello mushroom. It was tasty, to be honest it tasted like the ones I cook at home. Perhaps they were peeking in my kitchen. \n\nWe each ordered a filet mignon and shared a side of asparagus between the two of us. I believe this is the way to go at this restaurant. It was plenty of food. Everything is \u00e0 la carte. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to order as mentioned above. They were good steaks, but not wow I've never had a steak this good.. good. \n\nWe finished with a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. My favorite. It was creamy in the middle with a perfect crust on top, just as it should be. \n\nWe went with two other couples. With gratuity included (party of 6 or more), our bill per couple was slightly over 200. Not bad. Of course we had a beer each and an after dinner drink. I think the food served was worth the price, based on quality cuts of meat and the skill at which it was cooked. However, I think for the price I may be able to find something with more of a wow factor for me."

Upon our arrival we were kindly greeted and escorted to our small table in the far back. The feel of the restaurant was semi- business casual/slightly romantic. Our waiter took about 15 minutes to come back with the wine menu. By the time he came back, we were ready to order our wine, appetizers, bread and meal.\n\nAppetizer: The bread was very hard- may have been stale, but we were hungry. The butter did most of the job. Nothing too special. We also ordered 4 oysters $3.50/ea. Very small, but fresh and tasty. The oysters were accompanied w/ half a lemon and a teeny-tiny tabasco sauce bottle. \n\nEntrees: Boyfriend ordered the dry aged New York Sirloin $40 (sides must be ordered separately). The steak was medium rare, just as he ordered it. It was perfect! Full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Did not need any type of sauce. I think it was one of the best pieces of steaks I've had, but boyfriend's had better. He ordered steamed broccoli ($8) and the colossal baked potatoe ($8). The broccoli was soft, tender and delicious. It didn't need salt, butter or anything. It dissolved in your mouth. According to boyfriend, the baked potatoe was nothing special. He could've gone without ordering it. Both sides were very large portions, each side is enough to fill at least two people. I, on the other hand, ordered the cesar salad ($8.95) as my main dish because I knew I would enjoy a piece of boyfriend's steak. The salad was fresh and good. It had shaved parmesan cheese and home made ceasar dressing (at least it tasted homemade).\n\nI would definitely return to this place. We had excellent, attentive service and a great meal. We didn't think the meal was too expensive either. Our total bill was slightly over $100.\n\nBy the way, beware of the lady who comes around to take pictures. Some people get annoyed with her. She will take several pictures with your permission and sell each large photo jackets with two pictures for $45 (if I remember correctly) and $15 for the wallets. We bought them because they came out great. They're just too pricey."

The six or seven bites of meat I had without the fiber were very tender and well seasoned.  We shared an excellent key lime pie for dessert, but the coffee my husband ordered was really weak-he ordered an espresso and poured it into his coffee to make it drinkable.

He carved every shred of meat from the bone and when he was done, pointed to the bone and said \"I'm gonna miss you.\"  I've eaten a lot of steaks with this guy and that was definitely a first.

The meal was delicious as expected, but they went above and beyond to fulfill my dumb request which was fantastic.  The birthday boy is a big Superman fan and while filling out my reservation online I had asked for an autographed picture from Supe.  When we arrived at our table there was a photo of Superman wishing him a happy birthday and autographed by the man himself (I'm sure, lol).  While I wouldn't expect every request to be fulfilled this was just a pleasant surprise that jolted our night from good to great fun."

All 4 steaks came out not even close to as ordered had to be sent back.  I've never seen anything like that happen.  They were all ordered medium rare, and came back medium well.  To their credit, they comped us on one of the steaks, but that was because the 2nd time it came out it was also medium well.  The waiter was really embarrassed by all this.  We also ordered 2 bottles of wine, and one of them was spoiled.  I know that might not have been Gallagher's fault, as sometimes you simply get a badly corked bottle, but given all that had happened it certainly didnt help.  On the plus side,  I had the prime rib and it was quite good, although certainly not worth $32.   The mushrooms I ordered were also good and the calamari was absolutely delicious.  However, given all that went wrong I would certainly never go back again.  It really was the type thing you'd perhaps expect at a restaurant where the prices are $16 per entree, not $36 per entree."

My sister had the dry aged sirloin, which she liked, but was comparable to the other steaks, we didn't see any major difference flavor or tenderness wise, except that it was more lean. For sides we had mashed potato's, asparagus and creamed spinach. Everything was great except the creamed spinach which had way too much nutmeg. Probably the best steak I've had since the last time I was here, which was over two years ago!"

I'm just a little late is finishing my review. \n\nIf there is one food type that I love in this world its steak. I was excited to finally tryout the famous Gallagher's. The Vegas location is quite cramped but the service was very good. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying. I ordered the Filet Mingon. The food took an incredibly long time to come out. We sat for 45 mins before we had our first bite...that's just unacceptable. When the steak finally appeared it was one of the worst steaks I have every had. It was like they cooked the filet on medium heat because it was very tough. There is no excuse for a tough Filet. It was chewy and didn't have much taste to it. I was very disappointed. I make better steaks at home, so I certainly expect more from a dedicated steak restaurant. I will never be returning. I would rather go to Ruth Chris' or Gordon Ramsay's The Steak, where they know how to properly cook a steak.\n\nYuck!"

I can't say that it's much like modern NYC, but it is very similar to many older and lovely San Francisco establishments. The aged steak was very good and worth the money. However, it does come on the bone and has fatty portions, so if that bothers you, please just order the filet. They are very similar in price and I find that there is no making up for those preferences. You will enjoy an un-aged filet much more than an aged new york strip.\n\nThe asparagus was excellent, it is so often overcooked.\n\nThe roasted garlic with the steak was a nice touch.\n\nThe medium- \n\nThe salads were a good size but in faux fine dining tradition, it is up to the diner to wrestle with enormous leaves and hunks of lettuce. Perhaps this is to your taste, but as I actually wanted to finish the salad, being served whole leaves in copious dressing was unfortunate. I ordered a Caesar, the dressing was nice but for $9 I expected something a little more robust. No anchovies were harmed in the making of my salad. My partner ordered the wedge and gave up after a third, although he liked it.\n\nI was not impressed by the hollandaise. For the price ($2 additional) and quantity it was acceptable, but the white vinegar was very pronounced and the sauce was thin. They attempted to correct the acidity with shallots, it didn't really help. The consistency was fine otherwise.\n\nThe wine list was decent but a little spare on by-the-glass. Bottle prices are average but by-the-glass was a bit more expensive than similarly priced restaurants. The pour size is standard, about 5 ounces. For a party of 3 or more, I'd just order a bottle.\n\nThe bad-\n\nVery misleading reservations. The restaurant was in no way full at the time requested but they forced us to reserve at an earlier time. \n\nGuidance about ordering is lacking and the staff and kitchen may be at war. Although still lovely and tender, it was the single most done medium-rare I've ever had in my life, including my own occasional barbecue-related sins.\n\nDid not try-\n\nThe beer or cocktails. I didn't even see a drinks menu other than the wine list.\n\nOverall-\n\nGood food, a touch pricy, and I'm not sure how much I believe their schtick about aging. The location is not thrilling, it's in a particularly irritating part of New York New York. Wait-staff was very nice, hostesses less so. Worth a trip, but skip the soup/salad."

Instead of the swank and haughty vibe that many Vegas restaurants seem to specialize in, Gallagher's is friendly fun.  Dress ranges from slightly casual to casual elegant.  \n\nThe service was decent (though not outstanding) and the server was able to provide good advice.  Prices are on the high-end but the portions are as large as the steaks in the window, which means, they are TOO large for a single person (even the smaller portioned steak is too large for one person).  The quality of the food is top-notch though Ruth's Chris does better steak.  I'll definitely return when my need for meat finally resurfaces after being much sated by my meal there."

For years I've been stopping by this hotel (and I even stayed here once in college), but always completely missed this Manhattan-like strip.\n\nThere were several restaurants, bars and delis that had that New York feel (sort of like you get in the Paris hotel for Paris). \n\nWe got to hang around and grab a beer here, but we had already eaten dinner. The staff was friendly (and funny) and they had an epic all glass meat refrigerator out front that made me wish I could have grabbed a steak here.\n\nWe got to sit \"outside\" in the \"street\" and people watch.

It had just enough tang. \n\nAnd for the main course we both ordered the aged NY steak and they were so juicy with a nice smokey taste. We also ordered a side of their sauteed green beans. THIS IS A MUST! The green beans will suprise you. I'm not sure what they sauteed them with, but it was just SO GOOD. They were a perfect compliment to the steak. For dessert, we got the lemoncello flute which was basically a lemon sorbet, but so much better! It was very refreashing. \n\nOverall, it was a great night out and I think it's well worth the money."

It is definitely not cheap, but the steak you get is huge, probably even enough to share between two people. The taste and texture were on point, and although I realize that having the bone in is what makes this a classic, the tendons in mine were quite stringy and made the meat harder to separate in some parts. So I'd probably say the price is more for the amount of steak that you get rather than the quality of the cut (maybe this isn't as true for other items). Assuming you don't mind using your hands a bit, you can probably get more of the meat than with just using your knife and fork. I'd probably prefer to pay a bit less for a smaller and easier to eat cut of steak though."

The restaurant is located in the New York New York hotel and aside from the meat locker that can be viewed from the \"street\", its a nice restaurant. Not too upscale where people can't afford a meal and still gamble, but still pricey enough and well catered too that you feel like you've been treated.  Being with all our friends really made this experience great, but the staff and food were excellent as well.  I ordered a glass of wine, but for some reason I liked my bf's wine better.  So, my waiter replaced mine with a new glass of the same wine my bf  was drinking...very cool.  I ordered the special, which was salmon  served on a spinach bed and was so tender that the salmon basically melted in my mouth.  I sampled some other people's dishes: lobster, fillet mignon, lamb, and ahi.  All were delicious.  The only thing I didn't like was that you had to pay for all your side dishes, which I hear is standard of a steakhouse, but why?  Somethings I just don't understand, especially when you are paying 30 plus dollars for a dish...what's so bad about having them put a scoop of mashed potatoes on your plate?  Meh!\nThey did bring out 2 birthday desserts for our friend's who were celebrating their birthdays.  Also, it was very close to where we all needed to go to see Zumanity (an awesome show, must see if you are 18 or over, hint hint).  Overall, I had a good meal and had a great time.  Definitely a place to scratch off the list of places to eat in Vegas, not particularly one I'd have chosen but proximity to our show beat out all the other places...oh, and accommodating 14 people in short notice."

It was 75% inedible, tons of fat and hardly any good meat. \nWhen I asked to speak to the manager in private (didn't want to damper the reception), the young manager came to the table and proceeded to get into an argument with us. He said it was our fault and that most of the steak was eaten. He even went so far as to say we didn't know our steaks and should have ordered a filet instead. After 10 minutes of trying to discuss this away from the table, he said he would comp one of the steaks. But when the bill came, he didn't. \nIn the day when there are tons of restaurants to choose from, times are tough, he should have been more accommodating to his customers who were spending almost $2000 on a meal for a special occasion.

It's my favorite restaurant in town. \n\nWhen I get in steak debates with people, I insist that they come here with me. I'm more than happy to buy them a meal (avg. plate about $45 pp)  to show them what dry aged meat can be. Gallagher's nails it with perfect broiling. I usually get the cowboy ribeye. Despite being almost the size of a dinner plate, it's always impeccably cooked.\n\nThe texture of the steak is what will win you over. Tender, soft-cutting, and sooooo easy to eat. A medium cooked ribeye from Gallagher's is something I daydream about. You'll see. \n\nAll of the sides are incredible. And huge. My favorite are the steak fries. Forget what you're picturing in your head: this is a HUGE baked potato, quartered lengthwise, coated with spices and served with a killer spiced ketchup sauce. \n\nAlso try the pork chops (huge) and just about any of the desserts. Creamed spinach is also very, very good.\n\nAgain, this is my favorite place to eat in a city full of great eateries. Don't miss it."

Our calamari appetizer was prepared well (not rubbery) and the dipping sauce was zesty, but not overpowering. I had the tuna medium rare and my date had her steak prepared medium. Her steak was very tender and flavorful. My tuna was quite good and the plating was excellent (even those dining nearby commented at the excellent presentation). I wish I had taken the suggestion of the server and had the tuna rare, but you live and learn. The highlight of our meal was the sticky toffee pudding, which was the perfect end to a superb meal. The staff was very attentive and fun, as our waiter predicted my date's dessert selection. The excellent food and staff is reflected in the bill, but worth every penny if you're looking for a pleasurable dining experience in New York New York"

So we were really disappointed when our dinner was not real good and took nearly 3 hours. We had wine and appetizers to start, a \"seafood celebration\" that everyone loved ( $38.00 per person but worth it) and then we ordered our main courses. We all had steaks and it took nearly 45 minutes from when we ordered them to when they showed up.. The restaurant had cleared out so it wasn't an issue of being overly busy, when the steaks arrived they were all barely lukewarm and the sides were basically cold. It was pretty obvious that they had somehow sat for a period of time before being brought to our table. I mentioned to the manager on duty and his solution after having to \"think it over \" was to first offer us new meals ( it was past midnight by then so no one was much interested in waiting around for another round) and then offered to bring us some desserts and after dinner drinks ( more food and drink but not offering to do anything about getting a lousy meal) .. Our bill for 4 people was $620.00 and , although we are completely ok paying that for a special night, what we got was such a downer it would be hard to not remember this the next time we visit Las Vegas .."

I agree with a few of the other reviews - this is not prime it taste like USDA at best - the meat is tuff and not flavor full & once again the meat was not cooked correctly (2 steaks ordered the same and 1 cooked to order the other not)\nBottom line.

I promised myself that the next time I return, I'll throw a ridiculous bet on the hardway's with a couple of black chips in hopes the dice will hit the 10-1.  Haha, well don't get too excited cause it didn't happen, yet, that is...BUT instead I scored something just as good as I was kidnapped to celebrate a quick birthday overnighter in Sin City and to finally try one of Gallagher's steaks. \n\nSo why this place...?\nDry-Aged beef is what we're talkin' bout peeps...that's right, not sticking a piece of meat in a vacuum-sealed bag that apparently also \"ages\" faster and in hopes to trim and reduce its water weight, hence the controversy of why very many steakhouses don't use the classical dry-aged process. As we all know time is money. Catch my drift...? \n\nAt Gallagher's, its old school \"aging'...We're talking countless hours and days of beef being stored in a special dry-aging cooler where a complex chemical reaction process that involves an intricate equilibrium of time, temperature, and the right humidity so that the beef's enzymes begins to break down and tenderize the meat. In return, Gallagher's delivers to you one of the utmost tender and most flavorful steak you'll ever eat. BOOM! \n\nThe Eats:\nMain Course:\nDry-Aged New York Sirloin $43 \nCowboy Rib-Eye Steak $45     slightly burnt edges (-.5)\nSauteed Wild Mushrooms and Carmelized Onions $2 each\nYukon Gold Potato Puree $8  meh. (-.5)\n\nAmbiance:\nDim lighting, tranquil noise level, semi-formal attire (Sported a Hawaiian shirt =P)\n\nCustomer Service:\nProduct Knowledgeable, Friendly and Professional.\n\nTip: Make reservations.

It is a wonderful restaurant with better prices than many other steakhouses & I was very happy with our meal.\n\nThe bf & I decided to both start with the clam chowder, get macaroni w/cheese and the mashed potatoes with garlic & herb.  We also wanted to split an entree since I don't think either of us would have been capable of eating so much meat on our own.  We decided on the the king cut prime rib...and soon found out that we should have chosen the queen cut to split.  =)\n\nThe Food:\n-Clam chowder = heaven!  This is REALLY good clam chowder.  It's a giant bowl of rich, creamy chowder full of clams and potatoes.  I absolutely loved it even though it seemed pretty heavy on the clams (more so than most places)\n\n-Macaroni & cheese = disappointment; this was honestly the low point of the meal.  I like mac n' cheese to be smooth and creamy but this was clumpy and solid (not saucy).  There were 2 little pieces of bacon in it but we didn't care for this much at all.\n\n-Garlic & herb mashed potatoes = delicious!  I loved these super creamy mashed potatoes...the garlic flavor was perfect.  It was a special for the night but if they make it available to you, you should order it!\n\n-King cut prime rib = ginormous slab of beef!  It was quite good but in my mind, I wasn't expecting it to be so large.  It's bone-in and I'd say about two or two & a half inches thick at least.  The meat was really juicy and tender...you could probably cut through it without a knife.  Had a nice, earthy beef flavor to it & I thought it was great.  The bf thought it could have used a little more seasoning to it but if you're one of those people that really like the flavor of the meat to come through then you'll be very happy.\n\n**We split the king cut & there is no cost to do a split = awesome!  I know a lot of other restaurants charge some sort of fee but it's really wonderful that here it's not a problem.\n\nOur dining experience was wonderful - our server was very attentive, cheery and helpful to us.  The total came out to around $76 for the two of us which is very, very good in my opinion for this type of restaurant.  Gallagher's is known for their dry-aged steaks and I saw many order this...and I would have ordered it as well but it looked like too much for me to eat.  I say definitely give this place a try...the NYNY Hotel is sort of loud but inside the restaurant it's actually very quiet.  It's small so I'd make a reservation.  =)"

There is a sign next to it that explains all of the steaks served at Gallagher's is first wet aged for x amount of time and then dry aged for x amount of time.\n\nI assume most passersby are doubly impressed by this.   My reaction however, was that - 1. The marbling on these steaks are not impressive   2.  They wet age first then dry age?  Why not just do dry aging for the entire process? Why even advertise this when it actually shows that you've gone the \"cheap\" route?\n\nSo, I order the Dry aged New York which came out overcooked.  I ordered medium rare and it came out medium.  Not only was the steak overcooked but it was DRY.  It was actually unbelievable as even when I half-heartedly cook sub-prime steak it doesn't come out dry   \n\nMy friend's steak also came out overcooked.\n\nI sent the steak back and got a new one....it was cooked correctly this time.   The actual flavor of the steak was not that great which i guess is ultimately the REAL problem.  It had an odd gamey flavor to it that is sometimes apparently in dry aged steak but never really in this unappetizing way.\n\nThe sides and appetizers were all unexciting and the service was sub par.  Our actual waitress was decent but the bus boys were pushy and seemed like they were in a hurry the whole time.    They just dropped the plates in front of us and constantly tried to take our plates away even though we weren't finished yet.   It's like they were in a hurry to get us the hell out of there.\n\nOverall, I would say this place is below average in the world of \"Fine Steakhouses\"\n\nI would recommend Mastro's Ocean Club if you wanted steak in Las Vegas"

The waitstaff is professional, attentive and formal, which helped to raise the the classy vibe of the place. \n\nDon't fill up on the bread (delicious as it was)-- you're going to need to save all the stomach space you can for the fantastic cut of meat that will soon be coming your way. It's been about a week and I think I'm still full from this dinner.\n\nThe Prime Rib of Beef was fabulous. Our server told me it was a \"Queen Cut\", which is about an inch thick. This is the thickest prime rib I've ever seen! It could have easily been split between 2 people. Toward the end of dinner, I was completely full and just had to sit there and stare at it for a good 10 minutes to convince myself I had enough room for another few bites.\n\nThe texture was great. At first bite, I thought the flavor was good. After pouring the au jus all over it, I was in love. The au jus had a beef or vegetable broth flavor to it. It was very unique in comparison to other au jus I've had in the past. I'm not a huge fan of fat on my meat/steak, but the fat was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth good. \n\nThe mac n cheese was good from the few bites I had of it. I was more focused on trying to take down my giant cut of Prime Rib.  \n\nAdded bonus: $10 cocktails! Score! Good price for Vegas hotel restaurant/bar. Another bonus-- This restaurant is right by the Zumanity theatre-- very convenient if you're trying to catch a nice dinner before the show. Reservations definitely recommended."

Everything was cooked perfectly and the sides were great compliments to the main dish. \n\nThe staff was very polite and there was no wait for a table (given we went to dinner on a Wednesday night, but still..).\n\nThe only down side may be the location of the bathroom facilities. You have to walk out a door on the side of the dining room to get to the restrooms and then walk back around to re-enter the restaurant. Needless to say, I got lost for a few minutes, but I eventually made my way back in.\n\nNevertheless, a great dining experience!"

The cut was so thick (or maybe it was due to a different reason) that it wasn't as tender or as melt-in-your-mouth flavorful as I like it.  I was kind of surprised, considering it's a top steakhouse.  I could barely eat half of it, which I was thankful for since I didn't overeat and wasn't in pain like everyone else.\n\nSides:  Sauteed mixed mushrooms (turned out to be just button mushrooms and cut up shiitake mushrooms in a wine sauce).  They were tasty, though the menu was kind of misleading that they would be a better variety of mushrooms.  Creamed spinach (really creamy, a little bitter for me, nothing special).  Four cheese macaroni and cheese (non-hollow penne-like pasta swimming in what reminded me of a thick cheese soup -- I liked the smoked gouda addition and the texture of the pasta, which was almost like gnocchi, though).  I didn't try the asparagus in hollandaise, which looked really fresh and perfectly cooked.\n\nThe chocolate-zin dessert port I had for my after-dinner drink was really delicious.  I had never seen that offered anywhere before.\n\nSo 3.5 stars for my meal.  But I tried my boyfriend's steak (the dry-aged NY sirloin specialty of the house), and the crust on that was so flavorful and fantastic.  Not 5 star fantastic, but really really good.  The porterhouse, who was ordered by a friend who'd tried it a couple of years ago and had been dreaming of it ever since, made said friend very happy and quiet.  This time it was served with some bone marrow and roasted garlic to spread on the steak.  And a friend who ordered the filet mignon said it was like butter.  \n\nI know my co-diners would give this place much higher ratings based on their meals, but I wouldn't go here for the prime rib.\n\nNote: Interestingly, the last time I was in NYC, I came across the huge dry aging room that is viewable from the sidewalk at the original location.  I thought it was awesome, especially since people were working inside (the one at NY NY is much, much smaller).  Did you know it was America's first steak house (1927), created and named after a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer?"

The meat portions are huge so that made up for it's price of $45ish. \n\nThe lobster tail was quite dry and lacked a lot more natural flavor than it should've and the reddish seasoning on top didn't help at all.  It cost me 75 bucks alone!! Yes, it was a big lobster tail, but it sucked.  In hindsight, I should've said that it sucked to see if my server would remove it from our check.  However, he didn't ask how the food was, and I felt generous that night or something. \n\nThe mac and cheese side dish was bland as hell. Chef Boyardee could put out a better dish, which is really, really saying something.  \n\nThe best part was the green beans which were very well seasoned and very tasty but way overpriced for what they were.  The portion was modest at best but cost us something in the teens.\n\nI must admit that if it wasn't for their lavish display of the process of dry-aging steaks in the glass enclosure right outside their restaurant, I wouldn't have felt tempted to eat there."

I cannot imagine how anyone could eat this by themselves without having a lot of leftovers. We didn't have a fridge in our motel room, so that wasn't an option-- but we cleaned our plates and left feeling full but not miserably so. The steak was so tender and flavorful- it did have some fatty pieces as ribeyes are known to do, but I gave those mainly to my husband to eat. I tried a piece and it melted in my mouth, but in general I usually don't like the fat. The crispy onions on top were fantastic as well as the small side of greens that came on the plate. We got our with horseradish and it really sent the meat over the edge.

            "review": "It's Vegas. I'm a SoCal native and Vegas is ALWAYS a weekend option especially since it's only a few hour drive away. Minus all the obvious reasons one of the big attractions for me has always been food. Whether it's finding the next best buffet, a unique cuisine or just some top notch high end restaurants all concentrated into a small area. One thing I try to always do when getting into Vegas is to find a new steakhouse. Well this time around I was recommended to Gallagher's. \n\nFirst off it's a welcome change to enter a steakhouse not feeling out of place with everyone dressed up as if they were going ballroom dancing. We were seated for a table of eight. It was quite early and we had a 8PM dinner reservation. We are all meat eaters so our table had center cut filets, new york sirloin, queen cut prime rib and for myself the cowboy ribeye steak. Minutes later they came back to tell us they ran out of prime rib. I mean it's barely a quarter past 8pm. Whatever they proceeded to change their order to a steak instead. \n\nBut back to my steak. I like it \"Black and Blue.\" Now there are some places that I will make sure they know what I'm talking about but these type of high end restaurants with this high of a rating I would imagine they would know. Also my server took my preference without skipping a beat. Normally if the case I will be asked for an explanation if they don't know. When brought out of course it was clearly not black and blue but it was rare. I told the server that this was not \"Black and Blue\" and that it was rare. She proceeded to tell me \"That is how OUR black and blue is.\" What the hell does that mean? Now I can eat my steak medium rare (normally cheaper or skinnier steaks) and I can eat it rare also but it's my least choice. The funny thing was that she didn't even offer to send it back to have it redone, she instead stared at me with a long pause as though to say, just eat the damn thing. I hate sending food back, possibly fear from the movie \"Waiting\" and stories from friends. So I just kept it. It tasted like wet beef. It's almost as if they kept it in a bucket of water overnight threw on the grill and slapped it on my plate. For my side I had creamed spinach which was more cream then there was spinach. This is a first also, I did not finish my steak. Blasphemy!!! It was simply that bad. You might be thinking hey you got it rare, well shoot I've had it rare many places and have loved it. \n\nThe highlight of the night was simply the spirits menu which was a lit up menu that at first I thought it was a touch screen but it wasn't. The wine was excellent that was chosen by the server but do not remember the name, simply because I was so upset about my meal. Everyone else had similar opinions being average but nothing spectacular. \n\nWhen it comes down to it the food was not even ok. I'm surprised this place is still here with so many steakhouses popping up in Vegas now you can easily walk down the street and find another prime steakhouse. The two stars is almost out of sympathy since the only reason the second star is there is my wine and scotch. Either way it's hard to want to give this place a second chance again since there are so many other options available. Maybe once I've exhausted all other places and I make my rounds again I might give this place a try if I'm stuck at NYNY or have won a few black chips while at the table."

When we were there this past week, we ate at quite a few big name restaurants on our visit but was craving a great steakhouse.  I asked a friend to suggest a great steak while we were still in town so here is my two cents.\n\nThe ambiance was loud and alive, reminiscent of a traditional Chicago steakhouse, minus the sound of the casino.  When I ordered wine for our table of 6, our server (Caroline), was very suggestive about wine pairing with each course as we progressed through our meal, which I really enjoy and find a great part of the culinary expirience.  Our server was also great at answering all questions that my guests had regarding portions, ingredients and even answered questions regarding my wife's allergies.  She was pleasant and well informed.  Top notch!  \n\nFor starters, the group started out with the crab cakes and calamari, which were very good, as were the wedge salad and roasted baby beet salad.  A couple of us had the clam chowder and said it was rustic and hearty in style.\n\nMany of us ordered the bone-in dry aged NY steak that she suggested and everyone at the table commented how cooked perfectly there steaks were cooked considering almost everyone ordered them cooked differently, we are a nightmare in restaurants!\nOther's had the Colorado lamb and commented how nice it was that it was not New Zealand lamb which tends to be a bit gamey and alot smaller chops.  My wife had the Irish organic salmon and loved it, as her allergies were looked after.  Thank you.\nWe tried many of the side dishes and they were all very good as well.\n\nAll in all it was a very fun evening, the food and service were great!\nWe don't have a Gallagher's here in Denver, so I'm thinking we have to hop over to Vegas more often!"

My group of four was quickly seated in a quickly filling dining room after we arrived for our dinner reservation, and I immediately went to work sampling attractive menu offerings.  \n\nA Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail sported excellent meaty shrimp accompanied by a zesty horseradish-based sauce.  Next was an equally tasty Spinach Salad with Warm Bacon Dressing that contained large chunks of bacon and Red Grapes.  Paired with the salad was a complimentary Bread Basket that held a Baguette, Olive Bread, and Sourdough Ciabatta that was just sour enough.  \n\nNext up for me was a Center Cut Filet Mignon with Wild Mushroom Sauce, Brandy Peppercorn Sauce, and B\u00e9arnaise Sauce along with a Colossal Baked Potato that was truly huge in size. and enhanced by add-ons of bacon and chives, while Diane enjoyed bacon and cheddar cheese with her giant spud.  The potato was cooked perfectly, and my 8 oz. steak was buttery, flavorful, and perfectly medium rare.  All of the sauces went very well  with the meat.   I left no leftovers on my plate.  But Diane could not finish her 14 oz. New York Strip.  When it was boxed, the remaining Sourdough Ciabatta went with it!.  \n\nThe food here was expensive but worth it.  Surf & Turf was running $125.  Service was very good, and caring.  And the ambiance deep in the bowels of New York New York was that of a clubby classic steakhouse."

I ordered the roasted chicken cooked with a butter sauce, but it was so plain and unflavored. We also ordered the creamed spinach side dish, which we found to be too sweet. The mac and cheese side was to die for, and the dessert was lovely. Next time I think we'll order the prime rib. Hopefully we have a better experience next time!"

            "review": "Probably the place I enjoyed eating at most in Vegas, though also likely some of the worst service I had.\n\nLet's hit the bullet points. Steakhouse in NY-NY. Pricey, but not excessively so (especially for Vegas).  Great food, meh atmosphere, and while I personally had poor service, my impression was that in general, the service is very good.\n\nMy dinner partner and I both had filet mignon - very, very good.  We also split a side of mac and cheese.  Not only was it enough to share (though probably not so much that you'd be a pig if you ate the whole thing yourself), but it was absolutely amazing.  Served in a metal pot, with some kind of crust baked on top... I enjoyed it as much as the steak, and I love steak, and it was a good steak.  The meat also came with one giant potato chip, which I thought was unique, if weird.  Also, not the best potato chip I've ever had, but then, I'm partial to pringles.\n\nMy one real gripe was that we asked our waiter for information on the size of the steak - and we were told 20 ounces, with a large bone.  This seemed odd to us, and, indeed, when our neighbor's  waiter came by, he gave a spiel going through the whole menu, the specials, the sizes of the steaks,etc, and it was an 8 ounce cut of meat, which seemed to make a bit more sense.  I wouldn't have minded the nice menu rundown.  I totally had waiter envy.\n\nAlso, while fantastic, the meal was over a hundred dollars.  Not terrible, I guess, but we didn't have drinks, desserts, appetizers... even separate sides.  And the atmosphere isn't what I would expect for that.  It's dark, but not especially romantic, and at least where we were sitting it was hard to forget we were in the middle of a casino.  I'd prefer to have had a little more of an escape.\n\nSo, possibility for a great steak, and based on the mac & cheese, the other dishes are likely quite good as well, but not the place to go if you want to be frugal or want to have a special dining experience.\n\nBut sometimes, it's just all about that great steak, isn't it?"

I ordered the filet mignon, medium, and my wife ordered the prime rib, also medium. Both were cooked perfectly, and the quality of the meat was extremely high.\n\nFor sides we had the yukon gold puree, very tasty, and green beans, also very tasty. They have a great drink selection, some nice house cocktails (I had the Fire and Ice I believe it was called, a fun mix of cucumber and jalapenos), and the service was great.\n\nThe only downside was the location/atmosphere. The entrance is directly from the casino floor, which I tend to like the restaurants set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the restaurant our table was seated far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.\n\nOverall, a great place to eat for a nice meal with amazing steaks.

The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated.

While searching for other options, we also realized we didn't have the appropriate apparel packed for us to go to any other steakhouses... so we went on a hunt for a fairly casual place. My cousin found this place online and for whatever reason, we were convinced this place was a casual restaurant. I was thinking... outback-steakhouse casual. So without much thought or consideration we strolled in with shorts and my brother went in with a sleeveless shirt and felt so awkward being seated. This may not be your super upscale restaurant where they won't seat you unless in proper attire, but \"casual\" is not the average \"casual\" attire you would think. I guess I forgot, we were in vegas and the average person is dolled up regardless of occasion! Regardless, we were seated and service was amazing. The waiters knew the menu inside and out and without hesitance knew what to recommend for those who were first timers.\n\nThe food itself was amazing as well. I'm not a professional when it comes to steakhouses by all means but from what I have tried, the dry aged steak was pretty amazing. I also had the spinach salad as well as the sauteed french green beans and both were impressive. Portions were HUGE and all of us were SO FULL trying to each finish the dry aged steak. I would say men would be able to finish the steak but women should think to share no matter how hungry they may be--and most especially if you are thinking to order sides.\n\nAll in all, I would give the steakhouse a 4 because I can't necessarily say that this was the BEST steak I have ever had and the BEST restaurant experience. The ambiance, the food, the service were all great... but nothing exceptional out of all the places I've been to in Las Vegas. I would however think to come back and also recommend to friends!"

My boyfriend got steak, and I ordered the roasted chicken and I also ordered a side of green beans (at steakhouses like this, it is common for your main dish to not come with any sides at all). When the food came, my plate had roasted chicken, rice, and green beans on it, and another large side of green beans was brought along with it. I was a bit peeved with this as the menu description of my entree had not indicated that it would come with rice or green beans...or with anything, really. I thought that it was wrong of our waitress to not let me know that my plate already came with green beans on it, and that she had let me order an expensive side of green beans anyways. When I confronted our waitress, she was kind and apologetic and said that she would remove the green beans from our ticket. She then picked up the side of green beans and before taking them away, she said that if she had known that my chicken was supposed to come with green beans that she would have let me know. I don't know how you can work in such a high-ticket restaurant and not know if your main dishes come with sides or not....if you work in such an expensive restaurant, you should really know the menu. At least the green beans were tasty, the chicken ended up being dry, the rice overcooked, and Paul's steak's marinade was overpowering and not very good. Overall I was disappointed in the food, the service, the ambiance, and the price.....oh well."

First things first, the service here was top notch from everyone from the hostess the busers, the waiter and the manager.  They were attentive without  being annoying, fast, and pleasant to deal with.\n\nIn regards to the food, the wife and I shared an appetizer of shrimp and cheesy grits which were both cooked and season perfectly.  For the main dish I had their signature dry aged steak and my wife had the fillet.  Both steaks were cooked to our request and tasted great.  The wife's fillet was so tender that it almost melted in your mouth.\n\nHere is the con.  The resturant advertised itself as high end charging premium prices.  Their website stated that the dress was business casual.  When I pay 195 bucks for two people to eat I expect great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  And the last thing is the reason I can't give it five stars.  I have nothing against tee shirts and cargo shorts, in fact that's how I dress normally...just not when I go to a place with a dress code.  They allowed guest to come in wearing torn t-shirts and baseball caps and people that were so drunk they couldn't stand without assistance.  I'm all good with that...if I'm eating at an outback steak house."

My wife got the queen size prime rib cut and i ordered the rib eye.  Both were satisfactory.  Starting off with my wife's prime rib.  It was soft, tender, lots of juice, buttery, i mean its so perfect.  As far as for Rib Eye, its not as good as the first time.  But it always has the char grilled favor, which really grabs the attention.  My cut wasn't too bad, but it has some party requires extra work to chew.  I have to recommend their crab cakes to anyone who goes there.  Their crab cakes are make from real ALASKAN KING CRAB meat.  I think it really worth the money.  Anyways i would recommend anyone to give it shot."

One is a tavern with a restaurant  I'm not a professional food connoisseur, but I've been to at least 50 different steakhouse's nation wide. There were six people in our party. The service was just adequate. The appetizers (shrimp cocktails and crab cakes) were good. Four of us ordered their signature steak (Dry Aged bone in New York Strip) I like it medium rare. When I tried to cut into it I shook the whole table, it was that tough. Also the same with one of my guests. No problem 10 minutes goes by and the waiter returned with two new ones. Again... both were tough as nails. this time the manager came over and I showed him how bad it was. So I said lets just change both to a filet mignon. Manager asks what temperature would you like that? both medium rare please. another 10 minutes goes by and he returns with two new ones. My guests was done right however, I cut into mine and it was so rare it looked blue in the middle. I picked up my plate walked over to the manager and asked him what he thought it was cooked to? Hm... thats on the rare side he said. I said No... thats RAW! and go ahead and keep the steak Im done. I walked back to my table and guests. The worst part, the manager never came back to apologize or show any kind of empathy for that whole experience! Its not the fact I spent $650.00 for dinner where their supposed to specialize in steaks, and they had THREE times to get it right.  Its all about customer service when things go wrong. I will NEVER entertain my guests there again. By the way I was there 9/17/16 @ 6:00 in the room on the left side with the long table. I'm not sure of the server's name nor the Managers."

He said he'd send our waiter. Instead two more old fashions showed up. Sent those back and ordered beers from the waiter.\n\nFood finally shows up, steak was ok, cooked properly, right on the inside, but seemed pretty charred on the outside and overall was cold, like it had been sitting around a while. With the creamed spinach, the spinach was hardly done and overall was not very creamy. The mushrooms were a great mix of mushrooms with a nice smokey flavor, but also cold like they'd been sitting around even longer than the steak. \n\nNo idea where the other reviewers have been eating but if you've had a good steak in Seattle, San Francisco or Chicago, stay clear of Gallaghers."

Simply put, probably the best steak I've ever eaten.\n\nThe menu claimed that the aged Strip was their trademark, but I went ahead and ordered a filet mignon. A few moments after I regretted my decision, but after taking a bite, I was really glad that I ordered what I did. The filet mignon has an incredible crust on the outside, and my steak was cooked just about as I ordered it (medium rare) on the inside. I say \"just about\" because parts of mine were a bit rare, but not raw, so I wasn't at all picky about it. I also opted to get their chowder as an appetizer, had a side of green beans with my steak, and tried the calamari -- which was my first time ever having it. Oh yeah, I also had some mac and cheese.\n\nAll really excellent. If you haven't eaten calamari, I'll just tell you that (at least in this case) it's a very mild almost nonexistent flavored flavor with a slightly chewy but tender texture to it. The appearance of tentacles may gross you out if you order it, but trust me, it's good eats. The mac and cheese was also great and had a nice little bitterness to it to keep the already rich cheese from being over the top. I often tend to much prefer baked mac and cheese, but Gallagher's is some of the best non-baked mac and cheese I've had. The chowder was delicious as well, and was probably my favorite I've ever had until I wound up having some in Seattle, but that's for another review. I really liked the fact that it was a bit on the thinner side, because super thick chowders just aren't my thing. I didn't get much of a bacon flavor, but I did get a bacon smokiness which was fantastic.\n\nGallagher's is expensive. If you couldn't guess that by it being a steakhouse in Vegas, you'd hopefully guess it based on the look of the place. I will tell you that everything about Gallagher's is phenomenal. It was a bit too warm for comfort sitting next to the kitchen, but everything about it was awesome. I'd like to try another \"fancy\" restaurant the next time in Vegas, but it'd be hard for me to go somewhere other than Gallagher's when I know it's so damn delicious."

We started off with the clams, which were AMAZING to the point that I wanted to drink the broth. I even requested the server to leave the broth after all the clams were eaten so I could soak it up with bread. Too much? Maybe. \n\nIn terms of main courses, the steak portions are huge. I shared a NY Strip Steak (which was phenomenal) with a side of mashed potatoes, and left full and happy. If you're picky about how your steak is cooked, I would suggest going a step up from what you usually order. i.e. I like my steak on the rare side, so we ordered a medium, which was really a medium rare. \n\nAnother trick to note: my friend wanted bacon and cheese for his baked potato, and our server ended up bringin out two large bowls of bacon and cheese for the table to share. Such an added, delightful bonus to the meal. Because in my humble opinion, bacon makes the world go round. \n\nIn terms of ambience (New York/Hollywood legends), the price (moderate), the service (great), and quality of food (outstanding), you can't go wrong with Gallagher's for your Las Vegas dining experience."

Good thing we had called ahead because it was pretty crowded for 6:30 on a Saturday night in Vegas. \n\nService:\nService was awesome. Our waiter was a little quirky but nice. He recommended some favorites of his and asked us where we were from and made conversation even though he was busy. He was very attentive. Our water glasses were never empty as there was a guy circling the restaurant constantly refilling drinks. When I had a little trouble finding the restroom, an older waiter politely pointed it out and called me \"doll\". Can't beat that!\n\nFood:\nFood was YUMMY! Crusty yet soft bread basket with lots of butter to start with. Husband got the New York steak aged 40 days and he said it was one of the best steaks he ever got. The guy sitting next to us said the same thing about his. I'm not a steak eater and I had the salmon and it was delish! Came with a side of quinoa cooked really well. We got the Yukon smashed postatos and asparagus as sides. It's a bit of a bummer you have to order them separate but they were really good and definitely big enough to share. The sauce that came on the asparagus was great. We got the lava cake for dessert and I'm not a huge fan of lava cake so I gave that to my husband and ate the yummy ben and jerry's ice cream that came on it. Next time we'll have to get appetizers, the couple next to us got this shrimp thing that looked really good. \n\nIt's loud in there but everywhere in Vegas is loud. If you want a quiet, romantic dinner you should go to Napa or Santa Barbara or Sedona or something. The people next to us were getting annoyed at the funny drunk at the table across the room who was telling loud stories. HELLO! It's VEGAS! And he wasn't rude, just loud. Lighten up, peeps. \n\nYes it was also kind of overpriced but it's hard to get that kind of quality and service in Vegas so I would say it was worth it for a splurge. I will definitely be going back!"

Seriously the BEST filet Mignon I've ever had and I'm a midwest girl so I guess that says a lot...cooked to perfection!  I ordered the Filet with Bearnaise and we split one of their side specials...blue cheese bacon mashed potatoes (also YUM!).  My husband got the New York Strip, which I believe they age in house and he said it was easily the top 4 steaks he's had (he's way more of a steak guy than I am) and it was enormous!  I think we could have had about 3 baskets of the grain fruit bread they offered with the meal as well.  Our server was spot on and very helpful.  The only downside, which you could tell management was trying to remedy, was a group of middle-aged drunk guys who were being really loud and obnoxious (won't deduct any stars for those idiots' disruption).  After the meal, we were offered a dessert menu and my husband asked the server if they had any birthday desserts since we were celebrating.  The server brought out a little scoop of cookies n' cream ice cream with a homemade birthday chocolate and candle...nice touch :) Definitely made for a special evening and we will surely come back when we visit Vegas again."

The environment is okay, the service was average bordering on below average, my $43 Sirloin was good but not STELLAR; whereas, my Filet from The Palm Steakhouse 2 nights before for the same price was exceptional. My mother's Prime Rib AND my father's Filet both had to be sent back back because they were undercooked. \n\nI'm giving it a 3 because my Sirloin was tasty (just not for the price tag) and my girlfriend's Pork was good as well."

I'll take a cucumber martini and can you bring a wine list. We Order a bottle of wine. \n\n15 minutes later. He just opens it. No talk about it no introduction. Ok. Great wine. Then asks if were ready. \n\nI ask about the 1 aged steak this restaurant has. [thank god I know what the aging process is because he didn't explain a thing abut it ]. I asked him if there was any feature. He said nothing except the catch of the day is mahi mahi... Which is weird because it says halibut on the board when you walk in. I asked him what was the seasoning on the fries, he asked me if I had an allergy... Then clearest bullshitted the ingredients. I responded with.... No I just wanted to the seasoning that's in the Steak Cut Seasoned Fries. I basically asked every single questioned that he could have answered had he said one sentence at the table. \n\nDinner: \nWedge.... Boring. Bland. Watered down blu cheese \n\nClam chowder.... Yummy one star\n\nAged strip ..... For the process that steak goes through I was expecting a ton of flavor. Disappointed. \n\nVeal.... AMAZING ... Another star \n\nMushroom medley...    Bland \n\nPur\u00e9e...... Bland \n\nI order a dirty martini for dessert.. I see it just sitting at the bar... So I got up to go get it. Then ordered another drink from the bartender since my server was no where to be found. \n\nThen another guy closes us out... My sever had been missing since steak time. \n\nOverall fail from this place."

I don't think you have to necessarily book months in advance but definitely call ahead if you're planning to eat that day. \n\nCame here for New Years and while the prices were generally $20+ more than usual, everything was simply delicious. We ordered the rib eye, prime rib, lamb chops, signature aged steak, Alaskan halibut, the seafood celebration and a salad. ($650+)\n\nEvery dish was super tasty, but I personally preferred the rib eye. it was literally melt in your mouth delicious I went to heaven status. The rub on that meat was amazing and it was just done very well. Then I would rank the rest in this order: chops, aged signature and the prime rib. The prime rib is a huge chunk of meat, and I ranked it last (although it's pretty neck in neck) because it didn't taste anything too remarkable, not to say that it wasn't tasty. It's also probably the cheapest because they cook a huge chunk of meat and then slice into portions as opposed to say the rib eye, where they have to cook each cut individually. The rib eye was just spectacular and memorable. Take my advice and order this if you're stuck wanting to order everything, you'll thank me later. \nAnother note, don't order the signature aged steak in medium, we made the mistake of doing so and it turned out just a bit toooo dry for our liking. \n\nOur waiter was also superb, putting up with my family's desire to take a hundred family photos before we can even begin eating. What a great restaurant, every pennies worth."

Sort of a late anniversary dinner for Josie and I. We had 515pm reservations and arrived early and were seated within minutes of arrival. The host was quite friendly and evoked a great starting conversation setting the mood for our dinner. Bryan was our waiter and had a great knowledge of the menu and specials. I know you are wondering (did drink service come quick?) it did. We had waters in just a few moments and our drink order was taken. We also ordered our appetizer of seared Ahi Tuna.Seasoned quite well with a creole type seasoning and braised just perfectly. It came with some melon slices and other seasonal fruits. We also then ordered a salad round. I had the house wedge with blue cheese Josie had the beet salad. The wedge reminded me of my first ever wedge at a place in Henderson Nevada, Nick's Supper Club. (NOSTALGIA). Perfect amount of the Blue Cheese dressing with small tomatoes and a couple croutons. Josie said the beet salad was perfectly dressed and had great flavor.our main course, their aged bone in New York Steak, was a perfect medium rare with no outside seasoning just the grilled natural flavor that awoke the carnivore inside me. We shared the steak so we could enjoy a full meal without left overs and feeling over stuffed. Our sides were Mac-n-Cheese and creamed spinach. Neither were overwhelming in taste. They did have good seasoning and flavor. We did not have time or room for desert but want to go back because the menu looked really inviting.\nThank you for eating at Gallagher's Steakhouse. We will likely go back and try a few items we saw that looked really good. The staff was hard working and friendly. Our waiter stated that it was a busier night than normal for a Friday, and the staff was handling it quite professionally. If you get the chance to go to NYNY please check this great place out. You will not be disappointed."

However the steaks needed some seasoning, more garlic, sea salt, cracked pepper or spices of some kind, it was kind of bland but tender.

Located inside New York New York this steakhouse is pretty small but well arranged. We had dinner to celebrate our anniversary. \n\nAs with many fine steakhouses everything is a la carte, we both decided on the Cowboy Ribeye and I chose (my favorite) sauteed mushrooms, my wife picked mac n cheese as our sides. The mac n cheese was different comes with pieces of bacon so it gave it a  smokey, crunchy touch. I must say the steak was great!! Cooked to perfection, excellent pink center steak comes with a pile of thin onion rings. Now I'm not know for being a light eater but I must say that this cut was a big portion that for the first time in my steakhouse dining experience I didn't finish my steak and doggie bagged it.  My wife was shocked!! She asked if was ok. Lol I said yes I'm just very full. So we skipped dessert and headed back to our room where I had a bottle of my wifes favorite bubbly waiting for us.\n\nSo if your ever in Vegas and can't decide on which steakhouse to try walk on over to New York New York and give Galleghers a try."

Then we ordered our steaks (Filet Mignon and the their signature, aged sirloin) cooked medium... big mistake.. huge (mistake #3).  I asked the server how they cook their meat.. medium = pink all the way through?  The server said confidently yes.  We trusted him.  I had wrongly assumed that steakhouses tend to undercook their meat (order medium = get medium rare..).\n\nOur steak was dry.  Both of ours.  The filet was medium well.  Some parts were cooked all the way through.  We should've complained.  But we didn't.  I almost choked on some parts of the meat.  My wife kept telling me that I cook a better steak at home.\n\nThe appetizer (oysters) were ok, but they were nothing special at $3 per piece.  The soup (chowder) and the caesar salad was pretty good.  Up until the steaks came out we were very happy.  Then the steaks just disappointed us.  Man.. I really really love steaks and I had high hopes.  \n\nWe were there with 2 little kids.  They gave us a booth and we did ok.  I always feel bad about taking little kids to nice restaurants.  It could be annoying to others there.  It would've been worth all the trouble taking little ones to a good restaurant if the meat was good.  \n\nNow, forever I'll wonder what if I ordered the steaks medium rare.. or even rare... forever.\n\nService was good, but not excellent.\n\nAtmosphere was ok.  it's an upscale, busy restaurant.  If you're gonna go here, make sure to get a reservation and order steaks rare.\n\nI would've given them 2 stars but because it was us who ordered medium.. 3 stars for what it could've been."

Although the waitress said that they don't put on a heavy char, my steak came out looking black.  The funny thing was, it didn't taste bitter like a charred steak does.  A little strange because of that, but the inside meat was good.  I didn't bother to send it back because I was with a date and didn't want her to have to wait for another one to come out.  And the steak was huge.  Easily 16oz.  And at under $40 (I believe it was actually $34), it's a relative bargain in Vegas.\n\nThe wine list is standard for Vegas - over priced and not inspiring.  But the wines by the glass were reasonable and of decent quality.  The Caesar salad was decent except for too much dressing.  Thick, good asparagus were used for the side.  \n\nService was friendly and professional.  Just don't ask for their opinion of getting your steak \"charred.\"  \n\nBut do get drinks from the bar there.  The shots are filled to the rim and the bartenders are great.  Three stars."

I knew if I didn't get here a good steak she would throw a fit all night, so I opened my wallet and fed the beast. First off, I would suggest making a reservation here if you don't want to wait awhile, this place gets busy and stays busy. We arrived at our reserved time and were seated right away in a little corner of the restaurant. It was a nice cozy little table, a little too little, but was situated where there was less noise. The restaurant was extremely loud due to the proximity of the tables, so just don't expect the most romantic dinner out here.\n\nThe service was spectacular, 5 seconds after we were seated, our drink orders were taken and the menu was explained to us. All portions of the meal were perfectly timed and the servers worked with me to get us to our 930pm show on time.\n\nAs for food. We got the seared diver scallops as an appetizer, caesar salad as the second dish, and the dry aged new york strip and cowboy ribeye steaks with the bernaise sauce. Sides are ala carte and served separately, but I ordered the creamed spinach and grilled asparagus. Everything tasted great, but the steak portions are no joke, the pictures on this page do them no justice. I barely finished half of my steak and had to take the rest home. If I could go back I would have eliminated one of the sides from my order and possibly even the caesar salad and I would have still been full. Gallagher's steaks seemed a little tougher than what I was used to, perhaps it was because they were dry aged, or maybe because they were just that thick of a cut. My bill with all of the above and 1 glass of wine came out to $169.\n\nIf you are in the area give Gallagher's a whirl, and come hungry.\n\nP.S. the leftovers were delicious."

            "review": "Gallagher Steakhouse is located within the bowels of New York, New York casino. This restaurant features dry aged beef and their legendary Gallagher hospitality. Their signature 2 inch, bone-in top sirloin steak that has been dry aged for 30 days is one of the restaurant's top sellers. It should be noted that Gallaghers was once privately owned in New York until it became a franchise. Reservations are encouraged, especially if you plan to dine at around 7pm to 8pm. A dinner evening spent in this restaurant can cost you a minimum of $200 for two people. \n\nOverview: I have visited at this restaurant a couple of times in the past several months and I was not overly impressed by the experience. The service was good, but the restaurant relied too heavily on its name to generate business. However, in fairness, it is still an above average steakhouse. Just a side note. If you do not know how to distinguish or cannot taste the difference between a 30 day dry aged beef and a regular cut of beef, then save your money and go to some other steakhouse like Outback. It will be cheaper for you and you'll won't be disappointed. \n\nPROS: The restaurant offers dry aged beef, quality service, and can be easily found in the casino. The food is plentiful and an entree can be easily shared between two people. \n\nCONS: The restaurant is really close to the casino floor so the dining atmosphere is somewhat disrupted with the gambling action outside. Additionally, this steakhouse does not have a restroom of its own. You will need to exit the restaurant and use the casino restroom nearby. \n\nRestaurant Class: Upper-Middle \n\nFood: (3.5 out of 5 stars) The steaks are well prepared and cooked to order. Additionally, a couple of their steak entrees are large enough to be shared by two people. More importantly, the dry aged steaks do not disappoint, especially if you are a steak connoisseur. The sides and soups are somewhat a different matter. The sides are nondescript and the soups tend to run on the salty side. \n\nAtmosphere: (3 out of 5 stars) The ambiance and the genre falls in line with the Gallagher's theme in New York. It is lively and professional. However, that atmosphere tends to be ruined by the gaming action just outside the restaurant. And unless you are seated in a secluded and private room of the restaurant, you will not feel like you are in a premium New York steakhouse. \n\nCleanliness: (3.5 out of 5 stars) The staff does a good job in keeping the tables and the dining area clean. However, because Vegas allows patrons to smoke in casinos, there is a very faint smell of cigarette smoke in the linens. \n\nService: (4 out of 5 stars) The staff is professional and attentive. However, if you dining with a large party (6 people or more), the service level may diminish a bit; especially if you happen to be dining during a peak hour. Overall, there service level is consistent with the Gallagher's name. \n\nRestroom Facilities: (3 out of 5 stars) The restaurant does not have a restroom of its own. If you do need to use the facilities, you will need to exit the restaurant and use the casino's restrooms. Other than that, the casino usually does a good job of keeping the facilities clean and well stocked."

I told him it was a Little  to rare for my choice and he immediately took it back to the kitchen. When I got it back it was like they gave me  new steak.

It was tough. The macaroni and cheese was undercooked. The noodles in particular were hard. The asparagus had a slightly bitter taste. We added in two sodas and the bill was $170.

While sipping on our manhattans, we placed our meal orders, both ordering the same thing - clam chowder, their signature NY strip, and the garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe clam chowder was spectacular. Thick, creamy, chunky. The mashed potatoes were good, but a bit too whipped for my liking. The steak - the signature wet and dry aged steak - was, well, tough and not all that flavorful. The waitress did recommend the ribeye (saying it was her favorite), and hindsight being what it is I'm thinking we should have listened to her.\n\nThere are many better places in Vegas than this one, including one of my favorites (Mon Ami Gabi).

More so, it was probably a good warning because the co-worker I was with doesn't pull any punches and looks for the opportunities to take the shots.\n\nThe bar was well stocked, Fernando was skilled and they had Newcastle Brown (and a few others) on tap.\n\nThe next night, our dinner reservations got mysteriously canceled and again, protracted negotiations got our party of 15 drinks at the bar and the table in the back room.\n\nThe back room was especially cool, with photos and painting of pinup girls and starlets on the walls and a bar dedicated to that room (read super-fast).  It was a steak house menu - sure there were a few chicken and fish dishes for the people who will live longer, but the steak was to die for.\n\nThe waiter suggested sharing sides and we ended up delegating the selection to him!  The macaroni and cheese is great and the hot and cold appetizer sampler was excelllent - lobster, shrimp, crab cakes and more.  Mmm.\n\nI had a filet, cooked perfectly medium-rare, topped with crab and bernaise sauce.  It was delicious.  I think that three other people had the same and others were jealous.\n\nWe had tickets to a show and only had an hour and a half to devote to dinner and we got out of there on time, surprisingly.\n\nFor me, the reason to come to Las Vegas is the good food, people watching and the good food.  Gallagher's is the place for it."

Overall, great service, great food, great drinks! \n\nWe'd been to Ruth's Chris for steak everytime we're in Vegas, and this time he wanted to try something different. Thanks to all those Yelpers out there for helping us decide! I called on a Friday morning to make dinner reservations for that same day, no problem! I do recommend reservations, as there were people being quoted some serious wait times as we walked in. The atmosphere in this place is great. Dimly lit, dark woods and you can even peer into the kitchen from the dining room. Our server was awesome, very attentive without being smothering. We enjoyed some mixed drinks from the bar.. very good! For dinner we both had a wedge salad, shared the mac 'n cheese, I ordered the fillet, he got the strip steak. First of all, I cannot even begin to describe how wonderfully tasty the mac 'n cheese was!!! Gooey goodness of cheese with pieces of bacon mixed in. My mouth is seriously watering just thinking of it. It's a MUST have, so make sure to order it. We both liked our steaks, even though we agree that Ruth's Chris steaks are better. \n\nIf I was ranking this place just based on steaks, they'd get 4 stars, but their outstanding service, superb mac 'n cheese, relatively reasonable prices and overall great ambiance boosts this place up to the almighty 5 stars!"

Well it was amazing to say the least!  This booth is totally secluded from the rest of the restaurant and we got to watch the chefs prep the meals. Pretty amazing if you're a foodie.  The waiter was nothing but excellent and everyone was very helpful. The staff is knowledgeable about what they serve and where it is from. The chef even visited our table on multiple occasion to offer free food to taste. I assumed it would be either added to our tab (no big deal) or the portions would be taster size. But no, the portions were regular size and should I say delicious. I rarely feel like the service is outstanding, but this was epic. That's what I want when I go into a restaurant, the feeling that you are just as important as the millionaire or the rich asshole at the next table. If I could give this place a 10 I would. Thank you for the amazingly delicious food and drinks and for the experience of a life time!"

Excellent service!\n\nAs for the food, I'm not a huge meat eater so I decided to forego the whole reason behind this restaurant and opt for 1lb. of King Crab legs and then munch on a few bites of steak from other plates in our party.  My legs were quite substantial, however they got cold fast since they come split in 1/2.  Not a bit deal, but when you're paying $45 for a plate of food you'd like it to be warm.  I also had the chance to taste the New York Strip and Ribeye, both cooked to perfection, nice and tender.  Our table decided to order several sides to share including the asparagus, mac and cheese and something else that escapes my memory (too many bottles of wine).  All the sides were absolutely amazing and the asparagus was cooked perfectly.\n\nGreat experience eating at Gallaghers and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.\n\nKnow before you go:  the bathrooms are a mile away so don't drink too much!!"

We even tried the original Gallagher's in New York and I must say, the meat in Vegas is much tastier! We came here on a Saturday night around 8 pm for my sister's 31st birthday. The food was great (there were some bad dishes, but the server took care of it for us), service was awesome, ambiance was perfect for the celebration and the wine we ordered was on point. \n\nFOOD: When you come to Gallagher's you HAVE TO GET THE STEAK! The meat is dry-aged for 21 days. You can see the meat refrigerator in front of the restaurant with dates on how long the meat has been dry-aged for. We ordered the following dishes: \n\n1. Clams, Casino: I was happy the clams weren't over cooked and they did a great job baking the clams perfectly so the inside was still juicy, but the top layer had a nice crunch to it. \n\n2. Lamb Lollipops: The lamb was medium rare! It was seasoned well, cooked just the way we like it and it had a tasty green sauce on top that made the dish great! \n\n3. Roasted Beet Salad: If you love beets and is craving a refreshing salad to enjoy, then I highly recommend this dish. The salad was a great serving size for two people to share and gave us a break from all the heavy foods like onion rings, meat, etc. \n\n4. Center Cut Filet Mignon Medium Rare: I know the place is known for its dry-aged NY strip, but I preferred the filet mignon over the NY. It was so tender, well-seasoned, thick and succulent. I asked for extra candied garlic cloves as well on the side to enjoy with my filet mignon and garlic mashed potatoes. It's a smaller cut, so it was just the right amount for me. It couldn't have been more than 11 ounces. So if you want a bigger piece of meat, I would suggest the rib-eye. \n\n5. Dry-Aged New York Strip Bone-In: This dish we originally had some issues with. The cut we received was really grizzly and chewy. My sister's fiancee chewed on the first piece for almost two minutes before finally spitting it out into his napkin. The waiter immediately noticed and gave us a new piece of steak that was dry-aged to perfection, seasoned well with a fine texture and buttery flavor. The fat marbling was excellent! You can also order a side of garlic cloves and the dish went well with the mashed potatoes as well. \n\n6. Cowboy Rib-Eye: This is the fattiest meat and it came with the bone-in. The rib-eye we received was rich, tender and juicy. It had generous marbling throughout, but primarily on the outside. It was seasoned well, but I am not too fond of too much fat in my meats, so this was my least favorite. I've had better rib-eye elsewhere. \n\n7. Sides: Mashed Potatoes and Onion Rings. (All dishes are ordered/charged separately). Mashed potatoes was amazing! I wouldn't order the onion rings again. \n\n8. New England Clam Chowder: I am not sure if I've had better New England Clam Chowder anywhere else in Vegas aside from the Palace Station Oyster Bar. What I love about this dish is it's not too thick, but it isn't watery either. The ratio of clams, potatoes, bacon and veggies was great! It was enough to share between my husband and I. \n\nSERVICE: AMAZING SERVICE! I always love coming here. The server was so attentive to us. We were seated in a more private area in the other dining room since it was my sister's birthday and the server still kept an eye on us. He switched our NY Strip when he noticed it was inedible. He served all the food within a timely manner and we were never left waiting long. The busser and hostess was also a pleasure to be around.\n\nPRICE: For two appetizers, a salad and soup, three entrees and two sides, the entire bill including tip was around $290, which is not bad. There was 5 of us so it came out to roughly around $58 a person. This is reasonable for the size of all the dishes, service and quality. \n\nOverall, I love Gallagher's!!! I am excited to come back again for the next family celebration. \n\nHappy Dining, \n\nJ Tran"

Really reminded me of being in a classic New York eatery. \n\nFor starters, we started with Lobster Bisque, which was very flavorful. This set the tone for the rest of the meal. For sides, we ordered the creamed spinach, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes... and they were all admirably, if not spectacularly, done. The dry aged cuts were simply breathtaking. I've enjoyed many over the course of my life, but these were cooked to perfection. Can't say enough about these steaks! The meal was definitely the highlight, but the service was impeccable! Kudos to the wait staff for making it an excellent dining experience!\n\nGallagher's is actually quite affordable for a steakhouse (all of your classic cuts of steak will range somewhere between $40-$80, the appetizers hover around $15, and the sides just barely stay in single digits), but I'd recommend it without hesitation if you appreciate a fantastic steak!"

We were seated immediately and once we were inside it was hard to imagine that we were in a loud casino. \n\nService was wonderful, old school steakhouse feel. Sam, our server, was attentive, helpful and a fun addition to the meal.\n\nThe food was great. As an appetizer we started with the shrimp and grits...yummy!We both ordered the filet mignon, the onion rings, and the mushroom medley. Everything was al a carte but just the right amount of food. We both left satisfied, not overly stuffed. \n\nThe in house photographer was a strange but fun added bonus. She actually took really nice pictures of us. The only part I didn't like was the fact that she brought them back to us as actual prints. It would make more sense to have them on an iPad or tablet and then print the ones people want. It seemed wasteful and weird to think about where the prints go if we don't buy them. We bought one and the lady who took the pictures was really nice and not pushy about trying to get us to buy them."

I don't think it gets any better than that.  \n\nThe crab cakes were awesome and so full of light chunky pieces of crab meat.  Not overly seasoned so I got to appreciate the flavor of the crab.  \n\nFor an entree I had the cowboy rib eye.  You get what you pay for and the prices here are justified by the portion size.  When the server put the plate down in front of me I was happy I didn't order anything else.  The steak was great and done just right.  That potato puree was to die for too."

We came to Vegas for a typical quarterly california tryst and found our way to gallaghers.\n\nThis place is the neighborhood steakhouse that you just refuse to let go. The only difference is that this place is in cool casino. \n\nI'm gonna keep this short, but make sure you get the dry-aged new York steak and get it medium (medium-well was a lil over). \n\nLastly, request server paul. He isn't gonna come over and butter your bread, but he is the hometown server that we all love. He's a guy's guy and you'll see when you meet him.\n\nEnjoy!\nAaron G."

Asparagus makes another fine side.\n\nDesserts are \"ok\" and coffee refills are somewhat slow, but steaks are awesome.  Also had the Australian Lobster tail in '08 and it was great."

Four very large shrimp only wish it came with horseradish in addition to the cocktail sauce. The filet I ordered was good and very large, I like my steak rare, this was done a bit on the medium side but not terrible. I was told the sides would be enough to share. Well, I ordered asparagus ($13) got 5 spears not what I would call a \"sharing\" quantity. For dessert the waiter suggested the toffee pudding - I would not recommend it. Service - okay but nothing special. Overall, not worth the $$$"

            "review": "I had a lovely dinner here with the hubby, make sure you guys make a reservation because we didn't and we ended up waiting about 35 minutes for a table. \n\nOnce seated in had alerted the server that we are in a slight time crunch because we were going to go see kaskade after dinner. And he was understanding and got right to our order so we can leave on time. We got crab cakes for an appetizer to start and my hubby got the dry aged steak (and with bernaise sauce) with an Australian lobster tail, and I got the rack of roasted lamb and we were going to share a side of mash potatoes. \n\nThe food was cooked perfectly, my lamb was extremely tender and practically falling off the bone, and my hubby loved his meal as well the only down side for him was he asked if he could get the main lobster tail instead of the Australian lobster tail but they couldn't do that. And personally we just prefer the Maine lobster because it's sweeter and more succulent. You must get the bernaise sauce if you get the steak, it takes the steak to a completely different level, it makes it so much better. The crab cakes was great and so was the mash potatoes. \n\nOur dinner was very delicious and we'll definitely be back the next time we're in vegas."

            "review": "We weren't planning on eating at a steakhouse while in Las Vegas, but when we saw their display of dry aged slabs of steaks, our eyes were set. It was a spontaneous decision to eat there and we were not disappointed. There was no wait. We got seated by he kitchen so we had a great view of all the meats on being grilled. Well, all of us of course ordered steak. They only had one type of meat that they aged, and that is the New York strip. It would have been better if they had other selections that they dry aged. The steak was delicious. The waiter's recommendation of getting it medium cooked is perfect. The meat was juicy, tender and flavorful. We also ordered a couple sides. Their mashed potatoes with asiago chedder was their side of the day and it was super yummy. The staff was overall nice and very attentive. They even let one of our friends take a picture of the kitchen area. The price is fair for what they serve. Expect to spend over $100 for two. Maybe more if you order alcoholic drinks with your meal. To those who love steak and is in the Las Vegas New York New York Hotel & Casino, I recommend you try this place and their dry aged steak cooked medium. Bon App\u00e9tit!"

            "review": "Tasty, tasty steak!\n\nWe wanted to have steak before leaving Vegas. Looking at our options, Gallagher's seems to offer the best value for quality. Made a reservation to make sure we got in on time, as we had a show to catch. Definitely the way to go, since we saw a group turned away just before we got seated.\n\nHad:\nAged Top Sirloin - the aging sure did enhance the flavors of this steak. The beef is the highlight here. They don't try to cover it up.\nCowboy Rib Eye - Big, tender and juicy slab of beef. \nBoth were perfectly cooked to order. We didn't eat any steak for a few weeks following this meal because we didn't want to follow up such good steak with something worse.\n\nWe also ordered the steak fries. These were great as well. Crunchy on the outside, hot, soft potato on the inside. The ketchup, omg the ketchup! Delicious ketchup with a kick. Our guess is that it's infused with truffle oil and possibly some roasted jalapeno as well. Whatever it is, it lifted the fries beyond 'just another basket of fries'.\n\nOur waiter was attentive throughout. \n\nWe found out that there was an emergency in the kitchen (saw paramedics coming in), yet the only tell-tale sign was that our food took a little longer to come out. They  run a smooth operation.\n\nWe have no regrets picking Gallagher's over the other, more upscale steakhouses. The steak is definitely worth the price here, especially when you take into account the Strip premium."

It's the best piece of meat on the menu as it's the only cut that is dry aged.  \n\nMade a late reservation after seeing Barry Manilow at the Paris.. which by the way was a much better show than I expected.  Upon arriving my co-worker and I were promptly seated at a small table somewhere in the back of the restaurant.  We both ordered the house cut NY steak with asparagus and steak fries.  \n\nGot bread and drinks and then out came the steaks.  Wow.. what a great piece of meat.  I'm definitely a fan of dry aged beef and this steak did not disappoint.  My co-workers steak came out a little overcooked and she was gonna eat it but I made them send it back.  The waiter was really great about it and he came back with a new steak like 3 minutes later.. ok so he stole it from another guys order but who cares right?  This steak was done just right and my co-worker was really glad I made them do that.  \n\nThe sides of asparagus and steak fries were good, nothing to writehome about just average.  \n\nTheir dessert menus are this weird backlit tablet thingy that's kinda hard on the eyes but nevertheless was kinda cool.  Honestly my steak was so good, I can't even remember what we got for dessert.  \n\nOverall the place could use a good scrubbing and maybe a face lift, but honestly I couldn't care less as long as they keep their prices decent and keep serving up delicious reasonable priced beef.\n\n4 Stars!!  (I'd give it 4.5 if I could)"

The meal was great.  Had the Ribeye and the group shared sides.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  The service was on-par with a top notch steakhouse.  The decor needs a little improvement but you do get that steakhouse feel.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and would visit again."
