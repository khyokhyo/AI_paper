Mmmm, delish!\n\nSPECIAL PREPARATION!\n\nBFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of \"cheesification\".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further."

While I was waiting on her, I hit the \"nearby\" button on the mobile app and BFG was right on top of the list.\n\nWe were in a rush so I read her the last couple of top tips on the place... She ordered the baked strips and I ordered 5 fried strips a la carte with ranch and wasabi cream (yelpers know everything - thanks guys for the tip)..\n\nWe took it to go, but drooled as we saw those dining in munching on their food. It was a tiny little place but the service was great (the guy that handed us our to go order - I really believed him when he said - Have a nice weekend).\n\nOur food was piping hot and super moist and crunchy. I really liked it.\n\nmy ONLY complaint was I paid 40 cents a piece for the sauce and it was a tiny little cup that was barely half full. I mean - I barely had enough for 3 strips. Fill er up please for next time!!\n\nI am definitely coming back though - and ordering the mac and cheese because every table in there (lol so like 6) had some mac and cheese on it and it looked amazing.\n\nDefinitely worth a try --- it was pretty awesome!"

Was baked mac n cheese. It was good. But how great do u expect it to b. I also had a try at their bfg dipping sauce. It was..hmm ok. A tangy thousand island is what they said it was. I will try something else next time. But this visit was average for me. Great idea but i think they have room to improve."

However, being in the neighborhood the other day I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did.\n\nFriendly service & good food at a decent price.

My favorite is the fried, which is covered in panko breading. They have numerous sauces to choose from (try the wasabi cream!). They have several sides to choose from. I recommend the Baked Mac-n-Cheese. Also, they just recently got one of those new Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, so yes to Raspberry Coke.\n\nNot only is their food delicious and worth the trip no matter what side of town you are on, the staff is always very friendly and upbeat. My boyfriend and I always feel welcomed whenever we stop in."

I have tried their grilled/baked strips and they are both amazing in different ways, the mac n Cheese is awesome and so are the grilled veggies. My favorite sauce is the house strip sauce. \n\nThe young gentleman that runs the register/manages the place has the most amazing customer service. He's part of what makes this place such a great spot to grab some grub. I'm already a regular, and will remain so. \n\nAlso I forgot to mention, the thai ice tea is amazing! I get it everytime I go.

It's now a small stringy looking funnel cake with room temperature chocolate on the side which is sad because this was the one place in town I knew had delicious funnel cakes and now it's a disappointment. Also the wait last time was a little long...I put in a to go order only for me no one was with me. Walked in to pick up and waited a minute and then someone ordered 5-10 mins after me and got their food before me which was weird. Sucks this place is delicious (except the funnel cakes now) but it's not likely I'll be back."

I usually don't like white meat because it gets dry so quickly, but the guys at BFG do it right. Tender, juicy, and moist. You can even be fancy and choose 2 different sauces! Say what? yup. Give their sides a try. The veggies are yummy, and the baked mac and cheese will make you take your clothes off. Ok, not really, but you get the point."

I saw a fellow yelper check in here so I decided to give the place a go. The location is a bit small but the staff were very friendly and asked if we had been there before and broke down the menu. I ordered the fried chicken strips and mac n cheese and he ordered the baked with fried. We each picked our 3 sauces that came with the combo. The Guy taking the order let us know which ones were homemade and which were not. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, and upon getting it the hubby and I did what we do swap pieces so we can both enjoy both baked and fried. Both the baked and fried were cooked and seasoned perfectly! The mac-n-cheese complete my LIFE let me tell you I could go there for just that alone! It was creamy and gooey at the same time and the noodles were cooked just right. The guy who brought out our food was so nice he even told us since it was our first time if there was a sauce we didn't like he would swap it out for us. We selected sweet chili, wasabi cream, ranch, honey mustard, buffalo and BFG and none of them were a disappointment, the food also came with garlic bread that was delicious as well. This place gets tops stars because from start to finish it was plesant dinning experience."

            "review": "Why has it taking me SO long too get me some BFG? Thankfully I cam say finally got me some. Sure so many reviews not sure much more could add but think every great establishment can always use another great review! It all starts with the customer service and the personnel touch both co owners show from the minute you walk into BFG. It was my first visit so looking at the menu little confusing but he did awesome job of explaining everything too me. Very clear, friendly, and understanding manner. Each step you get choice way chicken cooked, different sauces (thinking just get one; my surprise get two choices!!!), and the sides. Not just one option but few options on the sauces and sides. If get the combo comes with garlic bread. I needed too add honesty earlier because I was looking too try as much things being my first time. He told me comes with the garlic bread since going too order one on the side. Little things or sense of personnel touch gets lost in restaurants. They have stamp card too. Woot! Woot! More reason too keep coming back for more.\n\nThe chicken strips LOVE the breading anything with panko winnah. It such cleaner breading for any protein, just lighter and crisper breading outside. The meat is perfectly cooked, moist, and juicy on the inside. The sauces Wow so many too choose from need too got back try more. I had the honey mustard and the BFG. I fan of both. The sides looking at other customers going fries but it looked too good pass up. I was not disappointed. You would think fast food type of chain thinking mac and cheese. Not sure. The mac and cheese was da bomb. It was rich with the cheddar flavor, creamy, the pasta cooked al dente, and the cheese melted top it off was just perfect topping. All this for under ten dollar if that not steal of deal not sure what else there is in life. \n\nI went for lunch talk about packed. I had too wait too get place too sit down. It soooo worth the wait. They have couple tables on the outside too. I really like the artwork on the side once you walk in. It has personality of its own cartoonist style but on point too the theme of the restaurant. If never been too BFG or enjoy fried chicken strip must stop in Vegas."

We also ordered a funnel cake and that was pretty darn good too. \n\nI got the baked chicken, but I wish I'd just gone ahead and gotten the fried (damn me and my new healthy lifestyle initiative!). The baked chicken was good, but it was too salty for my taste. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to salt?\n\nAlso, for a chicken strip place, they make some pretty legit Thai iced tea.

However, what they lacked in size, they made up for in quality.  The chicken strips were very meaty, very moist for white-meat, and the panko-crust made the strips feel light and a healthier choice as opposed to flour-crusted chicken strips.  Hint: fried chicken strips go especially well with the wasabi cream sauce.\n\nStep 2: Side dish\nI've yet to try the baked mac & cheese and the grilled veggies, but the fries were pretty good.  I ordered to-go, so unfortunately, the heat and steam in the box made the fries soggy and less enjoyable, but I could still taste how potato-ey they were.  Hint: if you're going to order fries, don't order it to-go.\n\nStep 3: Sauce\nBFG offers a plethora of sauces (Remember?  I like having choices).  I ordered the BFG and Wasabi cream sauce.  The Wasabi cream is hands-down the better of the two.  It has a touch of sweetness and a touch of spiciness, but is at a level anyone can tolerate.  I highly recommend it.  The BFG sauce wasn't as special.  It tasted similar to Thousand Islands.\n\nStep 4: Drink\nNothing different from other fast food restaurants.  Although, I bet you can switch out the drink in the order for Thai Iced Coffee for a little extra.\n\nLast, but not least, BFG has especially quick service.  I got my meal in about 5 minutes.  Good food, fast service."

We both knew we would not be disappointed when we opened the door and could smell the chicken - yum! \n\nI tried the grilled chicken and my husband got the fried - we both agreed that this strips were amazingly delicious! This is seriously best grilled chicken ever that I refused to share with the hubs. He was okay with that as he wasn't going to share his fried chicken with me since he was really enjoying them. We both had the baked mac and cheese. I'm not a huge fan of Mac and cheese, but I was surprisingly impressed and enjoyed the cheesiness and creaminess of the Mac and cheese - it was gone in a matter of minutes. We picked different dips to share and try between the two of us and we loved them all! My husband's favorite dips were the buffalo and the honey mustard. I my favorite the wasabi cream (YUM!) but I also loved strip dip and the honey mustard. Needless to say, we will definitely be back!"

Over the past 5 days I've been here 3 times and both the food and the service are consistently awesome. I'm sure Jin knows how this combination of great food and great service contributes to his business.  Although Jin first told me to close my eyes and the chicken strips would taste like passionfruit, marshmallows and masago, I was pleasantly surprised how good it all was.  The fried chicken strips are crispy and juicy and cooked to order and the baked mac & cheese is really creamy and delicious.  \n\nBFG Chicken Strips may be a little hard to find as there is no street signage but it definitely worth looking for!

Had never heard of the joint before but based on the outstanding reviews I thought it deserved a visit.  My husband and I took my two nieces (ages 5 & 6) as anytime you ask what they want for dinner their response is chicken and french fries.  So they are essentially experts in this field.  \n\nUpon arrival we were greeted by Jin.  May I just say if everyone ran their restaurants with the friendliness and attentiveness as Jin the world would be a better place.  I thought to myself if the food is as great as the service this place is a godsend.  Finally, a nice easy menu - would you like baked, fried, or grilled?  Simple enough.  The meals come with (4) strips, a side, garlic bread, two dipping sauces, and a drink for the bargain basement cost under $6 dollars!  The kids menu comes with (2) strips, one side, small drink, and one dipping sauce.  \n\nWe ordered the fried chicken strips meals (2) adults and (2) kids meals with macaroni & cheese.  Niece #1 decided to go rouge and ordered the french fries with her meal but after being \"forced\" to try the mac & cheese it was all over as she began sampling the mac & cheese from all of our plates.  Niece # 2 asked \"How did they get the macaronis to taste so good?\"  This is a question I am sure the gang at BFGs gets a lot.  For first timers I would recommend each getting a different preparation of the chickens to share... we had a rookie mistake that won't happen again.  \n\nI will keep it short and sweet.  This is the real deal Holyfield.  Visit BFG's.. tell them Dana sent you.   \n\nTo Jin - how about we expand and open up a second location on our side of town ... or perhaps a food truck?  =)"

The food is cooked to order, but if you're in a hurry, you can call and order ahead. The staff is always very friendly and will change out your dip(s) if you aren't happy with your first choice.

It also has an awesome name. Come on, admit it, it does. \n\nFood: They have 3 meal deals. They are the following: A 6 strip combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, 1 side, 3 sauces, a garlic bread, and a drink (20 oz).  3 Strip Combo comes with 3 strips, 2 sauces, a garlic bread, and drink. (That's the one I usually get, as it's just the right amount of food and it's ohhh so good.) Lastly, the 2 strip meal which has 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce, and a kids sized drink (12 oz). \n- Here is the fun part. THE OPTIONS, YAY! You can get your chicken either baked, grilled, or fried. I'm a fan of their grilled chicken, since deep fried food doesn't like me. Their baked chicken is decent, but in my option grilled is the way to go. They have a good variety of sauces too, and oh man, if you like sauces, you'll like this place. What kind of sauces do they have, you ask? Well kids, here's a list: BBQ, Buffalo (one I always get), Strip Sauce, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream. I've tasted the Buffalo, Ranch, Strip Sauce, Cheese, and Teriyaki and I'm a fan. The teriyaki was a little weird and not one of my favorites, but it wasn't by any means horrible.  Oh yeah, you also get that side! Their sides are mac and cheese, french fries, or grilled veggies. Their mac and cheese is decent for fast food, and their french fries are pretty good as well. None of them are something to write home to mother about, but hey, you are coming here for the chicken anyway, right? I hope so. \n- Service: So far so good! The people working there are friendly, tell you about their loyalty program and like to make you smile. It can get busy during lunch so there is a little bit of wait time, but nothing compared to some places. \n\nI say try it once, at least for the sauces and chicken. Everything I've tasted there has been om nom nomable to the extreme and it has now became my go to place for chicken at work. :D Keep it classy Strip N Dip."

Baked, Fried, or Grilled. (BFG get it?)   The perfection of the chicken strip, what ever the cooking method  would easily make for a 5 star review, but wait, let's talk about the mac and cheese.  Bubbly hot, silky smooth and simply delicious. From the first mouth searing bite to the bitter end of licking the bowl clean, it is simply heaven. Woo-Hoo this sounds good, but wait, there is a another layer to drool over, the signature dipping sauces.   My personal favorite is the Wasabi cream.  Just enough heat to bring the tears, but so good you can't stop.  Bring  a straw and love the burn.  The thai sweet chili is very unique with a mild heat and a multitude of flavorful back tones. The honey mustard is subtle and is a nice counterpoint to the more powerful flavors mentioned above.  If you prefer something a bit more mellow,there are several more varieties for your consideration\n\nWe have perfectly prepared chicken, exceptional side dishes and incredible dipping sauces, what else could you ask for?

It almost doesn't seem possible (the close comparison always is Cane's, but I'll explain why that's an impossible comparison), but that's exactly what BFG has done with their Fried Chicken. It's almost unthinkable as to what madness occurred for this to be possible, but it's been done. Not only is their Fried chicken that moist, but pretty much everything else is as well. The Baked chicken strips were peppered with some seasonings and baked to perfection, it comes out very moist and tasty. I'm not one for Baked Chicken Strips, but I'd try it every once in awhile if it had come down to it.\n\nIn addition to the chicken, their sides are very well done. Naturally, if you like/love/adore/lust after Mac and Cheese, then dear god go for the Mac and Cheese; it's baked goodness in a tinfoil pie thing. Their salad was enjoyable, but if you're going there to get fried chicken in a salad, you really need to get some priorities in order and really just stop kidding yourself. \n\nNaturally the big kicker is their array of sauces. I'm officially a big fan of their \"BFG\" sauce, simply because it's got a bit of everything in the flavor spectrum in \"BBQ, spicy, and sweetness.\" None of that made sense, but that's the only way to describe it. Their Honey Mustard is something unique as well, so if y'all love it, go for it.\n\nAll in all, BFG is a chicken place that I might very well swap for Cane's from time to time, because (1) It's good food; it's good chicken... and (2) It's closer to me than Cane's. I mean, I'll still go to both equally (Cane's is open longer, so that's always a reason I won't abandon Cane's), but somehow BFG will make it into my routine.\n\n... oh, and having a stamp card helps too. (b^^)b =7\n\nSIDENOTE: So I was saying why you can't compare Cane's Fried Chicken with BFG Fried Chicken... I (personally, ie. MY OWN OPINION) believe that you can't compare two different styles of fried chicken strips. Cane's uses a batter of some sort, whereas BFG uses more Panko bread crumb-type food source. It's like comparing Apples and Oranges; useless. You just need to know that Cane's is good and BFG is good too. (b^^)b"

We were going to take our food to-go as BFG closes at 8pm, but the owner Jin was soo nice and understanding, he still let us eat-in. I mean the hospitality was AMAZING...and so was the food! Chicken strips can be easy to dry out, if not done right, but man...whether it was fried or baked these strips were always moist and seasoned just right. My boyfriend loved the fried because he loves panko breaded chicken :)  The mac n cheese....ohhh gooey cheesy goodness. Actually baked in the oven.\n\nwell, long story short, we were in town for less than 48 hours and we managed to come back and eat here twice! Thats how good it was. It was the best $6 meal I'd had for as far back as I can remember...\n\nThe simplicity of the meals is what makes this place best...The chicken is really the star here. Plus, the portions are perfect.  Fantastic food at a fantastic price...oh it was AWESOME.\n\nThanks Jin! Next time were in town, we'll be back  :D"

I had a bit of an addiction problem with this place a while back and he remembered me after not having gone there in at least 9 months if not a year. \n\n\nThis place is pretty awesome. For6 dollars you get chicken (BFG, which is what I will always call this place) , garlic bread, a side, and 2 delicious sauces. The honey mustard and strip sauce, ahem, I mean BFG sauce are the best IMO. The mac and cheese is also pretty good. As long as it isn't busy you get your food super fast. \n\nThe random special items have all been pretty good when I got them- nachos, hot dog thing, funnel cake- whats not to love? \n\nGood to go ordering- never got there after the allotted amount of time and had to wait, food was always ready. \n\nThey now have the 300 flavor coke machine which doesn't hurt either."

            "review": "Very simple yet diverse menu. They have three different ways they cook their chicken and they all taste great. No matter which way you get it, its healthy eating. They have grilled vegetables to go with your grilled or baked chicken which by the way is 100% real chicken, white meat at that. They have several different sauces and depending on what count of strips you order, you'll get your choice of either two or three sauces. \n\nThe customer service is what it should be anywhere you go. The food is great and the price is right, but I keep coming back because the owner makes it a point to know your name and if you're a first-timer, he'll ask if you'd like to have your picture taken and posted on social media, usually FB. The owner is a local kid in his mid-twenties and a graduate of UNLV who seems to have a passion for quality and not quantity. \n\nHe seems to be on point with staff selection because his staff is a reflection of him. They recenly expanded their menu to include deserts and other items. They have a very wide variety of soft drinks and healthy drinks. They have a reward program that they recently kicked off but I haven't had it long enough to give a review on it. \n\nThe establishment is always clean including the bathroom and the decor is appropriate. This is place you have to try at least once. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is because of the fact that the place is small. The bathroom is basically right in the middle of the place right off the dining area, which is probably why they maintain it so clean. I don't think the owner anticipated the popularity the place would gain but if things keep going the way they are they will need a bigger place."

This little place apparently remodeled, and the inside is very hip.  They have a fancy digital coke machine, and big trendy posters on the wall.  It feels like a restaurant down on the Strip.  If you have trouble finding it, it is next door to Home Depot, to the south.  \n\nI ordered the baked chicken strips, with the mac n cheese, and chose the wasabi and strip dip as my two dips, all under $8.  The chicken was juicy and tender, very good!  The mac n cheese was awesome, perfectly caramelized on top and not overly rich in the cheese department.  The sauces were bang on as well, especially the wasabi.  It was lightly sweet, but still gave that classic wasabi nostril burn! \n\nI am definitely coming back, especially considering it is pretty close to my house.  I want to try the fried chicken strips, but at the same time this is a good healthier alternative to my Raising Canes addiction.  I also met one of the new owners, a young man named Matt.  He was very friendly and obviously cares a lot about the quality of his establishment and getting the word out.  If you haven't tried Strip N Dip, give them a shot!"

G!\n\nI've been itching to come here for the longest time, but since it isn't close to my house, my visit has been delayed, but since my gf and I were on vacation for winter break, we placed BFG on our Go-To list and we should've placed it on our Go-To list a few more times!  After reading the rest of my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I already decided on what to order before I even went there.  And when my gf and I showed up here and ordered without even having to look at the menu twice, Jin, the co-owner, knew we were Yelpers!  How cool!\n\nI ordered the #2: Baked Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Sweet Chili and Cheese.  My gf ordered the #3: Fried Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Wasabi Cream and BFG sauce.  It was semi busy so Jin gave us a heads up that the food might take a minute and I thought that was cool that he was honest about it.  I saw the other owner, Tin, working up a sweat cooking in the back, but he was never too busy to give a welcoming smile and hello to everyone who came in.  I sat there and looked around and noticed how very welcoming and friendly Jin was with everyone who came in.  He called everyone by name and the best thing about it was that he remembered everyone!  He made sure everyone's drinks were full and had small talk with everyone like they were best friends!\n\nWhen we got our food, we dug right in! Wasabi cream and Sweet Chili is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!  Definitely memorable and kills my other favorite Cane Sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked because even if it was baked, it wasn't dry, but full of juice and flavor!  The mac and cheese was a great addition to the baked chicken and complemented my palette! After we devoured our food, we had some small talk with Jin and got to know him a little bit more.  He even asked to take our photo when we finished our food!\n\nThe best part about our visit to BFG wasn't just the delicious chicken and friends, but the hospitality and winning attitude shared by Jin and Tin!  I wish you the best of luck and look forward to the future surprises that BFG has to offer!  The food was soo good, I had to order some to-go to bring home for my mom to try! BFG, son! And wha!?"

My biggest gripe is that the price of garlic bread and extra sauce, just like the rent, is too damned high.\n\nIf you are selling $45 worth of chicken, charging fiddy cent extra for less than two tablespoons of sauce is ridiculous.

After we went on a super roundabout way to this place, thanks to her GPS, we found it. \n\nI've been wanting to try this place for... a really long time, but alas, I live in Henderson so I wasn't about to make a trek out for some chicken strips.

Jin remembered my name, thanked me for my previous Yelp review, and then we got down to business.  It was Monday at 6 PM and I don't know if this is a normal time for a restaurant to be busy, but they were fairly busy.  It really emphasized how small the place is, with just 5 tables and a small counter.  I saw a couple of customers peek their head in and say something like \"Oh they're so busy\" and immediately leave.  Shame, really. \n\nI got a grilled chicken combo with fries and also got the weekly special, chicken nachos.  I'm a food nit so I got the nachos without pico de gallo, onions, or sour cream.  Still, though, they were excellent and a larger serving size than I expected.  The tortilla chips aren't overly salty, the cheese reminds me of Taco Bell nacho cheese (a good thing IMO), the beans and chicken add some flavor and texture.  Note that the chicken is shredded and seasoned -- it's not large chunks like if they had cut up some of their strips.  I think Jin should add nachos (with or without cheese) to his menu as a side item permanently, rather than rotating the weekly specials.  The grilled chicken strips are great.  I felt like they were smaller than the big fried strips I got the first time I was there, but the taste was great. \n\nService, as usual, was great and fast.  Prices are excellent, as usual -- less than $10 for the combo and the weekly special combined.  What more could you want?  Too bad it's a 25 minute drive for me :("

Very crispy on the outside, but tender on the inside!  The mac n' cheese is phenomenal!  Order it!  One of my lactose intolerant friends goes bananas for it and says it's worth the pain!  I also ordered the fries.  They're not amazing, but they are satisfying (thin cut).  Got two funnel cakes before heading out!  One was strawberry and the other was chocolate!  They are small in size so I don't recommend splitting one between more than two people (unless you're counting calories...)."

The eclectic menu has something to offer for all. If you feel like binging, get the fried strips with Mac n cheese on the side. If you want to be healthy, go with baked with a side of veggies. \n\nI personally think the baked and fried are the best strips. The wasabi cream sauce is delicious. They also have Thai tea. Yay."

Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..\n\nMy only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits \"extra\" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right? I ordered the 6 piece chicken strip meal and ran out of sauce with there limit of 3 small dipping sauce sides.\n\nAnyhow, it was good,  I just did not get the happy ending I had been hoping for...\n\nThis goes in my overrated file.... :("

Ah, so I consulted Yelp and up came Strip N Dip. I remember bookmarking this one awhile ago as BFG Chicken Strips. Apparently the restaurant has gone through some changes since then, and it had a stint where it was closed, but - it is back open and man, is it good.\n\nThe location is a little odd, tucked into a shopping center sandwiched between Albertsons and Home Depot. It is small, few tables and a bar, with a few tables for outdoor seating. But the inside is cool with vibrant posters and a digital menu reader board. \n\nMy husband and I both opted for the fried 4-strip meal with the baked mac and cheese. The mac and cheese reminded me of a little personal pizza sitting in my basket. When I dug in its ooey-gooeyness and delicious cheesiness was sublime! I think more people should put cheese over macaroni like they do. \n\nAs for the strips - absolutely perfectly done. Juicy and tender on the inside yet fried to a crispy, but not hard outside. The panko breading I really enjoyed, my husband said he would have rather had a normal batter-like outside like Cane's does. *shrugs* Dipping sauces - I went with the Strip Sauce, of course, had to try that one and it is very good and addicting. And I opted for the buffalo because I wanted a bit of heat. Both good, but next time I'm definitely going for that wasabi one. \n\nThe service was SO NICE! These guys are really trying hard to make customers feel very welcome. You could even say it is a familial vibe here.\n\nIf you like Cane's, you must try Strip N Dip. Just for an alternative because they are really doing chicken strips right."

The restaurant is in a strip mall near Home Depot and it can be easily missed.  Just drive along all the stores until you hit a square chicken head on a blue awning.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple:\n\n1.  First you choose your combo, 2 pieces, 4 pieces,  or 6 pieces.  If you have 3 or more people the party platter of 20 seems like a good deal.  \n\n2.  Then you choose your type of chicken.  BFG baked, fried, or grilled.  The baked chicken was my fave, tender and moist.  The fried had a delicious panko crust.  The grilled seemed like the healthiest of the bunch.  \n\n3.  Next you choose your sauces.  This is when it gets fun.  The teriyaki goes well with the grilled.  The wasabi cream is unique sauce that is pretty popular.  My fave sauces have to be the regular BBQ and Ranch.  I love double dipping into those two and making it a mixture.  \n\n4.  Get a side.  Grilled veggies, baked macaroni and cheese, or fries.  The veggies were well seasoned and the baked mac and cheese was super cute in a baby pie tin haha.  \n\n5.  Last get your drink.  \n\nVery reasonably priced for good quality chicken strips.  The customer service here is great too!  The sauces definitely make the meal.  An awesome place to pick up some appetizers for a party.  I would definitely consider a party platter next time I have to bring something over to someone's house.\n\nP.S. You can add any type of chicken strip to your combo for $1 each."

The chicken strips here are, obviously, served 3 ways...\n\nI have tried fried & grilled and I am impressed with the flavor.  The wasabi cream dipping sauce is divine.  As for sides, I have tried & enjoyed only the grilled veggies (2 skewers of zucchinni, onions, & grape tomatoes) and the baked macaroni & cheese.  Again, very good flavor & 2 kinds of cheese on the mac & cheese.  The other item I have tasted isn't strictly in the BFG category : the Chicken Nachos.  Refer to Angela H.'s review on this item of which I wholeheartedly agree.  After I have tried more items and the quality remains consistent, I'll probably upgrade my rating to 5/5...\n\nLast visit here I went with a 2 strip combo. This comes with 2 chicken strips (duh), one side, a dipping sauce, & a 12oz drink for $4.95 (I think).  I decided on the healthy route & got grilled strips (with some type of lightly sweet Asian marinade) and the grilled vegetables.  The taste was outstanding. \n\nThe owner came out, knew the person I was with and remembered my face from my last visit.  He really wanted to know my name and it seems he is genuinely interested in pleasing his customers.\n\nLastly, it is open until 10 pm every day, so you can get your eat on relatively late."

I've never tried the fried strips, but the grilled and baked strips are both juicy and flavorful with their respected marinades.  The Mac & Cheese was on point, as usual; browned top layer of mozzarella covering a generous portion of creamy, cheesy macaroni.  The garlic toast is just so-so, but a thoughtful addition to the meal. I've tried most of the sauces, and I have to say that the Wasabi Cream is by far the best.  The Teriyaki is also a good compliment.  I plan to try the honey-mustard on my next visit!  I want to try the grilled veggies also... They look incredible, but I can never bring myself to part with the Mac & Cheese!"

I made the suggestion to my boss to eat here for lunch and she happily agreed.  Considering we always order to go, I placed a call for pick up.  Towards of the end of the conversation, the cashier over the phone advised me it would be ready in six minutes.  Whoa!  Wait a minute, I'm about a good 15 minutes away!  He was kind enough to tell the cooks to start cooking six minutes before I arrive.  \n\nOff I went immediately after I hung up the phone.  Almost there I thought, however I got lost.  Who gets lost in Charleston and Rainbow?  Because I couldn't find the place, I made a few u-turns and finally decided to go towards Home Depot.  Yup, there it was hiding next to Home Depot.  That hardware retail store has a way of keeping any small establishments from being seen on Rainbow Road.\n\nLuckily, it wasn't swamped with a ton of people like I thought it would be.  I walked straight in and there were a few people seated and another few lined up to order.  It was awesome how the cashier would talk to each customer as if he's known them for a while.  First names of each customer were said at least three times before they were done ordering.  That's very impressive.  But, that is the difference between a mom and pop's shop and a big corporation fast food chain.  It's more personal.\n\nMy boss and I ordered the same lunch, #4, Build Your Own!  We decided to get four fried strips, baked Mac and cheese, garlic bread, two sauces, and regular drink all for $5.75 plus tax.  :D  I was excited to take this back to the office and just devour it as the aroma was teasing me and calling out my name.\n\nAs soon as I got back to the office, we sat down and I just delved in as though I hadn't eaten in a month. What can I say?  I love to pig out.  To describe my meal:  A swirl of rainbows just came over me as I bit in to the chicken strip.  The breading was so lightly crisp and the meat was just so tender; the seasoning, was just right.  It didn't even need sauce, but I got the BFG sauce which is like a Thousand Island dressing with more zest to it and Ranch.  Mmmmm... you are just so yummy!  I'm still imagining it right now.  The baked Mac and cheese was heavenly too with gooey cheese of awesomeness!  That garlic bread was one of the best garlic breads I've had with lots of flavor and the right texture when biting in to it.  I'm closing my eyes as I'm typing this and reminiscing Tuesday's lunch.  \n\nMy boss even said, \"Good call on lunch!\"  Yup, I got brownie points that day.  Thank you BFG!  Now I have to figure out what to eat for lunch today.  I hope it'll be equal or top this lunch."

The Gentleman at the counter, Jin was Extremely Personable and guessed that I was a Yelper! Haha, nice. I found that he was the owner and his partner/owner, Tin was handling the backend/cooking. I did go with the Combo #1 with Grilled Chicken Tenders/Strips with the Wasabi Cream sauce and the suggested Sweet Chili sauce. It also came with Mac N Cheese, a slice of Garlic Bread and a Drink. All for under 6 bucks, Not bad.. Then, ordered their Special of the Day: \"Hot Chick\" - fried chicken tender, in a hotdog bun with their hot sauce and veggies.. Plus, I ordered a side of their baked chicken tenders and fried chicken tenders (just to have a taste of all the chicken variety they offered). And I also tried their buffalo and ranch sauces too.\n\nMy take on the items:\n\nBaked Chicken Tenders: 3.5 Stars. Tasted healthy but didn't have much flavor.. The sauce took care of it though.\n\nGrilled Chicken Tenders: 4/5 Stars. Mildly flavored, a bit sweet and tasty.\n\nFried Chicken Tenders: 5/5 Stars. The Breading (Panko?) was absolutely delicious with the chicken. Like a Tempura Chicken Tender!\n\nWasabi Cream Sauce: 3.5/5 Stars. Unique and mild wasabi flavor. Nice and creamy but didn't Wow me like I was expecting.\n\nSweet Chili Sauce: 4/5 Stars. Sweet, a tiny bit spicy , like a teriyaki type sauce. This was pretty good.\n\nBuffalo and Ranch Sauces: 3/5 Stars. Both decent, as expected\n\nHot Chick (special): 3.5/5 Stars Think of Fried Chicken Tender hot dog with hot sauce and veggies. Not bad. But it did make me order more Fried Chicken Tenders!\n\nMac N Cheese: 4/5 Stars, Easy. Not the Best I've had but Way Better than KFC's! I think there were a couple different cheeses working together with that Nacho cheese oozing in the middle of it all! I'm a Fan!\n\nService was Superb, No Question! For a place like this, I never would of expected to feel like a V.I.P.! I think Jin asked me twice if I wanted a refill for my drink but Annie (the wife of Tin, the other owner) was quick to give me a refill before and after Jin already asked me.. Also, follow ups on the food and.. It goes on.. The Food and Value was better than Average. This Local Business Got My Support!!"

The panko breading was so light and crispy.  Mix in a little wasabi cream sauce and you will be in heaven.\n\nIf you are looking for something light, they offer grilled strips with grilled vegetables.  I didn't try these because I can't say no to fried chicken with mac and cheese.  All the combos come with yummy garlic bread. TVs were playing the football game.  What else can you ask for really?"

For sides you have a choice of mac and cheese, fries or grilled veggies. My personal favorite is the grilled veggies which are zucchini, onion and tomato. They are incredibly fresh and a rather great compliment to the chicken fingers. For the fingers themselves, they are made of great tasting white meat but at the same time do not have much taste. The real magic is in the restaurant's choices of sauce. Depending on your meal, you can choose either two or three sauces from their menu of over 10 sauces. My absolute favorite is the sweet chili sauce. \n\nIf you're in the area and looking for a break from the conventional fast food chicken finger, give Strip N Dip a try!"

But in all honesty, let's get one thing straight. You cannot compare the two. I mean, you can but they aren't the same animal. SND has more options for sure... And they both have crispy chicken that relies on their sauces for overall flavor. So, there you have it. Just my two cents.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n-Crispy panko crust. Hot and juicy. Practically burned my tongue off. \n-They are never frozen, meaning it's fresh.\n-I like having options. Want to be a tad bit more healthy? Order it grilled. Maybe baked.\n-Grilled veggies? Yup! We had a vegan and vegetarian in our party so they liked that!\n-Staff. So friendly! They even took an Instagram photo of our party.\n\nWhat was okay:\n-I thought the Mac & Cheese was on the runny side. So sue me! I loved the cheesy meltyness on top, but I didn't like cracking open the inside.\n-The sauces. Not terrible. Might give the wasabi cream a try next time!"

And boy was I a happy camper once I got my delicious lunch!\n\nAs the name states, you can get chicken strips baked, fried, or grilled.  I went for fried because is there really a choice when fried is an option?  So I ordered the 4 piece combo and went for the mac n' cheese as a side.  I was with my mom who ordered the same except went for the fries, so I got to sample both.  \n\nThe mac n' cheese, as stated in so many other reviews, is simply amazing!  It was cheesy heaven with a bit of pasta thrown in to make it easier to eat.  Yummy!  The fries were right on as well.  Great crispy fries without being too crunchy.  They also have grilled veggies, but if it's healthy, I never get it, so I can't comment on that side option.\n\nA great addition to the food were the numerous dipping sauce choices.  I love dipping stuff into other stuff. The more dipping options I have, the better!  I heart condiments.  With that being said, BFG has 9 sauces to pick from to dip your delicious chicken into.  We went with the BFG, BBQ, Honey Mustard, and Ranch sauces.  All were good but I do have to say the BFG sauce really complimented the chicken nicely.  As for the Honey Mustard, they must put crack in it, because I am addicted.  I don't even need to dip anything in it because I think I would drink it, if I could.  I'm a classy chick, can't you tell?\n\nSo yes, BFG Chicken Strips is a great hole in the wall place.  If you are in the area or love good chicken fingers, go check them out."

For the amount and quality of the food I got, I am certainly impressed and satisfied. \n Their grilled chicken was flavorful and the chili and wasabi sauce I chose went awesome with it. I got an additional side of the mac and cheese, which was a big mass of cheesy goodness. Oh man, I can't wait to come back and try their other types of chicken strips and sauces.\n So I definitely suggest anyone who's hungry and on a budget to give this place a shot, because it might just become your new best friend. I think it might have just become one of mine! Woo HOO! Thanks BFG for being nice to my wallet and my stomach. *high five*"

(Yes, human being are still capable of walking, believe it or not.) This is where the locals go, I had heard, but I was a local and I had never heard of it (or the former owner Jin). \n\nIn any case, they changed their name (unrelated to Jin) and subsequently included desserts to their very basic menu. It just so happened to be a dessert I yearn for on a regular -- unnaturally, regular really -- basis: funnel cake (2.25$). Score!\n\nAnd their chicken is ultimately delectable. I prefer the Baked, then the Grilled, and finally the Fried. BGF. Always get the 6-piece (8.79$, as of this writing). The mac & cheese tastes so delicious, it makes me want to become a fan of mac & cheese (I am not). They have a bunch of sauces as well but I do not mess with anything besides cheddar cheese (is this the only place that has it?) and barbecue, since it is all that is truly needed in life.  \n\nThe service is so friendly, personable, and funny, they make you want to return sooner than you intended. The loyalty programme has teeth too: there is a place for your birthday and anniversary (it could be your Yelpversary if you have no partner!) online and succeeding completion of your first survey, it should be only one more visit to go before receiving your complimentary Four-Strip Meal. How cool is that? \n\nSDCS does not have the same roll of the tongue as BFG (Fuck Bone Grill), but there is room for some SDCC (ComicCon) parodying when it is that time of year (especially with the nerd [comic] store next door). \n\nNeedless to say, I vociferously recommend this business.

Weather you order it baked, grilled or fried, it will be served hot, cooked and still moist inside. And Jin is seriously a master at friendly and personable customer service.\n\nIt is not rocket science, but when restaurants can deliver the winning combination of serving good food + exceptional customer service, it pretty much means the customer will have an awesome experience.  And for someone that dines out daily it really is a refreshing change to dine somewhere that do all the important things right. \n\nI tried Combo #1 (maybe not the \"healthy\" combo, but it certainly does pack a lot of tasty flavor).  The fried chicken strips were very good (my second favorite).  I also ordered 2 strips each of the baked and grilled chicken strips, just so I  can do a little taste test and find out my preferences.  I really love the grilled chicken, it has nice flavor and was nice and juicy.  The baked chicken was good, but came in last for me when compared to its grilled and fried brethren.\n\nAbout the restaurant, it is small but still perfect for accommodating patrons dropping by for a quick meal break from work or school or the modern day hunter gathers here to pick up a little something for the rest of the family units impatiently waiting at home.  It has WiFi, in case you want to surf the web/blog about your visit on your new iPad 2 while you get some nourishment.  It is located in a large strip mall, so parking should not be an issue.\n\nTinh and Jin's Mom + staff, runs the kitchen, while Jin mans the cash register and handles customer service, 12 hr/day, 6-days a week. Pretty tough schedule running a small restaurant, but they do a great job!\n\nFood: 5/5 They have the techniques down when it comes to making chicken strips.\nService: 5/5  There are more than one way to provide awesome service, and BFG has certainly mastered it.  I think even more established restaurants or potential restaurateurs can learn a thing or two about what great customer service is here.\nLocation:  Close to the Rainbow exit on the 95.\nParking: 5/5  The parking lot is large, it should not be a problem."

I got the baked chicken (it was just kinda wet and slimy and the flavor didn't wow me at all), mac and cheese (mostly bubbly cheese, which tasted alright but too much for my guts), garlic bread (overwhelmingly garlic-y), honey mustard (not the best but also alright), and sweet chili (blech). \n\nI am NOT a picky eater, but this was just a bummer. Maybe the fried strips are better? Maybe I should have tried the wasabi sauce people rave about? I don't know... Money is tight these days, so if I'm going out for lunch it better be good. I won't be rushing back for sure.\n\nThe best things about the place? Fanta in bottles (which I noticed AFTER I ordered) and the very friendly service. They have that down to a science!"

The staff is friendly and enthusiastic, and want you to enjoy what they know will be the best chicken strips you will have. The choices are limited but you can make so many different combinations that almost anyone can find a meal that works for them. They have a Coke freestyle machine which I love and Gold Peak tea too. The chicken comes baked, fried, or grilled and there are a delightful array of sauces. All the food here is delicious it just depends on what you want. If you are not in the mood for strips then let me recommend the nachos. They are cheap just like everything else on the menu and really good. You can get them to combine two orders into one massive nacho extravaganza. (I have never regretted this decision, although I don't always finish it.) All the sides are good but the mac and cheese is the perfect combination of delicious melty cheese and gooey cheese sauce, it's the perfect gourmand blend of cheap and delicious that you crave for comfort food.  I recommend the wasabi cream sauce, sweet chili and the house strip sauce. Enjoy!"

I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. \"This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural\"...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?\n\nI was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.\n\nChicken:\nYou choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5\n\nSide Dishes:\nThey have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5\n\nSauces:\nYour options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5"

The chicken was really moist especially considering the fact it was baked. Also, nicely seasoned. The mac n cheese was absolutely amazing.  Gooey texture, while not being too overwhelmingly cheesey. Although I would of liked it more of there was some crunchy texture on top like crumbled crackers or something?  It actually came out piping hot, which I loved. The sauces were great as well especially since I'm a sauce kinda guy. BFG definitely beats Canes. I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken strips.

My fianc\u00e9 and I took a trip to Vegas this past weekend and after a long 4 hour drive from Cali, we were definitely ready to eat some good food. I personally was craving mac n cheese so we decided to look on yelp and happened to come across Strip N Dip - we were sold by the pictures! As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by friendly workers. I ordered the mac n cheese but wasn't sure if it would be enough food since it was a side dish, so I was on the fence about ordering the chicken nachos. The sweet lady at the cashier (didn't catch her name) recommended the chicken fries that were not on the menu. Let me just say I HIGHLY recommend the chicken fries to anyone who loves carne asada fries. I would seriously make the trip back out to Vegas from Cali JUST for those fries. The mac n cheese was incredible too (I'm very picky about my mac n cheese and I ended up buying a second serving in the same sitting). We were so impressed by the food here that we came back the next day and were lucky enough to meet Matt Boghos the owner! Matt was friendlier than can be and made us feel like he genuinely cared about the well being of his customers AND workers (which is very rare to find in this day and age). I even needed to charge my phone and he brought out a portable phone charger for me and treated us with a chocolate funnel cake (wow!) Matt was very humble and gracious, and it was very clear that he treated his workers well. My fianc\u00e9 and I were so impressed by the quality customer service here and will definitely be returning next time we're in Vegas! In fact, we hope Strip N Dip makes it's way out to California so that we can be regular customers! ;) Thank you Matt and all your friendly coworkers for making us feel so special!"

Count me in! \n\nName has changed from BFG to Strip n Dip Chicken Strips, I'm assuming from change of owner? BFG logo is still on the big banner above the front door when I visited so just spot for that when you're looking for the place.\n\nOnto the food: Delish! Ordered the Fried, Fries w/ Teri Sauce & Strip Sauce while the boyfriend opted for Baked, Mac n Cheese w/ Wasabi Cream & Sweet Chili. \n\nChicken was moist & tender. Can't go wrong with panko breading either! Fries were crispy not soggy just how I like it. Pretty good portion for the Mac n Cheese too. Considering you have garlic bread to devour as well. \n\nThe sauces were all so good, it was like a game which one I'd dip into. As everyone here says, wasabi cream was the best. Immediate wasabi flavor but dissipates afterwards which I appreciate so it's not too overwhelming.\n\nAll in all, great experience! Can't wait to go back and try the other sauces! Lol"

If it's baked, fried or grilled you're looking for, they have it here. I had to go with fried, as I wasn't on my eternal diet at the time, I can't tell if they use panko or what but whatever it is, it's delicious. Tried the wasabi cream to dip it in and mac & cheese for my side, this was an all around comfort food win."

The coating on fried strips are light and flaky, exactly how anything battered really should be. We sampled their wasabi cream (yum), buffalo, ranch and the BFG sauces...all delish!\n\nTheir french fries are amazing.  The Hubs was giving me a stink eye the entire time since I was hijacking those fried potato morsels and in reality, I should have opted for the less healthier choice rather than their grilled veggies (I'm not a fan of onions!).\n\nThe garlic bread is yummy, very nicely flavored.  \n\nA big standout really (aside from the food) is service.  I am not high maintanence by any means but I really did enjoy having Jin come by and check on us.  I noticed that he greeted everyone that walked in and took the time to chat with the patrons in there which made it such \"welcome to our place\" feeling.  THAT you have to love.  Jin gets major props for just being awesome.\n\nWould be come back?  Yes we have to now since our lil man tasted the mac and cheese and the the strips and is addicted now.  And for the record, now that we are back home, our lil guy was more than happy to know he had some chicken strips to bring for lunch to school."

When you think of chicken strips, what comes to mind is deep fried battered chicken strips. Traditionally, that's what has always been known. \n\nBut then this place turns it up a notch, actually two notches, not just by offering you FRIED, but also GRILLED and BAKED as well. \n\nIt's not just your typical battered fried, but they use PANKO breading, which makes it very crispy on the outside while it stays juicy on the inside. \n\nAt first I thought the GRILLED would be kind of dry, but with the first bite, I was pleasantly suprised at how tender and juicy it was with the taste of Asian marinade and honey.\n\nSame goes for the BAKED. It has a wonderful rotisserie flavor to it.\n\nAs for the sides, you have BAKED MAC N CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES, and GRILLED VEGGIES. You can't go wrong with these selections but make sure at least one of your choices is the baked mac n cheese. Not only is it what you expect, but they also put MOZZARELLA on top of it!\n\nOf course you gotta have a sauce to dip you chicken strips in so here's the lowdown.\nYou get your choice of 9 sauces. (in alphabetical order)\n\n1. Barbeque\n2. BFG\n3. Buffalo\n4. Cheese \n5. Honey Mustard\n6. Ranch\n7. Sweet Chili\n8. Teriyaki\n9. Wasabi Cream\n\nThese are all self explantory except for BFG and Wasabi Cream.\nThe BFG is there secret signature sauce comparable to Raising Canes. The Wasabi Cream tastes just like a sweet, cream cheese type of sauce with just a little bit of spicy kick of wasabi.\n\nSince this is the only location in existence, any time you are in the area, try to take advantage if you are close by. If you are gonna dine in be aware that they only have about 6 tables inside and about 3 tables outside. They are located to the left of Home Depot.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anybody. Service was nice and they get your food out to you pretty quick. The one only negative I can say is that the strips are just a tad bit small. If you are really hungry, you just might have to order extra strips or sides to compensate. \n\nSo what are you doing still reading this review? Go already! What are you, chicken? LOL."

I have say his customer service skills rivals the folks down the street at  Komex,....perhaps even better than them.\n\nI love their concept of baking, Frying, or Grilling chicken. because this one place you can have it your way...sorry Burger King, I had to do it.     Well, I choose the fried chicken strip combo with french fries, Garlic bread, and a diet Pepsi; and added the Mac and Cheese to this order.\n\nMy order didn't take too long, and this Chicken Katsu inspired combo was pretty good.    My chicken found themselves being soaked in Ranch and Teriyaki sauce, and sauce were good, but I kind of wished there was some Katsu sauce in house.  \nThe Mac and Cheese had a nice touch of being baked, and had enough cheese to fatten whale....damn, it was great., and the Garlic bread was a nice touch..\n\nMy feeling what separate this restaurant from the other Chicken joints in Vegas is Jin, the owner;  he's the person who make you want to come back and patronize this business.   More than a few Las Vegas business owners should take notes and visit BFG; they might learn a great lesson from this business.      Good job, and will be back soon."

For you wasabe peeps, you'll love that wasabe cream sauce.

The breading here reminds me of what you find on katsu, just a light amount of panko crumbs. The chicken to breading ratio is the best I've found outside of a sit down restaurant. And the sides are great. \n\nThe mac and cheese is super popular and if you like mac and cheese, I'm sure you'll like theirs. If you want fries, they'll give you way more fries than one person should consume. And the fries walk the line between crispy outside and soft inside. The grilled veggies are actually better than a lot of the veggies you'd get at a sit down restaurant. \n\nI haven't tried all the sauces but I tend to get honey mustard every time. Don't over think it with the sauces. Get what you know you like. The tenders are the star here. \n\nOverall, there's a lot of sit down restaurants with good chicken tenders. If I were to make a best chicken tenders of las Vegas list, it would probably include a lot of dive bars and single $ restaurants because, chicken-wise, you'd likely get more bang for your buck there.

No.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Strip n Dip simply has the best to offer from every aspect whatsoever, including the quality, the taste, the service, and even the value. I first went to this restaurant with a recommendation of a friend based on the Baked Macaroni and Cheese, and it surely didn't disappoint. Nice crispy edges, and extra cheddar inside meant the macaroni was scrumptious and baked to perfection. Some of my friends think it needs a bit more flavor, but I'm personally satisfied. Another side star are Strip N Dip's french fries, which are McDonald's-sized but with crisper edges and great flavor. But of course, how could I forget the chicken? Strip N Dip's chicken strips come in three options: fried, baked, and grilled. All, somehow, are great on their own merits. Personally, I (like others) prefer the fried strips, as their panko breading adds texture and flavor to the already great tasting meat. For those on a stricter diet, guests are given the option of baked strips or grilled strips. Baked strips come with a sort of red seasoning that gives the chicken a taste of its own, while grilled strips are left alone, making it a chicken canvass for many of Strip N Dip's great tasting sauces. The honey mustard is extremely high quality, and the wasabi is fantastic for any spice fans. I also had a Thai Tea which was pretty good, but kind of odd compared to the rest of the menu.\n\nStrip n Dip also shines with its incredible service. Every employee is happy to be there and eager to learn if you're a new customer. They'll give you their own recommendations and ultimately make the experience that much more wonderful. The best thing? 6 strips, 2 sides, and a drink all can be had for under $10. Somewhat comparable to Cane's, but with chicken that actually has flavor. It's an awesome place and I can't wait to try their hot chicks!"

They just fried up scallops and fake crab sticks instead....sorry back to the chicken! It was crispy and tender on the inside. I tried the Wasabi and the Honey Mustard sauce. I enjoyed the Honey Mustard more because it wasn't bitter like the Wasabi. I also loved the veggie kabobs which were full of flavor! I ordered the Mac and Cheese as an additional side but I couldn't finish it. It was creamy and cheesy but too salty for me. I just have a low tolerance to salt.\n\nI liked the idea that you can come here with someone  who is health conscious aka my husband. You can totally order healthy items like grilled chicken and veggies. It's a great alternative to typical fast food places like KFC."

One night there was a special request for chicken fingers, which resulted in me bookmarking BFG for future enjoyment, since the thought of panko-breaded fingers was too much for her to handle.\n\nLast night the hubster and I were in the area, and decided to finally give it a try. We ordered a four and two finger combo, with four fried fingers and two baked fingers, one mac & cheese, fries, and three sauces - BBQ, BFG, and wasabi cream.\n\nI wish we would have had a dozen of the baked fingers - they were honestly that good. Extremely moist, well-seasoned, and flavorful. They were even better with a bit of the wasabi cream (although I was hoping that the sauce would be slightly more pungent.\n\nThe fried fingers were a little disappointing. They were definitely crispy, and still moist, but I was surprised by the blandness. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard, but the BFG sauce was too sweet and 1000 Island-esq for my liking. The cheesy crust on the mac & cheese was nice, but I thought the noodles/sauce needed more seasoning.\n\nOverall, this is a solid place, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood - specifically to get the baked fingers, wasabi cream, and probably the grilled veggies."

It was an extremely small place, and I only worried about finding a seat once I got my food. The tables were all filled up. The cashier, very attractive cashier Jin asks for your name to call you when the food is done. \n\nThe food didn't take long, and a table came open just in time. Perfect timing! \n\nThe handsome cashier walked around the tables asking if everyone was ok and enjoying themselves, and also cleaning up. As he walked by me, he asks me by name if everything is ok. He remembered my name from the order. He said \"You forgot an important part of the meal\" and brought me napkins I had forgotten. Now talk about customer service!  I was already wanting to visit this place again just by that humble moment lol. \n\nThe food was hot and delicious. It seemed like such a small portion, but once you started eating it filled you quickly. It began getting busy and I can see why. This food was excellent and affordable. It was such a simple place, and seemed to be doing just fine with business. I hope to see more of them all over Vegas one day. \n\nI am a fan and will return."

We approached the counter with our three daughters, who were very excited that a restaurant's main entree was chicken strips. The cashier/order-taker is by far the nicest person in Vegas, though there are lots of nice people there (he wasn't wearing a name tag). He asked us if we'd been there before (first time), thanked us for coming in & quickly explained the menu as well as offered suggestions. \nWe ordered the Family Meal and per his suggestion split the chicken strips three ways: fried, grilled and baked. The meal came with four sides so we again went with his suggestion: 3 homemade, baked macaroni & 1 french frie(s). It also came with 5 slices of garlic bread and lots of homemade sauces. There are only four tables inside but we were able to snag one and eat in.\nAll three \"types\" of strips were really good! None of them were dry. My husband really liked the wasbi cream, I think their buffalo is great. Their baked macaroni was a hit from our toddler to us parents. \nI'm a people watcher (okay, yes an eavesdropper!) and noticed that the cashier was super nice & helpful to everyone that came in. Seriously, having such awesome customer service makes patrons come back for great food or try a second time. :)"

They also have baked and grilled chicken (the B and the G of BFG).  They also have several choices of sauce, honey mustard, ranch, BFG (their take on russian), BBQ, and several others.\nToo bad their garlic bread is a small oval piece of buttered bread with garlic salt on top.

The grilled chicken was delicious, I liked the panko breaded crispy ones and we ordered a bunch of sauces but none of them stood out like the creamy wasabi did. I honestly just want to go there and order a tub of that stuff so I can slather it on whatever I eat at home and other restaurants. Their grilled vegetables still had a lot of crisp to them (which I appreciate) and their french fries were......I can't remember. They're french fries. They were hot, crispy, and they had carbs.\n\nI liked that the macaroni and cheese has a crusty top, but when I ate a spoonful of it, it really didn't blow me away. I mean it's faaaaaaar from being the disgusting kraft mac and cheese with the gross cheese powder, but I feel like the Velveeta Shells Mac N' Cheese is better.\n\nAlthough they were pretty tasty, I didn't really leave the place excitingly planning out my next visit.

It's a pretty small place with a few tables, but it wasn't very busy when we arrived.  I ordered four individual strips so we could try all of them, while she ordered the grilled strips meal with a side of mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was really good!  The cheese on top was baked well, and the cheese inside was very creamy.  It's probably fake cheese, but I like fake cheese.  The strips themselves were very moist but a little small.  We tried the bakes, fried, and grilled strips.  My favorite was, of course, the fried.  The batter was light and crisp - I think someone said the breading is panko?  We got two sauce, the Chili Thai and the BFG sauce, which is similar to Thousand Island.  The Chili Thai sauce was dark brown rather than red and had a kick to it, but it was good.  I liked it more than the BFG sauce.  However, I do think that the sauce at Raisin' Cane's is the best.  We also ordered the Thai Ice Coffee.  My friend really liked it bc it wasn't very sweet, whereas I had to put more sugar in mine.  Thai Iced Coffee is  usually pretty sweet, but this one wasn't.  Overall, it was a good meal for under $7, though if you're hungry, you better order a bunch of strips!"

The chicken can be prepared one of three ways (fried, grilled, baked) and I really liked the baked chicken strips. As for my dips, I'm a huge fan of SPICY, so naturally got the buffalo sauce and hot wasabi sauce. The buffalo sauce was my favorite. Loved dipping my strips!\n\nFor my sides, the individually baked mac n cheese was delicious, and the garlic bread was generously seasoned. I have no complaints about my meal. The 4pc option was filling enough for me, and I was pretty hungry. I'm just super impressed by how good this place is!"

What? Boo!  Instead of stopping at BFG, I ate at several other mediocre spots in the area. Shame on me for being a HATER!\n\nA few weeks ago, one of my coworkers had lunch at her desk and it smelled terrific. I peeked in, and asked what she was eating. She told me she was eating grilled chicken and veggies from BFG. She then proceeded to tell me that you can order your chicken baked, fried, or grilled. I then made it a point to review it on yelp and noticed all the wonderful reviews this place received.\n \nThis past weekend, my family and I wanted to try something different. I suggested BFG, and off we went. At this point, I still didn't put it together that the place I was searching for was the same place I dissed time and time again. \nWhen we pulled up, I was like oh -this place? We ran in because it was freezing cold outside, and ordered the family special. \n\nWe ordered 10 fried strips, 5 baked, and 5 grilled. I can't even make an argument on which version was better. I loved them all equally--just like my kids!  The baked chicken was seasoned perfectly, and no dipping sauces were needed.   I added a dash of hot sauce to the grilled chicken and I was in heaven. The best thing about eating the fried strips was the Chile sauce that was available for dipping. Oh man-that was good! \n\nThe sides were good too! The baked mac n cheese was done perfectly, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The garlic bread was mediocre, but who cares!  I have never seen my kids eat so fast.... \n\nCo-owner Matt was super friendly and even gave us a sample of their chicken nachos to try! He mentioned that they were starting to cater on the side. Immediately, my wife booked him for our daughter's birthday in February. Oh, and my Son's birthday in April! Sorry Matt--you asked for it! \n\nI love this place! Chicken strips at their best!"

Customer service is incredibly important to me and the owner did a fine job of building rapport.  I am a fan of the BFG and sweet chili sauce which complemented the baked chicken well.

The Husband has been loving this place since I brought him here (thanks Yelp!) and he can't get enough!\n\nBFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.  \n\nThe menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.\n\nWith five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy. \n\nTheir fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.\n\nOf course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.\n\nAnd there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!\n\nAnother perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!  \n\nAnd finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.\n\nI also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.  \n\nTheir only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!"

Very cheesy and a great crust of cheese on top.  Could have used a little more salt though.  Garlic bread could have just been left out.  Nothing special there.  \n\nDipping sauces were the best part of the meal.  The wasabi cream was the best.  The sweet chili dipping sauce and the honey mustard had great flavor.  The BFG sauce was just a plain old fry sauce with a little extra acid. \n\nOverall a great meal.  We will be back."

Seems like a mom n' pop shop with great chicken strips. Service is friendly and fast with simple menu. \n\nI went with their 6-piece chicken strip combo ($9.70 with tax) which comes with small piece of bread, a choice of side (baked mac n'cheese, fries or veggies) and 3 choices of sauce. For side, I went ahead with baked mac n' cheese that everyone and their dog raved about. As for sauce, I decided to try bbq, strip sauce and ranch. \n\nThey have 3 different options for their chicken strips. I got the baked one which is rotisserie style, but they also have fried which has panko breading and grilled option for more healthy choice. \n\nBaked chicken had light seasoning and went well with all 3 sauces I got. Mac n' cheese was cheesy and good. I wish the piece of garlic bread they provided was a bigger piece. Perfect size to feed the pigeon walking around but not enough for a starving human being. \n\nGreat comfort food.

Strip n Dip is located right next to Home Depot. \n\nCame here for lunch. They had combos with six, four or two chicken strips. It comes with your choice of one side. Drinks NOT included. Customer service was great. I told the cashier this was my first time here and he explained the menu to me and a little bit about how Strip n Dip came to establishment.\n\nI ordered the \"kids meal\" with 2 baked chicken strips (choose between: fried, baked or grilled) and I chose the infamous mac n cheese that other Yelpers raved about as my side. You also get your choice of one dipping sauce. The buffalo sauce was yummy. Total cost was $4.79 I also ordered a 20 oz. iced thai coffee for $1.99. Two dollars for iced coffee!?! Sure...don't mind if I do. The coffee was pretty good too. They also had thai iced tea too. Hmmm...interesting...I would NEVER imagine they would have thai drinks at a chicken strip place. \n\nThis would be a perfect lunch size for all you small/light eaters. The two chicken strips were kinda on the small side but with the mac n cheese...it filled me up perfectly. (don't want to over-indulge here). I'm not a fan of mac n cheese but this.....THIS was DELICIOUS!!! The baked cheese they added on top really made this stand out from your typical boring mac n cheese. The mac n cheese alone was enough to make this review a four star rating. \n\nSo...the reason why I can't give this a full 5 stars is because of some \"rounding fee\" they do on our transaction. I wasn't even aware until a fellow Yelper told me about it. I checked my receipt and it said \"due rounding: $0.01.\" Yes, yes I know...it's only 1 cent. But still...what's up with this!?! I've NEVER, EVER seen this before in my life. Literally. \n\nBut even with this \"due rounding\" fee, would I be back?? Of course I would. Whenever I'm craving for some chicken strips..I'll swing by here. Next time, if I have a bigger appetite, I would order 4 strips and I would like to try the fries."

At some restaurants you get gamey or tough chicken strips, or worst of all tendons, or enough crust to seem like some kind of 2 year old savory donut. Not at all the case with these. Delicious and tender are all you find here. \n\nI had a 6 strip meal delivered by Uber Eats. I hadn't eaten all day so the loaded fries won me over as an upgrade. I got wasabi cream, ranch, and strip sauce as my dips. And a Thai iced coffee. \n\nThe chicken strips have won me over. Done. \n\nThe loaded fries were okay...I'm glad I got them...they were actually really tasty. I don't know where I'm going with this. They reminded me of \"carne asada fries\" but easier to consume and brighter in flavor. \n\nThe dips were mixed. The ranch is underwhelming but not bad. The strip sauce is unique - pretty much what you'd expect from the genre, creamy, tangy, and a little strange. The wasabi cream though...new favorite dip of all time. Unabashedly in love with it. \n\nLastly. The Thai iced coffee. Not my favorite. I've never had Thai iced coffee...but I'm familiar with the concept, and an unapologetic coffee nerd. I was expecting a more unique spice flavor, but it mostly tasted like oxidized coffee concentrate with a little more sugar than i would normally use to make coffee from a continental breakfast drinkable. Maybe this is just me not liking this preparation method. Maybe it's not very good. Who could say. \n\nAnyway...aside from the coffee being mediocre...the food is incredibly good, and I've already determined I'll be a return customer, and probably sooner than later. Very highly recommended based on my first experience."

The fried chicken strips are made by their special rub; the skin is not \"crunch\" , but rather a very delicious flake crust. The chicken was so tender as well. \n\nYou are also granted two sides: chose BBQ and honey mustard. I would skip the BBQ and get honey mustard and maybe their wasabi. \n\nSide Mac in cheese was also very scrumptious, and had a nice crust on top.\n\nFor less than eight dollars, this is an insane deal you cannot pass up!"

They were good but didn't make me go wow.  I had probably over hyped them for myself when I heard stories about the sizes of the strips.\n\n Not one to dwell on the negatives though, the mac and cheese was delicious as was the side of chicken nachos that were on sale that day.  The owner was friendly and made sure that service was great.  Last but not least, there's definitely a good selection of sauces, so if something is not to your liking, next time you can try a different one!  While I wasn't a fan of the Wasabi Sauce, the BFG sauce was particularly good.  I look forward to coming back and trying some of the different styles and sides at least."

Now, whenever ownership changes there is always a worry if it is for better or worse of the food and service. When a place that had a frontman bursting with personality that built a rapport with people, it's admittedly hard to not miss that. \n\nI am however pleased that the food is just as good, tastes the same. I got my favorite like always - the perfectly crisp fried strips, grilled veggie skewers or fries, honey mustard and wasabi. \n\nI like that the weekly specials like the hot chick and the nachos are just on the permanent menu instead of a weekly rotating special. No teriyaki bowl or bibimbap that I noticed being still on the menu. Sucks, teriyaki bowls here are great with the strips and I used to always order that. \n\nService is efficient. They're friendly and smiley enough, but I guess things will never be the same if people aren't as personable. I know, I know. I sound like I'm whining over something trivial... \n\nStill, if you want some good basic comfort food chicken strips, this is where I go and you should too."

That changes from now on!\n\nWe ordered two four strip dinners with chicken strips fried.  We each got French fries as our side and two ranch sauces, a wasabi, and a cheese sauce.  Within a short time, we were brought our dinners that were served in a to go box for convenience and to take with you if you don't finish.\n\nThe chicken strips were great!  The French fries were quite good.  I didn't think the garlic bread had much garlic taste but I may be too jaded by overuse of garlic.  My wife really liked the ranch sauce and the wasabi was my favorite.  For dessert, we split a chocolate funnel cake.\n\nEverything about our visit was really good.  The staff was super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although it's a really small space we enjoyed dining in.\n\nThanks to Stefany V for her great directions to the store.

I do find these on the same level as Raising Cane's.  But what BFG does better than the other chicken strip establishments in Vegas are the dipping sauces, which are pretty spectacular.  The hype on the wasabi cream sauce is completely true - it really is that good.\n\nThey also do a really good veggie skewer - and veggies usually aren't cooked this well.\n\nBut the chicken nachos, while tasty, was so rich and greasy from the cheese that I got a really horrible tummy ache the rest of the day.

It wasn't even an hour into Strip-N-Dip being open, and it was packed in there... I decided to order the food to-go because there wasn't enough seating, even after waiting and receiving the food. That wasn't a problem, though, because waiting for these chicken strips was so worth it. \n\nThe place may be hidden by the building next to it, so if you're getting directions through your phone or GPS, then just keep driving and you'll see it. The interior was black and red with checkered flooring. Everything looked clean and well-maintained. It's a bit small with limited seating, so if you come in on a busy day, chances are there will literally be no seats available. \n\nI got the 6 fried chicken strips, which comes with a small slice of garlic bread, 3 sauces, and your choice of side. I also got one baked and one grilled strip a la carte, so I can taste the differences... I am not disappointed in what I got!\n\nThe baked strip was juicy and tender. I feel like sometimes when chicken strips are being cooked, no matter the method, they run the risk of becoming dry on the inside. I think Strip-N-Dip nailed their cooking techniques because none of their strips came out dry. \n\nThe grilled strip had the distinct \"grill\" taste. It was juicy as well, and would be the best thing in between bread for a chicken strip sandwich. \n\nThe majority of the other strips I had were fried. The fried strips were perfect! The panko breading was a golden brown with a good crunch, and the chicken inside was tender... They hit the bullseye on all of their chicken strips, so I don't think anyone would be disappointed in ordering a certain type. \n\nAs for the sauces, I got: the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and their strip sauce. The wasabi cream had the subtle taste of wasabi, but with no spiciness. It's a more of a creamy sauce (like their strip sauce), so it's better paired off with the fried strips. The honey mustard, which is a classic, was sweet and paired well with every type of strip. \n\nOh! And they offer Thai iced tea/coffee and funnel cake -- perfect menu items to satisfy your \"just desserts\" appetite. \n\nStrip-N-Dip did not fail to deliver. If you're ever looking for a spot that serves chicken strips that are NOT from Cane's, then this is the spot for you!"

Slight improvement, but really only about 2.5 stars.\n\nI ordered fried strips with baked mac and cheese, honey mustard, strip sauce and ranch. \n\nFried strips: Now they use a panko breading or something similar. The strips have a nice crunch, but they lack flavor big time. A little salt and pepper would help. You definitely need sauce with these bad boys.\n\nBaked mac and cheese: The best part is the cheese on top. The noodles are overcooked and under-flavored. Pass!\n\nHoney mustard: Way too sweet and thin. It's more like a vinaigrette. It would be great in a salad, but too thin for dipping.\n\nRanch: Salty and probably store bought.\n\nStrip sauce: Good attempt at trying to imitate the Cane's sauce, but not impressed. It was palatable. \n\nGarlic toast: Sigh.. they really need to go back to the drawing board with this. It's a small slice of a baguette, soaked with butter without the slightest hint of garlic. Awful!\n\nI paid $10, which is entirely way too much for the quality. Stick with Cane's!"

I even rode my bike there one day to have lunch and I was mortified when they were closed on mondays so I ate at port a subs across the street in misery.  \n\nBe warned I am going to make a comparison to canes, I fell like it's fair because they are obviously copying them a bit, which is okay with me.   \n\nSo I give strips themselves like 3 stars maybe 2, I just love canes so much and I always compare everything to them.  When you get down to the nitty gritty the food is better at canes, I like the batter better and the sauce is awesome.  BFGs panco breading just dosen't do it for me and the chicken isn't as tender, it does however come out fresh, crispy, and not greasy.  I think at BFG they cut strips out of breasts instead of using chicken tenders and this is probably part of the culprit. The garlic toast is small but tasty, canes delicious texas toast is better still as well as their fries.  \n\nNow there is a lot of redeeming points this place has, so many I have to make a list;\n\n*Healthy versions, but the baked kind of sucked, the grilled was decent\n\n*Many many sauces, some better that others\n\n*Pretty delicious mac and cheese\n\n*Service, AMAZING, seriously when I left I felt like the owner was my BFF\n\n*Dirt cheap\n\nI struggled on whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.

They have combos where you can get 2,4, or 6 strips with a side, garlic bread and sauce. The fried strips are breaded in panko and then fried to perfection. They have some yummy sauces too- the wasabi cream is unique and delicious as well as the honey mustard. The food is nothing spectacular though, it's just okay and I have had better.\n\nMy complaint is the owner/manager named Nick. He is really friendly but he is ALWAYS multitasking. While this is not a bad thing, he does it in the middle of helping people. So you will walk up to the counter and he's like \"HEY how are ya, what can I get you?\"  And then you go \"I'll have a....\" and then he's gone off delivering food to a table.

Well gadzooks was this place off the heezy. \n\nThe service here was as impressive as the food itself. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked if this was our first time in. We said yes and he immediately asked if it was from Yelp reviews (nice!). Obviously he follows whats going on in the Yelp community. He gave us some details on the many dipping sauces they have and checked on us twice throughout our meal. There are sit down restaurants that don't do this! \n\nI never knew that selecting dipping sauces for strips could be so stressful. With the combo meals you get to choose two sauces (which is more than enough). I went with BBQ & the BFG sauce, my wife with the Ranch & Wasabi sauce. They have several sauces to choose from, next time I'll definitely try something different (these were great, but variety is the spice of life).\n\nNow the chicken strips deserve a paragraph dedicated all to themselves. We made the mistake of both getting the Fried Chicken Strips. Next time we will mix it up and each get a B-F or G (not the same). For a whopping $5.75, yes, fie dollar an sevety fie cent, you get 4 chicken strips, a side, a piece of garlic bread, and a frosty coca-cola beverage. For rizzle. It's a glorious deal. When it came to sides there was no other option as they offered homemade baked Mac N' Cheese. Schweeet! Topped with mozzarella cheese it was ooeeey and gooey, two things M&C should always be. Back to the strips though. Their not your atypical fried chicken strips. They use panko bread crumbs which is a HUGE bonus in my book. They weren't drenched in grease. In fact after eating them I didn't feel that heavy sadness that normal chicken strips cause. The chicken was so moist and juicy it was actually dripping. The bread crumbs weren't overwhelming, but just enough to get the perfect amount of crunch in every bite. I can only imagine how awesome the Baked & Grilled strips are. A definite must next time. Key words are next time. We will be back. This place is rad! \n\nGo out of your way to try BFG Chicken Strips, I don't think you will be disappointed."

He knows everyone's name- seriously, everyone! He always remembers me and everyone else who comes here, which makes us all keep coming back!\n\nSo now, about the food.. These chicken strips are delicious. I've tried all three varieties. The baked have so much flavor, and the grilled are great too. My favorite is the fried. These are not your typical American chicken strips- battered, sodium laden, and fried. These chicken strips are panko breaded and fried to perfection- coming out steaming hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist on the inside.\n\nI like to pair my chicken strips with a side of their incredible mac and cheese. They make it extra special by melting some fresh cheese on the top of your portion- adding some texture and oozing cheese fun!\n\nTheir french fries are great too, crispy and flaky. They obviously know what they're doing, unlike in-n-out burger, whose fries are chewy and flavorless.\n\nTheir choices of dipping sauces beat the pants off any fast food restaurant, especially your average McDonalds or Chic-Fil-A. It's fun to experiment with different flavor combinations with your strips- and it'll keep you coming back.\n\nThe prices are also extremely low. You will leave here satiated for only a few bucks. The thing that impressed me was how you can add more strips to your meal for low price as well. And an extra side of mac and cheese is only a buck fifty. Score!!\n\nTry this place- it's more than a hipster teenager hang out. To me, it's the best bang for your buck in Vegas. If you're looking for some good food cheap, BFG is your place."

However, I'm revising it and taking away 1 star simply due to Matt (the owner) and his over-the-top, near-creepy, downright-obnoxious attempts at \"friendliness\". Really, this guy is just WAY too much to handle. I expect to have to deal with the transparently-fake \"used car salesman\" type when I'm shopping for a car, but it's the last thing I want to deal with when I'm trying to eat dinner. I genuinely appreciate quality, friendly service (as I also said in my earlier review), but this guy's shameless, ridiculous, contrived, almost insulting \"enthusiasm\" is bordering on unbearable. In short, while I love their food, Matt's irritating shtick is in danger of keeping me and my wife away from this place. Reel it in, man. You're literally chasing customers away."

The wasabi cream was better, in my opinion.  The bibimbap was really good, too but I think my next visits will be strictly for the chicken strips!

I always get the fried strips which have a light and crispy breading that can't be beat. The chicken is juicy and fresh. The Mac And Cheese is the best I've had- Soooo cheesy and always warm. The garlic bread is a lovely addition and the BFG sauce is sooooo yummy and perfect with the fried strips. Prices for combos are really reasonable and always include a drink. The service has never been anything less than stellar- they are always sweet to my son and have a frequent visitors card. \nAll in all, I LOVE this place and will continue to make the trip to the neighborhood to indulge. It's converted me, and I used to be a die hard Canes fan.TRY IT!"

As per my check-in comment \"my fat-ass saw a picture of the NACHO FRIES\" and made a detour on the way home.  \n\nThere is only one location at the moment, and it happens to be on the other side of town for me.  However, I happened to be in the northwest yesterday and what a co-wink-a-dink they are too...so on to the review\n\nVery small menu, you have the option of chicken, um chicken and oh yea chicken.  Also, baked mac&cheese, grilled vegs and funnel cake.  Chicken comes grilled or friend and like 10 different dipping sauce options, I;m not sure if those ore homemade or not.  Small interior space yet very very clean, friendly staff, and received a coupon for my next visit.\n\nMy item of choice: NACHO FRIES, hmm...where do I start???\n\nI mean you get a lot of food for a reasonable price, the amount of fries and topping that was in the tray would had easily cost me $10+ at the competitors (which happens to be in the same business lot as Strip n Dip, ends with the letter \"O\") but that neither here nor there\n\nFor my personal liking the cut of the french fry was too thick, the plate is layered as: \nFRIES on the bottom\nREFRIED BEANS on top of the fries\nCHOPPED CHICKEN on top of the beans\nONIONS and TOMATOES on top of the chicken\nSOUR CREAM and NACHO CHEESE on top of the onions and tomatoes\ntopped off with GREEN ONIONS\n\ndon't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it was just bland, it reminded me of a Nacho Bell Grande and its been over 5+ years since I've eaten one of those.  As I was waiting for my food, I said to myself \"should I get get some dipping sauce\" then thought otherwise...I should've got some dipping sauce, because I surely did make up a quick dipping sauce to drizzled atop of my nacho fries and topped it with some JALAPENOS.  It was missing that kickback of SPICY-NESS, you hear nachos you think of HEAT of some sort.  It was not there for me, but a great meal for my 5yr old.\n\nI'll go back (I have a coupon) to try the mac&cheese and the funnel cake, if I find myself on that side of town again. But this is only my opinion, go check it out for yourself and see what you think..."

It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.\n\nBefore I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.\n\nSince this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.\n\nThe restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.\n\nAfter a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.\n\nWhile I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.\n\nOverall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!\n\nWill I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!"

They had a pretty normal menu so I stuck with what I know is good and that is fried chicken with bread. But if you are to buy anything you have to buy the macaroni since that turns the restaurant from a 3 star to a 5 star. Its not a fancy restaurant  and it has foam cups but it is a fast food restaurant .its right next to a comic store. Just to tell you when I was walking I looked inside the comic store next door and grown men where playing dungeons and dragons with there costumes on and I  can't believe that they were grown men. But anyways you should  try this restaurant if you want to try something new."

My mathematical logarithms are not so good contrary to stereotypical beliefs but I know that BFG sauces (insert greater than sign) Cane's.  \n\nThe side\n- At Cane's you can only get crinkled fries, a little cup of cole slaw, the delicious toast and... thats it. BFG offers you baked mac and cheese, vegetable skewers, garlic bread from a baguette and shoe string fries. If it wasn't for Cane's having that beautiful master piece of toast then they would have been completely dominated instead of mostly dominated by BFG. \n\nEL POLLO (CHICKEN)\n- Cane's crispy chicken reminds me of what any other place that offers fried chicken strips would be like, but BFG's fried chicken is more.. homey, its a mostly unified and equally crispy deep fry of moist addicting chicken. BFG other offerings are grilled and baked, my favorite, which is seasoned and juicy. Sorry Cane's but you gave me no choice (literally) thus checkmate by BFG. \n\nOh there is also a grilled chicken salad which I have yet to try since I am not too fond of salads.\n\nIt is a bit difficult to find it you aren't familiar with the area, which is somewhat fine for me since its my secret mistress anyways. I also would like to see some more tables, seems to have a lot of free space in the little shop."

We ordered teriyaki, buffalo, honey mustard, and BFG sauce. My favorite was the honey mustard and BFG for the fried chicken and teriyaki for the grilled.\nThe fried chicken is breaded and fried like fish and chips, it was really good, the mac n cheese seemed like Krafts with cheese on top and baked.. It was really good that way. Fries were awesome, found myself dipping them in the BFG sauce a lot! The garlic bread is not Texas toast so just expect French roll style garlic bread. I love Cane's chicken too what makes this stand out is the choices. I think I'll try the nachos next go around."

Wasabi cream is what sauce dreams are made of!)\n\nAs far as chicken fingers goes, this place is the place to be. I'm not often finding myself craving chicken fingers, but it's a simple and no-fuss type of meal.\n\nWe went with the 6 piece fried chicken finger combo with garlic bread, and added a side of fries, baked mac and cheese, and extra, extra sauce. The chicken fingers were simple, nicely seasoned, super crispy, and surprisingly moist inside. You can also opt for baked or grilled chicken and add vegetables for a lighter fare.\n\nThe side of fries was a heaping size. They topped off an entire to-go container. They were standard shoe string fries, crispy and simple. I loved dipping my fries in their sauces. Also, the baked mac and cheese was bubbling hot, comforting, and very cheesy. We enjoyed every cheesy bite. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place is definitely their sauces! They have a great variety of unique sauces. We tried the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and sweet chili. The wasabi cream and honey mustard were both delicious, but the wasabi cream is what dreams are made of! It had a sophisticated flavor, like it was from a classy upscale dining establishment. I dunked all of my fries and chicken into that sauce, it was incredible. On the other hand, I didn't care for the sweet chili too much. It tasted artificial and bottled to me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. \n\nFast, easy, and cheap comfort food, plus friendly service! A good reason to stop in again to try their other sauces!"

            "review": "Well, where can I begin about the rise and downfall of BFG? First owned by two nice guys by the names of Jin and Tin. Their goal was to make a place dedicated to chicken and pleasing the customer. Jin the front man of the whole operation was a genuinely nice person who was always trying to keep the customer satisfied and happy. He was always willing to listen and give his opinion but  in a way that wasn't offensive.The man even went as far to remember everyone's name that came through those doors But that was only half of it, their food was amazing, the line would lead to the door . My favorite things to order were the fried strips with macaroni and cheese, wasabi sauce and bfg sauce.  This went on for about 2 years. By then Tin had gotten a career he wanted and Jin had decided that it was time to pursue what he wanted in life so they sold the restaurant.\n I had been a month since they sold it when I decided to come in one day with a friend. As soon as we walked in I was greeted by one of the new owners named Jessie I believe.  He asked us for our name and if we had ever been there before stuff like that. While ordering he seemed to push us into getting the large cup for our drinks but in a way that sounded like some terrible salesman. For an owner this kid seemed as if it was his first day of working he was just so awkward. As we were waiting to get our food we see Matt another one of the owners go over to check up on customers and we see him approach a table of highschool aged girls to which he very awkwardly started to hit on them and make everyone very uncomfortable. After this very unprofessional stunt he comes over to us  and tries talking to us asking us our names stuff like that. We answered him but he still kind of stuck around he might as well as had his nose in our butts and licking our shoes he came off a little desperate or as a total kissass. By now we had been waiting a good 15 minutes for our food which is a little late for their usual delivery. We later found out that Matt was the second cook so when he came out to talk to everyone he left the other cook there by himself to take care of everything. We get our food , eat, and leave. After being dragged into going again about a month ago by some friends we walk in to see that the whole restaurant is no longer the comfortable quaint place it used to be. New tacky marble tables, they had stuck in a giant beverage fridge that seems really out of place and awkward, they had replaced the old menus with tv screens(2 of which were turned  off so you couldnt see the whole menu), and on the counter they had a very out of place beverage thing? Its like they really stick it in your face about trying to by their beverages. The new owners must be trust fund babies or something to be able to throw away this much money. Matt who is now at the counter greets us and takes our orders. Jessie is now no where to be seen( I guess blue collar work was too much for him!). We receive our food and the first thing I notice is that the fried chicken is no longer that crispy. Afterwards I noticed that their macaroni had become very soupy like they dont let it dry anymore and that the wasabi cream no longer had a kick to it. All in all I am very saddened to see how terribly the new owners have crashed this restaurant."

It's in a shopping plaza tucked into a little corner, we almost missed it!\n\nIt's small inside, maybe six tables or so. The customer service was great, aside from in-n-out I've never encountered such friendly and enthusiastic food service workers. You have a choice of 4 or 6 strips and sides. They also had a lot of sauces you can choose from, since I like anything spicy I went with wasabi cream and buffalo. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese. \n\nThey take the food out to you which I thought was nice. Everything came out extremely hot and fresh so I had to wait a minute to enjoy it but that's how you know it's going to be amazing. The chicken was better than raising canes, in my opinion. I think it's tempura fried? Either way, very crispy and light. I loved the buffalo sauce (it was actually spicy instead of all vinegar) and the wasabi cream definitely had some heat that burned my nostrils. The Mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, I was in heaven. I would put the Mac and cheese on top of my garlic bread (carbs on carbs, delicious). \n\nIf you want fast, friendly, efficient service and fresh, delicious food, stop on in. I've been converted, raising canes won't scratch my chicken itch anymore."

Even the buns for the hot chicks are amazing, nice and crusty bread rolls that are nicely toasted. This place is perfect. Simple menu, done well and with outstanding service. The only thing I would add would be katsu sauce - it would be so perfect on their chicken!"

Driving home in the car, the aroma got the better of me and I had to sample a strip. Very good was my first impression.  The coating is not the same as the other place but the quality and taste were just as good. When I got home and the family sampled the strips they decided they reminded them of katsu chicken. The coating is light and crunchy. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. I will definitely be back to try the grilled chicken and grilled vegetables."

The menu is kept simple and sticks to what they do best.  There are several combos to choose from, but I think many will customize their own meal: choose your chicken, your side and two sauces.  Easy peasy mac'n'cheesy!\n\nI'm a big fan of the grilled chicken.  The baked is easily some of the best baked chicken I've had and the fried is the most unique fried chicken I've had (thanks to the panko flakes used for breading).  But the grilled chicken gets you the grill flavor without drying up the poultry.  Go for the wasabi sauce to give your chicken some kick.\n\nWith your chicken you're given a choice of side, and you also get a slice of bread.  The mac'n'cheese is awfully cheesy in the best way possible, making it one of those foods you enjoy eating because you know you shouldn't be eating too much of it.\n\nService here is great, with Jin checking on all of his customers during their stay.  He's a really personable guy, seemingly remembering every customers name once they step through the door.  (He remembered my name after one visit!)  The one thing that bummed me out in the past was that my BFG cravings always came on a Sunday, the one day they're closed!  Fortunately, Jin has sensed this disturbance in the force and will be fixing that in the near future..."

I always feel the need to compare anytime I eat at multiple places that offer the same types of food.  Prior to coming into BFG, I frequented Raising Cane's quite a bit.  At the time, I believed Cane's to have the best chicken fingers around.  In my opinion, they still do.  However, BFG has more variety and variety is the spice of life.  Here's what I mean:\n\nBFG offers a wide array of sauces, six to be exact.  I don't remember the names of all of the sauces that are offered, but I know that I was pleased with the Wasabi Cream and the Sweet Chili.  Cane's offers one type of sauce and not much else.  I ordered the Number 2, which included four fried strips, fries (crispy and delicious) and a side of garlic bread, all for around $6.00.  I was also able to sample a baked strip, which was good and a side of their mac and cheese which was creamy and very filling all on its own.   The Chicken Nachos were also good (my friend ordered these, I swear I'm not a total fat-ass).  \n\nI am most impressed with their options.  They also offer baked or grilled strips and replace french fries for vegetables, a very good choice for those on a diet."

That's awesome, and is also the perfect size for me.  Of course they have larger, too!\n\nThe BFG sauce is what I tried and I definitely liked it a lot with their tender, well-coated fried chicken fingers.  Downright delicious.\n\nFor my side, I chose the baked macaroni and cheese... it is so creamy and southern that it filled a hole I didn't even know I had from leaving Texas.\n\nWhile the food is great, the customer service is on the same par.  Interactive, friendly, helpful but not to the point of invading your space.  They make it a point to remember your name and go above and  beyond.  Being in fanatical customer service myself, this gets crazy points in my book!\n\nFor a future work lunch, I will probably try and convince them to cater from this place.  Yum!"

They do seem a little juvenile, but damn a good fried piece of white chicken breast is just stellar for me. The strips might be considered small in size, but definitely made up for in numbers. The breading is very light but crispy nonetheless. Not very greasy in combination with the thin breading really highlighted the juice of the chicken. I got to try three different sauces. The baked mac was fab too!\n\nI would put this in my list for spots to hit up in vegas when I have the time and the soberity. Yeah it is 15 min from the strip, but who cares!

All three chicken styles are great my personal choice is baked, with wasabi cream dipping sauce and sweet chili sauce.  The staff is wonderful, Jin who is always there at the counter is always friendly.  This is great comfort food with a reasonable price, and a kind staff. Eat here, or else."

I had the ranch and the honey mustard but my friend ordered the wasabi cream. Man, was the wasabi cream the bomb-diggity.\n\nI ordered the standard fried chicken strips with Mac-and-cheese and a small piece of garlic toast. I'm usually not big on mac-and-cheese but theirs was so so tasty. I know it's bad for you but it was oooh sooo good for the soul. The owner is very friendly and walks around and takes the time to make sure that everything meets with your approval and also satisfies the taste buds. They have different specials of the week and this week it happened to be the chicken nachos. Wish I could have sampled that but I will definitely do that on my next business trip to Las Vegas. \n\nAll-in-all, you will not be disappointed when you come here. Great food, great value, and great service. Where can you go wrong?"

Fries...well I'm sure they were great right out of the fryer, I made the mistake of going to the comic book store next door to it and spending a little too much time there.  I never like cold fries but I can't honestly say how they were fresh, Sweet Chili sauce and ranch were my choices, the sweet chili sauce was very good, ranch was great as well.  Kids enjoyed their food and the wife was pleased as well.  Jin was great, he is running a great operation there."

The chicken is not fatty and the coating on the outside of the fried strips was crispy.  I wasn't impressed with the grilled veggies, but this really isn't a health food kind of place.  My lemonade tasted like cleaner, so I would go with the soda next time.  I would go back, although I'm not crazy about the neighborhood.  Lots of strange people walking around at night."

There are a total of like 6 combos that you can order, or you can order a la carte or a special.  The husband ordered the #1- four baked chicken strips, baked mac & cheese, two sauces (ranch & BBQ), garlic bread and a coke.  I had the special- Chicken Nachos.\n\nI am on the once a week Taco Bell Nacho Bell Grande kick for the past month. (don't ask me why!  they just taste so good!) and these chicken nachos kicked its ass.  Chips, cheese, chicken, pico, sour cream, beans, scallions... delicious!\n\nThe husband liked his combo #1 and I also liked his mac & cheese.  Thank god he didn't eat it all and I get to have lunch off of it tomorrow! :)\n\nI think it was the owner, Jin, who was very attentive and walked around to the tables to make sure that everyone was taken care of.  When we walked in, he asked \"this is your first time, right?\".  WOW!  He definitely knows his customers.\n\nWe will definitely be heading back to try more!"

            "review": "*Best Chicken Strips in Las Vegas*\n\nReally enjoyed this place, easily some of the best chicken strips I've ever had. They have a simple menu but it is by no means limiting with the various options you can mix and match your meal with. BFG lets you know everything you need to know about the chicken choices Baked, Fried, or Grilled. Once you chose the chicken you have the tough decision of which of the 9 dipping flavors to choose from; Wasabi Cream, BBQ, Ranch, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, Cheese, and BFG (their house dipping sauce). And finally accompanying each meal is a piece of toast and your final decision between a side of Mac n cheese, grilled vegetables, or fries.\n\nNow let me start off by saying that all the different types of chicken are delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the baked chicken but let me tell you, they know how to do it right. Whenever I picture baked chicken, it seems bland but at BFG they spice it just right to give it a kick in flavor. The grilled chicken has a bit of sauce giving it a unique flavor setting it aside from the baked. And finally the fried chicken is amazing! These aren't your run of the mill chicken strips you get at a bar. You'll notice the difference immediately due to their use Panko instead of regular batter which I love because it gives the chicken a nice crispy texture with just the right amount of breading. \n\nNow the sauces are really up to personal preference. and the majority are pretty run of the mill so I'll just get into their \"unique\" sauces. The BFG house sauce has a very light undertone flavor resembling thousand island and other flavors that will need more tastings to get down. The sweet chili sauce is an asian style sauce with the spices in it working very well with the sweet flavor of it. I was very surprised by how well the sweet chili worked with the chicken. When I first saw and smelled the Sweet chili sauce it seemed like it did not belong next to chicken strips, but when you take your first bite of a chicken strip covered in this sauce it will all make sense. It's a delicious flavor explosion in your mouth with the sweet chili enhancing the flavor of the chicken. Easily on of my favorites. Now the wasabi cream is pretty straight forward, it tastes like wasabi. But it is not nearly as overwhelming as actual wasabi and it has none of the burn. It is another surprising flavor that I have not seen anywhere else and that taste delicious.\n\nI haven't gotten a chance to try the grilled vegetables but to me the mac n cheese and fries were not really anything special. And the toast tastes like toast. Also every week they have a new special which I have yet to try any of so when I get a chance I'll update my review.\n\nOverall good service, good food, and decently priced. There really isn't much else to say other than if you haven't tried BFG yet, try it!"

I was impressed! \n\n2) the sauces were also delicious. I got the buffalo, wasabi, and strip sauce. Strip sauce was pretty good but the other 2 were unbelievably good. \n\n3) the fries were really good too. Nicely fried, as you would expect with such perfectly fried tenders!\n\n4) they have the new coke machine where you can make any drink you want! The large cup for the soda was also the nicest cup I've gotten in a fast food place. I'll be keeping it and using it at home. \n\nNow for the reasons it's not a five, and was even close to being knocked to a 3:\n\n1) the place stunk like shit. No exaggeration. My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking forward to a casual sit down dinner, but we couldn't stand the smell for more than a minute or so. I asked the staff, and they said the place next door doesn't do their sewage sometimes so then the smell makes its way over to strip n dip. I get its out of their hands, but omg it was disgusting \n\n2) the Mac and cheese was weak, like real weak. You know when you get excited about mac and cheese, and then it's tasteless? That's what this is. Tasteless. Very disappointed. \n\n3) Value. Well, I'll maybe say I was neutral on this. I spent 20 bucks, one drink, a 6 piece meal and a 4 piece meal. Too much? Yes. However it was a bunch of food and we were stuffed. \n\nI'll be back for the chicken fingers for sure, just hope the place doesn't force us to take out because of the smell"

I opted for the fried chicken vs the grilled or baked.  And I chose the grilled vegies, which a nice healthier side order option.  The fried chicken fingers were panko breaded so it was very crunchy, but not oily.  I picked the BFG and wasabi sauce.  The BFG sauce is best described as a sour thousand island dressing.

The wasabi was a good choice for the chicken, while the BFG was better on the vegies.\n\nMy only gripe with this place is they do not allow you to mix and match chicken styles."

For those of you who aren't hip enough to know what BFG stands for, it means Baked, Fried or Grilled. You have the choice of choosing either of those three options. Upon walking in, I noticed that this placed had to be good because it was packed the whole time I was there. I ordered the 6 finger meal, which comes garlic bread, your choice of side (macaroni and cheese, fries or grilled veggies) and your choice of three sauces, too many to name right now. I got fried chicken tenders, mac n cheese and my sauces were ranch, BFG and the yasabi sauce.\n\nThe wait for the meal was not long at all, before I even expected it I was already greeted with a tray of my delicious foods. It's kind of hard to ruin chicken tenders, but there was something about these tenders that blew me away. They were delicious and cooked to perfection. The panko breading was a perfect compliment to the succulent chicken that was surprisingly juicy. Although I got fried, I will go back and try those baked tenders because I looked at a strangers plate and they looked freaking delicious. I got 6 tenders and I could only eat 4 of them, they are sized just right and not too small or too large.\n\nI was super excited to try the macaroni and cheese and that was, admittedly, the first thing that I ended up trying. The M&C was baked in this generous tin and my gosh. Something so simple tasted so great. It had this layer of cheese baked right on top and I didn't want it to end, but my stomach did and I got super full really quick. But it was amazing.\n\nThe sauces were great, ranch was ranch. The BFG sauce tasted something like Thousand Island but I LOVED the Yasabi sauce. It wasn't spicy or anything, but it just tasted great. I loved it and kind of gave it all my love with my tenders. \n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone and I'm glad I was able to visit one of my Yelp bookmarks after numerous failed attempts to go. If you go, let me know cause I am down!"

No not the type you drink, but Jin, one of their young proprietors who can be seen greeting every guest by name (and remembering it) before during and after your meal. You can tell he truly cares about his customers and wants them to come back with a smile and an empty stomach. One of the nicest persons I can remember meeting in many many years.\n\nNow on to the food. Baked fried or grilled. Your call. A nice way of choosing how heathly you want your strips with a bunch of exotic and traditional dipping sauces to choose from which really mix it up unlike normal chicken strip places. Also they have a chicken strip salad which looked great if your watching your figure. \n\nNow I have 3 words for you. Panko. Bread. Crumbs. Thats right, get the fried chicken strips that come lightly breaded in panko bread crumbs and you may not want to get your chicken strips fix anywhere else. They taste so light and tasty yet not greasy if you know what I mean. \n\nNext to it is the piping hot baked mac n cheese oozing over the foil bowl it comes in which was spot on good, sided with a small slice of their tasty garlic bread and a drink of your choice and you feel like you just went a level above fast food into a level of pure comfort food for a whole wopping $6. That's right. Who said food prices have gone up? Not for Jin and company. \n\nAlso they give little BFG chicken stickers to the kids and give out a repeat customer loyalty card as well. BFG and Jin are a win in my book. \n\nGood luck guys, see you on my next trip in.\nJason from Vegas... living in Jersey."

There is plenty of parking!\n\nAlright so upon walking in I'm very happy to see the small but yummy looking menu! Consisting of chicken strips either baked, fried, or grilled, fries, Mac n cheese, grilled veggie, garlic bread, Thai iced coffee, and sodas.(I may have missed some stuff BUT that's the gest of it)   The guy taking my order was very friendly and greeted me right away! I ordered 2 4pc meals one grilled, one fried, side of fries,  side of mac n cheese and subbed a soda for Thai ice coffee. He gave me my soda cup right away and we sat to wait for our order and he brought my iced coffee with a cup holder over to me!! Awesome service I must say!! \nThe iced coffee is strong and not too sweet, I got it for hubby mostly buuuut I might just drink it lol they have coke products and a tea dispenser too. I love powerade! So we take our food home and start munching! A lot of people suggest this place is like raising canes but besides the fact that BFG serves fries, chicken, and garlic bread, all 3 of which are very different from raising canes! I love both places!! The fried chicken strips were fried using panko bread crumbs and were still crazy crunchy when I got home! The grilled strips were flavorful and cooked perfectly. I didn't care for the fries...I think they could one up raising canes even more by cooking fresh cut fries, probably more cost effective too!! The Mac n cheese was the bomb, as other reviewers have said!! I regret not getting atleast one more side cause my 3yo was OBSESSED and eating it all lol damn bein a mom and having to feed the kids ;p  okay now to the sauces! We tried honey mustard, really good, buffalo, nothing unusual, wasabi cream, can I have a bucket please?!?!? And the ranch which I am a ranch lover especially when you get it with your wings from restaurants but this ranch didn't taste like that so I will not be ordering it again :( \nAll in all I think I've found a brand new favorite place to eat!!! Thank you BFG can't wait till next time...maybe tomorrow????  Oh and one other thing it would be awesome if BFG were open a lil later! They close at 8 which is different for Vegas lol"

The service is incredible and when I had to move back across the country I felt bad that I would no longer be able to give Jin my money anymore for his delicious chicken strips.\n\nThe chicken strips are great whether you get them Baked, Fried or Grilled.  I was always partial to the Fried due to the breading being so crisp.  The Mac and Cheese is wonderfully cheesy and stays hot and gooey for a very, very long time.  They offer a wide variety of dipping sauces and you really can't go wrong with them.  Pick as your mood/taste dictates.\n\nThe weekly rotating specials are also all very good choices to get.  I am partial to the nachos but the Bi Bam Bap is also fantastic.\n\nThere's a reason why BFG has consistently ranked in the top few spots for food in Vegas.  What it does it does extremely well for the food and Jin goes to great lengths that are no longer common at all to make you feel welcome and valued as a customer.  Its really strange to see how customer service has more or less died but it makes it easy for a well-run place like BFG to endear itself to so many Vegas dwellers.  I look forward to the next time I am in Vegas so I can get some fried strips, mac and cheese and hopefully, it'll be chicken nachos week.\n\nBefore we moved I was unable to eat here one last time due to surgery and had to watch my wife enjoy one more Bi Bam Bap from there while I drank an Ensure.  A tough thing to endure.  Actually, as I submit this review I see its chicken nachos week and it pains me to know I can't get any, well, barring a 2100 mile flight/drive..."

The mac'n'cheese is so delicious, with real cheese piled on! Even the fries have a great flavor!

Their sauce selections are a perfect accompaniment, with classics like ranch and buffalo backed up by swinging originals like wasabi cream, sweet chili, and even cheese!

It's hard to ignore funnel cakes! \n\nThis place is located in a very large strip mall & walking in I have to say I was not impressed. It was run down. The decor itself is nothing special but I let that slide when things are tidy. They weren't. It was also dirty. Trash on the floors, everything seemed out of place & the kitchen area which is open shouldn't be because there was shit everywhere. For a moment I thought to myself, this can't be it. \n\nWe ordered the fried strips that come in panko which were great. Fries were ok. Garlic toast was really good & my man loved the hot chick. We also had the baked strips with mac & cheese, both good. Overall the food was good. They gave a wide variety of side sauces & I loved trying most of them. My favorites were the honey mustard & sweet chili. The Thai tea was my least favorite item of the evening as it was bitter & needed more sugar (super disappointing). Now to the funnel cake. AMAZING! It was perfect & couldn't get any better. By far the highlight! \n\nI appreciated the pop art (always a good thing to see) but the place really needs a facelift. It also really needs to be cleaned. I didn't take pics of all the issues but someone needs to rescue this place. The food is good & it would taste even better if the atmosphere was improved. Food gets 4 stars but atmosphere & cleanliness get 2 so I settled on an overall rating of 3."

Our food was brought out, we were checked on throughout our visit, and given a goodbye as we walked out the door- all with a smile by the gentleman behind the counter.\n\nAs for the food: BF got a 6 piece fried with a side of mac, I opted for the 4 piece rotisserie with a side of veggies, and we added on a hot chick and a thai tea- the latter mostly because since when have I ever been able to get chicken strips and thai tea in the same place? Bizarre but lovely. The drink was out right away and just a smidge less sweet than I am used to. $2 cup is well-priced.\n\nThe chicken arrived hot and tasty: BF surprisingly preferred the grilled while I preferred the panko breading for the fried version. We tried several different sauces including the ranch (nothing interesting), wasabi (nice with just a little kick), honeymustard (light but not my thing), strip sauce (my favorite), and buffalo (my second favorite, dude's preferred dip). BF put it well: he'd come back for the grilled strips tossed in buffalo sauce, but the rest of the menu seemed too similar to Raisin' Cane's for his liking, and he's a huge fan of theirs.\n\nAs for the sides: the mac was super indulgent and better than the mac I've had at more formal or high-end places. Loved that the dish was still gooey and cheesy instead of dried out, which I run into a lot at places that call themselves \"southern\" or boast about being \"homestyle\". Dude, if I made this mac at home, I'd never leave... because I'd weigh 500 pounds. It's good, but definitely only get if you went to the gym that day, there's a lot of guilt involved with that much pasta and cheese.\nThe grilled veggies were a surprise hit with BF, he'd tack those on to his future grilled-with-buffalo purchase.\n\nLastly, the hot chick was oddly again one of my favorite things: a simple fried strip doused in buffalo sauce (sensing a theme?) and placed in a small bun with lettuce and tomato, it's simple and it's delicious. There's  meal option for two of those with a side, and I'd likely consider it in the future.\n\nFinal note about their loyalty program: tracks your purchase spendings by the dollar, when you reach a $60 total you get a free meal. I didn't ask for more details but I do like that it tracks with your phone number rather than yet another pesky key tag or card to keep track of."

Not sure why some of the low ratings. People need to understand costs are going up everywhere, hence, why business owners need to increase prices. \"If you no like, go to KFC!\" Simple as that.\n\nLet's start with customer service: This lil family owned hole in the wall that is easily missed if you are not paying attention is on a fine mission to smother you with niceness! One of the workers held the door open for us as we walked in :-0 ...Oh-and as I walked in, I overheard her tell another customer if their experience eating there was not up to their expectations, she would \"take care of them\" at their next visit! That's a strong statement, Strip N Dip, we will hold you to your word! The cashier was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining their menu items and filling us in on what the popular picks were. The wait was not long and our food was delivered promptly. \n\nEstablishment: Took off a star because we did not have the option to eat at the restaurant due to overcrowding. Seating is very limited so we took our food to go. Maybe if the place was a little bigger, people would not be forced to take their food to go and have to experience a case of \"cold food.\" No bueno.\n\nFood: The deep fried chicken strips were amaze-balls! Very tender and flavorful. The Mac & Cheese.......OMG, the Mac & Cheese......SO F'ing GOOD!!!!!!! (for a lack of better words.) Do not come here and NOT order the Mac & Cheese because you will miss out on the full experience. Also, a hot pick here is the nachos. Holy bejezus! These are addicting! \n\nHonestly, for a first timer, I would recommend the nachos, Mac & Cheese and if room available, have the fried chicken strips. :-)"

As some others have said...I don't think that panko breading is the best option for chicken.  It is more appropriate for seafood.  It does not have enough flavor for my taste.  The chicken itself was fresh and of high quality.  If I were to return (I won't) I would try the grilled or baked chicken.  They do offer some flavorful sides to dip the chicken in.\n\nI had the Mac & Cheese as a side.  The Mac and Cheese was not great.  The macaroni was way over cooked and the sauce itself tasted like Kraft Mac & Cheese.  It was very orange and tasted like it was derived from a powder.  I did not taste any breadcrumbs on top (that is what the menu stated).  There was however a nice amount of real cheese melted on top of the side.\n\nI would skip this place unless you are a fan of panko and like very little flavor."

Which is kind of a bummer seeing how there was a group of HS kids that took up half of the whole restaurant. \n\nThe prices are very affordable. But the food I thought was lacking. Mind you I haven't tried the entire menu but over all I found it lacking. The fried strips are tempura style. They are light and crisp but in the end I have had many more flavorful tempura encounters. I will say that I enjoyed the grilled fingers but they weren't anything to write home about. With your fingers you get to choose 2 sauces. Based on other reviews I chose the wasabi cream and sweet chili. The wasabi cream had the taste of wasabi but no kick. The kick being the only reason I like wasabi made this sauce very disappointing. The sweet chili sauce was very flavorful and tasted great with the grilled strips and fries. Last but not least was the Mac and Cheese which was incredibly bland. As soon as I tasted it I knew what was missing; onion. But I guess I shouldn't expect such things from a restaurant such as this.  \n\nThe highlight of this establishment is the owner; Jin. He is very friendly and talks to all his customers and even remembers your name from previous visits. But after being here twice I don't think I will revisit. \n\nThe bottom line is: They serve affordable food aimed towards teenagers and broke college students. Great service but mediocre food.

            "review": "I first visited this restaurant back in 2011 (as BFG) when Yelpers all over Vegas were fawning over it.   Not only was the food raved about but everyone seemed amazed at how well the owner at the time could remember names to faces and naturally I wanted to test it out.   True story: the 2nd time I went back he had no idea who I was.   Nice parlor trick!   The fact that it's extremely close to my work didn't hurt either.   As of a few weeks ago I visited it again for the 4th time (the 2nd time under the new monikor).   I feel like that fact pretty much exemplifies how I feel about about it.   If I hated it, I probably would have never returned.   If I loved it, I'd probably have been 15-20 times at least.   Yelp math!   In those 4 visits I have tried all 3 variations of their signature chicken strips, and the grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and fries for sides.   \n\nGrilled:  This is what I was most excited about.   Every so and so months I decide that I need to stop gorging myself on red meat and carbs as I usually do, so reading about tasty grilled chicken strips accompanied by grilled veggies made my deep deep inner skinny person rejoice.   Unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed both times I tried them.   The chicken and the veggies both just tasted very bland to me.   Maybe every delicious fried chicken finger I've had from Raising Cane's and other establishments has tainted my taste buds.\n\nBaked:  Tried this for the first time a few weeks back.   Better than the grilled for sure due to the seasoning, but not anything that has me craving a return visit.  With this order I had the fries, which I did enjoy quite a bit.   But I mean, they're FRIES.   Hot, crispy and well seasoned though.   \n\nFried:  The best of the three, but to reiterate the point: it's fried chicken, of course it's good.  The panko breading definitely make it unique to most other versions you can find elsewhere, but not necessarily better tastewise.   And to make an unhealthy choice worse I got the mac and cheese with it the one time I tried it.   A good version for sure, but it didn't exactly set itself apart from most other mac and cheeses that I've had.\n\nThe stars of the show here are the dipping sauces.   The wide variety of them provide for a lot of different tasting experiences and most of the ones I tried were extremely tasty.   My favorites are the sweet chili and wasabi cream, and in particular I liked combining those two for a sweet/spicy combo.   You can be like Bill Nye the Science Guy and experiment on your own combinations.  Bring the kids, they'll have a blast.\n\nSo overall it's good food, and the price isn't too bad, but it doesn't exactly light my world on fire either.   See you in 8 months or so Strip N Dip!"

We had seen the high ratings on Yelp prior to our visit so the wife and I had to make a stop and I'm glad to report that we can't help but concur with all the positive praise for this place.\n\nChicken strips...what more can I say.  You can get them Baked, Fried, or Grilled.  We both decided to build our own combos and seeing as how we were on vacation and not worried about being healthy, we opted for the fried strips with baked mac & cheese and garlic bread.\n\nThe strips were crispy but not heavy like something you'd get from Popeye's or KFC.  The breading is definitely more panko crisp than buttermilk batter crunchy.  Delicious and moist.\n\nThe baked mac & cheese was awesome as well.  Very hot when it shows up at your table but once you're able to dig in, cheesey explosion and tender macaroni are headed your way.  I like how the macaroni noodles themselves were tender without being mushy like KFC's.  The garlic bread was a nice finishing touch and not something you'd typically expect from a more fast food-esque establishment.\n\nYou get your choice of 2 dipping sauces and we chose BBQ, Sweet Chili, Buffalo, and Wasabi Cream.  Two words: WASABI CREAM.  Perfect.  You get a slightly spicy wasabi flavor without being over-powering and the creamy texture helps smooth it out.\n\nThe food was so good that we stuck around and added an order of fries which were perfect as well.  Golden, crispy, and lightly battered.\n\nThe service was awesome and the staff super friendly.  The guy who took our order was very nice and engaging and was making sure to check up on us as well as the other patrons which is refreshing to see in a small establishment.\n\nI'm happy to say that we will definitely be making this a regular stop.  At about $12 to feed 2 people with awesome food, how could we not?!"

Situated next to the Home Depot, there were plenty of people even at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon waiting for their plate of fried goodness.  And what a plate of battered deliciousness it is!\n\nCombo meals ($5.75 each) are easy. Choose your style of chicken (baked, fried or grilled) and your side (grilled veggies, salad, mac 'n cheese, french fries). Each meal comes with two house-made dipping sauces, a drink and garlic bread. We ordered two combo meals - 1 plate of fried chicken with a side of mac 'n cheese, 1 plate of grilled chicken on a bed of salad  and tried 4 different sauces. We also returned for a second run to try their fries and 3 other sauces (neither my hubs or I like Ranch).\n\nThe grilled chicken was wonderfully succulent, and had a nice flavour and texture - very similar to Korean barbeque. Fried chicken had a perfect consistency - tender and juicy on the inside with a lovely golden crispy panko crust on the outside without being too greasy. It had a perfect ratio of coating to meat and completely satisfied our cravings.\n\nThe other attraction is the interesting combination of sauces they offered. We tried teriyaki, BFG sauce, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream, sweet thai chili, and bbq sauces. Our favs: the honey mustard had a bit of a nice hint of heat to it( as mustard should) while the sweet thai chili offered a lovely combination of spice and sweetness. My hubby, who loves wasabi, adored the creamy concoction.\n\nThe reason for the 4 stars is probably the sides. While the salad was wonderful (the veggies were incredibly fresh) and the fries were great, the baked mac 'n cheese was only okay. The cheese sauce, perhaps little too generic tasting for us, but it's prepared well with ample amounts of cheese topping and perfectly cooked macaroni. Definitely comfort food. The garlic bread was flavourful but lack the density of a nice slice of bread.\n\nThese are really minor quibbles and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats at a fantastic price. The variety of the menu really makes this place a crowd pleaser especially with the healthier options. This place definitely gives other casual dining places (ahem! the Golden Arches) a run for its money.\n\nFinally, the staff made a point to get to know you and make sure you have a good experience. They are more than helpful with making sure you have everything you need (utensils, drinks - you name it). This place has the makings of a great neighbourhood joint and I can't wait to come back here again!"

My husband and I had the baked strips and my mom tried the grilled. Our baked strips were cooked well, not chewy, but the size of the strips wasn't too impressive. You end up with way more dip than strip in the end. The fries were alright, nothing special. The piece of garlic bread that comes with the meal is small. My husband got a significantly larger piece of bread than me in his meal but it was still a small piece of bread. The flavoring on the bread is good but nothing outstanding. The Mac and cheese was yummy (not the best I've ever had but enjoyable all the same). I like the extra cheese they put on top of it. We tried a few different dips and all were pretty tasty.

All the food is prepared fresh, made to order except the fries.  I had combo #3 which is 4 grilled chicken strips w/ grilled veggies + garlic bread + a drink.  I added 2 fried chicken strips and had Wasabi Cream + BFG as my sauces, the owner gave me a bonus to try so I tried the sweet chilli + honey mustard.  We all know chicken is chicken.  It's all in the way you prepare it and the sauces.  I really liked the wasabi cream + honey mustard.  All sauces are prepared on site.  It's something different,  worth a try.  Oh and btw, I got all the food I listed above for 7 bucks.  The prices are VERY reasonable. $5.75 for a combo.  It's a mom + pops shop, definitely worth supporting."

Maybe, you can find a job as a door stop or stand-in food on a local tv shoot, but I wouldn't plan on staying in the real food business for too long because personally I'd much rather have one of the tasty strips from BFG. \n\nOf course, the fact that I have never enjoyed foods that still have bones helps my appreciation for a fine chicken strip, but I am confident most anyone would devour these treats. First, props for a simple, creative concept: baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips with matching sides. If you want baked, you can get the combo with baked mac 'n' cheese; fried comes with french fries, and grilled comes with grilled veggie skewers. You can mix it up too if you like, which we did.\n\nWe were in the mood for just a snack, so we shared a make our own combo with fried strips, mac 'n' cheese, tasty brewed iced tea, and we added some grilled veggie skewers. Everything is made to order, and comes out hot enough to burn your mouth, so be careful! Don't cram that delicious fried strip down your throat immediately. But, eventually, you will do just that. The breading reminded me of a delicious katsu, superior to most fried chicken I have sampled.\n\nAs for the sides, mac 'n' chese lovers rejoice, as the creation here is super cheesy. The cheeses might not be fancy, but it will put you in a comfort food coma for sure. For the healthier peeps, the grilled veggies are simple and delicious, too, with zucchini and onions and tomatoes. Fresh and served piping hot like everything else! \n\nYou get two sauces, and they have a wide selection of mostly homemade options. We went with honey mustard and buffalo, and here is my one teeny complaint: the buffalo was not very spicy. I definitely think they need at least one sauce that delivers a big heat punch! I will try sweet chili next time. \n\nStill, that won't me prevent me from coming back. The owners are two young Asian blokes who are super personable and knew everyone's name. Regulars are always a good sign! The place is smallish and very casual with counter service, so don't get dressed up for your visit.\n\nCreative, friendly, and tasty. I can't really think of what else you could want from a strip. Add spicy, and BFG may become the hottest local strip club. (I couldn't resist.)"

I like to compare this place to In-N-out..... not that it is the same type of food, but it is similar in simplicity! They only have a few items on their menu (like in-n-out). It's just genius. I hate going to places that have a billion items on their menu and it takes me forever to look over everything and then the food is blah. This chicken strip place is awesome! \n\nGet your chicken strips either Baked, Fried, or Grilled! Simple as that! \nAnd the fried strips are coated in panko crumbs, which makes it taste better then regular battered fried chicken. \n\nTheir frys are as expected.....BUT the baked Mac-N-Cheese is what makes it.\nIt comes in a round tin container, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is plenty. It has this layer of cheese on top that is slightly burnt, not the gross burnt, but that slight cheese burnt. If you are a cheese lover, there is no denying this place's Mac-N-Cheese! \n\nIt is also family owned which I love to support in this town! \n\nLastly, their prices are reasonable, on the cheaper side. Its great that this place is in business. I hope they do well and open up more locations!"

That's what brought us from Henderson to Rainbow and 95. \n\nWe were greeted by a friendly person who ended up being one of the owners, Matt. I noticed right away that he really did have a passion for what he does. I think that the most successful people differ from the others because of their passion. With his help, we ordered the family meal which more than fed me, hubby, syd, cam, and luke. And might I add that we are all big eaters and all have active Yelp profiles detailing our eating escapades (except for luke, he's 3). First, the baked mac n cheese was a revelation. I can make some good stuff, but this one closely rivals my own personal recipe. It's sooo delish. The fries and the veggies were stellar. The chicken comes in 3 styles: baked with rotisserrie season, fried with panko, and grilled with asian marinade. My hubby asked which I liked the best and I couldn't even choose. \n\nThey are embarking on a catering biz, too. We have committed to Matt to use him for the whole next year of kid birthday parties. This is the perfect food for a crowd, or to drop into for a quick lunch. \n\nThey are located next to Home Depot on the garden side. I would recommend them to anyone that likes homestyle food that's hot and fresh."

Hubby got a #2 - fried chicken, fries and garlic bread and I got the #1 - grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese and garlic bread. I really liked both types of chicken so much that I can't decide which I liked better. I did really like the fact that the baked was really moist and the seasoning added some nice flavor even before the dips. I really liked the crunchy coating on the fried, like another review said it was very much like panko breadcrumbs, which was a change from a breading texture like I'm used to, but a good change. \nThe fries were good and not greasy but OMG that mac & cheese was AWESOME! The noodles were well cooked, not mushy, and the sauce was creamy and mild but that stringy crust of shredded cheese on top was heaven - I would go just for a serving of the mac & cheese.\nWe tried 5 sauces: BFG, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream and ranch. I really liked both the honey mustard (not too sweet or too tangy) and the wasabi cream (could probably use a little more wasabi but still good and different). The garlic bread was good nothing amazing but in no way bad.\nOverall I really enjoyed everything we ordered and will be adding BFG into my normal roster of take out dinners!"

My thing is this...when I review a restaurant, it is comparable to its peers, not every restaurant ever.  I do not put E by Jose Andres, and Cuginos Italian Deli in the same category, even though I enjoy them both.  Both are awesome and I give both 5 stars, but that is not to say they are the same.  My 5 stars for BFG is in the sense that among similar type restaurants, it is excellent.\n\nThe staff working the counter were excellent here.  He guy at the counter knew most of the people who came in by name and was very friendly and engaging with them.  When I got to the counter, he was very friendly and welcoming.  Definitely a good atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is simple.  3 types of strips..Bakes Fried Grilled.  A few sides and garlic bread.  Thats it.  I ordered some of each type for a total of 8 strips and got it with a side of grilled vegetables, a drink and a piece of garlic bread for a little under $10.\n\nThe grilled vegetables were simple, yet very good.  I enjoy getting 2 skewers of grilled veggies, even if they are just tomato, onions and zucchini.  A simple, healthy dish with a good flavor.  The garlic bread had pieces of real garlic on top, which was nice.  It had a good strong garlic flavor, yet did not feel super buttery or greasy like some garlic bread can be.\n\nThe strips were a mixed bag.  The baked strips were very plain.  They were not bad, but they did not taste like anything special.  They had some seasoning on them and tasted simple.  I would not get them again.  \n\nThe fried strips were very tasty.  They did not feel greasy at all, and had a very delicious panko breading on them.  They were very juicy inside and had an excellent flavor, rather than just tasting like fried garbage like a lot of chicken strips do. \n\nThe grilled strips were also very tasty.  They had a little marinade in them which gave them a nice flavor, and were very juicy as well.  No dried out strips at all, quite the opposite.\n\nDespite the fact that the baked strips were subpar, the other parts were very good in all respects and the service was very good.  They even said goodbye to me by name when I walked out.  Very customer oriented attitude here it seems, along with a simple, inexpensive menu that offers very easy and good lunch fare."

However, the total package (when you add a drink) is a little high at about $10+ if you get the 6 strip combo (which you will want if you get baked or grilled because you won't have batter 'adding mass'). \n\nThe fries seem like they are from a distributor, which is weird coming from a place that wants to elevate the chicken strip to an art form. I understand that this is likely to achieve economies of scale not possible in a one-location business. Additionally, several of the sauces (including barbecue, but I forget the others) are from a vendor as well, and not made in-house.\n\nThis is important, at least to me, because for about $7.60, you can get a 'naked strips' combo at Popeyes and get basically the same amount of product, and arguably of similar or better quality. (Popeyes is fresh, not frozen, and has invested in test kitchen R+D for the various marinade/spice mixes used on the naked strips.)\n\nIf I were getting the fried ones, I would have a hard time coming here frequently, just based on the quality and price of other options that are equally fresh and made-to-order such as Raising Cane's. But I'd still add this place to my rotation, easily."

They are the kind of fries that have that texture like they've been rolled in a batter, on the skinny side, with just enough salt to make them irresistible.\n\nThe grilled veggies (zucchini or squash, onions, roma tomatoes) are a point of contention for me. I thought they tasted great (they seem to be lightly marinated in the same sauce as the grilled chicken), but the cuts of veggies were on the small side. That is a personal preference for me, though. I would rather have a crunchy bite of zucchini in there still. \n\nTHE DIPS: Oh Em Gee!!\nBFG rounds out their high-quality chicken with amazing, freshly made (I think they are homemade?!) dips that range from regular to wacky.\n\nHoney Mustard like I used to get in the south! you can see the mustard seeds in there! I loved it with the fries and fried ckn.\n\nBFG sauce is good, it seems to be something like a soy with a thicker base, with a little sweetness and seasonings? I can't figure it out, but its really good on the grilled chicken.\n\nWasabi Cream! Nice Choice BFG. Talk about something different and very good! Its not overly strong (maybe they could offer a dollop of wasabi so you can change the strength? I like wasabi A LOT), its a wonderful change to a world of ketchup/ranch.\n\nSweet Chili is another welcome change. if you like a little heat, mixed with a little sweet, this is for you!\n\nThe only dip I didn't love is the Ranch, but that's another personal thing. I love buttermilk Hidden Valley Ranch (hey! i'm a southern girl) and no other. and this isn't that. but with the other dips, I don't mind!\n\nThey made me a taste-test of fried mac & cheese balls, if they put that on the menu, get it! it was good (panko breaded too).\n\nAll of the meals come with good garlic bread, great friendly service, and its made when you order it. So be prepared to wait about 5 minutes (worth it).\n\nI would think this would be great family stop on a weeknight or a weekend, or good take out (I'm going to try takeout sometime to see how it holds up). The place is small, like probably seats 15 people, but its definitely a place to try. Several times."

We wanted to actually stop by on Sunday, but thanks to Yelp, it told us that they were closed. I made my fianc\u00e9 meet me up at BFG's for lunch today. It was definitely worth the drive and being late for work.  I walked in and #1 combo caught my eye....the mac and cheese sold me. The fianc\u00e9 ordered the #2 combo. \n\nService was pretty awesome. One of the owners noticed that we were newbies to BFG's and took the time to explain to us what the different selections of chicken were. He also came back repeatedly to check on how we were doing. For a \"fast\" food joint, that's some pretty dang good service. \n\nFor the food, I definitely did not go wrong with the #1. The baked chicken was so tender and juicy, it makes my mouth water thinking about it. It was seasoned with a rotisserie spice and baked. Also, the fact that it's juicy white meat wins them the 5 stars. I am not a dark meat fan and for those dark meat lovers, this white chicken will have you fooled. I liked that you could choose the different sauces although I ate most of my chicken without sauce. Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy. I'm a cheese whore, so this definitely met my standards. I was able to try the fried chicken and it was tender and juicy inside. I do think I prefer the baked chicken over the fried chicken though BUT that's just MY opinion. \n\nOverall, the chicken is very delicious and anyone who hasn't tried this place is missing out. We definitely will be back for more baked and fried goodness. OH and it helps that they have a stamp card.....benefits of going repeatedly...I'll take a free meal anytime."

But The chicken strips are so good as well as the best baked Mac an cheese around. The fried strips are amazing but you can also get them grilled or baked which are also very good. The grilled veggies if you like veggies are also very good. We usually get a 6 piece meal which I never finish that comes with 6 strips 1 side garlic bread an 3 sauces of your choice. It's a great deal for 8.99. Plan on trying the chicken sandwich sometime an the nachos oh an make sure you save room for Funnel cake yes they have funnel cake.

Maybe because so many places make nasty mac and cheese here, we're all excited to see a place that doesn't mess it up? It's good but not life changing, world shattering, slap yo momma, marriage material mac and cheese. Again the owner was so sweet and checked on every table. He knew regulars by name and could spot a first timer from a mile away. Extra star for service!

Cane's doesn't offer delicious, creamy mac n cheese baked in a cute little individual-sized bowl.  And they don't offer.... drum roll.... NINE DIPPING SAUCES.
