            "review": "We were trying to order out on a Wednesday night and decided to try this place out after Mint didn't answer their phone for about ten minutes. After confirming that they had some of the dishes we were intending to order at Mint (even though they weren't listed on the menu), we placed the order and they had it ready within 25 minutes. Inside there were only two other tables having dinner, but it was around 9:30 at night. Everything came out perfect and they took a lot of time and effort in wrapping our dishes for take out. We ordered the paneer tikka masala, rogan josh, chicken vindaloo, chicken biryani, and garlic naan. All delicious but my favorite was probably the biryani and rogan josh. Highly recommended for dinner."

            "review": "I have to admit I am a Food Network fan so when I saw Rachel Ray review Origin India so highly I got the idea to treat my wife to a nice dinner a bit out of our usual price range. She loves Indian food and it was her B-day so we splurged. \n\nI made online reservations but they were not needed at all, the place was all but empty. We had to wait while the manager interviewed a prospective employee but that turned out bad, voices were raised and we were caught in the middle. Oh well.\n\nThe ambiance was nice, the lighting was low but not like dining in the dark like some places I have gone. As we were seated we were given the wine and drink menu and the dinner menus. A quick note: the menus were dirty and stained from drinks or whatever. This was immediately off-putting because in a place with as high a Zagat Rating of 26/21/21 I would have expected more. OK, maybe I expect too much.\n\nSo, the option, bottled or LV tap for water. Let me say up front, I am not paying $8.00 for a bottle of Pellegrino (price not listed, so I am assuming)  that is $2.00 in the store. Local is fine thank you. Am I cheap? No, I am in this restaurant, but I am thrifty, no need to be hosed. Then it took 5 minutes just for water to be served and another 10 minutes for Iced Tea. The tea was a black tea, refreshing, but not unusually so.\n\nI think the staff had to be bored as we had like three different waiters. I was not certain who was serving what and that felt a little odd. We went on to order the Raisin and Apricot Naan which was delicious and an appetizer of Chicken Tikka that was very good. I am not sure it was actually Chicken Tikka, it was not spicy at all except for what looked and tasted like spice grape leaves holding the appetizer to the plate, but it was good.\n\nThe entree for me was a Moulard duck leg confit coated in ginger, garlic, cinnamon, honey and orange zest, served with butter poached potato and sweet and sour kumquat marmalade and my wife had Southern Indian style diced lamb stir fry diced lamb stir fry with curry leaves, black mustard seeds, whole Kashmiri chilli and coconut, served with lemon rice. Here is where Origin India shined. Both plates were wonderful to look at and the taste was marvelous. They have earned the 26 Zagat Food Rating (should be 27 in my book).\n\nFor dessert we tried the \"Indian Donut Holes\" and while tasty, a bit of a disappointment. Oh well.\n\nThe atmosphere was disturbed while we were there by a guy yelling into his cell phone. If I had my way cell phones would be discouraged in a fine dining establishment, they are so annoying. But management just let this guy yammer away even when they saw the dirty looks we and others in the restaurant were giving him.\n\nIn all our dining experience was about two hours and that was expected. I have to admit that although the food was superb, they overall experience lacked polish that for the prices charged I would have expected. They attempted to provide a high dining atmosphere but fell short on the details like not replacing silver in a timely manner and by letting drinks to be emptied before refilling. I did not expect the classic \"crumbing the table\" but the little things seemed to add up.\n\nIf the prices were a little more reasonable for the experience I would be a frequent diner, but the tab was a bit too steep to make it a regular thing."

This used to be our first spot to suggest when we have visitors from out of town.   But these days I am hesitant as I am not sure what the experience will be that particular day.  Portions used to be larger and prices were lower.  Also hotness of the food seems to be very inconsistent.  I have ordered hot before and did not think it was spicy enough and on other occasions we ordered medium to hot but it was so spicy no one could even eat.  It was a bit embarrassing as we were there with friends and we had hyped up the place so much to them.  \nNan bread has always been good!  5 stars on the Nan bread!\nI agree with some of the other reviewers services is a hit or miss, and yes, the staff is not the friendliest!\nHope they improve and I would love to continue coming to this restaurant!"

Lunch is almost half the price of dinner and and they serve the same portion of food. \n\nMy favorite is chicken Mak Markani. I love spicy food so I always ask for INDIAN spicy not AMERICAN spicy when it comes to spice level. \n\nThe decor is just OK. too much brown which makes it gloomy but staff is really nice.

            "review": "First time trying Indian food, this place is dark inside, a bit too dark. Once seated we noticed there was only 3 other tables occupied inside the restaurant, a bit slow for dinner time. The food is expensive, especially considering that you have to pay separately for rice or bread. We ordered a chicken mukhani, a lamb nihari and a bowl of steamed rice. The chicken was flavorful and spicy, to my liking but the lamb was a bit plain that it made the lamb overwhelm the dish. Portions were a bit small for such an expensive dish that does not come with rice or bread. Service however was well. We had a living social coupon here, and even with that in our bill it was not all that worth it. Good for an experience but not worthy enough to come back. I would give it a 2.5 but bumped it to 3 because with a yelp check in I got a free manga lassi. This place might be more worth it during lunch or brunch buffet."

            "review": "My sister and I used the \"$20 for $40\" promotion last night at Origin India. It was my second time eating there but my first time since going vegan (my sister is vegan, too). We had pretty much decided on what we were going to order when my sister asked our server, Senad, a few questions about butter, meat broth, etc. He said, \"You're vegan? We have a vegan menu,\" and took our menus and returned with a comprehensive two-page all vegan menu. My sister and I were pumped! The only problem with the vegan menu is THERE ARE NO PRICES! That really annoyed me. We asked Senad what the prices were and he said something along the lines of, \"oh the prices are just like the regular menu.\" Not good enough. It seems so strange to go to the trouble of making up a whole vegan menu and then not provide prices. \n\nThe food came out quickly. We ordered 3 vegan samosas ($7) and they were fantastic. The rest of the food came out shortly thereafter. We ordered Baingan Bhartha ($11), Aloo Gobi ($11), and Bhindi Masala ($11). Since none of those dishes come with rice we ordered Pulao Rice ($4), which is basmati rice with saffron. We also ordered Roti ($2). Everything was delicious. The Bhindi Masala (an orka dish) was my favorite (I think my sister's, too). It had a lot of different, intense flavors. The Baingan Bartha (eggplant) was really good, too. It had a little bit of a spicy kick. The Aloo Gobi (curried potatoes and cauliflower) was also really good. I am a sucker for potatoes. \n\nOver all it was a great meal. The priceless menu was annoying, and Senad was an overbearing server, but the food and the rest of the wait staff made up for the shortcomings. Excellent food! Vegan friendly. Make sure to ask for the vegan menu."

This place had a 4 star rating on yelp so we thought we should give it a try for lunch.\n\nWe walked in and the first thing I said to myself was, \"wow, this is nice.\" The decorations were very well done, and it looked upscale unlike your typical Indian restaurant. \n\nUnfortunately, the lunch buffet was atrocious. There were very few choices for vegetarians, a rarity in Indian restaurants. The only vegetarian appetizer was the vegetable pakoras, which they had ran out of when we got there. They eventually made more, but we were already half way through our meal. To their credit, the pakoras were good. They had a half-ass salad along with some kidney beans. \n\nBoth vegetarian sabzis were potato based: aloo matter and aloo gobi. Wouldn't you think not to make two very simialar dishes? It seemed like they forgot to put salt in the aloo matter while the aloo gobi tasted like there was twice as much salt as needed. The quality of the ingredients were good, but the taste was totally lacking.\n\nAlso, they had rice, but there was no form of dhal. Who eats plain rice? I understand non-Indians will just mix one of the sabzis, but if you are an Indian restaurant, please make the effort and don't cheap out. \n\nFinally, there was no dessert at all. What kind of lunch buffet doesn't have a dessert dish?\n\nThe service was bad as well. They clearly paid more attention to those customers ordering off the menu. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my glass of water refilled, and there were only 3 other parties there at the time. \n\nThe other good thing they had was their naan. It was delivered hot and fresh to your table, and it was done perfectly. The only  two things that were good were the naan and pakora.\n\nThis place maybe different for dinner or if you order off the menu, but don't even think about going here for the lunch buffet, especially if you are vegetarian."

The actual chicken in the salad was delicious and tender, but the \"caesar\" part is taken too literally, and definitely more than a \"take\"- note: nobody actually wants to pay good money for a standard caesar salad.   Although, I would have liked some naan bread to go with it but I did not think it too fitting to pay for an additional item for a meal that already totaled more than $30 when my purpose is to dine, catch up on the news in the paper, and go.  On that note, it's probably a decent place for a date what with the mood lighting, attentive service, and attractive setting."

When you get down to it and have questions about the details of items on the menu..... they don't care to answer questions about their food and I soon learned why. I ordered veggie dishes, my partner the typical tika masala. I inspected my food and it had the weirdest smell......After asking questions, we found out this place does not specialize in making fresh food with quality ingredients. Much of the food is processed and comes from cans and containers. I was told directly by my server that the eggplant in the baingan bharta was from a can! I have heard it all. Who the heck uses eggplant from a can in an Indian restaurant? Oh the people at Origin India. Who would have THUNK a fresh dish like baingan bharta could stand up with such yuckiness with someone who knows better?  OMG it was so digsusting. It looked like vomit on a plate. And it smelled like some dangerous chemical which prompted my questions to begin with.....Origin India should be ashamed of themselves for serving this garbage and having the nerve to say this food was prepared by anyone claiming themselves to be a \"Chef\".

I lived in London for several years, which has some of the best curry houses out there. I know what good curry is, and Origin just doesn't have it.\n\nPerhaps the fusion menu is somewhat better than the traditional menu, but I was in the mood for curry so I stuck with the traditional. We ordered 4 different dishes, 2 mains and 2 sides. We had a curried lamb shank, a prawn dish, mutter paneer and dal mahkani. \n\nLet me be clear, the curry was not necessarily bad, it just wasn't that good. Each of the dishes tasted exactly the same, and looked much the same. The food was bathed in some sort of bitter tasting dark-colored gravy. It would have been fine as a stand alone dish, but getting 4 plates of exactly the same flavor/texture just didn't do it for me. \n\nThe other off putting thing about the place was the turn and burn type service. It was rushed even though we had reservations, and it wasn't that busy. The server didn't come back once except to bring the check. Also, the bus boy came to take our plates away 2 mins after being served, and before we had even started on the food! Oh, and it's overpriced too.\n\nI have to say, I am disappointed.

I travel a lot and have to admit this is one of the worst Indian restaurants I have ever eaten.   Honestly I have had better Indian food in Kansas City. The food had no flavour.  I think my mom could cook better than this.  The buffet has no rhyme or reason to it,  there are choices like Fried fish and then you have paneer with some weird sauce and vegetables.  I eat Indian food twice a week and was really disappointed.  As I spoke to a few people in the restaurant, most were tourists so you get the impression that they probably do not have a lot of repeat clientele.  Would not recommend and will not go back."

We don't go out to Indian food very often because it is soooooo overpriced in vegas and we often make our own instead.   We tried it because of the groupon.  The service was disorganized and not the friendliest.  I think only one guy actually smiled.  Our child has a lactose allergy and the waiter told us they could separate out the cheese naan.  They forgot.  There was confusion about where they put the groupon and our bill had to be redone.  Nothing too big a deal but the lack of friendly attentive service was surprising considering the expense.  The food itself was some of the best we have had in vegas.  There are not that many good Indian places here.  Don't know if I would go back considering the prices and mediocre service.  BTW if a decent Indian place ever opened with significantly lower prices like they have in other cities, we would be there EVERY week.  I don't know whats up with the jacked up prices for Indian food.  We end up going out for Malaysian or Aftican food as an alternative that is more affordable.\nAlso, I am married to an Indian and so we know our Indian food."

All the food was fresh, refilled continuously and plentiful for our small party. There are enough tables to get seated right away. Here you won't have to wait like other food joints. This is important when you only have an hour for lunch. \n\nI have had them at the convention center before and by all means, this buffet was the best deal off the strip. At $10.95 for the lunch buffet from 11:30am-2:00pm, I got enough to eat I skipped dinner. \n\nThe service was impeccable. The wait staff was courteous and always refilling our drinks, bringing over more Nan and asking if we needed anything else. Right now, you get a free Mango Lassi (Mango Smoothie) when you check in. Lassi is a yogurt smoothie with fresh fruit and spices. It's thick and creamy and helps cool your palate if you are eating something spicy.  \n\nThe buffet had many choices, from traditional Pulao rice to 5 different curries and 3 choices of chicken dishes, salads, vegan dishes, and plenty of veggies to get your daily requirement. It was very filling. With our food came a large basket of 3 different kinds of Nan to dip in your food sauces. Nan is Indian flat bread used to eat your food (like a tortilla). All 3 kinds were delicious, Apricot and raisin filled, cheese filled and garlic & coriander topped. My favorite was the garlic. It added an extra kick to every savory bite of Chicken Mahkani I ate. I also tried the house salad, which is your traditional restaurant house salad for those watching their figure. The vegetable samosa has a little kick but tastes like a party in your mouth. It's too good not to try at least once. The Chicken Curry, Lamb Tikka Masala, and Palak Paneer were authentic and fresh. Hard to come by at a buffet. \n\nDessert, where to we begin? (Yes I had dessert at lunch, YOLO!). To try something different beyond the typical chocolate lava cake you find at every restaurant (gag!), we went for the Almond Kulfi (thick creamy almond ice cream) and the Gajar Ka Halwa (Carrots with raisins and slivered almonds cooked in cream, served warm). It was delicious! You have to try it during your visit. \n\nOrigin India is the spot for Indian food near the strip. You have to give it a try."

I think they move back and forth between old school and noveau, but each time it's been delicious.  Their staff is well trained  to interpret customer nuances and are very knowledgeable in their craft.  Last meal? Veg samosas ( non-traditional but tasty wrap, scrumptuous filling) and chicken tikka (perfectly grilled, seasoned and juicy).  Followed with delicious saag paneer (cheese quality was phenomenal, wonder if they actually make it in house or they buy it) and the kabob platter, scooped with plain naan.  I was not that impressed with the lamb, but still good...and the tikka this time around was just a bit dry.  Those two details and the slightly higher prices (with a la carte breads & rice) may take away a bit, but not a full star.  Great meal, great service, very comfortable and tasteful ambiance (definitely Indian, yet with a very crisp feel).  Every meal? Maybe not...but definitely perfect for a night out or special hangout.

But for the most part, I'm not a fan of the crowds, of the gambling, or really of the mind-numbing lack of choices in things to do and see. My food experiences in Vegas have been pretty sub-par. Until Origin India, that is.\n\nI first found this place about 4 years ago, when I was last in town for a conference. And short of eating in homes in India (which, yes, I have done), it was the best Indian food in my life. I was introduced to the glories of beet and carrot halwa -- a dairy dessert made of beets and/or carrots. Sounds disgusting, right? It's not. It's delicious. And, I have dreamed of their halwa (occasionally I have literally dreamed of it) since then.\n\nSo I am back in town on business. And rather than eating at one of the places on the Strip, I hurry back to Origin India as soon as I can.\n\nIt's still delicious. But, it's not the same. I see from another post that there is a new chef. Perhaps that's the issue. I feared it simply suffered from too much exposure -- upon my arrival, I saw that so-called \"chef\" Rachel Ray had discovered the place, and that it subsequently enjoyed a rise in popularity. And, as so often happens with small places that get discovered, they sometimes rest on their laurels.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- some of the things were still excellent. Their naan was fantastic, for example. And the channa was top-notch. But, serving the potato soup in a tall shot glass made for nice presentation, but didn't cover for the fact that it was kind of bland. And, it didn't really help the diner, as it never allowed the soup to cool to a low enough temperature to comfortable eat/drink it.\n\nI ordered the tasting menu. And my main course -- the channa - was delicious. But other things just felt a bit sub-par. The sherbet served between courses felt good to the palate, but it was from the grocery. And the complimentary dumplings were just pakoras in a sauce.\n\nSo, Origin India, I still heart you. And I'm hoping you get your groove back, because I used to tout you as the best Indian restaurant in the country. And now, all I can say is that you are a great alternative to the poor choices on the strip."

If I were to have judged based solely on the time I came for a lunch during the week, I might have gone with two stars.  They didn't want to serve me off the menu, the server was rude and unhelpful, and the food wasn't anything special.  Or there was the time I came on a late Sunday afternoon and I didn't have anyone even talk to me for the first 20 minutes after I had been seated.... \n\nSo, why am I going with four stars?  Well, when this place is good, it's five-star good.  The servers are friendly and attentive, the food is tasty and flavorful, and you can usually find a deal to help on the cost.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and makes a great date spot.\n\nWe are always seated quickly even when the place is packed.  Usually we have someone ready to get our drink orders asap (except on super busy Sunday afternoons) and they are pretty good about refills.\n\nMy husband and I always order the same items at every Indian restaurant: a mango lassi, garlic naan, vegetable samosas, saag paneer, and vegetable korma.  All of these are done well here.  I wish the mango lassi was a little bigger and the garlic naan a little more doughy, but overall everything is great.  This is the place where I found enormous chunks of cheese in my saag paneer and that put a big grin on my face.\n\nJust a few fyi's: sign up for their frequent diner card and get $15 off every time you spend $100, find coupons through yelp/restaurant.com/etc, I've noticed their food is a tad spicier than other Indian places so be careful if you don't like heat, I don't really recommend coming at lunch considering the difference in service I've had at dinner time, their food is a little more upscale so they may have some different items than other Indian restaurants.\n\nAll that being said, the majority of the time Origin India is great.  Just please don't hate on me if you catch them on a crazy Sunday afternoon."

I thoroughly enjoyed it even when I kept scalding my fingers just trying to pick the glass up. \n\nThe Naan basket was full of awesome goodness. We couldn't believe the amount of bread we got. \n\nThen we had a serving of three types of meat--all seasoned and grilled to just the right state of done-ness. The shrimp was fine, but the lamb was heavenly.\n\nMy favorite dish, of course, was the vegetarian curry. I almost forgot about the other vegetarian dishes that came with the curry. I tried to look for their names on the web but somehow, none of the items on the menu rang a bell, so perhaps, the Chef came up with some extemporaneous selections for that night. And we were the happier for it.\n\nNow, the true GEM of the evening dinner, was Joseph, the bartender. But to call him that is truly inaccurate. I call him The Alchemist. \n\nI'm not even fond of martinis (never liked it), but Joseph's original concoctions, from fresh juices, herbs, spices, really intrigued me. He said that a good martini comes from a mixture of several types of vodkas or gins. He also said that Bombay gin makes a fine martini because of its herbal composition. I tend to agree with him, based on how magnificent the martinis he made for me turned out. \n\nSo, for final thoughts--may be too pricey for the dinner portions, or for the tasting menu (but I'm charging it to experience). But a strong 4+ Stars for \"The Alchemist\"."

It was on the list of places I got a discount on for the bite card thing they gave me through booking my trip to casablanca express.\nThe food was so yummy! I ordered...you know what, I don't know what I ordered, but it was a veggie dish, vegetable dumplings with like yogurt sauce or something....my hubby ordered the chicken stuffed with prunes and mushrooms....it was good! We also ordered a plain naan and got a free appetizer for checking in (stuffed mushrooms). I wasn't really a fan of the stuffed mushrooms, but the rest of the food was delicious. I thought the food wouldn't be enough, but the food was actually too much for us in one sitting. Just the right amount of flavor, and our food didn't smell like it would be seeping out of someone's armpits later on in the Vegas heat. \n\nThe atmosphere was calm and dark and romantic, lots of candles....and people slowly began to trickle in as evening wore on."

If the people dining there are of the same national origin as the food, I know it is going to be authentic.  This was the case at Origin India last night.  The majority of diners were indeed Indian.  \n\nMy roommate and I went last night.  As we walked in we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was very friendly and seemed surprised that I had made a reservation.  Hey, I saw the option on the site and gave it a shot.  A reservation really was not necessary though.  There were plenty of open tables in a restaurant that, from the outside, looks small.  Just because there were plenty of tables available does not mean there were no diners.  There were several tables being used.  As we were seated towards the back of the restaurant I looked around and quickly felt relaxed.  It was dimly lit and I could hear Indian music playing softly in the background.  On the table was very heavy silverware and giant fancy folded cloth napkins.\n\nOur server was very attentive.  He came by frequently to ask if we were ready to order and again to check if we were enjoying our dining experience.  We were.  I ordered the chicken tikka makhani in the entree size (smaller portion served with rice).  My roommate ordered the family size home style chicken curry.  We both ordered naan.  I got the wild mushroom naan with truffle oil while he ordered the fresh garlic naan.  It was not unlike a good fresh pizza crust.  It was fluffy with a slight chew.  Very good for sopping up the left over sauce from the meal.  My makhani was good.  The chicken was very tender.  The sauce has a great spice.  The basmati rice was light and airy.  Amazing.  The chicken curry was good as well.  The sauce had a strong tomato flavor.  It was not quite like spaghetti sauce but reminiscent of though it had a curry taste to it as well.  What made the curry good was the fresh cilantro added on top.  It was refreshing.\n\nI am going to give Origin India four stars today though 3.5 would be most accurate.  The service could not have been better.  The food was very.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It is , however, priced high for the amount of food you receive.  I was not starving when I got home but I was not full either.  For $20 a person I expect to be full upon leaving and have leftovers to take home as well.  This was not the case.  Had it not been for my Groupon offer I would not have eaten here.  For this I must demote them to a 3.5 star rating."

So if I were around the area and was craving some Indian cuisine, I may consider going again.\n\nBut, our server totally ruined our experience.\n\nI went with two of my friends.  We were asking our server some questions about different dishes.  When we asked our server how big a dish was (we were trying to decide whether to order three or four different dishes), he made it sound like it was so little that it would be small for even one person.  He thought that we were going to order just one dish to share.  Once he realized that we were ordering multiple dishes, then and only then he gestured that the dish was bigger than what he had initially told us.\n\nWhen the food started coming out, we looked at each other incredulous because that particular dish we asked our server about was so big that two people could have eaten it and left the restaurant full.  It wasn't that we didn't want to order more dishes, we were just amazed how the server tried to manipulate his answer so that he would get us to order more.  Moreover, once the food came, the server never even bothered to come to our table again.  We left the restaurant shaking our heads."

I ended up getting the lamb stir-fry with lemon rice. It was only ok though. Don't get me wrong, I would order it again, But the description seemed better than the dish. My wife got the stripped bass. It came as a whole fish with the head and tail removed. Skin on and bone in tact. The flavor was amazing, just a little tough to chow down on 'cause you had to be careful about the bones. We also ordered two appetizers (waiters recommendation cause of 2-for-1 apps during happy hour). First we had scallops, which came tempura style. all I can say is YUM! And then we ordered an item called lamb kebabs. Instead what came out wasn't your traditional kebab. it was lamb meat with all the veggies rolled together in a spring roll looking dish. Not fried, (i don't think) and spicy! For me it was on the border of being too spicy, my wife LOVED them. We also ordered a wild mushroom and truffle oil bread. Now that was just plain good. \n\nResult: Food 5 Stars\n\nAs for our waiter, I would have to give him 3 stars. The reason we came in was because Origin India sent my wife a coupon for a free entree which we showed him at the beginning of the meal. He told us that was could order only one of the entrees as the free one, none of the family style selections, ok thats fine. He left to allow us to look over the menu. We knew our appitizer order. He recommended us to get two even though we only wanted one cause it was still happy hour. Well when the check came both appitizers were charged for and when I asked why he said that we could only use one discount at a time! WTF! You told us to get two! We ended up having it taken off. Also, after more review of the check they charged me an extra doller than what was listed on the menu for my beer. \n\nThe waiter was really insistent about selling my wife a cocktail. It got to the point of it being a little weird. She kept declining but he really pushed it. I understand up selling but after the customer declining at least 4-5 times, it was obnoxious.   \n\nOver all I liked it. I wasn't going to this restaurant for human interaction and great service, I was going to eat here. and the food was great. If you do go, just review the prices and the check very carefully!"

The restaurant is very attractive, modern, and upscale, and there isn't much in the decor to identify its ethnicity.  The lighting is soft and just right.  Our group filled most of the restaurant, but it's a testament to the very good service and attentiveness of management and staff that they were able to accommodate walk-in diners as well.\n\nOur group was served a buffet that was set up on a large, round table covered with a tablecloth.  It was an elegant change to the usual steam table lineup.  All of the dishes available to us were vegetarian, most likely chosen by the organization for religious-ish reasons.  There were vegetarian samosas, first bite-sized, later replaced with standard ones, and they were very tasty.  There were potato fritters, naan, vegetable biryani, and a scrumptious paneer dish that was spicy, but not enough to induce fire-breathing.  Bowls of raita, and the standard coriander and tamarind sauces also graced the serving table.\n\nServers removed plates promptly and were constantly refilling water glasses, and the manager was present and hands-on.\n\nOur dinner included a drink, but we had only a few choices.  I had a mango martini, small but delicious.  The restaurant has a full bar.\n\nI looked at the menu for the purpose of writing a concise review.  Many of the dishes are unique to Origin India.  I've been to many, many Indian restaurants, and there were more than a few that I've never seen anywhere.  The descriptions were very enticing.  On the down side, the menu is considerably smaller than most others, and the prices are high.  We will definitely be returning, though probably for special occasions because of those prices.  But I am giving Origin India a definite high-four!"

Samosas were beautifully presented on both visit, but not especially aromatic or unusual.\n\n(For the prices, compared to other Indian places in Las Vegas, I want a little extra dazzle, you see.)\n\nI avoided the vegetable dumplings on the second visit because when I had them before I found them very heavy and dull. But the baked baby eggplant I had instead didn't really deliver the variety and complexity promised by the menu description. It was, well, also kind of heavy and dull.\n\nMaybe I'm ordering \"wrong,\" but it's so easy to please me with Indian cuisine and any attempt at innovation that not finding a reason to go back to Origin makes me genuinely sad. The menu still looks so delicious! And, although service was slow and a bit inattentive on the busy night when we visited for dinner, the staff do seem so nice. (Note: the middle of the dining room can feel claustrophobic in the small space if it's busy. Hold out for an edge table.)\n\nBut the taste just doesn't deliver for me, and the cost doesn't justify a third chance, even with a coupon. (And these days there's always a coupon.) Maybe it's just the vegetarian items, but unless you're staying at the Hard Rock across the street without means of transportation, I'd try a few other places before going to Origin."

            "review": "Our second time at Origin India, and it was as good, or better than the first time.  We had tandoori chicken for appetizer - the best tandoori chicken ever.  Not that dyed red stuff you get most places, but moist, tender flavorful dark meat chicken (our fav!)  We ordered papadums and it arrived with two dipping sauces which were fabulous.  The papadums were light and delicious.  We then had lamb shank, baked cod and sag paneer, all of which were terrific and 2 orders of garlic naan  (oh the naan!) to sop up all the delicious sauces and juices.  Our waiter, Ahmed (an Egyptian, actually) went out of his way to make sure we were happy, and we appreciated his attention to detail.\n\nThe decor is simple but tasteful.  This has become our favorite Indian restaurant.  The bartender is on UTube making a couple of the imaginative cocktails the restaurant serves.  We didn't have one, but my husband did have a Cilantro Mojito, different but delicious.  \n\nWe ate early (about 5:30) but by the time we left at 7:00 the restaurant was mostly full, with a couple of large parties as well.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time, and I know we did.\n\nBringing the check to the table with the machine to run your credit card is definitely different, but lets you have the confidence that there is no-one fooling with your card.  We like that little bit of safety!"

We went on a Saturday lunch and they didn't offer any specials, except for the $30 Prix fixe meal for two.  \n\nThe food was okay, but I expected a fuller, richer flavor as the items seemed a bit bland to me for Indian food.  One of the chicken items tasted like Orange chicken from panda express and the other chicken dish used so much yogurt in it that it completely drowned out the spices, not to mention the impending bloating (dang Asian lactose intolerance genes!).  The rice wasn't aromatic like other basmati rice that I've had and the naan was a bit too thick for my tastes as I like 'em thin and crispy.\n\nI checked in on yelp and received a free appetizer, but the waiter gave me a little bit of flak for it because they said it wasn't on their system.  I was NOT about to pay $15 for 3 small pieces of dry lamb chop.  He finally conceded after tasting some of my Chinese haggling skills.\n\nI probably wouldn't come back, there's a whole bunch of other options in Vegas to eat at."

I can't even begin to name the dishes, but we had a lamb chop curry dish, and chicken curry dish, and they're both really good.  The chops were tender, and the spices were just right.  We also had some lentile soup, that was good too.  Then we had this thing that's almost like a spinach dip, except its mixed with butter/oil and chunks of Indian cheese that tasted like tofu!  That's spinach dish was probably my favorite, and its actually something that's not on the menu, and my Indian cusine expert friend asked for it."

The more expensive rice dishes aren't worth it, in my opinion.\n- Good variety of veggie dishes, though two are a bit greasy (the Baigan Bharta and Bhindi Masala) and they don't have Mushroom Masala.\n- Paneers are all very delicious, especially the Paneer Makhani and Paneer Rajastani which are exceptional.\n- If you want them, you'll need to ask for the complimentary Papadum (those thin lentil chips you can snack on before your meal arrives).  They used to always be provided without asking but they apparently stopped doing that; however, they are happy to provide them upon request.\n\nThe establishment:\n- Plates and silverware are very nice, NOT cheap\n- Seats are well-cushioned, high quality, and comfortable.  Nice tables.\n- Bathrooms have above average furnishings (granite counters, stone tiled walls)\n- Good overall furnishings, subdued lighting, not too loud; excellent for a date or conversation\n- Music is usually appropriate though once they were oddly playing 80's music\n\nThe service:\n- There is never a long wait for our food, even when they are relatively busy\n- Some of the waiters are a little on the reserved side (maybe it's an Indian thing?), but all of them are always very polite, friendly and eager to please without being overbearing."

You generally don't find Indian restaurant with good classy ambiance often. Food was also nice.\nCouple of things  I did not like -- \n1: Their service.  They are very very slow. We had to wait quite a long time after we ordered food.  \n2: They did not greet well when we entered in restaurant. (Hardly anyone noticed)\n3: We had to call someone to take order. No one came to ask whether we are ready for order or not. (we waited ~10 mins which is long time) \n4: After we finished, we had to call them for check. (we again waited ~5 to 10 mins) \n\nOverall, its good place for good indian food with good ambiance. \nYou need to be patient for slow service. \n\nGiving 3 stars because I am not satisfied with their service. (For food only I would give them 41/2)"

So i eat it a lot, cook it a lot, and love it a lot.\n\nSo far Vegas has been a big disappointment for indian food. Gaylord's wasn't great nor was Tamba. Origin India however was everything i hoped for. \n\nFor appetizers. I had the Bhajia and my girlfriend had the Aloo Mattar Tikki. For the first time in a long time i ordered better than her on appetizers. I'm not a huge bhajia fan but these were done perfectly. The Aloo Matter Tikki was also delicious and the presentation of both dishes were also great.\n\nFor mains. I was deciding between Paneer Shashlik or Paneer Shabnam $15 the manager recommended the Shabnam. The girlfriend ordered Chana Masala $13. Both dishes came with rice, naan and a small daal which i didn't realise and seems great value for money. Since i hadn't realised that i also ordered a daal palak as an accompaniment.\n\nThe Paneer Shabnam was absolutely delicious and the texture of the paneer also perfect. My girlfriend's Chana Masala was up until now the best and most well rounded Chana Masala i've ever tasted. Then on top of that the dark daal that came with my meal called Dal Bukhara was perfect too, extremely dark tasting. The manager asked how everything was and i said the daal was one of the best daals i've ever tasted, so then 5 minutes later he brings me another one out on the house. \n\nThe naans were also cooked to perfection with the crispy underside and very soft, air bread top.\n\nThe only small dissappointment was the Palak Daal and the Mango Lassi. The Palak Daal was too vinegary tasting for me and i couldn't get through it.  The mango lassi was more like a mango smoothie than Lassi, but still tasted good, my taste might be swayed by the lassi being served in a cocktail glass which seemed strange.\n\nLastly, inside is very very nicely decorated and the service is extremely attentive. \n\nAll in all, the best Indian i have eaten in Vegas and the third best Indian restaurant i've ever been too. Passe thru Indian in Malaysia #1 and East Z East Manchester England #2. \n\nHighly recommended."

I know, I wouldn't have ordered them either -- but they were really spectacular.  If you'll only eat rare lamb, get over it -- the \"overcooking\" is what made this such a standout -- I mean falling apart tender, melt in your mouth, finger licking good lamb (when was the last time you said that?)\n\nThe tandoori shrimp -- overcooked too and note to chef in the kitchen-- overcooking shrimp doesn't do anything for the critters...it just makes them mushy.\n\nWe also had tandoori chicken legs -- haven't seen chicken legs on a menu ever...they were good!  But not as finger lickin good as the lamb.   \n\nBreads in Indian restaurants are almost always great -- these didn't disappoint.\n\nNo one does Poori anymore though -- why?  \n\nI read on their website that they give discounts for UNLV students/faculty and if you're local -- but I forgot when the bill came... \n\nThey had a fairly decent wine list which surprised us -- but years ago, my friend taught me to drink Long Island Iced Teas with Indian food and it's a happy habit that I haven't broken, nor frankly feel a need to.  I don't drink LIITs any other time, except with Indian food either -- so if you've not tried this little combo -- feel free -- just have a designated driver, and drink plenty of water...  Theirs are lethal!\n\nWe ordered one dessert -- probably because the cocktails made us giddy and stupid -- sweet, milky balls (yes, that was the name...)  Um...we should have stopped while we were ahead, but it was good for a laugh!  (Yes, we often have 2 year old sense of humor...)\n\nWe'd definitely go back for the lamb, bread and cocktails though!"

BUT, I can see where restaurant staff would be like \"wtf\". Anyway, he ordered to go and then we showed up and decided to eat in.  They unpacked the food and gave us great service without any complaints or problems even though over the phone he had insisted they have it ready in 3 minutes. (Lol).   Then he asked for ice for the free mango lassi and it took FOREVER.  He was starting to get annoyed until we looked over and one of the staff was coming in from outside with two bags of ice.  They actually sent someone out to hurry and get ice for just us (they had just opened).  It was one of those man-did-I-have-the-wrong-idea moments.   \n\nWe ended up eating here three days in a row, which I am not suggesting but my husband loves tikka masala and he is like a 12 year old who could eat the same thing every day of his life.  The butter chicken, which is basically the same thing, was better than the Tikka masala so he ate that the other two days instead after trying mine.  \n\nEverything we ate was good.

            "review": "My friend and I were in the mood for some Indian cuisine. 4 stars on Yelp is pretty good, right? Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about this place is it has a nice interior, more upscale than your typical Indian establishment. Otherwise, the food was decidedly mediocre and the service was absolutely atrocious, some of the worst I've experienced in a long time. But let's start from the beginning...\n\nOn a big banner right outside the restaurant, they advertised a 3-course dinner for two for $29.99. Upon inquiring about this option, our waiter informed us that special was no longer being offered and they've been meaning to take it down. However, they did have a 5-course tasting menu, served family-style, for $45 per person! Now either the waiter was bullshitting us or their website which advertises the same special is out-of-date as well. Either way, this is what you call a classic \"bait and switch\" and FALSE advertising! We should have taken the hint and walked out then, but we were hungry. Unfortunately this same thought would be a recurring theme throughout the rest of the evening. So we asked what was included in the 5-course tasting menu and were not terribly excited by what we heard and it didn't seem worth anywhere near $90 for the two of us. We asked for a \"few more minutes\" to peruse the menu.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, we decided to get the sweet apricot and raisin naan ($4), chicken tikka makhani ($13), seven spice veal ($25), baby eggplant ($11), and 2 side dishes of chana massala and aloo gobi ($7 each). Oh and we had to pay another $3 for a single order rice because none of the entrees came with any! We ended up waiting another 15 minutes before another waiter spotted us looking a bit perturbed and asked if we needed anything. We told him we were ready to order. I thought he was going to take our order but instead he just told our original waiter that we were ready and would be \"right with us\". Our waiter was running a couple's credit card with one of those portable terminals right at their table. After the receipt was signed, the waiter continued to idly chat with them for another 5 minutes or so. Then our waiter disappeared into the kitchen or God knows where for another 10 minutes before finally coming to take our order. He apologized for us waiting \"a few minutes\" (yeah right, try half an hour). I would be more understanding if they were really busy, but less than 1/5 of the tables were occupied. I know, I know, we should've walked out already.\n\nSo finally our order is in, but we wait and wait and we wait some more. We continue to watch other customers who sat down after us and ordered after us, get their food first and in one case, actually pay the bill and leave! At this point I am so incredibly green with envy of the customers who have the \"other waiter\". After about half an hour, they finally bring out all the food at once. At this point, we were absolutely ravenous, but our spirits lifted in the hopes that it would be worth the wait.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food satiated our hunger pangs, it was substandard Indian fare. The naan was not crispy at all but rather thick and gummy. It didn't contain very much apricot or raisin and no chutney, tamarind, mint, or any kind of condiments were offered. The chicken makhani, usually one of my favorites, was kind of bland. It lacked the spicy complexity that a good curry should have. The chicken didn't seem to be marinated at all. It was dry and was probably cooked separately and then tossed into the curry at the end. The aloo gobi was mostly potato and contained very little cauliflower. We both got bitefuls of undercooked, semi-raw potato as well. The chana massala, veal, and baby eggplant dishes fared no better.\n\nDuring this time, no one stopped by to ask how the food was. Nobody offered to refill our nearly empty glasses of water until we were ready to pay the check. After asking for the check, we waited over 15 minutes before our waiter returned and was expecting to collect the check. When we explained that we still had not received the check, he disappeared for another 4-5 minutes before finally returning with our check. We usually pay via credit card, but decided that we better settle up in cash lest we want to spend another half an hour waiting. I almost never leave no tip, but I'm thinking this is one of the rare situations that qualify. However, my friend lobbies hard to leave at least 10%. As we're walking back to our cars, a Black crack whore tries to solicit us. Ah, a fitting end to such a memorable evening!\n\nHere's the executive summary: nice interior ambiance, over-priced mediocre food, horrendous service. I am sorely tempted to give this 1-star but since the food was at least edible (except for the undercooked potatoes) I suppose it just BARELY merits 2 stars. Take my advice: save your money AND time. Don't do it. Just go somewhere else, like Mount Everest, Namaste, or Samosa Factory."

I picked a one meat, one veggie plate with the lamb and something, I don't remember now. It didn't look appetizing but it was the most appealing thing behind the glass, but the stuff looked as if it had been sitting around for hours. OK, whatever, I didn't eat breakfast and I need to eat something. So I take a few bites of the veggie with some of the rice. It doesn't taste bad, but it was cool, not hot or even warm.\n\nAfter a few bites, I have to run to a bathroom, and I pitched the rest of the meal in the trash. I didn't even get to the lamb.\n\nLess than 12 hours later I had chills, cold sweats and felt nauseous. I missed an entire day of the show I was attending. Thanks guys, you're sure swell!"

They server told me that I had to wait 'til 10 pm to place my order. I waited patiently, and one of the owners came over and apologized. \nHe went ahead and took my order. I tend not to eat fish anywhere, so he recommended the Old Delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce, served with pulao rice. \nI took it to go.

Ok, let's continue. \nSo, it was basically like this for the rest of the meal; 1 or 2 spoonfuls of Old Delhi chicken and rice. \nOverall, I would def. come here again.

It was a ghost town - nobody else was in there. Due to this observation, we immediately thought it was one of those restaurants that close in between lunch and dinnertime to partake in the \"siesta,\" but our waitress promptly darted out and greeted us, seating us at one of the many empty sea of tables.\n\nFirst impression: Fancy and proper table settings (the silverware already set, along with a water goblet, and the pyramid napkin-fold). Also, the leather seats exuded an executive-style feeling to the whole atmosphere. Very nice and well-kept.\n\nI had the PALAK PANEER and my boyfriend had the KALI MIRCH KA MURGH. We shared some naan bread and steamed rice between us with our main dishes. Our waitress made me a sample shot of the MANGO LASSI, which I ultimately ended up getting. (Its consistency is like yogurt for those that don't know. It was a nice contrast to the entree.) Overall, we both agreed that the food was very good - tangy infused with spices, flavorful and fresh. Even his ginger ale seemed like it was just made from scratch. Our taste palates were satisfied, and our waitress (having just one table to attend to) was very attentive. People slowly trickled in as we finished. I found out that there is a happy hour at 5. \n\nMy only COMPLAINT: The prices seemed a bit high, especially for an off-the-strip restaurant. If you look at its surrounding neighbors, you've got a Johnny Rocket's on one side and Paradise Cantina on the other. There are many Indian places near the vicinity of the university, and this ranked higher on the price scale. My dish was priced okay at $12.95, but my boyfriend's dish was $16 and his ginger ale was $4.50. It seemed to me more like a dinner. (Browsing the menu, some dishes went into the high $20-$30 ranges.) Our overall tab would have been about $50 for two people for just a late lunch. Luckily, I had a $15 certificate to use. I guess you're paying for the ambience.\n\n (Side note: The bathrooms are amazing! Just the right finishing touches and amazingly clean! The ladies' room even had sample hand salts to use.)"

I'm disappointed because they were so good and the service was so amazing before and this time around it was just not.\n\nMy friend and I walk in, get seated, and are immediately approached by a waiter inquiring on our water preference. We receive our menus and start talking and realize that we have no drink menu. Okay? Don't the two usually go together? Mid conversation we're interrupted by another waiter after we just looked at the newly received drink menu. We said we need more time and he saunters off. The menu has become this bizarre fusion without the proper names of the dishes, so it's like uh what? Basically they give you the recipe without saying what it is. My friend ordered the chicken tikka salad that was served over a minuscule bed of coarsely chopped iceberg and romaine and I ordered the lamb curry stir fry, which was really lamb vindaloo. We ordered some samosas and apricot and raisin naan to start. The waiter inquires how spicy I wanted the vindalooo and I say as spicy as it gets and that we would like the naan and the samosas to start. Please tell me why it took 10 minutes to get our cocktails in a bar that was not busy? I mean literally the bartender was just standing there doing nothing and there was no one at the bar. When we received our cocktails that were $10 in small martini glasses we were less then impressed. I ordered the orange peace margarita and my friend ordered a blackberry pomegranate concoction. We both slowly drank them, but they were not that good. So our naan arrives at the table as well as our samosas in a little tower shape with a nice presentation. The flavors were good, albeit dry. 4 minutes after that he brings the chicken tikka salad to the table after he asked when we were taking our order if we wanted the salad with the samosas or with the lamb. We said with the lamb since that was her entree. After 5 additional minutes obviously my lamb wasn't coming and he forgot they were supposed to be served together. So she ate and I just sat there. Fun times. After she was done, the lamb got brought to the table and I literally could barely eat it. My fault because I said as spicy as it gets, but that was ridiculous. I can usually take spicy but damn. He asked how everything was, I said really really spicy and he brought over some raita.  It still wasn't good after that, and when he inquired later on how I was doing, I still said it's really spicy and he awkwardly laughed and walked away. He didn't ask do you want me to have the kitchen make another one for you? Nope, he just giggled and walked away. WTF?! Now I could understand if I ate half of the dish but I had a little corner of my plate with the lamb on it and some rice. It felt like it was his first waiting tables job and it was just off. Yes, the waiter was nice but it felt like a poorly operated faux fine dining experience. They were not trained properly on etiquette, nor timing. We paid our $60 bill and left. I boxed up my vindaloo and took it home and ended up just throwing it away anyway because I knew I wasn't going to eat it, I just couldn't justify spending $21 for something and not eating it. Oh and also, the lamb didn't come with rice it was a $3 upcharge. Ridiculous. \n\nAfter the great experience I had to that is just disappointing, and it was my birthday last night to boot. I'm kind of undecided if I want to go back after that."

We got 1 vegetable samosa appetizer, 1 lamb and rice entree, 1 chicken tikka masala, 1 garlic naan, and 1 cola cola. It took an hour to come out, and people were getting their food way before us that came in after us. A very nice man came to our table to apologize for the wait and assured us he would take 15-20% off our bill for waiting. We thought this was very kind and didn't expect it at all. We didn't complain once for waiting, so really it was very surprising to us. Anyway, or food finally comes out and it was killer good. We enjoyed it very much, but when it came you refills on my husband water, the servic lacked. We had to wait a good amount of time for our bill but when it did come we explained we had bought their yelp $15 for $25 deal. The same kind man that said he'd discount or bill 15-20% was confused by their yelp deal and said he'd have to speak to the manager. Some time later he comes back and looks at it again and says he'll just take the $25 off. But then we no longer were compensated the 15-20% for waiting. Okay, fine we understand. Our bill AFTER being discounted the $25 was still $63!! So look at the receipt and see that we have been charged for a lot of things we did not order. We were charged for 2 vegetable samosa's, 1 kingfish entree, 1 tikka masala, 1 glass of merlot, 1 lamb entree (i can't recall the name), 1 other entree (i can't recall the name), 1 coke, 2 garlic naans, and another appetizer I can't remember the same of. I bright the receipt to our server and said hold on, you way over charged us. She knew immediately what we really ordered and ate and really changed our ticket which ended up being $24 after taking the $25 off!! But the extra shady part is is that she was helping the kind man with ringing out our ticket that they way over charged us for! I definitely think they thought they were going to get away with overcharging us. It is so disappointing because the food really was wonderful. We still tipped $8 even though the service wasn't that great and they tried to scam us, but that's the right thing to do. We will find somewhere else to eat Indian food rather than going back here."

We showed up a little after 6 and was strongly advised by our waiter to get drinks and apps because they were bogo during happy hour. We ordered drinks and apps and an entree each. The drink I ordered was Shandi something and it was spicy, peppery and perfect. My friend had 'The Maria' . It was fruity and on the sweet side but equally as delicious. The appetizers we got were plated beautifully. The scallops were my favorite, nice and crispy outside yet tender and mild on the inside. The stuffed portobella mushroom was tasty too, I just would have liked it served warmer since it was deep fried. I had the lamb shank after being advised by the waiter it was much better than the lamb stir fry i ordered at first. The lamb shank was every bit of amazing as it was expected to be. The sauce was extremely spicy, flavorful as well as hot. I coughed after my first bite. The lamb itself was so tender it fell off the bone. I could cut the meat with my fork. My friend had the baby eggplant dish and loved it. Now I bring myself to the downer of this meal....the LACK of SERVICE! We were never offered refills on our drinks, yet our glasses of water were refilled continually by the busboy. Once we were finished with our meal we sat and waited for our check for over 30 minutes with our waiter nowhere in sight. Thank God my friend was so entertaining or else I would have been more upset. After 40 minutes had gone by I started flagging down anyone i could find to ask for our check. I asked the bartender, the hostess, the busboy...then finally our waiter appears and presents us with our check. The check was wrong of course because he had charged us full price for the drinks and apps he worked so hard to sell us on for happy hour. I could understand though since it was now 8:15. I quickly jumped up and followed him back to the kitchen and asked him if he could fix our check. His response was \"I will speak with the manager about it\" to which I responded \"We are in a hurry!\" Then he said \"Okay I'll take it off right now.\" Hahaha I think I scared myself a little there, but whatever it worked! We finally got out of there. It was really busy for a Tuesday night, but nonetheless that is no excuse for poor service. \n\nFood = 5 stars \nService = 0 stars"

The servers are really professional, but might I say a little too professional if that makes sense? Somewhat uncomfortable and stuffy but very polite nonetheless.\n\nHYDERABADI CHICKEN  $16.00\nChicken cooked with southern Indian spices and coconut milk sauce that is not too rich with a subtly sweet warm and spicy flavor.

Now we have our regular Indian restaurant that we love, but that is on the other side of town and we were meting friends close by, so Origin it is.\n\nThe decor is nice, the private dinning areas are very nicely done, a different tone from the normal Indian restaurant for sure, it would echo what was to come.\n\nIf you are expecting your normal Indian restaurant menu, you're in for a shock, however, on closer inspection, the regular menu items are there, just hidden behind the words of someone who had way to much time on their hands when the menu was put together.\n\nFor example :\n\nOld Delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce.\n\nThe vast majority of Indian places would simply call that Chicken Tikka Massala,  \n\nBut you get my point, study the menu and the regulars are there, also, the wait staff were more than happy to run through the menu.\n\nThere are also some \"non-standard\" dishes, but those will have to wait till next time as we were really in the mood for Indian comfort food.\n\nSo, Chicken Tikka Massala and Chicken Korma were ordered, along with a couple of plain naan and one Wild mushroom and truffle oil naan.\n\nThe food took about 15 minutes to come out of the kitchen, it then dawned on us both that they had not asked how hot we would like the curries, mmm, could be an issue, I like mine hot, but the wife likes hers very mild...Luckily for us, they were both mild, but then again (Indian food eaters are laughing) a Massala and a Korma really shouldn't be that spicy anyways.\n\nThe plain naan was good, the mushroom naan was very good, it actually made for a nice combination when eaten with the massala sauce.\n\nAs Frank S pointed out below, the flavours are very light and delicate, now, IMHO this is not a bad thing, especially when first being introduced to Indian food, the Korma was actually spot on, the massala needed a little more flavour to be just right.\n\nSo would I recommend Origin...Certainly, it is a decent Indian restaurant and even more so if you are just stepping into the wonderful world of Indian cuisine.\n\nAre there better in town, yes, are the worse in town oh yeah."

I would have given it four stars, but the prices are too high for the food you get.  These are strip prices, not some off-Strip mall prices.\n\nI had the southern Indian style diced lamb.  The seasoning was wonderful.  My friends had 1) the Origin India Kebab platter and 2) the lamb shank.  We also had one order of regular and one of garlic naan.  We also ordered fried papardam.  They were out of the fried so we got baked instead.  It was only 4:45 in the afternoon.  \n\nFor the three of us, the bill was just over $100.  We had cokes and an iced tea, no alcoholic drinks.  Since we had a Restaurant.com certificate, they added 20% service charge to the bill before the discount.  That's just too much for three people for what we got.\n\nThere are other places that are less pretentious that have good Indian food.  I'll go there in the future."

The food is tasty and spicy but not overly hot.  I liked the vegetable dishes more than the meat dishes, the sag paneer was outstanding, the lamb meatballs were delicious.  The naan bread was soft, fluffy, and warm the way it should be.  And the beetroot pudding was to die for.  The SO liked everything, although he thought the lamb dish (not the lamb meatballs) was just so-so.\nThe girl who served us, however, did not ask us if we wanted drinks.  She assumed we wanted water.  Before we left, my SO said \"thank you\" to her, and she did not say anything back at all.  She must have been in la-la land, but we thought it was weird.

Buuuuut, we left a bit disappointed. I guess this really only applies to the buffet ... which would really have 2 1/2 stars but gave them 3 assuming their regular menu is better. \n\nWe walked in, they seated us and said \"we have buffet, help yourself\" ... we thought that's all they were offering for lunch, we would have at least liked to see their lunch menu! It wasn't til they offered the menu to someone else that we became curious! haha We picked up a to go menu as we walked out and it sounds a lot better than what we experienced ... \n\nI guess being from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Indian buffets and this one fell short in my book. It was $14.99 and the selection was small. White rice, tandoori chicken, vegetable curry, chicken curry, punjabi curry (not sure what kind of meat it was, it was mushy), fish curry ... a potato soup (which was really salty), fruit salad and plain naan. I guess back home they just have so much more to choose from ... samosas, garlic naan, multiple curries etc. The food was ok ... just lacked variety and used to garlic naan. We ordered a side of samosas, good but would have preferred a thicker crust/wrap - it was more of an eggroll wrapper. \n\nNext time I'm in town and craving Indian food, I think I'll order off their regular menu or go somewhere else for a buffet."

Kind of bland and Americanized. Wanted to feel the intensity of the curry and taste the gamey-ness of the lamb meat. The kebab sampler was okay. The prawns in the sampler were delish (but you only get 2!!) but the rest of it was average. I have had better food at a food truck.

We only had one very small issue: my husband and daughter ordered Vindaloo and the waiter told them it was \"very spicy\". My husband is very familiar with the dish and told him he knew the level of spicy and it was okay. The waiter , Tony, took it upon himself to tell the chef that it should be toned down. He did the same with my Chicken Tikka Masala when I told him I wanted it medium, not mild. As a result we didn't get the same Indian experience that we looked forward to; spicy and delicious. \n\nTo those that think it is high priced have you ever considered that is more than just casual dining? Cloth napkins, change in plates and silverware between courses, etc...this is not casual dining.  It is a treat for us because it is not in our \"everyday\" price range, but I do think it is reasonably priced for the quality of food and level of service.\n\nWe will continue to choose Origin India as our go to for Indian food as well as recommend it to others.

Presentation and tons of flavor - not what we are used to seeing at Indian restaurants out here in Vegas.

Both had intense flavor and were SPICY (just the way we asked for it). \n\nFollowing appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!\n\nI also ordered a side of okra which is my favorite vegetarian dish. It was good but not as great as my dad makes :)\n\nThe chef served us a complimentary dessert which was a little piece of heaven. Saffron poached pear with vanilla ice cream and an orange panacotta. Out of this world!\n\nThe husband is not a fan of eating Indian food in restaurants since it's never up to our standards; however, he said we would be back to Origin India very soon!

About half of the group was new to Indian cuisine and I think that they were suitably impressed -- and satiated -- after the meal.  \n\nLocated right by the Hard Rock Cafe, about a mile from the Strip and super close to UNLV, this Indian eatery is on the pricier side, but the food quality and the interior decor reflect the spendiness well.  Warm rich wood tones and relaxing browns and beiges dominate the interior, with pops of colour and tastefully chosen wall art.  Can I say this place is \"modern Indian?\"   \n\nMy party chose a variety of dishes (paneer, lamb curry, lentils, okra, etc) and everyone was happy and stuffed.  Tasty sauces, pretty presentation.  Nothing I had was super spicy, which will make those spice-phobes happy.  (I didn't ask, but I'm sure you can request more/less spiciness.)  A few of the kiddos had room for dessert (aaaah....to be young again with unlimited stomach capacity and high metabolism....).  I did not.\n\nI'll check this place out again when I want to be close to the Strip, but not on it!"

It was crazy strong...I didn't eat before drinking it so I got really sleepy. Anyhow, we ordered the nan bread with mushroom. The nan were fresh and tasted okay.  We ordered two entrees, one seafood and one lamb. My fish was very boney, bland and hard to eat. My boyfriend got the lamb with some spices - it was not good at all. We had a really bad experience with the food. I'm not sure if we ordered the wrong things but ours were not good at all."

            "review": "OFFSITE DELISH\n\nTypically food at the LVCC is just terrible and it's always the same boring food every day like pizza and burgers. So I was excited when I saw that Orgin India had a location inside the South Hall Las Vegas Convention Center. I discovered it during setup and could hardly wait for them to open up on Monday, during the first day of the show. What I really loved was the different menu for all 4 days. No food kiosk here does that kind of variety or even changes their menu like that. \n\nThere were two options to order. For $13 you could get one meat choice & one veggie choice with rice, bread & sauces and for $16 you could add on two more items of meat & vegetable. \n\nOn day one, I ordered the Chicken Makhani, Lamb Rogan Josh, Tadka Dal and mixed vegetables. I must say that everything was delicious. My favorite was the lamb because it was so tender. It melted in my mouth. I really loved the sauce from the Chicken and I mixed it in with all of my white rice. The lentils in the Tadka Dal were really good too. After finishing my delicious lunch I only knew one thing, that I could not wait to eat lunch here again tomorrow. \n\nOn Day two, I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Karahi, Dal Makhani and Gajjar Aloo. The spices were all amazing again. But I thought I wasn't going to get lunch here because the line went down the convention show floor. Obviously word had spread about the amazing food here. The secret was now out. I thought about getting out of line but decided to stay. I must admit the staff served everyone fast and I had my food in no time at all. I was so happy that it all worked out. \n\nThen on Day three, I ordered the Chicken Curry, Lamb Tikka Masala, Sag Aloo and Chana Masala. Everything was amazing and such deep flavors. The potatoes and spinach in the Sag Aloo wouldn't win any awards for looking beautiful but for taste that dish was a perfect 10. Again the lamb was very tender like it had been all of the previous days I had eaten here. \n\nI was sad on Day Four because I could not make it over here to eat. I just hope that Orgin India continues making food at the LVCC for future trade shows. \n\nI also was lucky enough to get to meet the owner Raja. He was a very nice man and I also told him thanks for delivering delicious convention food. He told me that he had another food cart in the central hall. Wow he is a busy man. I also praised his choice of making different food every day. Raja suggested I try his mango yogurt drink called Mango Lassi. It was both refreshing and yummy, in fact I could have had this drink for a full meal. On my walk back to my booth a few people asked me where I got the bright orange color drink. It was a real attention grabber. \n\nI must also talk about the yogurt on the side. It is so good with fresh cucumber, carrot and spices. It is probably the best yogurt I've ever had. I was also amazed at the fresh herbs and spices they used to make the food. On two different days I found real cinnamon sticks inside the chicken dishes. There is nothing like fresh ingredients and it really shows in the taste. \n\nSo if you are lucky enough to be attending a show at the LVCC I would highly recommend that you find either one of their locations. It's not likely you find Indian food on the show floor of a convention center. I am happy to have found this place and to have met Raja. I wish him much success but I know he doesn't need it because he cares about his food and his customers. He is a very rich man in my book. I look forward to my next trade show in Vegas because I know where I'm eating my next lunch."

We wandered in here lost thinking we would find a cheap Indian joint, instead we were treated to fine dining. After being initially shocked at the prices, I ordered some Murg Bharti off the lunch menu which came with some naan, salad, and rice. The dish was good - creamy and flavorful. And the prices for the lunch items really weren't bad at around 13 dollars per. I got mad though because I ordered normal water and they brought us a 7 dollar bottle of whatever. Give it a try, just keep in mind this place is fancytime.\n\nEdit: I came here again for lunch May 07 and they had corrected the little water issue by offering both. I even got some extra papadums for free. The other items on the menu were just as good so I'm upgrading to 5 stars because I believe this place is the best you can find in vegas."

We were whisked away to our seats in a matter of minutes by a well dressed gentleman.  The setting was white linen and slightly formal, although we are in Vegas, and formal just doesn't cut the mustard in this town, it's typically blue jean Friday, every day of the week.\n\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive.  We ordered several appetizers, they were absolutely delicious, and had great eye appeal.  The portions at this restaurant fall are average, not to small, not too large.  Our main course was Lamb Masala and Buttery Chicken, again, both dishes were excellent and seasoned perfectly.\n\nThe restaurant environment, service and food are excellent, it's a tad pricey, but certainly a great dining experience."

Everything after that was kind of weird, to say the least.  Our waiter constantly kept trying to upsell us, which is good sometimes, but we were pretty set on what we wanted and he kept pushing us to change our mind for something more expensive (I eventually told him I'm not a fan of lamb nor any kind of meat because I don't eat meat and he stopped haha).  The food took a while to come out but it did and it was pretty good.  The samosas were a bit cold in the middle but I didn't bother to tell anyone because I was hungry.  I also remember the Indian tea to be really yummy so try that out the next time you're in there.\n\nAlso, for some reason, the staff were bickering at each other all night.  Our waiter was fighting with the bartender and the bartender was telling the hostess to tell the waiter to go away and leave him alone etc, etc.  I not sure what the bustle was all about but it kept getting worse and guess what?  The waiter forgot about us.  A younger dude (maybe a manager? owner?) kept coming over while we ate to ask if everything was ok as well.  I just nodded and continued to eat because after awhile because I didn't want to state the obvious and tell him about the problem between the staff or the samosas.\n\nFinally, we were ready to leave and I called for the check.  At this point, the manager (?) was gone and we had to wait on our waiter.  It took a little bit because he went to the back for something and waited on some people coming into the restaurant.  I thought that was kind of odd.. he should have just given me my check and I could've signed it and been on my way.  But, Origin India does it different.  If you have a card (credit or debit) they have you use their CC machine at the table.  It was a bit awkward because it gives you option to manually put in a tip but I pressed okay and it automatically set me up for an 18% tip.  Now, my experience was nowhere near warranting an 18% tip but THE WAITER WAS STANDING RIGHT ABOVE ME waiting for me to press okay.  I felt weird asking how to go back on my tip for a more suitable tip so I just pressed okay and off the waiter went.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting experience.  I hope the waiter became a little happier with my generous tip.  Not sure how I feel about coming back to this place but if I do, I know how not to get tricked into a 18% tip!"

Besides the lunch buffet which is amazing, I recommend trying some of their unique specialties which one would rarely see on an Indian buffet... Most of my Indian eating experiences have only been buffets until now... The chef recommend som amazing items.... On the section of the menu labeled, South Indian menu, there is an amazing crepe made from lentils, it has different choices for fillings, but it is a must try... I think it's called, dosa... Try it let me know what you think... It is vegan and gluten free as are many things on the menu... Atmosphere is great.... Bring a party here... Could get busy so call ahead... I bet the chef tasting menu is the way to go dinner time!!!"

I don't know why it's getting such a bad rap but here's my experience.\n\nIt's a cozy restaurant with the perfect amount of lighting for a date, which I took my wife.  They have a nice wine selection list.  The service was spot on, we were attended to just the right amount.  \n\nI ordered the spicy lamb curry... and let me tell you, the lamb was so perfectly cooked that it literally fell apart in my mouth and the flavors and textures could not have been better.  I also ordered the lemon rice which if you like rice at all, it's beyond amazing.  Lemon rice + spicy lamb curry = foodgasm. \n\nThere was only one hiccup.  I like spicy food, like biting into a jalapeno hot so I did have to send it back for the chef to add a little more kick.  But that's just my personal preference.\n\nThe only thing that I didn't like is that rice or bread did not come with the entrees.  With that being said, the food was so phenomenal that it's getting five stars from me.  also my wife had some eggplant dish that I tasted and it was fantastic as well."

It's NOT typical Indian, which is one reason I like it so much. It's a bit more expensive than the rest, but it's worth it.\n\nYesterday Origin India began offering a buffet brunch. Saturdays and Sundays only, from 10am until 3pm, $14.95 per person. I went today, the 2nd day the brunch has been offered. This is, hands down, the best Indian+ buffet I have had in this town. It's on a gourmet level, the way the dishes were prepared. Not too heavy, wonderful spicing, divine. Again, UNUSUAL stuff in this buffet. I had so many favorites. I'm only sad it's not a DAILY buffet!"

First off, for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting. It's similar to a side salad you get at McDonalds (yes, this exists). It even had shredded cheddar cheese on top. I'll repeat this. CHEDDAR CHEESE and chicken tikka. Together. WHY? To boot, the tomatoes were wilted, the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and I would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me. So, know this going in, they can't even make a salad right... and it costs over ten dollars.  \n\nThe rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad. The Chana Masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb. \n\nMy advice? Grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home. Better yet, find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in. NEXT!"

Most seem to lie in the Tropicana/Paradise area of town.  We tried many of the hole-in-wall lower star restaurants first with not much liking, and now we're trying some of the 4-5 star selections.  Origin India is our third 4-star restaurant to try this week.  We feel our results are better if we compare all of them fairly close together.  We ate here today at about 4pm for dinner service.\n\nThings we are noticing that seem in common for the India restaurants is most service is pretty slow and most food is served lukewarm.  We believe this is a cultural thing with newer restaurants that have opened in Vegas, while the ones that have been here for a long while seem to be Americanizing with better service and hotter temperatures for served food.  But our selections are based on the taste of the food and at least moderate service.\n\nAMBIANCE:  The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice.  The room was large and filled with tables but not crowded together.  A large television set was showing India music videos but it was turned way down so as not to disturb diners.  The tables are set up to show off a little elegance with cloth napkins.  It looks extravagant but yet the prices are not extravagant.  We arrived at 4pm and it was 103 degrees outside, yet inside it was very cool.\n\nSERVICE:  I prefer service with a smile.  It's nice when it looks like the workers enjoy their place of business.  Our hostess/waitress smiled and was very pleasant.  Our waiter/check bringer didn't smile but did provide refills in a timely manner.  Surprisingly, the food was served quickly compared to our other experiences where it took over thirty minutes to receive the first of several dishes.  Our food came out at the same time along with the appetizer.  And the food was a little better than warm, certainly not lukewarm as we usually expect and receive it.  It wasn't hot but it was much warmer than we've been receiving it in other India restaurants.\n\nFOOD:  For drinks we had water and tea.  I asked about flavored teas but was told they only had regular ice tea.  The tea was fresh and good.  We ordered Keema Nan ($4.95) which is naan bread stuffed with ground lamb.  Sorta like a flat bread but the lamb was inside the bread.  Delicious!  I ordered Chicken Karahi ($15) listed under chef's specialty low spice heat which is boneless chicken stir fried with bell peppers and onions with a thick tomato paste-like sauce.  My son ordered Lahori Goat Korma ($15) high spice heat which is goat braised in a spicy ginger-garlic sauce and finished with fried onions and yogurt.  The food was served family style filling two five inch round bowls about three inches deep, to over flowing.  The Chicken Karahi was delicious, only mildly spiced just as I asked and had a surprising amount of meat in it compared to most orders we've requested.  The Lahori Goat was bland.  We tasted neither ginger or garlic.  It was laced with small bone pieces which made it difficult to eat, and although it was selected for top spiciness, my chicken was spicier than it.  Also the Goat did not come with fried onions or yogurt.  Although I doubt that would have helped the dish.\n\nThe total for the meal was just over $28 (not including tip) since we used an Entertainment Book coupon for $15 off.  So the prices were good, but the food was hit and miss.  Plus they did not offer \"Buttered Chicken\" which I was hoping to try."

I know what's good, what's not so good. Years ago (like 5), I went to Origin India and was blown away by the food. It set the bar for Indian food in Las Vegas. \n\nI took my daughters (7 years old) to Origin India a few weeks ago. Figured it's time they're exposed to their peoples' food. The place still looks the same (which is quite nice, actually). The gentleman who waited on us was very friendly. He even brought my daughters out free Mango Lassi's. The lassi's were delicious. Reminded me exactly of those served in my parents' place in LA (now long gone). \n\nFor the kiddos, I ordered plain Naan, tandoori chicken and plain rice. For myself, the vegetable biryani and lamb vindaloo (my favorite dish in the world when done right). And a Kingfisher, which if you haven't tried it, it's a fantastic beer!\n\nOverall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the food. \n\nThe naan seemed flatter than it should be but tasted good. The tandoori chicken was a little on the dry side. Not unlike that you'd find at an Indian food buffet. \n\nThe vegetable biryani was a complete disappointment: mushy rice, too wet, soft and flavorless (probably canned) vegetables. \n\nThe lamb vindaloo was not good. It kind of tasted like vindaloo but mostly didn't. It's hard to explain but the flavors just didn't seem developed enough. You could tell there were spices and flavors in there but they just weren't coming through. The funny thing is, when I took the leftovers out of the fridge to eat the next day, the sauce tasted a 100 times better. I'm guessing the vindaloo sauce wasn't allowed to mix and marry for some time like it needs before being served. \n\nDespite really friendly service, we won't be back."

The chef recommended the long-cooked lamb shank,which none of us had, but we saw it as a nearby table and it looked fork-fall-apart. Also had the chef's version of eggplant bharta, which they call \"pressed eggplant\" as a side. It was a little too hot, probably my fault because I asked for spicy. All told, a wonderful value.

A visit today was the final nail in the coffin for my girlfriend and I, who both decided we'd probably not be coming back much anymore.\n\nLet me get this out of the way: the food is still good, generally, the atmosphere is upscale-but-comfortable, and the service is professional and courteous. But ... \n\nThe menu has been changed recently, forgoing names of dishes for lengthy descriptions that make finding what you want a challenge. It seems like a deliberate effort to Americanize/fancy-up further the menu. As well, the leaning toward the gourmet seems to have pushed up the prices yet again, as the restaurant offers nuanced, fusion fare beyond Indian-spawned dishes. The gastronomical experiments may please foodies. The deviations from the traditional do not please this eater, however.\n\nOne of our favorite items at Origin, regardless of anything else, has always been the vegetable samosa, an appetizer staple. But on this recent visit, the restaurant's traditional purse-shaped, doughy treats were replaced with thin, triangular samosas, similar to what Trader Joe's sells frozen, only not as good.\n\nThe service was slow (though it always seems to be slow at Indian restaurants for some reason, so that may just be a cultural difference in pacing), but it took extra long to get things like drink refills, despite a relatively calm lunch time, and when we presented a gift card to pay for part of the meal, it took about 10 minutes and two people to figure out how to get it to work.\n\nWhile, as I said, the food, and slowness aside, the service were both good, the price point has become too high for a casual meal, and the change in samosas? Unforgivable. For us, at least."

Yes, you do pay for rice and bread but in Vegas, where it seems good Indian food is scarce, it's worth it for us. We'll be back."

There  were maybe 2-3 other tables the whole time, which is sad because it's really nice inside. \n\nWe ordered the lamb skewers for an app, and then I ordered the HYDERABADI CHICKEN and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Mukhani. Our server brought us an app but it wasn't the lamb and we didn't know until after we ate it. It was this spicy chicken and apparently the server accidentally sent it to the wrong table. They were super nice and told us to enjoy it and then they brought our lamp app out. The lamb was actually lamb patties, not skewers, and it was just ok. The chicken app we got on accident was delicious but very spicy.\n\nBoth of our entrees were simply chicken in a curry-type broth and then we got a side of rice. My entr\u00e9e tasted exactly like this Thai curry that I make at home. LOL. I LOVED it! Honestly, my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e tasted very similar as well, with less of a coconut taste. We were stuffed by this point since we had two appetizers, so we had a lot left over to take home. \n\nThe service was good and we got our food fast. It's a fun little date spot."

There were only a very few items in the buffet and there is a big sign  \"Use bowls only for dessert\" near the buffet. The service was bad. I looked around for the dessert out of curiosity and found only one very cold item and that is just Kheer and that's the only ONE item in the dessert.  OK, I started taking the curries and asked for Naan. It took 20 mts to get the Naan and by that time we were almost done with eating. Besides, to our surprise, we saw only 4 small pieces cut out of one plain Naan and five of us had to eat. I called the server and asked for Garlic Naan who responded immediately that it has to be ordered from the menu and it's not part of the buffet. With lots of frustration and agony, I gave the card for the check. The cunning staff had a portable credit card scanner who stood next to me to process the card. The scanner displayed tips options with 21%, 18% and other adding more fuel to my anger. What a crap... Normally I am generous in giving tips. And for this lousy buffet and egregious service, they had to give money back. This restaurant has to be banned."

I suppose consistency is important, but the restaurant is only 2 years old, and they've gone through a number of adjustments which may account for the fluctuations in quality. All I can speak to is what I ate, which was superb -- the best Indian I've had in Las Vegas, everything tasted fresh and not too heavy, like some Indian food. I suppose it helps that I was dining with one of the owners, who talked to me about the idea behind the restaurant: to mimic the Indian restaurants in England (2 of which they own) and use fresh, high-quality organic ingredients. She'd kinda hyped it up so much that I was dubious until the food came and spoke for itself. \n\nWe had some mussels seasoned with Indian spices and coconut milk. I don't usually like mussels, but these were delectable. Everything else surpassed expectations. Naan was piping hot, doughy, and fresh out of the oven. Chicken makhani, the crowd favorite, pleased my palate like a good Indian curry should. The garlic shrimp curry, fish kabob, and lamb curry were equally fantastic. Kinda expensive, but helps when you're not paying! Also very dark inside, but who needs to see when the food is so kick ass?"

When pointed it out they said that's the standard quantity so we ordered more Raita, no Problem still. Ordered some desserts but nothing great there as well. Gajar Halwa was too sweet and luke warm, Ras Malai pieces were broken (happens if they are not fresh) and was not cold as its supposed to be. When the bill came it had few (4-5) items we didn't order. Thankfully my buddy caught it and when he pointed out to the manager he was not apologetic at all and behaved as if he is doing us a favor by correcting his mistake.  \n\nAnyway next day we saw a deal on Groupon next day so we thought lets give it another shot and try their Buffet.  We were a big group so bought two different coupons and they said one coupon per table. We offered to sit on two different tables but the waiter smiled and said it's ok and pointed us to a big table.The spread was good but the food was again OK and very heavy, one positive was that they brought fresh Nans to the table which were soft.  When the waiter got us the bill they again said that they can't accept two coupons. We called the manager and he said \"I am not sure what the waiter said but I see you sitting on one table\" . I don't mind these small things usually but its the attitude that sucks, forget about accepting the coupon there was no apology in case the waiter created the confusion. This is the level of service when they saw us second time in two days .\n\nBottom line didn't feel that the management/ staff is courteous and and the food tastes edible but is pretty greasy and heavy. May be try another Indian restaurant next time."

We've been to Tamba in the past for buffet and it was ok.  We were greeted warmly when we arrived by a well dressed host for a Friday night dinner.  We were expecting another hole-in-the-wall join but to our surprise, the ambiance was fantastic.  Dimly lit, very elegant.  Apparently the restaurant is modeled after their restaurants in London.  I played it safe with a Chicken Tikka Masala dish.  They got this right, and MORE.  I literally licked my plate clean because the sauce was so delicious.   It was that good.  The bartender, the waitress, the host, AND even the chef took a moment to stop by at our table throughout the evening to check in on us.  I was really impressed by the service.  It  is so uncommon to see, especially at an Indian restaurant.  The customers at the time of our visit were a diverse group of people, with an Indian family at the large round table in the corner.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place to those who are visiting Las Vegas and love Indian food.  Origin India is clearly in the running for best Indian cuisine in Las Vegas.

Compared to the more rustic Indian restaurants I've encountered, I would say the food here is bland. But if I had no point of reference from which to stake a comparison, I'd say the food is tastefully seasoned.\n\nI started with the grilled paneer tikka appetizer: a mildly seasoned tower of fresh cheese. I loved getting little flashes of char from the grill on my tongue. The tikka sauce was sparingly placed on the plate. It was satisfying yet light, and also not terribly flavorful. I had the chicken tikka makhani as my main course. Paired with the garlic naan, it turned out to be tasty, but once again lacked any real punch.\n\nThe dining atmosphere is quiet and elegant with a pleasantly minimalistic decor. I would eat here again. The menu options are unique and I'd like to explore them a little further. However, I left the restaurant feeling slightly ambivalent about the food. Maybe one of these days I'll drop back in: after I've forgotten how unmemorable it was."

I didn't like the cheap decorations and hanging fake candles.  The chair and table combination made me feel like the table was at my throat.  \nOnce we were seated it took a unreasonable length of time to get water much less drink service.  Water was finally served at the time they took our order. Which was probably about 30 minutes after our arrival.  Our order was taken by a waiter who insisted there portions were very \"generous.\" \n\nThe presentation of the appetizers was very nice but not very high on the taste factor.  I can't remember what it was that I had ordered.  Our main curse arrived in a series of small bowls.  The rice and naan were both tasty but the portions were disappointing.  Rice and naan are cheap to make and shouldn't be given out so limitedly.  I again can't remember exactly what I ordered but the food overall was highly disappointing.  The only item I can remember eating because it was probably the best of all 6 different dishes we ordered was the curried chicken.  While better than anything else we had it was still not great.\n\nAfter dinner was served is when things really went down hill.  Our server seemed to have died.  Everyone at the table ran out of water about half way through dinner and never got a refill.  It took another hour to get the bill during witch time the buser passed our table repeatedly with the water pitcher and ignored us as we tried to wave him down.  Even with money in hand trying to pay the bill we were ignored for sometime.  I was very please to walk out of Origins 2.5 hours later, not because I was satisfied but because I hated every minute I spent in the place.\n\nOn one final note they were not busy this night.  Our table was one of about 6 with patrons.  The food was instantly forgettable and the price was way to high.  Hands down worst service in Las Vegas.  I will not return to Origin ever again."

Well... Brace for it.. It was horrible!!!! \n\nFirstly, the decor left alot to be desired. If your going to be in the restaurant business in Vegas, you really have to great decor, something visually appealing. Trust me the photos posted on the website make it seem like its nice...its not. After visiting many restaurants on the Strip, this one had me thinking \" wow..this looks plain\". Even though its off the strip, I have seen mom and pop shops that look better than this, however I was still interested to see how the food was.. \n\nThe dishes we ordered were as follows: New Zealand lamb shank..veggie biryani..punjabi khadi..paneer tikka masala. The best of all these was the Lamb Shank..the meat was quite tender but the curry felt like it was just warmed up, didn't taste fresh at all. The veggie biryani was kinda sticky, not very flavorful. The punjabi khadi was horrible! It was so salty we had to send it back, after the waiter tasted it himself he agreed, the salt was overkill. Paneer tikka masala was your standard fare..nothing stood out. I would have to think that maybe the owners think they can get away with serving sub par indian food, since Im sure this restaurant doesn't get many people of indian origin visiting. \n\nSo to sum it up, I have got to believe that Vegas has better indian food than this place. I'm quite shocked at all the positive reviews from some people! Maybe next time I will go to Gaylord Indian Restaurant at Rio."

So I started to do take-out and then even the take-out was just a joke. \n\nSo that's why I will not come back to your establishment which really sucks for me because I think the food is terrific! \n\nOne note I will give, is one of the many times visiting, I attempted to use an opentable check, which is just like a travelers check. Which you are supposed to accept since you are on opentable.com\nThe servers and supervisor that night had no idea what it was and refused to take it. That was one of my many disappointing trips in.

We had 4 dishes, 2 appetizers and 5 drinks total. \n\nWe had  -\n\n3 beers\n1 wine\n1 Martini\nStuffed mushroom - Very weird for me. It was a very blunt taste of curry, yogurt and a uncooked mushroom that was breaded.\nSaag Paneer - Very good\nShrimp Tikka Masala - Sauce was very tasty and rich. \nLamb Rogan Josh - The sauce was okay. I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.\nChicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish. It came out and the sauce didn't taste like it normally would for chicken mukhani. It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. \nLamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. \n\nOverall - the service was not good. It took us over an hour to get all of our food. Mainly because the waiter was not coming around to ask if we were ready to order. It was not busy, maybe 5-6 tables total. On Friday nights at 7, it's packed at a lot of places. So, that could be a sign if they're not busy. \nAgain, the food was good - not amazing for a pricier menu. The location and the building itself does not call for higher prices. Neither does the service."

            "review": "To continue with my exploration of Indian lunch buffets around town, I invited a friend from UNLV to check out Origin India's version.  My experience at Origin India prior was limited to one visit for dinner years ago which I was completely unimpressed with the flavors (or lack thereof) that I experienced then, but I was willing to give it another shot due to my having experienced much more Indian fare since then (I pretty much guessed what I wanted on that visit), and plus my Currygeous Indian Eats list here on Yelp demanded it!   Pro tip: it never hurts to plug your own lists or reviews within other reviews.\n\nUpon entering, the dining room looked as nice as a I remembered it, and there were only a few other tables with diners which was a stark contrast to what I'm used to at Mt Everest or Mint.  Origin's buffet offering is new, so perhaps this will change over time.   In addition to less customers, another big difference was in the options of food.  I don't know exact numbers and maybe it was just perception, but it seemed like Origin had quite fewer dishes available than Everest or Mint.  \n\nI've adopted a \"one plate\" rule with Mt Everest and Mint due to severely overstuffing myself each time if I don't, but Origin's plates are decidedly smaller so I allowed myself one return visit to the food offerings on this occasion (I'll use any excuse to eat more).  On my first plate I had some rice, chili mint chicken, some potato dish, goat curry, and a dish made mostly of peas.  I thought the flavors were quite nice on each one, but particularly was fond of the chili mint chicken.  It had quite a kick to it which I enjoyed and the chunks of chicken were nice and juicy, and this was all while having scooped out the last of what was in the tray in the buffet line.   This brings me to one of the issues I had: 15 minutes after originally going up for the first plate, I went back up and the chili mint chicken had still yet to be refilled.  Now normally in a buffet filled with a plethora of offerings, one item missing wouldn't be so bad, but with the shorter list of options and what is clearly one of the more popular items, I thought it was inexcusable it wasn't constantly being filled.  In fact, I didn't see a lot of freshening up of the options while I was there.   One could argue that due to the lack of customers perhaps not many of them needed more, but it would have pleased me much more to know that I was likely to be eating freshly prepared food than ones that could have been sitting out for some time.  I'm willing to excuse this a little given that they're new to the buffet game, so hopefully this improves over time.   \n\nMy 2nd plate since there wasn't any chili mint chicken to add to it ended up being fairly sparse with just some more rice and a couple curry options I hadn't gotten to try originally.  They don't have any sort of helpful guides on the dish name cards to let you know which ones are vegan/vegetarian friendly so proceed with caution!\n\nIt was a satisfying meal, and service was good with fresh hot naan brought out a few times and drinks refilled at a dizzying speed.  Price was about average (I think, to be honest I didn't pay much attention).  Ultimately though it's impossible for me to not compare it to Mt Everest and Mint for their as of now superior lunch buffet options.  Less options and less constant refills of those options along the line will lead to less visits from me to Origin."

The decor is nice a little bit on the poncy side for an indian but well whatever floats their boat right? \n\nSo we ordered the usual beers (Cobra and Kingfisher) and had a mild heartattack at the cost of a small beer...ok i unerstand that this stuff is shipped from India and all that, but i can buy the same beer at Lees for cheaper...well the resturant charges us $6.00 (domestic was $4 and other imported beer like corona was $5) So we supped our beers very slowly! \n\nAs always you get a \"freebie\" plate of popadoms and chutneys, their chutney selection was mint and some sort of brown sauce...still not too sure what was in that one....but we were very disapointed not to find the usual onion salad and mango chutney in the selection!\n\nThe menu is quite limited, you won't find the standard tikka masala, rogan josh, or aloo gobi here my friends. The menu seems to be aimed more towards the veggy market, and seeing as the whole point of curry was a strong sauce to over power the taste of rotten meat (it's true check your history books...look for some time around the British Raj!) the meat side was very limited...a bit of chicken, prawn, fish and lamb.  \n\nAll of the main dishes come served with rice, salad, naan and a veggy side dish.....which no matter what you choose turns up as yellow or black lentils!!! The curry is quite a small portion and comes set on your plate (there's no sharing here!) the rice was just plain white...what happened to the balsamic i hear you cry? The salad was mainly red pepper (3 slices) and cucumber (4 slices) on a warm lettuce leaf...yum appetising *blee* \n\nOn our table we ordered the Safed murg korma  (which tasted like Cambells chicken soup), the Murg makhani (which actually wasn't too bad as long as you ask for it hot!) and the Aloo nazakat (which looked and i'm positive it had the same texture of baby sick!) \n\nThe total cost of the meal was $120, that was made up of  the 5 beers and 4 curries; all in all i believe it was over priced with tiny portions!\n\nSadly it looks like i'll have a bit of a long wait (or a 10 hour plane ride) for my next curry!!"

Came here as part of a group of seven, which is perfect for this type of restaurant, because we were able to order a bunch of dishes and try a little of each.\n \nWe started with the onion bhajis and Bombay bhelpurri. The latter is puffed rice mixed with onions and tomatoes in a tamarind sauce. I'd never tried this dish before and it was very tasty. The puffed rice gave it an interesting texture different from most dishes you typically find in an Indian restaurant.\n\nFor our mains, we shared the the lamb vindaloo, chana masala (chickpea curry), Rajastani paneer and southern grilled fish. The fish was a bit disappointing (lacklustre and slightly overcooked) but the other three dishes were excellent. I'm not a huge lamb fan so my favourites were the chana masala (very spicy and flavourful) and most of all the Rajastani paneer. This was a paneer (Indian cheese) dish in a carrot-based sauce that also contained bell peppers and cashew paste. Again, I had never tried this particular type of paneer before, but I absolutely loved it and will definitely keep an eye out for it in Indian restaurants in my 'hood. It was rich, creamy and delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere was I suppose what you would expect in an Indian restaurant (Indian-style decor but with a lot of modern touches), with the exception that instead of Indian music, they were playing random pop music. A little out of place with the atmosphere I thought, at least until later in the evening when it becomes more of a \"bar\" atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the service was very good and we had a great experience here. It's located a short cab ride from the strip but more than worth a return trip if I'm looking for good Indian food in Las Vegas."

At Origin India, the decor is simple and chic with Hyderabad written all over it. Contrary to the popular Indian buffet, Origin India offers an a la carte menu. \n\nDishes on the left side of the menu with \"Traditional Dishes Served Family Style\" come without rice. Dishes on the right side of the menu under \"Entrees\" come with rice. I recommend ordering from the left side, then getting a side of rice. It comes out economically more friendly and portions, according to the server, are equivalent.\n\nIF you're an herbivore, they're vegetarian-friendly and will have provided you with (V) next to any items that are vegetarian. They also have a vegetarian menu slipped in the middle for your green delight. \n\nTo the food...\n\nHome-style chicken curry scented with kaffir lime leaves and smooth onion tomato sauce: I was curry-ous to see how this dish would turn out. My curry hopes were curtailed and there was much more tomato flavor than I would have hoped for. The density was just right, perfect for dipping naan, and if one enjoys tomato sauce with naan, one should order this dish. I, for one, was still curry-ous afterwards.\n\nThey have an amazing selection of naan. Their naan is very aromatic with the oven's flavor baked right in. I ordered the\n\nCheese and Chilli Naan: great oven-baked flavor, very cheesy and went well with the tomatoey curry. Fluffiness with stretchy paneer... yum\n\nDal Makhani: black Urad lentils cooked with garlic, butter and cream; these bad boys were so delicious, spiced just right with a savory lingering flavor even after you've swallowed. This was on the Vegetarian menu, but we got it as a side, so it was only $7. On the bill, it showed up only as $6. Score! Every dollar saved is another dollar to eat some more!\n\nI intertwined my meal with a tasty\n\nMango Lassi: smooth and frothy yogurt with natural mango flavor to tantalize my tongue.\n\nAs tasty as this drink was, the next dish I had which is the\n\nOven-baked baby eggplant in Hyderabadi sesame, peanut sauce tempered with curry leaves, mustard seeds and whole red chillies: but it was so disappointing. I only tasted sesame seeds and peanut sauce, but they must have forgotten the pinches of salt.\n\nThis dish was made up for with the Vermicelli Pannacotta. Three squares of vermicelli creme with lychee jelly... like something someone would think to make on \"Chopped.\"\n\nFood was 3.5 stars. Ambience was 5. Service was 4. Try this place at least once. I'll be back for a third time."

The vindaloo was not on the menu, but the server said that they still served it.  If was definitely not the dish that I had last time i was here.  The spice wasn't right and I had to add a ton of green chiles to get it right.  Charging for rice must be a Vegas thing.  One of the big drawbacks was the server charging card tableside.  It was just plain awkward."

I ordered the Saag Paneer and a vegetarian curry dish(sorry folks, the name of the dish eludes me) along with a Naan that had raisins and apricots in it. This meal was easily the best meal I had in Las Vegas on this trip! The food tasted amazing and I always bypassed on sweeter Naan before in the past but no longer! It was delicious! I did take out and met up with Steve at the hotel. The service was fast and friendly! I will make a point to seek this place out next time I am in town!"

Our waiter even remembered me from the last time I was in.\n As far as what to order here, I love the stuffed nan (get a side of Riata and chutney for dippins), and the eggplant with cashew sauce(oh my heaven), and the lentils are so fragrant. The house merlot wasn't bad either at $6 a glass. Overall, it does add up and gets a bit expensive however its not a cafe style place its a nice sit down place.\nI also love their hours 11am to 11:30 pm.\nwww.originindiarestaurant.com"

I was most looking forward to the vegetable nilgiri, as I'd never had an Indian green curry, but it turned out to be on the bland side, even though I'd asked for medium hot. In fact, there was very little spiciness to any of our dishes. I also had the yellow dahl, which was fine but also not terribly spicy. My accomplice for the weekend said the same about her chicken makhani (Origin's version of chicken tikka masala), but we both loved her mango beverage, which turned out to the highlight of an otherwise uneventful meal. \n\nI would use this place as an Indian back-up if the curry craving ever hit, or to introduce a curry neophyte to the cuisine, as it's a rather calm and beautiful decor."

I had last visited Origin India that long ago prior to moving to Vegas, and I had left disgruntled by overpriced, undersized Indian dishes that weren't particularly notable. We were lured back in by the Yelp Deal, and I am happy we decided to give Origin a second chance. Even though the menu is still a bit pricey, the dishes we had were well-executed and flavorful. \n\nMy advice is to stick to the traditional vegetarian dishes, as at $11 they are the best value, and the servings come in a big, deep bowl. You can also get a half-serving, which is not skimpy either. We ordered the saag paneer, yellow dal and a mixed vegetable curry. Both the saag and the yellow dal were complex, savory and non-stop delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the mixed vegetable curry, but my husband was. Our first order of roti hardened quickly, but the second order was okay. The flavor of our dishes was definitely the standout of our experience. \n\nWithout our Yelp Deal, we could have likely had a decent amount of food for rather affordable, as two vegetarian dishes is more than enough. However, the specialty dishes are substantially more expensive between $20-$25. And, our service was spotty. When we showed up, the lights were still bright, and we felt as if were in a cafeteria. Then, we waited for a long time to be greeted by our server, even though there were staff joking around behind the bar. Once our server arrived, she was very kind, but our water ran dry. Plus, our order was messed up. They corrected it quickly and let us keep the errant dish, but for an environment this nice with these prices, I would expect a higher level of service and attention to detail.\n\nAs for the errant dish, it was black dal, and it wasn't as good as the yellow, but we enjoyed it as a snack the day after!\n\nI definitely think this is an improved Origin India, and with the Yelp Deal and an extra \"oops\" dish, we definitely left satisfied."

Tai Mahal premium beer is a must get, it is refreshing and it makes you feel like you are sipping on champagne. Order the nan/garlic nan paired with red curry, lamb with rice and the shrimp Molly. The nan with curry exactly what I expected, perfection! The lamb with rice in a bowl was tasty the lamb was tender and was full of flavors. Finally my main entree the shrimp Molly, it is out of this world and it would rock your taste buds. Thank you Goldie (manager) and your staff. Superb!"

I'm not up on my Indian food names, but I can tell you that we got a lamb dish, a chicken dish, a potato and spinach dish and lots of lentils and naan.  They were all quite tasty though the lamb dish was no where near being as spicy as we requested.  \n\nFor the price, I thought the food was just so-so, but I'll give it an extra star for being the \"Best in Las Vegas.\"  The wines were reasonably priced.  The waiter could NOT grasp the concept that we wanted to share everything, which made ordering overly complicated.  \n\nA DJ started playing right when we got there and though the music was pretty cool (techno Indian music and live bongo drums...seriously, it was pretty cool), it was pretty loud and we had to scream and repeat ourselves to uphold our conversation.\n\nOverall a good place, but I can't wait to get some SF dive Indian food."

But if you are looking for authentic Indian food stay away from Origin India. I ordered Makhni (Butter) Chicken (medium to spicy) which is a common dish at Indian restaurants but what I received was bland Cream of Tomato Soup with pieces of chicken. After sending it back for the chef to make it spicier I got my dish back with green chilies on it, again which isn't Makhni Chicken. The waiter took my food away without even asking why I hadn't eaten it or if I would like it to go and just handed me the bill. Overall just a bad restaurant and service."

One look at the menu and you encounter a few familiar names but then some odd spellings from your traditional Indian restaurant.  \n\nKali Mirch Ka Jhinga (Pepper Shrimp) is a dish I have never encountered before.  It was good but I an still trying to figure out if the stir-fried dish served over green papaya noodles is indicative to Pakistan or some chef's fusion creation. I had never seen Sweet Potato salad a blend of masala and plum chutney flavors. There are tasting menus for 2 or more people.  \n\n\nThe decor and design of this restaurant  is very upscale. The prices for entrees are a bit more than I am used to paying. Quite a few over $20 dishes. The location and outside door is much better than the only other Indian restaurant I have been to in Vegas.  I'll eat here again but I had to budget for it."

Not knowing what to expect, we were beyond pleasantly surprised - the ambiance is not that of your usual stuffy Indian restaurant (I know, I have so much faith in my people). Rather it was uncluttered and tastefully decorated, combining both traditional elements with avante-garde accents... clay colored walls and archways reminiscent of Delhi's Red Fort, which were offset by modern touches such as comfortable brown leather chairs and sleek wooden tables. \n\nThe menu echoed the mix of tradition and contemporary, including staples like samosas and Rogan Josh, but was also had unique offerings such as Atlantic black cod and Grilled Canadian rock lobster. Everything we ate was delightful and the service was great too.\n\nThe distinguishing nature of this establishment is a testament to its founders, an England-based restaurateur couple that modeled Origin based on their industry experiences in the UK (which is well-known for their Indian cuisine)."

            "review": "Tried this place on a Saturday night in Vegas recently. Surprisingly the whole place was empty at peak time. There were lot of customers in other restaurants in the same strip mall, so its not as if this place was unique. \nWe entered and we were immediately impressed by the decor and ambiance. They also had some nice music playing and flattering lighting. \nThe restaurant may be struggling as they had a Groupon deal running when we went there and also have a Yelp $15 for 20 running right now.  The issue could be with their pricing. The entrees were about $15+ for vegetarian and $20+ for Non-vegetarian. Typically, either bread or rice is included with entrees, but here it was separate. So its like they have 'on the strip' prices for an off the strip restaurant with less value. Nevertheless, we liked the food, service and ambiance. The server/host was welcoming, he made it clear from the beginning that he can only accept one Groupon per table (we had 2) which is a fair policy. Despite applying the deal, there was no difference in service. We ordered the tadka daal, aloo paratha and some chilli paneer. Out of which, I would rate chilli paneer the lowest - as it tasted more indo chinese and was super sweet. The daal was really nice and aloo paratha was fresh and not frozen crap. Our friends tried the chicken and lamb and also liked it. Our Indian food standards are pretty low coming from Austin, TX - but we had just returned from India so the taste of amazing Indian food was fresh in our minds. In the end, the servers even offered to pack our left overs for us, which was a nice gesture. No hassles with billing or the check. All in all, if you crave Indian - go for it."

For dessert we ordered the Poached Pear with ice cream...I've never had a poached pear before and man, I've been missing out! It was very good and the ice cream was a nice addition.
