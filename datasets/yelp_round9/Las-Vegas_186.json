StripSteak is so good. Orgasmically good.\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere is upscale and chic. Prices are high, but it's Vegas, what do you expect? The food and the experience are well worth the price. If you stay at Mandalay Bay, make sure that your room reservation comes with a resort credit. Then you can spend it all on a fabulous dinner at StripSteak. You will be so happy that you did."

The duck fat fries are a must, people.  Also, the burratta salad was fresh and delicious, and my boyfriend's rib cap steak was incredible.  He said that it was one of the BEST steaks he's ever had in his entire life.  Coming from a 32 year old extreme carnivore, that's pretty substantial.  Also, my lamb chops were scrumptious as well.\n\nIn addition, the bill ended up not being ridiculously high as we anticipated.  I'd say Strip Steak rivals N9NE in terms of the type of ambiance and crowd they are attempting to attract.  Go to Strip Steak for a quieter, romantic and more upscale meal.  \n\nThis delicious, satisfying meal was exactly what I needed after almost killing myself with alcohol poisoning a couple nights before.  I'll be back."

The menu was extensive in its selection of steak. There were a great variety of types of meat from T-bone to Kobe cap. We ordered the lobster salad w/ grapefruit vinaigrette. It had a slight tanginess to the sweet fresh lobster. I ordered the diver scallops w/ cajun spice--which actually didn't wow me at all. It basically was grilled scallops w/ lemon for $40.  My boyfriend ordred 18 oz. bone-in rib eye which was a hearty portion! I actually liked his steak a lot more than my own scallops. We also ordered the Mac & Cheese in truffle oil and mushrooms. Both of which were amazingly good and I would recommend that you order it w/ your meat! The truffle oil gave the Mac & Cheese a distinct taste that separated it from your typical American/Cheddar mac & cheese. \n\nHonestly, I felt like the food was good here, but it's definitely too expensive for the portion that they give you. I have been to other steak houses that offered the same type of food for a little bit cheaper. Definitely try it but keep in mind that it might break your bank."

I don't know if it was the mac'n cheese but after the salad I wasn't feeling well.....then when the mac'n cheese came out and I had a few bites of that, it was OVER!  \n\nI had to abruptly leave dinner before we even paid, ran to my room- luckily I was staying at The Hotel so it wasn't too far for me to run!!! and needless to say.......I experienced my first horrific event of 'food not settling' which I haven't experienced for over 10 years at least!  I know it's gross to say.....but this was really the only place that I can recall that made me hurl!  =(    \n\nI know Michael Mina is a great chef and any MM restaurant is highly accredited with top notch food and service, and dont get me wrong- the service was great.....but as I said....the food literally made me barf!  LOL\n\nSo needless to say....I will NOT be going to Skirt Steak.....!  It may have been just a bug and not really the food, but honestly after I had my episode I was fine.....so I really think it was the food!  Yuk!!!"

Creamed spinach infused with bacon? If you're salivating already, Stripsteak is the place for you.\n\nWe made reservations for a Friday through the concierge at the Mandalay Bay (the StripSteak website said they were booked) but we were able to get an 8:30pm table for two the day of. The restaurant is located on \"restaurant row\" of the Mandalay in-between the casino and convention center. We arrived right on time for our reservation were seated right by the window. I recommend doing the same because it's perfect for people watching since everyone LOVES to stop and fondle the giant marble breasts across the way. (Ridiculously funny.)\n\nTo start things off, I ordered a Patron Margarita and Russ ordered a man-tini. We went to work pouring over the menu. We quickly discovered it was perfect for anyone who loves modern american comfort food.  As soon as we sat down our (extremely nice and helpful) waiter brought us out a complimentary order of Duck Fat fries - which we were happy to munch on while we made our decision.\n\nSpend your money wisely and invest in the $60 Kobe Rib Cab which was the best cut of steak I've had in a VERY long time.  It's 8ozs of deliciousness. I got mine medium and am happy to report it was juicy, full-flavored, and melt-in-your-mouth good. Russ's Porterhouse was also extremely tasty, but if you're willing to pay more for the quality - go for the Kobe beef selection. It was unreal and worth every $5 bite.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Milk Chocolate mousse which was the perfect way to end our meal. It was sweet and smooth, but not too heavy  -- we left feeling happy and full.  I asked the bartender to prepare me a special desert cocktail that would go with our desert and he made a delicious chocolate raspberry martini that I rocked till the last drop.\n\nTo those of you reading this on your Yelp app deciding what to do for dinner tonight or later this week on the Strip, look no further.\n\nI *Highly* recommend this one especially if you love warm, delicious comfort food that actually tastes amazing."

            "review": "After dining at Il Mulino, L'Atelier, Julian Serrano, our last dinner was at Stripsteak for the 3 course Prix Fixe dinner at $55/person and we ended on a positive note. First course: Blue crab chowder--chunks of crab but soup was a bit thin OR bibb salad with blue cheese dressing--good choice if you're going to overdose on the meat and carbs to come. Second course: slow poached prime rib--okay, but I still like PR the traditional way OR pay extra $10 for the ribeye steak--juicy, flavorful and worth the supplement. Third course: rootbeer float with choc chip cookies still warm from the oven--yes, this is the perfect ending to a rich meal. I loved the generous scoop of ice cream with sarsaparilla. In addition, we got pommes frites with different dippings that were excellent, and the sides to the entrees included truffle mac and cheese, creamed spinach, sliced brussels sprouts with bacon bits. You go away feeling really full!\n   The service was attentive and understanding, especially since I accidentally knocked over my wine, the glass broke and wine spilled all over our entrees. They cleaned up efficiently and brought us new entrees in about 5 minutes. I would return for another great steak dinner, especially since this prix fixe is available all evening and is a great value."

Strip steak is hidden gem inside of Mandalay Bay.\n\nThis establishment is an upbeat, loud, energetic type of place.  Service, is excellent.  Great teamwork, and no matter what you are ordering, service is always fast and efficient.  As a complimentary appetizer the chef provides a small sampling of the duck fat fried French fries with three amazing dipping sauces.  The perfect start to any meal here.\n\nMy problem is I am a creature of habit, and while staying at Mandalay Bay for the ETA Transact 2016 convention, Strip Steak is a typical favorite of ours and I always get the same thing.  Their NY Strip is an amazing cut of meat.  The perfect amount of marbling to give it awesome flavor.  I like my steak cooked Medium, and they hit the mark every time.  Succulent, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  Their Caesar Salad is a perfect compliment.\n\nDessert menu is pretty standard but I had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was also exquisite.  \n\nMandalay Bay has an excellent selection of restaurants, but Strip Steak is definitely at the top of the list!  Enjoy!!!"

Wouldn't recommend for 2 person dining.  They used iPads as menus for the wine list.  Pretty cool     Although I wouldn't have minded a traditional menu. Place has a contemporary modern feel in which I can understand the use of the iPad. \n\nStaff:  Great staff.  Accommodated well. Had birthday card signed by staff members on the table. Made effort to attend to our needs as far as noise level.  Very attentive. \n\nFood:  Not the best for steak IMO. Ordered rib eye (not the wagyu) medium rare.  Had better steak at other high end steak houses. Rice pilaf was bland. Wife got 6 or 8oz filet. Ordered well done. Butterflied but still didn't come out well done. Had to send back to get cooked some more.  Comp'd fries were awesome. Came with 3 sauces. Each was unique and good.  Even had to use it for my steak (which I don't do often). \n\nOverall:  Maybe if I ordered the wagyu, it may have been better. I would come back only to see if the wagyu rib eye is worth the extra $$$. Which was approx $30? more for a 10oz less cut."

OMG, talk about delicious.  They offer you 3 different types of dipping sauce but honestly, it isn't necessary.  The fries are addicting.  You've been warned ;)\n\nThe porterhouse is reasonably priced ($78?) and is big enough for 2 people.  There's no wow factor as porterhouse is usually the same at most places.  It is served with some pearl onions and baby carrots.  \n\nChilled seafood is also a good starter.  The portion could have been bigger but the selection was quite good..  It had lobster tail, lobster claw, a few king crab legs, a couple oysters and a couple clams.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself, but I had to share =)\n\nSalads were decent but WAY overdrenched.  Be sure to ask for light dressing.\n\nIt's a nice decent steakhouse, but definitely not a destination restaurant.  Do try it out if you're staying at the Mandalay."

            "review": "On my most recent trip to Vegas, I made StripSteak my steakhouse to try.  I've been to Delmonicos, Charlie Palmers, and CUT which were all way better then StripSteak.\n\nFirst off the restaurant has a hip and modern feel.  The one thing I noticed that I really didn't like was how crowded the room is.  The tables are basically one on top of another, not much spacing at all.  On to the food.\n\nFirst came the Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  I was looking forward to the them but came out underwhelmed.  They tasted like french fries.  They were good fries but did not understand all the hype.  Next I ordered the crab cake appetizer.  2 pcs filled with dungeness crab fried up like a hush puppy.. It was decent but nothing spectacular.  I found too many shell fragments in the crab cake.  Maryland style crab cakes are way better.  For the main course I ordered the 6 oz Japanese A5 NY Strip, grillled Foie Gras, and Truffled Mac & Cheese.  The steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  It came with a Yuzu dipping sauce on the side which added nothing to the steak.  The one thing I didn't like was that it was way over seasoned. (for a $185 piece of meat it should be perfect)  The foie was good not great.  The mac & cheese was pretty good.  With all the components being so rich, I didn't have room for dessert.\n\nService was decent.  I was not offered the potato foccacia bread.  Not sure if this was because I was solo but I didn't make a fuss about it because I honestly wasn't as hungry as I wanted to be because of brunch earlier in the day.  This was my first time at a Michael Mina restaurant and I came away unimpressed.  I'll try another one of his restaurants before passing final judgment but this is probably the one and only time I'll eat at StripSteak"

We were staying at Mandalay Bay for the night, there for the Silversun Pickups/Muse concert (awesome, by the way) later that night so we made reservations for StripSteak. \n\nYes, the duck fat fries were very good. I preferred the truffle oil fries, the others didn't seem all that different than regular seasoned fries to be honest. I absolutely loved the richness of the potato focccacia bread. For appetizers we went with crab louie with avocado lettuce cups and the lobster, bacon-wrapped fritters. The crab cups were so fresh and came with a great spicy sauce...very refreshing and bite sized (especially after the heavy amuse).  The lobster fritters were served on a stick and came with a great, light, almost frothy lemon dipping sauce to roll into the lettuce. Again, light and refreshing, especially for something that was fried. \n\nWhat was not light was the rest of the meal. I ordered the ahi, seared rare, very delicious and well seasoned for not being blackened. Sides were truffle mac and cheese and bacon creamed spinach. To die for! I am not a mac and cheese person, but figured I'd give it a try, and love it! I was so upset with myself for filling up and not being able to finish everything! I really tried so hard. My date got the prime rib, which he enjoyed as well. \n\nI wish I could review a dessert here, but no room left in the tummy. Great combination of having a nice dinner without being frou-frou on the food or portions. If you're in Vegas, it's a must-do!"

Foie Gras Sliders melts in your mouth!!!\n\nFor the entree, I had the 8oz Wagyu American Kobe Rib \"Eye\"\n\nBy far one of the best pieces of steaks I have ever had.  It was soft like a marshmallow and melted like one in my mouth.  During the meal of course we ordered a nice bottle of wine or two and it really brought out the flavor of the meal.\n\nFor sides we had the, Truffle Mac and Cheese, Asparagus, Scalloped Potatoes, and the Bone Marrow.\n\nAll awesome, but the Bone Marrow really stood out of the bunch.\n\nNow for dessert....\n\nWe all had a glass of scotch and ordered some Beignets with some aged whiskey sauce and creme brulee sauce.  Man that was awesome as well.  Crispy on the outside and soft as a pillow on the inside.\n\nAll in all a great meal, due to the fact that every course was great.  I did not have one bad thing and the service was wonderful as well.\n\nThe place is expensive, but you should know that before going in and just forget the price and enjoy the night with some of the best steak you will have.\n\nSo do it to it and try Strip Steak next time you are in Sin City!!!"

It was packed and loud, so I guess that's a good sign. \nTo be honest, I wasn't impressed with our waiter. He seemed like a casual Billy Corgan type who was interested in talking to you so long as you were increasing your order. No small talk, 0 personality, and the real piss ant is he conveniently didn't add our restaurant.com coupon to our bill. He may have forgotten, but frankly this is the second time this has happened to me in Vegas, and seeing how just about every other attraction in Vegas is designed to suck the money out of your pocket I can't help but wonder if it's not a coincidence. They must slip more than a few bills under the noses of patrons who unknowingly assume they got their discount but fail to check after a bottle of wine, but not me, and I'm not too forgiving about this ether, because I think it really is intentional. \nAnyway, the food is what saved this place from a more negative review because in the end that is all I really and truly care about anyway. Anyone can learn how to carry a plate of food to a table, but it takes a talented individual to craft a work of art in the kitchen. \nWe had salad to start. Frankly I wasn't impressed with my caesar.  It seemed a bit bland. I was hoping this wouldn't be precursor to the rest of the meal but in this rare occasion it wasn't at all. Salad must not be their thing because the rest of the meal was mind blowing. I had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn. Ummmm....the food was utterly fantastic. The filet was of EXCELLENT quality. Perfect taste and texture throughout, and the accompanying pepper sauce was not a creamy peppercorn sauce like you usually get, but more of a demi glace sauce with peppercorns - truly the sauce I have been after for years.\nThe sides of the mashed potatoes 3 ways was stunning. They serve 3 little bowls of mashed taters. One is sour cream and chives infused, the other is lobster infused, and the third is horseradish infused. Each was the creamiest, smoothest mashed potato I have ever had, and was accented perfectly with its character ingredient. Wow. With the steak it was just superb. The creamed corn with jalapeno was very good, although not the best ever. Still very nicely done though and no complaints.\nTo top it off, and the reason this place is a solid 5 star experience and worthy of one of the most smitten reviews I have ever posted was the simple divine experience I had with the Executive Chef, Ben (lost his business card but remember his name).\nI was walking out of the restroom, and stopped by to look at their see-through window next to the grill where they cook the steaks and other entrees. I noticed what seemed to be a chef standing nearby, so in a spontaneous moment of gratitude I went up to him and told him how much I enjoyed my food. He was very nice, and after I asked a few more questions about how the steak is prepared, he said \"come on, I'll take you back.\" He actually took me back in the kitchen past all the kitchen staff who were probably thinking \"WTF is this guy doing in here?\", and took me straight up to the grill where a few beautiful steaks were in the home stretch. He explained the process, how the steaks actually soak in clarified butter at a perfectly controlled temperature before they are grilled. This would explain the awesomeness of the steak, actually, but now that I've tasted it I know that it's the best. He enthusiastically answered my other questions about the kitchen (\"is it really like Hell's Kitchen??\") and then ushered me out of the kitchen. I don't know why this is such a big deal to me, but it really just impressed the heck out of me that the Executive Chef of one of the best restaurants I'd ever been to was so down to Earth and gave me an impromptu tour of his kitchen. I remember as a young boy my dad would approach the cockpits of planes even during flights sometimes to talk to the pilots, and they would bring us into the cockpit, explain a few neat things, and then with a wink we'd be on our way. Obviously those days are gone forever, but tonight I had a bit of the same feeling; the man running the ship gave me the tour with no expectation of anything in return. Clearly I don't believe this kind of thing happens that much anymore and that's why I'm so ecstatic, but it was a privilege and an honor to meet him and I cannot thank him enough for his exemplary skills as both a chef and a business man. \nI'm a fan of Strip Steak for sure. Maybe next time if I win big in Vegas I'll try the Japanese Kobe (it's not cheap). Until then I'll enjoy a superb domestic cut of beef and be glad I can afford the luxury."

But, given that everything here was amazing (the appetizers, main meal, sides AND desert) it is an overall winner and now at the top of my list. I'm just sad that it is in Vegas and not in LA. Also - I figured it was about $200 less than Cut for the same meal / alcohol combo. Be sure to get the donuts with dipping sauce at the end of the night!"

I called ahead about a week. No problem! They couldn't get us at one large table, but we were seated next to each other along the back wall across from the freezers. I was told this at the time of the reservation. \n\nThe service was excellent. My sister and Parents got a cheap bottle of wine(95 bucks). \n\nAppetizer of lobster in tempura with some kind of cream sauce was awesome! It comes on a stick (fried) then you dip it in the sauce, pull it off the stick and wrap it in a leaf of lettuce. mmmmmmmmmm. \nWe also got the Kobe tart tare. Its different, my pops freaking loved it. \n\nThe main course!! I got the American Kobe (65 bucks) it was grub, super soft 8oz. Mom and brother in-law went for the rib eye. Get it off the prefix menu, Its 55 bucks for anything off the list. If you order the rib eye you pay 10 bucks more and get the same cut you would order of the a la cart! Excellent value!! My wife got a special cut, I don't know if they always have it, it wasn't on the menu.....it should be!! Bone in fillet Mignon!!! IT WAS BETTER THAN MY KOBE i think it was 58 bucks 14 oz with bone. My pops order the standard fillet mignon. Not as tender as the bone in, but excellent. The rest of the group ordered off the prefix, no one complained about the steaks being over cooked. \n\nSIDES, you only need one side for every 3 people!!! I personally tried a bunch of them and you cant go wrong with any!! Mac and Cheese is the best hands down. The rest are great, spinach, potatoes with caramelized onions were bad ass, peas were freaking unbelievable, they tasted like they were picked an hour ago!! Onion rings, well they were onion rings. \n\nDeserts were great!! everyone got the doughnuts that come with the prefix. I went for the 12 dollar cheese cake. It tasted like it was twelve bucks!! Caramelized black berries. Enough said! I wobbled back to the casino. \n\nAt the end of the night the bill for my family of 6 was about $700 bucks. \nI am definitely going back there next time I am in Vegas."

Ordered the Aviator and peach cocktail to start...both were very refreshing and tasted great. I liked that they had the wine list and cocktails on an iPad.  Made it very easy to browse what you were looking for.  \n\nFor the appetizer went with the yellowtail tartare...peppers on top were a little spicy, and I love spicy food.  Took them off and it tasted much better. \n\nThe chef also brought over a plate of three sets of fries with dipping sauces.  One was truffled, one with sea salt, and one with fried in ducked fat.  Great way to build appetite.  \n\nFor dinner ordered the bone in filet and the bone in ribeye.  Both were cooked to perfection, tender, and tasted great.  Also as a bonus out the bone marrow on the side.  \n\nFor sides we ordered the black truffles Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Loved both of them.  \n\nWould definitely come back!  5 stars!"

StripSteak has several side dishes to choose from and we ordered the Mac and Cheese based on our waiters recommendation.  The waiter said this was enough for 2 people, I'd have to say it was enough for at least 4 since we had the fries and entrees.  Dinner was amazing and unfortunatly we skipped dessert.

I was recently in LV staying at THEhotel and visited STRIPSTEAK on consecutive days. \n\nWe actually stopped in for the Happy Hour which turned out to be a great deal. From 4-7pm all the apps were 1/2 off and beers were $3. \n\nOver the two days I ordered, split, and/or tried the following: Duck Fat Fries, Skirt Steak, Crab Cakes, Kobe Sliders, and Lobster Fritters. \n\nFirst off, none of them disappointed and some of them (crab cakes, and fries) I had the first night and went with again on the second. The DFF's were great. Each fry matched it's sauce perfectly. The skirt steak I will save for last. The crab cakes were the most unique I've ever had. Usually you think of a handcrafted pan sauteed cake. I have no clue how they got this crab cake so perfectly shaped (probably a mold) and so crispy but it was amazing. Not short on crab and had the right amount of of kick, great dish. Next were the Kobe Sliders. For those of you who claim you can't taste the difference between regular beef and Kobe or grass fed beef, there is a McDonald's right across the street from Mandalay. The sliders were seasoned well and the whole burger was delicious. The lobster fritters were, you guessed it, great. So very light and fluffy and a light creme fraiche to accompany it. Last and very much the best was the skirt steak. I actually didn't believe it was skirt steak because of the tenderness. I was lead to believe skirt was a very tough cut and expected it to be very chewy. Quite the contrary, this steak melted in your mouth. That, along with tasting out of this world in terms of seasoning, made this my favorite dish. \n\nThe last thing of note was the service. A+. We had the same two bartenders serve us both nights and there were awesome. Two of the most easy going friendly dudes ever. They were right on top of things but weren't over bearing, it was almost like they could read our minds. They featured a homemade blended drink serve with one massive ice cube (apparently from a 20k ice maker) that was a blend of two different types of liquor (i asked but now forget which two) and is mixed with some fruit and other ingredients over a lengthy process and then put out in a colander sitting on a bed of ice. It runs for $14 a glass and the guys had no problem letting us try it. It tasted excellent, almost like an Orange flavor reminding me of Grand Marnier. Overall, it was enjoyable and worth the small priced compared to what it costs to get a mixed drink at every other bar, restaurant, and club in Las Vegas."

Ordered a vegetarian entree, my husband eats steak I don't and all it was was a slice of romaine lettuce that was literally thrown on the grill, a runny hummus that didn't even stick on the spoon, burnt pita bread, a tablespoon (literally) of Mac n cheese and some asparagus. The nerve of them to charge $30 for this. The mgr came over and asked what was wrong and i told him that the vegetarian entree prepared by the chef was disappointing to say the least and i showed him the hummus. He seemed shocked saying how people ask for the recipe of the hummus all the time. Not a very good response to someone who was clearly not happy with what was supposed to be an entree. It looked like the chef just threw together whatever he had laying around and called it an entree. Even more Strange since no where on the menu can you even order hummus so how would anyone even know that they make it to ask for the recipe? The appetizer we ordered originally was artichokes in a cream sauce but when it arrived it was nothing more than a greasy sloppy mess of a \"soup\" swimming in butter so we sent it back. Didn't even bother to tell the mgr about that one because i really didn't want to hear how that recipe is often requested as well. It was horrid. My husband had a steak and it was just ok. Nothing special about this place at all and in my opinion it's just another overpriced restaurant in a strip hotel. Ive been to much better ones at other hotels. Craftsteak at the mgm for example was much better as was delmonicos in the venetian just to name a few.Also careful when ordering steak as they seem to have their own grading scale on med med well and well done with about six variations. We saw a table right next to ours send their steaks back three times, each time it came out it went right back. Not a place I would care to revisit anytime soon sorry."

Ribeye ($51)\n2.  Strip steak ($44)\n3.  Truffle Mac 'N Cheese ($12) - so rich and yummy and I'm sure very bad for you but it's worth the sacrifice\n4.  Mushrooms ($16)\n5.  Tiramisu ($12)\n6.  Panna Cotta ($12) - this was a surprise, much better than expected\n7.  3 Coffees ($5 each)\n\nTotal bill was $162 before tax and tip for 3 of us.\n\nThe steaks were good.  We asked for medium rare.  Could have been a little more on the rare side but not bad enough that we would send it back.  Joshua, our waiter, was good too although he has helpers that clear and serve.\n\nWe all enjoyed the meal and would return."

I called from LA to have two items brought to the table for a friend's birthday dinner as a surprise (in my absence) and she made the process easy, and apparently listened carefully to what I had mentioned, showing true customer care, as even the wine my friend loves was recommended to her without her having to ask for it. She felt duly celebrated, and I cannot say enough about how memorable Strip Steak and Paige made this event for both of us. Many thanks, I will be patronizing your restaurant when I am next in town!"

To begin with we were given 3 variations of duck fat fries, compliments of the chef.  I started with the lobster fritters, my husband chose the duck spring rolls. Both really good, the spring rolls were served with a cherry dipping sauce, very tasty. The lobster fritters were suggested by our sever to first squeeze lime then add creme fresh and wrap in butter lettuce leaf, great. Thomas our waiter was awesome. The Kobe rib cap and spinach soufle were unbelievable, I think I had an out of body experience. I had 2 lemon drop martinis that were perfection. They use Kettle one as their well vodka! Can't say enough about this place. Worth every penny!"

Without doubt the worst steak I have had from a place calling itself a premium steak house. My $62 prime bone in NY strip steak was fatty and tough. Cooked over a wood grill my steak arrived with a layer of soot tasting like burnt wood. 3 out of 10 steaks had to be sent back to the chef to cook as requested. We had a 7:15pm reservation and were served at 9:15pm. The place was not that crowded. When I explained to the manager how bad my steak tasted and showed her the pieces of fat on my plate, she said, \"I'll have to check with our chef, maybe we got a bad batch of steaks\". Hard to find a bottle of wine under $100 but there were plenty of bottles over $300.\nI felt bad for the wait staff because they were very pleasant and did everything they could to try and turn a terrible dinner into a decent evening. All this bad food for only $1600. Michael Mina really disappointed me with his first steakhouse."

Two of them are good, but the truffle fries with truffle aioli is amazing. Wedge salad was good but nothing special. Beet and burratta salad was delicious (very soft, delicate mozzarella). Fillet was simple, but perfect. Mac and cheese with truffle oil is amazing, but very filling. Artichoke hearts with goat cheese is good, but nothing special compared to the mac and cheese. The asparagus was good, but falls in third place for the sides (behind the artichoke and goat cheese). Save room and get the beignets with creme brule to finish things off."

Walking in, we were greeted warmly and escorted to our table, which was in view of the glass wall where you could see the grill. pretty cool.\n\nThe waiter was a nice enough fellow, but after going through the menu (since it was our first time) I asked him what his favorites were. He seemed a bit miffed by that and told me to just listen to the rest of his speech.  And the rest of his speech basically constituted of the specials.  Ok, great, sorry for interrupting but really? you're not going to talk about what you like the most about what you just said and ignore a patron's request and just go into the specials?\n\nWe got the mac and cheese, spinach souffle, creamed spinach, and potato gratin for sides.  A buddy and I shared the bone in porterhouse.  Everything was good, not great. Basically, for the price point, I expected much higher quality and would rather spend my money elsewhere if this is supposed to be the 'standard' for $100+ a head."

Our waitress suggestd that we take off the top piece of bread so we could taste the foie gras more. Good call on the bread! I think if I had eaten it with the bread on top, the taste would have overwhelmed the foie gras. It had a slightly sweet sauce taste but it was delicious! It only comes in two small pieces though. \n\nI'm a HUGE fan of prime rib so I ordered this without even thinking. However, they cook prime rib really different here. I wish my waitress warned me because I wasn't a fan. She later told me that people either loved it or hated it. Thanks, you could have warned me :( There's a certain taste that you expect when you eat prime rib but this place didn't have it. But like she said, other people would love it.\n\nThe rib eye was pretty tasty, cooked well. The sides of truffle mac & cheese was delicious but extremely rich. The spinach was okay. \n\nThe root beer float dessert was a nice finish to the meal. Tastes exactly like what you would make for yourself as a kid but that feeling of nostalgia and the fact that it's not a heavy dessert was a nice touch. \n\nI probably wouldn't come back since there's so many other places to try but the meat definitely looks promising. Except the prime rib haha"

(medium-rare plus!) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib-cap: the robust flavor of the rib-eye, the tenderness of a filet, and the mouth-melting fat of pork belly. a trifecta worth the $60. the sides were awesome, but i couldn't stop loving each bite of my steak.\n\nkaty checked in, and i was impressed that the product delivered. she noticed my can of pale ale was out, and suggested i try an ipa. wine just wouldn't do with this steak, and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl. i mentioned to the server extraordinaire, that the only problem i had with the rib-cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth, the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished. \n\nkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo, palate cleanser. so my last bite was just like my first."

I really liked the look and feel of the restaurant, but I wasn't a fan of how they seated us (just 2 of us).  The tables were pretty close where we were sitting, and I felt the table was awkwardly long.  I wasn't too concerned about this part too.\n\nWe started out with complimentary Duck Fat Fries that came with 3 different sauces.  They came out a little cold, but for being free they were enjoyable.  I'm not sure I would order them off the menu, unless they came out piping hot.  (I like my fried foods as hot as they can get).\n\nMy fiance ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the rib-eye.  They butter poach their steaks, which makes them juicy and delicious!  I enjoyed my rib-eye, but the filet mignon was superior by far.  We ordered wine with dinner, but I can't remember what we ordered.  \n\nAs far as sides, we ordered the creamed bacon spinach and potato puree 3 ways (one was with lobster, one with horseradish, and one was cheesy i think?).  The lobster mashed potatoes WERE SOOOO GOOD.  They were amazing.  I liked the bite of the horseradish ones, and the cheesy ones were also very good.  The creamed bacon spinach had a liquid smoke flavor, which I was indifferent about.  It was good, but I think I would try something else next time.  I'm just not a huge fan of artificial smoke flavor.  \n\nFiance ordered a cappuccino for dessert.  It was above average, good for a steak house.  \n\nAll in all, I would definitely like to come here again, but I'll be trying out other steak places before my return.  I would definitely get the lobster potatoes again, and the filet mignon."

            "review": "Greetings from your resident picky eater.  I know you are probably surprised to see me write a review of a steak house considering I don't like steak and normally these hoyty toyty establishments do not cater to those with a palate of a five year old.  \n\nLet me set the scene.  My husband advised me he is taking me out to dinner yet would not tell me where.  This alarms me because after knowing each other for nine years he still tries to surprise me by taking me to placing such as Prime Rib Loft and PF Changs.  Guess where we are going??  StripSteak.  Apparently, you can get a coupon on restaurants.com and so he wanted to give it a try.  Panic sets in as I am worried what will I eat.. again I don't like steak and I especially don't like a steak I would have to pay $50 dollars for.  My husband Michael assures me he has looked over the menu and told me they have chicken dishes and even mac & cheese.\n\nUpon arrival we are seating and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable.  Michael had advised them we are there to celebrate my birthday.  It was two weeks ago but if I know my husband he was hoping to get a free dessert out of it.  There was a very nice happy birthday card placed at our table which I thought was a very nice touch.  \n\nLooking at the menu.. oh dear oh dear there is ONE chicken dish.. not chicken dishes (plural) as Michael had indicated.  Organic chicken it is.  Michael opts for the kobe beef burger.  I order a corona and Michael orders a Pepsi.  (Stay tuned as the Pepsi will come into play later on in my story)\n\nWe are then provided a sample of the duck fat fries three ways with three different dipping sauces.  They consisted of old bay seasoned fries, rosemary garlic type fries, and plain duck fat fries.  The sauces were some mustard cr\u00e8me nonsense (which kind of tasted like ranch), ketchup, and truffle aioli.  May I just say that the truffle aioli was amazing.  Who would have thought it would win over ketchup in my mind.  While enjoying our delicious fries, Michael is especially entertained in watching the people constantly stop to take pictures at their famous boob sculpture in the walkway to the Conference Center. \n\nMeal arrives.  My plate is very fancy with some onion jus drizzled around the plate and a lovely piece of chicken on top of some truffle mac & cheese.  Michael wastes no time diving into his kobe burger for which I think he foodgasmed after the first bite.  Now my chicken report.  It was delicious!!! So moist and flavorful - it better be for $30 bucks.  It had nice grill char marks on it which added to the flavor profile.  The mac and cheese was good as well but alert.. there were two broccoli thingies mixed in it and a couple of baby carrots!  This was not an invited guest to the party and I did not appreciate them hiding out under the chicken to surprise me.  Luckily I was able to remove most of the little tree top specs and continue with my meal without incident.  I decided to share my chicken with Michael.... \"This is not a normal chicken!\" he says as I think he was shared a spiritual moment with my chicken.  He then tried one of my baby carrots and asked for another.  Against my better judgment I tried the smallest of bites possible of the carrot and holy cow it didn't even taste like a carrot.  It almost melted in my mouth - probably all the butter it was drenched in.  I that that was the first time I eat a carrot since I was forced to stay at the table until I finished them when I was 8.  \n\nThe meal has now ended.  Our waiter asks if we would like to order dessert.  Although the $700 glass of cognac was tempting we decided to pass.  Michael was looking around wondering where is my happy birthday scoop of ice cream?  We then get the bill and I think Michael about had a heart attack.  Remember the Pepsi I mentioned earlier?  Well apparently they are $4 - each.   Michael had four of them because they are served in those skinny bar glasses that you could finish in one sip!  So he paid $16 bucks for Pepsi (not even Coke!) That was $9 less then my Corona.  I found it quite funny.  We did however receive two small bags of some sort of chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn which I didn't get the connection but thought was nice.  \n\nTo summarize, although places like this are not my cup of tea I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Be forewarned if ordering a soda that it is by the glass.  If I could offer any suggestions it would be to perhaps replace the broccoli bits with bacon in the truffle mac & cheese.  Even with our $50 coupon we ended up paying about $50 dollars out of pocket (thanks to Michael's soda binge) but this is a nice place for special occasion."

Stripsteak has changed a lot; new executive chef Gerald Chin just this Spring 2013 (former chefs at Bradley Ogden, Guy Savoy, Rick Moonen, Jo\u00ebl Robuchon); so I was stoked to see him again, since I've been following his work for a decade long now. He's also the latest winner of Chop on Food Networks 2013 season. \n\n       Stripsteak is such a new mordern steakhouse, nice and spacious lay out, top of the line steak, nice wine list and beautiful creative cocktail list. I was so thrilled to be here. \n\n       What was an unique opportunity to experience Japanese wagyu tasting along with hand-crafted Japanese whiskey cocktail pairings.  A homage to the return of Japanese wagyu to the Unites States, Chef Michael Mina took us through a tasting journey based on his experiences from a recent culinary exploration tour to Japan.  Mina Group barman/mixologist Carlo Splendorini, will pair each course with the perfect Japanese whiskey.\n\n      The event was hosted by Andrew Knowlton, Bon Appetit writer; and Want to see what Michael Mina does with $9,000 worth of Wagyu beef? And we got to eat it this meal, amazing - Please watch it here: http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/badaily/2013/05/michael-mina-wagyu-beef.html\n\n      Watching chef Michael Mina, chef Gerald Chin, chef Gary LaMorte worked their magic at ever single dish we ate were so delicious. Watched barman Carlo Splendorini shown us the ceremony of Japanese whisky was just stunning! I got to meet this awesome barman Carlo at Michael Mina and RN74 in San Francisco where he's often at; to see him here again, it was so cool!\n\n- Wagyu beef tataki - 3 ways, each with powder, spinach rolled in each piece, each has its own flavor, melt in your mouth, so marbled, no cooking needed! I die happy!\n   1. Aged soy salt\n   2. Fresh wasabi\n   3. Braised lovtus root\n- Parining with The Berrykin featuring Nikka 12-year Japanese Whisky\n\n- Wagyu beef broth and crisp tendon, Tokyo negi, ramen garnish (salmon trout, nori), quail egg - this broth was crazily tasty, rich, flavorful; Julie K. and I licked the bowl to the last drop!\n\n- Pairing with Gogo Yubari featuign Hakushu 12-year Japanese Whisky.\n\n- Grilled wagyu beef with charred Miso, at least 8 OZ of goodness gracious meatilicious! Crispy shallot, fried rice, ginger tamago - this is why  I work out 5 days a week and at least 2 hours a day to indulge like this! Worth every single sweat!\n\n- Pairing with Japanese Whisky ceremony featuring Yamasaki 12-year Japanese Whisky, served in a Bordeaux glass with banana aroma, this ceremony is worth the ticket to the event itself! \n\n- Beignets with Japanese Whisky pot de creme - Julie K & I couldn't eat anymore by now!\n\n     After 3 days for luxurious food and wines with 78 Michelin Stars chefs combined, this was how we ended our Vegas trip, in this high note, at Stripsteak steakhouse, no better way to say goodbye to Vegas.  And Stripsteak, I shall come back for you sooner than you know!"

The decor is very modern, with a small dining area (has booths as well as tables), a bar and a small lounging area. It was 5 people in our party, and as soon as we sat down, they brought out complimentary duck fat fries cooked 3 different ways: truffle, old bay and regular, and it came with dipping sauces. Next 4 out of the 5 of us ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-in rib eye, medium rare (cuts like butter, very juicy). As a appetizer , we ordered the roasted bone marrow, which was really good, but smaller than the other places I've ordered the bone marrow at. For sides, we ordered the potato puree trio that comes in 3 different flavors: sour cream/onion, lobster, and horseradish. Another side we ordered IS A MUST, which is the truffle mac and cheese! It was so good.\n\nOverall, the service was excellent, the food was great, but the place is pricey, but at the same time, you get what you paid for, so it was all worth it. I would highly recommend this place to other people, and I don't know if i can ever have steak from other places cause this place just set the bar too high haha."

You need to triy the Instant Bacon - this is one of the best things i ever tasted. \n\nHad the Wagyu Filet Mignon - it just melts away in your mouth. The truffled Mac&Cheese and the red wine champignons were perfect compagnions!\n\nThe atmosphere is a little too \"cold\" IMO - but the great food leads me to overlook this ;-)"

            "review": "I was really disappointed with my Stripsteak experience. I made the 5:30 pm reservation about 2 weeks in advance. I let them know it was my bday. We get there and had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated (when we got in, over half the tables were empty...) Whatever - thats fine. I got a little happy bday card from them and the waiter was really cool at first. Then I let him know we had a restaurant.com certificate and I don't know but I feel like maybe it went all downhill from there (not sure why they would be upset with this bc they still make the same tip amount if we didn't have the certificate.)\n\nWe got the duckfat fries. They were mediocre. So many people raved about these fries and I just didn't think they were anything special. They actually came out room temperature and seemed over cooked. I would have rather had some bread.\n\nThen we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Gold Label Kobe NY and I told the waiter that I wanted the Kobe Rib Eye and then the waiter convinced me that I wanted the Kobe Rib Cap. I said that I wanted something super tender and buttery and he said definitely Rib Cap. We both ordered our steaks \"medium.\" We also got a baked potato and the bacon creamed spinach. I asked for a wine that went well with my steak and I said I normally drink white sweet wines but i would do a red wine if he could recommend one. He didn't know anything about wine or he was being sort of condescending towards me bc I said that I never really drink red wine. I dunno. I just got a glass of riesling. \n\nThe food came out rather quickly - maybe thats because they barely cooked our steaks!! What the hell - they both came out RARE ( we ordered medium.) And this rib cap I got - it was super chunky and chewy and bloody - just not what I wanted at all :(  My boyfriends $85 steak was a bloody massacre. The inside was just pure mush- you couldn't see any grain in the meat at all. My bacon spinach was almost too bacony- I LOVE bacon but the flavor overpowered the spinach. My boyfriend said his potato was good though and the sour cream that was served with it was delicious. \n\nSince I saw peoples' bday desserts from Yelp photos, I was waiting for them to bring me an ice cream or something. They didn't, so I just ordered off the dessert menu - I got the Dunking Donuts- since our meals sucked, I was relying heavily on these donuts to make up for it!! These donuts literally took about 30 minutes to bring out - this took longer than the steaks lol. They wrote happy bday and I got my candle then we ate the donuts and... they were ok but I would have rather had Dunkin donuts or krispy kreme!!! When we ordered the donuts, we asked if they had vanilla (instead of the caramel that went with it) and they did. He asked if we wanted to swap it and I said I'd rather have just one caramel and one vanilla scoop. Who knew they would charge $5 for the little tiny scoop that was smaller than a teaspoon and that we demolished in one bite. lol. \n\nSo then we get the bill - $286.... yeah. thank goodness for the certificate we had then it came out to $236. We didn't even order appetizers!!! They charged $24 just for water. They charged $12 for the little donut things plus the freakin $5 for like the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream I've ever had in my life. This place is a rip off. We have no problem paying $300-$500 for a fabulous dinner experience but this one was far from it. There's hundreds of better places to eat in Vegas."

            "review": "I thought one of the coolest things about Stripsteak was that they bring you a trio of Duck fat fries instead of the typical bread in the beginning. It comes with 3 different sauces and all blend superb with whatever fry you are dipping it with. \n\nThe night we came, there happened to be a live band playing  nearby (I was told a convention just got out nearby) so it wasn't a quiet meal although I think it was just an off day. \n\nAfter the fries, they do in fact still give you foccacia bread baked in a mini pan so you have it all to yourself. Yummmm. I opted for the short ribs and my bf went with the prime rib. I know its a steakhouse but we just weren't in the mood for steak. The prime rib was not the best but I wouldn't be too hard to critique based on that because I'm sure they aren't known for their prime ribs. The short ribs were very tender. I ordered a side of jalepeno cream corn which I thought was very good. \n\nI really wanted a dessert but the dessert choices were quite slim. Nothing sounded to really pop. I ended up choosing a chocolate mouse with red velvet chunks on top. It was good. The service was pretty fast throughout the whole dinner and I really liked at the end they leave you with a bag of caramel popcorn dipped in chocolate sauce for you to take home!"

My boyfriend and I decided to come for our anniversary because we had something set up for us.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Kobe Filet and I ordered the mesquite grilled scallops, both served a la carte.  Nothing special about my scallops, I could have made them at home on a mesquite grill.\n\nWe started off with the crab cake and crispy duck thigh appetizer.  I have to say neither of those were anything spectacular.   Actually, as we were eating them, I wished we had ordered something else. \n\nFor sides, we ordered the potato puree trio and the spinach souffle.  Both, again just ok.  The spinach souffle was unique which I liked, but the potatoes were just three different kinds: horseradish, lobster, and sour cream and onion.  They also always bring out the trio of fries with the appropriate accompanying sauces and foccaccia bread as appetizers.\n \nFor dessert we finished off with their chocolate mousse dessert which I wish I hadn't eaten.\n\nAll I'm saying is for the hefty price of $74 for a piece of meat, you would expect everything to be amazing.\n\nI'm done with you Stripsteak.

I had the kobe ribcap, my other dinner mates had the kobe ribeye, filet mignon, and scallops. My steak was cooked nicely med-rare, and tasted amazing with fantastic marbling. However, it seemed like the other steaks were cooked just a bit less than requested. You can taste the mesquite wood flavor in the meat, although I didn't think it enhanced the flavor too much. The starter duck fat fries are excellent, as is the foie gras slider appetizer. The truffle mac and cheese is a must try. The mushrooms were a little salty (maybe they're supposed to be), but had good mushroom flavor. At the end of the meal, we were too stuffed to try any desserts, but their coffee was a perfect finish to a very nice meal."

            "review": "I have been to as many Michael Mina steak restaurants as possible after falling in love with Bourbon Steak in DC. I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what's not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don't let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say \" I can make food better than this\"- I'm not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. \n\n\nThe Steak\n\nI always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn't seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) \n\nThe Sides\n\nSome people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think \"You know what; I probably don't need another potato side\". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won't be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn't be done, I know it's probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. \n\nThe mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite \"crusty\" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. \n\nBroccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good."

Quite frankly, our steaks were incorrectly prepared.\n\nFirst some background: I make a middling 5 figure salary, so I can't afford to eat $60 steaks very often.  But when I do, it's usually worth every penny.  I've happily dropped $300 on a single meal because it's difficult to find world-class beef that is expertly aged and prepared.\n\nI ordered the ribeye medium and my fiancee had the filet mignon medium-well (each is currently $59), we had the spicy zucchini and asparagus sides, and we ordered two glasses of Michael Mina's cabernet.  When our steaks arrived, I was bitterly disappointed to find that my ribeye was overcooked, somewhere between medium-well and well-done (no trace of pink whatsoever), while my fiancee's filet was completely well-done.  \n\nOur vegetable sides were about quantity over quality: I'm not sure how many fistfuls of zucchini and asparagus is customary for two people, but the zucchini was hardly spicy and the asparagus was elementary.  I'm certain I could've made either side at home blindfolded.\n\nAll the work that goes into designing and executing such a beautiful restaurant flies out the window the instant the chef overcooks your steak.  When the apex of your evening on the town is your dinner, and the keystone of your dinner is your incorrectly prepared steak, it puts a damper on your mood.  I am not one to send back food, mostly because it irreparably throws off the timing of the meal, but when I mentioned to our server the problem with our steaks, she informed us that lately customers had been complaining that their steaks were undercooked.  She had received authorization from the manager to give us complimentary desserts, but we declined.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the quality of the beef was superb, and the pacing of the meal was comfortable.  We were treated very well, and the wine was satisfying.  This review is not about the price nor the value for your money.  It is simply about two overcooked steaks and two underwhelming sides.  At this level, there is no room for error."

It was horrendously overcooked and extremely soft, I could definitely taste the truffle but it was over-peppered and that taste was overpowering. It was also very oily/greasy. I mentioned it being overcooked, and my friend and I ate literally one small spoonful each so over 90% of it was left in the container but the server didn't mention anything else about it which I thought was poor service.\n\nDessert was excellent, I had the beignets with the butterscotch pudding.

The service here is outstanding---everyone is friendly, helpful, and on the ball. They even gave my friend (the birthday boy) a Birthday note. Additionally, the manager sent me a follow up email the next day to thank my party for the visit! \n\nOn to the meal: we were given two free appetizers---french fries cooked in duck fat, with various dipping sauces, and warm bread with rosemary. Both delicious! I ordered off the pre-fix menu (appetizer, entree and desert for $55) and had the crab soup, rib-eye steak, and creme broule---all delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. The Bday boy had the Kobe burger and also said it was fantastic. My boyfriend had the filet mignon, which he said was great. One of the best parts of the meal was the mac n' cheese the Bday boy ordered as a side dish. I highly recommend ordering this treat---it will be hard to return to that old staple, Kraft, after you have eaten this!! \n\nOverall: GREAT STEAK, friendly service, beautiful atmosphere!\n\nTip: I had a restaurant.com $50 gift certificate that we used towards our meal. Restaurant.com often has sales, and gift certs are generally 60-80% off. Thus, I got my $50 gift cert. for $4! Good deal! It really helped lower the cost of the bill, as it is quite an expensive place."

My dad's ribeye was so fatty, we had it taken away, and my steak was so salty it was nearly inedible. Even though I politely pointed this out to our server, she offered nothing besides a cursory apology. Even the drinks were terrible - there was ice in my martini, and the bottle of (red) wine we ordered with dinner came out super cold. Even though they knew it was a special occasion, I had to call back the sommelier to leave the cork with us! \n\nThe only redeeming thing about the meal was the oysters, which isn't saying very much. Will not return and overall was a horrible experience for the price."

OMG, greasy, drippy goodness...heavenly!\n-Trio of Duck fat fries:  OMG, all three were amazing.  \n\nPRIX FIXE ($55):\n-Bibb Salad w/ avocado, bacon, Oregon smokey blue cheese:  Their take on the standard steakhouse lettuce wedge.  The bibb felt a little limp and not as sweet, would have preferred the iceberg lettuce wedge.\n-dry-aged bone-in ribeye:  i ordered medium rare, it was overcooked.  They very graciously brought out a replacement (albeit a bit on the rare side), very quickly.  I enjoyed it.   The portions are ginormous, even for the prix fixe menu.\n-Select seasonal side dishes:  tiny \"tastes\" of house specialty sides, including the truffle mac 'n cheese.  yum!\n-Michael's root beer float:  i hate root beer...my bf enjoyed it.\n\nREGULAR MENU:\n-10 oz filet mignon ($54):  perfectly cooked, tender\n-Potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream and onion, horseradish):  loved the sour cream & onion and lobster!\n\noverall, i thoroughly enjoyed it.  What you're paying for is really expensive comfort food, but if you're up $1,000 on blackjack, it's a drop in the bucket!  :)  i would definitely go back!"

            "review": "Stripsteak was great, and we'll definitely go back next time we're in Vegas. We had a reservation, but decided to sit at the bar instead of a table. The bartender, Anthony, was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. \n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat casual for such an expensive restaurant (there are TVs in the bar area), but it was contemporary and comfortable. \n\nInstead of serving bread, they serve a sampler of three different types of fries (cooked in duck fat) with three different sauces. I can't remember what they all were, but I liked them all. We thought it was both odd and interesting to have fries instead of bread, but we enjoyed them. \n\nThe only disappointment of the evening was the wedge salad. We asked to have it chopped and split--and when it arrived it looked like two $2.50 side salads from Denny's. Seriously, an upscale restaurant like this should have a fancy wedge, with high-priced blue cheese crumbles, ample house-made dressing, and loads of freshly cooked bacon. Instead we received a small bit of iceberg lettuce with hardly any dressing or cheese crumbles and what my husband called \"bacon dust.\" You couldn't taste the bacon at all. (They should check out the wedge at Mastro's to see what an upscale wedge is like.) I think this wedge was around $16--maybe more.  Crazy!\n\nAnyway, things got much better when our entr\u00e9es arrived. I ordered the yellow tail sashimi appetizer, and it was some of the most delicious sashimi I've ever had. It was super fresh and tender--practically melted in my mouth--and it was prepared just perfectly, with just a touch of sauce and jalape\u00f1o; it had a perfect balance of flavors.  \n\nMy husband ordered the filet, and it was cooked perfectly--very tender and flavorful. \n\nWe also shared the potatoes gratin. It was like a large brick of thinly sliced, tender potatoes in a cheesy cream sauce (no unwanted ingredients, such as onions). They were delicious. \n\nFinally, we had to have dessert. I thought the beignets with three different sauces sounded delicious, but Anthony recommended the apple crumble (served with vanilla bean ice cream), so we ordered that instead. Anthony was right--it was great. He also brought out one freshly cooked beignet for us to try (so nice of him!), and it was delicious too. \n\nWe left Stripsteak fat and happy. Highly recommend! (Just don't order the wedge salad.)"

The hostesses were sweet and friendly, and once seated our server was professional and pleasant, never pressuring us to order hastily, really letting us relax and enjoy our meal.  The service here never disappoints - it is always on point.\n\nOysters and hamachi were the appetizers we chose, and both were delicious.  We really enjoyed the green goddess sauce served with the oysters, and the hamachi was probably my favorite dish of the night.  The fish was buttery and fresh, and the sauce drizzled over it had a nice heat that really punched up the overall flavor of the dish.  Definintely recommend trying it!\n\nThe steaks were perfect per usual, and the seafood was just as fresh as I remembered.  The server recommended the ribeye, and it really was the star of the show.  A blue cheese topping took it over the top, but it was not so heavy that the entire steak could not be finished by one person.\nFor sides we loved the mushrooms and pearl onions.  They tasted great as a topping on just about everything, but also as a side just eaten on their own.  The pureed potatoes were also creamy and delicious (something new that we tried), but the portion size was huge.  One order is plenty for 4+ adults to share, and definitely try them topped with lobster.  \nIf you save room, the sorbet for dessert is a simple, sweet way to end your meal, but if you are feeling more decadent, the dessert menu should not be missed.\n\nBe sure to make reservations - and don't miss the Hamachi!\n\nCheers!"

So I had a pre fix menu to choose from. The decor inside the restaurant was nice, and everyone was friendly when I arrived. \n\nThe server was friendly, but a bit slow. I started my meal with the mushroom soup and also ordered the Lobster Fritters. The fritters where very tasty. That was by far my favorite pert of the meal. Then I tried the mushroom soup. Maybe my expectations where to high, but I just didn't enjoy it. It was too creamy and barely served warm. No everything could be a winner tho. \n\nFor my entree I had the Skirt steak. Here is where they went from 4 stars to 2 stars. Normally I order my steak med-rare. My steak came out charred on top, and completely raw in the middle. I ate less then half of it, and had to give up the rest. I over herd my server talking to another table, saying that the steak is cooked under temperature, so I should have ordered it medium. Unfortunately, my server failed to mention this to me and got stuck with a tough, burnt tasting raw piece of meat. Not a winning entree. (It did taste great re hashed in my breakfast burrito the next morning however.)\n\nMy only dessert choice was a root beer float. Creative, if your 5 years old. Slow service and food below par. Maybe if I hadn't been on a pre fix menu it would have been better. With all the choices in Vegas, It will be tough to get me back."

            "review": "So I decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. Usually I try to avoid restaurants on the Strip because they're overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. Luckily I had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at StripSteak for happy hour. \n\nWalking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the Assistant GM Miss Ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. Our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. According to Miss Ashley, that was rare on a Saturday night. To me, it was luck because I would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. \n\nThe bar area is fairly small, I would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn't an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. Plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. Their happy hour drink & food menu is reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. And this means a lot since I'm more of a beer drinker. The raspberry lemonade & mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that's just my opinion. \n\nMy friend and I decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. Right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. These fries are cooked in duck fat so don't worry it's not any crazy duck part, which I would have hoped for. There are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic Parmesan. The sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, BBQ sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. I preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. \n\nOur waiter, Steve, was awesome. He highly recommended the Rib Cap & Filet Mignon, along with a side of truffle mac & cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. The Rib cap, which is the end part of the rib eye, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The truffle mac & cheese was definitely the best truffle mac & cheese I have experienced in a while. Most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it's flavor. We also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. I couldn't complain about anything. At first I laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating I was actually pretty full. Also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! And me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of Man vs Food. \n\nBut wait, we weren't done! WTH? Steve charmed us into trying dessert, I figured what the heck, let's go all out! We ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. Whew! I think I was getting drunk off the pudding, I might have been able to light a fire. However, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. \n\nOverall the ambiance of StripSteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. It did tend to get busier as the night progressed. Yes it's quite pricey but honesty I have to say it was the best experience I have had in a while at a Strip restaurant. Michael Mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. To see the AGM serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. She helped making the dining experience that much better.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. Maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz.. \n\nFood for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can't stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. Yay for TUMS! 4) All sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner."

Strip Steak didn't originally meet our requirements, but with a coupon from restaurant.com, it did.\n\nWe got last minute reservations on a Saturday night for 9:30pm, which was lucky because the place was packed!  Muse was playing the arena nearby so there was a huge rush before we arrived.  I had the ahi tuna and my buddy had the salmon.  Each was around $40, but with the coupon, it came out to about $46 after tax and tip.

Normally this area of a restaurant does not provide the most stellar of service but our bartender, Chris, was on point. He often checked up on us and made sure to glance over once in a while as well. \n\nWe started off with the wagyu steak tartar. The fat ratio coated our mouths and when paired with the Ermitage M. Chapoutier 1997 it was heaven. Although I was getting full by this stage we continued with their New York Strip, bleu cheese scalloped potatoes, and the creamed corn. I am glad we split because I would have gone into a coma. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. Cooked to a medium and I was not ready to throw in the towel. \n\nBy the time dessert rolled around, I was about to die. The chocolate cake with spiced cherries was decent. It was a concentrated brick of decadence. I am not always a chocolate person, which made this too much for me. The strawberry pavlova was the highlight for me. The chef takes a classic dish normally eaten in Australia and New Zealand and puts his spin on it. I have tried this dessert a few times while traveling abroad and never liked it. It tends to be too sweet. Stripsteak's version was a more mellow presentation. Before presentation a strawberry jus is poured over the fresh fruit. The combination of that with the basil ice cream is magnificent. We had also got the beignets with a McCallan 18 caramel which I didn't care for. Liked that the taste of the scotch was preserved well, but the pastry was too dense."

I couldn't help myself.\n\nSo from a recommendation from My T, I ordered the Wagyu Rib Cap... it is a slightly different cut from the Wagyu Rib Eye, and just $3 more.  According to our server, it is a special cut from the top of the ribs, and slightly more flavorful than the rib eye.  Honestly, I bet they are both delicious.  My medium rib cap came out, it was tender as all tenderness can be.  I had to resist eating it within 10 seconds.  Our sides were the trio of mashed potato (Horseradish, Sour cream and onion, and lobster).  I may have an eating disorder because I was dipping my duck fat fries and using the mashed potatoes as a dipping sauce.\n\nGreat meal, our server was very informative.  The restaurant is really nice and not loud like some of the steakhouses can be in Vegas (sometimes you feel like you're at a nightclub!)  There is a great picture spot where they have all the olive oil in jars along the wall).  I'm not sure how an animal activist will handle this place because there are glass windows with the Wagyu beef hanging.

For this kind of money and they large crowd it draws, they should be watching for your fork and knife to come together on the plate in the interest of turning the table over. We waited a long time for our check, and I think they only took notice when I got up to use the restroom."

It was the best steak I have ever had. I got a Kobe steak (forgot what cut) at Charlie Palmer which was amazing but for some reason the Wagyu Ribeye Cap at Strip Steak was better. I got it medium rare and it came out perfect, at first glance it looked like an ordinary steak but once I cut into the steak I knew I was in for a treat, it was moist and jam packed with flavor! My gf usually gets the regular rib eye which is amazing as well but in a different way. What turned me on to this place was the price, after browsing many steakhouses in Vegas, Strip Steak had the cheapest Wagyu steaks. =)  In addition to great steaks, their sides are pretty good as well. They also seem to always give you the duck fat fries which as others mentioned compliments of the chef. All I care is that they are free and very tasty too, they come with 3 very different dipping sauces. One of the sauces is basically ketchup, another is almost like a peppery bbq sauce and my favorite was the truffle sauce. I never knew fries could be so good with this sauce. Also if you order the iced tea, you get a cool mini pitcher of sweetner to add to your tea. My gf and I thought that was pretty cool and made the iced tea taste better than adding splenda or equal. Bottom line is this place is great and the price is just right. I will be eating here every time I'm in Vegas."

Can you get a discount?  Yup! Restaurant.com has $50 off certificates you can buy for about $4. Is it highly rated?  Yup!  Esquire Magazine has it listed as one of the top 10 steakhouses in the US!  Easy to make reservations? Opentable.com easy.  Is it modern and trendy?  Duck fat fries!!!!\n\nWe ordered:\nDuck fat fries (complimentary)\nFoie gras sliders $22\nPotato puree trio $14\nCreamed spinach with bacon sauce $10\nand we both ordered the Ribeye in bone $52 each\n\nSurprisingly, the duck fat fries came free instead of bread, and they were awesome.  It came with 3 sauces, truffle, ketchup, and ranch.  They were very crispy and you could totally taste the duck goodness in every bite, especially as an aftertaste.  I had been meaning to try duck fat fries in LA and they have a place on Western in KTown, but haven't tried them yet so this was an unexpected treat.  \n\nThe sliders were delicious, though only about 2.5 bites each.  The steaks came out and you could really taste the quality beefiness with the first mouth watering bite.  Very tender, flavorful and perfectly seasoned, bite after bite was lip smacking good.  I love mashed potatoes and the puree trio did not disappoint. They came in 3 blends: wasabi, lobster, and sour cream and chives.  Of the 3, I really liked lobster the best and though it didn't have any chunks of lobster the flavor was there and really well infused.  The other 2 were delicious though and if I had some bread to wipe up the remainder I most definitely would have.  The creamed spinach was awesome too, though pretty pricy for $10 with the amount they give.  Not a big deal.\n\nWe were also given $50 credit from Mandalay Bay because we were staying there and it was part of our package.  The restaurant is located in the casino so we actually got $100 off with the restaurant.com gift certificate.  You can't beat that!  One of the best steak dinners I've had and literally half off.

Overall, they were definitely not the mind-blowingly awesome fries/dips we've experienced in previous visits.\n\nThe spaghetti o's was very flavorful - we all enjoyed this app.  \n\nThe BLT wedge was delicious.\n\nFor sides, we had spinach, creamed corn and gratin.  The creamed corn and gratin were both delicious. The gratin was an excellent recommendation by our waiter - very flavorful and prepared very well. The spinach was just okay - definitely not on par with the spinach souffl\u00e9 which used to be an option. \n\nOur waiter ended up being one for two with recommendations as unfortunately, two of us ordered the Wagyu rib cap based on his recommendation and suggestion that \"people come back here just for this cut of beef.\" Well, I may want to come back for the gratin, but definitely NOT this steak.  We both ordered the beef medium rare. They both were served at medium and in some spots medium-well.  Apparently the grill was way too hot as both were also burnt on the outside (not a nice crisp/carmelized), so much so that I had to trim away most of the outer portion of the beef.  The beef was nearly devoid of flavor and most definitely NOT Wagyu quality."

For sides, we got the bacon creamed spinach, trio of potato puree, and mushrooms ($14 each). The steak was delicious but the foie gras was really raw in the middle, the bone marrow was overly salted, and both the creamed spinach and mushrooms were mediocre. The potato puree was the only thing besides the steak that was yum.

However he did get us our food promptly and to our 9:30 show on time. \nIn short, I had ordered the Kurobuta pork chop and thought I might regret a few minutes after placing my order.  After my first bite I was glad I strayed off the normal filet dinner.  This chop was the biggest I had ever seen.  It stood about 2 inches high and was seasoned perfectly.  I was worried the thickness would not allow it to be cooked thoroughly but there was no pink to be found.  The mushroom risotto and pork jus accompanied the chop very well.\nFortunately my wife ordered the CAB filet, had it butterflied to ensure it was cooked to medium plus and it did not disappoint.  The potato gratin was incredible and the broccolini had the perfect amount of citrus added to it.\nWe had to catch the 9:30 Michael Jackson One show and did not have time to order a dessert but fortunately we all were provided with popcorn drizzled in chocolate which was a sweet way to end our meal.

The place is nicely designed and of course has the usual eye-candy-ish host staff at the front desk that you learn to expect at these fancy schmancy type places. The young blond hottie proceeded to seat me right next to another couple who were dressed to impress while I was looking slightly better than alley trash. My first thought was to ask to move, but then I decided that since I might get bored at any moment that I would just sit there and eavesdrop on their conversation. \n\nWhen I gamble I usually either GO BIG, or play really conservative, so I decided to treat this meal the same way. I pulled out a quarter and gave it a flip. Tails for cheap. Alright the theme has been set. Instead of ordering the $180 wagyu 8oz steak I opted for the 16? 18? oz $51bone-in rib-eye. For a side-dish I chose the \"caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes\" which came in at like $13 or $14. I also ordered WATER. Bottled water sir? No, just regular water please. Oh and with the steak please bring me an $18 a glass of this cheap Cabernet. Would you like an appetizer to start off with sir? No. A salad or some crab-cakes? No thanks. I'm not really starving right now so I can wait. \n\nSo as the waiter rushes off I proceed to listen to the life-stories of this couple I was seated next to and waited for my food. Ahem, Sir the chef sent you this complimentary fries, three different types of fries, each paired with its own special dip. Actually these fries were pretty good, but if you go here, I wouldn't spend 9 bucks for them, just wait for them to get comped. \n\nAnyhow, the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but it had a little more fat and bone than I would have liked. The scalloped potatoes were excellent. A little rich for some people I would suspect but good for me. \nWhile savoring the taste of the rib-eye, a thought occurred to me: When I cook rib-eyes over mesquite wood at home on my BBQ after seasoning them properly, they taste almost exactly like this. Ahh well, probably just overestimating my own potential again. \n\nTo give this place a fair review I would probably have to kick out more cash than the $94 bucks I spent here. It was good. It is probably a great place to take a date to impress or the wife/girlfriend/mistress for some special occasion.  I guess you are paying for the ambiance.  It was good and I'll probably end up here again after pillaging the Mandalay blackjack tables, but not overly impressive, at least with the cheap stuff I ordered."

The tatare was very good, it came with awesome pesto which complemented the sweetness of the meat very nicely.   The salads were good, but nothing to write home about.   The tomahawk was excellent.   We had it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked.   40 ounces is a fair amount of meat, but it was good.  The veggies were also pretty good.  \nFor dessert, we had beignets,   Wow!  They were awesome.   Get the trio of sauces.  You have to plan ahead and save a little room for them but it was worth it.   Our favorite was the Macallan scotch sauce.   We never received the fries that everyone talks about, but that's ok because we had plenty of other food.  \nOverall, it was a very nice dinning experience.   The food and drink were all very good.  This is relaxed place to enjoy a good steak.   Particular shout out to Katie.   She did a great job of keeping things flowing at the perfect pace and she was very fun to talk to.  \nWill I be back?  Sure I will, I love steak!"

We ordered the foie gras trilogy and it was unlike anything I've ever had. We both ordered the wagyu center cap and it has to be one of the best steaks I've had in my life. We ordered black truffle Mac and cheese, again the best and a baked potato which was nice. Overall a wonderful meal with a helpful staff.

It came with some sides--a small thing of creamy spinach, okay. A small thing of mac'n cheese, tasted pretty nasty. A small dish of steamed vegetables, mostly peas, probably from a can. \n\nThe potato bread was greasy as heck. Duck fat fries, also very greasy--nothing special, don't listen to the other guys. In'n out has way better fries. Someone should tell the people cooking back there, more grease does not equal better tasting food. The dessert was really good, however (kudos to the dessert chef). That, and the hostess (kudos to the hiring staff) were about the only redeeming qualities.  \n\nI used a $50 restaurant.com coupon and still it seemed way expensive. This is more of an overpriced tourist joint for people who are staying in the hotel and don't have cars. If you are stuck in Mandalay Bay, I would suggest Aureole or Lupo, both had better food. A short taxi ride away is McMullan's Irish Pub next to the Orleans which also has better food (try the \"chips\")."

FANTASTIC service.\n\nthe trio of fries were delish...but we tried so hard not to eat all of it for fear of not being able to finish our main course.  the truffle mayo was exquisite...and it was dang hard not to soak up every single fry in it.  the fresh out of the oven rosemary focaccia bread was WOW.  i didn't even get a chance to take a picture of it cause we just dove right in.  it was buttery, warm, and so good that after a couple of pieces, i found myself not trying to look at it or else i'd devour the rest of it.  \n\nboth of us ordered off the prix fixe menu which was well worth the pricetag of $55 each.  don't forget your restaurant.com gift certificate which takes 50 bucks off your bill!  we took advantage of the discount and decided to order an appetizer...so we got meat at its purest level...the kobe filet tartare.  man oh man...if i could, i'd skip everything else on the menu and just order 3 of those for myself.  the server came to our tableside with a plate of the diced kobe, a quail egg, and seasonings.  he mixed the tartare right in front of us explaining every single ingredient and placed the mixture into a bowl with ice.  it was served with some pita bread.  the tartare itself was enough to give this place 5 stars...the quality of the kobe was amazing!  a must try when you come here...\n\nnow the first course...wifey had the crab chowder while i chose the bibb salad.  the server said that every bowl of crab chowder is made to order.  the chunks of crab in the bowl were generous...and the broth itself was super tasty.  but my salad...mMmmm...i absolutely love blue cheese...and my salad had 2 different types.  wifey gave me the stink face though but was still willing to try it.  yummy!!!\n\nwe both decided to order the slow poached prime rib...who wants to order chicken from a steak house?  the server warned us that ordering medium guarantees you medium rare...which was perfect for us.  so medium it is!!!  the prime rib was super tasty and tender.  no juices splattered over the plate which means that the chef knew what the heck he was doing.  it was served with a side of delish au jus and creamy horseradish.  our entree also came with 3 sides...peas and carrots, truffled mac n cheese, and bacon creamed spinach.  i left the peas and carrots alone since they weren't anything special...and devoured the rest of the side dishes.  the truffled mac n cheese was OMG good.  don't truffles just make everything that much better?  yum.  \n\nand then dessert...root beer float with sassafras ice cream and root beer sorbet...served with chocolate chip cookies baked to order...oh, and a chocolate straw.  the server was nice enough to even put a candle on wifey's plate and happy birthday written with chocolate.  before we tried our dessert, we had to ask ourselves...how good can a root ber float possibly be?  haha.  this root beer float was of course, the best root beer float i have ever had.  amazingness.\n\nloved this place...can't wait to try michael mina's other restaurants...i've heard great things about his lobster pot pie.  yummy!"

Over a hundred bucks, but can easily feed two people. So amazingly tender, and perfectly cooked. Nicely charred exterior, with bloody red medium red interior. Crust was seasoned perfectly, and the wagyu marbling really came through in the steak's tenderness and flavor. Wow.\n\nMy Caesar salad was good, although it did not stand out in any real way. The same goes for the sides. Very good, but not terribly memorable. What I really remember (and still have dreams about) is that wagyu steak. My goodness.

Oysters were good but I hate when there is any she'll and every oyster had a little bit of shell. \n\nThe steak shined. I had the Wagyu rib cap and it was incredible. I had it once at Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse, which was excellent but this was transcendent. I almost did not order because at Mina's SF steak house, Bourbon, it was VERY mediocre. Again, one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had.\n\nSides were great. Everyone, myself included loved the Russell sprouts but I personally enjoyed the truffle Mac cheese the most. It had a full truffle flavor that stood up to the whole meal.\n\nNormally, I avoid the desserts but because everything was so good and they did not disappoint. The cheese cake had a lime filling that was incredible and the tartness worked very well. We tried a couple other desserts, which were also perfect, but I forgot exactly which ones. \n\nOverall, a fantastic evening."

Good flavor and char. We also ordered an accompaniment of foie gras. That was delicious. Roasted, slight crisp on the outside, buttery on the inside. great portion and quality.\n\nOur group ordered sides to share. I'd say pass on the grill asparagus. It wasn't especially great, and a little over cooked. The truffle mac and cheese was great! Creamy, flavorful, smooth. The creamed corn was so-so. The corn seemed chopped up and the texture wasn't that great. It was also a little too sweet (and not natural corn sweetness). The creamed spinach was also very delicious. Again creamy and smooth. \n\nThe service was very nice and very accommodating. I was here for a bachelorette dinner and they comp'd a few orders of duck fat fries for our group. They were flavorful and crispy. Very good fries. They come in 3 flavors.. one truffle and 2 other seasoned... my favorite was the tuffled fries :) great flavor. They also gave us packages of caramel corn at the end of the night. That was also very very good. A dark caramel so it was extra nutty, but not burnt and drizzled lightly with dark chocolate. The slight bitterness of dark chocolate went really well with the nuttiness of the caramel. It was not too hard but had a nice crunchy texture. Looked great and tasted great!\n\nWe also had a melon mojito at the bar (hh in the late afternoon at the bar only) and it was really good too. Nice strength but not over powering and great taste. Not too sweet and lots of lime and mint, and a slight hint of midori."

Yes, the Scotch menu is a big thick book, like a Scotch for Dummies because it gives a complete history of every single distiller and a thorough description of every single malt from that distiller.  And if the Scotch for Dummies bible isn't enough, the bartender Chris was wonderfully knowledgeable about the vast selection of single malts.  Unfortunately, the bar isn't really a great setup - not a lot of stools at the bars, and the tables for the bar area felt like they were almost in the middle of the walkway leading to the Event Center.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant is a very comfortable space, but the food is awfully pricey.  Very good, but not sure it's worth the cost.  Well, except for the delicious duck fat fries (served instead of bread), which were complimentary.  I had a foie gras appetizer that was one of the most delicious variations on foie gras I've ever had (not that I can remember ever having a bad foie gras dish), but it was $32.  The 90-day-aged sirloin steak was $72 - very good, but I've had better steak at lower prices.  The grilled asparagus was really good, just a tad too expensive at $14.  I ordered dessert, but can't remember what it was, just that it was really good too (and obviously not the least bit memorable).  Again, our server was also terrifically knowledgeable about the restaurant's impressive Scotch menu.\n\nSo the vast and reasonably-priced single malt menu is worth going back for, but the bar isn't a great space.  The dining room is very comfortable, but the food menu is priced just high enough that I don't see myself going back there to eat.  If Stripsteak had better bar seating or slightly lower food prices, I'd be a die-hard regular.  As it is, I'll probably be back every once in a while.  If you're a single malt guy, Stripsteak's Scotch menu is too good to resist."

OMG ... stratospheric. \n\nLet me elaborate: I long for the days (1980's actually)  when you could get amazing food, huge portions, never ending buffets (with steak, lobster, crab legs, etc.) for $5.95. Yep, those days and deals did exist. Even 5 start hotel rooms could be had for $100 a night. The casinos made their money from the gamblers, so they wanted to attract everyone with great prices on room and board. It worked... until Vegas became a hip destination for the rich, the famous and politicians. They wanted fancy food, top notch entertainment, clubs... so why not charge for that? So you have it.\n\nStrip Steak was undoubtedly a great experience, our Wagyu steak was excellent, the potato gratin fantastic (although I still think the version served at Fleming's in Coral Gables is better), and the broccolini (it was Ok). We had a good red wine (it cost $90 ... crazy for an average red). Note that I have an issue with Wagyu meat... it costs much more than \"grass fed\" equivalent, but I can't really tell the difference. Although the price at Strip Steak was not bad ($65 for a 12oz Wagyu Skirt Steak, the one that broke all records was the Wagyu filet at Nobu in NY for $25 per Oz.. that is insane, unless it had a secret side effect like growing hair or curing ED).\n\nBut high end places in Vegas are now like Strip Steak... good to great food and service, but prices that require a credit from the casino cashier manager in order to cover the \"experience\". We were two guys, one Wagyu steak each, one side each, one bottle of wine and two deserts... $300 with tip... wow. Good thing we were on expense account, and now I have a week to come up with an excuse when the secretary questions the expense... like \"Elvis just left the building...\".\n\nIn summary: if you landed in your private jet and took the Bentley with the scantly dressed Victoria Secret's model as a chauffeur, then I'm sure you will thoroughly enjoy the food and service of Strip Steak. If you are a commoner (like me) I suggest you put it on your boss' credit card. If both scenarios are not doable, then head to downtown Vegas, they also have great places for a fraction of the cost.\n\nBut don't take me wrong: I loved the food and the service (by the way, our waitress was beautiful, sexy and very efficient.. kudos!), but I had to knock off one star due to the high price... it just doesn't make sense...sorry.\n\nCheers!"

            "review": "The scene: 18 of my closest friends and me for my birthday party.  September 2015\n\nThe menu: The \"Holstein\" pre-set dinner menu (with upgrades)\n\nWe all get it - Vegas is pricey.  But instead of paying $30-$50 for what amounts to fancy dorm food at a buffet, I decided to live it up a bit for my birthday.  Therefore, months of planning led to this epic dinner.\n\nFirst of all, given the sheer size of my party, I knew there would be some small issues.  Stripsteak does not have a private dining area, but they set up a nice table for my guests.  The ambiance was perfect for my type of outing - trendy, and certainly upscale without being stuffy, where you would have to worry about using the wrong fork and be without another for the rest of your night, as punishment.  I would probably give 4 stars as an individual rating for the \"value\" of the set-up vs. what it cost, but then there was...the food.\n\nAhh yes, the food.  What really matters.\n\nFirst of all, pretty much everything at Stripsteak is served with complimentary duck fat fries.  Deliciously crisp and decadent, and accompanied by 3 dipping sauces (but good enough to not require any accompaniment.)  Now here's a little secret - still have a small ghetto streak in me where I like my fries served with my steak, so it was a little strange to have these as an appetizer, but surely a great way to start off the meal.\n\nPer their menu, my group had the choice of salad or a shrimp cocktail appetizer, entree of flat iron steak, chicken, or salmon (I have no idea how the non-steak items tasted.)  Upgrades to filet mignon or ribeye were available.  And given the decadence of my spending, an upgrade for sure was necessary.  (More on that below.)  Additionally, sides were served \"family style.\"  Broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and I can't remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  The truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn't order steak.)\n\nAhh yes, the steak.  Peruse their menu and you will see that Michael Mina doesn't drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  With all respect to USDA grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...\n\nWorld Wide Wagyu.\n\nAnyone who has done steak research knows that Japanese Beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  \"Kobe Sliders\" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true Kobe Beef.  Even cows that are designated \"Wagyu\" may not be imported from Japan.  So, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of Wagyu (beef derived from a line of Japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  These cuts:\n\nAmerican Wagyu Rib Cap - rib cap is the new trendy top cut of meat.  It's generally the best couple ounces of your ribeye, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled wagyu cow.  This cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.\n\nAustralian Wagyu Short Rib - tender, fall-apart, as if it were braised.  (I didn't check to see if it was actually braised short rib or not.)  \n\nFinally, real Japanese \"A5\" grade Wagyu Filet Mignon.  A5 is the highest grading that Wagyu can have in Japan, based on beef yield, color, and the all-important marbling score.  I wish I could have seen a photo of it before it was cooked, to visualize all the delicious marbling.  After cooking, it tasted like pure meat butter.  Delicious.\n\nAfter a meal like this, I'm not sure if I can ever go back to eating steaks even at fancy local steakhouses.  Of the three, I am declaring the American Wagyu RIb Cap the winner in an ever so slight margin over the Japanese A5 Filet (though, likely, just because it was Rib Cap).  The Australian came in third, but was still delicious.  Wagyu, you may have ruined me for life!  Thank you, Stripsteak, for introducing me to it and making me an addict.  \n\nThank you also for an incredible birthday with a ridiculously good meal."

The restaurant is very loud and not easy for discussions at your table.  I will say the service was great and the truffle French fries were amazing.

            "review": "Good lord, where do I even begin? This was an amazing dining experience. Im probably going to run out of adjectives pretty quickly! First off I have to start with our server Brian. This guy provided us pretty flawless service and is a fantastic server. Friendly, professional, knowledgeable with the menu and preparations, and just the right amount of checking on us. \n\nWe arrived around 5:30 and were one of the first ones to be seated. By the time we left the restaurant was packed full, however our level of service never changed. Brian had many full tables but we never had to look for him or ask for our drinks to be refilled. \n\nAs first timers Brian went over the menu and as always we asked for suggestions which he was happy to provide. The complimentary duck fat fries were soon delivered. Served with three different dips a great start to the dinner. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi appetizer. Although the fish was fresh and flavors were good it was our least favorite dish of the night. For $24 I was expecting a lot more than five small bites. \n\nFor our steaks we ordered the 16 oz prime bone in ribeye and the 10 oz prime filet. Brian said it was the best filet he's ever had and I would have to agree. Both steaks were cooked perfectly as ordered. My NY had great flavor and was served with melted butter on top. The filet was phenomenal, so juicy and tender. For our sides we chose the jalape\u00f1o corn and potato gratin. The corn was really good but the gratin...out of this world! Thin soft layers of potato covered in melted smoked gouda. \n\nTo finish we had to order Strip Steaks famous beignets. A staple on the menu since they opened they come in an order of 3 or 6. If you order 6 you get a trio of \"sauces\" which of course we did :-)  The beignets were incredibly soft, served warm and cooked to perfection and then dusted with powder sugar. Two of the sauces, the mocha and the vanilla were actually a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e style and not a sauce. The third one, a butterscotch you could pour on the beignets. A perfect ending to a fabulous dinner that I will not soon forget. \n\nThank you Brian and Strip Steak for such a fantastic meal."

We ordered a dry aged bone in rib-eye and the 10oz filet.  Being I was recovering from a bad stomach and really shouldn't have been pushing my stomach to digest such meaty delights I thought I should go easy on my sides and inquired with the waiter if there was anything off the menu that wasn't saut\u00e9ed in butter, cream, or cheese. He graciously offered that the kitchen could do some simple vegetables (spinach and garlic and mashed potatoes) which were just as he said, simple. Service was attentive and very helpful and the steak was juicy, cooked perfectly, but not out of this world. Complimentary Duck fat fries sound indulgent but its still just French fries and how fancy can those really get? Great wine selection. Pricing was on the high side as our meal for two with drinks and no room for dessert came out to a little over three bills. Crowd was hip but definitely not trendy. Overall Kind of cheesy 90's lounge style interiors. I would hope for more 'cool' factor since it is Vegas. I can check this place off my list now. Overall no serious complaints but also no \"Wowie!\" either."

            "review": "So you say you want to hear about this steak...well let me indulge you\nin this experience... 14oz Bone-in Filet Mignon!\n\nWhen it first arrives it seems a bit intimidating, bulky even. You see\nthis piece of meat and think, I see nothing special or glorious about\nthis, let alone why it would cost $57. If anything, this chunk of meat\nwould be thought dry due to being over-cooked, or too bloody from\nbeing too thick to cook properly. So you first cut into it with your\naverage steak knife, and what do you find? \n\nThis knife, though somewhat blunt, seamlessly slices through the thickness. The tenderness is AMAZING!! Not only that, there is no trail of blood typically found with such large portions of meat cooked over a fire. \n\nThen comes the first bite. Words can not truly describe the sensation, but the closest I can come up with is that it feels like a meatgasm in your mouth. Hahahaha but seriously, the flavour from the seasoning of the steak was phenomenal, robust and savory with a hint of a wood burned taste. Once you've slightly regained consciousness from the amazing flavour of the steak, you then realise the meat is moist and tender that it literally melts in your mouth. You chew with little to no\npressure and it still falls apart in your mouth, then mixing\ncompletely in your mouth. \n\nBut when you think it can't get any better,\nyou continue to chew thinking you never want this feeling in your\nmouth to end. You eventually realise that it does need to end, that\nyou will need to swallow. It then becomes a bitter sweet moment, when you think of how you must end it by swallowing, but knowing there will be another to come soon afterwards. Yet when eating, the following bites are never as wondrous as the initial...except for this steak.\n\nEach bite was as good as the first. Every single bite left me with the\nsame feelings as the first. And no matter how full I was becoming,\nthere was no hesitation in each bite, no thoughts of stopping due to\nover-consumption. There was only one thought in mind...ME WANT MORE STEAK NOW!!! Even to the last bite, which I then cut into 3 more\npieces to try and extend this experience, it was wonderful throughout.\nI will be back for this steak..."

Perhaps they expected you to invest another $6 in a sauce (a variety offered) but this doesn't provide a great wine pairing...\n\nAll the salt missing from the steak, and then some, was in the sides.

I decided to try the 18oz bone in  ribeye and my girlfriend had the 8 oz filet mignon (the special) it started with flavored duck fat french fries and several dipping sauces (instead of bread), which i was a big fan. fries do tend to harden up pretty fast, so they did tend to get a bit rubbery as the night went on. We then shared a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon....very good and classic starter.  The steaks came out... mine ala cart and hers with a few sides ( the special) They were both cooked on the flaming grill which could be viewed from the dining room. the sides of truffled mac and cheese , the brussel sprouts with bacon and the spinach with..... you guessed it  .... bacon!!  were all good. Really though how can you go wrong with adding bacon??? the wait staff were very nice, and our waiter even gave us a few samples of wine to try before we made our decision ( I like that) \n  On to the highlight!  My steak was a little more fatty than marbled, a little undercooked (which they fixed) and a little smaller than other 18oz ribeyes I have had ( the aging ??) anyway I could have had a bad piece as the filet was very tender and flavorful ( this was a great restaurant week deal) and the special even came with a mini creme brulee and 2 beignets. I must say that this is a 3/12 star place but I cant do that!  BTW we did stop by the first night for Happy Hour and I did have the Prime Rib sliders 2 for $10.00   they were excellent!

I think it was because we had intended to go to Shanghai Lilly but it was closed and we ended up here.  I liked it much better the second time around.\n\nWho can resist their complementary duck fat fries?  The perfect way to start out our culinary experience.  The starter came with 3 different sauces that complemented the 3 different types of fries they gave us.  Our table ate them up!  They were so good.  I would go just for that!\n\nThe chicken breast was the perfect portion of white meat and pieces of crisp dark meat.  It came with truffle mac and cheese that was more delectable than it should have been.  A nice balance of cheese and truffle oil, but not too much truffle oil that it was over powering.\n\nTheir special was a pork chop with jalapeno creamed corn which was my FAVORITE part of my dinner.  It wasn't too spicy like I had anticipated.  The first bite is a kick but once you get to the sweetness of the corn, it extinguishes the fire of the jalapeno and becomes this perfect balance of sweet and spicy.\n\nThe potato puree trio was pretty darn good.  It came with 3 different potato purees: lobster, onion and sour cream, and horseradish.  They were a great compliment to our chicken.  it was like a creamy potato soup.  I really enjoyed the sour cream and onion.\n\nI give them an extra star for our wonderful waitress Lisa.  She was efficient, friendly and gave us a special treat at the end of our dinner.  I really liked her.\n\nIf you happen to be at Mandalay, this place is worth stopping by, if nothing else, get the duck fat fries!"

            "review": "So either I'm crazy, I had an unusually bad experience, or I've just eaten at some really good steak houses and this one does not compare to those AT ALL.\n\nHere's my story:  made a reservation, got a great seat by the window so we could people watch, table was ready when we got there [good], and then everything went wrong from here.\n\nTook a friend of mine here from San Diego, I live close to Mandalay Bay, & I had a $50 Restaurant.com certificate, so it was a logical choice. My only downfall was I took her to Panevineo the night before so the dining experiences were extremely different.\n\nThey don't serve bread to start, but rather french fries. Interesting. Making America fatter, I dig it!  I have never seen this before, I'd rather eat these with my meal then prior, but whatever. Fries were great! I mean they weren't McDonald's fries but they were dang tasty.\n\nOrdered 2 cocktails, one with a splash of cranberry [that never happened], limes in the cocktails were actually quite gross. They looked old and discolored they had been cut days prior and when we got brave enough to squeeze them into our drinks like 2 drops of juice came out.\n\nWe ordered a stripsteak, lamb chops, and brussel sprouts [see pix].  Lamp chops came out extremely under done since my friend is Greek and ordered them well done, her mom likes to over cook lamb and that's how she's used to eating it.  She put some brussel sprouts on her plate and then we proceeded to hunt for our waitress so we could get the problem rectified.  Friend starts  eating the side dish on her plate, flag down a bus boy, who tells another waiter, waiter comes and removes her plate from in front of her--doesn't even offer to get her a side plate so she can continue to nibble, but says they'll bring out more sprouts. \n\nNow she has no food, no bread, so she's staring at me. Naturally, I offer some of my meal to her she starts eating some of my steak [fine].  About 10 mins later lamb comes back ready to be eaten.....no sprouts???? About 10 mins after that round 2 of sprouts appear.  OK so their preparation is interesting on this as well, they shave the sprouts so they remind you of cole slaw????  Add bacon and then drowned them in butter. Like there is a pool of butter on the bottom of the dish. Not my favorite. My strip steak was ok, but it needed chimichurri.  There wasn't really a selection of sauces you could put on your steak much like you would see at STK or other fine places in this city.  Menu was rather limited and lacked depth to me.\n\nNo apologies for food, etc [fine] .  Bill finally comes, we've been here now for like an hour and a half, give them the restaurant.com certificate, and now the waitress has to find the manager to take it off.  ANOTHER 10 mins goes by, finally get the bill back, and thankfully we checked b/c they took the certificate off but then added 18% gratuity. OK. Our waitress was not worth 18%, I can guarantee you that, but fine.   What I didn't like was that she didn't mention that the tip was on there, which I HATE.  She was sat with a 10 to 15 top in the back, and 3 tables of 4.  THEN another table sat down of 6 men. They got the menu, waited a bit, no-one came to help them, they got up and LEFT--and I don't blame them.\n\nSo that was my story and my morale is: pick another steakhouse :) there's some really good ones in town."

I don't like steak so much. I'll keep this review short and simple. \n\nService - A+++! Our waiter impressed us with his recommendations, his manner, and how attentive he was during dinner. I heart him. \n\nFood - A+! My husband ordered the skirt steak with a add-on of crab legs. Originally he ordered the lobster tail, but our waiter recommended the crab legs, since they are a bit bigger, more bang for your buck! (I said that not the waiter lol) He LOVED it. He was smiling the whole time. He was happy that the waiter recommended the crab legs because he loved them too! \n\nI ordered the Kobe burger. I ordered it well done. I always order my meat well done. My burger came out kinda charred. Not sure if it was the \"well-done\" factoring in. I actually had to cut the top and bottom off the patty so I could taste the flavor of the meat. It wasn't a big deal. Like I said I am not a big meat person. I didn't mind if my meat patty was 1/2 the size in the end. If I ate here again, I would def not order the burger. I was eying the roasted chicken.. maybe I'll get that next time. \n\nThe sides! The mac and cheese is a must order! We also ordered the scalloped potatoes which wasn't AMAZINGLY good. For 2 people I would say one side order would've been adequate. We barely touched the potatoes. Probably because I ate all the fries... \n\nMy husband wants to come back every time we are in Vegas. Yes, it made him that happy. And trust me this guy is hard to please!"

When I got there, I discovered it was only 4-5:30. Pretty crappy considering all the restaurants that surround it had 4-7 happy hours with $5 drinks and aps.  Also, the happy hour food options did not match the website.  I did not see Kobe Cap Pastrami Slider, Baked Crab Dip, or Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho as options.  But you can get hummus. For $6.  Yay.\n\nHappy hour drink selections were also very limited but they did have 3 wines by the glass at happy hour prices that were not listed.  After I had a crappy melon mojito, the server informed me that there were secret wine selections.  I got a pretty awesome glass of sparkling wine for $6.  So make sure to ask about those specials. \n\nSince I went, it looks like they've at least partially updated their website to the right hours.  But the happy hour food selections were still wrong as of today.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  Why can't restaurants keep their websites accurate?  Is it that much of a chore?  Do they forget that they have websites?\n\nAnyway, if you are stuck on the Strip, there are better happy hours to be had than Stripsteak."

Instead of your normal bread & butter, Stripsteak gives you a sampler of 3 different types of french fries (paprika, regular, garlic) and 3 dipping sauces for you to munch on.  They get an extra star for originality!  \n\nI tried their cucumber martini... which was refreshing at first but started to taste too cucumber-y towards the end.  But once again, extra star for being innovative and atypical.\n\nI'm not a big meat person so I ordered their alaskan halibut.  Nothing fancy - just grilled with some herbs/spices on top.  But it was still very juicy and not overcooked AT ALL.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered some steak special they had ... I forgot the name but I had a bite and it was tender and JUICY!!! \n\nFor sides, we ordered their truffled mac & cheese and asparagus.  Once again, excellent.\n\nGreat ambience, great service, great food... only downside is the prices... but then again, it is suppose to be fine dining so no negative points in that aspect.\n\nProbably the best steak house in Vegas that I have tried thus far...

After looking at several menus we decided on Strip Steak. Wife's pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. Yeah, you've probably met a steak lover before. Not like this guy though. \n\nFor starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. Familiar to me since I GOT MARRIED THERE! It is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it's called \"Strip\" Steak. \n\nVery extensive wine and cocktail list sure to please anything you'd crave. The dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. There were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you've grown to love from a nice steak house, baked potatoes, creamed spinach, etc. Let us get back to the important part - the steaks. \n\nWe were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. Now that sounds pretty weird, but it's cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. In theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. \n\nOur table ordered the east coast oysters of which I only had one. It was perfect though. The wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you'd expect on a steak house chop salad. Pass. \n\nI selected the bone in rib-eye. It was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. No fancy sauces tonight. I also had the creamed spinach I mentioned above, and it wasn't that good. They sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. Also, they spinach was not as creamy as a creamed spinach should be. Am I being picky about spinach? I suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. \n\nOverall it was a great meal. I had a few cocktails from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. The cocktails are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. \n\nI saved the best for last. When your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. One set of fries is fried in duck fat. Absolutely NOT gross. Paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries I've ever had in the history of me eating fries. They were so good I almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so I could have the side of fries it would have come with. \n\n4 stars out of 5 for the creamed spinach thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. \n\nNote: If you're an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and I can't imagine you could do a ton better. Great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation."

You know that nutty NON-IRONY taste and weird yet interesting smell.\n \nFor the quality of food...it is WAY Overpriced. AND i dont usually complain about price as long as the food is outstanding tasting. Stripsteak is NOT! Definitely does not taste like a true \"DRY-AGED\" steak! I had the bone-in rib-eye and it tasted like Costco steak...which taste good....but not $51 for 18oz good. My Gf had the American Wagyu....terrible! No marblization no flavor punch...just another eye of rib taste. Ive had both \"Dry-aged\" bone-in rib-eye and Kobe steak before and the steaks at strip steak do not even near the realm of the taste you encounter when eating the true stuff....sooo dissappointed.\n \nLobster tail not at all fresh or worth the price. Roasted Mushrooms tasted too wierd...also too expensive as well. Scalloped potatoes...barely OK. Merlot Excellent! Their Focaccia bread thing was a heart-breaking waste of dough. Roasted Bone marrow was OK. French fries was your basic multy times fried re-hash fries...SUCK...BUT the sauces was Good & seasoning good!\n \nAll in all, just too over-priced for the type of food...the food served here is the same level as Outback steak house....Please believe me, i am not even joking. Please save your money and buy 3 ribeyes for $22 at costco....same taste...trust me! I wish this place did work out for us but sadly it failed horribly. WHats worse than that was the websites that i looked at that actually said that stripsteak was good dry-aged steak. i feel like the credibility of these websites is shot. Sounded like these guys knew what they were talking about...oh well....THANK GOD that we had the Restaurant.com coupon or i would have been a lot more angry at what i could have paid for this substandard experience!

A big seating area with exceptional service. The complimentary duck fat fries set off a great tone. Three different duck fat fries flavors with three different sauces. I was very impressed with this complimentary dish that I was going to ask for more. For my main course I ordered the wagyu kobe filet. I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked. It tasted so soft and flavorful. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The sides I tried were the potato puree, asparagus, spinach souflee, truffle mac and cheese, and crab cakes. My favorites were the potato puree which was a very soft whipped mashed potato in three different flavors. Amazing presentation and amazing tastes. My other favorite was the truffle mac and cheese. I just couldn't get enough of that thing. This is how all my meals should be. \n\nRecommendation: Wagyu filet steak, truffle mac and cheese, and potatoe puree"

            "review": "For a Michael Mina restaurant, I expected a lot more.  I was definitely disappointed because I overpaid for the food.  Atmosphere was great and the service was great too, but it's the food what counts.  I went with my family and we ordered a bunch of things.  They provided us with the trio of duck fat fries, which was the best part of the dinner. There was an aioli sauce that was fantastic.  The fries were not greasy, but so aromatic and melted in your mouth.  We ordered several appetizers.  The lobster mini grill cheese with a side of tomato soup was the best tomato soup.  It was light and slightly sweet.  The sandwich was really greasy and buttery and I couldn't taste a hint of lobster for the life of me.  The foie gras came in a form of two small burgers, which were adorable but I didn't touch it. We had another appetizer that had something to do with crab, but can't remember it much.  Then came our steaks and sides.  Everything was REALLY salty.  It wasn't just me and my palate, everyone mentioned it even before I did.  The bacon creamed spinach was the worst, I think the bacon didn't help the saltiness of it.  I couldn't eat it after one bite.  Which was really disappointing because I always look for creamed spinach as good as Lawrys.  The mac and cheese was also salty.  Since it was truffled mac and cheese, I expected it to melt in my mouth but of course it was salty!  also they used cavatappi pasta, which is hallowed corkscrew pasta that they cut short...not the best for mac and cheese.  Scalloped Potatoes was nothing special and the mushrooms with onions were also really salty.  Thought I would get a nice piece of steak, since it is a steak house but, it was really salty as well.   It was nicely cooked, and perfectly charred and would have been perfect if someone had not dumped a bottle of salt all over my food.  I was just bewildered and thought it must be a mistake or an abberation, but, I don't know, not coming back here again.  The passionfruit panna cotta was really sour...it made your face pucker horribly and the creme brulee was nothing special either.  Very disappointing and expensive."

So after I took my girlfriend to a show, I wanted to treat her to a nice dinner.  And this was the closest steakhouse near the show.\n\nThis place may be the best steak that I had ever tasted.  I ordered the ribeye which was very tender and seasoned to perfection. They did not overbutter their steaks like some other nice steakhouses.  \n\nAlso, they give you fries as instead of bread.  The fries are seasoned differently with various different dipping sauces.  I dont know if they do this anymore, but they did do this when I was here last. \n\nThe decor is typical of a fancy steak house, but I love the fact that they have some cuts of meat on display on windows.\n\nDrawback of course is the price, but hey, what do you expect..it is a fancy steakhouse.\n\nGreat steak, great sides, great everything."

            "review": "I arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. I mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn't stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did I want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. When the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the Restaurant Week menu. As that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.\n\nWe also noticed a birthday card from the staff. Details, people, details!\n\nGetting to the good stuff (well, mostly):\n\nDuck-fat Fries (3.5/5) - The truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. The herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, STRIPSTEAK!). The last one, I can't remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don't like mustard). \n\nFoie Gras Sliders (1.5/5) - Ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the grilled foie gras they list as an extra. We were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. OK, we thought, we'll try it. Spoiler alert! It was still a single piece, just sliced in half. This made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. The bread (I tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. The garnishes were OK. A single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. Overall, high hopes dashed.\n\nDuck Spring Rolls (3.5/5) - Generous portion and, I was happily surprised, not too heavy. The wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. Again, however, it was not heavy. The crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. The meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. It was a bit dry in spots. I am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - Fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn't weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\n\nNY Strip (4/5) - Slightly overcooked based on our order. We were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. The sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\n\nRoasted Chicken (4/5) - A tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. I love that they left the skin on; I don't eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. The truffled mac n' cheese (4/5) was really good. Almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it's own amazing profile.\n\nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Biegnets (5/5) - The brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. The biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. Another detail we thought was fantastic, sis's dessert came out presented with the words Happy Birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\n\nWines (5/5, nail on the head every time). We started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of Gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish Oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. We spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked AND what we ordered). Given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\n\nThe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. There were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \n\nAll in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\n\nWith the Restaurant Week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional foie gras, our total was $300 and change. Bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!"

Hopefully he brings this restaurant to San Francisco, as it blows away all the other steakhouses there.  I was not disappointed here.  \n\nMy friend and I started off our dinner, after watching \"Love\", with the Crab Cakes, Tomato Preserve, Tabasco Vinaigrette and the Lobster, Chilled, Black Truffle Vinaigrette,Baby Lettuces.  Both were excellent.  They even gave us the StripSteak Trio of Duck Fat Fries complementary. The sauces severed with the fries were a barbecue, truffle, and ketchup.  The truffle sauce was the best.  Our entrees were the American Kobe Rib Cap and American Kobe Fillet Mignon.  Both of the Kobe beef was cooked to perfection of medium rare and seasoned perfectly.  It was so soft, that you didn't need a knife to cut it, especially the rib cap...gotta love that marbled fat. We accompanied our steaks with the Sauteed Baby Brussel Sprouts, Bacon Lardon Steam Asparagus, Mascarpone Beurre Blanc.  The brussel sprouts were out of this world...again, cheers to fat, this time the bacon.\n\nI was so stuffed, but I forged on to eat dessert. I had to live it up as it was my last night in Vegas.  We both shared the beignet with butterscotch pudding and the dough nut with banana fosters. Both desserts were OK, and here is where I think the improvement needs to be made.  The butterscotch pudding was not memorable, as it was not as sweet as I would have liked it to be.  \n\nI would have given it 5 stars, but the dessert was a little let down. But the services was excellent.  Shout out to our server Kyle, another local boy from Hawaii, \"you da best\".  In all, a very enjoyable dinner.  Plus they gave me one of the menu's when I asked if they had a take home version. \n\nCome here for the American Kobe beef, and if you really want the authentic Kobe A5, that too.   mmmm...marbled beef.......drool."

It was cooked a perfect medium-rare and had flavor beyond anything I've seen in my life.  Maybe my expectations were too high or what not for this second time around, but I got the burger again.  It was a little bit burned on the outside and below rare on the inside.  The waitress made a pretty snobby comment when I asked for a new one \"You did ask for it medium-rare\" to which I replied \"I did, in which I'd expected it to be cooked\".  She brought out another one which was cooked just about the same way, except a bit more burnt and a bit rarer in the middle; I ended up not eating either.  I ended up asking for the manager and getting the burger off of the bill.  \n\nThe filet my wife had was tasty, but I'm not sure if it was a $56 steak.  Then again I'm pretty cheap.\n\nGotta put a shout out to the tasty fries they bring out to start the meal.\n\nMaybe your luck will be better than mine, my first time there I would have given 5 stars but this time more inclined towards 2 or 3, only giving 3 due to the manager being cool about the grills running hot or whatever else seemed to be happening.\n\nI still feel sad though, and maybe I'll chase the dragon once again some day."

We're not big meat eaters, but, hey, you can only take so much chicken before you start sprouting feathers.\n\nI lost count of the number of staff who wished him a happy birthday, from the hostess when we arrived, to the hostess when we left, and all manner of staff before, during and after the meal.  And there was the Happy Birthday card on the table, and the tiny dessert with a birthday candle at the end.\n\nWe started with the amuse-bouche Fries - three kittle cups with different seasonings with three paired dips.  I'm not a Fry Freak, but I have to admit I just couldn't stop, even with all the salt (I'm giving up on complaining about salt, which is just too pervasive in restaurants).\n\nBoth of us ordered the NY Strip, and it was good enough to make me a meat eater.  Perfectly cooked.  Juicy.  Tender.  We ordered Asparagus in Horseradish Beurre Blanc and the Truffled Mac & Cheese as our sides.  The asparagus was fabulous.  But the Mac & Cheese, which they're famous for, was just too rich for my taste.  I know I would've been happier with the Scalloped Potatoes, but hubby wanted to try the Mac, and it was his birthday, so...  Besides, I was too full from the complimentary fries to even get through the steak, so it was no problem to eschew (pun intended) the macaroni.\n\nThe service was terrific - not elegant, because this is a casual place, and that's just the way I like it.\n\nMy one nit-let about this very stylish space is the chairs.  They're very comfy, upholstered arm chairs.  But the arms are as high as the table tops, so I couldn't sit as close to the table as I like.  It made the comfortable seating a bit uncomfortable for Petite Moi.  But not so much that I wouldn't go back.  Maybe for my birthday?  October's not so far away.  Hint, hint."

Unfortunately the flight was delayed (surprise, surprise) and I was going to cancel the reservation, if not for the fact that the husband got extremely upset and insisted that we find out the latest they can fit us in.  Turns out that they were able to move us to 10.45PM, so we took that spot and rolled the dice.\n\nWe landed at 10.15 and went straight to Stripsteak, carry ons and everything, just so he got his Stripsteak fix.\n\nOne bite into the duck fat fries (served with three different sauces, my favorite being garlic aioli) and the rib cap (the best, fattiest part of the ribeye steak) I understood why he was so noticeably upset at the prospect of not being able to make this dinner. \n\nThe steak was the most amazing cut I've ever had - it was a relatively small piece (about 7 - 8 oz), but gosh, the meal was satisfying! It's not like digging into a hunk of meat, the fat was intertwined with the muscle so as to give the beef a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture.  \n\nEqually fantastic were the the foie gras sliders (more, please!!!!!!) and beef shabu shabu (similar to the one served at the SF's Michael Mina) as appetizers, and beignets with creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e as dessert.  But if you're only allowed to order one thing, it has to be the rib cap."

The complimentary fries were pretty good. Basically, the fries were provided in three stainless steel cups, with each cup filled with different flavored fries: parmesan, truffle, and duck fat. I also tried the West/East coast oysters. Those were too fishy for me...maybe the flights that shipped those oysters were delayed. My party ordered a few appetizers of which was the bone marrow. The marrow was topped with an overwhelming amount of onions. The richness of the marrow disappeared, as a result. \n\nNow onto the main event. I had the NY Strip cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, but served warm. Tasted similar to meat cooked an hour ago which sat under a warming lamp; similar to a buffet. Don't get me wrong, the meat tasted dry aged, but the temperature of the meat threw me off. \n\nService was generally okay, except when my party asked for another set of complimentary fries, we got rejected and was told..$6 please. I expected more from a place that sells $50-75 steaks. \n\nI really wanted to like this place because of the brand and reputation, but unfortunately...I've experienced better."

            "review": "First off, for those that are confused - the Steaks at this restaurant do not actually strip, nor is this a strip club although there are several poles in the area which some guests seem to enjoy climbing onto.\n\nAnyway, when you enter this palace, you're initially greeted by a waiter who while nice, has just enough condescension, and general annoyance at your hopefully great (and perhaps alcoholically induced) mood, to let it show. That's the first mistake. These guys are not fun. They're here to give you their song and dance on their Steak and other assorted bits and pieces. You better pay attention.\n\nAnd so they do...\"First, we spank the Cow for 30 days, until she is good and angry, and then we marinate her in a garlic olive oil arugula salad, while poking her with a pitch fork in a tub of fat-reduced sherry chutney, on top of a mound of butter farmed by orphans in Canada\"...ok, not exactly but that's what it sounded like to me. It's actually hard not to laugh at how serious they take their ridiculous and unnecessary explanation. And I think that I did. And that made our guy a little upset. Just something not quite elegant about all these little details. \n\nAnd then you see \"Lobster Fritters\" on the menu and you come full circle with the classless mess that is Stripsteak, where my fondest hope was that the Cow would indeed disrobe at the end of the story.\n\nThe Lobster Fritters (I personally did NOT order them) were ok. Kind of tasted like from frozen, but better quality than Weight Watchers. They come with Creme Fraiche so if you're looking to die of heart disease before your 30 lbs of red meat, this is the appetizer to get.\n\nOysters were also just ok. Not fishy but just not great. And for 15-20 bucks, they should have been. Great, that is. They also only carry Kumamoto I believe, or some other mini Japanesey thing. Dude, Steakhouse - we need man Oysters here. Save these for your fake Sushi bar in the center of the hotel. (and they need it)\n\nSteaks do NOT come with condiments, so for a 50-60 dollar steak, assume another 20-30 bucks in potatoes and/or veggies. I had the scalloped something or other which was all in all - gross.\n\nThe Steak (Rib) itself was good. Was it 60 dollars good? No. But one of the better things to eat at Mandalay and that's not saying much.\n\nThey also keep trying to push their stupid fake Kobe beef on you. Man - it's not KOBE. Kobe beef is made under stringent and incredible conditions in Japan and Americans won't let it in the country, as I hear. This is American FOBE. So don't get sucked in. The cow did not drink any beer before getting massaged, and tattooed like they do in Tokyo. \n\nThe other thing we noticed is that its the busboys, both here and at China Grill, that do the place justice from a service perspective. Our busboy (busman really) - Victor, was awesome, fun, polite, respectful and free of that ever present Vegas-condescending, elitist attitude that is spread around the hotel, and inhaled by most staff members.\n\nIf you need to have Steak at Mandalay, go here if you don't want to walk for 4 minutes to Charlie Palmer at the adjoining 4 Seasons. Otherwise, walk on by"

The trio of fries made in duck fat are insane!  The duck salad was okay, good if you're a duck fan.  My fiance was talked into getting the filet.  It was cooked perfectly, nicely crusted, and very tasty.  One of the best I've had.\n\nService was very good here too.  Our waiter obviously loved the place and it showed in his work.  \n\nSo, I'll be back."

This is a high end Steakhouse with a modern twist, the prices are very high as you would expect from any top rated restaurant, but the quality of food and service is marvelous. The wine selection is abundant, with recommendations for any dish you may be having, and the appetizer selection and preparations are amazing. The meat and top grade ingredients they use to prepare the meals you can instantly taste upon your first bite, the steak quality is among the finest I have eaten. As mentioned previously, the price is on the higher end of the scale, plan to spend between $100-$120 per person for the dinner service without tax and the service charge included.  Overall, it was just a pleasure to sit and enjoy a high quality meal in a very beautiful and relaxing environment, positively recommend."

            "review": "Cow done right.\n\nYet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  Yet another dozen visits in that time.  StripSteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of Vegas' top steakhouses.\n\nThis is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  Japanese A5 is back.  Although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  As good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  Tip:  Do not order more than 6oz.  The richness will fill you up very fast.\n\nUp next, the American Mishima wagyu.  Running A3 - A4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  The fat is nowhere near as sweet as the A5 but still plenty good.  Opt for the rib cap if available.  It has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.\n\nAn Australian wagyu offered as a tomahawk is very good.  To be shared (even if the bartender tries to tell you you can eat it by yourself - eyes bigger than stomach - epic fail).  A step down in tenderness but if beefy flavor is what you want, good balance.\n\nFinally the angus beef.  If you love American style beefy flavors, it's ahrd to pass on the UDSA prime flat iron.  A true butchers cut.  Packs mineral, beefy flavors.  Good chew and nicely integrated fat.\n\nAll steaks (except the A5) have a very good sear, cooked to temp, with a very even core.\n\nSauces and toppings if you must; foie gras butter is liquid crack.  Talk about richness with the distinct livery flavor of the foie.  Pairs beautifully with the bitterness from the wood burning grill.  Note:  do not add this to the Japanese A5 unless you want a heart attack.\n\nSides are meant to be shared.  Do not pass on the truffle mac and cheese, baked potato with bacon marmalade, or bone marrow topped with a matsutake chimichurri (the tiny bits of matsutake add an unmistakable umame finish).\n\nBouncing back to starters, three true standouts, the Mina classic foie with roasted pineapple, brioche, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, the braised oxtail French Onion soup, and the steakhouse staple, classic wagyu filet tartare.  All taste as good as they read.\n\nService is practiced and polished.  Very knowledgable.  Steakhouse friendly.\n\nThe wine program remains strong though somewhat lacking in vintage depth.  Many great choices.  Vegas resort pricing.\n\nRaising the bar once again for the top tier steakhouses in Vegas."

First, we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation because of all the UFC 100 traffic.  However, the hostess seated us promptly at a lovely side table.  After taking drink orders, our server brought us a potato focaccia on the house and it was soft, fluffy and so good!  But after just a couple of bites, the server returned with a trio of duck fat fries, also compliments of the chef.  On our visit, he sent over truffle fries with a truffle sauce, bbq fries with a bbq sauce, and garlic/herb fries with a herb ketchup.  All amazing.\n\nFor our entrees, we got the ribeye and the kurobuta pork.  First, the portions are enormous!  The pork came with collard greens and creamy grits.  It was all delicious.  Oh, and the ribeye!  It melted in my mouth!!!  We also had the truffle mac and cheese, corn with jalapenos, and creamed spinach.  Way too much food but it was all so tasty.\n\nAlso, unlike other posters, we received nothing but friendly and attentive service.  From the hostess to the sommelier and waiter, everyone was eager to make our experience.\n\nThis was one of the best dinners I've ever experienced.  Ever.  Do try it out when you have the chance.  You won't regret it!"

Instead of bread, we were given complimentary duck fat fries trio: truffle oil fries, garlic herb fries and Cajun fries with truffle aioli, ketchup and Cajun sauce. Amazing! I had to tell my family the truffle fries and truffle aioli weren't good so I can have them to myself. \n\nWe had a wagyu filet, wagyu rib eye, wagyu rib cap, spinach, corn, potato pur\u00e9e trio and beignets with trio of sauces. Trio trio trio everything!\n\nMaine Lobster Fritters:\n3 lobster fritters with bacon. You wrap the fritter in shiso leaf and remove the skewer then dip the fritter in the meyer lemon creme fraiche. The bacon and shiso flavors were so strong, I couldn't taste the lobster. 3/5\n\n8oz Wagyu Filet, 8oz Wagyu Rib Eye and 8oz Wagyu Rib Cap:\nDelicious, tender, juicy and simply seasoned beef. All cooked medium-rare so you can enjoy the taste of good steak without the shenanigans. Each wagyu is about $70-75 but is worth it. 4.5/5\n\nCreamed Corn and Creamed Spinach:\nThe corn has jalapeno so it has a bit of a kick. The spinach has bacon streusel so it has a smokey flavor to it. 4/5\n\nPotato Puree Trio:\nPureed potatoes three-ways: horseradish, lobster and sour cream and onion. The best one of of the three was the sour cream and onion then the horseradish and last was lobster. I wish the lobster potato puree has bits of lobster in it...it just seemed like a very thick lobster bisque that needed more oomph! But overall, this trio was nice and creamy. 4/5\n\nBeignets:\n6 beignets. We got the trio of sauces: Macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding, vanilla creme brulee and chocolate pot de creme. I wasn't sure why they called it \"sauces\" since the creme brulee and pot de creme were oh-so thick to be dipping sauces. The only sauce I used to dip the beignets in was the butterscotch pudding which really tasted like alcohol. I had to eat the creme brulee and pot de creme as individual desserts.  The beignets were perfect. Warm, light and a bit fluffy. 4/5\n\nService was good and we made it to our show right on time."

All these thoughts melted away, however, when the complimentary duck fat fries arrives. Three uniquely seasoned fries with accompanying sauces. They were perfectly crisp and delicious. I ordered al a carte and has the Foie Gras sliders to start. Great little sliders with a generous amount of sweetness from peach preserves and the foie was perfectly cooked. For my main I had the American wagyu ribeye cap. This steak was fatty and delightful in only the way waguy can be. It blew my mind and while I think of myself as an accomplished steak eater, this 8oz portion was nearly too much. Its richness and lush flavor was enhanced by the way stripsteak cooked it. For a side, we shared their mashed potatoes- three ways. They were extremely rich, but oh so good! \n\nMy better half enjoyed the 3-course predetermined menu. He had no complaints other than his truffled mac and cheese was much too truffle-y, which I agreed. \n\nStripsteak is pretty typical Las Vegas steakhouse. No real surprises, but they provide consistent high caliber steaks night after night. The prices are high and there's no way to get around that. If you dine there, I recommend splurging on American kobe. Its not much more expensive than their prime and the steak you will receive will be an experience all in of itself."

            "review": "Stripsteak, a steakhouse brought forth by the all-powerful Michael Mina, is rightfully located in the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino as the perfect Sin City restaurant. \n\nWhy do you ask? Stripsteak is a vegetarian and Kosher eater's hell, but to a carnivorous foodie, it is simply the Garden of Eden. It's a place where giant haunches of beef are hung up to age in a wall-to-floor ceiling glass case, not unlike a display at a natural history museum chronicling the stages of decomposition, or rather, the stages to one delicious steak. \n\nAnd the food, oh, the food. As I write this, my mind is wandering back to the memories from that deeply satisfying meal. \n\nFirst, I had the trio of duck fat fries--each fry was a dream, with a shatteringly crunchy, smoky shell and a fluffy interior. My friends and I fought over the truffled fries and light garlic aioli especially, but the BBQ dusted fries and the original were stellar as well.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, we also ordered their spinach souffle, as an attempt in incorporating some vegetables in our meal. The state-of-the-art souffle was placed on the table by the server with great care as to not deflate the impossibly high, cloud-like confection. Then, he took it to a even higher level by pouring a luxurious Parmesan cream sauce from a dainty saucer. Just as the Fairy Godmother transformed Cinderella into the belle of the ball, Mina transformed the dowdy spinach into a classic French beauty.\n\nBut even the beauteous spinach souffle couldn't hold a candle next to the Rib-eye, for that steak has been through rigorous training. First, it begins its epic journey in the aging room, where's it's kept in a moisture and temperature controlled room to slowly mature for a month. The chef then trims the the sides of beef with an expertise not unlike a plastic surgeon to remove all unsightly dried bits and excess fat before portioning it into perfectly formed steaks. The next step is crucial: the steak is then poached in butter. A big no-no in the Kosher community as they forbid the fraternizing of meat and diary, but in my world, a big OH YES. For the finishing touch, the Rib-eye is then charred in their 1,000 degree grill for that deep smoky sear. \n\nThe best part was that the steak came to our table au naturale. With steak this juicy and well-seasoned, there's no need for A-1.\n\nIt's impossible to fall into a deep food coma coming out from a meal there, but it's oh so worth it. A definite must-eat destination for my next Vegas trip!"

Our group of 4 was making its way through Mandalay looking for something tasty. As we made our choice, we were seated promptly. Now since this was over 2 years ago, I don't remember every detail of the meal, but I remember liking it overall. I don't think our guests were as pleased, but I don't remember exactly why. I do remember my date got a shashimi plate that he loved. \n\nFast forward to January 2010, on a family trip to Vegas we needed a nice place to take the parents that wasn't too \"scary\". Since we knew StripSteak was mainly \"meat and potatoes\" we thought it was fitting.\n\nWe started with drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. One of my favorite things to do is to find a well-stocked bar and order all my favorites. First, a French 75. The bartender was so tickled that he got the chance to whip out his cocktail book and make it for me. It was delicious. Next, was a Ramos Gin Fizz, which contains egg whites. It is very hard to find a bar with egg whites. Once again, he told me he loved the challenge. It too was delicious. \n\nWe were seated in almost the exact same spot we were 2 years prior, which I found amusing. Our waiter was a tad arrogant who at one point told us the kitchen was slammed so if we didn't want to wait forever for our food, we should order right away. I thought this was so out of line. The whole time he stared at us like we were just \"dumb kids\" visiting from some BFN town dragging our parents along with us. By the end of the meal I couldn't stand him.\n\nThe food overall was good. I was pleased with the assortment of duck fat fries that was delivered to our table, complements of the house. I love anything cooked in duck fat and was very pleased. The bread brought out was also so delicious. I don't claim to be a typical woman who \"loves bread\" and I don't think it is a requirement of every restaurant on the planet, but when its good, it is so appreciated. I started with a duck confit, poached egg and frisee salad. I am not usually a fan of frisee but since the dressing, duck and egg was warm it wilted the frisee to a perfectly edible point. Unfortunately, the salad was way under-seasoned and craved salt. Next I had a Kobe beef filet, rare, and the goat cheese gratin. The beef was wonderful, tender, rich and decadent. The gratin too was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it! \n\nOverall, based on both trips I think its overall good, but not great. I think next time I want to try Wolfgang's Cut."

The service was surprisingly good. Now, I'm gonna sound like a girl-hater, which I'm not...mostly...but our waitress was beautiful and booby, but instead of some Hooter's clone-bot, we were treated to some damned personable, knowledgeable service! She was attentive without being overbearing, and cheerfully shared her choice items from their menu.\n\nPricing knocked me a little off my grandpa rocker, especially since in scanning the wine list, I could only find two $40 bottles of wine, with the most expensive being $28K. Instead, we opted for cocktails, which were spot on!\n\nEvery table was brought a trio of duck fried french fries with dipping sauces. A perfect opener to a delightfully debaucherous dinner. Steak was prepared exactly as we requested. Also worthy of note: my co-worker is a meat snob (which doesn't mean she's NOT a slut, because on the contrary...) and she was, in rare form, impressed. Our sides - the onion rings and truffle mac 'n cheese - were also noteworthy, but, unfortunately, we could only have a few spoon fulls of the mac since it was rich and creamy (probably better to order when dining with a larger group).\n\nOverall: a superb experience, but be prepared to shell out the dough."

It comes in a skillet and is good.  The aparagus and bake potato sides were like most steak restaurants, expensive and huge, but good."

            "review": "I'm unsure if the current drool on my shirt stems from a salivary gland disorder, or from reminiscing of my meal at stripsteak this past weekend. \n\nEither way, Michael Mina's STRIPSTEAK offered one of the best meals i've ever had and will forever be a MUST while in Vegas. Each meal is started off with a trio of Duck Fat Fries, compliments of the Chef. Duck Fat Fries are french fries which are fried in duck fat , seasoned three different ways and served with three dipping sauces. These are easily the best french fries i've ever had are deserving of the 5-star rating alone. \n\nCollectively, our group ordered the Japanese A5 Filet (market price of $95), a few orders of Salmon ($35), the American Kobe Burger ($25), and additional sides of duck fat fries and the truffled mac and cheese. While the prices are high, this is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for.\" We were told that the A5 filet was flown in from Japan earlier that morning, and upon receiving it, was tender enough to cut with a fork alone.  \n\nThe Salmon, cooked and seasoned perfectly, was extremely fresh. Having eaten at places such as Neptune's Net on Pacific Coast Highway in California, I didn't think it was possible to taste a fresher tasting fish, but Stripsteak really nailed it. When served with a side of truffled Mac & Cheese, which might i add was some of the best i've had the pleasure of trying, it was truely an adventure for the taste buds.\n\nOnto the burger. The American Kobe Burger was the least expensive of the various options. It featured a kobe beef patty cooked to a perfect medium served on a bun with fennel slaw and watercress. What was without a doubt the best burger i've ever had was served alongside a second helping of the succulent duck fat fries I had experienced at the beginning of our meal. \n\nOverall, i was very pleased with the meal as well as the amazing service and I didn't hear a single complaint in our party except regarding the price. But like I mentioned earlier, \"you get what you pay for.\" Unless of course you were the one ordering the $95 A5 filet... That should have come with a lapdance."

The skirt steak was not seasoned properly and the foie gras was way too rich. I also had the ice berg salad, which was $20 I believe, at that price I would pass next time- it was nothing special. On the bright side, the service was great and they do give a parting gift of popcorn. I won't be returning unless I am forced to eat here again."

Cucumber Martini (6)\nI thought it was a well prepared martini, but I'm not sure cucumbers belong in a martini. A little too savory for me.\n\n$23 Foie Gras Sliders, Peach Chutney, Basil (8)\nIf you like foie gras, these are a great alternative to typical sliders. Very well executed and the dipping sauce, whatever that was, was so rich. My only complaint would be that the foie gras should be a little bigger for the size of the bun. \n\n$12 Trio of Duck Fat Fries (8)\nUp there with some of the best fries I've had. They were think, crisp on the outside, and made with real fries. Only DB Bistro's were better. The middle sauce was the best and the other two were just average.\n\nWe ate at the bar and it's a great place for a quick bite and a couple drinks."

The complimentary french fries were crispy and delicious and my favorite of the three dips was the truffle sauce. The focaccia bread was quite tasty too. I had the the recommended Pear Martini that was a disappointment but our wine selection made up for that hiccup. \nThere were 4 of us and when we ordered appetizers to share. We had crab cakes, Alaskan king crab legs, fritters, all very tasty. Everyone had a \"steak\" entree and everyone was very satisfied with their choices. I had the Prime and it was very good though I couldn't finish it.. Our sides were mac and cheese (delicious), scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and caramelized onions (scrumptious) and the shitake mushrooms (ugh too salty). The biggest highlight was our Rocky Road dessert. Fancy ice cream sandwich, I could have picked it up and ate it all but it was also a shared dish.  I'm glad I came here but with so many other choices I don't think I will be back."

After days of walking around Vegas and taking in everything it has to offer, I was a big fan of the chairs in the dining room - soft, and arched perfectly for dining comfort. \n\nWe were big fans of the amuse-bouche that started dinner, fuji apple salad was unique and tasty, steak was perfectly prepared, and sides were quite good - although I must say the au gratins were a little hard to get out of the serving dish based on the way they were prepared. Regardless, the sides were excellent additions to the meal. Service was prompt, waiter had great knowledge of the menu, and though a noisy restaurant, it was not difficult to hear my fellow diners.

We were staying on the complete opposite end of the strip, so we are lucky to have made our way down here!\n\nDespite the $50 gift certificate, we had no illusions of a cheap meal. We had checked out their menu online and were prepared to pay. Which is a good thing!\n\nWe had a reservation on Friday night, and were promptly seated when we arrived. The wait staff was on it! While we had a main waitress, there were several others around who were quick to fill our wine glasses or remove an empty plate. \n\nIt didn't take long for us to order as we both new we were having steak. I ordered the Filet Mignon (medium rare) and my husband the New York strip (medium) with a lobster tail. We also ordered a side of Mac 'n Cheese and Spinach. \n\nBefore our meal, they brought out a sample of their duck fat fries. They were good, and we were presented with three varieties paired with a sauce. I'm not sure I would order them again, only because the rest of the food was amazing!\n\nOur steaks were cooked to perfection! Cut with a fork they were so tender! While the two sides were way too much for two of us, they were a great accompaniment. We savored every bite!\n\nWe also ordered a $90 bottle of wine. That is way more than we usually pay for wine (in fact, this whole meal was more than our biweekly food budget!), but it was awesome. Unfortunately we both drank too much of it to remember the name! Bottom line- just let them pick the wine. They won't disappoint!\n\nWhile it was not needed, we indulged in the marscapone cheesecake. WOW. A perfectly light end to a great meal!\n\nOur total bill was about $350. Typically I would have been struggling to breath at that price, but not this night. Maybe it was the wine that had relaxed me, but I woke up the next morning still feeling good about the money spent. \n\nExcellent food, great service, we'll be back in 5 years when we can afford it again!"

Well it was a nice place, but nothing too superb to be honest.  But its your Bday, so you just enjoy the flow of drinks and after enough everything taste good, Right?  We did get complimentary duck fat fries, which we will say was good and different.  That was the special appetizer the chefs prepared that night.  Our waiter came by and recommended some great drinks I will give him that.  We started with some martinis, and then I was having drinks on the rocks!!!!  \n\nAs the drinks were flowing steadily, we then ordered our food.  We had the bone in ribeye, which you cant go wrong, and also the kobe beef ribeye, yes \"kobe ribeye\" supposedly is very buttery and just melts.  Needless to say, they tasted the same it seems, but the sides is what we enjoyed.  We ordered the truffle mac n cheese, roasted mushrooms, and brussel sprouts with bacon.  I think anything with bacon is already a positive.  Its a Bday dinner so no reason to just enjoy and not try things right.  I would say this is a good place for a evening dinner with friends maybe better to be at the bar and grab more drinks and apps, than so much dinner per se.  \n\nIf you are in the mood for steak, there are probably other places that may be better.  Steaks are okay, nothing to go crazy over.   Next time, heading to Red Square and getting lit first then come over here, it may make the steak taste better....Just a thought."

I know i know, why would u even order fish at a steakhouse, right? but hey, i still think that if you're going to charge people that price, at least make it LOOK good, even if it doesn't taste good. \n\nThe presentation for each dish was kinda boring."

Drinks and appetizers were delicious. Truffle Mac and cheese is definitely worth the calories. I dont eat steak so I'm not the best person to review. But the fish dishes I tried were good and really fresh fish. Only thing I was disappointed in was the desserts. The so-mores were way to sweet (but my coworkers loved them) and the sorbet was just nasty favors to me and others at the table agreed."

I keep having to downgrade all my 5 stars because no nice restaurant in vegas is consistently good! \n\nWe chose to dine here to celebrate getting engaged... our last experience was so amazing I thought surely we would be in for a treat again.\n\nWe sat in the bar area again (as we did last time). There were 4 other couples dining (total of 5 tables of 2). As soon as the waitress realized we were only ordering about $200 worth of food , she gave up on our table. I ordered a martini that sat on the bar for 22 minutes before she brought it to me! Thanks for the lukewarm drink b*tch. My water was NEVER refilled until I finally had to chase her down and ask her to. She was rude, never smiled and it was obvious $200 doesn't deserve service to her. \n\nKobe tartar.. stil incredible. Foie gras sliders now use peach and came served cold. I prefer my seared foie gras served warm, but I do realize room temp is considered \"good\" to some, so I can't faul them. Steak was still awesome. \n\nSide of mac and cheese had broccoli in it. My fiance and I hate broccoli.. seriously put that in the description if you're going to try to put gross healthy stuff in my fatty mac and cheese dish!\n\nLuckily I still love the food.. but being completely ignored by a waitress and staring at your warm martini sitting on the bar for over 20 minutes is unacceptable. Our special night was still enjoyable, but good service would have reallly made the difference!"

I have eaten at many fine steak houses all over the country (Peter Lugers, Mastros, Burns, etc.) and I can say without reservation that everything was great at this restaurant (side dishes, appetizers, wine) except the STEAK.  I had the $52 bone-in ribeye and it was an outback steakhouse equivalent at best (and I may be offending Outback).  It took a long time to receive and was barely warm when it got to the table.  We had to send two steaks back to be reheated.  It was 30% fat, thin, and just not good.  I rarely leave negative feedback but just had to relate our terrible, terrible experience.  Consider carefully before wasting your money."

I ordered an American Wagyu rib cap that the waitress recommended  it was MP (market price) which was $80 for the steak and the half lobster was $25. The lobster was like getting a large prawn about 3 bites, quite a baby lobster for $25. I didn't not like the potato gratin that the waitress recommended it was a bit too rich in taste for me. \n\nOnly thing that was great was that you got three different kinds of shoe string fries that \nwere fried in duck fat with 3 different dipping sauces. This was complementary with order of a steak. \n\nThe steak was good but the size and quality for $80 was not worth it for an 8oz steak.\n\nMy total bill came to be $180 for one (this includes tip of 20% and tax)  I sat at the bar because I was in shorts and tshirt and flip flops. The service was more like a 15% but I felt generous and gave 20%. I don't know if it was because I was at the bar but for a $150 meal I felt service should be impeccable. I shouldn't have to ask for a receipt for my bill or be asked to be refilled on my ice teas. \nFor god sakes it's a high end steak restaurant.\n\n1. American Wagyu rib cap $80 (market price) \n2. Potato algratin $14\n3. Ice tea $4.00\n5. Banana fosters egg roll $14 \n6. Half baby lobster tail $25\n\nNot worth $180, maybe for someone who has ton of money and don't care but not for someone who works hard for their money. \nOnly reason I ate there was because mandalay bay casino gave me $200 in resort credit so I figure on last day having $140 left I go out with a bang. i might try again but I think I'll stick with an angus ribeye which  I believe 16oz and only $65. No sides next time since they come with duck fat fries and no lobster which was a size of a shrimp."

Melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nFor sides, we had the Potato Puree Trio, Spinach, and roasted mushrooms. The spinach wasn't anything special, but the roasted mushrooms were great. The potato puree was a little \"pureed\" for me, and maybe I had a little bit too much alcohol in me, so it didn't sit quite well in my stomach--but it was ok. \n\nFor dessert, we had a trio of ice cream (chocolate ice cream was amazingggg), strawberry shortcake (really good), a blueberry custard (this is good if you're not into anything overly sweet), and some sort of chocolate concoction. Wish I could describe the desserts better, but they don't have the dessert menu up. \n\nOverall, great place, good food, but it's pretty pricey, but I think the meal is well worth it."

Just some cold soup.  The salad was ok, but a tiny tiny portion.  However there was a silver dollar size of foie on it, tasted good, and a bit of lobster.  The only dish that was completely finished.  The wagyu eye was tasteless and kind of dense, although it was soft, but I didn't care for it at all, and the foie mousse was more like liquefied beef liver.  The dessert of beignets I actually asked for to go bc I could not stand being in there any longer.  The foie gelee you dip it in just tasted like fruit jam.\n\nOther things worth noting:\nWe had reservations for 6pm.  There were only a few tables in the place, but it took so long between courses for the plates to come.  We already informed our server that we had time constraints as we needed to be someplace afterward.  I left approx 7:30.  Took forever to get the bill too, which came out to $111 for the tasting menu and an order of oysters ($18 for 1/2 doz)  The oysters were ok but I can get those anywhere for much less.\n\nAlso the server was really annoying by always asking if we were done with a dish or not by saying \"are you still enjoying this?\" *rolleyes* If I was enjoying it, the plate would be empty.\n\nThe duck fat fries were the amuse buche.  They came out lukewarm.  The Old bay seasoned ones were way over the top salty.  Nothing special, they are just fries.  Don't see how the duck fat made any difference.\n\nThe music they play is terrible.  Who's that singer guy that was in the club scene in the first Nutty Professor movie?  \"This is how we do it\" song?  they played that.  Yes, that song.

Its fatty, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying, but If that's not enough for you, Stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz Porterhouse ($69). And for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping $85.  Might as well right...\n\nAnd we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides.  My faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese.  I would say that one side per person is about right, but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak.\n\nIf you're in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they'll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time. Oh and before you head over to Mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant.com for a $50 gift certificate.  \n\nBelow I have also included some eating instructions for you.\n\nAs soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction. \n \n1. cut your steak one bite at a time \n\n2. do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak (fat included)\n\n3. once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates.\n\n4. If they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out."

I wish they served them hot. \n\nI racked up $800 for 3 people and I felt the food was ok, but the service and the wine service and the bar service was slow, unprofessional and terrible. They need to hire a floor manager and a janitor for the bathroom. I firmly believe a night can be worth $300 a person, but the value and service needs to be there."

My wife had a beet salad which looked nice and a friend of mine split onion rings with the table.   The free fries were also amazing and we loved the different sauces.\n\nNext came the main courses.   My wife ordered a filet done perfectly.   My friends GF had the halibut which was also excellent.   I had the regular rib eye and the king crap options as did my friend.   Let me just say this steak was seasoned and cooked PERFECTLY.   The king crap legs that were the side were amazing.   They were split and all of the good parts were left.   A great addition! \n\nWe got the mashed potato sides  as well as a mushroom that was part of a forrest fire.   \n\nI think that this is a great steakhouse and a great place to eat.   I would highly recommend this place in LV."

They have a signature cocktail can't remember the exact name it was Apple something, but it was a great drink. Well mixed great flavor, to me it almost tasted like a green apple jolly rancher. I had the wagyu fillet mignon cooked medium and it was so flavorful and tender. This is a more upscale establishment, most people are dressed up. I don't think they would turn you away if you were a tourist in shorts but you can tell by the setting its a more dressy type place. The feel of the restaurant is very nice for dinner. It's a dim lighting with a small candle on the table. It's very open and transparent so you can see everything going on. Price is expensive, but the food and service and selection of steak and seafood truly warrants the higher prices. Oh and one last thing the duck fat fries are  in my top three fries I have ever had. This place earned its 5 star from me!!! We will be back. Also it does start getting  busy around 6-630."

I had originally communicated with the manager prior to coming down from our room, that we had an early show to catch so we couldn't afford to have our dinner served late.  So I sincerely appreciate that they were very accommodating and reassuring. \n\nAlbeit I liked the casual atmosphere, I still thought it was a tad bit loud for a nice sit down restaurant. \n\nWe started with three orders of duck  fat fries. Omg. And of yeah, it was on the house :)\n\nI believe three of the girls ordered Ribeyes for their main.  Ofcourse I had to take a big bite, definitely juicy and cooked medium well as I liked.  One ordered it medium rare and she was quite pleased.\n\nTwo ordered their lamb.  Cooked medium well,  moist and seasoned well. \n\nTwo of them ordered salmon and personally I thought it was a tad bit dry to my liking otherwise seasoned ok.\n\nMy scallops were seared perfectly and thus making the inside juicy and oh so yummy!\n\nOne of my weight conscious gf went with a Fuji  salad.  Definitely refreshing and made her a happy camper.\n\nThe side dishes we all shared-\nCreamed spinach- I was very disappointed how it was way too salty.  How can anyone mess this up :( And I am a creamed spinach gal! \n\nMushrooms- bleh. I don't like them personally but the group loved them.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed broccoli- ok.\n\nTo sum it up... Solid 4 stars. I suppose my expectations were really high for a 4 star $$$$ at over 700+ reviews restaurant. So I expect everything to be perfect even from as simple as their side dish, my creamed spinach.  \n\nBut great thing about rolling with high rollers is this entire dinner was covered on behalf of Mandalay Bay as credit due to one of my gfs.  \n\n#thats#how#Chel#rolls"

In Las Vegas there are so many amazing restaurants that they each need to compete to stay on top, or at the very least - relevant. I didn't feel that Stripsteak was even trying. \n\nThe decor made me feel like I was in a cafeteria. The way the tables were placed and the type of chairs they had looked like a food court in a mall or cafeteria. It wasn't impressive at all. The menu didn't have anything on it that really stood out to me either. It was a standard Steak House menu- which isn't something to complain about, since I love steak, but the steak I had wasn't even that good. - A little background on me- it takes a lot for me to dislike any steak. I love steak. This steak in particular was just BORING. It wasn't cooked Medium Rare- it was more on the medium well side- which is fine too, but when you're paying $50 for a steak it should probably be cooked the way you requested. It also lacked flavor. It was just blah. I never in my life had such an expensive boring meal. \n\nThe upside- the french fries. The different french fries that they bring to each table as opposed to bread are phenomenal- and also the reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1. \n\nI'm sorry to the Stripsteak fans, but for me Stripsteak is a massive let down."

The Angus was about as good as any I had tried, but once you try the Kobe, it just isnt in the same league.  We went for the American Kobe which was 70 bucks for the Filet, as apposed to the Japanese A5 Kobe which was 180 bucks!  And it was succulent and juicy, and almost caused me to drool as I chewed.  Unfortunately my wife liked it as well, so she eat most of it!\n\nService was excellent.  Immaculate servers, and most of them quite attractive.... if tall attractive women in skimpy outfits is your bag.\n\nI highly recommend this place if you are visiting the strip.

Let me repeat: price is no object (this place is off the charts expensive, and yes I do know its Vegas, and Mina's name is on it)\n \n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n \nAmbience/Atmosphere: 3.5 stars.  Big and open, with a very modern a sleek feel.  I found it a bit uncomfortable to be honest, but I guess not that bad for Vegas.  Has a cool bar, and the cocktails are very good.  \n \nService: 4 stars.  A tiny bit cold and service is a little bit snotty, but not to the point where it would bother you.  They know what they are doing and they are extremely professional.  They will not miss a beat at all, but I found overall they were very un-personable.  \n \nFood: 4.5 stars.  Mina has done it again with the food.  First off they brought us three little cones filled with french fries, with three dipping sauces.  Not a big fan of fries, but these were pretty damn good, cooked to a crispy light brown, they had the most flavor I think I have ever experience in a french fry.  I had a American Kobe steak tartar to start.  They prepared it table side, mixing the small pieces of chopped steak with 9 ingredients and spices.  This app was off the charts.  Probably a little too rich if you plan on having a steak for you main, but if you are going to go for an alternative or are just getting apps, ORDER THIS DISH!  The meat in the tartar could have been some of the most delicious steak I have had in a long time.  It literally melted in my mouth.  For entree I opted for the pork loin.  This dish was crazy good and I will have to say exceeded my expectations in every way possible.  If you are not going to order a steak for your main, I would seriously consider this as an option.  It had a bitter orange type sauce that was sooo good, and was perfect with the flavors of the pork.  Given time constraints we passed on dessert, so no comment on the sweets.\n \nWine: 4 stars.  First off Strip has a 5 star wine list, I am knocking it a star because it has no value.  Expect well over a double in mark up, and in most cases more.  The staff is well skilled on the list, which was a plus for me too.  If price is no object I would focus on some of the Bordeaux on the list, they have all the trophies.  But be prepared to put a big dent in the wallet.\n \nOverall:  Well this definitely is Mina in style.  He really knows how to create a food experience.  I have to say though, I would really struggle to recommend Strip to anyone, given that I don't think the experience really holds up to the prices.  I really have never had a problem paying a lot for dinner, but this was a little ridiculous.  Good luck, and happy dining."

We also inquired about the fries they serve at the tables, because we were starved after sitting there for about 45 minutes.

My boyfriend and I each ordered the salmon, which was okay, but definitely not worth the price or the wait.

The steak is first heated in warm BUTTER before it is grilled.   This process results in the richest, most tender, most flavorful steak I have ever had.  I'm sure the cut of steak we chose also helped, we both had the ribeye cap.  The cap is the ultra rich and soft outside layer of the ribeye.  The part that I normally save for last because I like it so much.  This is the only place I've ever heard of that serves just the cap.  It was amazing!   \n\nWe also had the foie gras sliders, the foie was great, but I thought that the other accoutrements took away from its flavor.

The first night my $61 medium rare filet mignon was perfect, and the half order of mushrooms ($8) was fantastic. The second night, my $63 ribeye was not nearly as flavorful as a ribeye should be, and instead of preparing it medium rare, it was light pink and a definite medium, leaning toward medium well. I was starving so I didn't alert the bartender until he came by a few minutes later. I didn't want a new steak at that point so I just paid for it anyway. Premium steakhouses need to be able to provide a flavorful cut of meat and cook it as ordered. I was seriously disappointed. I also ordered a half order of asparagus with a cucumber yogurt sauce as a side and it was okay but needed salt. And I rarely feel the need to add salt to a restaurant dish."

The drinks are a bit pricey like the $14 Cucumber Martini (alcohol is light, but the cucumber is very cool and refreshing). We started with a dozen oysters (very small, but the taste is very strong, very fresh). Our table all ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-in rib eye, medium rare (very well seasoned, juicy, melts in your mouth steak - couldn't get enough of it and at the end I kind of wished I had ordered the 30oz porterhouse instead). We got the roasted marrow bones on the side (bones were a bit smaller than what I had elsewhere but still good). For sides, we got the truffled mac and chees (this is a MUST - the truffle flavor is strong) and also the potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream/onion, horseradish) which went well with the steak but it was just okay. Service was helpful, friendly, and attentive."

You won't go wrong with the American Kobe beef burger or the American Kobe beef steak...they are a must have!!!  I can't wait till they are able to import the Japanese Kobe beef...that is what I am waiting for and definitely worth the wait, so I hear!!!  As side dishes, the spinach, asparagus, macaroni, mushrooms, scalloped potatoes are all good.  Like I said earlier, this is by far one of my fav places to dine out in Vegas!!!  I know that I will have an amazing experience every time!  The service is also amazing and they are on point with everything!"

            "review": "Tried multiple dishes at Strip Steak. But what can you expect as a pescetarian going into a steak house? I didn't eat the fries because they were fried in duck fat, but you could smell the truffle oil from the truffle fries. \n\nDidn't eat the duck bolognese or the \"instant bacon,\" but I could admire them from a culinary standpoint. Presentation of everything was wonderful. \n\nThe things I could eat though...\n\nThe beet salad with goat cheese was light and delicious. It needed a little bit more acid, but was still very well seasoned. \n\nThe truffle mac and cheese was absolutely scrumptious. As a side, it could easily feed two people because of how rich it is. \n\nThe trio of potatoe puree is a little odd, but still very flavorful. When given a fork to eat with, it's a little odd trying to get what are basically thin mashed potatoes into your mouth. \n\nGlazed mushrooms with shishito peppers and mirin reduction provided a nice Asian flavor and balance to all the richness of everything else. The peppers are smoky and sweet. \n\nI had the halibut entree which was tender and moist. It was cooked well, but underseasoned. It came with a coconut-red curry and sunchoke puree that didn't do much for the halibut. It needed salt. The curry overpowers the sunchoke so that you don't really taste much except a light hint of coconut milk.  \n\nThe aforementioned sides and dessert of bourbon infused custard saved the meal. This dessert looked odd, like a cr\u00e8me prior to being br\u00fbl\u00e9e-d. On top of it was a bourbon gelatin which, although delicious, were jell-o blocks of brown blobs. Then there was spun sugar and a whipped cream that I didn't care for, but the custard tasted so delicious, I finished the whole thing. \n\nOverall: nice atmosphere, good food, good service, my boyfriend says it was the best steak of his life, and I had a good time. There was a little wait in between the salad and the main courses, but nothing a good scotch can't take up. There's only one bathroom for men and ladies though so try not to get caught up in a queue."

The food was spectacular.  Will we be back? Absolutely! Was it expensive? Yes, but amazing food, great drinks and wonderful service comes with a price(that we'd gladly pay again!).  So what we ordered: Scottish Salmon, Filet, BLT Wedge and Gratin Potatoes. We would've had dessert but we were stuffed after our meals. All of our food was prepared to perfection!  Living in Seattle, we're treated to the best salmon. The salmon served at Stripsteak is right up there. My husband loved his filet which was delicious.  The Gratin with smoked Gouda was decadent. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the Gouda was so creamy and rich. The BLT Wedge was probably my favorite part of the meal. The bacon was amazing - crisp but juicy and the right amount of smoke. They also started is off with a trio of fries and dipping sauces which were a very pleasant and tasty surprise! And then they also sent us home with a treat of gourmet popcorn. The drinks were terrific too - I tried the cucumber martini which was lightly sweet and refreshing.  Our server Brian was fantastic. The service he provided was second to none. You can tell he loves his job and the restaurant which isn't all too common these days. Thank you for the wonderful dinner - we'll be back!"

We wanted a nice steak dinner that was located in Mandalay Bay so we wouldn't have to worry about rushing to the show. All and all it was an OK dinner.  The service was ok, a bit slow and it seemed like we had to find our server every time we wanted a drink. The complimentary trio fries were delicious, like many have said on here. I ordered the bone in rib eye, cooked medium and it was good.  My wife ordered the halibut and she said it was ok.  We shared the mac and cheese, which we enjoyed very much.  The baked potato was pretty darn tasty.   The ahi tuna and hamachi poppers appetizer were yummy. My wife and I both agree that we enjoyed the sides and appetizer more then the main entrees.  For drinks, we were also given a digital drink menu via ipad, which I thought was a great idea since drink menu's change so frequently. I ordered a Corona and my wife ordered the Cucumber Martini, which she absolutely loved.  I would rate this place at about 3.5 stars, but round up to 4 stars. For a $250 meal, we expected better service and food. I probably would not dine there again, since there are so many other places to eat that offer superior service and food."

The location worked great for me as a local because Mandalay Bay is close to the 215 and the actual restaurant isn't a long walk from the parking garage.\n\nThe duck fat fries with different sauces was a unique start to the meal and very good. The duck fat does give the fries a slightly better taste than the usual french fry. My filet mignon was awesome, very buttery and tender. Let's face it, the steak is the most important part of these restaurants and it exceeded expectations. My husband chose the wagyu and that was even better than the filet mignon. We shared the  pureed potato trio which was awesome. It was unique from the sides offered at other steakhouses and very tasty. One was lobster, one was horseradish and the other was sour cream. Of course we finished with dessert and that didn't disappoint."

If you want her in a happy mood, you take here to Stripsteak.\n\nWe sat in the lounge this time to get more of an intimate feel (I guess the birthday girl was in a festive mood) and it did deliver with getting a bit out of the limelight of the main dining area. We sat right next to the bar area which may have lead to the consumption of alcohol at random.\n\nFor starters we were given the fries and yes the duck fat fries. Those for some reason just always have me quacking up a storm. The dipping sauces that accompany it do seem to add a special dose of flavor to it, but I was not a fan of the house made ketchup. It just tasted a bit more tomato like then I prefer.\n\nAs the main event I went with the filet mignon and partnered that with the Mac and cheese and spicy pork belly rice. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and melted away once again with every bite. The highlight for me though is the Mac and cheese. It is well worth 3 hours every time and highly recommended. The noodles were soft and none overcooked which is a rarity. My favorite was the cheese though. It is not overloaded and just the gooeyness in each bite sends your mouth into a tailspin.\n\nI spend so much on the main courses that I've never sampled the dessert, but next time for sure. I must find a new reason to come back right?"

When I made the reservation, I mentioned we would be celebrating a friend's birthday - while this didn't result in a free dessert, there was a card on the table when we sat down reading \"Happy birthday\" (handwritten).\n\nHere is what we had:\n\n*Duck fat fries with trio of dipping sauces (complimentary) - seriously we could have stopped here because they were really really freaking delicious. All four of us loved the truffle aioli dipping sauce the best.\n*Rosemary bread (complimentary) - soft and very good, but perhaps a little unncessary because of the fries\n*Maryland blue crab chowder - course 1 of the prix fixe for 2 of the 4\n*Bibb Wedge salad - my prix fixe first course. It was the perfect size and had a good blue cheese flavor without entirely overpowering the whole dish.\n*Ribeye - course 2 of the prix fixe for two of the four of my group\n*Organic half chicken - my entree. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the truffle mac and cheese the chicken sat on was the perfect side, and the onion au jus gave the entire dish a good flavor.\n*Potato puree trio - order this for the lobster mash alone. You will thank me.\n*Beignets - 2 of us got the chocolate pot de creme and one got the creme brulee. The beignets were a good, light dessert to end an indulgent meal.\n\nService was outstanding. Our waitress was phenomenal - super friendly, helpful, and the right amount of attentive. Prices are what you would expect to pay at a good, upscale, fine dining restaurant. Our bill after using the $50 gc came to $313. It was worth every single penny.  I highly recommend checking out StripSteak when in Vegas."

Seablue, Nobhill, American Fish etc.  They're all at least 4 stars and sometimes more.  This past trip to Stripsteak was 4.5 stars.  \n\nI have been here at least 5 times and I always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  This isn't a top 3 steakhouse in Vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  \n\nWe've recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  They'll bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la Peter Luger style and that's what we do.  I also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  To me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  My wife loves the filet so I eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  We like it rare.\n\nThe sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  The spinach souffle is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  I don't think there's any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!\n\nWe went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        \n\nBut the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time."

I can not tell you how many times I've been disappointed by restaurants that tout their great service and even better food, then come away feeling despondent.\n\nHowever, this restaurant takes the proverbial cake, and a crap one at that!\n\nWhere to begin? After having been sitting at a table with my guest for 15 minutes, the waitress finally decided it was time to work. Realizing that she was indifferent, my guest and I ordered some red wine to numb the pain we knew lay ahead. When the wine came, it was as warm as the desert outside the hotel. Enduring this bit of pain, we decided to press our luck further.\n\nI ordered the Kobe steak which after about 40 minutes of wondering when my food would show up, came most disappointingly. Kobe beef, the most rarified and king of all steaks, prepared properly medium rare, came out well done. Well done! I was horrified to see such splendor squandered. I decided to take a bite and tasted charcoal. I was livid. I found my nonexistent, indifferent waitress and demanded to see the manager.\n\nA manager came round and apologized and brought me another Kobe steak, this time thankfully, faster than the last. When it finally arrived, it too suffered a cruel fate reserved only for witches in Salem. I spoke with the manager who brought out his manager. This new bloke apologized some more and took my meal off my bill. My bill? Yes, it seems I still had to pay for my guest whose food was only average. I feel that if one person's meal is ruined, everyone's is. Therefore everything should be taken care of. Sadly, Strip Steak doesn't think this way. Strip Steak simply doesn't think or cook for that matter. They can apologize well though."

Not the polish, but everything else, and it was probably my favorite because it was so good!\n\nI started with the prosciutto tart and while it was crumbly, it was light but still wowed me. to be honest, I was full by the end of having half of the tart. Those fries were seriously delicious! Why can't I buy those sauces anywhere?!\n\nI ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it was easy to cut and easy to love. It had a cheesy taste to it and was delicious.\n\nI tried two sides - the spinach souffl\u00e9 and the baked potato. The baked potato was like any kind of baked potato I've ever had. It was so smooth, but still a potato, with all kinds of flavors. The souffl\u00e9 had Parmesan sauce over it and it was very yummy. I personally liked the baked potato more than the souffl\u00e9.\n\nThe only downside was that we also ordered the mac n' cheese but never received it.

Our restaurant.com certificate ended up taking care of tip and tax, which is better than nothing, but I think I will be on the look out for $100 certificate next time. On our way out, the server brought us a small bag of caramel popcorn drizzled in dark chocolate. If we ever are blessed with a babysitter again, we will happily return."

            "review": "My 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!\n\nParties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.\n\n* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!\n\n* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. \n\n* Maine Lobster \"bacon-wrapped fritters\" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!\n\n* Roasted Beets \"burrata, walnut oil\" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.\n\n* Filet Tartare \"american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread\" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don't need or want the bread.  \n\n* Shabu Shabu \"american kobe beef, mushroom consomme\" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.\n\n* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \n\n* Mac & Cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - Yes, it's all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it's all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.\n\n* Scalloped Potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \n\n* Potato Puree Trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\n\n* Creamed Corn \"jalapeno\" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it's more creamy goodness.\n\n* Beignets \"Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee\" - Take a spoon to the cr\u00e8me brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\n\n* Coconut Candy Bar \"Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds\" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that's super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\n\n* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\n\n* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\n\nThe service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There's a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I've had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he's doing with his food and his staff.  It's no wonder there's a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don't have their own restrooms, so you're forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.\n\nMy suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it's harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You'll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!\n\n4.5 stars"

Meanwhile, our entire (now very hungry) party had to  to finish our drinks and find  a different restaurant .   Really,  the proper,  or classy move by the manager would have been to offer us the advertised happy hour menu and prices to make up for the mistake.

We were seated pretty quickly after since we had a reservation.  We got the french fries, herb, truffle, and paprika.  They were delicious.  Our waiter Heather was really friendly and an excellent server not too annoying but also helpful in making appropriate suggestions.  She even brushed it off diplomatically when one of the guys at our table hit on her.\n\nWe ordered some sides, the brussel sprouts with bacon, mac and cheese, and mushrooms (I wish I could offer more descriptive recaps but I was hammered).\n\nI ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it was perfect.  I've been to fancy steak houses before and this definitely makes the cut if you will as one of the nicer ones.  Some of the guys at our table ordered the Kobe cap steak which they also enjoyed.  \n\nThe filet was the right size, 10 oz and I wasn't able to eat it all after all the fries and other sides.  We got free gourmet popcorn which was a nice touch.  \n\nThe sommelier wandered around and we ordered an Oregon Pinot Noir which was nice and I took a to-go cup because I'm classy like that.  I wandered out almost with the glass and they offered me a plastic cup, ahhh I just love Vegas.\n\nThe setting is at once modern and accessible, not pretentious.  They showcase the steaks being aged which is a cool touch.  Seats in the dining room provide for a lively setting but don't go here and expect a quiet dinner.  \n\nEveryone from the bus boys to the servers to the hosts operate smoothly and efficiently.  Vegas has so many dining options these days which is a far cry from the buffet troughs of yesteryear."

The drinks at the bar were excellent.  I had a blueberry type martini and my friend had just her usual vodka soda.  We asked for some of the fries they give out since we were starving and they finally brought some after about 20 minutes and they were cold.  Still good though.  I struck up a conversation with another customer at the bar, discussing his wine choice.  We were seated at 9pm.  The customer at the bar followed me and yelled at me \"Are you just going to walk away?\"  I was a little freaked out by that, it was weird, but not the restaurants problem and he left right away.   Somebody brought more of the complimentary fries, a bit warmer than the last.  Male waiter took our order, food runner brought it, a half hour later, and we never saw our waiter again until he returned and spilled a glass of water all over my friend.  Service is simply awful here.  NO EXCUSE at this price point. I don't blame the service staff this is a management problem.  They are understaffed.  We know what you pay these workers.  Add a few more.\nThe food was excellent.  We each had a steak and shared the beet salad and the mac and cheese.  The food is worth returning for, but at that price you can get food just as good and impeccable service to go with it.  Think I will stick to the Wolfgang Puck restaurants where you get both."

He was extremely friendly and remembered our names even with a bar full of people!  \n\nOnce we were sat in the dining area, our waitress guided us through picking the perfect steaks and we were given complementary duck fat fries... Amazing! Best fries I've ever had.\n\nNow onto the steak.  Call me sheltered, but I honestly thought steak was steak. Boy, was I wrong!  The steaks were fantastic, cooked exactly the way I asked. No sauces needed. I didn't think steak could be so good.\n\nWhile some people may be put off by the fact that the sides are not included in the hefty price of the steak, they are family style and a very large portion.  We got the onion rings (skinny, crunchy, amazing) and the Mac and cheese (creamy, hint of garlic, and truffle) I know I've over used amazing... But, damn! What else can I say! I whole recommend."

Though the crab cake was delicious, the potato wedges were bland and service was average at best on a very busy night. To top off a regrettable experience, the tip was automatically included in the bill despite only being a party of two. Worse, this 18% tip was assessed inclusive of the sales tax instead of just the food & drink - a pet peeve and tricky practice of these tourist traps. In the future, I'll stick with Ruth's Chris or Morton's which are a comparative bargain."

The food prices just seem to be much more than back home in Canada, even after taxes. I understand the whole phrase \"go big or go home\", but at the end, is it worth it?\n\nStripsteak is located inside Mandalay Bay, which mind you is probably one of the largest hotels in The Strip...and one of the most poorly accessible from public transit. Good thing I was living in NYNY so I was able to take the tram there. The first thing you would've thought is that with the high prices, the restaurant would've been on the quiet side. Nope! It's about as loud as a Chinese dim sum restaurant on a Saturday afternoon; very loud.\n\nWe ordered the Japanese A4 wagyu satays, American wagyu vs. Australian wagyu, NY strip, and wagyu rib eye. Yeah I know, a lot of wagyu...I mean, you don't get wagyu in many places in Canada! As for the food quality...the two wagyu comparisons were interesting, but I certainly did not feel the value of $69 for all the wagyu foods, and honestly the $59 NY strip tasted a little better. However, this restaurant is definitely something I would recommend trying once if you're a steak lover, but not twice.\n\nService was great though. The server explained all our foods when we first ordered, and when they were being delivered one by one. We also got complimentary fries and different dipping sauces for each fries. Again, it's a restaurant I was glad I tried since I was able to experience a non-buffet higher end dining style in Vegas, but I wouldn't do it again."

I didn't eat the sliders, but my friend enjoyed. Salmi poppers were......weird. It was raw-ish salmon on top of fried rice cake with roe on top. I didn't really care for them too much. They weren't bad but wouldn't order again. The spinach and artichoke was tasty but very very pricey. The salt and pepper fries were WAY WAY too salty. All food items about are $7. They give 2 tiny brioche tarts with the spinach dip. 4 would have been better. Or at least 3. So, I'd definitely go back and get 2 hummus'. It was definitely my favorite.

Also, I had to ask if they had a prix fixe (knowing about it while researching the restaurant online beforehand) before he gave us the prix fixe menu. Not sure if that's normal or not. \n\nMaybe this is a conspiracy, but these guys serve duck fat fries seasoned 3 ways with 3 types of dipping sauces instead of bread. These thing are fantastic and most likely if you do not control yourself you will get full off these things. That's just my theory. Either way, out of a group of 7, 4 ordered off the prix fixe menu, one got the kobe burger, one a wagyu steak, and one the pork loin. Everything was cooked very well and tasty to boot. I had the 18oz bone-in ribeye off the prix fixe menu, along with the iceberg lettuce salad. The salad was surprisingly good. The steak was large and juicy. It also came with 3 seasonal side dishes served in individual serving plates. I also ate half of the kobe burger, which was very good as well. The rootbeer float dessert was also quite satisfying.\n\nAll in all, a very nice meal food wise at an upscale steakhouse."

Excellent quality food, remarkable service and while the prices were definitely Vegas-style (read: higher than usual) I still feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nAtmosphere is nice, up-scale, and very open.  You get a nice little view of the kitchen without it being a spectacle.  As I said the service was excellent.  The sommelier was friendly and helpful, and just added to the experience.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly, sociable and just helped make the meal that much better.\n\nThey start things off with some french fries that are cooked in duck fat.  They were light, crispy and very tasty.  You get three varieties which I believe were garlic herb, truffle and chipotle each paired with dipping sauces.  It's nice to see a restaurant take something simple and class it up a bit.\n\nFor an appetizer I had the bacon-wrapped lobster fritters.  I already knew that bacon makes everything taste better but I didn't know it could make lobster taste that much better.\n\nMy date had the spinach souffle with parmesan cream which she absolutely loved.  I had the bone-in rib-eye which was absolutely excellent.  The steaks here a first poached in butter and then cooked over a wood-burning grill.  I hadn't had steak prepared in this manner before but it was excellent, one of the more memorable steaks I've ever had.\n\nBig thumbs up for this place."

Our waitress was very personalbe and made the experience above and beyond.\n\nThe food was great. We both had different steaks, and both were amazing. \n\nThe only odd thing was I kept feeling a little water mist hitting my arm, I thought it was a lemon or something being squeezed but it happened a couple of times and I figured out it was coming from the ceiling. I notified the waitress to tell her manager so they could check it after closing before it got bad. She offered to move our table which we declined because it was so small it was no biggy, we just wanted to make sure they checked it before it became a problem. For this they bought us desert and sent us back to our room with candied popcorn and cheese cake. They didn't have to do this because the water was really no big deal, but that is just the kinda place this place is. The service was just that good.\n\nI highly recommend going here for a nice dinner. We will be back."

Instead of bread, you are greeted with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries with truffle sauce, homemade ketchup, and an aioli.  Those fries...seriously once I started I just couldn't stop eating!  The truffle sauce rich but so flavorful.  Next, we shared the 18 oz rib eye and the braised veal chop.  The 18 oz dry aged rib eye was simple, without the excessive spice mixture coating or butter drenching the meat, and yet so delicious that you could really appreciate the meat itself.  Cooked to perfection!  The braised veal chop fell right off the bone, however was on the saltier side.  To compliment these large slabs of meat was the star side...the truffle mac and cheese.  A blend of broccoli, macaroni noodles, and cheeses smothered in a coating of cheese (I think it was mizithra), this was the best mac and cheese I've tasted, and I couldn't stop eating it (yes it is a recurrent theme in this write-up).  I was so full after finishing my veal chop and mac and cheese that I couldnt make it to dessert, but I'll definitely be back for more.\n\nThe only cons is the atmosphere.  The decor of the restaurant appears cheap for a michael mina restaurant.  And, it's unisex restrooms!  Come on...at least have separate restrooms so I'm not avoiding urine on the floor on my trek to the toilet!"

            "review": "I had read some reviews citing poor service at Stripsteak due to what reviewers believed was a result of their servers writing them off as \"not going to spend much\"-type customers, even when the bill was in the range of $200 for two. Having read this, as well as the $110/person \"average check price\" listed on their website, I was somewhat concerned going in, given I had intended on trying the prix fixe menu at $55/person and arriving a bit earlier in order to get some drinks on their happy hour menu. However, I love steak and we were staying at THEhotel, so I really wanted to try an upscale steakhouse nearby, and Stripsteak sounded great for the price.\n\nWhen we got there, there was a slight wait even though we had reservations and the place was clearly empty (common restaurant tactic in order to drive patrons to wait/drink at their bar, which we did). It wasn't a problem as we were planning on trying some of their specialty cocktails on their happy hour menu anyway, and I had budgeted plenty of time for dinner before our Lion King show later in the night. We got to chat up two of the bartenders over a mojito and Stripsteak Sour. Drinks were okay; nothing out of this world. The bartenders were pretty outgoing, though it was obvious they were tired of hearing about what tourists had planned for their trips, even so, they continue to ask.\n\nI have to say, our waiter (Glen H) was awesome the whole night. He was extremely attentive, and we didn't notice any decline in service after we had ordered our meal. He answered questions on the menu items (which I always have at these type of places where they have fancy names for everything), and was around just enough but not too much.\n\nFood is served with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries, which were amazing. I ordered the prix fixe menu as planned and chose the salad wedge, prime rib, and root beer float dessert. My girlfriend ordered the Kobe burger with a side of duck fat fries (we didn't know we would be getting complimentary fries before we had ordered, and she really wanted to try them).\n\nThe meal was excellent. The duck fat fries were a perfect start and the prime rib was surprisingly filling (I got triple sides of mac n cheese as well lol). The root beer float was not my thing. To be honest, I'm not sure how different you can do a root beer float, so I found it somewhat uncharacteristic of this type of restaurant.\n\nAll in all, we kept the bill to $150, and that's with four drinks (a head's up, the specials go from $6 to $13 after 7pm, which I hadn't noticed before we had ordered our seconds). We even had leftovers, though I warn that duck fat fries do not taste good at all cold, so kill these at the restaurant (the fat begins to harden).\n\nI think the prix fixe menu served its purpose in wetting our appetite for Stripsteak. I would love to come back again soon. Nice bar, comfortable seating area. It was a near perfect dinner. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5."

My friend and I were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. Dana White and a group of UFC fighters were dining in the restaurant as well during the time of our visit. In fact I came pretty close to smacking the guy in the crotch when he walked by our table and I was in mid stretch. So yeah, as other have mentioned, the tables are packed pretty close together here. In addition to nearly smacking a guy in the crotch, the closeness of the tables also meant hearing a lot of other people's conversations. The nice older woman next to us started to tell some of the most expletive filled stories after a few glasses of wine. I did like that it was a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. My wrinkle free shirts hadn't stayed as wrinkle free as I would have liked in my luggage and being sort on time I put on a black t-shirt and tried for the Steve Jobs look. I thought I'd look out of place, but lots of people were dressed casually. \n\nOur server was in a bit of a rush at first. All of his tables were sat at the same time including ours, but later in the night, as things calmed down, he came over and chatted with us for a bit. The guy was right on with all his suggestions. The service was good overall. \n\nFor appetizers we had the lobster fritters and east coast oysters. The fritters were lobster wrapped in bacon, fried and served with butter lettuce and creme fraiche. You know anything made with that combination of ingredients is going to be good and it was, but it was just good. I'm not usually one to talk about the concept of a dish, but when I'm in a place like Stripsteak I am hoping for something unique. This dish didn't strike me as being anything that unique as much as it was a bunch of delicious stuff that got fried. We also received our complimentary fries and while they were all good, the one that really stood out was the truffled one.\n\nMy friend and I both had the bone-in ribeye as our entree. Hate to say it, but it was slightly overcooked. I kept cutting into it hoping it was just the char from the wood burning grill that made it seem less pink than a medium rare should have been, but my steak was mostly medium until I got very close to the bone. This was a shame since it was a very good cut of meat. My friend had his with foie gras and it was a great combination. He also had the chipotle scalloped potatoes recommended by our server and they were excellent. I went old school and got a baked potato. The overcooked steak was probably the biggest disappointment of the night.\n\nWe were both stuffed, but after such a heavy meal I wanted something sweet to end the night. We both went with the beignets. I had the one with chocolate, pudding, and Macallan 18. I'll eat anything with Macallan 18 in it. It was a decent beignet. A little bit denser than I would have liked, but probably done so because it was intended to be dipped into the pudding. Again, a good dessert, but nothing amazing. The best part was probably the Macallan. My friend had the same thing but with creme brulee instead of pudding.\n\nSo yeah, that was pretty much the story of the night. Good food and good service, but nothing we had really wowed me. My friend raves about his steak with foie gras, but it was his first time having foie gras so I guess we all remember our first time ;) I think the only item that was really memorable to me was the truffled fries."

It's a very little thing, but offering complimentary duck fat fries is fun and I appreciate something different. It was one of the selling points in addition to Michael Mina that attracted me here. \n\nLet's start with the good. The Wagyu rib cap was amazing and super tender. I'd recommend this steak hands down to anyone that dines here. The lobster fritters and wagyu satay appetizers were tasty too. They come in a set of three, which is kind of odd but maybe it goes with their theme along with the three types of fries and three dipping sauces that came with them. The Loup de Mer, which is an european seabass (skin attached), was worth ordering as well.\n\nThe not so good. I kind of wish the fries came in a more timely matter. If they came before we finished ordering, that would've been more appropriate. There were just too many different servers for our table and it just felt out of place. They had someone walking around with fries, then another person take our order, then another person who cleared our plates after the appetizers, then one of them came back to set up our table for dessert. Also, the timing of when all the food came out was out of sorts. The fries came a while after we ordered, but then it took even longer to get the appetizers out. I understand steak restaurants take a long time to get it right, but it felt inordinately long for the entrees even when the server said it was coming anytime now. I also could've went without the potato puree and spicy zuchinni side dishes, just didn't seem to put much effort here. The cuts of the zuchinni were amateurish imo. \n\nI would be extremely happy to come here for a cup of water and their wagyu steak."

This is kind of a splurge restaurant, both dollar-wise and calorie-wise, and I say calories be damned when in Vegas.  Just spend an extra hour in the pool the next day.\n\nI got the 18oz ribeye, and it was terrific.  I'm not sure if the kitchen is preparing the steaks with anything else besides salt & pepper, but my steaks at home never taste this good.  The thought of sauce never crosses your mind as your eat your steak.  The sides here are EXCELLENT.  We got the creamed corn, the potato gratin, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, and mushrooms.  I couldn't pick a favorite if you put a gun to my head, because they were all so dang good in their own way.  The creamed corn is slightly spicy, and the kernels are still firm when you take a bite, instead of all mushy.  The potato gratin is definitely more like a potato lasagna (as to aptly described by the famous Phil T), so don't even try to scoop it with the spoon they give you.  Grab a knife and go to down on that bad boy.\n\nThe service was good, and I never had to ask for more water, as they were constantly keeping an eye on us and stopping by.  Baby C was such a trooper & well-behaved during the meal, so we got the ice cream trio & the buttermilk citrus scoop was pretty amazing.  You're gonna land on somewhere around $100 per head, and they recommend reservations, which you can easily do by phone."

            "review": "Is this place a joke? Buying dinner here is like buying knock-off's at designer prices. I've heard rave reviews of Michael Mina so frankly I am shocked at the blatant ineptness of this kitchen. It was embarrassing to be shelling out so much money for how consistently shitty each entree was. When we walked in, the hostess hesitated to put our names on the waiting list and recommended we go to Fleur instead. She said it is superb. We should've paid attention to her subtle warning. \n\nSo they give you complimentary fries as an appetizer. They were cold. How do you mess up french fries?! We started with a ceasar salad. It was bland and the anchovies had zero flavor. They tasted like they'd been thawed or soaked in water. They were certainly not fresh. Anchovies are supposed to be salty. The saltiness is essential to create the best flavor in the salad. At times I felt like running back into the kitchen and helping these chumps. I ordered the $40.00 salmon...I call it \"the $40.00 salmon\" because the only thing that stood out about it was it's price. I had to send it back. It was chalk dry and overcooked. It was disgusting. My boyfriend said I make way better salmon at home. We went to Norm's the following day, even Norm's makes better salmon. Like way better. Then they made me a new one and it was rare. I knew they simply don't know how to cook, no matter how many times I send it back, it's still going to suck and I like sashimi so I ate it. \n\nMy boyfriend's steak was, \"alright,\" (his words, verbatim). Our bill came out to $153.00.  We left the waitress, who spent most of the night gossiping with the other waitresses, 15%. Save your money. This restaurant blows."

Based on the good reviews on Yelp, Stripsteak became an addition to my Restaurant Week list of places to go.\n\nAmuse bouche:  Three containers of seasoned fries - garlic herb, truffle, and bay-seasoned.  There were three containers for dipping the fries one mustard and bay seasoned, truffle aioli, and ketchup.  Pace yourself here.  All tables are served the amuse bouche in lieu of a bread basket.  Since I was alone, I could have totally pigged out on these tasty fries.  5/5\n\nCourse 1:  Duck spring rolls.  Duck confit with sweet and sour cherry drizzle.  The duck was excellent and what a great appetizer.  5/5\n\nCourse 2:  OK, so I decided to get a steak.  It was the Kansas City strip steak with small sides of creamed corn and mushrooms.  The steak had a grilled small red onion and a yellow tinkerbell pepper.  The pepper is very mild.  The steak was grilled exactly as I ordered - black and blue. 5/5\n\nCourse 3:  Beignets and vanilla creme brulee.  Perfect ending to the meal.  I forced myself - yeah right - to finish the beignets.  5/5\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, when you get ready to leave, you're given a small bag of candy popcorn with the Stripsteak logo to take as a gift.  It will be a TV snack some night.\n\nMy server, Alexis, was always available and attentive.  When the two eating next to me left for a bathroom trip, she refolded their napkins while they were gone.  I noticed this attention to detail and good service throughout the night.  \n\nI was quite pleased to see the number of families with young, well behaved children.  There was a concert with someone named Selena Gomez at the Mandalay Events Center and thus the large number of children. Alexis had to explain to me who this Selena was.\n\nA great evening and another wonderful Restaurant Week experience!"

The sides we shared at the table were the baked potato ( which is very unique and hard to explain, but delicious),  the jalape\u00f1o cream corn, and the potato gratin.  Cream corn was very good, but to me that gratin still has me thinking about how good it was.  Wife finished her meal off with the beignets which were wonderful.  Not too heavy with good dipping sauces/mousses.  Fat boy tip:  the truffle dipping aioli/sauce from the fries. if you have any left,  save it and try it with a chunk of steak.  Magnafique!"

Good thing the food is excellent. \n\nAll kidding aside,  I love this place. One of my favorite stops in Vegas. I've been twice so far, and I plan to go back. First off, this place is currently on restaurant.com, so you can get a pretty good deal. I've tried both the ribeye and the rib cap. The rib cap is supposed to be their best meat they have, and it is rich and flavorful. However, I guess I'm a traditionalist and love my ribeye. It's very good here. The sides are incredible. I've had the mac and cheese, the trio of pureed potatoes (good!), and the creamed spinach with bacon. Also, the foie gras was very tasty and a generous portion. I tried the bone marrow for the 1st time in my life, and I just think I'm not a big fan of it.  As you must already know by reading the many reviews, they bring a complimentary trio of fries that come with special sauces. Oh, the truffles fries and truffle sauce... amazing. For dessert, I've had the marscapone cheesecake and the donuts. Both were very good. And they even give you a dark chocolate covered popcorn goodie bag to take with you.\n\nThe drinks are good too, and the service is great. Both times I came alone, and I felt very special. They are very accommodating.  \n\nGreat place!"

The sides that we ordered were truffle mac and cheese (really good), bacon cream spinach, mushrooms and the potato trio (yummy!). I also had the Apple crumble for dessert which was really big and pretty good. I've had better apple crumble but it wasn't bad by any means. The coffee was decent as well. Nothing to rave about, but nice to have at the end of your meal. Our server was slow on refilling our drinks and bringing the condiments we requested. The free fries at the beginning are such a nice touch and SO good. The meal will run your at minimum probably about $80 a person. Definitely worth the price though. Especially if your suite has a microwave or stove - take home the leftovers for steak and eggs the next morning! Oh, my husband had to lamb and said it was the best cut of lamb he's ever had but he didn't like the spices. The lobster was really good (although I don't think it was two pounds like they claimed) and the foie gras was really good to accompany your steak. You get a large peice for $19."

My husband ordered the skirtsteak and i took a bite of it, and savored the flavorful tenderness.  On a previous visit, he ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye and he claims that it was the best steak he has ever had.  On this particular visit, he wasn't very hungry, hence the smaller order.  Our friends ordered the ribeye and the filet mignon, and they enjoyed every bite.  They shared the truffle mac n cheese sides and the spinach souffle.  Everything was devoured.  In fact, we practically had to tear the truffle mac n cheese bowl away from our friend before he started licking it clean. \n\nI also did try the 3 types of complimentary duck fat fried french fries and the accompanying sauces.  The truffle dipping sauce was heavenly.  I am surprised that I was able to restrain myself the way I did.  \n\nThe food isn't the only thing calling my name... So is the House made ROCK N' RYE cocktail.  Holy sweet mother of Jesus! This drink is amazing. It consists of Wild Turkey Rye infused with Rock Candy, Citrus & Aromatics. The flavors are melded together for 30 days before it is poured over one giant ice cube.  This alone is a 5 star cocktail.  I can't wait to return and have a whole glass to myself.  Or maybe even two. \n\nReservations are a must! Be warned- it is quite loud at this restaurant.  It was a little difficult to have a conversation without leaning in to hear, but it is definitely a fun atmosphere.

I think people get too caught up in the atmosphere and alleged reputation of places to form an honest opinion.   You ever see those shows where they swap the food at a fancy restaurant with some take out and people still think the food is fabulous and the best they've ever had?\n\nThis place was just average.  When I say average I mean average compared to comparable steakhouses.  It was by no means near the quality of Sizzler but far from  what I would expect for the price I paid.  The Caesar Salad was terrible.   The side dishes were actually pretty good, I had the scalloped potatoes.  I ordered a Kansas City Strip Steak.  It was OK, somewhat flavorful but was still missing that \"wow factor\".   I was a bit disappointed considering the price.  You don't always get what you pay for.  My rating of 3 stars is being very generous.\n\nI've had a better steak at BJ's, yes BJ's!  Try their New York Strip with Bleu Cheese Garlic Butter.  Very good!"

We started with some appetizers and wine by the bar because dinner had not started yet and were pleasantly intrigued with what else they had to offer.\nWe ordered the oysters and the foie gras sliders with pear compote.  Two of our very favorite foods and both were spectacular! We had to stay for dinner.\nWe were moved to the dining area where we both had the waygu Japanese rib eye med-rare of course.  It was perfectly prepared on their wood burning grill and went perfectly with the truffle mac and cheese (not the best MnC ever but still mouth watering).\nWe were served complimentary duck fat fries with a trio of dips and bags of caramel popcorn at the end.\nCan't recall the wine we had but after stuffing our faces we were the last passengers to board the last flight out to LA scampering into the plane buzzed and satisfied. 15 min later our luggage was loaded and we took off--I'm sure we got some dirty looks for the extra lag but the food coma had set in and we were knocked out.

Being one of the birthday peeps, I was a little hesitant to celebrate the big 3-2 at a restaurant on the Strip.  However, my buddies assured perfection, and boy were they right!  First, let me start by saying that restaurants on the Strip are notorious for terrible service.  However, the service at Stripstreak was some of the best I've ever received.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order the steak tartare for an appetizer.  Trust me.  For the main, most of the table ordered a filet instead of the larger steaks because we were heading to XS later, and let's face it - dancing while in a food coma is no fun.  The filet's came out perfect, and each had a nice char on the exterior while maintaining that familiar medium-rare reddish/pink interior.  The sides were equally impressive:  truffle mac and cheese, potatoes 3 way, duck fat fries, and creamed spinach.  So, if you're looking for a steakhouse in Vegas, Stripsteak will impress.  Don't be scared to dine on the Strip!"

I am sure glad we did.\n\nI ordered/tried only appetizers this time around.  The list includes Skirt Steak, Oysters, Tiger Prawns, Crab Cakes, Duck Fat Fries, Lobster Fitters and Kobe Sliders.  I could write on and on about how good everything was, but I'll keep this short.\n\nThe Skirt Steak was remarkable.  I'd say it was about an 8oz serving and had a chimichurri sauce over it.  Perfectly grilled to my liking.  It was almost as tender as filet.  The steak had a nice char on the outside.  Just perfection all around.\n\nMy next favorite the Kobe Sliders.  I'll admit I've never had the pleasure of having a full Kobe steak at any restaurant.  I sort of think it is overhyped, but these were sublime.  They were small, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was a perfect size.  If you go to their Happy Hour, they are 50% off ($10 instead of $20), order 2 orders, they are that good.\n\nThe Duck Fat Fries were great.  There were 3 different kinds.  Most reviews have written about them, but I am reiterating how good they were.  The middle ones with the truffle aioli was the best of the bunch.\n\nMy next trip to Vegas, hopefully sooner than later, I will be stopping here to try a full meal.  The bartenders commented repeatedly how good their Rib Cap Steak is.  Gotta try it."

Not great (4star) not amazing (5 star) just good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly how you ask and they have a pretty decent rub on them.  They are aged and tender as one would expect from any big name steak house.  They gave us a complimentary selection of pommes frittes which were delectable and the truffled mac and cheese was tasty.  However, not a single one of these items mentioned above was better than a 3.5 star rating.  \n\nYou could argue that my palate cannot discern the difference between the beefs, but I would like to at least think I can tell the difference between a grain fed cow and one that is massaged by the japanese from kobe.  It also could just be that I've had so many steakhouse steaks that an aged piece of prime beef with a generic rub of salt/pepper just is old hat to me.  \n\nService: The service is very good.  As expected from any high end vegas restaurant, they were very attentive and always served you with a smile.  I was amused with the sommelier we saw opening a bottle of wine.  You see, our table was right next to the small station where they open all the bottles of wine.  One table ordered one with a synthetic wine cork.  I know from experience those things are a B*^%@ to open.  It was comforting to know that a man who drinks and dispenses wine for a living also has problems with said cork.\n\nAmbiance: Dimly lit, contemporary decor, open kitchen with the meat locker right next to it.  The restaurant is a great place for a date.  \n\nPrice: This is where I felt they fall WAY short.  We walked out of there for about 70 to 80 per person.  This included a steak and a side.  The lady got a sirloin steak and i got the ribeye.  If you've been out, you know that the sirloin is the cheaper of the few cuts.  That's why I was surprised that the total bill was pushing over 150.  \n\nDont' get me wrong, the strip steak was great.  The ribeye was good.  But in all honesty, I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Flemmings where they have something unique.  The broiled steak with butter.  Quality of the meat MIGHT not be as good but it doesn't fall too far away from that at Stripsteak.\n\nAfter going to Michael Mina's in Bellagio and coming here. I was excited at first but disappointed after leaving."

There is a trio of different fries, all seasoned differently.  The fries are accompanied with three different dipping sauces.  I would take this over a bread basket any day.\n\nI ordered the Diver Scallops, while my guests had the Wagyu Rib Cap and the Chicken Friend Veal.  My scallops were nothing to write about.  I've had better and the portion was small to my liking.  The other entrees on the other hand were delicious and filling.

After another 5 minutes I check to see if our table was ready. Said it would be soon, just a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I asked about our table and again the answer was soon. Not a good thing to keep a large group and important clients waiting 15 minutes for a private room that was supposed to be reserved. \n\nFinally we were told our tables were ready but it was just that, normal tables in their regular dining area. We informed them that their must be a mistake since we specifically reserved their private dining room. We were given some attitude and told that we were mistaken but they would look into it. They quickly learned from their group reservation department that their was some sort of lack or mix-up of communication between them and the hostess. The general manager shows up and began to sweat and apologize to us a thousand times. \n\nNothing could be done at the time because they had already given away tables in their private dining area. There was only an approximate estimate of an hour wait to move to that area. We decided to start at the tables we had and move if the private area became available soon. \n\nFortunately they said they would be able to move us to the private area after 20 minutes so we headed over. Unfortunately it was not a private room but just a semi-private area partially enclosed by glass walls. And there were still some other diners in the area but we were assured the tables would remain empty once they finished. \n\nAfter all of this drama I thought to myself \"hopefully the food is AMAZING and redeems this entire mess.\" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. The blue crab chowder was too salty, the prime rib was mediocre at best (I'd rather have Bellagio buffet prime rib), and the desserts were forgetful. \n\nIn addition, the service was pretty poor. A number of us had finished our drinks and had empty glasses on our table. They remained empty on our table for at least 20-30 minutes. When I had my water refilled I asked them to take away my other empty glass. It was taken away but all of the other empty glasses were ignored. It was bizarre to me that this simple task was overlooked, especially after the general manager said that he would make sure that we were taken care of and serviced well. He also mentioned that he would give us additional drinks and food and not charge us. After we received the final bill that didn't seem to be the case and it looked like we were charged the full amount. \n\nWhat added insult to this all was that the other tables in our semi-private dining area didn't remain empty, they continued to fill them with new diners. We spent about $5000 for the worst possible dining experience on clients who do over $50 million in business with us."

            "review": "The following review is based on one dinner experience:\n\nFOOD: 5 stars\n\nAppetizer - Trio of Duck Fat Fries\nEach meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  The trio includes:\n\n1.  Paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard cr\u00e8me dip\n2. Truffle fries accompanied with truffle a\u00efoli dip\n3. Rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip\n\nMy taste buds couldn't really tell the difference between duck fat fries and fries cooked in regular vegetable oil.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The fries aren't particularly better than any other restaurant quality fries, but they make for a nice \"complimentary\" appetizer while waiting for your meal.  \n\nThere's more than enough pics of the fries on Yelp so you can get a glimpse of the appearance and presentation.  \n\n\nEntrees:\n\nThe steak entrees have a very simple presentation with just the meat, a grilled scallion, and grilled yellow pepper on a large plate.  Both steaks smelled like they were hot off the grill.  \n\n1. 16oz Dry-Aged Bone In Rib Eye (medium well)  $51\n\nThis particular steak is more fatty than the Filet Mignon and Kansas City Strip.  The fattiness contributes to the melts in your mouth factor.  Not a piece of this meat had that dry chewy quality that separates good steaks from bad steaks.  I'm not sure how the meat was seasoned, but there was a subtle spiciness that enhanced the flavor of the meat.  \n\n2. 10oz Filet Mignon (medium well)  $54\n\nThis steak was my favorite.  Once again the meat was tender and flavorful.  Although it wasn't fatty like the rib eye, it was still amazingly moist and melted in my mouth.  \n\n\nSERVICE: 5 stars\n\nOur server was very quick, attentive, and friendly.  She was all about enhancing \"the experience\".   She was also accommodating to all our special requests and knowledgeable.  What I thought was cool about this place was that when I asked for another side of the mustard for the fries, they didn't just bring me a small cup, but decent sized bowl.  \n\nI thought it was kind of annoying though that as we left, every person who worked there said goodnight to us.  I understand the concept of service, but having all your employees say good night to customers who they had no interaction with comes off as a bit fake.  \n\nI noticed some reviewers complaining that service was slow.  They must have gone during a busy weekend because we were quickly seated and had no issues with slow service.  \n\n\nMisc. Info:\n\nStripsteak is good for a date, dinner with friends, or a celebration dinner.  It's not super formal, but I wouldn't come here wearing shorts and a wife beater.  \n\nIf you come with a date, you're likely to be seated near the bar where they have more seating for 2.  Most of the restaurant seems organized based on seating groups.  \n\nGet the deal on www.restaurant.com"

We had to ask for refills on our water, alcohol, etc.\n\nThe duck fat fries were amazing, as were their accompanying sauces.  Michael Mina, and his obsession with threes, did well with the three types of fries and sauces.\n\nThe steak wasn't amazing.  It pains me to type that.  I expected to bite into that steak and be like \"mmmmmmmmm\" but it was more like \"mmm.\"\n\nThe sides I tried were excellent - the truffle mac and cheese was outstanding and the flavors and textures of the creamed spinach made my mouth happy.\n\nThe bathrooms were filthy.\n\nWith so many amazing steak places in Vegas, I expected more here.

The truffle fries with aoli was my favorite. I ordered a crab claw for an appetizer. It was good. It was big and I believe $$$. So if you have read my reviews, you will know Im always on a quest for the prefect NY Strip. And the strip here does not disappoint. In fact, it may be one of the best strip steaks Ive ever had. The flavors were robust. The meat was perfectly cooked, nice and juicy and the marbling was charred, which was perfect. The steak was about as perfect as one can get. I also added a lobster tail with my steak, and that was good too. The whole meal was completely satisfying. \n\nI was pleased with the whole experience. The ambiance, the service and food was top notch. I didnt think it was that expensive for the quality of food."

Their cocktails were also incredible-I had an old fashioned and it was great. \n\nCan't say enough good things about this place. They pay attention to every little detail. The last time I was here I was with a group of people and we were going to catch a show (Phantom of the Opera) following dinner.

            "review": "One quote says it all \"The Waygu Rib Cap was the best steak I have ever had!\". This was from my Dad after we finnished dinner last Tuesday night. \n\nEverything was perfection. We started with the complimentary duck fat fries. Each type had it's own mouthwatering flavors, but my Dad's favorite was the truffle, while mine was the Old Bay Seasoning with the herb sauce. YUM. \n\nWe also ordered the fresh oysters. We were given the choice of east or west coast, and we chose the smaller, sweeter Kusshi oysters from the west. They were perfect. The minuet sauce was fresh and paired with they perfectly. We then split a caesar salad. I loved their dressing and how it came with a anchovie on the side. \n\nOnto the STEAK. Which is why you really need to come here in the first place. Like I said, he ordered the Waygu Rib Cap, which if you read the other reviews is amazing. It's rich and full of flavor. It's Waygu, so expect it to be a little fatty (but a GOOD, full of FLAVOR fatty). I ordered the Filet, which was cooked just the way I like it. Both were medium rare. The rib cap had a nice charred crust on it which is another sign that it was cooked properly. \n\nTHE SIDES - oh the sides! We ordered the trio of potato puree. Horseradish, Lobster, and Sour Cream & Onion. My favorite was the horseradish becasue it think it pairs well with the meat. His favorite was the lobster with nice big chunks of loster in it. Basically to die for. We also had the creamed spinach which was another favorite. \n\nHonestly I can't say a bad thing about this meal. We finnsihed off a bottle of wine between the two of us. Yes it's expensive, but a nice steakhouse in Vegas SHOULD be expensive! It's all about the service, amazing food, and atmosphere. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to reccommend this place to ALL of my friends looking for a nice night out!"

I had the chicken ($39), which left me unimpressed, as it was rather bland, and my husband had the wagyu filet ($83) that while he very much enjoyed, couldn't say it was the best he'd ever had (though by far the most expensive). The potatoes au gratin are a must, probably the best thing they have besides that tiny square of instant bacon they serve. For dessert we went with the beignets ($24), again, nothing to write home about. The three dipping sauces were very thick, I wouldn't describe them as dipping sauces but rather desserts in their own right (creme brulee).

These delicious fries came prepared (i.e. seasoned) three different ways with three different sauces. I'm drooling just thinking about those sweet, sweet fries... ((Mmmmghghgh))\n\nMy friend and I shared a Porterhouse with some King Crab... It was nearly a religious experience. The steak was so tender, I could've sworn it simply fell apart in my mouth. I've never had such an amazing steak. Don't get me wrong, it hasn't ruined me for other places, like Ruth's Chris or Boa, but it certainly set a very high standard. It needed absolutely no further seasoning and was cooked perfectly. The King Crab, well, it was good, but then again King Crab is fairly consistent from place to place. \n\nPricey? Yeah, but well worth the throwdown. I'm glad my friend dragged me here, because she really made an excellent pick - as I ate, there was nowhere else on Earth I'd have rather been."

It was good, but I wasn't feeling the big chunks of broccoli in it.\n-Masami Farms American Kobe \"Eye\" of rib eye and fillet Mignon- were tender and cooked to perfection. steaks were garnished with a large roasted and steamed orange peppers added a sweet and slightly crunchiness to the steaks when eaten together.\n- Spiced Carrot Cake- don't expect a neatly sliced triangle or square cake topped with cream cheese. This dessert is very \"new age-ie\" where the cream cheese is smeared on the dish, the cake is crumbled like a decimated city and it's dolloped with a scoop of carrot sorbet and vanilla ice cream.

With its classic menu, inviting bar scene and sophisticated atmosphere, STRIPSTEAK plays host to guests looking for the perfect filet in a modern alternative to the traditional steakhouse setting. As with Mina's other restaurants, STRIPSTEAK uses only the highest quality ingredients - corn-fed, all-natural meat; line-caught seafood and fresh, seasonal produce. While first-rate components are essential, it is Mina's creative approach to cooking that has made his name.\n\nSTRIPSTEAK features a menu rife with imaginative interpretations of classic steakhouse favorites using state-of-the-art kitchen equipment. STRIPSTEAK offers three kinds of beef, Certified Angus Beef, American Kobe and 'A5' Japanese Kobe, and is home to two wood-burning grills and six circulating, slow-poaching chambers. The signature slow-poaching method enhances flavor and tenderness by heating the meat for several hours at a low temperature, while the mesquite-stoked grills infuse every cut with a subtle smokiness.\n***\n\nWith that said, this place is devilishly good.  The modern decor coupled with a menu that will send your taste buds dancing earns this place the coveted 5th star.  While enjoying my meal, my friends, and the talent on display in walks....da da dum Andre Agassi.  Wow!\n\nHe was very lively, his presence filled the room.  He was engaging with the many guests requesting pics.  I was too befuddled to reach for my camera.  Don't ask me why something about being so close to a multiple Grand Slam Champion.  Turns out he is a part owner in this latest iteration of Michael Minna's restaurants.  Go, enjoy and keep your eyes peeled you never know who you might catch a glimpse of."

I'm not a fan of pork or jicama but the Instant Bacon was to die for. For our main courses, I had the wild pacific halibut and my husband had the 8oz Rib Cap Wagyu with the potato trio. I loved the cream sauce on my halibut as well as the asparagus and peas that came with it. The staff was great, friendly, and very knowledgable. Thanks Stripsteak for helping make my husband's birthday so awesome!"

The service was good-nothing stellar but not bad-average I guess, and the restaurant is pretty. But I'm only giving it 3 stars, and here's why...\n\nThe food was good. Or at least the presentation and menu options. To start with, i got the lobster fritters (yum, and eat them wrapped in the lettuce) and hubbs got the tomato soup with lobster grilled cheese. For main course i ordered the portherhouse, and hubbs got the Kansas strip. They were really good, but dayum!! Did we also get served salt licks with each course??? At first one of the waitresses kept filling up our waters every two or three sips, literally-and then we figured out why. Every single dish-EVERY SINGLE DISH-was insanely salty!!! Not just the apps, but the duck fat fries, the foccacia, the truffeled mac and cheese, even the steaks!! Don't get me wrong-the food was good. But dear lord-I think I sent my blood pressure through the roof with all the salt. It was crazy. Literally, every dish!!! Except my mint chocolate chip ice cream that i had for dessert.\n\nI don't think it was amazing enough that we'd go back. Like I said, the food was good-but just too freaking salty for us to totally enjoy and savor it."

            "review": "My Mother-In-Law & I chose StripSteak for dinner one evening during our stay at Mandalay Bay. First of all, every restaurant in a hotel in Las Vegas is over priced, as expected. We decided we would have our splurge night here. Anyways...\n\nWe were able to be seated without a reservation, about 6:30. We ordered two glasses of Pinot Noir at $15 a piece. Our server told us we would be receiving a complimentary appetizer that evening. The appetizer were duck fat cooked french fries, done three ways. The fries were amazing, each seperately dished, seasoned and they each came with their own dipping sauce. Really tasty. Due to the pricing, my mother in law and I decided to share one of the larger steaks and order two seperate sides. I believe we ordered the 16 oz Kansas City Strip. $50+ for the one steak, a la carte. The steak was cooked to order, medium rare.\n\nNow, on to why I am rating three stars. I LOVE steak, cooked many different ways. The steak had a nice charred crust, which I love. But, it tasted like charred, burnt butter, which delivered a very unpleasant, bitter, chary taste which I was not expecting with a steak of this caliber. It was seriously unpleasant and I having to try hard to eat it all. \n\nOtherwise, we ordered the brussel sprouts which were AMAZING in their bacony, vinegary goodness. We also ordered baked Artichoke with goat cheese, which were also amazing, but personally, I would have ordered double brussel sprouts. \n\nOnto desert, I cannot personally recall the name of the dish, but I know it came with cocoa nib ice cream which was heavenly. \n\nOur service was excellent, and we had a very pleasureable dining experience. It can get a little loud, but the ambiance is excellent. \n\nSo 3 stars due to the over excessive pricing and the charred taste of the steaks. Otherwise, it was great!"

Nice piece of meat; cooked perfectly; literally melts in your mouth. Creamed spinach was good, too; not too creamy or cheesy; nice spinach flavor. The mac and cheese was also good, made with gouda cheese; good flavor without being overpowering. The dessert was great; beignets with butterscotch pudding and caramel; it was different; the beignets themselves were light, and as good as anyone's. The size of the sides are good for two couples, as long as you have two or three to share. \nThe bad. The place was packed, and very noisy. Although the pricing is such it would justify a very elegant dining room, the place is very plain. Clearly, the money has been spent on the food and not the d\u00e9cor.  But the food definitely warrants the praise."

Standards like Ribeye are aged and cooked to perfection with right amount of char. The sides are a real stand out with Brussels sprouts as a star.

On my first visit I had a full three-course meal that ranks as one of my best dining experiences ever. \n\nMy most recent meal was simpler (entree, side dish and coffee) but was still outstanding. I ordered the 12 oz. skirt steak with a side of scalloped potatoes with bleu cheese. Both portions were beautifully prepared and absolutely delicious. The scalloped potatoes in particular are unbelievably rich but also completely heavenly. Special mention should also go to the free sampler of french fries (herb, truffle, and peanut) and dipping sauces that I received while waiting for my main course. My server was very friendly and professional as were the host staff. \n\nAll in all, this is an excellent high-end steakhouse that more than justifies it's hefty price-level. Recommended!"

Tables with no cloths and paper place mats.  That seems to be the thing with a lot of Vegas steak houses now, charge premium prices but present a coffee shop atmosphere.  \n\nNone of that is as important as the food, of course.  We both love steak tartare, so we ordered that for the appetizer.  It was loaded with black pepper. So much so, that frankly, that's all I could taste.  \n\nThen a 50 minute wait for our main course.  At about 40 minutes I was getting irate and was just about to go complain when the general manager did stop by our table to apologize and say our food would be here shortly.  \n\nWhen the main course did finally arrive, the wagyu filets we both ordered were both cooked perfectly, and were melt-in-your-mouth delicous.  I ordered a lobster tail with mine, and it was small and chewy.  The sides  we ordered were average, not bad, but nothing great.\n\nThe service was friendly, but very poor. Our server seemed a bit...how should I say this...out of it.  Whenever she came to our table she had a huge smile on her face, as if she just a heard a hilarious joke.  But if I asked her a question about something, she didn't even respond, as if she didn't hear me.  I know it was loud in there, but you would think she could see me looking at her with my lips moving.  Because of the 50 minute wait (during which we never saw her, by the way), we had finished our bottle of wine before the steaks even arrived, so I ordered another glass with our main course.   She finally brought it with desert. Along with our coffee. SIgh.  Speaking of desert, it was fine, once again nothing special, but pretty good.\n\n$460.00 with tip for the two of us. That included a $120 bottle of wine.  It was just not worth it. Craftsteak is much better, and Delmonico is much much better.  \n\nI'm baffled at all the rave reviews.  Maybe we just hit it on a bad night?  Or maybe a lot of people have just never been to a really good steak house?  I mean, yeah we did get the free french fries too, and they were tasty, but really, they're just french fries people"

You will wait and wait, you will beg and ask the dishwasher to please dear God bring you your beer, but you will NOT leave disappointed in the food. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went last night (Saturday evening) and the wait was non-existent. We were seated in a beautifully designed dining room at a large table. We waited and waited and waited on our first beer, but we were okay with that because we'd been at the bar drinking before dinner anyway. The waitress was polite enough and seemingly efficient, but then would wander away waiting on the tables around us while we fantasized about another drink. Eventually we got one more.  \n\nI don't want to harp on the waitstaff, but when you present a beautiful place with an outstanding menu (and wow, the prices) then you expect to be waited on accordingly. No, not here. Anyway, onto the real star, the meal!\n\nOrdered some East Coast oysters. The waiter said the oysters from the West Coast were smaller and we like our oysters to have something to bite into, so...Got the oysters and they were TINY. I don't want to know what the West Coast were like. Regardless, these were the best oysters I do believe I've ever had the pleasure of eating. There weren't enough, and in my estimation, with the way those tasted, never will be enough. I could have eaten them for days. As Rowan Jacobsen says 'at some level, it's not about taste or smell at all. Because an oyster, like a lover, first captures you by bewitching your mind.' These are those oysters. Get them.\n\nWe then ordered the 18 oz. dry aged bone-in rib eye. Wow, wow, wow. WOW. It came out cooked a little more rare than we asked (medium rare), and while usually that much red in meat makes me shy away, it was hardly relevant with this steak. It melted in my mouth. Every taste was better than the one before. I have never, ever eaten a steak that tasted this way. I was considering going full vegetarian, but after this steak there will never be a chance of that. I have eaten at Cut, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT, and many, many more. None have ever come close to the steak I had at STRIPSTEAK. None. As a bonus, my BF ordered foie gras to go on top. Listen, if you asked me to trade sex for a year for all the foie gras I could eat from this restaurant, well, let's just say I'd miss my BF a lot. It was THE best thing that has ever touched my lips and I mean that with everything I have. If you don't get this you are missing out on the most divine dining experiences you could possibly have. I have to stop talking about it. Moving on...\n\nI can't skip the sides we had with our fabulous meal. The potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish) was, as stated, a puree, and I tend to like my mashed potatoes with a little more body, but these were out of this world. The flavors were subtle and smooth, and really, now I'll never want to eat garlic mashed again. THANKS A LOT, STRIPSTEAK. We also had the truffled mac and cheese. Speechless. It was the most divine taste of truffles in any dish I've ever tried with them. The musky, earthy flavor was just enough. I ate the whole thing (sorry, honey). \n\nOkay, the letdown here was the dessert, but you really don't go for the dessert anyway, right? While I don't remember what they called it, we had miniature donuts with a couple of dipping sauces. While I've had this dessert elsewhere and loved it, here it fell flat and really shouldn't be on a menu as amazing as this. Avoid. \n\nMy suggestion is, if you want to round out your experiences with great steak RUN, don't walk, here. This place sets the bar for it."

So the hustle and bustle of the casino is very present during your dining experience. That being said the venue is quite large and is well decorated. It has like a modern meat nightclub feel. There was a \"20min\" wait when we put our name in, but then the 20 minutes were up they said it would be another 20 minute wait. But there was self seating in the \"exposed area\" near the bar. So if you go here keep an eye out for open seat there to avoid a wait. The food here was very good. I had a ribeye and that was cooked perfectly, the flavors were spot on. We tried mushroom and french fries for sides both were excellent! The fries came with a variety of sauces that were a nice change from the regular ketchup most people serve.

First off, the prices are like 25-50 percent more than your average steakhouse. So, the total bill was $300, including tip, and that was without wine. A small piece of steak was about $90, and we weren't impressed. First off, when you are spending $300 for two on a dinner, it should be something special. At least that has been our experience, and we've had amazing food and beautiful ambiance for substantially less. Here's what we were turned off by:\n\n1. From what we could see, there was one server tending to about 15 tables on a Saturday night. I looked over and saw her running around to all these tables and it felt oddly IHOP-esque. She came to our table way less frequently than she should have at a restaurant of this quality.\n\n2. It took 45 MINUTES for our steak to come out. I mean, my wife and I were talking and enjoying the conversation, but it came a point where we looked at each other and called the server over.\n\n3. $89 for a small piece of steak, which came with a thumb sized piece of cornbread and about a half ounce of honey. No pretty garnish or anything on the plate.\n\n4. I thought maybe we were being critical, but my wife went to the bathroom (only one stall, apparently, so she had to wait outside), and she struck up conversation with a couple other people who had nearly identical criticisms.\n\nI would strongly suggest trying any other steakhouse in Vegas.

The Japanese ones are worth a try (you can cut the meat with your fork) because its better then what other steak houses offers.

We had a party of 5 & took our foodie friends. There may have been tears of joy shed & it was THE PERFECT last meal of our trip.\n\nFor apps, we did crispy duck rolls, pork belly (instant bacon on the menu) & crab legs. The duck was great, but the latter two were so phenomenal it made a great app underwhelming. As always, the complimentary duck fat fries were a big hit.\n\nThree of us had scallops for our entrees; they were perfection. One had the flat iron steak; again, perfect w/no complaints. But the absolute stars of the culinary show were the rib cap & the bone marrow side. Oh. My. God. Rich, delicious, heaven! \n\nOther sides we ordered were pork belly fried rice, brussels sprouts & gratin potatoes. All had subtle, perfectly harmonized flavors. Perhaps one thing I personally did not care for was the preparation on the brussel spouts; they were rather soft (but GREAT flavor) & I prefer mine roasted & a little charred & crispy. \n\nWe shared beignets for dessert (7 pieces w/creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate & well-aged-scotch butterscotch sauces) they were perfect as we were all stuffed but couldn't pass up a sweet bite ending. We also had after dinner drinks & the big hit was one made w/vodka, kalh\u00faa & frosted flake (yes, the cereal) soaked milk. It was GRRRREAT! We'll definitely be back!"

Seating is first come first serve at the bar and lounge area in the front section of the restaurant.  Although the food offerings/specials for happy hour are few in number, all doubts will be cast away as soon as you get a whiff and taste of the food.\n\nThe bar and lounge food menu consists of a mere 5 items, and my friend and I decided on 3:\n\n1)  Prime Rib Sliders, $10; au jus with brioche bun\n2)  Meatballs, $8; with heirloom tomato sauce and aged jack cheese\n3)  Duck Spring Roll, $9; hot and sour cherry sauce\n\nWe ordered 1 item that was not listed on the menu, and that was the the trio of duck fat fries with herb, truffle, and bbq dipping sauces..\n\nAs far as drinks, select beers are $3, well drinks $6, and an assortment of \"featured cocktails\" are $6 as well.\n\nAside from the duck fat fries, our other favorite dish of the evening were the meatballs, as we thought the combination of the sauce and aged jack cheese certainly made a flavorful combination.  The prime rib sliders can be slightly on the messy side so make sure to have ample napkins available.  The spring rolls were delicious, but not as wonderful as the duck fat fries.  Truth be told, my friend and I ordered and devoured 2 orders of duck fat fries that night.....that dish is a winner!\n\nSERVICE:  Excellent and outstanding.  The 2 female servers were very polite, patient, and always checked on us in a timely manner.\n\nBottom Line:  One of the happiest hours I've been to =)  I'll definitely be back on future trips to Vegas."

I bought a restaurant.com certificate before our trip and this was the first one we used. \n\nWe made reservations for 6pm and were promptly seated. It took a little while for our server to actually come over to the table and ask what we would want for drinks. I read reviews beforehand that warned about slow service. After we took some time to look over the menu and decided what we wanted we were given Duck Fat Fries with three sauces. These are amazing and I do hope that people get a chance to try them.\n\nFor my appetizer I ordered the Maine Lobster Fritters, which were to die for. For dinner I had the Braised Pork Shank, others in my park had the 12 oz. Skirt Steak, American Kobe Burger, and Golden Trout. We also ordered some sides such as the potato, asparagus, and spinach souffle. All the main entrees and sides were to die for. I think my mother-in-law was the only one who did not absolutely love their food. She got the Golden Trout and just thought it was ok.  The food was cooked perfectly. My Braised Pork Shank just fell off the bone and my husband was in love with the American Kobe Burger.\n\nIf you are looking for a cheap place to eat this is not it but it is worth every dime. For six people our bill was around $200 after the restaurant.come gift certificate."

I ended up ordering Japanese Wagyu Beef Satay as my meal.  My husband ordered a steak.  We also ordered  a baked potato to accompany our meal.  After close to 45 minutes we wondering where our meals were as it seemed everyone around us were getting theirs.  Finally after close to a hour, our food comes out.  I took my first bite and my Beef Satay was ice cold.  My husband's steak was cold but the baked potato was hot?  Odd?  We flagged down another waiter as ours just wasn't attentive.  The waiter immediately took our meals back and we waited not even 10 minutes when our order came back out.  My Satay was piping hot and delicious.  The black pepper soy glaze was just perfect.  My husband's steak came out but the baked potato didn't come out.  While we're almost done with our meal our baked potato comes out.  Seriously???  We ended up returning the baked potato.  We ended our meal with the beignets which were really good.  We would have enjoyed our experience here if our service was better."

So I purchased a $50 Restaurant.com gift certificate for like $4.  Upon arrival I was awed by it's sleek sexy modern look.  \n\nI ordered the 12 oz. Skirt Steak ($36) & he got the 16 oz. Kansas City Rib Eye ($48).  We shared a side of the Asparagus with the Horseradish Buerre Blanc sauce on the side ($13).  Shortly after Mina's well known duck-fat fries came out, three different types of fries & dipping sauces but of course my favorite were the truffle fries with the truffle dipping sauce.  All the steaks are mesquite grilled & served a la carte.  The seasoning on our steaks differed slightly.  His had more pepper than mine.  Overall the meat was okay, not bad not terrific just okay especially for the price tag!  The asparagus however was grilled nicely & I liked the subtlety of the sauce.\n\nOur waiter was helpful and knowledgeable though I felt like we got more attention/service from the busboy & busgirl.  I probably should have not got the Restaurant.com gift certificate & shelled out more money for another steak restaurant closer to our room at Wynn, but on an optimistic note, at least I can say I finally tried a Michael Mina restaurant!"

We had several friends visiting this weekend and decided to have a group dinner here.\n\nThere were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.\n\nOriginally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.\n\nWe were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.\n\nThe server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.\n\nWhen the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.\n\nFor a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.\n\nNobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.\n\nWill I return?  You bet your Steaks I will!!"

I had to call the waiter over twice, he talked me out of it once, then after a second bite, I had to convince the waiter to take it back. Then I was brought a second steak - cooked properly, but fatty.  *Sigh* I accepted it. I would've rather had that first one, not overdone.  \n\nDespite the method of \"butter poaching\" the steak to make it \"juicy,\" my filet was on the dry side.\n\nWe had a choice of bibb lettuce salad or crab chowder (go for the salad), sides were a sampling of truffle mac-n-cheese, creamed spinach with bacon (came out cold), and sauteed brussel sprouts (the best), and beniets with chocolate, butterscotch (yum), or creme brulee (okay).\n\nFor the price, I guess it's not bad for Vegas, but it isn't a steakhouse I'd visit again."

            "review": "***StripSteak is a typical Michael Mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in Las Vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***\n\nThere is definitely a comforting consistency with Michael Mina restaurants regardless of the location. You are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a Michael Mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. Michael Mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so I am rarely surprised by his food.\u00a0\n\nMichael Mina in San Francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with San Francisco's best high-end cuisine. I remember finding Michael Mina in Las Vegas being good but nothing memorable. Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe I need to give them another shot.\u00a0\n\nStripSteak in Mandalay Bay is a Michael Mina steakhouse. It has all the trademarks of a Michael Mina restaurant with Asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order.\u00a0Like Michael Mina's Arcadia in San Jose, StripSteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. Fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. The fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive.\u00a0\n\nI tried two of their beef cuts. The best was the Wagyu rib cap. This beef was very rich, juicy and tender. It did not match the best rib cap I've had, which was at Splendido in Toronto. That Canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. Still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender.\u00a0\n\nThe other steak was disappointing. It was a Prime bone-in ribeye. The steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. While it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick ribeyes you can get at a high-end steakhouse like Mastro's.\u00a0The steak was garnished with complimentary bone marrow. I also added grilled foie gras, which was fine but too pricey.\n\nFor sides, I had the pork belly fried rice that was mixed with carrots and peas. The fried rice was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of fried rice dishes I've had. I enjoyed the heat though I am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. I also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. The asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. The butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus.\u00a0\n\nFor dessert, I had the beignets with three sauces. The beignets were fairly good. They were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets I've had at restaurants like Village Pub and Spruce in the Bay Area as well as what I used to enjoy at the now closed Hatfield's in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n\nThe sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. There was a very good creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. There was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. The last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. The pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable.\u00a0\n\nService was good--friendly and polite. It is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants I've tried.\u00a0\n\nPrices are high, but it is Las Vegas. I think StripSteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.\u00a0\n\nAs mentioned, StripSteak is a loud restaurant. It is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. I did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of Las Vegas. I did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner.\u00a0\n\nStripSteak is a perfectly fine Las Vegas steakhouse. I think StripSteak really separates itself from other steakhouses I've been to across the country with its sides. The sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare. \u00a0The rib cap was very good while the ribeye was disappointing. If you are a big steak fan, I would recommend Carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but StripSteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in Las Vegas.\n\nLike most casinos on The Strip, parking at Mandalay Bay is free."

I give the edge to StripSteak on the amuse bouche duck fat fries.  They were so good that we were salivating over the un-touched portion that the table next to us didn't finish.  And, although the bread was good, there something more unique about the popovers at BLT.\n\nAs for entrees, three of us chose the ribeye ($51 each), which had a good flavor due to the fat content, but made me rethink choosing it over the filet ($54), luckily I got a nice sample of the filet since it's owner couldn't finish it.  Edge to BLT.\n\nSides.  Edge to StripSteak.  We ordered three to share among the four of use.  Mac N Cheese ($12), Cream Corn ($13), and the Spinach Souffle ($12).  While we felt each was good, the Cream Corn was our least favorite with the Spinach Souffle being my most favorite.  And, we probably could have been fine with two sides since the portion of the sides were much larger in comparison to BLT. \n\nThree of us had drinks.  The service was attentive.  And, like BLT, since we declined dessert, we were provided with a complimentary treat, which was two small bags of chocolate caramel corn, which was good, but not was good as the pecan treats BLT has.  \n\nI know it's not necessarily fair to compare StripSteak with BLT, but  again I thought about the comparison during dinner.  \n\nI think StripSteak could have done a better job of designing the interior to give you the feel that you weren't inside a Casino, but rather a Michael Mina level restaurant. \n\nTotal, excluding tip, for the four of us was $304.84."

Our group, each having two cocktails each, sides and steak had about a $600 meal total for 4 people.

Nothing too out of the ordinary and I didn't really find the setting too intimate. \n\nServer was quirky and somewhat attentive.

My husband had the scotch flight and said it was very good. Started off with the crab spring rolls, probably would skip the $25 appetizer next time since we had a lot more food coming. We felt like we wasted it only having 2 people. Husband got the American vs Australian Wagyu entree, basically it was two different types of amazingly tender delicious beef. He thoroughly enjoyed it. I got the filet mignon, my usual, it was very good but tasted like many I've had before. We shared the trio of potato pur\u00e9e, lobster, sour cream and onion and horseradish. Horseradish and sour cream and onion were delicious but I generally don't like lobster that much. All three were very good. Didn't do dessert but they all sounded delicious.

I have yet to try Minetta Tavern or Carnevino (only drinks), but until I hit those establishments, StripSteak is top of the heap.  \nMy wife and I each ordered a filet; her's was outstanding, but my Kobe filet was the greatest thing I have ever eaten.  The taste and texture was one of a kind.  We also devoured the creamed spinach and truffle mac and cheese.  And of course, as everyone else has said the fries (gratis) are unbelievable.  We had to wait about 40 minutes, but it was a saturday and we did not have reservations.  thankfully, mandaly bay provides entertainment in the form of craps tables...in addition to its amazing steakhouse."

            "review": "A much improved second visit under Chef Tony Schutz -\n\nWithout a doubt the site of one of the worst Las Vegas meals in memory it took a change at the helm to provoke renewed interest in Stripsteak, Chef Tony Schutz having recently taken over the shoebox of a kitchen that serves over 300 patrons each evening, and has been doing so for ten years running.\n\nSetting aside previous events, yet ironically seeing this reservation also compromised at the start as someone had somehow entered it for Saturday, it was with the immediate intervention of a young woman named Ashley that the appropriate information was ascertained - a tight four-top along the wall nearest the kitchen situated for three over the course of nearly four hours.\n\nHaving arranged the reservation by way of another member of Michael Mina's collection of talent, a request for prix-fixe carte blanche happily accepted by Chef Schutz whose work at PUB1842 was significantly undervalued by locals, it was after brief greetings from the Kitchen staff and servers that cocktails were mixed for out-of-town guests while a brisk glass of Brut was poured for me, the signature Duck Fat Fries soon landing and still industry standard even compared to the best of the best seen in Brussels this past May.\n\nMaking a few small requests early on, personal favorites and those of friends easily worked in, course one saw Chef Tony start light with snappy Yellowtail Sashimi layered amidst sliced Cucumbers and Serrano Chilies, the \"Crispy Rice Poppers\" alternating Hamachi and Ahi Tuna Tartare atop something not unlike an Arancini with a crown of Roe and bright Citrus dressing.\n\nDrinking the Champagne faster than usual, but finding Iced Tea and Red Wine better suited for the heavier courses to follow, three full Bones arrived next with their hemisected insides topped in smoky green Herbs alongside toasted Bread for spreading, the  Braised Shortrib Ravioli not quite as refined as those at Carnevino, but still well designed as the rich pillows rested in a puddle of earthy Jus with Ricotta Salata and crispy Parsnips.\n\nFinding pumping techno as off-putting as prior, the high-ceilinged space already loud by way of a full-house, it was after a prolonged trip to the single-person restroom that my friend came back as Chefs visibly waited patiently at the kitchen door for nearly five minutes, the signature 'Instant Bacon' not losing any of its effect as smoke and sweetness quickly flooded the palate while a ubiquitous Beet Salad once again evidenced that few 'celebrity chefs' have the same passion for produce that Michael Mina does.\n\nTrying to show the kitchen's diversity with entrees and additions, three grilled items and a similar number of side dishes delivered with share plates already holding Cornbread and Honey, it was during a later kitchen tour that we learned each steak is subjected to an immersion circulator bath of clarified butter before Grilling, the Rib Eye perfect medium rare with a good crust while both the Fish and Duck were cooked beautifully, the latter a new preparation for the fall season while both the Sprouts and Cauliflower are also set to be launched soon.\n\nUnable to resist consuming every bite of the Potatoes, the multi-layered stack as rich and sizable as it was tempting, it was with only a hint of regret that we returned from the kitchen tour to find the table decked out in desserts, Pastry Chef Monica Delgadillo serving Mina's Signature Root Beer float alongside Stripsteak's famous Beignets plus a plate of eight small bites and the wholly hedonistic skillet of S'mores.\n\nFOUR STARS:  Still a bit too 'trendy' to feel like a serious restaurant where dinner for four can push $500 or more there is little to be faulted in terms of the Stripsteak kitchen under Chef Schutz, a return visit once he has had the opportunity to truly create a menu likely to make me enjoy the place even more."

The duck fat fries were good and the duck fat did impart a good flavor to the fries that was interesting. I also had the soy glazed shitake mushrooms. They were a bit too sweet for my liking and i thought that there should have been a bit less sugar and more acid with them. The decor is very open and nothing to write home about. Overall it is a good meal solid meal but not something to write home frantically (or on yelp) about. If there is a next time I'll order more of the sides to see how creative Mina was with his menu but for now it was good but nothing tugs at me to return."

I have had better, but on a 1-10 scale, it was a 8.5. The truffle macaroni & cheese is a wonderful accent. When in season, they have a fantastic corn side dish as well. For me, the highlight of all three evenings I've eaten here was the scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and carmelized onions. All I have to say is OMG! This could be an entree. Unreal. I want to cry thinking about it. On a 1-10, this dish for me was a 9.5 (10 doesn't exist). Finally... another chart topper, the Beignets! Wow! They are served warm and they have two sauces with them... a butterscotch (amazing), a creme brulee (pretty good), and my favorite, the chocolate (which sadly they for some reason no longer serve - crazy!) Overall, an amazing experience every time."

We had late reservations, like 9:00PM and were starving and very thirsty at this point. \n\nTo our surprise they brought out some complimentary duck fat fries, which were fantastic. My hubby excused himself to the rest room and by the time he returned I managed to polish off the rest of these addictive lil slices of heaven ; ) \n\nTo get on with it, we both ordered a couple of glasses of wine and shared the tuna, trio of poppers for an appetizer (which was very good). I believe the hubby ordered a bone-in rib eye and I had the salmon because I had steak the previous night...yeah, yeah, I realize its a steakhouse!  My salmon was delish, but the hubbies steak was a lil too done. I told him to send it back, but he opted not too and just ate it instead. We shared the truffled mac & cheese, which was also a delight to eat! I don't remember if we got a dessert or not, but we definitely had another glass of wine. \n\nOverall, we got out of there just under $250 including tip and I think it was well spent!

As far as customer service goes, this is the best I've experienced. Ashley really made me feel welcomed.\n\nI ordered the maine crab chowder and the lobster fritter:\n\nCrab Chowder: this soup was fantastic. The chunks of crab in the soup were huge and incredibly fresh. The soup itself was silky smooth, flavorful and reminded you of the sea.\n\nLobster fritter: these fritters were also really good. they look like miniature corn dogs but with bacon wrapped lobster in a light batter. Per Ashley's instructions, you are to squeeze the lime onto the fritter, then dabble a good amount of creme fresh, and then wrap it in butter lettuce. The results were short of genius. The butter lettuce gave it a good balance to offset any oiliness the batter may have. \n\np.s. Order the raspberry martini. It was strong as shit. next time, i'm definitely going to order the filet tartare and the kobe shabu shabu.\n\nOld Review: I ordered the now legendary American Kobe Rib Cap with Truffled Mac N Cheese. The server also brought out a complimentary trio of fries: truffle, herb, and cajun. The truffle aioli was out of this world. Unfortunately, I can't be this complimentary with the rest of the meal.\n\nLet's start with the Truffled Mac N Cheese. This was a great dish. It wasn't too creamy and it wasn't too runny. The consistency was perfect. The cheese wasn't overpowering, so the truffle was able to shine through.\n\nMy problem with STRIPSTEAK was their overrated Kobe Rib Cap. What I received was way too salty. With a steak valued at nearly $70, I expected perfection. I do give them props for the way they cooked the steak though. The crust was crisp, and the center was tender. It would be a great piece of meat if they didn't dump a ton of salt on it."

The husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice little dinner. We were super happy to know that this place also has happy hour so we showed up for that. \n\n* I ordered their white sangria. Unfortunately I should have maybe ordered some wine. The sangria was not tasty because it was soooo sweet. Not my type of drink but maybe others would like it. I would say skip the sangria and stick to wine or beer.\n* We ordered the smoked hummus for appetizers. That hummus was good! You had the nice smokey taste in it without being overwhelming. The pita bread was tasty too and warm. \n\nAs for dinner:\n* We were hoping to get their prefixed dinner but unfortunately we found out after seating down for dinner that they no longer had it. We were started with their well known complimentary duck fat fries that are served with different dipping sauces. I love fries so no matter what, I knew they would be good!\n* We also ordered the yellow tail sashimi. Super duper, fresh, served with a bit of cucumber slices and some crispy rice and a little hint of chili. Best yellow tail I've ever had! I would have been one happy girl with two more orders of this all for myself (and I'm not one to choose fish over beef). $22\n * For main dish we ordered 8oz of mishima reserved wagyu rib eye. This is the first time I've ever had wagyu and it for sure set the standards high. The meat was cooked to perfected and to order. Way juicy and oh so very tender. $69\n* We ended our dinner with the beignets! These are so not the disneyland beignets we know but holy crap are they bomb! That macallan 18 butterscotch sauce, I want to swim in it! That sauce that sauce that sauce!!!! I am not even a btuterscotch person so I am glad I gave it a shot with an open mind because I was blown away! Highly recommened!\n\nWhen they give you the check, they give you a little bag of popcorn on the house. Nice little extra touch. \n\nGreat place for a date!

StripSteak also have great fries, everyone on my table liked but I don't really remember how it taste like, it's just special, one of the specialty you have to have at this restaurant.  This place is definitely more expensive than most of the steak restaurants in LV, they even tell you it's about $110 per person averagely, but if you are looking to eat at a nice steak restaurant with great steak in Las Vegas regardless of the price, this place is the place to go!

I highly recommend to anyone visiting this restaurant.  \nThe atmosphere is great, the people and the staff were very friendly and the drinks were great.\n\nThe Cons\nOur services was very mediocre we had a party of 5 we were not very demanding at all, but for some reason our server didn't seem to be very attentive to us.  Poor customer service can ruin your whole experience.  \n\nOur server somewhat forced me into getting the wagyu rib cap after I told him that I wanted the wagyu  ribeye and I didn't appreciate that.

I guess he was looking for a bigger tip.  \nThe sides were just okay, we ordered the mac and cheese truffle and we had ordered the spinach souffl\u00e9 and it came out undercooked, they took it back and brought it back to the table once we were all finished with our food.  \n\nOverall:  The restaurant was okay, the experience could have been better but the food was okay.

In this case we are talking about a Vegas, and you only get one shot to impress and hope people spread the word about your Steak house. My wife and I decided to have dinner here after we watched the Michael Jackson show in the hotel. The host escorted us to the table and said a server will be with us shortly. (no problem) 10 mins goes by and nobody is yet to stop by our table. Finally the same host saw that we hadn't been helped. So he brings up a dinner and drink menu. Takes our order for the drink and they come. Now we are just back to sitting around waiting for our server to come by.  I then pull out my cell phone and start the stopwatch on it. 23 MINS later our server comes by. Proceeds to tell us about the menu. At this point my wife and I had 33 mins to decide on what we wanted for dinner. We were ready to order. We place our order and move on. The food finally comes out (another server brings it to us). I had to ask that server for the Fries that come on the house because our server never came back or brought them. I ordered the 16oz NY Strip and my wife ordered the Filet Mignon. My steak was \"good\" at best, certainly wasnt a USDA Prime Steak. We shared the Potatoe Gratin. That was about the only good thing about this place. I could go on but I was very disapointed in everything at Stripsteak. I'll stick to my local place, Peterson's Steakhouse in Indianapolis."

(It's fairly easy to tell the difference between the two types of restaurants, just watch for the rich old guys wheeling their oxygen tanks towards the former.)\n\nI went for the lamb, my colleagues for the strip steaks.  Entrees check in around $50-ish.  All were expertly prepared.  For sides, we shared the spinach souffle (excellent, imaginative), the creamed spinach with bacon (good, but a bit ordinary), and a baked potato (not much you can do to sex that up).\n\nIf you want a good, large hunk of cow before you go out to hit the bars, StripSteak will get you in that mood.  If you want a quiet, relaxing dinner, the atmosphere may overwhelm.  But the quality of the food matches the prices."

Our waiter was awesome, the drinks were superb, the food was top notch, and the ambiance was great! No complaints about Stripsteak at all.\n\nFor cocktails I highly recommend the Cucumber Martini and the Moscow Mule. Both of those drinks were phenomenal. Their drink menu is an iPad with a really cool interface that allows you to easily browse all their drinks.\n\nWe were served complimentary fries upon our arrival, since there were five of us, they brought two servings of them. All the fries are cooked in duck fat and seasoned differently, I know for sure one was truffle, but I don't recall the others. The dipping sauces were great, one was truffle, one was mustard, and the other I don't remember, but everything was delish.\n\nI split the lobster bisque with my stepmom, so they gave each of us a small bowl. My favorite lobster bisque was at Craftsteak, but they can move over, because my new favorite is at Stripsteak. Love, love, loved this bisque! \n\nI ordered the grilled diver scallops, which were delicious and reasonable. Four large scallops for under $40 is a pretty good deal, especially in Vegas. They are mesquite grilled and they were wonderful. \n\nI sampled everybody else's food, all of it was amazing!\n\nHalibut - Also mesquite grilled, light touch of lemon. Perfect.\nKing Crab Legs - Served with drawn butter and lemon, and they removed the shells for my sister in law, very nice of them!\nDry Aged Bone-In Ribeye - Only one person ordered steak at the steakhouse, lol, but it was one of the best ribeye's I have ever tasted. I would get that if I come again.\nAmerican Wagyu Burger - Awesome burger with a really good mustard flavor to it.\n\nFor sides we shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with Peas, Potato Gratin with Gouda Sauce, and the Creamed Corn with Jalapeno. All amazing. The portions appeared to be pretty small, but they were actually perfect considering all the other food we had, we ended up leaving some of the sides behind.\n\nFor dessert with ordered the Beignets with the trio of sauces. We were given six light, airy, hot beignets with a very scotchy butterscotch sauce, a creme brulee sauce, and a chocolate pudding sauce. Mmmmm, I would come back to this restaurant just to get dessert again!\n\nDinner was $600 after tip, for five people, lots of cocktails, entrees, sides and dessert. Pricey, but about what to expect when you come to a nice steakhouse in Vegas. I hope to dine here again someday!"

The potato puree was great (the sour cream was okay, the lobster was delicious, and I hated the horseradish).  The lamb itself was okay, not amazing but not bad either.  However, I'm very picky about risotto and this risotto was not cooked well.  Over-seasoned with too much salt, and yet under-seasoned / bland at the same time.  Additionally, I could feel uncooked rice kernels, so it wasn't cooked properly.\n\nI generally use risotto as my measure of whether a restaurant is really doing gourmet right, and I don't think this one passed."

For the food I had a shrimp cocktail which came with 5 decent sized shrimp. They were great. Husband had the lobster tacos appetizer and he said they were the best thing ever! He loved them. \n\nWe both had the filet. For $59 you would expect it to be perfectly cooked and look like a great cut of meat. Well that was not the case. My filet looked like a hacked up piece of meat on a plate. For a steak house you expect it to look edible. I was a little weary too because I ordered medium and it came out more rare to medium rare. That being said the flavor was good. Needed more seasoning but I ate most of it. Not overly impressed for a Michael Mina restaurant\n\nSides were great. I'd skip the fried sweet potatoes. While they are shoe string they had almost a powdery taste but the spicy fried rice, mushrooms and Mac and cheese were all excellent sides the four of us at them all minus the sweet potatoes. \n\nThe s'mores for dessert was insane! Not to sweet but just right. The tapioca had a great presentation with fresh fruit that added that extra touch. Really good. \n\nI won't say I won't be back but with hundreds of other restaurants in Vegas...this may be a one time and try something else place but I wouldn't be upset if someone suggested going."

The ceiling light displays playing swirls of water like some giant screen saver were mesmerizing.\n\nThe plaster imprint of an Asian street on the wall. The teak brick wall dividers, the glass booth seperators and the salvaged hull of a ship. All of it just to delight your eyes.\n\nWonderful!\n\nMy server Glenn was brilliant. Kind, knowledgeable, friendly, always smiling.  His service was top notch!  I took many of his recommendations.\n\nComplimentary Duck Fat Fries....these are just crack for fat kids.... I was really surprised at how good something like \"fries\" can be. I was happy with how delicious they were. \n\nI started with the Sweet Onion Soup. OMG I was seriously considering licking the bowl dry.... I was very angry at the shape of the bowl! Because it's hard to get out every delicious drop.\n\nIt's creamy and thick without being clumpy and the golden flavour of the onions are strong without overpowering. It's just ridiculously good.\n\nI also got a La Poire Martini, to sip on. Refreshing and so clean. I want that recipe! Hell I want all their recipes.\n\nFor main course I chose the Colorado Lamb. I have NEVER had lamb so good before. It was juicy, tender, the RIGHT amount of fat to complement its flesh. The jus was delicious. I was having to hold myself back from going feral and just picking up the bones with my hands and ripping into it :)\n\nStupid manners...and forks...\n\nI chose a side of Mac and Cheese. SO GOOD. Sinfully good, I was like I'm so putting this in my purse to take home, good. Creamy, and gooey and the right bite of sharp and creamy cheeses.  Noodles were perfection.\n\nI got a cute bag of popcorn for my complimentary desert. What a lovely gesture.\n\nI had a wonderful time, the staff brilliant, the meal unforgettable, the ambience is exactly what I want when I go to an amazing dinner. \n\nI found Stripsteak on restaurant.com and I'm so glad I did, because now I have every reason to go back every time I'm back in Vegas!\n\nThank you for a wonderful night."

I wish they weren't so yummy because I could not come close to finishing my meal.\n\nFoccacia - eh.  Everything else was better, so skip this and save room for the good stuff.\n\nI got the beet salad with burratta cheese.  I must confess that I love burratta.  I want to take it home and cuddle with it.  When my husband asked for a bite of it, I had a serious internal debate before I decided that sharing was good for my marriage.  The beets were also delicious, but this was all about the cheese for me.  My husband got the wedge salad which was good but not anything out of the ordinary.\n\nFor dinner, I got the skirt steak and husband got the short rib.  The short rib was delicious and tender and well sauced.  But I won with the skirt steak.  Meltingly tender, deliciously seasoned.  We also got the scalloped potatoes and the mushrooms which were both fabulous, but the meat was totally the star.\n\nWe also had an excellent Spanish Rioja (a new kick we're on) recommended by the sommelier.  It was so good in fact, we reminisced about it the next night as we sat at the bar at Il Mulino while waiting for our table.  So good, that we determined that if the hostess couldn't get her act together and get us seated by the end of our cocktails, we would pay the check and hop in a cab back over to Mandalay.\n\nSo our second meal at Stripsteak was just as good.  I pretty much got the same thing again, but with the truffled mac n cheese instead of the potatoes.  Oh my was that good mac n cheese.  I will dream about that meal.\n\nMy husband got the bisque and the lamb and thoroughly enjoyed.  But we still agreed that the skirt steak was one of the best meats ever.\n\nI give this 5 yummy stars.  Twice."

Food, service, price!\nNow on to the actual review:\n5:30pm reservation time, showed up early for a little HH cocktail and was promptly seated for dinner soon thereafter. Our server, although very soft spoken and a little difficult to hear, was attentive and nice! He gave us the perfect amount of time to order, and the food started to flow out of the kitchen.\nCompliments from the chef: duck fat fries: hello?!? Heaven in my mouth!\n1st course: Kobe beef tartare- beautiful presentation! Tartare came out on a plate with the quail egg set atop with all the mix ins surrounding. Our food runner gracefully mixed the tartare and placed it in a chilled glass. Grilled pita bread to go with. We both decided that the pita bread and the tartare were great........ Separately! The pita bread masked the steak when eated together.\n2nd course (his): wedge salad: wow! Crispe cups of iceberg lettuce, bacon, blue cheese dressing (which was not too \"blue cheesy\"), and pickled shallots.\n2nd (mine): hearts of romaine, which I automatically pegged for their version of a caesar salad. It was and it wasn't. The menu states \"olive\" dressing....... After my first bite, I remembered that olives are not my most favorite....... My fault!\nMain entree (his): rack of lamb. Perfect mid-rare with the most incredible rosemary sauce drizzled over the top.\nMine: grilled scallops: cooked nicely...... Nothing over the top. My very last bite did have a grain of sand which sends chills down my spine, but it was just the one. I appreciate the work, talents, and dedication of the prep all the cooks/ chefs to back there do before service starts. One graine of sand won't kill me.\nSides: Brussels sprouts with bacon-de-lish! Potato pur\u00e9e: sour cream- average, lobster- incredible, horseradish- in between.\nDessert (his): beignets with 18 yr scotch butterscotch pudding- the pudding was amazing. You got all the favors of both the scotch and the butterscotch. Perfect pair!\nMine: mascarpone cheesecake: the best cheesecake I've ever had! Huckleberry compote, shortbread crumble, and candied kumquat peel...... Amazing!\nall savory food came out very quickly, almost too quickly. By the time dessert came around, service drastically slowed down. As I stated at the beginning of this review, I'm in the industry, so I see both sides of it.\nAt the end of the day, would I go back? Absolutely!!!\nOther reviews state that the price is to high, blah, blah,...... But you need to remember, you're not just paying for that steak on a plate..... You're paying for the technique of food preparation, service and everything in between. So, if you're worried about how much money you're going to spend, don't go out to a restaurant like this because you'll leave pissed off when in all actuality everything was great until the bill was dropped. \nI left happy! :)"

            "review": "StripSteak is a fine steakhouse but, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the hype.\n\nI'll start with something positive.  The ambience, to be expected, is excellent.  Good use of wood, and in an open, non-stuffy, modern way.  \n\nThey start you off with some complimentary french fries and potato bread.  The fries are gourmet (one kind is cooked in duck fat) and are good, but not great.  (In fact, I had some McDonalds fries the next afternoon which left me just as satisfied).  The bread is a bit dry.  I would never order it.\n\nAs for the drinks, I had a glenlivet 12 (can't report much there) and a cucumber martini.  The cucumber martini was perfect for a hot Vegas day (95 degrees) and was refreshing.  I also haven't been to too many places that offer a cucumber martini, so that was nice.  As for the drink itself, it was un-nuanced.  Overall, though, I'd get it again.\n\nOnto the steaks.  I've been on a wagyu kick lately and like to compare the different restaurants that offer it, so I was glad to see they offered it here.  The price is supposedly market, so on this night, it was $185 for a 6 oz. New York.  In short, I was disappointed.  First, they serve it pre-sliced.  That pissed me off.  Pre-slicing alters the surface/area ratio, which means that each slice gets cold quickly.  I tried to return the steak to get a new one that wasn't pre-sliced, but the most they would do was \"flash\" the steak.  B.S.  In any event, the steak itself fell way below expectations.  Unlike CUT, the wagyu at StripSteak did not melt in my mouth and I still had to chew (ok, at CUT you do have to chew, but barely).  I would never order the wagyu here again.\n\nI went with four other guys and none of them were impressed with their steaks (they don't even go to nice steakhouses often).  In fact, one said that the steak at Lawry's \"destroyed\" the steak at StripSteak.  That gives you some context.\n\nOn the other hand, StripSteak's truffled macarroni and cheese was truly divine.  In all seriousness, and forgive me for the superlatives, it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had, and by a wide margin.  For the truffled mac & cheese alone, I would go back to StripSteak.  If you go, it is a must order.\n\nFinally, and it must be said since I'm a guy, the other reason to go to StripSteak is that one of their servers, Tori, is perhaps the prettiest girl you will ever see in real life.  I'm really not joking on that one (it was the consensus amongst the 5 guys at my table, as well as the table of 8 guys sitting next to us).  Ridiculous.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, 3 solid stars for StripSteak.  Can't say it's the best steakhouse (or even close to it), but it is a place to grab a good meal with a nice ambience and pretty scenery."

            "review": "I hope to get through this review without drooling all over my laptop. \n\nSo I chose this place for My boyfriend's 30th birthday dinner, and it's one of those happy occasions where I cannot imagine a better choice.  As soon as we sat down in the plush chairs in the middle of the gorgeous but unpretentious dining room, and picked up the Happy Birthday card the establishment had written out to my beau, it felt right.\n\nThen we started sipping the best cocktails we've ever had.  Birthday boy tried the Claymore, an intriguing blend of Scotch, elderflower syrup, and Lambic beer. Sounded flat-out weird, but was out-of-this-world good. Just a little sweet and you could totally taste the smoothness of that good Scotch. \n\nBefore we order, we are presented with a trio of french fries with their own dipping sauces! Herb with Ketchup, Duck Fat with Truffle sauce, and Paprika with Barbecue. I'm afraid I'm gonna bust out another superlative. I don't wanna get discredited that way, but hot damn, these were best fries I'd ever had. Specifically the duck fat and truffle sauce. What can I say about those fries? When you ate them, the world fell away. It was just you, the fried potato, and the truffle sauce.\n\nBirthday boy picked an appetizer that the server recommended: Lobster and bacon fritters wrapped in bibb lettuce with a meyer lemon creme fraiche. Not my thing at all, but he was quite content with it. \n\nMeahwhile, I reveled in a fantastical salad of tri-colored beets with burrata. Do you know burrata? It's a fresh mozzarella that's made molten with cream.  It's hard to make, and its quite expensive. It's often flaunted on a menu as the star of a dish, but then miniscule in portion compared to the other ingredients. Not here, at Stripsteak! I enjoyed two healthy-sized, mouth-watering balls of exquisite burrata, which were complimented just perfectly with the lightly dressed roasted beets. At $15, this was a deal. \n\nBetween the cocktail, beets, and fries, I probably didn't need to consume much more, but then our steaks came. We both ordered filet mignon ($54). There was nothing MIGNON about these steaks, they were enormous! I ordered mine \"Rare- really rare\" and I was happy to see that the while the outside was seared dark, it was red and cold beyond a few millimeters. It was perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. \n\nNow, at Ruth Chris and the like, the $8 sides of sauteed vegetables or baked potatoes remind you of the expensive wrappings and bows you have to buy for a wedding gift. A necessary accompaniment to the main event that makes it pretty and complete, but would be utterly useless and ridiculous if purchased on their own. \n\nThe sides here at Stripsteak are NOT wrapping paper. You could bring a vegetarian to Stripsteak and they would be just as happy with these sides as the carnivores with their meat. \n\nTruffled Macaroni and cheese. **Maniacal laugh heard here at the mention of this dish.** According to our server, the best thing on the menu. No arguments here!\n\nWe also had Scalloped potatoes with goat cheese. Giving the mac a run for its money.\n\nIf that wasn't enough gluttony to invoke wrath from the Gods, we also had an accompaniment of grilled foie gras. Each bite bursted with sinful flavor as it instantly melted on our tongues. \n \nI cannot express to you how blessed we were to be eating these side dishes. It was pure, unfettered bliss. This is comfort-food that grew up to be a gorgeous, confident Gourmet. It's the best of both worlds. \n\nWe played happily with combining these flavors. This bite is filet with truffled mac. This bite is filet with goat cheese. This bite is filet with a bit of the roasted shallot, the most delicious garnish in town. \n\nAnd then there was the moment that I realized \"Hey! What about the trufffle dipping sauce from the fries? I bet that will taste good with the steak!\"\n\nI never thought I was going to be able to eat that enormous steak, but despite being at capacity, I ate and ate and ate until everything was gone. \n\nThe birthday boy chose beignets with chocolate mouse dipping sauce, not my thing, and then I happily paid the $300 bill. \n\nIt was worth it."

The scallion potato cakes weren't quite as good as previous visits, but still above average.       We tried the lobster fritters on recommendation.  They were tasty, but  a bit overwhelmed by the bacon.  I dipped some of the house fries into the creme fraiche that came with the fritters and it was excellent.  They should consider offering that up as a regular option.  Overall, it was another excellent meal from Michael Mina."

This isn't one of them, and I was so disappointed, because I had high expectations based on the experience I had at Michael Mina SF !\n\nService\nThe restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived at 5:30 pm. After we were seated and initially greeted by server#1, who stated that she would be serving us, things went downhill quickly. Ten minutes later, another server#2 approached us and asked if we had questions about the menu. After that, another server#3 dropped off fries. I never saw server#1 again. Another ten minutes waiting to order, I had to get up and go to the bar to request a server for our table. A different server promptly came over to take our order. I asked her if she was now our server, and she responded \"no\", but she would take our order. I lost it at that point and demanded to know who our server is. She was very nice and offered to be our server and she promptly informed the manager about our experience. From that point on, service was 100% better, but I had to ask for it. The manager was very apologetic about our experience and adjusted our bill accordingly. Will I go back? Probably not. Again, there are many steakhouses in Las Vegas that offer excellent food AND service. For a $500 restaurant bill, I expected a lot more."

Honestly I can't talk about much else right now, because I'm drooling all over my keyboard while I dream about it. How am I going to tell all the other Yelpers about the entire experience? I can't. TOO BAD! You'll just have to hear me go on and on and on... and on and on and on... about the pork belly. \n\nOkaaaaay fiiiiiine, I suppose I should help people figure out if they should dine here blah and try some steak or maybe blah eat some other dishes or wine dessert blah. I'll try to move on, I swear. Here goes nothing!\n\nFOOD:\n---------\nTo be honest, not much else stood out during this meal other than my soulmate (aka PB). Everything else was slightly underwhelming. \n\nSurprisingly, the complimentary **Duck Fat Fries** were pretty bomb, and the second best thing we ate here. Very light and crispy and goes well with any of the trio of sauces.\n\nSecond up was our appetizer, none other than the incredible! super edible! pork belly--its proper name being **Instant Bacon** ($22). See opening paragraph for my full assessment of this dish.\n\nSince this is a STEAK place, we figured we'd better order one. The **10 oz Prime Flat Iron** ($48) did not live up to expectations and was definitely not worth the cost. Even thought it was done medium, the meat was dry and lacked flavor. Super disappointing.\n\nFor side dishes--often the best part of any meal--we got the **Potato Gratin** ($17) which came with gouda and the **Creamed Spinach** ($14) topped with bacon streusel. Both were decent but neither really met my side dish hopes and dreams. However, they did make the steak easier to eat!\n\nThe **Vanilla Cheesecake** with strawberries and shantilly cream was the chef's special for the night. It was simply perfection. Thank you to executive pastry chef Monica Delgadillo for helping us end the night on the right note.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE:\n---------------------------\nThe storefront is super impressive with full glass panels and brightly lit signs indicating your dinner destination. Even the reception desk outside is lit up, so there's no question where you start your journey. The attire here is mixed, some in cocktail dresses and others in casual/business casual attire.\n\nFrom the hosts to the servers to the bussers, everyone was extremely pleasant. Our server was particularly helpful, especially since he's the one who alerted me to.... PORK BELLY!!!! aka Instant Bacon. I will be forever grateful. \n\nTIP: I would return here for (at least) three  --3-- Instant Bacons and the pastry's special dessert for the night.\n\nDATE TIP: You can test out someone new when you LOSE IT over the Instant Bacon."

Went this past weekend and have already made my reservations for my next trip in 2 weeks. \n\nSince everyone in my group was getting steaks, I decided to mooch off of them and indulge my self in other pleasantries. So I got the West Coast Kushi oysters - similar to Kumamotos - my fav. I also got the bone marrow - nothing spectacular - a bit plain actually, just the marrow and some toast. I like it when marrow is spruced up a bit with capers and greens. So I wont be ordering this again from here. I also wanted to get the Fois Grois but the waiter suggested the Pate. It was good, but wish I had gone with my previous choice. The Pate - since i was eating it by myself - was a bit too heavy for only one to consume, especially when paired with the rich taste of the marrow - my bad overall, I should have considered it. \n\nMy friend's Filet was AMAZING the most beautiful piece of meet you've ever seen. I will probably be getting that on ym next trip. My boyfriend's aged rib eye - rare - was succulent . My other friend got his rib eye med rare and it wa s bit too dry. We enjoyed a nice Syrah - $80, the lesser end of the list, but still lovely. \n\nThe scalloped potatoes were awesome, as was the jalapeno cream corn. The Sides there are a MUST - get as many as your stomach can handle! AND you may not think you have room for desert but share the coconut passion fruit sorbet plate with your table - you'll be glad you did. The tangy fruitiness is an excellent way to end the heaviness of the meal - along with a double espresso, of course, to kick you out of the coma."

The ambiance seemed sophisticated and inviting, so we gave it a try.  Mind you, we were not intending a full meal so we ordered a couple of appetizers.  The first was a steamed and chilled lobster cocktail for $24.  When the waiter brought it to our table, it was a major disappointment.  On top of a huge mound of crushed ice was HALF of a lobster tail about 3.5\" long and ONE claw about the same length.  What happened to the other half and claw #2?  \n\nIf I was a waiter, I would be ashame to deliver such a dish!  Worse yet, the taste was very bland and slightly overcooked.  Then it was time for appetizer #2 of triangular cut lettuce about 1.5 inches long and covered with a small portion of minced crab and what-not.  This was their lettuce cup dish of crab, but if the size does not disappoint you, the lack of crab taste cerrtainly will.  The free french fries and skillet bread did not justify the $50 check (tip included)!  \n\nThis was my first and LAST experience with StripSteak.  I accept the fact that prices are higher in Las Vegas, but the food lacked taste and was definitely short on quantity.\n\nAt least throwing $50 into a slot machine provides entertainment!"

On the bright side, the burger does come with another pile of those fries. The tomato soup is pretty good. It definitely has the heirloom tomato taste so the the soup is a little bitter. The lobster grilled cheese triangles are small, but tasty.\n\nMy date ordered the fried chicken, but was bummed to find out that they only fry it for parties or 2 or more.

Although the restaurant was empty we were sat uncomfortably close to another couple.  \n\nWould much rather spend $300+ on a steak in a much more intimate venue, but the food was good, better suited for a bachelors party than a date."

Our server was great: helpful with the menu, perfectly attentive and our water glasses were always full. We were offered complimentary fries in 4 different flavors before our meal, which were both delicious and unique. Ordered the filet, asparagus and potato gratin side dishes. YUM. Before coming here, I thought I knew how I liked my steak and how it should be cooked....but StripSteak just blew that idea out of the water and set the new standard for me. Melt in your mouth, full flavor perfection. Seriously. WOW. The merlot I ordered by the glass was also above & beyond, though I didn't catch the name after a few glasses. Oops. Also: by chance that evening, sitting across from basketball's Charles Barkley and his entourage was fun. All the more reason to go back again. LOVED IT!"

StripSteak is the restaurant I go to every time I go to Vegas when I am looking for a great steak. I have dinned here at least a dozen times in the last few years and I have yet to have a bad meal or one that does not meet my expectations.\n\nThe last time I dined there was March second, just prior to the Carrie Underwood concert as part of my birthday weekend. The experience I had was exceptional! They were very accommodating and the service was spectacular. My parents and I started the evening in the lounge for a couple of happy hour drink specials prior to our seating (we arrived early and prior to the opening of the main dining room). The happy hour drinks were well priced.\n\nOnce the main dining room opened, we were promptly seated by the hostess and our server was present to attend to us. He was exceptional with any questions that my parents had and dietary requests were received well and honored by the kitchen.The duck fat fries are a nice change to the regular bread and butter offerings of most restaurants.  We ordered a bottle of Joseph Phelps Opus One wine for our dinner and it was exceptional, but also costly... The wine list is exceptional for a steak house.\n\nWell all had appetizers of Salad. I always get the caesar salad (presentation changes every time) and the the Kansas City Striploin steak. My parents opted for a filet. All steaks cooked to perfection. We shared a couple of side dishes at the table and were also excellent.\n\nWe opted for a desert beverages as opposed to deserts. I opted for the Adult root bear float, which was likely kaluha and galliano with  a scoop of ice cream... Nice and refreshing. Though, as it was a birthday weekend, I did receive a complementary plate of ices cream with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate sauce.\n\nThere was an element of sticker shock with a tab of over $1,000.00, but worth the celebration of a milestone birthday."

They will ask you what your timing is, if you need to be somewhere. Also, make reservations at least ~24 hours in advance to ensure you get in when you want. Everyone needs to be there when you arrive for your reserved time.\n\nService: Fantastic- our server was a New England fan (we are from New England), so naturally we got along very well. He was spectacular in his recommendations for everything. \n\nFood: Delicious!\n\n- Pork Belly: If you are used to fatty, melt in your mouth pork belly, this is a bit different. It is smoked so not alot of fat on it but still good.\n\n-Caesar Salad: DELICIOUS starter and they do anchovies. Love this.\n-Cobb Salad: Also awesome option\n\n-Steaks: I did lamb but everyone else did Steak and it looked delicious. Everyone was happy with their choices.\n\n-Side: We did the Gratin Potatoes. It is a must- so cheesy and delicious.\n\nOverall: Will definitely be back if we go out again to Vegas!"

            "review": "Few things satisfy one's appetite in such a primal way as steak. And few chefs are as innovative with food as Michael Mina. So when searching for a place with an innovative approach to steak, StripSteak should have been a no brainer, right?\n\nAs it turned out, StripSteak was a bit of a letdown. The reason, however, is a little hard to pin down. Suffice it to say that I found the restaurant both overwhelming and underwhelming.\n\nWhat was overwhelming were the ways in which they attempted to \"bribe\" you into loving the restaurant. This begins the second you sit down, when they parade out to your table a Trio of Duck Fat Fries. Now who can resist duck fat fries? Clearly I was being manipulated here, and the truffle oil fries did just that. That said, because they bring them out to every table, while lying in wait for their next victim, the fries don't come out as hot and fresh as they could be. In addition to the fries, they also bring out to your table a cast iron pan of potato focaccia bread, which was delicious but dense. All this before even getting our appetizers!\n\nFor our meal, we both opted for the prix fixe menu, which is a fair deal at $55.\n\n1st Course\n\nMaryland Blue Crab Chowder | Bacon Lardon, Parsnip -- Intense crab flavor but a little watery. Not my favorite.\n\nBibb Wedge | Avocado, Bacon, Oregon Smokey Blue  -- Good flavor, but I felt like I have had this before. Surprisingly staid for Michael Mina. In fact, both these dishes were really underwhelming.\n\n2nd Course\n\nSlow-Poached Prime Rib of Beef | Select Seasonal Side Dishes -- The meat was well cooked, but honestly, I have made better prime rib at home. The side dishes consisted of a wonderful brussels sprouts slaw, a predictable truffled mac and cheese, and an insipid creamed spinach.\n\nDry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye ($10 surcharge) -- This was delicious, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. Now this is the reason that one comes to a steakhouse, not for all the distractions and bribes. And this is the reason I brought the 2006 Scarecrow Cabernet Sauvignon ($35 corkage), which paired perfectly with the meat.\n\n3rd Course\n\nMichael's Root Beer Float | Sassafras Ice Cream, Chocolate Chip Cookies  -- Pure yum! I could have had a pitcher of this.\n\nFinally, as if this wasn't enough, before you leave and write your Yelp review, they present you with a bag of Chocolate Almond Brittle. Again, a bribe.\n\nThe service was for the most friendly and unpretentious, with the exception of the person who came to open and decant our wine (I don't think he was the somm). He seemed a little snotty and did not smile at all.\n\nSo would I come back again? Probably not, but I did enjoy some aspects of our meal. The next time I'm in Las Vegas and want to do a Michael Mina restaurant, I'll head to Nobhill Tavern instead."

The meal started out promising enough with the yummy duck fat fries trio and the tuna tartare poppers trio.  Then the spinach souffle came out which turned out to be more cake than vegetable.  The waitress had recommended this after my husband said that we wanted a vegetable.  Cake cooked with vegetable doesn't exactly count in my book.  I ordered a the Kobe skirt steak which was too salty and too raw on one end and overdone on the other.  The salty seasoning upset my stomach.  My husband ordered the prime rib which was decent enough but nothing really special.  We did enjoy the creme fraiche horseradish though.  As my stomach was acting up, I didn't order dessert just some mint tea to settle the tummy.\n\nThe worst thing was the foccacia bread.  It tasted doughy and wet like it was undercooked.  We sent it back telling them that and they brought out a new basket that tasted slightly better but not much.  I thought it was strange that it tasted so bad.  Not sure what was going on there.   \n\nMaybe it was an off night but the food was really disappointing.  The service was good but I think there is such a thing as checking in too often with your customers.  Eh...I don't think I'd go back unless something changes."

We decided to go to StripSteak because they were staying at Mandalay Bay so he made reservations for us plus his coworkers family.  The restaurant itself is very modern and ambience is comfortable.  They had large open windows showing the dry aging process for the steak and jars along the wall that looked like picked vegetables.  The staff was welcoming and seemed very knowledgeable.  They even had a sommelier that helps you order wine that best fits your tastes and food order.  \n\nWe ordered the yellowtail sashimi, instant bacon, and the crispy rice poppers for appetizers and a bottle of pinot noir to start.  The sashimi was so good we asked for a few more orders.  It's also beautifully plated with the cucumbers, peppers and yuzu ponzu sauce and the flavors just work so well together.  The crispy rice poppers were just okay, but my dad compared the crispy rice to a hashbrown.  I didn't care for the flavors on the pork belly, but it was really tender.  \n\nFor our main course, everyone ordered their choice of a steak and we shared the potato gratin, creamed spinach, broccolini, and mac & cheese.  I ordered the Mishima Wagyu filet mignon and it came plated with a bite of cornbread with some spicy honey.  The sides were all pretty standard and tasty.  There was so much cheese everywhere which I loved.  The steak was just average and the reason for the low rating.  I ordered mine medium rare because I love having the inside of the steak softer and juicier, but it was really dry and kind of hard to eat.  I think it may have been too overdone so I lost a lot of the flavor I love in tender filet mignons.  I could tell my dad didn't enjoy his either because he only ate about a quarter of his steak, which never really happens.  We've definitely had better at other steakhouses on the strip for this price."

And the coloration is not appetizing.  \n\nBut let's get on to what they do well.  The service here has always been amazing!  I have also had one of the most unique sides anywhere in the spinach soufflet.  The atmosphere is beautiful, and the restaurant has great energy.  More of what's good here - I have had the 4oz kobe and short rib entr\u00e9e, it was amazing.  I had the wagyu filet, sliced to serve, also amazing.\n\nI just wish there was a way to let guests know that ordering any regular steak from the menu is not taken seriously in the kitchen.  But if you spend an extra 20 bucks or more to get a premium selection, you will find yourself with a steak house quality meal.  \n\nUnfortunately, I think regular steak is priced to pay for the decor and atmosphere.

The gratin was phenomenal. It's very indulgent and filling. I don't recommend it for those watching their weight (if they are then this ain't the city for them).\n\nWe each had the wagyu rib cap. Interesting story behind this. There are only two places in Vegas to get this. The chef from Stripsteak is now the chef at Gordon Ramsey. Though it was excellent, I didn't have the heart to tell the person I was with that I liked the one at GR Steak a little more. And it's like $20 cheaper there.\n\nThere was a small issue with the meal and although we didn't complain they took the side dish off the tab. Overall the service was perfect.\n\nI have now tried CraftSteak, Stripsteak, Mastro's, GR Steak, Prime, Hugo's Cellar (though I was last there 25 years ago), Jean Georges, and a few others. They are all great and offer something unique and nice. Can't really go wrong with any of them."

Bobby Flay was at the table next to ours with his crew. Raj as usual has put together a nice wine list though we all found it a bit strange that there are so many Austrian Rieslings' at a restaurant that revolves largely around meat and more meat. Maybe I am missing something... I found the food a bit mediocre particularly for the price ($36 for skirt steak or $50 for a filet. The Kobe beef started at $50 for American to $195 for Japanese, all ala carte.) The many sides of potatoes were nearly the consistency of a soup with some actually bleeding liquid when dished on to the plates. The mac n cheese though very tasty with the truffle oil was dry with absolutely no creaminess ever being apparent. The foie gras \"sliders\" though tasty and a very large portion of liver did not quite translate. The sweet potatoe mash was so dosed up on clove as to make it unedible.  For dessert we had the mini doughnuts with a trio of sauces. The sauces were tasty but unfortunately the doughnuts were over cooked and very dry. Service however was exceptional and friendly.\n\nFor wine we had a great bottle of 2004 Freeman Akiko's Cuvee.\nThe Akiko's Cuvee has always been my favorite Freeman wine besides the chardonnays and last night was no exception. We popped and poured and she was away to the races right away. Out of the gate this wine has a haunting nose of cherries, cranberry and black licorice with baking spice and a touch of shitake mushroom. The palate is incredibly silky with super fine tannins with. Everyone at the table called it soft. Sweet ripe fruits are in abundance but the fine tannins keep them in check. The oak in this bottle is much more integrated than the last bottle I had providing an immensely seamless pleasurable experience.\n91+pts\n$115 on the list there"

Get this, I was able to remember her birthday, I remembered to make reservations AND I had my suit clean in the closet!  This Ladies and Gentlemen is my personal trifecta.  \n\nWe walked into Mandy Bay and were greeted by the uber  friendly hostess.  With the dress she was wearing I'm surprised there wasn't a brass pole nearby. My icy cool composure kept my wife from throwing a Krav Maga style elbow to my head. But regardless, the male portion of my brain registered Awesome.(That was possibly an inapproriate thought on a special occasion. I sowwy) Anyhow,  We ended up with the most amazing romantic table in the back of the restaurant, tucked away and quiet.  \n\nOur busser was quick to come by to get our drink orders and our waiter was close behind with the specials of the evening.  We ordered the filet and ribeye with the mac & cheese and spinach souffl\u00e9.  A Few minutes go by and the free wickedly good fries showed up.  BAZINGA! I ended up having to go the little boys room and upon my return I was stopped dead in my tracks by the death gaze from my wife. I mean laser beams, ears with steam coming out of them, the works! \nI looked around and now sat next to us was a table full of screaming satan's spawn. 6 of them and the parents. AT STRIPSTEAK? ARE YOU F'ing SERIOUS?  \nThe death stare got the attention of the waiter who looked over and said we will get you another table:) As he turned, all of our food was coming out. He told the other waiters that we were moving and the food went back.  A few short minutes later we were in our new quiet serene home and the food arrived perfectly. The wait staff and management was amazing. Even if the food was craptastic I'd still come back because of how great they were to us. \nWe both enjoyed our steaks, which were seasoned perfectly and very tender but I still prefer N9ne or Brand for my carnivorous tastebuds. The sides were amazing, the Sommelier was on the money and place was just great. We will certainly be back and we will add it to our nom nom rotation. \n\nEat here, you won't be disappointed."

But for $400 a couple, your diners expect a better customer experience. \n\nWe had a 9 pm reservation and opted for the tasting menu ($320 per couple with wine pairing). Even with the crowd tapering down, service was rushed and we were barely halfway through one glass of wine before the next course and pour were dropped on our table. Wines were good. Champagne and Viognier quite nice; main course wine was a very nice Mas du Daumas Gassac vin du pays.\n\nThere was virtually no service attention between courses, other than water refills and table clearance. Not that there was any time for attention, given how rushed everything was.\n\nWith respect to food, oysters were tiny but good. Second course, ravioli, was chewy and tasted a bit stale. Main course, skirt steak and Australian lobster tail, was ok. Steak quite good, lobster over cooked and meaty. Best part of the meal, I'm afraid, was the complimentary duck-fat French fries. \n\nAmbience is poor. The dining room looks like a slightly more stylish than average coffee shop. We endure the piped-in thumper music of the Mandalay Bay food and beverage concourse throughout our entire meal.\n\nMaybe this was a bad night to go to dinner. Unfortunately, with so many great dining options in LV, it's very unlikely I'll have time to give you guys a second chance."

I've only ever had amazing cuts of steak here. There is a special procedure they use to cook it that they are very willing to explain. They are gluten-free friendly and knowledgable, they make everything from scratch so if an item does include a glutenous ingredient they can make it without it. My favorite part about this place is the complimentary duck fat fries in lieu of bread. You get three different kinds with three different sauces, and they are amazing! I like the atmosphere and it was quiet enough to have a conversation (when you are not eating the delicious foods of course!). Timing of service is great and they are accommodating if you have somewhere to be by a certain time (a show, etc). This restaurant is at the top of my must-go list when visiting Las Vegas!"

            "review": "Great steak places are a mix of not only excellent food, but excellent service to back.  Stripsteak meets those requirements, but does not differentiate itself from other steak houses enough to make the visit necessarily worth repeating.\n\nI settled in with two of my companions on a Sat night with no reservations (always a worry) but the service was able to snag us a corner table.  Perfect.\n\nThe restaurant started us off with some complimentary duck fat fries with three dipping sauces (in-house ketchup, old bay, and truffled aioli).  I've never been able to taste a significant difference in duck fat fries vs regular fries, and this was no different, but let me assure you, those fries were very tasty.\n\nAmerican Bone-in Ribeye - An excellent peace of beef, cooked perfectly to medium rare.  While the price was a bit high for the size IMHO, it had a nice sear on the outside and was juicy/flavorful throughout making it an enjoyable meal.  But true to my statement above, I've had great steaks before.  This is a great steak, but didn't stand out more than other great steaks I've had.  18oz bone in for $52.\n\nTruffled mac and cheese - Again, very tasty mac and cheese, and the truffled flavor was excellent.  A strong choice, but not anything that is phenomenal or mind-blowing to speak of.  \n\nPotato puree trio - Great concept: three types of flavored mashed potatos served side by side.  The lobster mashed had a few small chunks of lobster in it (so my companion told me, as I didn't get any lobster bites in the three spoonfuls I tried) and was interesting to taste.  The sour cream and onion was a pretty standard flavor, that probably could've used a slightly stronger seasoning as it tastes nearly plain compared to the other two.  The horseradish was easily the best tasting, and one of the standouts during dinner.  Something as simple as horseradish added to well made potato puree made it a really standout.  \n\nBeingets with vanilla creme brulee - Crisp on the outside giving way to soft pillow interior, the beingets were fried perfectly with a dusting of sugar.  And the vanilla creme brulee provided a perfect sugar crust on top to crak, and had a perfectly smooth creme inside that made every bite enjoyable.  This dessert had great execution, and was delicious.\n\nFinally, at the end of the meal, they provided two complimentary bags of peppered caramel popcorn to take home with us.  The popcorn was tasty, and the complimentary final note was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the popcorn about an hour later, and the texture had staled only sligthtly compared to freshly made, but it was a nice reminder of the meal we just had.\n\nVerdict:  A very solid steak restaurant and worth checking out.  They attempt to differentiate by using wood to grill (thus infusing the flavor of the wood into the meat) but to be honest, I can't taste a significant difference.  Service was top notch, food was top notch, and the overall experience was great.  Would I be back?  Possibly, to enjoy a good meal, but having had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great steak places, it's hard to warrant traveling to Vegas and coming by here again when there are so many other options of great food to try.  Great experience!"

Pricey! It was the most expensive steak I've ever had.  Although I prefer Filet, if it's really A5, it should be just as tender as a Filet.   I think the Wagyu at CUT at the Palazzo is A3, but don't hold me to that. \n\nI decided to risk it, and I arrived on a Tuesday Eve around 6pm w/o reservations.  I was seated on arrival.  The booth was very comfortable with fluffy pillows.   \n\nInstead of bread, they served a complimentary trio of Duck Fat fries.  They each had different seasonings, and dipping sauces.  \n\nI liked the garlic sauce the best, it was very thin, and rich and I knew I was racking up the calories when I was eating it.   It was one of the best dipping sauces I've ever had. The fries themselves were maybe 3.5-4 star, not the best I've had, but better than average.  I usually don't use dipping sauces on my fries, but the garic dip was excellent.   \n\nThe fries were better than Wolfgang's CUT steakhouse french fry side dish. \n\nI ordered the A5 Japanese Ribeye Wagyu ($185) along with Foie Gras as a side ($19)\n\nIt came pretty fast.  The restaurant itself wasn't very busy.  I dropped by the night before around 830-9, and it looked alot busier.   The bar was packed, though.\n\nThe steak was good. It was very tender, as I expected.  Very buttery, and rich.  The seasoning was outstanding.  The steak came pre sliced in thin slices, about 8-10 pieces.  I suppose they can make sure it is cooked correctly throughout.   Mine came out medium rare, as requested.  \nCompared to the wagyu filet I tried at CUT in Beverly Hills, I have to say this comes very close to being the best steak I've ever had.  It was on Par, for sure... \n\nThe foie gras was maybe the best I've ever had! It was more tender than the steak, like butter, served hot, and was very rich.  It was well worth the $19.   \n\nI had no room for dessert, and nothing looked too appetizing to me. \nOverall, a very outstanding meal for a very expensive price.   Bring your wallet, the total with tax and tip was nearly $270.  That is for just 1 person. The soda is $4 a pop w/ no freebie refills."

TOO SALTY among a few other things lost points for me.  \nFirst, when entree' items are over $50 I expect an elegant decor and atmosphere.  I felt like we were in a cafe' and not in a first class restaurant. \nFor starters we had their fries and a hamachi appetizer.  Both had excellent flavors but TOO MUCH SALT.  I called the waiter over and said. \"I can tell by the starters, that your chef is a little heavy handed with the salt.  Please tell him no added salt on my chicken\"  Unfortunately the chicken was salty too.   \nThe cardinal rule in chicken is don't overcook to dryness.  In an effort to not cross that line,  the chicken was just a FRACTION undercooked.  Slightly PINK meat. A little less salt and 2 more minutes cooking and this flavorful chicken would have been PERFECT. \nthe sides of truffle mac n' cheese, mushrooms and cream corn were all good, but not spectacular. \nRick had the Kansas steak.  cooked nicely and fresh and flavorful.  However I overheard both parties on either side of us complaining that their steak was overcooked to their order.  \nThe Desert was the saving grace for me,  PERFECT petite creme' brulee' and good beignets .\nThe service was good, even though they changed my fork settings 3 times.  Poor dishwasher to have to wash 7 forks per customer!\nOverall it was enjoyable, and and like I said, could have easily got to 5 stars with just a little more care salt and preparation."

The place was not full and we saw our waiter only about 4 times throughout that hour and a half.  We did complain to the manager who comped part of our meal, although she seemed to think the wait was not excessive.  The food was also not up to par for the cost.  Two people ordered the rib-eye and both were disappointed.  The other two ordered the filet mignon which was much better.

Luckily, we were able to get a table without reservations at 7:00pm on a Monday night. They sat us at a nice table, right in the middle of the action. It's a tad loud in there so bring your listening skills. \n\nAfter you are seated and given the menu, they bring out three little containers with french fries and dipping sauces. Now these are not your McDonald's fries. These are the most amazing fries you will ever have. \n\nThe first one had french fries with old bay seasoning and a mustard herb dipping sauce. \n\nThe second one had french fries with oregano and ketchup. \n\nThe third one was knock-your-socks off amazing.

The difference? east coast are \"larger and briny-er\", west coast are \"smaller and sweeter\" according to our server. \nThe oysters were delicious! They had came with cocktail sauce, lemon, and other toppings. The cocktail sauce had some nice horseradish in it for the perfect combination. \n\nWedge Salad- bleu cheese, bacon & polenta croutons, red chili cucumbers. I was told that it was disappointing as the bleu cheese dressing didn't have any bleu cheese chucks and tasted \"like it came out of the store\" \n\nMain- \n18 oz.

Heard that the marble was good and had great char on the steak. Nothing fancy just cooked perfect (medium-rare plus) \n\n16 oz. Kansas City Strip- great char, great flavor, all round good steak. \n\nDiver Scallops- which is what I ordered. Four deliciously tender, cooked perfectly, great flavored scallops. Seared nicely. \n\nSides- \nCreamed Spinach w/ bacon- I LOVE creamed spinach and this was up to par, but nothing crazy. The bacon doesn't really add anything to the dish. \n\nRoasted Maitake Mushrooms- great roasted mushrooms. Not much else to say. They are always a good side to seafood and steaks. \n\nWe had a couple of glasses of wine (a cab-combination) that was REALLY GOOD and I would order all day long! \n\nI cannot WAIT to go back for more duck fat and truffle and oysters and more food in general!"

I gave it two stars instead of one because the foie gras sliders and the duck fat fries were good. \n\nThe steak was VERY greasy and not good at all you think paying $80 for a steak it would be amazing. But no. I would rather eat a steak at some chain restaurant. \n\nOur bill was $350 for 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides and 2 drinks and tip. Thankfully I had a $50 restaurant.com certificate. \n\nI would never go back and was very disappointed in the execution. Also the waitress was not attentive and she added an automatic 18% since I used the restaurant.com certificate which is tacky."

            "review": "StripSteak is Michael Mina's fourth restaurant in Las Vegas, and his first steak house. Main courses are pretty much what you'd expect of a steak house: lots of steak, and some seafood. Beef lovers may choose between Angus beef, Wagyu beef (what most places call Kobe) and, if memory serves, true Kobe beef. There are some surprises in the side dishes. I failed to write any down except those I ended up ordering: duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones.\n\nThe feel is modern, with lots of glass and steel. An industrial ceiling is high above, below which is a checkerboard latticework of what looks like stainless steel. The floor is speckled black, white, and gray granite tile. In the bar area, the bar top is glass with a stainless steel edge at the back. Servers are dressed in black. Loud rock music is playing.\n\nI opted for a ridiculously unhealthy meal: Angus filet mignon; duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones. The filet was firm, a little dry, but with a nice charcoal flavor. It was served with two small roasted peppers and a bulb of roasted garlic. The duck fat fries were very interesting: three small cups of french fries, with three flavors (BBQ; truffle; unknown) and three sauces (BBQ; mayonnaise; catsup). The fries were crisp, almost crunchy, and tasted great. Highly recommended. The roasted marrow bones were very good, with lots of rich marrow; very good with steak. This is something you either love or hate.\n\nThis isn't the best steak house in town, but it's an interesting addition - more for the side dishes than the steak. Prices are high but not outrageous for food that is good but not stellar. I might come back to see what other side dishes look interesting."

Keep that stuff in the can plz.\n\nI got a roasted beet salad, which I expected to be a little more rustic... but they kind of tasted like canned beets.  And too much of the white cheese! \n\nOrdered the truffled mac and cheese after being convinced by the waiter...\nonly OK, not blown away and couldn't really taste whatever was truffled.  I think they use the word truffle as a license to charge and extra $5. :/\n\nMy dry aged steak was pretty damn good, which I would have been pissed if it wasn't for $60.  \n\nMy dad's waygu tip steak thing was also tender and delicious. \n\nBrothers pork and collards with grits was only ok.

Yes it can be a bit noisy because it is very popular and the layout is very open. The staff has always been very accommodating. The complimentary fry trio you get upon being seated is a nice teaser but they like to tell you they are compliments of the chef. Ha ha nice try. Everyone gets these and has been for years, they are now the equivalent of chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. I will however never refuse them, they are yummy. If you aren't a big steak eater the chicken is amazing and just the right size. If you get a side of the Mac& cheese it's extremely rich and satisfying. The lobster fritters are very pricey but unique and tasty, I get them every time. It's a perfect appetizer that will not fill you up and a great start before a meal."

I have to start off by saying that our waiter was very knowledgeable & attentive. He was able to answer all of our questions & he brought everything to us in a timely manner. His timing was perfect. His name was Steve. But, I'm pretty sure everyone there is nice. It is a fancy place, so, it is a little bit rather expensive. But, definitely worth every penny! Plus, they give you a couple of complementary items. Such as their french fries. There were three different batches & each one had that their own dipping sauce or ketchup. That was a nice touch. In addition to the fries, we ordered our usual shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were fresh & tasted very delicious! The cocktail sauce had a little bit of a kick to it, but it was not too spicy at all. Although, they did have a little tiny bottle of Tabasco for those that really like it spicy. The cucumber Martini was excellent. It was not watered down, but it didn't have too much alcohol either. I know for some, that could never be possible. I also had their hot tea which came in a cute little Asian style teapot. The sugar was in a separate shiny brass container. Very elegant. I ordered the 16 oz. ribeye. I was a little worried because it did not have the bone in. That is what I am used to. But, it was still very flavorful. I also asked for it to be extra well done & extra charred. Some restaurants are scared to do this. So, I always add the sentence \"I promise I will not complain if it's burnt.\" Some like it rare, I like it that way. Different strokes for different folks. It came out perfectly. I was very happy with it. As for the sides, we ordered the broccoli, the gratin potatoes & the truffle mac & cheese. I did not particularly like the truffle mac & cheese. I like truffles, but to a minimum. As for the potatoes, they were absolutely delicious. They do their gratin quite differently from other places. I like their version very much! (I did not personally try the broccoli, although I heard it was good.) We got stuffed rather quickly. The food was filling, comforting & very delicious. For dessert, I wanted to try their famous beignets. I read about them, they sounded & looked amazing in the pictures. Unfortunately, I didn't have anyone to share them with. So, we had some ice cream. Cinnamon toast & mint chocolate chip. I loved the mint chocolate chip, but I didn't care for the cinnamon toast too much. Lastly, when Steve packed up everything to go. We were surprised with another gift. Their absolutely delicious caramel & chocolate popcorn. One for each person. Once again, such a nice touch. Overall, I really love this restaurant. They treat their customers in a special way, kind of like family or close friends. And, we like that. I hope to visit this establishment again. And soon."

            "review": "Michael Mina has exploded.  Before you know it, he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.  I've eating at several of his other restaurants so I had a good idea of what to expect.  However, this was the first time I've visited his steakhouses.  From a culinary aspect, I've always enjoyed his food.  However, the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable number.  I've always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because I feel like it cost a little more than its worth.  The amount of add-ons you get exceed reasonable.  With that being said, having an expensive restaurant in Vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.  So, with that in mind, my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.  \n\nAt a steakhouse, its a standard that I get the bone-in rib eye.  We went to StripSteak on a Thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm, which was great (we arrived at 9:45pm).  I ordered the American Kobe Tartare and it was delicious.  Very flavorful, not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.  An excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.  The steak I ordered was medium-rare and it was spot on.  The thickness of the cut is slightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at Delmonico's.  So the edges of the cut were closer to medium than the center which was closer to medium-rare.  The tenderness of the steak was excellent.  An excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.  \n\nA steakhouse should be able to make great steak.  That is the norm.  To make great appetizers at a steakhouse, that isn't necessarily a given.  I think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and \"other\" parts of the meal I've experienced was at David Burke's Primehouse in Chicago.  At that steakhouse, it is more than just the steak.  StripSteak is pretty close but still a distant second to David Burke's.  The thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a four-star on yelp is the scotch selection.  The selection of scotch is extensive and is well worth the visit for any aficionado.  On this night, I visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.  \n\nLastly, this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true Japanese A5 wagyu.  They have two choices, filet and ribeye.  Both Bradley Ogden's in Caesar's Palace and SW steakhouse in the Wynn have a version of the filet and CUT in the Palazzo actually has two choices as well (filet and ribeye).  So this is one of the few amongst many traditional steakhouses.  It does provide more options.\n\nCons: \nThe wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review (9/13/09-ish).  I was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that I wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection, although expansive, was expensive.  As usual, the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.  \n\nI've only been here once so far but I look forward to eating here again.  Nice work Michael, now maybe you can fix your original namesake in Union Square---but I digress."

Oh, and the duck fat fries were good too. Again, not as great a I thought they would be. The focaccia was way too greasy. service and atmosphere were great, but when those things overshadow the food..not a good thing.

It has to be good right?\"  Boy, were we wrong!  The albacore was icy?  WTF?  The tuna was fishy.  AND.  AND!  The toro was so fibrousy.\n2.

Knowledgable about the menu and answered all our questions in the smallest mini dress you could find. Hey, it's Vegas.\n\nI got the Kobe beef; I can't remember the exact name but it was a mix of different parts of the cow. Amazing and tender and melt in your mouth. The birthday girl got a porterhouse and equally delicious as well.\n\nWasn't planning on getting side dishes since the duck fat fries were filling, but we ended up getting potatoes au gratin and asparagus. The asparagus had something sweet on top that didn't jive with me. But overall they went very well with the steak.\n\nI told them it was my girlfriend's birthday and I was under the impression they would give us a free birthday dessert with 'happy birthday' written in chocolate, but you have to actually order a dessert for that to happen.

We were seated right on time for our reservation at a private table towards the back. They give each table a trio of duck fat fries with three different dipping sauces on the house. It was a nice touch since we didn't order an appetizer. \n\nWe ordered:\n\n30oz Porterhouse: It was a good size and since I'm not much of a meat person, my husband had to take care of the majority of it. The meat was perfectly cooked albeit a bit under-seasoned. \n\nPotato puree trio: Such a cute presentation and a perfect side for spud lovers. The potatoes were pureed to creamy perfection but the flavors weren't very potent. The lobster mash wasn't as decadent  as Mastros, and the sour cream and onion tasted like plain mashed potatoes. The horseradish had a nice kick to it and was my favorite of the bunch.\n\nBrussel sprouts: We read it had bacon lardon mixed in and we were sold. The smoky flavor of the bacon complemented the shredded brussel sprouts nicely. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of Cabernet and it was our first time seeing the sommelier pour a little bit out  to taste for himself before presenting it to us. \n\nThe server was attentive but not intrusive. Good ambiance, not crowded, quiet, dim lighting, typical fancy steakhouse vibe. Although we did enjoy our experience here, with so many great steakhouses in Vegas, it's hard to say when would come back."

            "review": "Compared to other steak houses I've visited in Las Vegas, Stripsteak is middle-of-the-road. If I'm going to spend a lot of money I'd rather dine at Carnevino, Cut, or Delmonico. If I want a decent steak at a more affordable price, I'd go to Twin Creeks.\n\nMy wife and I arrived early -- about half an hour before our reservation. The hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. It was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. Add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.\n\nThe food wasn't bad at all. As a matter of fact, some of it was great. But, I think there's better value to be had elsewhere.\n\nTo start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (Old Bay flavored, Garlic herb, and truffle oil). All were some of the best fries I've had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. They were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. We had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.\n\n//Appetizers//\nSweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. Excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.\n\nMain lobster fritters ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. Three per order. The lobster flavor was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. But the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. Not worth getting again.\n\n//Entree and sides//\n10 oz. filet ($56). They were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. Ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. Tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at Carnevino.\n\nTwo sides of king crab ($24 ea.). Each order contained two meaty crab legs with lemon. Served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.\n\nShallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. Three cakes. Perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you'll ever have.\n\nEnglish peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. Peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren't crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. Oh, and I forgot pricey. But we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.\n\n3.5 Stars"

I've eaten dinner where at least 3 times over the past few years.  \n\nMy last visit was like my previous visits...\n\nThey insisted on a reservation and we arrived 5 minutes early only to wait in the too-crowded-to-even-order-a-drink bar for another 20 minutes.  When we did get seated, the table was too small and had to wait even longer.\n\nI did like the environment though. It was busy but we were able to have a reasonable conversation during dinner.  This is not the place for your quiet, romantic dinner though. \n\nThe waiter (Jason?) was an absolute professional - making recommendations, providing the perfect service at just the right time and was courteous without being a kiss-bu**.   If this was only a service review, 6 stars. But...\n\nThe wedge salad was chopped...so I'm not sure why it's called a wedge salad. Lol. It was dressed just right. The bacon was thick and very tasty. \n\nI ordered the wagyu filet and it was very good. I was surprised how flavorful it was - for as tender as it was. That is wagyu though. \n\nWe ordered and shared the sides. Mac and cheese and spinach were not great. Mushrooms and smashed potatoes were delicious. \n\nFor the prices, my expectations were and are very high. The food was great but the wait for the table and long wait for our food plus the table setting mistake shouldn't happen in a place like this - at these prices. \n\n...wow, I sound like a snob. But, When high prices set my high expectations - then they under-deliver, it's doubly bad."

The entrance is very open, glass windows that extend to the roof and you can see the whole restaurant just standing out side.  \n\nLarge cow carcasses hang from hooks in the fridge behind the glass by the kitchen.  I'm guessing these are the delicious ones that they'll be hacking off for my order.\n\nThe host is formal; he pulls out my chair, hands me a menu, and places a napkin in my lap for me.  Thanks guy.  I order the filet mignon (a la carte, as most of the menu items come), the beau orders the Fried chicken w/mac & cheese.  Meanwhile, compliments of the chef are 3 types of fries and corresponding sauces - Truffle, BBQ, and ketchup, as well as a small pan of potato foccacia.  The truffle fries won me over.  I could have eaten plenty more of those. \n\nHad I known that they were bringin out the fries and bread, I would have skipped ordering a side of asparagus, which had this citrussy glaze over it, bleh.  I didn't want it to be sweet :P  I also prefer my asparagus unpeeled; I think it's crispier that way.\n\nWell, onto the steak; wow! That was easily the most tender, juicy and flavorful steak I've ever experienced. Yes, experienced.  It was that good.  I didn't think i could handle 10 ounces of it, but it was THAT good, tender inside, crusty with steak rub/seasoning on the outside and very lean around the edges, I tried the beau's chicken, too.  Hyum :) Was it juicy!  \n\nAll in all, I was very pleased with our meal and the service.  I'd like to say I would return, but it was quite the expensive meal! Not that it wasn't worth it, but ... well, we're poor."

The hostess and waitress was hard to connect with and was distracted on who knows what! I ordered the simplest one could get 10oz Filet Mignon Medium-Rare+ and it came out cold and raw  in the center. I had to send it back and they ended up burning it The sides were great like Au Gratin but outside of that nothing impressive and wouldn't trust them with a steak again. If Gordon Ramsay ate here he'd rip them a new one and then some!. I eat a lot of steak and this place is overpriced on steaks that don't deliver. I don't mind paying more but this was a complete disappointment on quality of their featured menu item (steak) including a new strip which isn't even featured as the restaurant name suggests.

I had a wardrobe change into looser clothes but still enjoyed a great meal here last Sunday. The trio of fries comes out in place of bread. They took awhile to arrive at our table (note : service isn't the fastest) but they were fantastic. Who doesn't love French fries, especially when fried in duck fat? My favorite dipping sauce was the truffle cream and my favorite fries were the garlic herb. Delicious!\n\nI ordered the scallops and added the roasted bone marrow because I just had to. I should've just had that bone marrow as my main course. It's so fatty and meaty and drool inducing with the buttery little toast on the side. You better believe I scraped that bone marrow clean. The scallops were fine but for $41 I don't think the 3 pieces were worth it. We had lobster mac and cheese as a side and they were ok but I don't recall seeing or tasting any lobster. Maybe the essence of the lobster was running throughout the cheese sauce and my unrefined palate did not catch it.\n\nMy husband ordered the foie gras tasting menu. I was too busy eating my own meal but I remember not liking the cold appetizer. The salad course was awesome and I got a big piece of the foie gras from his place. I guess they banned it in California recently so we had foie gras on the mind. I wouldn't order this again if I had a choice however, but I'm not the hugest fan of the stuff.\n\nAll in all, a great (and overpriced, but hey it's Vegas) meal."

            "review": "DO NOT WANT\n\nI can get an idea for what this place emphasizes and it's not service.\n\nLet me list our problems with our visit to this establishment:\n\n1) Eternal waiting: our server took his time to make it to our table. The staff took their time delivering bread and drinks to us. \n\nOnce we ordered, it was at least 45 minutes, possibly longer, before our entrees were delivered to us. We discovered somehow that the kitchen chose to first serve a large group that arrived later than we did. No apologies, no visits from the manager, no \"make ups.\"\n\n2) Dishonesty: While waiting outside we had noticed the prix-fixe menu stated the rib eye was a 12-oz, while the rib eye a-la carte was 18-oz. That was reasonable for the price (which was roughly comparable); some in our party chose the a-la carte and others chose prix-fixe.\n\nWhen the entrees finally came, to our surprise there were no differences in the size of our steaks. When we inquired of the waiter he stated that the steaks were the same size regardless of prix-fixe or a-la carte. When we then pointed out that if we had known, all of us would have ordered the prix-fixe, he did not respond.\n\n3) Food: the best part of the meal, honestly, was the fries. The spinach souffle is nasty. And having been to Mastro's, Ruths Chris, Lawry's, and Flemings, the steak is overpriced for its quality. \n\nEasy to say we aren't coming back and I hope this review drives foot traffic elsewhere."

The place was empty and our server was extremely friendly and attentive.  We had a $25 gift cert thanks to Restaurant.com, but I think every dollar spent is well worth it!\n\nI ordered the  18oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye ($52) cooked 'medium' and my boyfriend ordered the 16oz Kansas City strip ($46) cooked 'medium rare'.  Both steaks were prepared superbly.  The rib eye was juicy and tender with each bite.  The strip was just as juicy and much more tender to the bite.  They were both well seasoned and we savored each bite.\n\nFor sides, we ordered the scalloped potatoes ($12) and truffle mac & cheese ($12).  The scalloped potatoes just slightly more than ordinary... it was the chipotle that gave it an extra oomph and why I enjoyed it.  But the mac & cheese.... o.m.g.... I'm biased... b'coz I.LOVE.MAC.AND.CHEESE.  So, you might want to rule my opinion out.  The truffle mac & cheese was perfectly creamy and cheesy and truffley... pure decadence.\n\nWe were also given a complimentary platter of 3 types of french fries with 3 dipping sauces.  The fries prepared in duck fat were my fav... along with the garlic aoli sauce!!\n\nOverall.... great service, great food, and great experience.  I will be returning again."

The servers paid attention to detail, had the right amount of \"chat\" in them, and didn't give off any stuffy vibes for a place that is priced at that level. \n\nThe atmosphere is underrated. I thought that the open feel was nice; instead of going with the \"modern\" color tones, the wood feel of the side wall (a giant Jenga piece) kept the balance between old-world and new-world. The chairs were VERY comfortable to sit on (and I'm a big guy). This is an important detail after being stuffed.\n\nThe food was a notch below \"the best.\" This is not a slight on this restaurant. I just happen to reserve my \"Best\" label for only the 2-3 elite few restaurants. The meat was a little overseasoned for my taste buds (as was my wife's). The sides were delicious. Our favorite was the Jalapeno Creamed Corn - yum! The Truffled Mac and Cheese was really good too. The trio of mashed potatoes is a safe choice if you are looking to go that route. Our appetizer, the Hamachi, was decent. The flavor profile of the fish and the seasoning (fresh) was good - however, it just didn't fit with our steak and potatoes type of meal.\n\nI would come here again. I have a feeling the steak was overseasoned on accident (not so much so that I would have to send it back - I still ate all of it). The deal at restaurant.com really made this a great luxury-value."

Well my buddy and I decided to try Stripsteak since we didn't have the requisite number of peeps to eat the tasting menu at Craftsteak. Also it was good to try a different steak place in LV.\n\nWell it's a very happenin' place. Crowded with lovely looking hostesses in short black dresses. Always a plus in my book :D Plus they had complimentary duck fat fries tonight with the trio of dipping sauces. Excellent start so far. The crab cake and romaine heart appetizers were ordered. Crab cake was decent. Nothing spectacular. The romaine heart was a bit too salty because of the overwhelming anchovies and cheese on it. Could have passed on that. As far as what we ate, my buddy had the special which was a 12oz American Kobe New York Steak while I had the 8oz American Kobe Ribeye Cap. The Ribeye Cap had more marbling that the New York Steak so there was definitely a more buttery feel when you chewed it while the New York Steak was meatier and lacked some of the fat. Both were exceptionally seasoned and grilled. Just remember to request light on the salt just in case it becomes oversalted. Dessert was the mini doughnuts which were crispy on the outside and slightly cakey on the inside. Dusted with powdered sugar, you had chocolate and caramel sauces to dip and a large scoop of caramel ice cream as an accompaniment. \n\nThe server was great and was always there to make sure everything was fine. The secondary server was quick to set up and remove our plates once we were done. Once again, water was promptly filled which is a plus. Also, the server confirmed what I heard about them slowly butter poaching their steaks until it gets to room temp and then placing it on the grill to cook further. Gotta love the butter."

Rosemary and onion fries with an onion ketchup dip\n\nI love french fries and these were cooked right. Fresh potatoes were cut and fried to perfection. The exterior was crispy and the inside was soft with a richer taste coz of the duck fat.\n\nOur table didn't get the 2nd complimentary dish, the olive oil focaccia. I should have asked, but I wanted to save room for steak.\n\nSTRIP-PEAR ($13) - 4 stars\nI chose the Strip-Pear martini. It's made with Grey Goose La Poire (Anjou pear flavored vodka), lychee puree (instead of the usual pear puree) and fresh lime juice. Pear was the main flavor with a hint of lychee. It was sweet and medium strong... nice.\n\nOther drinks we got were: Guinness ($8), Stella Artois ($8), New Castle ($7) and Lustau Solera ($13).\n\n18oz DRY-AGED BONE-IN RIB EYE ($51) - 4 stars\n10oz FILET MIGNON ($54) - 4.5 stars\nAll of our steaks came out medium/high warm. Note, after grilling steaks need to rest for the juices redistribute. Both steaks were super tasty and tender with a smokey and peppery finish. All 4 (1 rib eye and 3 filets) steaks were cooked perfectly as requested. \n\nThe plate presentation is simple: steak, a whole roasted shallot and yellow pepper and garnished with a small sprig of thyme. No fluffy presentation for the main dish. There's room on the plate to place your sides.  It's a steakhouse after all.\n\nI asked out server how the steaks are cooked and she said, \"They're poached then grilled and basted with a wine butter.\" I did some research to get the details of how they cook their steaks.\n\nStep 1: Steaks are placed in slow-poaching chambers, which enhances flavor and tenderness. The meat heats for several hours at a low temperature. \n\nStep 2: Steaks are then grilled on a cast iron grill above mesquite wood. The wood gives every cut of steak a nice subtle smokiness.\n\nPOTATO PUREE TRIO ($14)  - 4 stars\nAnother trio dish we ordered. The 3 flavors were: horseradish, lobster and sour cream. The puree was seasoned nicely. All of the purees were smooth, rich and creamy. \n\nBACON-CREAMED SPINACH ($10) - 4 stars\nThe crowd fav was the creamed spinach. It was made with spinach, heavy cream, shallot, garlic, butter, nutmeg, S&P and topped with bacon crumbs.\n\nPASSION FRUIT PANNA COTTA ($12) - 4 stars\nPassion fruit pieces, red grape fruit, thin slices of avocado, and coconut sorbet sit atop the panna cotta. The panna cotta itselft was refreshing, light and subtle sweet. The avocado gave the dessert extra creaminess and weight. While the grapefruit and coconut sorbet gave it a tart and sweet pairing.\n\nMILK CHOCOLATE CUSTARD ($12) - 3.5 stars\nSmall red velvet cake pieces, powder sugar, toasted pecans, cocoa nib ice cream lay on top of the chocolate custard. This dessert was smooth and rich like a very thick pudding. The topping provided a nice contrast.\n\nI was so full by the end of dinner. Anyhow, the steak dinner was a nice way to close out our weekend of Vegas fun. Cost for a party of 4 with tax was $335 (alcohol $49, steaks $213, sides $24 and dessert $24). \n\nReduce costs by 1) get alkie during happy hour 4-7pm at the bar, 2) non-big eaters share a steak or 3) order the prix fixe menu 3-courses for $55. Prix fixe only offers chicken or prime rib. \n\nOverall, my experience was good. It's better than all of the chain steakhouses: Fleming's, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT Steak, etc. Next steakhouses, I'd like to try is Mastro's and CUT."

When we sat down, they give you a complimentary trio of duck fat fries with 3 different dipping sauces...ok these were DELISH...probably the best french fries I've ever eaten.  Then I chose to get the salad---which was fresh and good---my bf got the crab soup....very good (the crab taste is very subtle and not overwhelming).  Then the steaks came out...it was cooked to perfection and seasoned to perfection.  The steaks were pretty large compared to other steakhouses I've been to----Ruth Chris, Flemings, Mortons, Houstons.  The sides come in small dishes (we got the truffle mac and cheese and broccoli)...delish!  The sides are very small...but very good.  The service was slow...but hey, we were in Vegas....not in a huge rush to get anywhere.  The decor is nice and modern and sleek.  Stainless steel everything.  This place is expensive-----so I recommend going to Restaurants.com and getting the coupon first."

The spicy zucchini with garlic and olive oil is a tad mushy but has good flavor.  The Maine lobster fritters are seriously tasty and consist of fried tube-shaped pieces which you place inside shiso leaf wraps, squeeze lime juice on and apply lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche.  \n\nWe are served complimentary french fries with various dipping sauces (Cajun, truffle and Rosemary).  The twelve ounce skirt steak has excellent char and flavor while the dry-aged medium-rare eighteen ounce bone-in rib eye is juicy, has great char and excellent smoke factor.  This is an outstanding steakhouse whose quality rivals Mastro's of Newport Beach."

I don't think I've had a more tender stake in my life. As for as the sides the brussels sprouts with bacon were my fav, then the truffle Mac yum. Even the caesar salad was delicious.

Actually everything was pretty good except the steak.  Unfortunately, it's a steakhouse!  All the medium steaks were raw.  I don't mind rare, but I can't do raw.  I sent mine back for some more time on the grill, but my wife lost her appetite after a few bites of raw meat.  A fancy steakhouse should be able to get this right in its sleep.  The bill was $700 (with very few drinks).  I wouldn't go back.  This type of business doesn't have to rely on repeat business.  Every week a new crop of guests arrive, reads the great reviews and is willing to give it a try.  I hope my loss is someone else's gain.  Take your hard earned money somewhere else."

It would basically be borderline pornographic...\n\nThe three words you need to hear at the beginning of your dinner that ensures a very pleasurable experience... DUCK FAT FRIES (and a trio no less).  What an amazing thing!  Light, crispy, wonderful flavor.  I was expecting something that would be too rich to handle, but these were great.  Three flavors (bbq, truffle, herbed) with accompanying dipping sauces.  Yum.\n\nI decided to forego an appetizer as I really wanted to sink my teeth into some steak.  So tempted to go for Wagyu beef, but I went for an 18oz dry-aged Angus rib-eye... perfectly seasoned and cooked.  No need for any kind of sauce.  And the sides...\n\nThe sides!  Truffled mac n' cheese.... and not just mac n' cheese made with truffle oil, but actual truffle shavings in the sauce!  Heaven.  Creamed spinach with bacon... caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes... and their complimentary foccacia bread.   \n\nFor dessert... Beignets with 18-year-old Scotch pudding... just the right amount of booziness.  The beignets were warm, light, and airy. \n\nAs if this isn't enough fried dough... i also ordered the Dunkin' mini doughnuts... these came with jasmine infused chocolate sauce and salted caramel sauce... yes...  yes...\n\nService was wonderful... The space is beautiful and modern.  \n\nThis is my second visit to a Michael Mina restaurant... he hasn't disappointed.   Can't wait to go to his other restaurants!"

In the end, what really annoyed me was the waiter.  I sort of knew what to order already but wanted confirmation from him.  I went about every item with an inquisitive stance and he kept saying \"amazing,\" \"the best,\" \"great choice,\" etc.  I guess that is his job to not only hype up but also support his employer.  Personally speaking, I would be embarrassed if I were him because almost every dish was terrible and that is not an exaggeration.  The guy disappeared on us for long stretches.  He wasn't attentive and his smug attitude just got to me.  The best item was probably the duck fat fries, which happened to be free, thanks.  Here was the order:\n\nAppetizers:\n- Oysters - weren't terrible but I have had way better\n- Hamachi Sashimi - the WORST I have EVER had; it was pure MUSH without any texture;  it literally melted and broke apart in your mouth but in the opposite way you would expect if you had good or even decent sashimi before\n\nEntrees:\n- Wagyu Filet - GF ordered medium, and it came out almost rare; maybe it was an honest mistake but other steakhouses would have replaced the entire steak and not have recooked it, which took about 15 minutes\n- Wagyu Rib Cap - I really don't think this was wagyu.  It tasted like a normal steak.  With every successive bite, I was waiting for that strong hit and it never came\n\nSides (smallest sides I have ever received at a steakhouse; are they trying to be cute?):\n- Spinach Souffle - presentation was cool but tasted so plain\n- Mac and Cheese - truffle was nonexistent;  COME ON, you couldn't make the portion size bigger for MAC AND CHEESE?  It came out in a little teacup, truly pathetic.\n\nDessert:\n- not even worth mentioning\n\nThe experience was poor.  The ambiance was extremely plain.  Contemporary maybe - but nothing popped out.  I felt like I was just eating in a room.  For a $240 bill, excluding tip and without alcohol, I was disappointed to say the least.  I was disappointed that I went out of my way from Encore to Mandalay Bay to eat this overpriced, tasteless, and possibly unauthentic food.  Maybe there is a trend happening for Michael Mina's restaurants.  They start off good and then slowly dissipate.  The same thing happened to one of his restaurants on the Sunset strip.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was the next victim.  I kept saying to myself \"the next one has got to be better.\"  Hope is not a strategy, sorry.  For what I was expecting and what I received, I could be generous and have given 2 stars.  Then again, I would be dishonest with myself.  Do yourself a favor - save your money and time and go somewhere else."

Dinner at StripSteak was fantastic and I'm still thinking about it, several days later!\n\nWe ordered west coast oysters and crab cakes for our appetizers.  The oysters were super fresh, but I could have done without the crab cakes.  Don't get me wrong, the cakes were good: made with whole lump crab and contained no fillers, but it just wasn't anything to write home about.  \n\nI shared a 30 oz. porterhouse Angus steak with my sister.  We ordered it medium rare and it gloriously arrived at our table to perfection!  They even sliced it for us, knowing that we were planning to share!  It literally melted in your mouth.  No joke.\n\nWe ordered 3 side dishes and shared them family style -- Spinach Souffle with Parmesan Cream Sauce, Truffled Mac and Cheese, and Blue Cheese crusted Potatoes Au Gratin.  And I have to say, all of them exceeded my expectations.  The Souffle was delicate but flavorful, the Mac and Cheese deserves an entire review to itself (I was worried it was going to be too heavy and the noodles mushy and overcooked, but alas, I was wrong!), and the Au Gratin was the right balance of creamy and salty goodness.\n\nAs if everything we've had at this point wasn't enough, we ordered beignets with creme brulee and passion fruit panna cotta with coconut and mandarin sorbet.  Somebody punch me.  Although the creme brulee was tiny, the beignets were warm and comforting.  The panna cotta was creamy, delicious and refreshing.\n\nJust from everything I've ever heard about Michael Mina restaurants, I was expecting high brow, snooty service, but instead, we had the most attentive server who was pleasant, downright kind and totally normal.  I could tell that he shared a love for the food and was happy to explain and answer all of our questions!  \n\nThis restaurant really hit all of the buttons for me: great food, fantastic service and impeccable attention to detail.  Even the music that was playing in the restaurant was pleasantly unexpected.   Tables are not that close to each other and the booths give you a sense of privacy.  Yeah, it's pricey, but worth every penny."

I'm not saying it was their fault, and I'm not saying it wasn't.  My wife finished her over salted steak while I was in the restroom being sick and the waiter and manager firmly told her that she had to pay the bill in full and they couldn't comp anything.  She never even asked for it, she just said I wasn't feeling well and probably wouldn't be eating my over salted undercooked steak (medium rare is a cool pink center, not raw and uncooked).  I'm not giving a bad review because I got sick or because they put a pound of salt on the steaks.  I'm giving them a bad review on how rude they were and made a big point to let everyone know that my sickness couldn't possibly be their fault.  I will definitely not be back."

You won't leave with the feeling that you would need to get some fastfood right after dinner. \n\nThe duck fat fries was like the free appetizer thing. It was awesome. Don't even need to dip it in ketchup/ranch or anything. We were hoping to get refills on those.\n\nThe waiter recommended Wagyu beef rib cap (apparently it's more marbleized  than the rib eye or something, I wasn't really paying attention to him hehe). Anyway, I got the steak medium, but it looked/tasted like medium-rare. I like the \"crust\" thing on the beef. Don't even need to add any sauce or anything else to it. Definitely worth the $70 I paid for it.\n\nLove the truffled mac and cheese. Truffle oil just seems to make everything tastes better. I wish I could just have the truffled mac and cheese to myself but I had to share it with my friend :(\n\nMy recommendations:\n- Duck fat fries\n- Truffled mac and cheese"

With the choices and intense competition in Las Vegas, a restaurant with a popular name such as this has to really perform. \n\nI really enjoy eating at StripSteak - the steak is nothing dramatically memorable, but it's always good. The menu in general is a typical high-quality steakhouse and fitting to the tasteful d\u00e9cor that lets you remember where it is you are dining.\n\nThe true star though of this restaurant, in my opinion, is the complimentary trio of duck fat fries. This is genuinely what I look forward to most here. They are to die for and THESE do make the meal memorable.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and want a good steak dinner without really breaking the bank, StripSteak is a very solid choice - you won't be disappointed."

I've always noticed that if i am on the fence about a meal being good or not, it comes down to the value for me... \"was it worth it?\"\n\nI came to StripSteak for a business function and a group of approximately 20 different people. The dining space is slightly upscale, with a welcoming atmosphere, nice lighting, and not ridiculously loud music. Service was tentative and friendly was worked our group well without hiccups. The food was from a fixed menu like usual with larger groups, choosing a starter, and your entree from 2-3 choices. I had a prawn starter that came with 3 large prawns and a sauce on the plate (i don't see this on regular menu). Fresh, good, and perfect starter for a much heavier beef entree to come very soon. My steak choices were of the 16 oz. Rib eye or 10 oz. Filet and i opted for the filet as i wasn't overly hungry and the smaller cut would be perfect. The meat was pleasantly prepared consistent throughout the table and was of quality you would expect at a place like StripSteak. Sides that were offered were Broccolini and Mashed Potatoes, the Broccolini was quite tasty and i didnt try the Potatoes but im sure they were good as well given the feedback at the table. All in all it was a good meal, actually the best i had over the 4 day event being in town and having a meal each night at a new place. You would expect that when you come to a place such as StripSteak, with the pricing that your meal should always be a thumbs up but its not the case. The same time last year a similar group went to Carnevino, and the quality of the food was not up to par as i am guessing it has to do with maybe the large group and fixed menu. So if your looking for a quality spot that will handle your corporate event, with good food, solid service, and a positive impression StripSteak ranks up there for me."

            "review": "Strip steak is probably the most unique of the steak houses in Vegas. The focus is on the meat itself with very little outside influences. What that means is that the steak speaks for itself.\n\nThe ambiance is quite nice but since the bar is pretty big and at the entrance, the place is pretty loud too. The staff was very good in that they checked up on me often even when I didn't even order anything yet. They are the only ones that offered me a Prix Fix menu.\n\nThe first thing that comes out is probably one of the most addicting fries you will ever put in your mouth, their Duck Fat Fries. I know it doesn't sound as good but the crunch and flavor will change your mind. Knowing that is complimentary makes it harder to resist. It comes with 3 flavors: Original, Herb fries, and Old Bay fries (the latter being the saltiest and least favorite of the bunch for me). There are 3 dipping sauces, Truffle Aioli, Ketchup, and Mustard Remoulade (not sure how to spell that).\n\nThe appetizer was a single crab cake (normally $18). Although it seemed fresh and tasted very good, it was not worth the price in my opinion. Thank god for the Prix Fix menu. The one thing I will say is that as soon as it comes out, the fresh crab aroma does hit you pretty hard, which is good for seafood lovers.\n\nThe truffle Mac N' Cheese was very good. Not too cheesy, not too salty. The flavor is smokey so I wonder if they used some sort of smoked cheese like Smoked Gouda. Cream is smooth and not overpowering.\n\nThe Brussel Sprouts were undecipherable. It was a mish-mash of a whole bunch of stuff I could not discern. It reminded me of that Cafeteria mystery meat where you are unsure what is in it. Probably my least favorite side of all the steak houses I've been too so far.\n\nThe STEAK: The steak is first poached at 118-119 degrees in butter for 20-30 minutes, depending on size of cut. It is them placed on a grill raised by a giant wheel (as seen in pictures) over mesquite wood and charcoal. The seafood side of the grill has an additional wood (Olive Wood). Surprisingly, there is no char or crunch on the steak but because the steak was poached, the cooking is uniform throughout the steak. This is where Strip Steak focuses on the Steak. No other sauces are added.\n\nThe root beer float dessert brought back childhood memories. Nothing spectacular but great nostalgia."

I had a gift certificate from restaurant.com, so that helped on the bill a bit. \n\nFor Christmas night, it was surprisingly busy.  There was no special menu offered.  I will say, the set up in the restaurant is a little crowded. We couldn't help hearing the couple seated next to us bicker drunkenly, and were amused (and horrified) when the woman picked up her steak bone and proceeded to gnaw on it.  The music playing in the background was also a bit strange.  At first, we thought it was coming from elsewhere, but no, it was within the restaurant.  A mixture of club/pop/hip hop, which I didn't mind, but thought it odd for an upscale restaurant.  It wasn't playing loudly, however.\n\nAs always, the duck fat fries were delicious. I could eat them all day! The sauces were a nice compliment as well.  I ordered the scallops and a lobster tail, and we ordered the truffle mac and cheese as a side.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and a nice size (4 of them), and the lobster tail was tasty as well.  I found the sauce to be a bit oily, however.  The mac & cheese was also very good, but it too seemed a bit oily.  \n\nService was pretty good, leisurely pace, but they did forget to refill my iced tea, even after I requested another.  Small glitch, but I did notice."

The sashimi was fresh and had some jalape\u00f1os for a little kick, and the bacon deal was just flat perfect.\n\nI had the Angus filet medium rare which was cooked to perfection, tender, well marbled...basically they took a perfect filet and made it better. \n\nBacktracking to the beginning of the experience at the bar, one of the bartenders told us that someone at our table had to get the rib cap. My brother in law ordered it and I was more than impressed. I'd never even heard of the cut and I'd like to think I'm pretty well versed in the beef world.\n\nOur sides were potatoes gratin and the mushrooms. Both sides were an 11/10. We also had dessert, one couple split the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and my wife and I split the apple cinnamon. I'm still dreaming about that. \n\nThe portions were perfectly sized, leaving I was satisfied but didn't feel like I needed to be hauled out of there in a forklift.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly, helpful, attentive, and had good recommendations.

It was just like how it was in the scene from \"I Love You Man\" where Peter just proposed to his fiance and she is sooo excited that she calls all of her friends to spread the good news of their engagement.  Only, my similar experience occurred when I took my first bite of their complimentary seasoned fries with their special sauces did I realize that it was the beginning of a good thing.  I was impressed that they have manged to perfect french fries with garlic seasoning, bbq seasoning, and regular fries with a crispy outside and a soft center. \n\nBut, it wasn't the fries that had me calling and texting all of my friends and family.  It was when I took the first bite of their special Bone-in 14 oz Filet Mignon that was the taste of perfection.  It was this moment that I realized every filet mignon that I've ever had was a lie because they never gave me the sensation of knowing that I might have just taken a bite out of the best tasting steak.... EVER!!  Our waitress, Rachel, informed us that it was rare for them to have bone-in filet mignon as their specials.  She recommended it over their American Wagyu and 30oz Porterhouse!!!  \n\nGranted that I have never paid $57 for a piece of meat a la carte, but I daresay that it was worth every penny of it!! mMmMm, it was soooo good!!  I can't even describe into words how amazing this steak was, and I am a steak-lover!!  Every new bite of this steak was a surprise because I couldn't believe how amazing it was, and it was a constant reminder of the flavorful amazing taste with each and every bite until the last piece.  \n\nI was a bit disheartened when my steak was near completion, since that meant that I didn't have anymore left... despite how full I was.  Its like reading a really good book and not wanting to reach the last pages because one knew that it would over after those pages.  You didn't want to reach the end of the book since it was soo good, one just wants to keep reading it.... just like how I wanted to keep eating.  It was THAT good!!!  Five stars all the way!!!  \n\nThe BF had their prix-fix $45 clam chowder, prime ribs with three sides, and their amazing chocolate beignets!!  The chocolate beignets  (French Donuts) were amazing, but still did not compare to my steak!!   I will definitely need to start saving money just so that I can eat here every time that I am in Vegas!!  I gotta start a Steak Fund!!  Hence the reason that I was calling and texting everyone about the amazingness of this steak, I hope they can submit their donations to me soon. =wink="

The restaurant unfortunately was Stripsteak. The restaurant itself is nice and seated us immediately upon arrival. The server was quick and responsive. The problems began whenwe ordered. There were a number of items including baked potatoes that were not available this evening. This had to be a major faux pas on the part of the order department but totally affected our view of the place. They must have used up all their potatoes making French fries because that was what they bring in lieu of bread. Their special this evening was prime rib encrusted with a horseradish mix. This my wife ordered the special and it was way below par perhaps being the worst prime rib she has ever had. Nothing to do with the mix, the food was bland and hard to eat. The steak I had was good though. We had Brussels sprouts, which were sliced and blended with bacon, which was tasty. The potato scarcity coupled with the tasteless prime rib assured that we would not be back to this restaurant. A steakhouse with out baked potatoes is just not right. I say dressy in how one should show up but that usually does not happen anymore. Some of our fellow diners were dressed up while others were in sandals and shorts. The short of it is this is a restaurant in a resort and really does not have to live up to any expectations. The management definitely is aware of this fact. Sad because we had higher expectations going in."

This was easily the best steakhouse we have ever eaten at! This place gives you a truly American vibe as soon as you walk through the door. From the dimmed lighting to the wooden table/chairs to the paper place mat, this was definitely American. Don't get me wrong though, this place is still very fancy. Not to mention all the freebies they give out! First freebie was the Duck Fat Fries which were... indescribably delicious. Don't take all the other review for granted, they are all completely accurate!  Second freebie, was the pizza bread. I wasn't really a fan of this, it was just way too dense and dry for my liking, and not to mention filling. I wanted to save my stomach for the STEAK. The third freebie we got was from our waiter Steve, at the end of the meal he gave us two packs of caramel/chocolate covered popcorn to enjoy during our Mystere show we were going to after dinner, very nice gesture, and we of course tipped him accordingly. =)\n\nWith all the freebies we got we decided to go ahead and skip the appetizers and go straight for wine. I ordered a Red Syrah Wine from Sonoma (I think) and she ordered a Pinot Noir (location unknown), I thought both were good, but we ended up switching because she felt that the Pinot was tasteless and I thought it was light and amazing.\n\nMeat:\nWe were actually intending to get the Japanese Wagyu but according to Steve they won't be carrying it for another few months due to a MAD COW breakout in Japan. BOO MAD COW! Regardless, the American Wagyu did not disappoint. I suckered her into getting the American Kobe Rib Eye and I got the Rib Cap. FYI: the Rib Cap is 10 TIMES better than the Rib Eye. The steaks were perfectly cooked to our specifications, Medium Rare. Both pieces of meat were delicious but the marbling of the fat in between the crevices of meat in the Rib Cap made it that much more easier to melt in your mouth than the Rib Eye. But please don't take it the wrong way, the Rib eye was still one of the best Rib Eyes I have ever had. \n\nSides:\nWe ended up getting two sides and sharing, which was more than enough. We got the truffled mac and cheese and the jalapeno creamed corn. We already made our decision that we were getting the truffled mac because of all the reviews. One word described this dish... BOLD. The flavor was bold and I liked it but I could only have so much. The jalapeno creamed corn on the other hand I could have probably ate the whole bowl. It was a perfect combination of creaminess with a hint of spice to give it a kick. It was very very very good.\n\nDessert:\nWe got the Beignets with creme brulee. The beignets came out warm with dusted powder sugar on top. And the creme brulee was well... creme brulee, nothing too special. It was a delicious end to our meal nonetheless.\n\nThis is a definite must eat at spot in Vegas. We were torn between Cut and StripSteak and I think we made the right decision. Next time we are getting the Japanese Wagyu!!"

My Caesar Salad ranked in the bottom third of recent salads for me. We had a wagyu tenderloin and an angus ribeye. Both solid, but hardly worth $150 between them.  The ribeye was tasty, but not appreciably different from what I cook at home when I cook a prime cut. We tried the Broccolini, which was more stalks than tops. Mistake. The wine list is very pricey, and we had a bottle of Inglenook Cask Cabernet 2012. In stores, $60. Here, $180. \n\nOverall the bang for the buck does not justify a higher rating. You might say we walked away with a bad taste in our mouth."

This was, hands down, the best steak house experience I've ever had.\n\nThe atmosphere of this restaurant is completely different than what I'm used to.  It caters towards a younger and trendier crowd (it is Las Vegas after all), which is something not often seen in Chicago.  With that being said, the quality of the food did not suffer one bit.\n\nI forget what everyone else had that day, but I ordered the 18 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked to perfection at medium rare.\n\nAnd surprisingly, the part of the meal that stood out the most was the truffled mac and cheese.\n\nI know what your thinking, how good could mac and cheese possibly be?  That's what I was thinking too.  I was actually leaning towards something more expensive as my side dish, but the waiter kept insisting I get the (cheaper) mac and cheese.  Wise choice.\n\nKudos all around to the chefs and the outstanding service.  I will definitely make this a regular stop every time I come to Las Vegas."

We ended up dining at STRIPSTEAK and Bouchon for our main dinners, and STRIPSTEAK took a notable second place for me out of those two experiences. The food is delicious and the service is great -- there's not a question there. I had the tuna and it was cooked to perfection. My fianc\u00e9 had the bone-in ribeye and seemed to be in heaven. We split the bleu cheese scalloped potatoes as a side and started with the hamachi poppers, both of which were exceptional. Aside from that, we each had a couple of cocktails and noshed on their complimentary trio of fries (the truffle fries and aioli -- nom!). Still, we somehow managed to tally up quite the bill, which is where my uncertainty lies. Around $230 for the two of us. Again, no wine. Just a couple of cocktails each (sub-$15). We did have a restaurant.com gift certificate which helped, but we were still both a little surprised by the cost of the meal. It was good, but not so memorable where it was worth that investment (at least not in my book). \n\nThe ambiance wasn't totally what I expected either. I was expecting something a bit more Bouchon-esque (a little more closed off, dark wood, etc.), but instead the space was pretty modern and open. It's a place that you could go on a date just as easily as you could make it a guys night out. Not overly intimate in its surroundings, though still very nice.\n\nAll in all, I thought it was a very good meal. Not exceptional, and -- for me -- not worth the cost when there are so many other exceptional restaurants offering something bit more unique and equally delicious for the same price point. Still, I'm happy that I've checked a Michael Mina restaurant off the list. I just think I'd have been happier giving that money to Bobby Flay at Mesa Grill. :)"

Everything was top notch- the duck fat fries served as an appetizer in lieu of bread, to the lobster fritters. I had a cucumber martini- very refreshing and not even close to the gag inducing similarly named drink I have ordered at the Gallery Bar at the Biltmore in Downtown LA . The bone in rib-eye was worth every penny. If I had any complaints it would be that I wasn't wowed by the horseradish/lobster/sour cream potato trio- but that was really more of a personal preference than anything.

Tried the American Wagyu vs Australian Wagyu entree which featured two creative and perfectly seasoned preparations. Deconstructed Caesar salad was standard, but solid and good sized.

Maybe I don't have a sophisticated pallet, or maybe I didn't look like I would give up the tip to be seated in a location other than the bar when we were told there was a 45 minute wait for a table. Since we asked the Concierge for a recommendation and reservation information, we definitely would have had them make us reservations instead of the option of the 45 minute wait. We were in view of a group of tables that weren't occupied the entire time we were there and later realized that the restaurant was larger then we were aware of and there were numerous tables Unoccupied we wondered why we weren't seated at a table in the restaurant. We had just missed the happy hour apparently so the rush to get those prices shouldn't have been a problem. It was a Sunday evening last NFL playoff, CES and the Adult Film Awards were over. The hostesses didn't really bother to stop their personal conversation when we approached so it set the tone of what I felt was going to be a negative experience. Because we were seated in the worst seats in the open bar area, I had a first hand view of the open tables that no one was using the entire 1.5 to 2 hours we were at the restaurant. I also had the honor of facing the hostesses that apparently were employed to have conversations with each other until the big boss came along. But that is enough about them.\nThe waitress was attentive gave suggestions and checked in often as well as other staff of the restaurant. Now the restaurant is not some place you would bring your family because it is quite pricey. Since I was being treated I didn't feel that I should order steak from the steak house. Everything is alacart, so expect to spend upward of $100 per person. My companion is a foodie. Likes new and different things. She ordered the pork belly and potatoes scalloped. I ordered beet salad and lobster taco. Now this was supposed to be a fine dining experience (pinky raised), but I have to say not accommodating for menu item adjustments. I asked for pecans with my beet salad. I may have gotten two lonely perfectly positioned pecans. I also realized why there was a pause when I requested additional dressing options. Well my appetizer selection was not a substitute for a meal. The lobster taco had more pico than lobster. I could count the meniscal pieces of lobster. It needed salt and something acidic.  Just a precautionary measure of advice. Do not go here if you are hungry portions are small, small, small. My daughter loved her pork belly. It was deceiving lite, crispy and not as greasy as I expected. The potatoes were alright. The best part of the meal were the French fries that we tried to guess what the seasonings were as well as the sauces. I agree that the catsup was my least favorite. So to the hostesses I say don't judge a customer by its cover. You did pass up a good tip by not seating us. Over all the rating is for OK food, served well but judgmental hostesses."

Both steaks were prepared perfectly.  The rib cap was the more flavorful of the two steaks but was a bit tougher than the filet.  I thought the filet was definitely better than the rib cap.  For side dishes, we had the truffled mac & cheese and the spinach souffle.  Both were also excellent.  Can't wait to go back!"

I was here with a couple of buddies and we were all hopeful for a spectacular meal. \nMind you the food wasn't horrible, but the experience of a steak house was completely null and void. If I wanted food court atmosphere and noise, I would have opted for the McDonald's McRib and saved myself $130.  \nAdditionally, when I sit down at a famous chefs restaurant, make sure I don't have the capability to make better side dishes or steaks (from what I gather none of the guys who had steak enjoyed it) at home. And for the prices that are charged, offering me a 'french fry' sampler 'compliments of the house' was pretty tacky...don't give ketchup a fancy name in the hopes I'd never had ketchup before and didn't know what it tasted like. \nOh, and pay no attention to the dress code because the staff doesn't. You could easily wear a basketball jersey at the bar and if you show up at just the right time, they let you wear basketball shorts and t-shirts to dine there. Really fancied up the place....\nAt least the waiter was nice...I guess it makes a up for everything else, right? no."

I can say I found that here. \n\nI came here with a group for dinner without reservations. They were booked solid but thought they may have a cancellation so called the party to see if they could release the table for us. This level of service continued all night. \n\nAfter being stayed we were brought our drinks with plenty of recommendations from our waitress. This was soon followed by complimentary French fries, fried in duck fat. On top of that they were seasoned with old Bay, black truffle or an herb blend. Best fries ever. \n\nI next had a BLT lettuce wedge. It came with thick cut bacon and large chunks of blue cheese. It was good but at the end of the day it was a chunk of lettuce for $18. \n\nThe real star was the steak, as it should be. I got the house specialty, the Wagyu Rib Cap cooked to a chef recommended and perfect medium rare. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The flavor was off the charts and the Fois gras butter just took the whole thing to another level. I can't remember ever having a better steak. It was really pricy, $89, but worth the cost for sure. \n\nStripsteak  is a very expensive meal, but if you have the money, you will not be disappointed by the food or the service."

The  complimentary Duck Fat Fries are straight addicting. Especially the White Truffle fries.   Our service was excellent, and we never wanted for anything.  Wine list is fantastic, but very pricey. I went with a Pear-Lychee Martini, which my friend commented tasted like his hair product. \n\nWe had wanted to have a glass of wine at Aureole before dinner, but the hostess said if we waited an hour they would be unable to seat us due the the RUSH concert ending. Somehow, I could not fathom hordes of mullet haired Rush fans descending on StripSteak. They never came. But later that evening, as I was happily  losing money in the casino they arrived in droves. So much bad hair and denim jackets\nin one place , reminded me of 1989."

My Kobe Rib Eye was cooked just the way I like it on the inside (a delicate red medium rare), but a little too charred on the outside. The foie gras was the same, too charred on the outside, but melt in your mouth amazing otherwise. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky; his Kansas City Strip was overcooked. We were tempted to send it back, but we typically try not to do that too much. We were both very disappointed, as this was their famous dish after all. The scalloped potatoes were well cooked, but too much on the creamy side for our liking.

I understand that it was a little bit late but you're a hostess, isn't it your job to at least be pleasant when greeting guests?\n\nEven though the service started out crappy, the food made up for it. First it was the free duck fries. I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking ew.. duck fries. It's not really duck, just regular ol' french fries with a new name. The condiments it came with however, nothing close to regular. I remember it was 3 types of condiments, forgot the flavors but remember it being delicious. I think I ended up fighting with my date on who could have the last duck fry. \n\nThe steak..MMMM...mouth watering. *Insert picture of Homer Simpson drooling* I had a petite filet and loved it. My date on the other hand, had Kobe steak. I had a piece of his steak and had entree envy right away. His Kobe beef was exactly how Kobe beef should taste like, tender and full of flavor.\n\nYou would think after pigging out on fries and steak, that we would be done right? WRONG. We decide to order blueberry fritters for dessert. My God were they delicious. Even though I was dying from over eating I couldn't help wanting more. \n\nWe won't discuss the bill.

A lopsided apology at best.\n\nI guess the restaurant feels that with such a transient clientele as a Las Vegas resort has they do not need to extend themselves to diners to make a bad experience right or the food right because most people don't return visit for approximately a year and most are too lazy to write reviews.

So he went back to the kitchen and we jokingly laughed amongst ourselves about how it's just our luck and that this \"sucks for us\". Then another bartender quickly came over and told us that they are doing US a favor by checking to see if the kitchen was open to serve food and that they don't have to serve us. Then it just got awkward. We didn't know where this guy came from and why he was talking to us like that. Maybe he thought we were talking about the restaurant and misunderstood?

My Son said the flavor was amazing and that he was glad he tried it but would probably never order it again because of the texture.  It was soft and gelatinous which was very unappealing to all of us.  We were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary amuse bouche of the duck-fat fries with dipping sauces.  There were plenty for all four of us.  There were three different types of fries and they were all unique and delicious; however, one of them was a little too salty for my palate.  The men thoroughly enjoyed them.  We ordered several of the sides with the stand-out being the truffle and macaroni and cheese.  The cocktail and beer selection was amazing as well.  It was a wonderful dining experience.   The server was knowledgeable and attentive.  She surprised us with complimentary \"kibble\" (out of this world, delicious, chocolate-covered gourmet popcorn) when she delivered our bill.

One of us got the pri-fix menu with the dry aged rib eye. I'd definitely recommend getting the pri-fix menu since you get an appetizer, a trio of sides, and a dessert.

I would have been happy with just that, but I was here to eat steak :)\n\nWe ordered a couple of small plates to start, including the instant bacon (which looks nothing like bacon and a lot like pork belly with a fried oyster on top), bacon-wrapped lobster fritters (freaking amazing), wagyu filet tartare, and froie gras dumplings. They were quite small so yes, there was still room for steak and desserts :) \n\nWe split the bone-in rib eye, medium rare. It didn't need any sauce but we ordered the trio of sauces to try. It was tender and juicy and wonderful! \n\nThe couple we were dining with didn't have room for dessert since they had to finish their wine (and ours) so we split the maple custard. When it first comes out it looks like it will hurt you but it's actually quite nice. \n\nI would say it was a more relaxed steakhouse experience than the typical steakhouse in Vegas or NY. And it was so delicious!"

We then shared the 30oz porterhouse with a side of onion rings. We asked if the chef could make a grilled vegetable plater for us to enjoy. They meet all our needs. Everything was wonderful. I was a little disappointed on the size of filet section of the steak for having been a 30oz porterhouse. The steak had great flavor."

Our waiter Brian was outstanding and made great food from the kitchen into a terrific dining experience.  Brian suggested wines that paired nicely with our entrees, and was patient as we studied the menu.  The duck fat fries were crisp and flavorful, it's hard not to overindulge.   The cold lobster salad with ginger vinaigrette and green goddess dressing was fresh and delicious.  We each had a filet, one American and one Wagyu.  Although each were tender and cooked to perfection, it was hard to pick a favorite.  We also got a side of mushrooms with pearl onions in the best wine sauce.  We were too full to try a dessert.  Of course, we ate the housemade fiddle faddle in the cab ride back to our hotel.  There are so many steak house choices in Vegas, we'll choose this steakhouse again!"

Everything we ordered was exceptional. \n\nWe started with the \"Instant Bacon\" as an appetizer... I had to try it because I was intrigued. While it was tiny, and not quite like your traditional bacon (it is pork belly, more so), it was so freakin good. It was crispy on the outside and sweet, but savory. I had no idea that they also bring out fries with dipping sauces that are amazing as well (the truffle aioli is on point!).\n\nI ordered the 18 oz ribeye. So good.. Cooked perfect with butter on top. The highlight of the meal may actually have been the potatoes au gratin though, believe it or not! They are covered in a rich, smokey Gouda cheese sauce. Unbelievable! It was a good sharing size as well. \n\nThe only downside that I could see was that it was pretty loud in there so you have to basically shout to carry on a decent convo (luckily I was with a fun group :))."

The server brought out the French fries cooked in duck fat with the different season/sauce pairings which was a refreshing take on a nibbler before your meal. I loved the sauce with the truffle in it. \nA bit heavy on the old bay seasoning.\nAppetizer: ordered the crab spring rolls with sriracha aioli. The shell was crispy and the crab was good, but there was just too much oil. \nEntree- I ordered the 10oz Angus filet medium rare. Very nice cut, well seasoned. That was the good. Unfortunately it was cooked unevenly and a bit on the overdone side. The color was nice and red on one side but pink and dry on the other. Didn't mention to waiter so can't comment on recovery. For side we had the French horn mushrooms with a mirin reduction. Great flavor but a bit rubbery. Again I think a problem with the preparation. \nNice touch boxing up leftovers and putting caramel covered popcorn as a takeaway home. Just felt like there was a bit of price gouging for the quality."

I'm not into creamed spinach so I asked if they could just make some sauteed spinach instead.  No problem and this was excellent as well.\n\nSeating is a little weird though.  We were sat in an area that had small round tables up against a long couch with tons of pillows.

My husband had the ribeye with a half lobster tail and I had the brioche crusted bass. His steak was okay but I noticed he cut a lot away and pushed it to the side. My fish was tender and tasty but quite salty. The coffee was very good. I ordered a napoleon and was brought some sort of chocolate mousse or cheesecake dish. My husband ate most of it and I didn't complain because our waiter wasn't around much. The gentleman who filled our water, took away dishes, and filled my coffee was far more attentive. He was fantastic and I wish he had been our waiter.\nSo, overall not a bad meal but not what I expected for the rather high price tag and I certainly didn't expect the waiter to be so inattentive and to bring something I didn't order. If they were out of napoleons, I would have expected him to explain then ask if I wanted something else instead of assuming I might like something else or that I wouldn't know the difference between pastry and cheesecake."

So if you are down to read this whole review, then please do so. If you don't want to read it, I don't really care because I am having fun just reliving the dining experience.\n\nMy sister and I wanted to take our parents here for xmas dinner. Michael Mina restaurant, right? Should be good! We had tickets for Cirque du Soleil's Ka (excellent, by the way) at 7PM so we were definitely on a time crunch. StripSteak does not open until 5:30PM. We called in a little bit early and told them our dilemma and the lady at the front desk said she'd make sure they'd get us out by 6:30. Excellent. We got there about 5:20 and were seated by 5:25. \n\nOur waitress came by and told us she was aware of the timing situation and took our orders immediately. She was really hot by the way. And no, I am not a lesbian. She seated us at a circular table surrounded by 5 comfy lounge looking types of chairs. They were a bit low but they offered us pillows to sit on or to use for our backs. It was very comfy!\n\nOn to the FOOD! Instead of offering the typical pre-meal dinner rolls, the waitress came out with 2 trios of fries. I have no idea what the fries were, but there were 3 types, each with their own dipping sauce. They were awesome! I almost wished she didnt give it to us because I filled up on so much fries when I could have made room for more of the luscious beef that was on its way. Now I must admit, I am a potato addict, so free potatoes was definitely a big plus for StripSteak. Even if I was not a potato fanatic, I think having something different from the typical dinner rolls makes the restaurant stand out from the average high-end steakhouse.\n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the Filet Tartare ($21). Waiter came out with the tartare and told us what garnishes would be going in . He mashed it up and came back with it all nice and pretty on a bed of ice in a small jar. It came with 4 pieces of pita bread. Very delicious!\n\nFor our entrees, my dad and sister's boyfriend ordered the 18 oz Rib Eye ($51 each). My sister ordered the prix fix menu for $55. It came with clam chowder, Prime Rib and samples of random sides, and Beignets. My mother and I shared the 30 oz Porterhouse ($69). For our sides we ordered the Spinach Souffle and Potato Puree Trio. Man o man, there is not one negative thing I could say about the food.  We ordered everything medium rare... and what do you have it... they were actually medium rare!!! The rib eye was absolutely delicious. Definitely one of the best cuts of rib eye I have ever tasted. The porterhouse was excellent as well. They had it cut up into slices for easy sharing between my mom and I. The filet part of the porterhouse was so juicy and tender. The prime rib was just as good. It was also nice to be able to try the 3 samples of sides that came with the prime rib - spinach, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts. All tasted great. The trio of mashed potatoes was unique. The flavors were lobster, sour cream and onion, and horseradish. I'm not a big fan of horseradish, but the sour cream and onion was absolutely amazing. \n\nThe waitress was nice enough to ask us if we wanted the beignets to come after the meal or whenever they were ready since we were running out of time. We said to bring them out whenever they were ready. They were good but not spectacular. The rest of the meal was so amazing, I really didn't care. \n\nMy sister had a restaurant.com coupon and knocked $50 off the meal. The total for the meal with $50 off and an 18% gratuity was $311. Not bad for such an awesome meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It's a bit pricey but definitely offered some of the best steak I have ever had. Give it a try if you are in Vegas!"

            "review": "It honestly kills me to give a Michael Mina restaurant a 3-star review -- I've been to many of his restaurants around the country, and am nearly always thrilled with the service and quality of the food.  Perhaps it was an off-night for the chef, but I left disappointed.\n\nLet me start with the good -- there were 16 of us in our party, and the accommodations were great (it's generally tough to deal with a party that size), as was the service.  Also, the appetizers (tuna and hamachi poppers and fries) were very good.  As was the wedge salad.  And the side dishes were all great.\n\nThe disappointing part of the evening was the main course -- the steak.  I decided on the filet, which was a generous cut and looked great when presented.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked and dry.  The strange part is that -- with all the distraction of the large party -- several my friends and I didn't realize until after the food was delivered that we were never asked how we'd like the steak prepared (to be fair, it sounds like about three-quarters of the party were asked...just not the several sitting near me).\n\nI'm not overly picking about preparation -- I would have been happy with medium-rare or medium -- but the steak came out on the medium-well side.  Worse yet, it was barely warm.  Perhaps a side effect of the large group, but I imagine we weren't the first time the chef has dealt with large parties.  Good rule of thumb -- if the server forgets to ask how someone would like their steak cooked, ere on the medium-rare side, not the medium-well side.  In addition, the steak wasn't seasoned much at all (those this could have been a side-effect of it being overcooked).  \n\nIn retrospect, I should have returned the meat, but by the time the server returned to check on us, many in the group were already halfway through the meal.  \n\nOverall, the experience was great, the service was great and the rest of the meal was great.  But, there's no excuse for a bad steak at a place with \"steak\" in the name, and especially not at a Michael Mina restaurant.  I'm on the fence whether I'll return, though the high ratings in general give me hope that my meal was an exception, not the rule."

The meal total was over $800 or something, but there were no complaints. Just a bunch of very stuffed and happy customers."

At a reputable establishment (same approach with sushi) I will not shy away from this menu item.\n*ANGUS FILET\nThe filet cut was outstanding (makes me wonder what the wagyu would have been) as were the mashed potatoes and mushrooms. We had lots of sides with our meal and while all were good the above mentioned were the stand outs.\n*ROASTED BONE MARROW\nchipotle-chimichurri, grilled sourdough bread\nI've saved the best for last yum, yum, yum.

            "review": "The Skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don't order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) Service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) Value: considering the plethora of deals on Restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).\n\nMy hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at Stripsteak.\n\nAfter passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. By our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. She basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. \n\nShe also didn't tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. Plus, they don't offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you're seated at the table. For this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.\n\nMichael Mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. So obviously our amuse bouche consisted of Bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. The fries had a lovely crispness that retained its texture even when it cooled off. The sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. I considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided I still needed to save my appetite for food we'd ordered. \n\nThe soups were solid but nothing special. The vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. The seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.\n\nThe foie gras sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. The plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.\n\nBy far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. It's rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher's mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. Yes, it is that good. The carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it's hard to find steak that well-prepared. \n\nIt was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. The peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. The truffled mac 'n cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. Unfortunately, the creamed spinach had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.\n\nThe hubby's grilled chicken (they don't fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. Half a grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac 'n cheese. Who wouldn't like this?\n\nWe topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. We loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. The chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.\n\nOverall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the Restaurant.com certificate. We ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (foie gras $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). Subtract the $50 Restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. Definitely a solid four star review."

It is worth the four $$$$ designation. Top 3 steakhouse I've ever frequented and I am not even sure which one or two would beat it based on last night's experience. \n\nAbsolutely phenomenal top to bottom. I'm even going to start with the service - Brian M our server - perhaps the single best server waiter extraordinaire I've ever had service my table at any establishment, ever. We nicknamed him MacGuyver because the guy is like an encyclopedia of knowledge on everything from food to wine to stocks to global hotel expansion to investing to things I cannot even recall. We all offered to hire him for our software technology companies, he was that good. The front end staff was also lovely and friendly, as well as all the bussers and waitstaff.  \n\nThe food... expensive, but worth it. The fries they bring out, with the sauces, awesome. We all had the 10 oz filet... cut like butter... awesome. The sides, potatoes, lobster mac n cheese... spectacular. The caramel dessert, the port wine, and the overall wine selection, all on point. \n\nCannot say enough about this restaurant. Even our booth, between all the glass, wood, and open space floor plan, was sexy and cool and fun. Just a great place. Take your wife, your clients, whoever to StripSteak. And hope Brian M is working...."

            "review": "When my friends told me we were going to a place called Strip Steak, I was assuming we'd be eating steak and watching strippers. What's wrong with that combination? Steak... good! Strippers... good! In a fantasy world, such a place would exist. Unfortunately, that was not the case. At least they had great steak and that more than made up for the lack of strippers.  Turns out the strip in Strip Steak was because the restaurant was located in the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Ooooh. I get it.\nWhat makes Strip Steak special is not strippers but how they cook their steaks. From what I understood from the waitress, they braise their steaks to the proper doneness and then finish them over an open flame for color. A boiled steak? Don't knock it till you try it. Seriously the third best steak I've ever had. The number one spot goes to a Kobe Steak I had in Tokyo.\n\nThe only thing Strip Steak could improve on is if they offered more dry aged cuts of steak. At the time of this post, they only offered their Rib Eye dry aged. Our group ordered our steaks in a variety of doneness. One in our group got them to cook a steak the rarest the restaurant has ever cooked it. They've only done it one other time since they opened. Talk about an accomplishment, to be the second person to have a steak this rare. They are on the strip after all. Instead of par boiling the steak, they pulled it straight out of the fridge, quickly placed over the flame, and served it. To our surprise, there wasn't even a drop of blood on the plate. \n\nThe next time I go, I'll try the $200 Japanese Kobe 6oz filet mignon, but unfortunately, I \"donated\" that money to \"Red 14\". Any steak on the menu will definitely please your palate. One of our group suggests the lamb. Not gamey at all."

Helpful Hint: I had to ask for the pre-fixe menu.  They do not just give it to you.  Also, they said that the rib eye on the pre-fixe menu is the same size as the regular order.\nBefore the regular appetizers and entr\u00e9es, they brought out 3 cups of French fries, each cooked differently (including one in duck fat) and each with a different dipping sauce (ketchup, aioli, and truffle oil).  I thought the fries cooked in the duck fat with the truffle oil sauce were great (10/10).  You just can't go wrong with truffles.\nI had the crab cake as an appetizer.  It was a lump crab cake, which is my favorite, as it had chunks of crab instead of shredded pieces.  It was very good (9/10).   It reminded me of Legal Sea Foods on the east coast.\nI had the rib eye was my main dish and they did slightly overcook it.  It was supposed to be med-rare, but it came out closer to medium.  The meat was tender and had a dry rub on it.  It was a very good steak (similar to Ruth's Chris, Capital Grill), but not in the upper echelon (Maestros, SW Steakhouse, Del Friscos). 8/10.\nI had the root beer float with 2 chocolate cookies for desert.  The cookies were soft and warm and tasted good.  The root beer float had 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream, but it also had a scoop of a frozen root beer.  It was a nice way to finish off a meal, but it was nothing spectacular. 6/10\n\nService\nThe waitress was full of energy and was friendly.  She checked up on us throughout the meal and made sure we were doing ok.  I would love to have her again.  10/10\n\nAmbiance\nI could call the restaurant modern and trendy, not old and stuffy.  It has glass partitions between booths so it has an open air concept.  They have different furniture in different areas so it looks like they tried to create \"sections\" without having walls.  You can see the meat handing and aging in the center of the restaurant.  9/10."

Upon being seated, we were provided with a platter of 3 different kinds of fries with 3 different types of dips complimentary! I don't recall what each different kind of fries and dips (well, one was kethcup lol), but they all tasted great and got the meal started off right. \n\nFor dinner, I decided to have the 10 oz Filet Mignon, along with a side of their charred asparagus. I must say, the Filet was incredible! A perfectly cooked medium, the meat melted in my mouth like butter, and had a nice seasoning crust on it as well. 10 oz might not sound like much, but it was more than filling, and the asparagus was great as well. \n\nProbably my only complaint, for such an expensive restaurant, the ambiance could have been a little more \"eye-catching', but the food was definitely up to par. All in all, a perfect, \"man's\" meal to kick off our bachelor party weekend (though definitely a pricey one)!"

It was the worst spent $700 ever. We made a reservation for 7 people about 1 month ago since we were going to be in town for a trade show. Our last appointment ran late, so four of us showed up the restaurant late. 3 were already there, but couldn't be seated until the missing 4 arrived. They could have been ordering drinks and appetizers, but instead, the table sat empty.  \n\nWe arrived and were told that we could eat, but that we would have to be out of our table by 9. Okay, that is fair, but how they treated us after that was not.  \n\nWe had plenty of time to eat, in fact we finished 20 minutes before 9. But we kept getting pushed...the waiter first said that he would choose out appetizers (because us reading the menu for 2 mins was too much) He kept reminding us that we were in a hurry. We rushed through our food and at 8:40 the waiter gave us dessert menus, threw some fiddle faddle packages, courtesy of the chef, on the table, and said that we could choose dessert and that we MIGHT have time to eat it.  Seriously guy? \n\nGratuity was included. We didn't give a penny more.  On the way out we commented to the hostess that they could have handled that situation way differently.  Understating that we had to be done by 9, they could have sped things up in the kitchen instead of constantly reminding us that we needed to rush. She argued with us instead of apologizing.  That is not customer service. \n\nEven more disappointing, we LOVE Michael Mina restaurants.  And planned ALL Michael Mina restaurants for our trip. This Michael Mina restaurant let us down :( But--American Fish (Aria) and Michael Mina (Bellagio) are both excellent!!!"

The porterhouse was the perfect cut for us to share, and it was juicy, tender, and well-seasoned. The star of the night was the souffled spinach, which was so unique. It walked a fine line between savory and sweet, because I expected every bite to taste sweet (I'm thinking it's a souffle!) but it tasted like spinach. I would highly recommend it! The mushrooms were good too, but definitely get the spinach.\n\nMy friend had the Stripsteak which had really good flavor but was a tad on the chewy side.

At first the service seemed very slow but as the night progressed, the service level of attentiveness did not change. So expectations were not necessarily met when compared to the service received during happy hour. Also, having dined at Tom Colicchio's Heritage steak restaurant the night before, where the experience and atmosphere was much better put a damper when dining here and raised the bar of expectation. \n\n**Food**\n\nAs a complimentary dish from the chef, we were given the trio of duck fat fries. One is the truffle   fries accompanied by a truffle aioli, next is the herb tossed fries paired with ketchup, finally the old bay seasoned fries are paired with a mustard sauce. The truffle seasoned fries along with the truffle aioli were the favorite. \n\nFor salad, we ordered the BLT wedge, which was very refreshing and very leveled in flavor given the bacon, maytag bleu cheese, and buttermilk dressing. As for the main course, we ordered the 8oz. Mishima reserve rib cap and the 16oz dry-aged boneless rib eye. I must say that after trying both cuts, the cap was superb. Literally melts in your mouth, by impacting it with full of flavor. I suppose that's the benefit of a wagyu vs. angus and cap vs. rib eye. The boneless rib eye slightly lacked flavor when compared to the cap. For side, we ordered the potato gratin which comes with a smoked gouda sauce that is drizzle over and creates a bed of sauce for the gratin. \n\nWe finished our meal with the beignets accompanied with vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The combination is divine. I have previously tried the other two sauces, salty caramel pot de creme and butterscotch pudding, but the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e by far is the top winner and goes perfectly with the beignets. \n\nIn all, it is not over the top expensive, but not cheap either. Hopefully, our next visit might be more pleasant with the ambiance and service. For now, I'll stick to the happy hour or dining at the bar, where service is more attentive.\n\nOne more thing, a few reviewers noted receiving complimentary popcorn at the end of their meal as a token of appreciation, I suppose none were provided that night, as we were not fortunate to receive a bag ."

            "review": "The wife and I met a friend of mine for dinner at Stripsteak on a Monday night.  We were very familiar with Michael Mina's steakhouse concept having enjoyed his Bourbon Steak, one of our favorite places in DC, on multiple occasions.  As a result, we had high expectations for Stripsteak.  Stripsteak occupies an open, modern-looking, high-ceilinged, well-lit space along Restaurant Row in Mandalay Bay.  Since we had early reservations at 6pm, the dining room was virtually empty except for us.  Given that we practically had the place to ourselves, the service was solid and our food came out expeditiously, hot and fresh throughout our meal.\n\nOur meal started out with Mina's signature amuse of Duck Fat Fries with a trio of dipping sauces.  The fries were hot and crispy.  They were a nice prelude to our meal, but still...just fries.  Stripsteak's strength is in its wood-fire grilled proteins.  I had the 8 oz. American Wagyu Rib Cap, medium rare.  My rib cap came out cooked precisely to my requested doneness, seasoned with restraint with only salt and pepper, was fork tender, and was, not unexpectedly, wonderfully juicy and flavorful.  It was the perfect treatment of this treasured cut of meat.  We shared orders of the Roasted Wild Mushrooms and Mac & Cheese with black truffle sides.  The mushrooms, a mix of maitake, oyster, and possibly another variety, were earthy, tender, and possessed subtle smoky notes from the wood-fire roasting.  The mac & cheese possessed distinct but balanced truffle flavor.  It was a solid and enjoyable upscale rendition of a comfort food staple.\n\nStripsteak served up an excellent meal that lived up to our expectations.  As steak joints go, it held its own with Las Vegas' best steakhouses.  It's not for the budget-conscious, but thankfully on this evening, my buddy picked up the tab.  4.5 stars!"

We had been trying to eat here for months but every time we tried to book online through OpenTable it said they were booked. I called and easily got in at our desired time. The restaurant was not busy at all even though their online booking system said they were full. If we didn't have the Restaurant.com coupon we would have probably given up on trying to get in. \nWe had the filet Mignon/ medium rare- Spectacular and perfectly Medium rare.\nPotato trio- get it even though you already ate the amazing fries. They are yummy.\n Spicy zucchini- Delicious but very spicy. We were glad to have the potatoes to cool them down."

So tender but not bloody which I usually expect a bit from a rare steak. Amazing frois gras that melts in your mouth and mac and cheese to die for (if you like garlic especially). I also absolutely loved the lobster mashed potatoes. Our waitress was awesome as well and very patient as we took a good 20-30 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order between wine and food. The complimentary fries with dipping sauce may be the cherry on top of this dining experience. Only negative I can say is it was a bit loud and difficult to talk to those in your party especially a small party. Don't expect to get out of here for less than $300 with 2 people. Worth the splurge if you can swing it or atleast had a good night at the tables!"

The 4 different french fries \"compliments of the chef\" were a nice touch.  The pork cutlet was HUGE and unremarkable.  Mostly, like most of Las Vegas, it was just okay and overpriced.  It even falls down by that usual standard, though, because the ambiance is poor, and service was glacial."

They were incredible.  I also really enjoyed the complimentary french fries with dipping sauces, and baked bread before the meal. \n\nThe decor is stunning, and the restaurant is ideal for a group setting.  \n\nIf I was rating this review on just the above, then I would generously give Strip Steak 5 stars, however, my 3 star review is based on service.  This is what we experienced while dining:\n\n1) My friend's steak was cold in the middle. Not sure how long our meal was sitting out, but this should never happen at an upscale steakhouse. \n\n2) My other friend's halibut was not cooked throughout, hence leaving a very salty, bitter taste. \n\n3) The service was slow. We sat down for an 8 pm reservation and did not get out of there until after 11 pm.  \n\n4) I ordered Bearnaise sauce with my meal and it did not come out with my steak. I had to wait until the server took another trip to the kitchen to finally bring it out. \n\nThese inconveniences should never happen at a restaurant where our final bill comes to $900 for 7 people.  I won't be coming back here.\n\n*If you are in Vegas there are PLENTY of other phenomenal steakhouses* Do your yelping research...."

We started off with the lobster fritters. Yummy..and I don't enjoy any type of seafood , but these were tasty. I split them with my husband and because there were only 3.. We fought over the remaining one...\nNext the waitress brought out these too die for French fries . 3 kinds with 3 different dipping sauces .. I devoured these (it was 9pm and I was STARVING). My husband asked if we may have more and the waitress responded yes but we will have to charge you $8... Are you kidding me... $8 when I'm already spending $250 on a dinner for 2.. Whatever!! She brought out another batch and we ate them.\nI ordered the rib eye Medium Rare and the hubby had the flat iron.. Both of us thought the meat was tough and lacked flavor.. For $60 a steak shouldn't it have been cut with a butter knife and melt in your mouth?\nWe split the potato pur\u00e9e and all 3 were delicious. The server was nice and attended to us well. We left full and skipped dessert. \nOverall very nice dinner but I prefer Vic and Anthony's or vodoo lounge steak house to this one"

So I called this location to set the reservation and even asked for a confirmation number which I was given. Guess what happened when I arrived for my reservation? That's right you guessed it, didn't show up. Luckily it was 9pm, so it wasn't that busy so I got sat immediately. \n\nService. \nThe host apologized for the reservation mishap. Our waiter was a great guy. He basically made my night. \n\nFood. \nThe restaurant gives complementary duck fat fries? One word DELICIOUS. Party of two we ordered 1 appetizer 2 entr\u00e9es and 2 sides. We got the oysters which had 6 oysters (3 from the west coast and 3 from the east coast)    The West coast oyster is ehh. The east coast ones however were perfect. For our entr\u00e9es we got a waygu filet 8oz and the ribeye 16oz. MAN WERE THEY GOOD. the waygu comes highly recommended. The tenderness is just unexplainable. The ribeye is just as any other place. I did add a blue cheese crumbs to my steak, however the cheese made the steak a little salty so unfortunately I had to remove a lot of the cheese. The steaks were cooked under a firewood grill it did have a bit of a charcoal flavor. The sides we got broccolini and black truffle Mac and cheese. Both were delicious. \n\nPrice. \nVery reasonable for a part of two. About 125 per person. \n\nLook at the pictures."

Not a huge fan of the fois gras trend of sweet and savory like the french toast approach, so I was happily game.

The ribeye was really good. Grill to exact request it was smooth and full of flavor. The Ceasar wasn't that great. When we ordered ours without anchovies it came with it anyway. What threw me a bit was the total lack of craft beer selection. Several pages of fantastic wines but no draft craft beer selection. Only bottles and sub par beer selection at that. Basically not the type of beer you want to complement a five star steak with. A little shocked actually. So one star for not what we ordered and one star for no craft beer."

Of course here! I went with no appetizers and straight to the ordering of the beautiful 40oz Australian tomahawk steak! It will run you $145 and it's a perfect steak for two people unless you are like a hungry cave man and can eat all that meat by yourself! Cooked medium with a blue cheese crust was my customizing of the steak and it came out perfect I had no complaints! For the sides we choose the mac n cheese followed by the potatoes m! Yum yum! It was all prepared so delicious and yes it was worth every penny I have to say thanks to Mandalay bay for that food and beverage credit because I'm not sure I would've paid for that all alone! Haha a real happy birthday to me it was! Our waiter brought out these little candies on a plate with happy birthday written in there for me which was a nice touch! All in all a great meal!

Our server had a large table and a couple other small ones in addition to us, so taking as long as she did to get our orders is forgiveable.  She was friendly and responsive when we did see her, so I'm sure it was just a tough night.\n\nThe hostesses were less pleasant, mumbling responses and then practically ignoring us.  If we hadn't had reservations for dinner and tickets to a show right after, I would have gone somewhere else right then.\n\nNow let's get to the great part - the food!  We both had steaks, one a filet and the other a ribeye, both of which were expertly cooked to order.  He added shrimp and I crab legs, neither of which was as large as I'm used to, being from the coast.  But it's understandable this far inland, and both were cooked and seasoned well.\n\nWe each ordered a side, mushrooms and broccolini, and let me tell you, each was large enough to serve two people.  I was definitely impressed with those portion sizes.\n\nCocktails were nothing special, tho the Scottish stout beer my other half enjoyed was the best he's had.  The dessert menu looked nice, but nothing really jumped out at us.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience.  Perhaps I'm too \"small-town\" to enjoy the full Vegas Strip experience, but this was a good meal and a great precursor to a FABULOUS Cirque show.  I would recommend this restaurant to others heading to Vegas."

The chowder was different and interesting, a good start to dinner. The meat was good though a little tough considering the price. The rib eye was huge (18oz), I would opt for the prime rib next time. The root beer floats were okay... the sorbet was icy as you can imagine. The cookies included pistachios which we did not touch due to allergies (it would've been nice if the manager went out of his way to have cookies made w/o nuts for us).\n\nThe mushrooms were excellent and a very good serving size for two people. They were often over-powering the steak flavor though. The best part of dinner I thought was the three small sides that came with the steak: truffled mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, and creamed spinach. The brussel sprouts were amazing!\n\nAll in all, our dining experience was good. I would return to this restaurant and try something else on the menu anytime!"

Sashimi was awesome too, and the nice touch is that there was real wasabe and not the pasty generic kind. Tasty and sentious : 4.75 out of 5.\n\nGinger beer nice selection, as suggested by the server when I ordered ginger ale. 4.5\n\nFlight of fries was cute and noshy.. very bistro chic. 4.5\n\nMarrow : delicious and rich. Served with perfectly sized toastettes... 5\n\nDry aged rib eye 3.5 out of 5. Hate to say it, but a bit too much marbling and gristle. I would rate the meat quality as a choice cut, but not prime or Angus. Also, I would have expected the steak to be served decently hot, but it came to the table cooler than being let to rest after cooking.  The smokey (Alder) was a bit more overwhelming than expected and I felt it impeded the taste you should be getting from proper aged beef.  I know I'm being a bit critical here, but I have had awesome creations from Mina and know he can purvey far better. Maybe it was an off night.. \n\nNoise: dang loud. But it's Vegas. \n\nService: Decent but seemingly with slow dips. I was disappointed with a few things though. The server was very nice for the most part but did two things a server should not do:\n\nFirst:  Please never clear one diner's plate before the other diner has finished the course. IT isn't proper etiquette. \n\nSecond:  when offered the taste of the ginger beer, it truly was a good selection. I hadn't even drank the ginger ale yet. The server was a tad patronizing in stating she would get me the ginger beer as well, and did not remove the ginger ale from the tab. Partially my fault for not asking for a taste, but the proper manner should have been to be offered a taste first before bringing me both. I know it wasn't malicious.. and it was during the Consumer Electronics Show, so she may have had her fill with attendees that didn't know proper dining etiquette.  2/5\n\nI say overall itWould I go back? Yes.. Kinda like learning a new country and their customs, I know what to focus on more. I'll be back in Vegas in a few weeks and will give them a try again because I do see the potential."

            "review": "Food, cocktails, service, and decor were all fantastic. As others have mentioned, the duck fat fries are a highlight, and the scalloped potatoes were delicious as well. The truffle mac and cheese is a must-have. I personally think the appetizers were better than the steak, although that was very good as well. The service was very friendly and attentive, and the server was very knowledgeable about the food and made some great suggestions for what we should try. Great dining experience!"
