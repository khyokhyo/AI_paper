            "review": "Edible but in no way enjoyable. The \"Perfecto Patron\" margarita was far from perfect. The menu states that it's made with lime juice, but the taste was strictly syrupy mix. The corn tamale appetizers were a sacrilege: there is no reason to deep fry tamales, which is why I stupidly ignored the menu's description that they were \"fried crisp.\" Unfortunately, regarding the tamales, the menu was accurate. The final disappointment was the shredded beef burrito, which was simultaneously spicy and lackluster. The one decent item that we ordered was also the least Mexican--the steak salad. And it was not a WOW! rendition, it was just, thankfully, not a What!?! It is also worth noting that there is a charge for the perfectly average chips and salsa. All in all, our experience was underwhelming and unsatisfying. I won't be heading back."

Located in the NY NY casino, this small place looked like another food counter place.  There was no food counter, but should have been.  Although slightly better than Taco Bell, there was nothing special about this place.  The meal was so so.  Service was slow and unhelpful as well.  Maybe I came here on an off night.  Doesn't matter, because I ain't coming back."

            "review": "We were staying at the NY-NY Hotel Casino, so we thought we'd try Gonzalez Y Gonzalez for a pre-show dinner.  Arrived at 5:30 PM and were seated in the dining room right away.  The baseball playoffs were on the bar T.V. which is part of the front dining room.  At the bar were 5 younger guys watching the game, and one of them was so drunk he was barely able to sit on his stool.  On most plays, he would scream and shout so loud that it completely disrupted the dining experience, and I could tell that everyone around us was disturbed by this.  However, the bartender continued to serve him.  Even his friends were telling him to quiet down.  The manager came over and spoke with him, but apparently didn't ask them to leave as they all remained (and the disruptive show continued). \n\nThe food was good, although nothing exceptional.  The restaurant charges a nominal (I think it was $2.95) for chips and salsa, which were good.  The service was average to above average.  Overall, I would say give it a try, but they lose one star for food that was nothing special and one star for the manager failing to ask a drunk,"

In fact, the chicken taco was probably among the best I've had at a sit-down Mexican restaurant. The chile relleno was also excellent, though the breading was a bit on the heavy side. The cheese inside was fantastic and the rice and beans that accompanied the two were good as well.\n\nI left a very happy, full gringo that night."

Went there with my brother on our vegas trip to grab a giant margarita to begin our trek down the strip but decided to have some food before diving head first into a day of drinking. \n\nSteak nachos were good and tasted really fresh. Chips and salsa were free for the first and were above par imo. Prices kinda sucked but its on the strip. Margarita was nice and strong which had me surprised, because I was expecting it to be weak as hell. Overall good place"

            "review": "Gonzalez Y Gonzalez is located in the NYNY casino resort. It's in the food court \"alley way\" near the ThePark LasVegas exit door. \nThe restaurant has family style seating,as well as a bar area, and patio style seating over looking the \"alley way\" walkway. There are wall mounted TV's in the bar area. \nAtmosphere: inviting while being very unassuming. The color schematic is traditional golden hues of yellow, red, and rustic orange. The booths are large allowing plenty of elbow room. Tables are spaced in such a way as to not impede the flow of traffic. \nStaff: customer service here is impeccable. Your server, the next tables server, and the host all greet you with a warm and genuine smile. Their attention to detail, empty cups, finished dishes, and low chips is what makes this place extra special. \nFood: EXCELLENT, no other word would do it justice. It's more of a TexMex style, but that is my preferred way. My burrito was stuffed with meat and beans and covered in a nice layer of red sauce. It was large enough that it could be shared, but we all know by now, I do NOT share. The beans were creamy and smooth with the right amount of cheese to top. The chips were made fresh on site as is the salsa, which has just the right amount of kick and hint of lime. The one thing I would change is the rice, it could almost be a tad more tender. All in all, this was an excellent lunch/dinner option. The cost was agreeable as well."

We chose J&J based on reviews posted here & we are glad we did! The atmosphere was calm & quiet which was a pleasant refuge from the noise & bustle of the strip, the staff was great & the food was awesome! We expected the margaritas to be the standard sour mash lime mixture but we were ecstatic to find out we were wrong! The drinks were real lime juice & had a pretty heavy pour on the booze. Also I was expecting the prices to be 2 or 3 times more expensive than they should be just like everything else on the strip but was very happy to find that prices were about average with any good Mexican restaurant that you would find in any town USA. Check it out!"

I would totally pay about $7 for my Chimichanga...but not a penny more. My husband and I both got chimichangas- his was chicken and I got ground beef. There was flavor, but mostly of onion. Our meals both came with some cold, bland spanish rice and refried beans. We did get the free chips and salsa, but I've better of both in Denver. I'm not sure why everyone is so impressed that they are free. The waiter didn't even come back to see if our food was okay...instead he just stood around staring into space since we were his only table. If you've have real Mexican food at any point in you're life don't waste your time or money at Gonzalez y Gonzalez."

We didn't finish and they boxed it up, along with extra chips & salsa for us... napkins, cutlery, etc. \n\nOnce the game ended, it calmed down a ton.

The Salsa for the chips was amazing. I was actually pleasantly surprised because everyone knows that good salsas are hard to come by. The restaurant is adjacent to a bar/club with great variety of Latin music. If you are looking to get your feet wet in to the night scene in Vegas but are timid or shy and not quiet ready to make the plunge this is a great transitional place you can go to. Because if you are not feeling like dancing or getting out there quite yet then you can finish your food and not dance. But if you so feel like dancing then you can step right into the scene. Overall great service and a good experience. Another neat fact is that there is actually a Gonzalez Gonzalez in New York City. I love the way the hotel has all kinds of restaurants that are in NY."

Like everyone else says, it's cool they give everybody their own salsa. What sticks out was the extremely fast turn around time from when we ordered to when we got our food - I'd say it was less than 15 minutes, tops. I had the tortilla soup, which was less than $7. Arkady ordered the enchiladas which were around $18, he didn't eat them all, and he left his to-go box there. Ooops! \n\nI'd definitely be back, but I wish I had gotten a stamp on the frequent diner's card. Go there 5 times and you get a $15 dining credit. Not bad at all."

Chips and salsa - for FREE - was a nice change from the other Mexican place we tried (Yolos @ Planet Hollywood), and the salsa had a nice smoky flavor to it.  \n\nMy chicken tortilla soup was just how I like it - good amount of broth-to-food ratio and everything was super flavorful - I looooove my cilantro, that's for sure! Chicken was nice and tender.  We also shared an appetizer of chicken taquitos, which also had a nice blast of flavor and topped with some deeeeeelicous cheese.  \n\nGood pick if you want something more on the casual side."

It was a dinner special that day and it consisted of grilled chicken chunks, grilled veggies and a side of cornbread chorizo stuffing. My mouth was uber-happy (and as many of you may know, Mexican isn't even in my top 5 favorites.)\n\nFor Vegas it was pretty reasonable too - huge marg, couple beers, two entrees and it was around $40.

Now I don't get what it is about places like this that have multiple TV's and have all the TV's on the same game while there are multiple games on different channels.  I mean, stagger some TV's between different games yanno people?  We don't all want to watch the same commercials on every TV.\n\nAnyhow, the food.\n\nI sat at the bar and got a margarita that was pretty good.  I got some chips and salsa.  After reading some other reviews here, I'm kinda miffed.  They only brought me the red salsa, I didn't even get to try the green one!  Bastards!  The chips were HOT when they brought them out, and were light and flavorful, good chips.  The red salsa was adequate in flavor but lacked a little heat, so nothing outstanding there.\n\nThe bartender asked if I was 'really hungry' while I perused the menu.  I said sure I guess, so he suggested the Fajita burrito.  That choice sounded fine so that's what I got.  It was served fairly quickly and yeah it was a good sized burrito served with rice and beans.  The meat was not bad, heavy taste on the marinade, but did seem to be cooked alright.  The burrito itself was heavy, the guacamole did not taste fresh, and the sauce they put on the burrito seemed distracting to the taste of the fajitas.\n\nMy biggest peeve was the the side rice and beans were not good at all.  The rice lacked flavor and seemed stale, and the beans were horrid.  I've tasted better beans right out of a can of Rosarito.  I only ate about half of what was on the plate and that's highly unusual for me. \n\nSo overall this seemed a decent place to grab a margie and a tequila shot, but I don't plan on eating here again."

Entering from the doors nearest the Brooklyn Bridge, the restaurant was very easy to find fairly close to where we came in.\n\nThe hostess was very friendly and we were seated immediately, even though it was a Saturday night. The restaurant is fairly noisy, but not so much that you're annoyed. It's not quiet and intimate, but it's not loud and douchey like a sports bar can be. It appears that there are no booths, only tables. However, the tables are far enough apart that you don't feel as though you're dining with a family of 60 when there.\n\nChips and salsa are not complimentary - we asked only after they weren't brought to us. They are VERY tasty however, so I recommend the $3 or whatever to get them; the serving is generous, and the salsa fire-roasted goodness.\n\nI ordered the Arrachera, which is the restaurant's version of a carne asada platter. Holy crap, was it AMAZING! SO flavorful, and so perfectly cooked! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It comes with a small cup of \"drunken beans\" which I totally suggest dipping the meat into before each bite - jackpot in your mouth!\n\nI ordered an El Coco Loco margarita, and let me tell you - it was a religious experience, as if the food wasn't good enough. The ingredients are Malibu, tequila, pina colada mix, and sweet & sour mix, blended. I'm not kidding when I say it tasted almost exactly like Smarties Candy. Unreal, and so damned good!\n\nOur waiter and one other guy that served us were not terribly friendly; normally, I would have dinged a star for that, but the food is SO good that it made up for not becoming BFFs with the wait staff. The guys should have been more personable, and I hope they aren't indicative of the rest of the staff's attitude at Gonzalez Y Gonzalez.\n\nThis is our new go-to Mexican place on The Strip, and I cannot wait to hit it again the next time we're in town! I'd highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone looking for amazing, affordable Mexican food in Vegas!"

There are quite a few appetizers to choose from as well, most being around $8-9.\n\nI ordered a simple house margarita on the rocks with rim which was pleasant, not too tart, possibly a little light alcohol, but good none-the-less. My BF ordered the sangria which he loved so much that he didn't even save me a sip!\n\nWe decided to go for the Crab Guacamole (just under $12) and were pleasantly surprised to find that this was prepared table side, to your specifications. The serving of this appetizer is just about enough for 3 people to share. A generous portion served with a good stack of chips and pitas.\n\nFor mains, I had the Steak Fajita while the BF ordered the pork carnitas. Both are served with sides of refritos and rice, while the fajitas also came with pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream. \n\nThe steak fajitas is enough for 2 people, especially if you started with an appetizer. I am not afraid to stuff my face and there just was no way I could finish my meal. The leftovers will make a great lunchtime sandwich!\n\nThe pork for the carnitas was quite good too if just a little too sweet for my taste. That said, my BF devoured it. \n\nOnce finish, our waiter happily brought over some take-out boxes along with some utensils. \n\nMy notes would be that the waiter seemed somewhat overwhelmed with an unexpected rush mid-afternoon. The margarita, as mentioned, was a little light on alcohol, I think they are more used to making the frozen margaritas. \n\nOverall, I would eat here again but only order an app or two and then share an entree as the portions are quite large."

He never left our glasses half empty (or half full for you optimists), was always attentive, but never intrusive. \n\nFOOD\n+ Carne asada street tacos ($15.95): The steak was tender with a really good marinated flavor, and the tomatillo salsa gave it a spicy, but not in your face, kick.\n- Burrito ($14.95): My friend didn't care for this at all and barely ate it. Francisco offered to give her something else on the house, which was not needed, but very appreciated.\n+ Chips and Salsa ($2.95): Not included unlike other Mexican restaurants. The mesquite roasted tomato salsa gave the warm tortilla chips a unique flavor profile.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis restaurant is a step above Taco Bell and is Americanized to suit the masses. If you don't feel like walking the Vegas Strip to find something better, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez is a safe bet."

My wife and I weren't actually expecting much given that it's in a casino / hotel but we were very pleasantly surprised to find out the food, service and prices were excellent.  Quite authentic Mexican cuisine and service was very personal and attentive.  Probably the least expensive sit down restaurant in this hotel.  Overall, a great value, decent atmosphere, and food and service that we're be sure to come back for when in town again."

I ordered the pozole and she ordered the tortilla soup cause she wasn't feeling too well. It definitely hit the spot though!! I've only had homemade pozole once which happened to be my first time and so I figured right now try this one, plus I was craving it! My pozole was super delicious, just perfect! We also ordered the table side guacamole, it wasn't bad, but definitely not worth $8.75.\n\nI do have to say that the 4 stars were for the food, maybe a star for service and it was lacking it. The hostesses up front weren't very friendly, more like in a hurry. When my girlfriend and I were seated, it took 10 mins for someone to come ask us what we wanted to drink. I understand if it was a weekend but it's Monday. \n\nOf course I will give this restaurant another shot next time we are back here, or staying at the Monte Carlo again."

If you sit out on their patio, you can enjoy the feeling of sitting out on a patio in NY. You are surrounded by decorated walls that are transformed into apartment buildings, cafe's, little tables to look like people are eating outside restaurants in NY. I have never been to NY so it was cool checking things out while we enjoyed a few drinks before our meal.\n\nEverything about this dining experience was good, except my sister receiving the wrong order. For some reason our waiter thought she said something different then what she wanted, so when our order came out we had to send hers back and the waiter had to put in her order. I ordered the nachos, which were ok. They come on large home made chips, with steak, cheese, jalapenos and guacamole. The steak was a little tough to chew through which was disappointing, but their guacamole was pretty tasty. My sister ordered their taquitos. They weren't bad, nice and simple dish, dip them in their chipotle sauce and they were actually pretty tasty. Besides getting the wrong order out first and her having to wait for the taquitos everything else was nice. Our waiter was polite and quick, the scenery was cool and the drinks were delicious."

After my initial review, I was contacted by a manager, who apologized for my and my family's experience, and she told me to please let her know when we were in Vegas next, and she would make sure we had a better experience.\n\nMy parents ended up in Vegas a few months later with two friends, and since they were with me on our first visit, and they paid for it, I figured they should be able to enjoy the free visit. They called and let the management know they were coming before a show, and were treated to a completely free meal, including drinks. \n\nFrom all accounts, the meal they had was great. The manager gave them what she considered her \"best\" server, who my parents agreed was attentive, charming and responsive. My parents and their friends enjoyed an appetizer, entrees and plentiful drinks, and had no complaints. My father even ordered a seafood dish and said it really surpassed his expectations. \n\nIf this had been the only time we'd been to this restaurant, it obviously would be a 5 star review. However, it was pretty clear that the amazing service my family received was due to our previously bad experience, so I have to take that into account. Also, although they were treated to their drinks, they retail price for margaritas was nearly $16 dollars each, which is a pretty pricey margarita. They were pretty good, but definitely not the best we've had, and certainly not worth their normal price tag. I'm not sure we would come back immediately, since our two experiences obviously differ wildly, but if we were coming for appetizers only, I might consider it again. Their willingness to correct their mistakes, especially in a town where repeat customers are not always a realistic goal, make me more inclined to visit again in the future."

The server did not seem like he cared much about doing a good job, and he didn't even check back with us after we received our food. We ordered chips and salsa (they cost $2.95, but it seems like it is typical for Mexican restaurants to charge for chips and salsa in Vegas). The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. If that's the only thing you order there, you're doing yourself a favor. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito (it cost over $10, which seemed a little pricey), and it did not come with beans and rice on the side. I also did not get an option of what type of beans I wanted in my burrito, and that seems odd for a Mexican restaurant. I received my order very quickly, and once I started eating I realized why. It was a store bought, flour tortilla, with over cooked rice and I'm guessing canned re-fried  beans inside. The cheese inside was not completely melted. It was truly the worst Mexican food I've ever had, and I'm originally from California, so I've had good, authentic Mexican food. I would also avoid the margaritas at this place. They are very costly, and there is very little alcohol in them. You're better off buying a dollar margarita in one of the casinos. Overall, do yourself a favor and go to a different Mexican restaurant."

The atmosphere is nothing all that special, but it's got strings of Christmas lights and a decent sized patio to give it a little ambiance. \n\nThe food was average Tex-Mex at average Tex-Mex prices. They've got tacos, burritos, salads, combo plates, chips, salsa, guac, and a comprehensive list of tasty margaritas (even a 3-foot-tall one!). \n\nOne thing that made this place great was the service -- I was staying at NY NY with a 15-person group for a bachelor/bachelorette party and the hostesses, waiters, and servers were all VERY nice and accommodating and actually seemed genuinely excited to have our group there. Even when we got a little bit rowdy and loud, nobody blinked an eye or said a thing and they were overly helpful in getting our orders, separate checks, and drinks taken care of easily and quickly. \n\nI wouldn't go here if I was in the mood for the best, most authentic Mexican food, but given the convenience of it, their great service, and the fact that the food was tasty enough and decently priced, I'd definitely go back."

I was glad someone had posted a picture of the food because it sold me. :) I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the area.  Very good stuff!"

Me an my boyfriend and other people are lined up to get seated at the restaurant. The hostess seemed to be plainly ignoring us while she was taking her sweet time gossiping with a waitress. I think the whole line of people were glaring at her while she was gossiping instead of seating us.\n\nAfter a long while, she seats the first party. at least 5 minutes later she seats me and my boyfriend. Seriously?! how long does it take to seat a party of 2?\n\nService inside was not much better. We ordered food and got our free chips and salsa (saving grace). One of our friends decided to join us. The server is NO where to be found. Finally find him and flag him down to put in our friends order. Later, 2 more of our friends join us and same problem. \n\nI've never been in the restaurant business, but logically I would think big party = great bill = potentially more tip? Guess it didn't matter to him that we normally tip 25%. I was upset at the wait and having to literally find him ourselves most of the time. I told my bf to dock the tip. \n\nFood was alright. Standard stuff. Like the free chips and salsa."

Two stars for the lack of vegan options in pretty-vegan-friendly Las Vegas.  We were able to eat the guac and chips, and then we had to cobble together tacos that ended up being pinto beans, slices of avocado, lettuce, and tomato.  Rice?  Made with chicken stock.  Black beans? Made with chicken stock. Refried beans? Made with lard.  A cute place, and it's worth making the trip for the tableside guacamole if you're in or near New York New York."

I ordered the vegetable fajitas, and the mixed vegetables were a mixture of excellent and undercooked. The standard cherry tomatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini were superbly cooked, but the dish also contained some hard, chewy greens that offset that pleasantness. The flour tortillas on the side were not edible.. I believe they did not steam them, so they were sort of... tough. And thick. \n\nAs for the sides, you get your standard rice and beans. I opted for the cilantro rice and refried beans (topped with cheddar cheese, do not expect cojita) which were fine enough. \n\nThe service was friendly, and the food arrived promptly. \n\nThe bottom line: If you're in a pinch, it's better than opting for the food court and probably wont cost you much more. Go elsewhere if you're looking to eat well, because this place seems to be fairly hit-or-miss in terms of quality."

Oddly enough, no salsa?\n* Chicken Tortilla Soup.\n* Oven-Roasted Broccoflower Soup with Green Chile Puree and Sweet Corn Dumpling.\n* Chili-Lime Chicken Fajitas.\n* Combo - chili rellenos, chicken tamale, barbacoa burrito.\n\nWe really weren't impressed with the food here at all. It started out good though. We both enjoyed the salsas that were brought to the table. The broccoflower soup was a little watery but had great flavor. Everything else was terrible. The chicken tortilla soup was bland. The entrees took far too long and were definitely not worth the wait. The chile lime chicken fajitas tasted like store brought chicken strips. They were pretty much flavorless, with no tasteable chile or lime anywhere. The sauteed peppers were the best thing on the plate. The combo plate was buried in sour cream. It looked bad and tasted bad. The tamale was dry and flavorless, the chili rellenos were soggy and the barbacoa was dry. \n\nNot to mention that there was some emergency light flashing over our head for half the meal, and the constant slot machine sounds. If I ever return to Vegas, I won't be making a stop in here."

It was a little hard to find - it's located on one of the \"side streets\" that branch off the casino floor.  Don't be afraid to ask someone to point you in the right direction.\n\nMost of the food was good, but the salsa was too hot for my taste.  I asked whether they had a milder salsa, and my server looked at me like I had asked whether they had puppies on the menu.  Unfortunately, my enchilada/burrito combination plate was drenched with the salsa, which made the whole meal unpleasant.  Unless your tastes run to pretty hot food, ask them to hold the salsa, and order a side of guacamole for the chips.  (Both the chips and the guac were good, but not great).\n\nThe ambiance was, of course, faux New York side street.  The roller coaster ran overhead; fortunately, they manage to make it a lot less noisy when it runs through the casino than when it runs outside the building.\n\nThe selection of margaritas is excellent, if a bit pricey.  Most of them run $15 and up, which is more than most entrees on the menu.  Since I am not a margarita connoisseur, I ordered the happy hour house margarita for $5, and it was fine.\n\nThe service was quick, but it would have helped if our server spoke better English, or even Spanish.  (I think her first language originated somewhere in East Asia, but it was hard to tell.)  My wife asked a few questions, and it seems that the server's approach to answering was \"Just Say No,\" which might be fine for drugs but was not very helpful if you're trying to make a substitution on the menu.  Who knows; maybe you won't be able to get them to hold the salsa."

I ordered the carnitas tacos and he had enchiladas. I for one loved the food. My tacos were served with big portions of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream on the side for me to put on my tacos. The rice and beans were good too. My husband said he also enjoyed his enchiladas. The prices were comparable to portions that you get which was also nice to find in Vegas. Our waiter was also attentive and checked on us often throughout the meal. Then something happened, he just brought us the check without offering dessert which we wanted and we had to let him know. He seemed annoyed by that for some reason. For dessert I ordered flan any my husband ordered the fried icecream and we both really enjoyed the dessert. The flan was made from scratch instead of coming from a box which you do get in alot of Mexican restaurants. I love flan and I consider myself somewhat of an expert. LOL. Then our waiter disappears and we end up waiting forever for the check which is one of my pet peeves when I go to restaurant. He was so quick to bring it before no he is nowhere to be found. Then he finally brings us the check some 15minutes later and we stick our card in there and then again he pulls his disappearing act. It was at least another 15 minutes that went by making paying for our a meal a 30 minute ordeal, then he reappears again and he is socializing with his co-workers instead of collecting the check. The quickest way to piss me off in a hurry is to keep to me waiting too long for something that should not take long in the first place. Our food was settled and we were hungry by the time he decided to grace us with his presence. I was amazed at how quick he changed after the dessert incident. He went from being a great server to being a real jerk and for that I deduct two stars. This could have easily been a 5 star experience had our waiter not been bi-polar. I still recommend the place for their food but maybe you should make sure they know you want dessert in advance."

I was in Vegas for my job and my co-workers wanted Mexican food. Vegas usually isn't where I come for Mexican but I'd eaten at Gonzalez y Gonzalez before so I recommended it. We were sat quickly and our guy Hector was quick with the chips & salsa. I really like the salsa here. It has a roasted flavor which I've yet to find anywhere else. I usually roll with the wet burrito but I was in a nacho mood that day so the Gonzalez Nachos it was ($10.95). Really good. Melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and shredded chicken it was definitely a meal's worth of food. My coworkers went with a couple of enchilada plates and a street taco plate. Everyone liked everything they got (whew!). Service was friendly and the food came out fast. Hector had to separate tickets a couple ways (four tickets for food, two additional for alcoholic beverages) and he did it with no issues. While there's no doubt you could find better Mexican food in Vegas if you don't want to fight traffic leaving the Strip you could do much worse. Food comes out fast, service is friendly and prices (for Vegas) are pretty reasonable."

Our bartender Oscar was great and fun. We also had guacamole with chips. I love that they have a cart come around to make it fresh in front of you! It also allows for you to customize what you want in the guacamole. It also comes with this fresh mild salsa that was delicious. Menu looked like it had a lot of options, would check it out another time for lunch. The food smelled amazing!"

Just a FYI for your staff just because a family looks young and maybe doesn't seem like they could afford to eat there seeing as thats the vibe we got the WHOLE time doesn't mean they should be treated badly. If people are at your asstablisment they are obvously there to spend money and eat and they should be treated with respect! Very disappointed."

Located in NYNY, it is fairly close to the Monte Carlo which was where we were staying over the weekend. There was no wait to be seated for a party of 5 on a Saturday early-ish afternoon. We were seated and greeted by our waiter who offered us chips and salsa (not on the house!) as well as some of their many tequilas that they offer. I mean, seriously! they have a good range of different tequilas from the usual Patron Silver under their blanco and silver menu that also includes Jose Cuervo Platino and Don Julio Blanco, they also have Cuervo tradicional and 1800 reposado under the reposado menus, and they also have abocado, muy anejo tequilas and regular anejo. Super awesome if you are a tequila fan. Of course they also have their margaritas, beers, and even wine. \n\nThe husband and I wanted to try to eat something else other than Mexican food for dinner so we only ordered an appetizer to share. We ordered the chicken empanadas which were ok. Crispy, flaky and soft with a good amount of chicken in them. I thought they were a bit on the oily side but then again, I guess it is fried food. My brother ordered the carne asada tacos which I took a bite off and were alright. At $15.95 though, I thought they would be a tad bit better. The meat was a bit on the bland side but if I had enough salsa on them, it was better. \n\nService was ok. We did get our waters refilled  and our waiter came once to check up on us."

On Saturday, April 27, 2013 she and all over her staff front and back were absolutely amazing and worked with us immensely on short short notice. \n\nThe back story: \nWe had just finished up with a wedding and the Bride (my cousin) decided she wanted the entire bridal party and all the guests to meet at Gonzalez's in New York New York for a celebratory dinner. Mind you this was NOT preplanned so we did not have a reservation and had a party over 20+ headed that way. My girlfriend and I were one of the first ones there and took it upon ourselves to get a reservation in. We were extremely worried with the amount of people expected that we would not be able to all be seated at one time. The hostess was unable to book a reservation of that size on short notice without the G.M's approval...so we spoke with Mary. Mary was amazing (I couldn't say it enough). She and her staff cleared out the left side of the restaurant as the guests left and \"reserved\" the tables for our party. They were able to pull a table together for the entire party and saved some seats along the outside of the table for any stragglers. \n\nThey we're more than accommodating with our needs and even with a party of our size the service was great. Each person we encountered was happy and smiled and was willing to help service our needs. The food was prompt (a little slower than normal, but nothing outrageous taking in our groups size and short notice).\n\nNeedless to say the Bride and Groom and everyone who came were extremely please with the attention Gonzalez's staff gave all of us, the food, and the experience in general. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I will make it a point to stop back in and have another Beer-A-Rida (or three) and the yummy chips and salsa! \n\nThanks again Mary - you guys were truly life savers!!"

We ordered steak nachos, pozole, shrimp ceviche, tortilla soup, and a chimichanga. We all left very satisfied and had no complaints about the food. I will definitely go back next time i'm in Vegas."

We kept returning with our glass to get discounted refills. It was pretty awesome. The downside is they won't mix flavors for you. Also, after the 3rd one you start to crave other booze.\n\nNow for dinner: Our waiter was very efficient. The chips and yummy salsa arrived on our table immediately after being seated.

I had the carne asada tacos and I can honestly say I have never had asada that tender before it was very good. The Spanish rice and beans were good and their guacamole is excellent.

Sadly, it was downhill from there on in.\n\nThe biggest complaint, from the whole group, was how salty all the food was. My experience was of very ordinary diner food served with little real care.

So having a Steak dinner was not going to happen and room service was only ordered once :( \nBut lucky for us we were meeting some friends at the dueling piano bar and had some time for some grub so we stopped over at Gonzales Y Gonzalez and man am I glad we did. They greeting us with a warm basket of chips and offered their margarita which sounded and tasted so good! As always I ordered the Carnitas tacos which I have always ordered from all mexican restaurants that are put to the test and they passed with flying colors. The tacos were a perfect size their beans and rice tasted authentic and the price was oh so right! I don't know about you but I get so excited when I get a cheap bill. I dont know how many times we have gotten a big bill that was so over priced and made me mad. You have to pay no matter what but sometimes it just sucks. We ate here twice during our trip and didnt even feel guilty about not going to try something new, it was like why \"try\" something else when we have a sure thing...I guess I wasn't into experimenting that weekend. I will definitely go back next time I am in town."

The cilantro rice is really tasty. My husband had a chili relleno, chicken enchilada, and a tamale. He chose the black beans and Mexican rice and they were good too, but I liked the cilantro rice and refried beans best. The portions were big and we left stuffed. Absolutely a great place.

Our waiter, Chris was awesome. He was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu items. After we placed our order he gave each of us a detailed description of what we ordered and how the food would be served.  We were really impressed with the level of service Chris provided.  He was genuinely nice and friendly.\n\nFood: The food exceeded my expectations. We started with chips and salsa, which were very good. The chips were crispy, fresh, and warm; and the salsa was very flavorful and spicy, but not too hot. Note, the chips and salsa are not free, but definitely worth the $3.00. \nI ordered the Chimichanga with shredded beef (pictured below). The chimichanga was STUFFED with shredded beef and the flour tortilla was fried to perfection. Considering the outside is fried, it was not overly greasy. The shredded beef was full of flavor; a bit on the spicy side but delicious if you like spicy food. I personally could not get enough. It was topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and shredded cheese. It came with a side of pinto beans and rice. The beans had lots of flavor and were topped with a bit of crumbled queso fresco. The rice was cooked well but had a lemony flavor which I didn't care for much.\nMy husband ordered a 3 item plate with a taco, enchilada, and burrito. It came with a side of refried beans and rice. The taco was made of carnitas, the enchilada was chicken, and the burrito was ground beef. FYI, you have the option to choose different types of meats. My husband said the carnitas had lots of flavor and were really good. They were cooked well and not greasy. The only thing he did not care for much was the carnitas were served in chunks rather than shredded. I think it's more of a personal preference. The ground beef burrito and chicken enchilada were also good. He agreed that the rice had a lemony taste but said it was good and didn't mind it.\n\nValue: Prices were reasonable and comparable to other restaurants. We spent about $47.00 for chips & salsa, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks. The food was definitely worth it; very flavorful & filling.\n\nI would definitely recommend eating here and cannot wait to go back."

Finally, a Mexican restaurant on the Strip with great food and not for $20 for 2 tacos. \n\nEven though the steak in my fajitas weren't stellar, I still really enjoyed my meal.

My other half ordered the Arrachera (pretty much like carne asada) which was freaking amazing. The meat was perfectly cooked and tender with BIG flavor. Was kinda jealous that he ordered that! My steak was nowhere near as good as his. \n\nLots of different kind of margaritas. We had the El Choco Loco, and it was fantastic! IT HAD MALBIU IN IT!\n\nThe downside... Our server was... weird. He would come to our table and not saying anything. He just stood there waiting for US to say something. Uh. But it looked like the servers around us were decent, so maybe we got the sour one out of the bunch. \n\nAlso, no complimentary chips and salsa. Meh.

The menu has an excellent variety of Mexican food and the pricing is excellent for anyone on a budget.

I would go back on my next visit to Vegas. The first time I went to this place was for the Latin dancing on a Saturday night about six months ago. On our most recent trip last week we decided to give the food a try while visiting NY-NY."

I went with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and most were satisfied but 2 hated the place, mostly because their food was cold. I got chicken fajitas and they were ok, comparable to a chilis or 99 restaurant unfortunately. Salsa alone would bring me back though"

Perhaps Mexican food is in my comfort zone, but as I strolled through New York-New York around dinner time, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez sounded very appetizing.\n\nIt's a small restaurant, with many tables outnumber the few booths. Our waitress was below average to everyone she was serving, though my party and I noted that the other waiters seemed more attentive. The bar served 48 oz frozen margaritas, which could be seen on many of the dining tables. It's also good to note that there is a wide selection of tequila and margaritas offered.\n\nLike many Mexican restaurants (at least in California), chips and salsa were presented as starters. The salsa was amazing, with the chips not lacking either. I ordered a chicken enchilada and chicken burrito two item combo, along with a mojito. The mojito was delicious; the drink was almost green from the mint. Both the enchilada and burrito did not disappoint, either. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the sauces covering each item were delicious. The beans were tasty, but the rice was not good. It tasted like the microwavable kind. \n\nOverall, the food was very good, and well-priced. I was surprised to find it comparable to the great Mexican-American food chains found in California."

At first I had ordered the steak nachos but our waitress was quick to point out that the portion was really small and it was more of an appetizer. I truly appreciated her honesty. I ended up ordering the chicken quesadilla which came with pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole. The shredded chicken was very tasty however I was quite disappointed by how small the quesadilla was. My friend ordered the Gonzalez nachos which consists of nacho, cheese, ground beef and guacamole. I was able to try some of it and it was good.\n\nWhile my experience at this restaurant was very positive, I thought the restaurant was a bit pricey for the amount of food served (both our bills added up to $26). If you are really craving or wanting to eat Mexican food while vacationing in Las Vegas, I suggest you look for a place away from the strip."

The food was good, but it was pretty standard Mexican (not that that's a bad thing); not particularly creative but nevertheless a good, decently-priced fish taco with good service. Since we were heading to the concert, we opted for their oversized margarita (the 48oz. behemoth) for the road. For $20, it's hard to beat considering we were paying $8-10 a pop for margaritas elsewhere. All around, good Mexican and perfect for a casual bite."

It did turn out to be a very expensive meal anyhow but I will admit that is mostly due to our need to buy many delicious margaritas and someone else's need to get souvenir cups. Be forewarned though my most delicious margarita was 16$ and so tasty I had to have two. It did come with a very unique lemon lime salt on the rim that kept me perplexed the entire time. My server was also kind enough to bring us to go cups when we were finished eating and not quite finished our drinks which is something I truly love about Vegas. Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meals, but disappointed that this place charged extra for chips and salsa causing us to go without. I had the tableside guacamole as an appetizer which was pretty big and I was unable to finish it. It was reasonable at 9$ and made the same as at other similar places which offer this, consisted of 1 and a half avocados, cilantro, jalepenos, lime, etc. and a huge basket of chips. Others seemed happy sharing a meal of fajitas and were delighted to be given extra tortillas. Service was okay, but did seem like we ended up spending a lot of time here. My favorite part is being able to look through the \"windows\" and see the New York decor on the \"buildings\" nearby."

The salsa was nothing to write home about, but neither was it bland and they also gave me plenty of it. My margarita was excellent, neither too stiff nor watered down; expertly made and delicious. The fajitas were always going to be the kicker in this deal though. Even in Austin I'm picky about fajitas, but outside of Texas I rarely find any I like. These fajitas, I liked. They weren't burnt, the marinade on the chicken wasn't overpowering or non-existent, and they tasted like fajitas are supposed to taste. Also the fajitas came with 4 tortillas! I thought fajitas only ever came with 3.

I'm giving it 2 stars only because it was ok & not disgusting. I was there a couple wks ago for the 1st time & was dissapointed :-( I had cheese enchiladas wth rice & beans. Let's start wth the enchiladas, the sauce was ok, I think they use las palmas canned salsa, which is definitely not 5 stars. The rice seemed to come from a pouch that reads \"spanish rice\" and the beans were merely edible. I don't c the hype about this place at all. Also, the service sucks!!! I wanted to sit wth my frnds at a little side table next to the restaurant so the hostess told me to order my food to go frm the bar. I walked over & waited while the bar waitress chit chatted wth a couple of guys. The heffer completely ignored me 4 a few mins till I waved at her. She clearly saw me but didn't want to be bothered while she flirted wth the guys. Anyway, its way overpriced (mine was compd wth my mlife points luckily), food sucks & the portions are actually small. Don't eat here! Instead go to a buffet, they have better mexican food there & u get what u pay for."

We went to New York New York to pick up our show tickets, decided to eat at Gonzalez, we had drinks there last time, it was good, I figured the food should be good too. Turned out I was so right! Delicious large portioned Mexican food, so yummy! \n\nI ordered a huge frozen mango margarita, it was fairly strong, but a little too sweet like all frozen drinks here in Vegas. Loved their salsa, so spicy! Just what I needed, chips & salsa are not free, it's $2.50. \n\nI ordered tableside crab guacamole to start, it came with flat bread and chips, so fresh, spicy and flavorful! A huge bowl that could easily feed up to 4 people, we couldn't finish it all of course! \n\nHubby had a soup to start, he said that soup was for hangover, I wanted to try some, but I saw pork in there, no... So I just had the diced tomatoes and lettuce that came with it. \n\nI had grilled fish taco as entree, 3 small tacos with guacamole, radish, beans and rice: the fish was very tender and flavorful, so delicious. \n\nHubby had steak fajita: the steak cooked perfectly to medium close to rare, tender, yummy with enough flavors, I loved the beans and rice came with it, hubby loved the tortilla! \n\nOf course I had to have desert, ordered fried ice cream, it was a bomb, a huge bomb! The cinnamon sugar bowl was so crispy and sweet! A great sugar fix! \n\nLoved the decor and ambience of this place, very relaxing and chill, we got seated outside the main restaurant, it was better than sitting inside, we took our time to enjoy our big comfort meal, it was fun! Our server was very attentive and polite, we asked how was business, he said it was the busiest day of the entire week? I was surprised! Why, I love the food and service here, and the tab was only $85, much more cheaper than other restaurants in Vegas! Well, I plan to come back anyways! \n\nA great place for margaritas and big comfor Mexican meals! \n\nGreat late lunch, I was sooo full, but very satisfied!"

Nothing was too overwhelming and I found myself digging in despite my pretty full stomach. It was huge and great to share among the 3 of us. Not only were the various toppings really fresh, plentiful, yet not too heavy, but the chips themselves were really delicious. \n\nEl Grande Helado is basically a giant ball of dense and creamy vanilla ice cream deep fried in a flaky cinnamon shell served with deep fried cinnamon pita strips.... It's death but SO unregretfully amazing.. My parents don't have much of a sweet tooth so I ate basically the whole damn thing. I normally don't like fried ice cream because the fried shell distracts from the ice cream, but in this case, the shell was thin and flaky like cereal and offered great texture to the dish! And of course, how can fried cinnamon strips with vanilla ice cream not be amazing....\n\nThese two dishes were the best things I ate at Vegas, and I've been trying tons of places! I don't know how the rest of the food here is, but definitely come in if you wanna try the appetizers and desserts. :)"

There was a Raider/Saints preseason game on TV, and we my chick and I sat at the bar. Wanted to sit down, have a beer, watch the game and relax. Especially after the 3 and a half hour drive over here. The bartender who took our orders, I think her name was Heather, she was a real Cool chick. She was from Denver and told us how much of a Broncos fan she was. I Love It when a chick knows her shit about football! Actually kind of a turn-on.......\n\nAny-who, LOL.\n          I ordered a Negro Modelo, and my chick had a Mango Margarita. They use Patron Silver, which gained some points from me. Bartender actually gave us an extra one for free. Which I gladly drank. Our appetizer we shared a chicken tortilla soup, its been a while since I had a bowl of this stuff, and I was shocked on how tasty this soup was, We both agreed that this soup was very flavorful. Highly recommed this soup if your looking for a lil snack. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Barbacoa Chimichanga. Very good flavor, meat was perfect, came with rice & beans and some guacamole. My chick had the three tacos, two beef & one chicken. Nothing amazing about them from what she said. \n\nNothing negative to say about this place. Food was good, not too expensive (Mexican Food should never be expensive), the people passing by streets that look like New York is Awesome, but the thing that impressed me the most by this place was the service. Of course the bartender was cool, but everyone else that worked there was just as cool & hard working. The gentleman who brought us our food was polite and you can tell this guy works his ass off for this place. From asking for more limes for our margarita to the sour cream for my Chimi, this places service was what I'll remember from here at New York-New York."

It is a must-do on my list every time I go to Vegas.\n\nGood Mexican food, great chips and salsa, good margaritas, great sizzling fajitas, and nice pozole soup. It is easy to get to (NY NY food area) and the staff has always been great.\n\nHighly recommend if you're a fan of the food style!"

We found ourselves here later in the evening and instead of being, \"well, what do you want?\"  \"No, what do you want?\"  We decided upon this place \"just because\" and of all the places we ate at, w/the exception of the Victorian Cafe at the old Barbary Coast, this was the most unimpressive of all our meals.  \n\nThe food here is atypical of any \"tex/mex\" eatery, as in On the Border or Jose Teja's, but I didn't leave here with my clothes and hair smelling of the place, so that bumps it up a star, and being in close proximity to a toilet doesn't hurt, either. \n\nYou will leave here with a burrito hangover, I assure you, if that's what you are looking for - so uninspiring, I almost forgot I ate here."

The marination of mushroom with chillelime had a very strong pungent flavor. They charged us for the chips and salsa which we thought   was complementary and was not informed that it wasn't for free! Salsa tasted like a store bought one. I wish I had tried any other restaurants near by!"

I showed up before they opened and chatted with a server and then the manager. Both were incredibly helpful and had everything set up perfectly for our wedding party. I honestly couldn't have been happier! The food was great and the prices were better than anywhere else."

The entree nachos were amazing and were individual chips piled with lots chicken cheese and guac, my favorite. The nachos on the appetizer menu were just a pile of nachos with TONS of toppings, we actually had toppings left over with no chips to put them on!"

Maybe it's because visitors to Las Vegas who stay at the New York, New York don't \"get\" what pozole is.\n\nSo.\nThere's tortilla soup instead.\n\nBut I'm not sooo disappointed because each time I've come here the staff has been friendly and efficient. The food is basic mexican but it's done consistently well. The tilapia tacos were seasoned enough to please me and also my 2 year old. The enchiladas and tacos were simple and tasty. Chips were light and the salsa smokey and spicy.\n\nIt's kid friendly and good for big groups. You're not going to get anything out of the ordinary here but you don't have to leave the Strip to get decent Mexican food."

Carrots and peas in the \"Spanish\" rice...really?\nBurrito was bland and not Mexican! I want to see its papers! \n\nIf you have a jones for Mexican in Vegas, wait til you get to California. If you're looking for a good place to eat on the strip, find somewhere else! \n\nWhile you're sitting on the patio or in the restaurant trying to eat your meal, you're reminded that NYNY built a rollercoaster through the hotel/food area. So every 10 min a group of SCREAMING youngsters go by. Happy digesting on that one."

I don't know if it was because it was off season or the bartender was quitting or something, but he made our yard margaritas with GOOD tequila. It wasn't just a dash, either. He used one bottle to make both our drinks. Yes, ladies and gents, I was walking around Vegas with half a bottle of tequila in January. Happy times, happy times. The guacamole was good, the chips were salty. Just like a pre-tequila fest should be. Don't remember the food too much...probably worth noting that it wasn't memorable.\nSeriously. Get that drink. You won't need to order anything else during that night. It's something magical."
