            "review": "Visited for Dinner before going to the Smith Center for a show with freinds and there were 3 kids in our party about 8 years old.  This is not a kid freindly place.  We asked the waiter for guidance on ordering for the kids and he just said we don't have a kids menu.  So, what are we suppose to do, just get up an leave?  We finally got some help with what the kids could eat but what he proposed was not kid friendly. One item was deep fried to long and was so hard it could not be eaten by kids.  They also charged $12 each for thin, 6 inch round casadias.  Kids left hungery and the waiter was just not very freindly.  He acted too big time to help us and smile.\n\nThe adult meals were good and beer was a good price.  Manager was nice and adjusted the bill, but if you have to get to know the manager, it was probably not a good night out or a good dining experience.   Prices were kinda high for dinner for mexican food, in the 20 to 30 dollar range but I liked my meal and it is close to the Smith Center so no worries on the adult meal prices.  \n\nI would go back for lunch but maybe not for dinner and never again with kids."

I had the filet chili rellano that has a great smokey flavor. The risotto was really delicious! The avocado crusted scallops was cooked to perfection. Everything was clean and beautiful inside and outside!"

I am not sure if they still do breakfast either, but if I am in area, will give them a shot for lunch"

The salsa had good flavor but wasn't quite spicy enough for either of us. We both ordered the sangria and I would highly recommend it.  \n\nWe're both alike and we can never decide on one thing. Since she's a vegetarian, I decided to go with a veggie entree so we could both try two different items. She ordered the garden quesadilla and I ordered the garden enchiladas. Both entrees were pretty good!  I would definitely like to go back and try one of their meat entrees though. They also have a brunch menu that sounds amazing. I will definitely be back sometime to give it another try."

Of course it is in the World Market Design Center~\n    Warmly greeted with warm tortilla chips sprinkled with cumin and a slightly spicy roasted salsa~ ordered fresh made guacamole, simply deelish!\n  I had the brisket red & green enchiladas... OMG, just the BEST! My husband had the Sea Bass  tacos which were also VERY GOOD!\n    Wonderful service I think we had 4 different service people.

            "review": "Went here today as a spur of the moment yelp spot.   Was looking for something around Charleston and the I-15 area and lo and behold i found this place.\n\nMy first impression was how fancy the place was.  You're ok if you dress casual but you'd feel a lot more comfortable if you wore something a little more dressy.  Like a button up or something of that nature. I walked in with a T-Shirt and jeans thinking it was a casual restaurant and was surprisingly mistaken.\n\nAmbiance is Very classy romantic.  Would be a good place to get to be able to talk and get to know a date.  They have unique chandeliers hanging from the ceilings and a wall of dim lights that gives it that romantic feel\n\nService was great and very accommodating.  For the ladies the waiter would place the napkin on the ladies lap and all that fancy jazz.  While i can learn to love the feeling i know the ladies felt funny about it knowing we were feeling underdressed.  They were very prompt on refilling drinks and making sure we were very comfy.\n\nFood was delicious.  I ordered the shrimp diablo.  It was filling, packed with flavor and heat (as something with the word diablo in the name should!)   The rice it was served with i felt accompanied the dish very well. My friend ordered the Sea scallops with the mango relish and was in love with that as well.  We all felt full but not quite full where we were uncomfortable.  So it was justly sized portions.\n\nPrice of the place is on the high end of the $$.  Typically entree's ranged from 20- 40$ \n\nOverall i liked the place a lot and would consider a date here if i'm on that side of town.  Maybe a nice stop to fill up before first friday or something."

At first glance it looked like the place was expensive, and probably not going to be worth it, i was PROVED WRONG when they had a decently priced happy hour. I believe we spent 60 bucks for three people and came out satisfied. The food had great flavor(calamari, beef sticks, nachos, tacos, etc etc)\n\nI WILL eat here again when I'm back in town."

            "review": "As the only Yelper in my group, I've gotten used to the pressure of \"Steph, find us a good place to go.\" In this case we were in Vegas, where the options are endless! The group consensus was that they wanted Mexican food, but higher end (and I wanted a cocktail!!!)\n\nFound Mundo, and got there at 6:50 pm (Happy hour ended at 7 pm.) I was stoked to make it, because they had 1/2 off appetizers and drink specials. We weren't sitting in the bar, though, and I was told happy hour was just for bar patrons. We couldn't move because we had an infant with us....I guess I looked sad, because suddenly our server changed his mind and allowed us the special pricing. Yay! \n\nOur party of 4 had a variety of different appetizers, including chicken \"taquitos\" that were street tacos of the most gourmet varierty. Their calamari appetizer is NOT TO BE MISSED. Next time I go to Vegas I want an order of that all to myself. For an entree, my boyfriend and I shared the filet mignon chile rilleno, and that (along with guacamole, calamari, and bites of the chicken street tacos) was more than enough food. \n\nThe margaritas were fabulous, and on special during happy hour. I think their house margaritas are $3 or $4 dollars. Very fresh, and did not give me heartburn, so I think the mix was homemade. Delish! \n\nThey have an accoustic guitarist play every night, and on this particular night he was playing everything from Frank Sinatra to John Meyer. It was the perfect noise level, loud enough that it was enjoyable, but not so loud that you couldn't hear your friends talk across the table. My perfect decibel level. I think the biggest fan of our group was my 18 month old niece, who was swaying to the music the whole time. \n\nOverall, we loved the ambience, the service, the quality of the food, and the cocktails. Yelp--you came through yet again. We will definitely be back to this hidden gem."

            "review": "Mundo is one of those places you want to keep a secret because it's just so perfect that you're worried it will change if it becomes really big.  The eastern inspired decor and the dim (but not too dim) lighting set the stage as soon as you walk in.  The magic continues with the food.  Chips with three different types of salsas take the place of the standard dinner rolls and my friend and I took dipping turns to determine our favorite of the three (it was difficult because all 3 really hit the mark!)  I also highly recommend the sangria, which is served perfectly chilled.  \n\nFor dinner, I took our server's suggestion of the Shrimp Tamale, while my friend decided on their Pollo Rostisado (Chicken in Tamarind Sauce) -- both were excellent!  I asked them to spice the shrimp up a bit and it came out perfectly -- not too spicy but just spicy enough -- which was a perfect compliment to the slightly sweet tamale.  \n\nDespite some folks' experience, we found service to be excellent.   Our server was only too happy to answer our questions about the menu, make suggestions and check up on us to make sure things were okay.   And, even though we closed down the resto on a random weeknight, the service folks were only smiling and asking us to \"Come again soon.\"  I heart Mundo and cannot wait for my next visit."

I'm so happy we did because the food is pretty amazing. It's not your typical Mexican restaurant. All the dishes had a unique twist to it. The sauces on the dishes were so good. They also give you complimentary chips and salsa.  The entrees however do not come with sides like rice or beans. You have to order that separate. \nMake sure to check in so you can get 10% off one entree per table!!"

I didn't have dinner here (although I did have the chance, I just had other plans) but I did have food here. \n\nLet me start over. Walking into this place, the first thing that struck me was the lighting. The lanterns are gorgeous - absolutely stunning. The place should be gorgeous, with all the designers just mere inches away from the restaurant. I digress. \n\nIt's a Mexican restaurant, but it feels intimate, not cheesy or stuffy. The lights are down low, and the furniture is gorgeous. It's a classic hacienda styled interior and it works. Love it. (Can you tell?)\n\nAs we all went back to a more private, sectioned off room, we were treated to various appetizers - steak tacos, chips and salsa, chicken quesadillas, etc. Bar none, the quesadillas were the best thing I tasted, but everything was delicious.\n\nI had a sangria from the bar - can you believe it? $5! Maybe I'm just used to menus with $20 Redbulls on the Strip, so $5 feels like a steal. I've had better Sangria, but this wasn't a bad choice at all. I must add that the waitstaff was perfectly good the entire reception. \n\nHopefully I can try the entrees and bump up my ratings. \nGood service + Good Location + Great Food = I will be back!"

            "review": "Five stars for two reasons:  (1) The food is absolutely amazing; (2) it is not typically Vegas.  Mundo is not in a huge resort property, and it isn't in a strip mall.  Vegas is so commercialized that it is difficult to find a unique place with great tasting food.  Mundo provides both.\n\nWe started with the ahi tuna tostada and the queso flamaedo (only because I'm a sucker for anything containing the word \"cheese\" no matter the language.)  The ahi tuna tostada was to die for.  Seriously.  Flavor was great and it was not too filling so it won't ruin your dinner.  The queso was good, don't get me wrong, but it was what is says it is: a big bowl of chewy melted cheese.  Next time we'll try the calamari, but we're getting that ahi tosatada again for sure.\n\nFor dinner, we shared the Mundo chopped salad and filet mignon chile relleno.  I usually would NEVER order a chile relleno because I don't like hot stuff, but the waitress assured me that is wasn't too spicy, and she was right.  Holy cow.  Smoky sauce balanced with goat cheese, tender pieces of filed mignon....I was in heaven.  If you don't like hot things, don't get greedy and eat the pepper up to the stem, because it does get warm up there.\n\nNo dessert for us, but we had 2 margaritas.  I don't drink margaritas often, so they seemed sour, but I'm pretty sure it was just me.  This was a Saturday night, it was about 50% full, and our total bill was $100 with tip.  This is a Vegas jewel and you can bet we'll be back!"

            "review": "You can forgive a lot when food is this tasty, and Mundo doesn't need much forgiving but it does need some. Self-identifying as \"chic\" for starters. I don't even know what \"chic\" is, but it sure doesn't enhance the restaurant's allure and actually makes it seem silly and precious. Maybe \"chic\" is how you get away with charging twenty four dollars for carnitas tacos and twenty six for shrimp tamales. Those are Topolobampo prices, and Mundo is very good but Mundo is no Topolobampo. It's hard to fuss when you taste the food, though, and the food was delicious from jump street. I never thought I would utter the words \"best chips and salsa of all time,\" but there you go. They arrive at your table swiftly upon being seated, a generous plate of chips dusted with a dark chili powder of some kind. It was subtle but gave the chips a lovely warmth and depth that perfectly accompanied the complexly flavored salsa. I detected smoke, sweetness, tartness, and a just a bit of heat in the salsa--it was remarkable, a true marvel of salsa engineering. Swoon-inducing. I wanted to rise and slow-clap to a Snow Patrol song.  \n\nThe idea being to share everything, we ordered the ahi tuna tostada for starters, the carnitas with a side of sauteed spinach for the entree and a side of their \"risotto.\" Alas, they were out of carnitas! Visibly crushed and deflated, we went with the skirt steak instead. Perhaps because of my histrionics, or perhaps because my dining companion had mentioned that she wanted to say hi to her friend George, the owner, or perhaps she's just that thoughtful--our waitress came back a few minutes later saying the kitchen had *just* enough carnitas left for one taco and brought it to us gratis. And oh, such carnitas. As with the salsa, itsflavor profile is astonishing; assertive but layered. First you get smoke from a grill, then comes a combination of sweetness and a bit of kick, with a long lingering finish. The meat is succulent and perfectly balanced. Slow-clap number two for the bonus carnitas taco. At this point Mundo could have slept with my best friend and I'd still take her back.  \n\nNot much to say about the tostada, however, which was a tad one-note. The tortilla was dense and the \"sushi grade\" tuna was rather of the all-you-can-eat variety--heavy and even chewy. There was a nice bit of heat at the end, but it was sort of too-little too-late. Not a terrible dish, but the weakest of the meal. \n\nThe skirt steak re-confirmed what the salsa and carnitas had promised. It was grilled to a perfect medium-rare as requested, and sliced against the grain at a severe angle which shows the chef knows whats up. Most impressive of all was the rub, a crusty black bark of infinite spice. Entire worlds of dark, tragically beautiful flavor are packed into that crust. That crust is like the black obelisk in 2001: A Space Odyssey, containing all of humanity's dread and limitless potential at once. It was the single greatest taste experience of the meal. My only gripe with the steak is that they make a fuss about using \"wagyu.\" Anyone can buy skirt steak for about seven bucks a pop and achieve the same level of juicy tenderness. Skirt steak is a heroic cut that aims to please. One doesn't need \"wagyu,\" which promises greater levels of tenderness and fat, because skirt steak is already perfectly tender and no one could detect the marbling underneath all those enormous flavors in the rub and the chimichurri and \"marinated avocados\" (?). This was Mundo being chic, I fear, using the word \"wagyu\" as a way to charge penthouse prices for a street-level cut. \n\nWe were excited to have the \"risotto\" along with the steak, but some wires got crossed and it didn't come. I mentioned to our lovely server how excited I was to try the risotto and it arrived a few minutes later in what looked like a small soup bowl. At that point the meal was almost finished, and while the risotto did harmonize nicely with the steak it was just too heavy to get through. The flavors were splendid, once again, but the dish needs to be dialed way down. It's overkill; the texture is heavy and the flavors don't sing they scream. Because it was neglected, our waitress said the dish was \"on her.\" Another nice move on her part. \n\nThe location of this restaurant, at the base of a building the size of a small planet, is an atrocity of convenience. I've lived downtown for two years and this was my first visit. And the \"chic\" factor can seriously grate, as certain flourishes (like \"wagyu\") are unnecessary and distracting, and costly. But Mundo packs some of the most exciting flavors I've come across in a good while, enough so that I'll likely suck it up and pay the inflated prices because it's a party in your mouth, people, and no one's calling the cops."

We have tried a few things, but these are the best. The skirt steak has great flavor, and the mexican corn is so creamy and lime with just enough cilantro (which I hate) to be perfect.  The flavor on both of these dishes is outstanding.\n\nNow the reason for 3 stars and not 4.  If you order 2 of those skirt steakd dinners with 4 margaritas and you are over $100 without tip, so set expectations accordingly.  Mundo is 4 star on flavor, but I gave them 3 stars as they are just a bit pricey.  Maybe if drinks were less it would be enough to get the bill down and i would have no reservations on a 4 star rating."

Don't forget the extensive Spanish/Mexican inspired Wine list. \n\nAppetizer: 5/5\nSince your given complimentary tortilla chips and salsa, It was a given duh that we'd order GUACAMOLE. I'm a sucker for guacamole, super fresh and creamy.*\n\nWine: 5/5\nWine from around the world, I chose Casillero del diablo, merlot 2008, from chile. Thought hmmm Spanish inspired Chile wines a must. Smooth and refreshing, with a little bite. The color was a dark ruby red. \n\nVegan Entree: 5/5\nI appreciate restaurants that appreciate their Vegan customers. So when I noticed they offered Vegan entree's I couldn't resist being a Vegan for one night. I ordered the garden quesadilla with manchego and oaxaca cheese, 3 bean relish, green chile pipian drizzle. This was surprisingly super yummy. The pop of hot spices and fresh ingredients YUMM."

The decor, dishes, and service (and price) are all a step-up in quality from a normal Mexican joint, yet it is still approachable. Yeah, you might feel a little out of place in a raggy t-shirt and jeans that a mom-n-pop joint would gladly welcome, but it is not overly stylish and cold, it just has a bit of modern flare. I have been to this place about a dozen times and have been satisfied each time. However, it should be noted that about a third of those times I have ordered the sea bass tacos, so menu diversification is not a strong point. But let that be a merit on the side of those lovely tacos that are just oh so hard to say no to. I am a sucker for fish tacos and have tried many. Being a connoisseur, it should be taken with some weight that I throw my vote for these tasty, over-loaded tortillas as the best fish tacos in the Valley. They are brimming with different flavors and a touch of spice. Do up the sea bass tacos and your good belly will thank you!"

They fresh squeeze the limes, use Alien tequila, and agave nectar. Very delicious! The sangria is also very good but does not compare to the margaritas. Over the last two visits I have tried the sea scallops crusted with ground up avocado leaves, the sea bass in a cilantro jalapeno sauce, and the chile relleno stuffed with filet mignon and goat cheese. These were all delicious dishes but the sea scallops are still my favorite. They come with a rice that has a diabla sauce on it that adds spice and flavor to the scallops. If you do not usually like scallops because they are lacking in flavor you may enjoy this dish. I really hope that word gets out about this restaurant since it is hidden and not many people seem to know about it."

I often request a vegetarian tamale even when it is not on the menu.\n\nTheir sangria and margaritas are also exceptionally good.\n\nIn the back they have a bar/ lounge area and sometimes have live musicians.

Let me explain...\n\nI made reservations for dinner here before we were to go see Bela Fleck at The Smith Center.  It was our 5 year anniversary and I wanted to have a nice night with a fancy dinner and this place was perfect with its location.  We got to Mundo at about 5:45 and the concert was just a block away and didn't start until 7:30.  Plenty of time, right?\n\nWe were seated immediately and I fell in love with the place.  A romantic atmosphere, a great menu with several vegetarian items, not really pricey, and a friendly wait staff.  My husband started off with a beer (4 bucks! It was a steal!) and I had some really great wine (don't remember the name, white wine from Spain- yum).  We started to munch on chips while we looked at the menu.\n\nMy husband ordered the garden enchiladas and I ordered the chile relleno.  This is where things started to get hairy.  Apparently there is a vegetarian chile relleno as well as steak.  You can see where this is going, can't you?\n\nWe get our dinners and everything looks great.  My husband loves his.  I take a bite of mine and it's really good.  I take a second bite and notice something chewy....that's odd, maybe there's a big mushroom in there?  I start to poke around and find this little brown bit.  Mushroom?  Take a tiny bite.  Nope, don't think so.  Dig a little more and there's a giant piece of steak looking at me.\n\nOk, so again: I know, I know.  Dietary restrictions... can't be picky eating out.  I get it.  But do you know how gross it is to know you've eaten meat for the first time in 4 years?  Uuuuuughhhhhhhhh.  And it didn't even taste like anything!  Take note, meat eaters!\n\nAt this point I am pissed, steak is looking at me, and my waiter is nowhere to be seen.  Why?  Because Mundo decided to have a giant party right next to our table and he was busy taking drink orders for the two dozen people talking as loud as they possibly could.  This party started up about the same time I got my steak chile relleno.  \n\nWell there went our date night.\n\nRomantic atmosphere?  Gone.  Yummy food?  Gone.  Helpful wait staff?  Gone.  It is 6:30 and the concert is starting in an hour.  Needless to say, my poor husband was dealing with a very crabby girl.\n\nSo I'm giving this place 3 stars.  It was my fault for assuming there was only a vegetarian chile relleno on the menu but I also think my waiter should have clarified which one I wanted to order (especially after my husband ordered from the vegetarian menu).  And although our waiter wasn't around the second part of our meal, it wasn't his fault that he got stuck with too many tables and the giant party next to us.  I do, however, hold Mundo accountable for sitting us next to the social hour hovering over our table when we had reservations and there were plenty of seats elsewhere when we first got in.  Not cool.\n\nBut I have to give credit where credit is due, and the food was amazing.  The VEGETARIAN chile relleno was great and my husband loved his enchiladas.  The chips and salsa were good and the side of street corn was probably our favorite thing.  The beer prices are great and the wine prices are average.  I loved my glass of wine.  Our waiter also did give us a (small) discount for the misunderstanding without me complaining (I'm not the type to yell at waiters).  He was also friendly throughout even though he was super busy.\n\nSo, after this giant review I guess what I'm trying to say is this place would have been 5 stars if I wasn't sitting next to the social hour party and especially if I had a meat-free item from the get-go.  The food here is great and the restaurant is beautiful.  It has a perfect location if you are looking for somewhere to eat or drink before heading to The Smith Center.  Just make sure you clarify EXACTLY what you want to order.  I also recommend reservations since it is a little on the smaller side."

I had heard about it from less-than-trustworthy sources (as far as food recommendations go), but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. We went in for a Saturday lunch service, and the place was pretty much empty (maybe four or five tables and our own). The hostess was nice and quickly took us to our table. The decor is electic, I guess, though I thought the wall of sconces was tacky and unnecessary, even more so given that they are located it at a walking distance from one of the only places in Las Vegas were design rules. Other than that, the ambiance was nice, music quite lame (Mexican pop artists, like Paulina Rubio...really?), the lighting dim, and the waiters friendly and biligual. \n\nWe ordered the fried calamari to start (about $15). They were executed well (crunchy, not soggy), and the dipping sauces were nice: one was green, with cilantro and serrano undertones, and the other was basically a chipotle mayo. For entrees, I ordered the chipotle glazed salmon with roasted vegetables, and my husband ordered the short rib enchiladas. The former was very good, though piping hot (maybe left a bit too long under the salamander). It was well portioned, and came drenched in a tomatillo sauce (good), and roasted veggies (including red peppers and zuchinni). It was $18, and overall, it was really good. The salmon was probably a defrosted version, but again, what can you realistically expect in this city?\n\nThe other entree, the short rib enchiladas, were very good (for about $16-$18). If you're really hungry, make sure you stock up on appetizers, as this plate only has two, albeit delicious, enchiladas. They are drenched in a red \"enchilada sauce\" (as most Americans will eagerly call it), and I was pleased to realize that it was very authentic-Mexican-tasting. They were also missing the signature cheddar chesse/sour cream toppings, that were infamously made popular by places like Taco Bell. Overall, they were delicious and I would definitely order them again. \n\nWe asked our waitress for a dessert menu, but she proceded to tell us there were \"churros con chocolate\" available. We shrugged, then she said they also had flan...and coffee. A bit lacking, I would say, and I would have preferred to look at a dessert menu, even though by that point, I was stuffed. \n\nOverall, the service is nice, the ambiance is romantic and casual, and the food is good. Do not expect extremely authentic Mexican flavors, but they are good enough to come back. Further, their location makes you feel you are in a real city, with real buildings!"

I was not hungry but up to socializing with yelpers and a couple of tequilas.\n\n  The tequilas were strong. When I walked into the restaurant later than everybody, some of my yelp friends were laughing and  having a great time. Right off the bat, I had to try their tequila. After I took a few sips of my tequila, I was laughing and very relaxed. The tequila was so good that I wanted another one. This is when I found out that the service here is kind of slow. I knew the waiter was busy serving our group. So I walked across the fancy dining room to the bar. There is an issue. The bar tender was also a waiter. The result was a wait for the tequila. Finally I rejoined my Yelp peers at the table carrying my second tequila.\n\n  The place itself is a nice environment to hang out in. Although it is in the Furniture Center Complex, it is a restaurant that would be at home in Beverly Hills, It is just a very fancy restaurant.\n\n   Interior design and the good times I shared with my Yelper friends is not saving Mundo from achieving above three stars in my review. There are some issues that don't fly by me. First, another Yelper paid for his drink at the bar, and that drink was also reflected on that individuals check. I have been to three restaurants with Yelp peers. This is the first restaurant to add each yelper's tab on one bill. I do not like that! I especially did not like that when the waiter told us that we were $18 short. Even after two strong tequilas! Realistically there is no way to add up everybody's tab and see who came up short. That is if anybody really did come up short. This also begs the question, \"If we paid the tip was there still a gratuity charge?\" We probably will never know. We each chipped in the extra money to make up for the alleged $18 short of paying the bill. Adding each person's tab on one bill is just poor business. Then alleging that we are $18 short is just poor business. The nice environment and socializing with the Yelper friends with the strong tequila kept the rating at three stars.\n\nReview 66 of the 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge"

At the world market center, parking outside is best rather than the parking lot.\n\nThe dining room is spectacular , I felt like I was in a high end restaurant on the strip. It has a modern cool feel.\n\nChips and salsa: crispy and dusted in a chile spice, salsa is fresh and flavorful, with a slight kick to it.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to leave early for work so I did not get a chance to try the food. I will update this if I ever go to this place again.\n\nThis place could have been 5 stars if the hostess would have redeemed my yelp check in offer, which was supposed to be a hi five."

Mundo is pretty much the same concept with the same successful outcome. \n\nI had a gift card that I have wanted to use and I also heard about the 15% off one entree with a Yelp check-in so was eager to try it out.\n\nI had read about bad service from previous Yelp reviewers, but was pleasantly surprised by the service the bartender / waiter gave us. He was very friendly and hospitable. He made the evening quite enjoyable. I started my meal off with an Alien Margarita, which was heavenly, my fella wasn't as lucky with his martini. It was a little, I mean a lot, too strong for either of us to digest. He was a trooper and downed it at the end though. I ordered the filet mignon chile relleno and my fella got the shrimp diablo. Both were amazing. The sauces were perfection, the flavors were well-balanced and the perfect texture. I preferred my dish, but the shrimp was no joke. Super spicy and delicious. I look forward to trying some of the sides and appetizers when I come back with more of an appetite or during Happy Hour.\n\nWe finished our meal with some homemade flan. This was absolutely delicious. I would have preferred no fruit on top as I don't like the mixture of flavors, but this was easily my favorite part of the meal.\n\nI look forward to trying this place again for lunch or maybe even their brunch options and I've heard good things about their Happy Hour. If only the location wasn't so awkward and out of the way. Oh well, totally worth the effort."

Firstly, I would say that though yelpers have rated it \"casual\", it's not--I've spent the entire day walking the strip in the heat--casual.  My dining companion was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and felt under-dressed.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my dining companion had their carnitas.  Neither dish was outstanding.  Maybe I've had a little too much absolutely amazing cheap Mexican food (in both Mexico and places in CA) but if you're charging me nearly 20 bucks for a couple of chicken enchiladas (no sides), then they better be over-the-moon fantastic.  They were not.  Dining companion reported the $24 carnitas solid but not fabulous.  The one redeeming factor was the service.  Our servers were excellent--friendly, prompt, and everything you'd like a server to be!  4 star for the service, 2 star for the food--split the difference and hit it with 3 stars."

Its on the ground floor connected to that Vast Building - World Market Center. This place blends right in the exquisite countours of its surroundings including the  High Society individuals that roam around the floors buying/selling imported designer furniture.. Mundo showcases ULTRA Innovative Modern Classy / Chic Furniture + Lighting. Also a nice patio area for those of you who need to puff on something.\n\nAppetizer:\n\nComes with Chips and 3 Different Salsas for dipping. Standard Nacho/Tortilla chips, 1 mild chunky red salsa, 1 cilantroey tad spicy green salsa and 1 roasted garlic packed brown salsa. All Very Tasty!\n\nQueso Flameado: a mix  of cheese, mushroom, tomatoes and chile with a side of tortillas (I opted for flour). It looked like Abstract Art in a bowl.. First, I took a scoop of it and spread it on one half of the tortilla. Next, I folded over the plain half (make like a half moon or taco). Last, take a bite and enjoy! Just think quesadilla taco?! It was Astonishing! Be careful, to leave room for your entree as this quite a heavy starter.\n\nCarnitas: chunky cubes stacked in the middle of the plate surrounded by a scoop of guacamole, slices of spicy seasoned tomatoes, onions and cilantro with a side of corn tortillas. This wasn't some Taco truck or any other type of carnitas I've seen or had before. Fork cut into it as if it was a razor sharp knife. Extremely tender and packed a mild yet unique pork flavor. A whole new take on carnitas that was remarkably Inspiring!\n\nChilean Sea Bass: jalapeno cilantro lime marinade, potato, jalapeno and tomato, thats been steamed in a banana leaf. It came wrapped in some paper with a couple slices of lime sitting on top. How imaginative, I've never opened a dinner gift before! I gently unwrapped the paper and there it was, a thick fillet of fish with the tomatoes, seasonings, jalapeno and potatoes anchoring it on both sides! The fork just slid through the fish as if nothing was there. This thing was so flaky/soft that it was about to disinigrate!!  I squeezed some of the lime juice on it, picked up a little piece of everything and had a taste.. Great complex flavors of cilantro and spices, it was nothing my palate had experienced before! It really was a gift.. Just the right everything, what a creative and sophisticated dish! Very Impressive!\n\nFlan: small round, the usual looking flan with a little pool of sweet/cinnamony liquid?! Raspberry, Blueberry, nuts and a swipe of red berry syrup placed artisticly around it. Nice mix of colors and placement, another piece of art. Everything on point, no complaints! A nice way to end the night on a sweet note.\n\nA Positive unusual perspective of Flavors, Masterpiece Presentations and First-Class Service!"

            "review": "The food here is great.  The service sucks.\n\nFirst, I came here for dinner and drinks with my husband.  The restaurant looked pretty empty but they sat us next to a service station with a wastepaper basket.  The servers tossed trash past our heads into the trash can until I glared at them enough and they got the hint.  Still, it's not rocket science people. \n\nBut the shrimp Diablo and sea scallops were excellent.  Perfectly yummy.\n\nMore recently, I came here for lunch with a friend.  It was packed and you needed a reservation to sit at a table for lunch.  We ended up sitting at the bar and waiting forever for service.  The bartender handed us menus and then proceeded to run around like a chicken with his head cut off.  He just could not multi-task.  For example, if someone needed a drink refill that was his one and only focus.  He couldn't deal with more than one drink refill at a time, much less any other tasks.  It was painful to watch.\n\nSome people sat next to us and they knew the drill.  When the bartender tried to hand them menus, they refused and rattled off what they wanted before he could get away.  When we tried to order from him after they did, the bartender wasn't having it.  Apparently he could only handle one task at once.  When we finally got him to take our order, he complained to us like it was our fault.  He said, and I quote, \"It's not like I'm just hanging out back here.\"  Ok.  We had to remind him to bring our drink orders and had doubts that he even put our lunch order in.  It was horrendous.\n\nBy the time we got our food, my friend was starving.  She ordered the tortilla soup without cheese because she can't have cheese.  But it came with it anyway.  She had some and then focused on her cheese-free salad.  We knew we'd be there for another hour if we tried to resolve the soup issue, so we just let it go.  I hope she didn't get sick.\n\nBut once again, the food was excellent.  I had the chicken tostada salad which is deconstructed - not exactly what I expected. At first I thought they gave me the wrong thing. But it was really good. It comes with a whole chicken breast and then the tostada off to the side.  The chicken was nice and juicy.  It comes with a great, spicy sauce.  The tostada was crisp with the right amount of beans, salsa, guacamole, cheese, and crema.\n\nThe design of this place is just stupid.  A large chunk of the middle of the bar is taken up by a pile of ice with tequila in it.  Why I have no idea.  And they used to have tables across from the bar but they took those out to put in couches and ottomans.  All this makes no sense to me.  It's not like people are going to the World Market Center to go clubbing.  Yet they are designing it like a club for some reason.  But the restaurant could use more seating, especially during lunch.  They should bring out the couches and weird ice thing on the bar during dinner when it's dead if they think it's so brilliant.\n\nThey do not have the staff to handle the occasional demand for this place.  Plus, the staff I've encountered lack basic common sense. It's disappointing because the food is really well-executed.  Maybe takeout?  I have to give it an A-OK because I love the food.  I hope the service will get better.  I'll give it a few months and try again.  Perhaps."

            "review": "After having been to Mundo twice, once for dinner before a play at The Smith Center, and once for a business lunch I've come to the conclusion that this restaurant is exceptionally good my business lunches because it is so close to my work and it is exceptionally good for a dinner prior to a theater performance because it is so close to The Smith Center. Obviously proximity, driving distance, and location are plus, plus, plus for me!\n\nService has been spotty both times I've been here. Waiters are quick at first, but then service drops off after the meal has been served. Particularly at my business lunch we waited so long for the check that we had to send our client on his way before it arrived so he could get back to work. My manager and I waited around for another 10 minutes or so before we were able to flag down a busser to deliver the check.\n\nAmbiance is great - dark, dimly lit, and the seating is phenomenal. The overall feel of the restaurant is moody and interesting to see.\n\nFood is wavering between a 3 and 4 star rating. Chips (with a dusting of chile) and salsa are provided. Twice I've tried the guac, but I have not been super impressed either times. For lunch I had brisket enchiladas, which may sound amazing - but were sorely disappointing. This was not brisket. Brisket is tenderly cooked meat, juicy and deliciously cared for over a long period of time so it will exude a brilliant BBQ flavor to the person eating it. The \"brisket\" in my enchiladas was just meat - nothing more.\n\nFood during my dinner experience was better. I had the ahi tuna tostada - delish little dish on the app menu. Vibrant on the plate - the fish was fresh, that is for sure. I was surprised to find it to have a very lemony, yet, fresh taste with the added herbs and red chile vinaigrette. I also had the chicken tortilla soup, while a little over-salted, was not bad. Considering it came out in a cup, there was still plenty of chicken to be had. This chicken was good, tender, with little to no grizzly bits or yucky fat chunks (I hate that in soups especially). \n\nOur table also shared the wild mushrooms, which can be found on the Side Dishes portion of the menu. We ended up topping our ahi tostadas with our mushrooms as well, which made for a delightful fulfilling meal before attending our play. These mushrooms were not over-cooked, had good flavor, and come with garlic chips (and some full sized garlic cloves) - to give the dish a kick. I highly recommend this dish if you come here, whether you have a main entree or appetizers like my party did.\n\nOverall I would return. The decor and food is good. Service seems to be a weak spot. The food ideas here are inventive, and at least you may run into something here you would not find anywhere else."

I got the Street Corn.  The pork was a beautiful presentation - four small but thick rounds of meat that were cooked to perfection.  I think it's the best pork tenderloin I've ever had, stupendously succulent and delicious. The street corn was a surprise:  I was expecting a roasted corn on the cob;  happily, the chef did the dirty work and I enjoyed a large serving of corn mixed with chile de arbol and cotija cheese that had a citrus-y tang.  Very rich. I shared it with Herb and still have half a portion to enjoy tomorrow, along with half of my pork dish.  Herb's Filet Mignon Chile Relleno was also delicious\n\nService was excellent, and I loved the modern ambience enhanced with lighting that was traditionally Mexican.

There are a grip of beers for $3 and even more options at $4. We had five or six different appetizers that were offered on the HH menu and were not let down by a single one. The ambient mood that is there is so nice and easing. You really feel like you can relax there. The music is the perfect volume and they play some really nice tranquil tunes. The decorations are very nice and the lighting is nice and dim too. Not too low like a drug den but just low enough so you can see everyone and everything but don't feel like you're in a cafeteria or operating room."

We started with the queso flameado and guacamole.  \n\nUnfortunately, they served our 2 quesos with 6 tortillas and we had 7 people.  Honestly Mundo!?!? You can't serve 1 tortilla per person when we ordered $28 worth of queso??? Not cool.  We asked for more tortillas and received them approximately 12 minutes later after the cheese had congealed.\n\nI had the scallops.  They were seared with a cripy outside and tender inside; topped with a mango  brunoise and accompanied with a flavorful rice.  It was delicious - SPICY!\n\nEveryone else was pleased with their meals too.  All plates were spotless after the meal!\n\nService was mediocre at best but food delicious as always."

My 1st impression is how attentive our wait staff was. I ordered the skirt steak with the Mexican corn, WOW!, it was sooo good. The food tasted very fresh. For dessert I had the flan and shared some churros with the table, the chocolate the churros came with was amazing, the waiter told me they make it in house with Mexican chocolate.. great move!

            "review": "My boyfriend brought me here for a surprise celebration brunch this past Saturday.  Eleven o'clok on the dot on a fabulous Saturday morning we walk into this trendy restaurant - first ones there and quickly seated of course.  We were seated on a two person table with one chair that looked like a king's throne and the other was just a regular black restaurant chair.  Not that chairs matter because they don't.  The table was extremely wobbly, but their food runner was able to fix it for us.  \n\nService started off extremely slow.  My coffee and Edgar's arnold palmer came about ten minutes after ordering- which to me is much too long of a wait for drinks.  Edgar could see my annoyance and quickly reminded me to \"give it a chance and just enjoy myself.\"  I know I know.  I'm a bit of a snob with places like this, but hey- I'll give credit where credit is due! \n\nThe drinks came.  Coffee was okay (had tidbits of coffee remnants in it), and his arnold palmer was straight up iced tea.  BUT, the second round of drinks were fabulous, so I'll cut them some slack on that.  It was early, we were the first ones there- I understand the rough patches.\n\nAnyhow - we splurged today.  I ordered the benedicts and mexican french toast.  He ordered the chilaquiles and vanilla pancakes.  \n\nComplimentary chips and salsa were brought out first.  The chips were seasoned, but I wish they were warm.  It seemed like it was just taken out of a bag, and the salsa tasted bottled.  BOTTLED?!  Ahh!  I'm not 100% certain that it was because I didn't ask, but it didn't have that fresh taste.  HOWEVER I won't count this against the restaurants since #1) it's free and #2) chips and salsa - who cares??\n\nBenedict Mexicano: Fabulous.  Their take on eggs benedicts is divine.  Instead of an english muffin they make their own jalapeno cornbread.  It was just a tad too sweet to my liking, but it was nicely balanced out with their take on hollandaise sauce (tasted very creamy - like they used la crema?) and pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon.  Oh, and each topped with a perfectly poached egg.  When you cracked the egg, and the creamy yolk ever so slowly spread throughout the dish like molten lava over a valley, you couldn't help but try to make time go faster.  Okay, the yolk wasn't spreading that slowly, but that's what it felt like - I couldn't help that time was going in slow motion because of the beauty of the dish, give me a break will yea?  But oh my word, it was great!  The hollandaise didn't have that lemony zest taste like standard run of the mill hollandaise.  It was crema creamy and had a slight green chile flavor to it.  You can see the bits of green chile, but the flavor was very very light so not to overpower the sauce.  \n\nChicken Chilaquiles: Looked dry, but it was juicy as heck!  Everything was nicely balanced, and the flavors - oh the flavors.  It all worked harmoniously together .  \n\nAs for the french toast and vanilla pancakes.  Ehh- they were good, but they weren't out of this world fantastic.  I wouldn't go screaming at the top of my lungs for everyone far and wide to try them.  I was searching high and low for the oaxacan chocolate butter on the french toast, and I think it ran away upon arriving to the table.  It was nowhere to be found.  The dulce de crema spread was good and not too sweet, so I liked that.  The pancakes I just got a bite of, so I can't really judge it.  It was more on the dense side, but the vanilla flavor was present and very nice.\n\nThey then surprised me with my favorite dessert -- FLAN!  The flan (don't tell my mama) was ALMOST like hers!  It was WONDERFUL!  It was light but decadent and had all the flavors you look for in flan.  Caramely, creamy, sweet goodness.  I reminded Edgar that he wasn't a big fan of flan, so it was okay if he didn't eat it with me.  Low and behold, he forgot his dislike for flan because he helped me with half of it!  \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely come back.  The price was great for the quality and flavors you got, and it is definitely a gem of a place.  The decor is trendy, hip and fun - I can imagine how fun it is at night too.  I hope it draws a greater crowd because it'd be terrible to see it go."

It's absolutely fabulous and everything is fresh, fresh, fresh!  Fun, modern, eclectic decor allows for a relaxed evening or a fun night out with friends.  Great stocked bar with one of the best margaritas I've had in Vegas so far. \n\nHowever, my only complaint is that when we first went here we came with big group of people and I had made reservations ahead of time.  We stayed a long time, ordered bottles of wine and lots of food.  But for some reason our server was very confused and somewhat irritated when we said we wanted to split the check amongst the couples.  He huffed and puffed about it being difficult to split the check etc. but in the end did it for us even after we marked the bill accordingly with each couples' items. \n\nI'm sorry, I used to be a server and 1) it's not hard to split a check with the automated system that I saw this restaurant had and 2) you should pretty much assume that one person in a large group of people is not going to pick up the whole bill.  It would have been nice if our server had hashed the particulars with us ahead of time before we all had a wonderful evening and then had to deal with bill drama.  Perhaps if you go here with a lot of friends tell the server up front you will be splitting the check accordingly.\n\nOtherwise, I would highly recommend Mundo as an off-Strip but tasty find."

            "review": "Mundo is a small place that I had never heard of before. It is located in the World Market Center. We went here on a weekend afternoon and there wasn't a lot of staff. We had a huge table, and they took a while even just to come get our drink order. The place wasn't busy or anything, otherwise I would have forgiven it more. That's a big annoyance of mine. Thankfully though, after that setback, everything ran a lot smoother until it was time for the check. They struggle with splitting up checks. Like really had an issue with it. It makes the place look pretty incompetent and we had to all manually figure out what we owed. They bring you some chips and salsa before your meal. They were really tasty. Mundo makes a pretty refreshing mojito. And after the salty chips, the mojito was very welcomed. \n\nI ordered the short rib enchilada. You get two enchiladas. At first I thought it wasn't much food, but between the chips, the drink and the enhiladas, I was stuffed. The meat was very tender and the sauce was great! I'd order that again anytime. But it's still pricey for two enchiladas. \n\nThe place has a really nice ambiance as well. It had a really nice design, along with classy lighting. I felt underdressed coming from Springs Preserve. But it wasn't a pretentious place, where you would mind being a little underdressed very much. All in all, if in the area, Mundo is worth checking out. I wasn't head over heels enough to make the trek for it specifically though. Step up the service, add at least one more enchilada for the price you charge (or just adjust the price), and figure out how to use your point of sale system and you'll be a four or maybe even five star spot in my eyes. The food doesn't need to be changed at all though, it was delicious."

When we entered, there was no hostess, so we went near the bar area and asked one of the waiters if we just seat ourselves. He said, \"Yeah go ahead, sit anywhere and one of the other waiters will help you.\" Ok, no problem. We looked over the happy hour menu and decided upon a Sangria ($5), Mundo Martini ($6), Mundo Fries ($3), and Crispy Calamari ($8). If only there were someone willing to take our orders.... Ten minutes passes by and we still haven't been greeted by any of the waiters.\n\nWe notice a group of people coming in the restaurant and figure we're sure to be helped before they are. Wrong! The hostess that wasn't there before goes up to them and starts hugging everyone. They're all given a table, menus, and water immediately. That really ticked us off, so Don just went up to the bar and asked them if we're just suppose to order at the bar and bring the food/drinks to our table ourselves. The bartender felt pretty bad that we hadn't been helped at all yet, so she said she'd get everything for us. She took our orders, had water and complimentary chips/dip sent to our table, and brought the drinks over to our table. She was pretty much our server for the rest of our time there. Her customer service alone is what made us decide to give the place another star. Rather than just making us wait for someone else to finally come along, she went out of her way to start serving us on her own even though it wasn't her job. She kept coming over to our table to ask us how we were doing and how we were liking the food and drinks too.\n\nOne of the other servers finally came up to us (before we got our food and drinks) and just said, \"Are you guys going to be ordering anything?\" Seriously!? As if we were just planning on lounging at a dining table looking around for waiters for no reason... That guy never even greeted or said anything to us in the first place. It was really annoying. We told him we waited for a long time, so we just went to the bar to order. I feel like our bartender/waitress did a better job than any of the actual waiters would've done.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nThis is what really made me decide to give Mundo a four star rating. The calamari dish was probably one of the best I've ever had. I am a big fan of crispy (not burned) food and, just like the title says, the calamari is very crispy. They managed to make it very crispy, but not oily or greasy. It came with two sauces: cilantro serrano and sweet chipotle . They were both very good; It was even hard to decide which one I wanted to dip my calamari in. I would venture out here just for this dish alone. The Mundo Fries (sweet potato and Idaho potato) were also phenomenal. They were very crispy on the outside but perfectly cooked on the inside. The seasonings added to both dishes really intensified the flavors. I could eat both dishes without any dipping sauces and they'd still taste fantastic. Don described the complimentary chips we got as tasting \"organic.\" I'm guessing that's a good thing? I don't know, but they tasted good with the salsa and both of the dipping sauces that came with the calamari (yes, I like to experiment).\n\nTo be honest, I REALLY wanted to give this place one star in the beginning, but the more the bartender helped the more I thought to myself, \"Oh no, I can't give them one star anymore, she's too nice!\" Then they brought out the food and I was totally sold. This is the perfect spot for a romantic date. The ambiance, delicious food, and super nice BARTENDERS really saved my experience."

This would be a great place to bring a date (just be aware that its kind of in a odd spot inside the hugeness of the World Market Center!)\n\nThe food is pretty darn delicious!  Some of the things we tried:\n\n- Shrimp tamales:  HUGE shrimp.  Perfectly cooked.  The tamales' insides were oh so good.  A little bit sweet and a perfect compliment to the shrimp.\n- Carnitas:  Super moist, great flavor.  I wasn't wow-ed by it when I compared it to my shrimp tamales, but still very good.\n- Wagyu skirt steak:  What the what!  So good!  The chimichurri gives it such a great flavor and it was so tender.  Its a melt in your mouth type of meat. \n- Calamari:  Your standard calamari.  I liked the breading.  It came with two sauces.  I think it was the chipotle one that was pretty good.\n\nWe got complimentary chips and salsa too.  The salsa was so good!  Very fresh and light.\n\nService was a little strange.  I wasn't sure if we had just one waiter or two.  When you asked them a question, it was like a one word answer.  Its not like they were rude... they just weren't nice.  Plus they kept taking our plates away when we weren't completely done.  It could have been because it was the end of the night and they were trying to move us along?  No clue.  Maybe we caught them on an off night?  I think if we had better service, my experience here would have been over the top.\n\nAlthough the prices are on the higher side, this place is definitetly worth a try and its great for special occasions.

Highly recommended if you like melted cheese with tons of flavor (combination of cheese, mushrooms, tomato and a green chile sauce)\n\n-Entree: Chilean Seabass:  Wow, this was so good.  When I ate here the first time, I wasn't a fish person.  This time around, I was glad that I tried this entree.  The fish was super tasty and the fattiness just melts in your mouth.  Was perfectly seasoned and steamed to perfection.  The jalapeno cilantro lime marinade was the perfect marinade for this fatty fish.  yum yum yum.\n\n-Entree: Prime Filet Mignon:  Nice cut, but over cooked.  We asked for medium rare, it came  out medium.  If only this was cooked to how we ordered, Mundo may have received 5 stars,  but that didn't happen.  However, the sauce was delicious.  \n\n-Side: Mexican Risotto : I asked our server which side is the most popular and he recommended this side...we were kinda set on this side prior to asking him for recommendation, but I wanted to confirm that it's good.  Indeed it is!  This risotto had poblano chile, corn and cilantro.  Was very rich and creamy.\n\n-Dessert: Banana Empanadas:  Again, recommendation by our server and yet again, a hit at our table.  It's batter-fried banana with caramel drizzled on top and a scoop of creamy icecream. Was the perfect way to finish this wonderful dinner.\n\n-Drinks: Alien Margarita and Mojito:  The margarita was very good with the salt.  My favorite part of it is after the server pour the tequila from a small 'Alien' glass bottle, the bottle is for you to keep if you wish.  The mojita was nice and strong.\n\nOverall, a 4-star dining experience.  Ambiance was great, the service was great (thank god we had a good server), the food was almost perfect.  Highly recommended."

The restaurant was very busy on this Friday afternoon so it was fortunate that we held reservations.   We received a bowl of taco chips plus 3 housemade salsas.  We both ordered the jalape\u00f1o chile spiced chicken enchiladas with roasted tomatillo sauce, salsa asada, melted chihuahua cheese and crema fresca.  Everything was very good including the service until our waiter was reassigned to duties at the bar."

            "review": "Mundo, who knew?  For those at the North Outlet shops the architects must have intentionally built this restaurant in such a way that you will not be able to easily access it.  There is a essentially a giant wall surrounding the entire corporate building which Mundo is located right in the middle of.  \n\nHead to the Cheese Cake Factory then cross the street to the corporate building.  Making your way to the right or heading to the melting clinic.  You will know it when you see it.  Walk along the front of the corporate building to the parking lot.  Turn left and keep going.  When you near the dumpsters your getting close.  Really.  Turn the corner and your nearly there.  \n\nWelcome to Mundo.  Head in.  Having struggled to find the place and more than irritated after cooking in the sun. I was not a happy camper.  But the dim lights and cool setting quickly bought my mood back to normal.  Once again, not expecting much I was pleasantly surprised.  When the cheese quesadilla arrived.  It was amazing. Fresh ingredients, with an assortment of small beans marinated in a light but zesty seasoning.  The melody of flavors that came together wonderfully.\n\nWe also ordered the veg enchilada which to my great delight was also incredibly good. \n\nThe setting is a little industrial with some large tapestries and old furniture that fill the space.  But once the food arrives you will not notice. Service was a little slow (water glass hit empty more than once) even though it was not busy (still early).  \n\nWhen your done get ready to trek back around.\n\nDo not be tempted by the Cheese Cake Factory.  Mundo's is worth the effort."

Anyhow - the restaurant has a nice, contemporary but comfortable decor - which is obvious, I guess, because of it's location.  The service is pretty slow - we came here for lunch on a friday around 1pm - it is a small restaurant, but in including ours there were probably only 4 table of patrons.  The menu is large and creative, and the food was quite good and tasty.  My only complaint was that my food did not come out hot - it was barely lukewarm - but I had waited so long for it to come out, I was too hungry to send it back.  The same thing for my buddy's entree.  Anyhow - I would go back, but not if it were out of my way."

Also, the guacamole had a lot of additional ingredients:  peppers, onion, tomato, radishes, etc.  It was fantastic as well.\n\nFor lunch, I had the wagyu fajitas.  These were EXCELLENT and for $20 you get quite a lot of food.  The steak is heavily - but not overly so - seasoned, as are the accompanying onions and peppers.  You also get rice and beans, it's more than enough to make 3 good sized fajitas.  We also had the shrimp tacos, which are a staple for us at Mundo.  3 tacos in smaller size tortillas, they fill them to the brim, to the point you will probably have to resort to a fork at times.  They are crispy and flavorful, which is why one of us typically gets them.\n\nToday, we shared the street corn, which is taken off the cob and mixed with cojita cheese, crema, and spices.  It was excellent, better than many creamed corn dishes I've had at fancy steakhouses.  This side dish is a must, the corn is firm and retains a lot of its crunch.  The cheese is noticeable, and the spices add flavor without overwhelming.  Can't believe I haven't eaten this before.\n\nAlso, none of our drinks got close to empty.  Excellent service throughout.  Highly recommend Mundo."

Guacamole was nice and fresh My husband had the wagu skirt steak salad and it was delicious. My son had the chicken enchiladas and it was good but a little soupy for my taste. I had the chicken tostado salad.  It came with a delicious roasted chicken thigh with some char.  Couldn't really taste the black beans on the chalupa shell .

            "review": "The location is beautiful and interior has a unique touch so it has a lot of promise to be a great daytime business lunch or a cozy dinner date. \n\nWe were just at the Premium Outlets next door and Yelperazzi needs some drinks. \n\nThere were three different waiters coming to our table at first and that's a lot of milling about when they don't coordinate with each other. One already talked to us about drinks, another took our order, another wanted to give us menus and take our order again. The ordering waiter was pushing hard for us to get appetizers when we were going to just try a drink and sit here deciding our next venue. We were just left alone after given drinks and complimentary chips until we were brought a check. \n\nI got the Mundo Martini - Elnino said mine tasted like mountain dew blue. I've never had that, but the blue curacao and pineapple definitely come through and it's a sweet drink. I liked mine, but it wasn't the most palette tantalizing drink out there.\n\nThe Sassy Senority Margarita went to our sassy gal Lily. It has prickly pear in it and the juice was going bad which made the \"feet\" taste. We suggest they taste check their juices periodically. \n\nElninos drink, the Paloma had grapefruit in it, but I barely tasted it since it seems they didn't put juice- just a fruit slice. It was strong alcohol if you drink from one part of the drink and then water on the other. Mixed up well since the flavors weren't together and then it was watered down vodka with a grapefruit in it. \n\nEl Andys probably was the most \"complex\" in fragrance, but still was more sweet than anything. Still, the Spanish Kiss wasn't even a peck on the cheek. \n\nAll our drinks were $8-$11 which is a theft for drinks that didn't impress.(Sorry and thanks El Andy). Shoulda went to Herbs&Rye for a cocktail! \n\n So this isn't our spot for drinks it seems but I'll give them another try for Happy Hour appetizers and also I have a GC for dinner so I'll save the next review for the most important items- the food. For now, I think for the weirdly enthusiastic, pushy service turned cold to the subpar drinks the 2 I think is fair."

I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the waiter who was helping my table was rude and overstepped many boundaries. He made a comment about me being white (which I am not) because I was born in the United States. I retorted saying he was racist. He replied with, \" You were born here so you are white.\" I  told him where I was born was none of his business and just because I was born here does not make me white.

Then on to Chicken Tortilla soup with attractive presentation and taste that did not disappoint. This thick, rich soup had many different flavors blended perfectly without any one flavor being over-bearing. I had read reviews on Yelp that said \"you must eat the Mexican style street corn\" so we did.  All I can say is the same, \"you MUST eat this corn\"-with chile arbol, cotija cheese, citrus + cilantro .  MORE MUST: Mexican risotto : -with chile poblano, corn, & cilantro,  AND  Saut\u00e9ed Spinach:- with charred onions + jalape\u00f1os. The soup and sharing of the sides filled us up 'just right' before heading over to the Smith Center Opera night.\nI will definitely keep this restaurant on my \"Let's go back\" list."

It is pricey, but I knew that going in and we had a $25 Restaurant.com certificate.\n\nWe were brought the chips and salsa and we ordered the guacamole.  The salsa and guacamole were great!  The waiter gave us plenty of time to study the menu.  When we were not yet decided, we asked him over to answer some of our questions. Based on his full knowledge of the menu items and their manner of cooking, we ordered.  My wife got the pollo rostisado with a side of spinach with garlic and onions.  The side came with her meal.  Since she's such a gringa, she had them make the spinach without the jalape\u00f1os (what a shame!).  Her chicken came with a great seasoning and she got the tamarind chile glaze in a side dish.  Together, the seasoning and the tamarind glaze were superb!\n\nI ordered the sea scallops with diablo spiced rice, ripe mango relish, and an avocado leaf crust on the scallops.  This was another winner with great seasoning - spicy on the scallops and good zing with the rice.  I ordered a side of Mexican style street corn with chile arbol, cotija cheese, with citrus and cilantro.  The corn was very good and it also had good spiciness.\n\nI decided to go for dessert, too.  I ordered the churros.  They serve them with caramel inside and some caramel drizzled over them.  There's a small bowl of Mexican chocolate for dipping the churros or spooning on and a small dip of vanilla ice cream.  It was a perfect end to this dinner.\n\nI really like Mundo.

We brought our 2.5 year old out for a nice family dinner, which I must admit I was nervous about after reading other guest reviews. We had no problem taking him with us, the staff were welcoming enough. There were even a couple of other families with kids of varying ages, which raised the comfort level at 8pm on a Saturday evening. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated, romantic, etc...we enjoyed the atmosphere while ordering some fresh guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa and my Cadillac margarita. The margarita was delicious, the guacamole was good but nothing out of this world. The salsa was also okay by my review, my date really enjoyed the salsa, I prefer char in my salsa, so it's just a matter of difference of tastes\n\nFor dinner, I went with the vegetarian tamale and a side of wild mushrooms. My date went with the chicken enchilada with side of fries (kid friendly). I'm not a vegetarian, but this dish just sounded good for my tastes that eveining and also think if a restaurant can serve up a really tasty vegetarian dish, they can pack some flavor. I didn't notice a kids menu, so we decided to share our dishes and our son liked the chicken enchilada, the fries were a big hit, and I even got some of my veggies in , which meant we would be ordering a dessert (we usually skip dessert) 8)\n\nI really enjoyed the tamale, everything was flavorful and spicy, but not overly spiced. Good sauce, vegetables were cooked properly and the filling was a good level of sweetness to balance. Also, with the chips, guacamole, sides, etc, there's no way I could eat the whole thing, so most went home for lunch the next day, bonus! And, like I mentioned, even got the 2.5 year old to try a few bites. Wild mushrooms were satisfying. I tried a bite of the enchilada and though the chicken was maybe on the dryer side, the favors were very good and my partner finished it all with the help of out son. The fries are a mix of potatoes and sweet potatoes-  they didn't stand a chance against our son, he loved those! We tried them, they were yummy.\n\nLast part of the evening were the churros. They come with a chocolate dipping sauce. I wasn't blown away, but they were a good sweet ending. \nWe will go again, probably just the 2 of us for date night next time."

The location is fun if you're early & get a chance to wander around the huge World Market Center and decorate and redecorate both the home you have and your dream home over and over in your mind.  A nice way to work up an appetite.  Once we arrived to actually eat dinner, the service by everyone was fabulous.  The chef was very kind and accomodating and came out to speak with a woman about to order who didn't \"like spice\" and come up with something that would be to her liking.  No overinflated ego despite chicken-cooking superpowers.\n\nA couple bummers:\n-Too little of that delicious sauce with the chicken.\n-Didn't like the chips nor any of the three accompanying salsas.\n-Nothing special about the carnitas.\n-With such amazing fillings, it's a bummer the tortillas (both corn and flour) didn't taste made on site (even if they were.  I don't know.).\n-We didn't get the warmest welcome when we entered the restaurant for the very first time behind another group of people only to be snapped at by a cranky waiter whose only words to us were, \"We're not open yet\".  OK.  This being our first visit and seeing several people enter before us, we thought we'd make a dinner reservation.  We turned around and left (didn't make a reservation) and almost didn't return after such a terrible first impression.  That dude needs some serious training and we were so happy to not be seated in his section when we returned.\n\nStill, there's no doubt I will be back.  I'll avoid that waiter again & order that delicious chicken again.  I think this place will only get better.  Be prepared to pay a pretty penny for the experience (but Restaurant.com or 3oclockclub.com can make it a little easier)."

Think freshness, flair, and fab flavor. This is not you're mamacita's Mexican restaurant. Dishes that are ordinary at other Mexican eateries are extraordinary at Mundo. This is on the upper end of the pricing scale compared to most Mexican places, with most dinner entrees in the $20-$40 range-lunch $10-$20 (a la carte), but this is clearly more labor intensive food, prepared with soul, fusing fresh-top notch ingredients into a world of savory flavors. \n\nMundo-A Culinary Haute Spot, will rock you're mundo (world)."

This was my 1st visit & definitely not my last. The ambiance makes it a great date spot or meeting friends. Our server Alberto was very helpful & attentive. The prices are reasonable for what is offered. The chips & salsa were good. The salsa had flavor & the blend was really good. The chili on the chips added just the right amount of flavor to compliment the salsa. We had:\n\nMundo margarita- I will say this was very weak. Too much mix & it overpowered the drink. Won't order again but will try another libation next time. \n\nMundo chopped salad- absolutely LOVE! This salad is spicy, sweet, crisp & so flavorful. One of the best salads I've had in a long time. A definite must if you come here. You won't be disappointed. \n\nChilean Sea Bass- wasn't impressed. Sea bass is a very light fish & the jalapeno cilantro lime marinade was too overpowering for it. The marinade had great flavor & was spicy but if I was blindfolded I wouldn't know I was eating sea bass. It's a great choice if you don't like fish cause you won't know that you're eating fish. Bad choice of you actually like fish & would like to be able to taste it. Won't order again.\n\nVegetarian chili relleno- Wow! It was amazing! The flavors of the pepper along with the cheese. & black beans was a burst of heaven to the taste buds. It was absolutely amazing. Definitely would order again. \n\nCoconut tres leches cake with berry compote- the perfect ending to a great meal. It's light & refreshing & the perfect dessert to soothe your mouth after the spicy meal. \n\nYou must try this place if you haven't already! Your tastebuds will thank you!"

Overall, I am pretty happy I did. \nThe d\u00e9cor is beautiful, but after walking through all buildings at WMC, and seeing all the amazing furniture, art, and exquisite design, I would expect nothing less. They are feeding marketers, design teams, and CEO's from some of the biggest furniture stores in the world, they better have their stuff together. \nI don't think they are open on weekends, and I believe there are no kids allowed. I cant confirm or deny that personally. However I have never seen minors, or staff on weekends. They truly know who their cliental is, and work on catering to their needs. \nMy first trip I just ordered some To-go food in between jobs. \nI went with the Mexican Risotto and the Chicken taquitos. \nI would order the risotto again. The rice was cooked perfectly, it was creamy, and had hints of lime, cilantro, and Mexican corn throughout. \nThe taquitos were your basic fresh mex rolled tacos. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. \nAlso, even though it was a take out order, they hooked up the chips and salsa which I appreciate. \nMy second trip I got off early at World Market, and had the time to dine in. They were packed with people, so I sat solo at the bar. Wonderful customer service and knowledge from the bar staff. I was contemplating between a couple dishes, and the bartender told me all his favorites, as well as their best sellers. \nI went with the Mahi Mahi with jalapeno rice and a baby springs salad. \nThe salad was bland, and stayed on my plate. I was wishing they served more of this rice, because it came with chorizo and jalapenos and I was loving it. \nThe fish was cooked perfect, blackened on the outside but flaky and juicy in the center. It needed a squeeze of lemon, but that's it. \nPrices are on the touristy side, but again, they cater to a specific crowd. I spent $27 before a tip for my fish and a coke. \nAlso, parking sucks because there isn't any. There is valet, sometimes. \nOverall, the owners were smart. Not only smart, but someone has a good palate and management skills because the staff rocks. \nI hope they choose to expand their hours, and maybe offer a locals discount? Totally would win me over."

As hard as it was to find/get to this place, the u-turns and wandering around were all worth it. Talk about fancy Mexican food!\n\nWe arrived for a casually late sunday lunch, and were treated to some of the best food and service I've had in Vegas. The servers were all friendly and accommodating. Our waiter even did some \"magic\" and poured my bf's beer almost sideways.  I started out with a cool and fizzy sangria. *bonus points to the waiter for having \"Pauly D\" hair!!\n\nThe trio of salsas is great - something for everyone. I also liked how you can really taste the corn in their chips. Moving on, we ordered a queso flameado which was something kind of wonderful and didn't last long enough to take a picture of it. It's a big bowl of loving - 5 cheeses melted together with marinated mushrooms and tomatoes, then drizzled with a serrano chile sauce. Makes for some excellent impromptu quesadillas with the salsa from the chips and the tortillas they provide.\n\nI got my favorite fish (the Chilean sea bass) tacos. They were so good I didn't mind eating them with my usually-hated avocado. The tortillas are nice and corny, the fish is fried in a light, crisp batter, and the slaw packs a delicious crunch. I snagged a bite of my bf's short rib enchiladas, and he touted the sauce as reminiscent of chef boyardee. The meat was so tender.\n\nThe food was so great that I couldn't find any room in my stomach for dessert. Wow.\n\nThis is definitely a must. Put it on your culinary map!"

After reading some glowing reviews we went to treat ourselves for an anniversary dinner.  Overall, food and atmosphere were both very pleasing, but I wasn't absolutely blown away.  Due to the relatively high price (we went for dinner), this isn't going to replace your weekly neighborhood Mexican joint, but definitely worth a visit for special occasions.\n\nWe started our meal with the \"queso flameado\", asadero cheese, goat cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, and a serrano sauce.  YUM!  This was delicious, although it was essentially a bowl full of cheese.  We had way too much cheese for the few toasts provided, so ended up eating it straight.  This dish is probably better suited for a group of 4 than 2.  I'd prefer half the amount, and half the price so we could order a second appetizer!  I ordered the sangria that was way too sweet for my tastes (I prefer dry wines though, so I'm a bit finicky about sangria).  My boyfriend had a well made martini, and for his main course he ordered the \"sarape de pollo\", which was a simple pounded chicken breast with a limey dressing, black beans, cheese, guac, and pico.  He very much enjoyed it, I found it a bit too salty.  I ordered a seafood special, that was quite good, with a side of the famous sweet corn tamales.  The texture of the \"tamales\" was devine, but it was a bit too sweet for my tastes for the main meal.  I pretended I was eating desert with my meal and was happy.\n\nFor what it is, the price is appropriate and the food is relatively creative.  I would definitely return for a nice dinner or give the lunch specials a try (if it weren't so far away from my office), and I recommend others check it out, it's unlike any other I've found in Vegas."

I'm a vegetarian so I loved that they had a special section dedicated for me, I hate skimming through options and liking what I read then I hit the meat ingredient and have to keep going. Nothing on the vegetarian section seemed appealing, so I asked the waiter if I could get a simple cheese enchilada with beans & rice on the side and they accommodated to my request. The enchilada was delicious, the tomato sauce had a hint of garlic which gave it a wonderful flavor. The beans were not to heavy and good and as for the rice it was white rice with some vegetables in it, went well with my enchilada. After our meal we got desert, they have several options a delicious churro being on of them haha but I picked the tres leeches cake.

We all had their Cadillac margaritas, which was good not spectacular - but we were all in the mood to have a few drinks. Had mojito, sangria, and one other drink that I can't remember now. Their drinks are strong and hit the spot.\n\nWe had chips and guacamole, tuna tostada, chopped salad for appetizer, then sea bass, filet mignon, shrimp diablo, and skirt steak as entrees with sides of mexican risotto, wild mushrooms, and spinach with jalepeno.\n\nOf course they have to have great guacamole -- it's a standard for Mexican! No?\n\nThe Tuna tostada was interesting... it's a tortilla triangle with a thin layer of tuna with some type of sweet glaze. i liked it a lot, but the rest of the table was just OK about it. We all thought the chopped salad was delicious - lots of little chunky veggies and seasoned so it was a tad on the sweet side but enough acid to balance. I'd eat just that for lunch.\n\nEveryone enjoyed their entrees. I think the sea bass was the best. It was steamed in parchment, and was the most moist and flavorful fish I've had in a while. Next time I go back for dinner, I'm going to order sea bass. Both of the steaks were good but it's steak - nothing special in my opinion. My shrimp diablo was good, just a tad salty but great flavors - a little spicy but tasty. I only at two shrimp -- it came with six -- because I was too full by then. The bed of mexican herbal rice that came with my shrimp was really really good. The sides especially the wild mushrooms are a must. The risotto was OK along with the spinach.\n\nUsually, I go for lunch, and it was the first time for dinner, and it was great. The only uncomfortable thing about the meal was at the end, our waiter come to tell us that we only left him $36 in tip which was 15% (I don't tip on the tax) -- which I thought was a bit rude for a waiter to come and tell you that you had only tipped 15%. We all sort of looked at each other and said, OK... we'll discuss it. We left him a few more bucks...but honestly, it sort of ended a great evening with an odd feeling for the restaurant."

I eat here often but why the hell do they close at 9pm on a Saturday night..that's usually rush hour at most restaurants..a little over a year ago i tried to bring my best friend here for dinner the night before he had to leave for his deployment to Afghanistan with the Army..we showed up over an hour before closing (at7 and closed at 8) and the hostess said they were closed..kinda pissed me off after how many friends I've told to come here..we were about to go tonight but didn't realize they closed that early. I'll definitely still come back ..but if u decide to eat here jus make sure u show up early if u want a guaranteed dinner there but what do you expect with a location like that..I imagine their main concern is to cater to the guests if World Market Center"

The decor is gorgeous; it's a great place for a date once you get to the restaurant...it's in the world market complex which is a kind of strange location for going to dinner.  I had the deliciously flavored waygu flank steak w/an avocado mixture on top.  I will probably order the same thing the next time I go here, it was SO GOOD!  The side of Mexican street corn was awesome too.  My husband had the Chilean sea bass, he said it was the best he's had.  The mundo martinis and banana empanadas for dessert were delicious too.  The server was very attentive and did an excellent job."

We finally got around to it for my husband's birthday a few weeks ago.\n\nI wasn't crazy about the location, but it is a short walk from the Smith Center.\n\nWe were seated right away. While we were looking over the menus, I mentioned to my husband that I was going to order a glass of wine. And, our server (I think his name was Jose) brought it over immediately without me even asking, which really impressed me. \n\nDo not fill up on the homemade tortilla chips and salsa they bring you because the food was pretty awesome. I had the cilantro lime sea bass which was excellent, and my husband had the carnitas. He said they were sweeter than what he was expecting, but also delicious. The rock star of the meal was the Mexican street corn we split. It was to die for, and I have been thinking about it ever since. SO GOOD!!!\n\nWe ordered dessert. I had the flan and my husband had the chocolate tres leches cake. Both were just OK.\n\nI think we spent around $100 bucks including the tip.

The atmosphere is very unique and early in the evening they weren't slammed like everything else in Vegas. Great gracious staff and plenty of easy parking.\nNow the food, WOW! The richest and most flavorful salsa I have ever had, period! \n\nTried the queso flameado with corn tortillas and the chips, very flavorful and a great value.\n\nThe piece de resistance was the prime filet mignon. This was a fabulous filet that was cooked perfect medium. The char was second to none I've had some Burn's in Tampa. Marry this with the sauces and add the mushrooms and you are in for a culinary experience.

We went on Valentine's Day but it wasn't that busy around 6p. Started with the Mundo salad, it was shredded with lots of good things like veggies, nuts, and I think some dried fruit. We liked it very much. The queso app that everyone recommends was good, but not great, and I am not sure a bowl of melted cheese is worth $15. The hubby loved his carnitas and my chile rellano stuffed with filet mignon was very flavorful, however, my dish had a severe protein shortage. I took a bite when it arrived and it had a piece of filet in it, I tried to share a bite with my hubby and had to destroy the entire chile searching for a piece of meat. Kind of ruined the dish since I did not want to disembowel my chile to locate the additional pieces of meat (and there were only 2 more cubes of filet in it!) Maybe the kitchen messed up? I don't think there was more than 2 oz of meat in my entree. Also, we ordered a nice bottle of wine. After we had finished, I remembered I had a Yelp check in offer for a free glass of wine. I showed the waiter and he said he would bring me a glass of the wine we had been drinking. Then I heard the manager tell him to give me house wine, which he did, but he tried to say it was the other wine. Silly to lie to me if I am about to taste it and find out! Left a bad taste is my mouth."

I'd read a few reviews and seen a write up in a local paper and was ready for Mundo. The decor in this place is very inviting.  It's elegant without being stuffy. We started with a few drinks: beer and sangria.  After we got settled in, we nibbled on seasoned chips and chunky salsa while our group waited for the rest our meal. \n\nOf the four dishes that we tried, the carnitas plate was far and away the best. The meat was tender and flavorful. Anyone ordering this dish would be satisfied with the quality. I had no issues with the other food, I was simply expecting more creative selections. Perhaps it is not fair to judge a restaurant based on my expectations of creativity, but the location, the decor, and even their website promises customers something ....more.  \"[Mundo] is a creative, collaborative effort...\" The creativity was more than evident in the lovely decor and space design, but I missed it in the food. To me, upscale Mexican food should have a twist. I can get expected, traditional, delicious fare at a number of places in the Valley for considerably less money. I thought I was paying for a variation on dishes I know very well. That was not the case. The food was good. The meat was spiced and cooked well, the beans were nicely seasoned, and the salsas were full of flavor. The \"street\" corn was a surprise. It was creamy and crunchy with a bit of tang. It was the best of our side dishes. \n\nThe desert was disappointing.  The churros and crepes were a let down. I whole- heatedly admit that I am not a desert connoisseur. But even more so than with my meal, I am looking to have an experience with my desert. PARTICULARLY at an upscale restaurant. I had no such experience here. Both selections were topped with the same caramel drizzle. The churros came with a side of more caramel and chocolate sauce. They were filled with a soft spiced mixture. I have seen this in churros before, but in spite of the meal, I was still expecting an \"elevated\" churro. Maybe a twist on the traditional churro? Or at least a traditional churro done beautifully? No such luck. In addition to sliced apple, the crepe seemed to contain a variation of the spiced creme that was in the churro. No gracias. \n\nService was solid. They were quick to take away finished plates and they made sure that we had refills. \n\nVIBE: Nuevo Warm\n\nMundo didn't blow me away, but because of its location and solid main dishes, I will likely return."

I  made my reservation well in advance, assuming that a place like this would be slammed on a Saturday night. Thanks to the directions in previous reviews, parking was a breeze (valet in the north lot - you're right out front of the restaurant). I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere inside and the service was excellent. Even though the room is very open, our table still had a nice quiet feeling. Then again, that may be because the entire restaurant has a quiet feeling (7pm on a Saturday - 2 other parties eating!). The food was very good. We got the queso flameado to start and seriously, my husband and I were practically licking the bowl to get every bit of that cheesy goodness out. For our dinner we split the chicken taquitos (solid) and the carnitas (excellent). The carnitas was probably 8-10 good sized chunks of pork in a delicious sauce, served with tortillas (corn or flour) and some veggies/guacamole on the side. The meat was really really good. \nThis is a pretty upscale place, so the entrees all average around $25. For 1 entree, 2 appetizers, and 2 glasses of wine, our total with tip was about $100.\nOne problem with Mundo: I wanted to feel like I was going \"out\" when I came here (yes, I like a little bit of a scene, especially when I'm paying big bucks). Maybe it's more of a lunch place? Happy hour crowd? Maybe the location is just too weird? Not quite sure what the issue is, but I really hope that the place catches on! In the meantime, I will keep Mundo in mind, but will not be rushing back. \nbottom line: great food, great service, cool atmosphere, high prices, no people."

I advised him the order was placed and he offered to follow up. The waiter was friendly and helpful. The Mundo Margarita's were excellent.\n\nOnce the food order was placed the waiter checked on us periodically. It was a very long wait for the food to come out. Our waiter said the wait was because the pork chop was ordered well done.\nThe pork chop was huge, enough for two and prepared as ordered. The Shrimp Diablo was spicy as described in the menu and delicious. The shrimps were served over a mix of rice and corn, very tasty.\nThe restaurant was not full but the bar packed. The bar and restaurant share the same large space. With the bar being packed the noise level was high.

I went for dinner last week, and passed it the first time I drove by since I didn't realize where it was. And because it was at night, and most of the business at the World Market Center had ended already, the restaurant was pretty empty.  There may have been another party or two present, but I barely even noticed.  There was one server serving us all night, and he was fun, although slightly (or more than slightly) off.  That didn't make for a bad experience, but just some confusing moments.\n\nOur table started off with chips & salsa, guac, and margaritas.  One of the women at my table wasn't drinking, so our server asked if she wanted to the bartender to make a non-alcoholic cocktail, which was sweet.  So she went with that.  Considering that it would probably have been an $8 drink, if she were charged for it, I think she would have been happier with just a soda or lemonade instead.  But there were great intentions there.\n\nFor dinner, I was considering a few different items off the menu, until the daily special was read off. BONE-IN RIBEYE. At that point, there was no question about what I was going to order.  I just had to choose my side. In fact, 3 of the 5 of us ordered the Ribeye! So for a side, I was debating between the sweet corn tamale and mexican style street corn.  I should have gone with my gut since I've wanted a sweet corn tamale since the last time I saw it on a menu about 4 years ago.  But since someone already ordered the sweet corn tamale, our server convinced me to get the mexican style street corn.  It wasn't bad, but it was richer than my palette prefers. I had a bite of the sweet corn tamale and it was exactly what would have satisfied my longing. But let's rewind to the actual entree! I'll just have to say that my medium rare prepared bone-in ribeye was perfect!  It's a larger portion than I could have finished in one sitting, but because it was perfect in so many ways, I really just wanted to sit there all night nibbling on it.  Perfectly cooked. Perfectly seasoned.  I ended up taking half back home, and even as a reheated left over, it was still DELICIOUS!   I'll be dreaming about that rib-eye for a while now...."

Talk about fancy!\n\nThis place doesn't remind you of your typical Mexican jaunt.  It definitely isn't supposed to give that vibe to you I guess.  Mundo is called a 'latin chic' restaurant...meaning to me 'frou-frou'.  The atmosphere is very modern and yes, very chic.  Dark woods, light tablecloths, expensive lighting, it's all there.  The crowd that hangs out there strikes me as having some money to flaunt with.  So all you gold-digger yelpers out there...this place is for you!  Ha Ha, I kid...but seriously.  If you find your next rich husband or wife there, throw a guy a bone for hooking you up!\n\nI hear that one of the investors of Mundo was a candidate running for mayor of Las Vegas several years back.  Can't remember his name off the top of my head at the moment.  Oh well.  But the night I was there for the birthday celebration it was busy because Oscar Goodman was in the house, celebrating his wife Carolyn's run for mayor.  So it was noisy, but at least the restaurant was bustling with business.\n\nOn to the food.  Verdict came back as pretty good.  It is for sure fancy Mexican/Latin food.  We sampled a bunch of things from their appetizer and dinner menu:\n\n-Fresh guacamole\n-Crispy Calamari - with cilantro serrano & sweet chipotle dipping sauce\n-Ahi Tuna Tostada - with spicy red chile vinaigrette\n-Chicen Satay - with achiote tamarind chile glaze\n-Skirt Steak Skewers - with chimichurri glaze\n-Steak and Chicken Tacos - with salsa, avocado, onion & cilantro, Chihuahua cheese\n-Chilean Sea Bass Tacos - with cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado\n\nPrices were fair for the entire menu, no entree over $35, while many of the items on the menu hovered between the $10-$18 range.  Food was fresh, my favs being the Ahi Tuna Tostada and the tacos.  Flavors were good, not traditional in any sense but modern and updated.  Good overall, although I would say that I would have enjoyed having an old school plate of authentic lengua tacos with onion & cilantro just as much.  I like simple!\n\nWe enjoyed many a cocktail as well.  I stuck with a couple of Mexican beers to compliment the food, a Modelo Especial and a Negra Modelo.  My lady tried a Mundo Mojito, and a Mundo Margarita.  Both of which she said were very good with the fresh-squeezed lime.  The premier tequila at Mundo is Alien Tequila.  This is because the owners of this restaurant are also investor/owners of the Alien brand.  Savvy, eh?\n\nService was good but a bit slow because it was packed, and much of their help seemed to go to making Oscar and his wife particularly comfortable.  Catering to the mayor, right!\n\nIf you want a fancy Latin flair night on the town, go to Mundo.  It will fit the bill nicely.  I swear, it kinda felt like J. Lo was gonna walk in with Marc Anthony at any moment!  Or Pitbull with his entourage!  \"I was playing with her....she was playing with me...next thing you know, we were playing with three...\"\n\nMe?  While I didn't mind this place, I'll stick with my Roberto's, my Cardenas, and my Komex.  That's more my crowd.  Plus, all the lengua tacos and fusion burritos I can eat on the cheap!"

I've been making annual pilgrimages to Rick Bayless's Chicago restaurants, Fronterra Grill/Topolobombo, since a coworker turned me onto them eight or nine years ago.\n\nRick Bayless is the man who has elevated Mexican food to a religious experience for foodies. When I asked my partner who is the chef de cuisine at home where he wanted to eat during our week in Vegas, he said \"See if Rick Bayless has opened a restaurant in Vegas.\"\n\nThe restaurant, Mundo,  is located in a Frank Gerry inspired complex of buildings near downtown Las Vegas called the \"World Market Center\".  The development is huge and unfortunately has white elephant written all over it.  I half-expected to see tumbleweeds blowing past the windows. I did a web search this morning and learned that the building owners had just defaulted on a half billion dollar loan.\n\nMundo itself is unpretentious, a welcome contrast to the overblown ghost town it sits in. We were there on a Monday night and the place was barely half full. We were seated and the chips arrive promptly with a red salsa. Up to this point, anybody unfamiliar with Rick Bayless would have been lulled into thinking \"this reminds me of Chevy's\" and \"maybe I should be a little wild and order the Cadillac margarita\".\n\nThen you eat your first chip with the salsa and your taste buds search the salsa database in your head and you realize you haven't had this variation. It's a thin sauce that coats your chip and imparts this smoky, roasted tomato/chili flavor. That Cadillac margarita comes and goes down easily. There is none of the aftertaste you get with high fructose corn syrup.\n\nWhat Rick Bayless does as well as any chef that I've experienced is that he plays \"flavor notes\". This is my own terminology for how I experience food. A good chef can register a flavor note or two per dish. Bayless hits several. It's the difference between hearing \"Chopsticks\" and a Bach sonata.\n\nI skipped an appetizer so I could relax and enjoy the cocktail, chips, and guacamole.  My partner had the Mundo Chopped Salad. There's probably ten ingredients with a chipotle molasses vinaigrette. I take a bite and hear music.\n\nMy entree is a chile relleno stuffed with filet mignon, potatoes, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese covered with a smoked chili sauce. Our waiter warns me that the dish can be too spicy for American tastes. Well into my Cadillac margarita, I throw caution to the window and tell him to bring it on. The chili packs a punch but it is a couple of steps in back of my threshold. The filet mignon is tender and favorable. I eat everything except for the stem of the chili. My partner has the Sarape de Pollo. It looks like a quesidilla but is anything but. It is a piece of chicken pounded to look like a tortilla then it's topped with black beans, manchego, mint chimichurri, guacamole, and pico de gallo. He raves about the dish.\n\nWe have banana empanadas and tres leche cake for dessert. I barely get a bite of the empanads from my partner but the tres leche cake holds its own in comparison. Our server, Jose, has been gracious and attentive throughout the meal. There is nothing rote about the service. He makes suggestions during the meal to heighten our experience - like adding a bite of the unused guacamole with the chile relleno or going for the Cadillac.\n\nWe leave thinking that regular Mexican food will never taste the same again. Until Bayless opens a restaurant in San Francisco, we will have to make pilgrimages to Chicago and Las Vegas."

This timing worked out very well, after much consideration.\n\nOverall, this was a great restaurant for the location (if you are attending a show) as there did not appear to be many other options. The parking lot was only a bit farther than the actual Smith Center parking area. Without that consideration, it was very average as a whole.\n\nOur server was very cordial and the staff was attentive. However, when we had finished our meal, our server seemed to disappear for a while before we were able to signal him to bring our check. \n\nOur party of three had the filet mignon, the wagyu skirt steak, and the carnitas. All of it was tasty, but definitely not what I would consider gourmet. I was expecting a much more diverse palette of taste compared to what seemed like very generic mexican flavors.\n\nI would probably not return to Mundo unless there are no other options for my next Smith Center trip."

When Market starts, I can only imagine how many of the haute interior designers are going to love eating here in the chic modern decor. \n\nI jumped at the $20 for $40 yelp 'deal'. (not sure if its still available) It was the perfect opportunity to try a new place and save myself $20. Chips & salsa to munch on were served to the table while we waited for our food. We ordered the tamales with blackened shrimp and sea scallops with a spicy chili rice. And being a lover of french fries I got a side of the Mundo fries (regular & sweet potato) to share. The meal was phenomenal!!! The tamales were some of the best I've ever had. The masa was on the sweeter side (which i love) and it meshed very well with the perfectly grilled more savory shrimp. The sea scallops were so flavorful! I'm a person who requires heavily seasoned food and this place is right up my ally.\n\nMy mother said the rice was a bit spicy. Not gonna lie, it had a bit of kick to it! But it was a heat that complimented our very rich meal. My tamales were HEAVY ON THE BUTTER!!! So I nibbled a bit more on her spicy rice.\n\nAs stuffed as we were, we got the banana empanadas to share. Hot and Cold. Creamy and Crispy. All around a satisfying dessert to finish off our meal. \n\nTIP: I hear the margaritas are awesome! And don't order the fondue unless you have 4+ people.\n\nThey could probably dress their hostess a bit nicer (her butt was about to fall out). But service was excellent! Our waiter was so sweet and more than willing to answer any questions we had.  I'll be back!"

Everything from the decor to the food, to the service, was EXCELLENT. And very reasonably-priced! It's a bit of a Hidden Gem, being located in the back of World Market Center, but that made it feel all the more special. A special reward for those who put some extra effort into seeking out something cool. Would definitely go back the next time I'm there (and probably WILL, as it's near my company's location in Las Vegas). Am looking forward to it!"

This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.\nUnfortunately we weren't able to try the food because we were verbally\nattacked by the owner, Mingo Collaso, so this review is for the\nexperience only. Here's what happened.\n\nMy husband and I (we are locals) called the restaurant at 3 pm, asking\nif they were still serving lunch. The host was very sweet and polite\nand said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had a\nbaby in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.\n\nWe arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I had\ncalled, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHER\nPERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. We\nsat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered a\ncocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. The\nbaby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food on\nits way- so far so good.\n\nThen a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, \"I\nwant you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but children\nare not allowed in the restaurant.\" I looked at him with a confused look,\nsince we had been seated there by the host, and said, \"Well, I called\nahead and asked--\" and he interrupted me and said, \"I don't care. Like\nI said, there's nothing I can do about it now.\" I said, \"are you\nasking us to leave?\" and he responded again, \"I don't care.\"\n\nI asked him, \"Why are you treating us this way? Why are you being so\nrude?\" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and I\npointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant and\nwe had called and asked. He repeated, \"I don't care,\" and turned on\nhis heels and stormed OUT of the restaurant.\n\nWe were shocked. I have never been treated this badly in a restaurant\nin my life. I worked in the service industry for ten years and have\nnever seen anyone treated like this. We had called ahead about the\nbaby, arrived when not a single person was there, ordered drinks and\nfood, and were suddenly attacked by the owner. I felt like I got\npunched in the face.\n\nHe was obviously mad at his staff for allowing us in and behaved like\na child by taking it out on us. I will strongly advise anyone who\nwants a positive service experience to not go to Mundo. The owner is\nunprofessional, unkind, and rude. I literally left in tears thanks to him."

This is my 4th visit since they opened last month (we're desperate for good restaurants downtown) and I am continuously intrigued by the descriptions on their menu. I passed on their delicious margaritas today to try sangria, which was excellent. If you had the chance to go to La Madonna, the previous restaurant owned by the chef of Mundo, you have probably tasted and enjoyed a similar version.\n\nI had the chicken tortilla soup, which I have ordered before, because it has an incredibly flavored broth that really sets it apart from other chicken tortilla soups I've had. It is seasoned with epazote which helps to give the soup a rich full-bodied taste is responsible for the deep red hue. Ian had the short rib tamale which was also delicious. The tamale dough wasn't dried out as it sometimes can be and the sweet bits of corn gave it a nice texture. The shortribs that were busting out of the husk made for a lovely presentation. \n\nOn another night we started with the queso fundido ($12), which was a combination of four melted cheeses garnished with oven roasted cherry tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and a serrano chile drizzle, and served with tortillas. I loved the use of goat cheese, the mushrooms were cooked very well, and the spicy \"drizzle\" complimented the cheese nicely. It's a heart stopper of a dish so we didn't finish it and instead opted to save room for our entree, which was a fantastic idea. We split the filet mignon of Korobuta pork with ancho chile mango glaze and chose sauteed spinach for our side ($26). Though I think it's a stretch to use the words filet mignon to describe pork tenderloin, we both thought the dish was incredibly successful. The ancho rub on the outside of the perfectly cooked pork was wonderfully intense and the accompanying sauces really set it over the top. The mango relish on top was a fantastic sweet addition that cooled the pallet from the heat. Additionally, it was a huge portion so definitely worth the price. We thought maybe they super-sized it for us since go there frequently and have unabashedly expressed our opinions to the staff on each trip (some of which could have been taken as insults but were meant to be helpful pointers since we want the restaurant to succeed), but the waiter confirmed this is the amount everyone gets. So much for feeling special. The sauteed spinach side was great as well, and unique due to the addition of roasted jalapenos. I would absolutely get both again."

            "review": "In a city with few outstanding Mexican (or TexMex) restaurants, Mundo stands out as one of the best. Located in one of the northern buildings within the World Market Center campus, it's one of the better off-Strip restaurants. Not only does it have wonderful food, it has an interior to match -- as you'd expect from a place surrounded by a design center.\n\nWith a restaurant.com gift certificate in hand, I brought my wife here to celebrate her birthday. We started off with chips and salsa and a wonderful  guacamole with diced onions and tomatoes, slices of radishes, and topped with cilantro and cotija cheese.\n\nThe chicken taquito appetizer consists of two taquitos cut in half and topped with sour cream, cotija cheese and green onions, with some lettuce and a sweet chile paste beside them. The chicken was a touch dry, but in combination with the other ingredients the flavors were excellent.\n\nMy wife's dish was a large chile relleno stuffed with cubes of filet mignon, potatoes, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese in a smoke chile sauce. If you like a little heat, this is the dish to get. The tender beef was a great vehicle to soak up the smokiness of the sauce and deliver a bold punch of flavor to the palate.\n\nI'm a sucker for some swine, so I went with the carnitas and they didn't disappoint. You'd be hard pressed to find a better version in Vegas. The succulent chunks of pork was sitting in a large mound in the center of the plate with onions and cilantro on one side, avocado pico de gallo on another, and a cucumber habanero salad on the opposite side of the plate. The pork contained a balanced ratio of mostly lean meat with a little fat here and there to offset it with some additional flavor.\n\nFor dessert we had churros. The eight small pieces were filled with a caramel sauce in the center and had some additional caramel drizzled on top. Also on the plate was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a small bowl of chocolate sauce. It would have been a great way to end the meal but they brought out one more thing after that.\n\nAn order of flan came out with a candle on top and two of the waiters sang happy birthday to my wife. I definitely wasn't expecting them to sing. I thought they only did that type of thing at TGI Friday's or place like that. But, it was much appreciated. As for the flan, it was unbelievably light, smooth and creamy with none of the eggy taste you get from lesser variations of the dish. Mom, I'm sorry to say this, but I've found flan that's better than yours.\n\nFor drinks we had a margarita and mojito, which we were happy with and we checked in through Yelp and got a free glass of wine!\n\nThe dinner was close to being perfect, but the service could have been better. Despite our waiter being very informative and friendly, he was too busy to give any of his many, many tables *great* service. But, that's more of a management and staffing issue than a reflection on him. The only other issue we had was when they cleared my wife's plate (of which she only ate about half her meal) and tossed it instead of offering to box it up.\n\nSo, aside from a couple hiccups it was a successful bday dinner. One where we were able to save a bit through restaurant.com and the Yelp check-in and still have a wonderful meal. Come to think of it, the food here is a little similar to what you would get at Mesa Grill on the strip, but much cheaper.\n\n4.5 Stars"

The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had the right amount of heat.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  Would definitely come back again.  \n\nIt is on the pricier side for Mexican food - I would say about $50 per head.  However if you want Mexican and want to avoid a super greasy hole in the wall - this place is a nice change of pace. \n\nThey do give free chips and salsa.  All very delicious."

Service was great and noise level was minimal. And that was great for us. Valet is free - just tip, and worth the few bucks rather than hoofing it. My friend said it was  busier during the day. I suppose the design / furniture stores, outlets and downtown biz folks draw a different crowd. But I would def recommend Mundo, and return, regardless of the time."

We celebrated my friends birthday here. There were about 10 of us and with that many people to serve there could be so many opportunities for failures, but there were no mishaps. In fact everyone was happy. The drinks were flowing, the food was superb and the staff was attentive and the deserts left me speechless. I had scallops over rice. It was perfect. The presentation, temperature of the food, the perfect balance of Latin seasonings and the perfect heat (spiciness). For the deserts we had an assortment of deserts that consisted of tres leches, churros, flan and apple crepes. All were good by my favorite was the churros. (my mouth just watered typing and reminiscing). What made my night also was that they had Mexican wine. I don't remember the name but it was really good. I think it was some kind of granache blend."

The octopus had great seasoning and was served on greens with some sauce on the side that this dish did not need (because it was already tasty).\n\nThe skirt steak skewers were also seasoned deliciously and came with a cup of chopped avocado. The skewers had these tender cubes of steak on them. \n\nMy friend and I shared and entree and the server was nice enough to tell the kitchen to split it on two plates for us. The sea scallops were amazing. There was a little mango garnished on the top and was on a bed of rice. \n\nDuring the night there were girls coming around doing taste tests of different margaritas with and without Grand Marnier. This was a great addition to have to our dinner. \n\nThroughout the night service was attentive and our server was sweet enough to put up with us asking her to take our pictures.

We discovered immediately the staff was not friendly, especially the deep voiced bartender. Not important if a tourist, but critical to a local who appreciates fine restaurants and has the money to spend.  We understood before we arrived that this restaurant was not a Mexican restaurant but Latin fusion food. We enjoyed our  enchiladas, but the margaritas were nothing special (too much ice and small glass for the price). Nonetheless, an above average establishment should not merely rely upon a good chef to gain repeat customers but hire friendly staff to connect with customers so they become repeat customers. As locals who appreciate fine dining, we will not return."

We had tickets to the Smith Center and this is right across the street so we thought we would get dinner group of four and then the show.  Our waiter didn't really want to be there.  He didn't explain anything, and when we asked how a dish was his response for every dish is \"it's good\" but sounded like \"eh I don't care.\"  They brought our drinks in all different types of glasses, so your first mojito in a big glass and then a tiny glass for the second but still the same price.\nThe food was not at all great for the price you are paying.  I got the filet and I asked medium however it was more well and only a tiny dab of sauce on the side, not enough to actually taste it (the sauce was the best part).  For dessert we were asked, \"what would you like for dessert?\" Yet no one had shown us a menu.  The service was slow and they were not that busy.\n\nOverall I felt like it had a lot of promise walking in, I did like the decor and the feeling when you walk in, but the service and food let me down.  :("

The chips and three different salsas were incredible, and I wish I hadn't eaten any because the queso flameado appetizer (goat cheese, spiced  roasted mushrooms, marinated tomato, and serrano chile sauce) was the best appetizer I've ever had.  (Only other one that compares was a wild nettle soup at Blue Plate in San Francisco.  You should go there, too!)   The queso dish was brought to us with corn tortillas in which to wrap everything, and my boyfriend and I looked at the size of the plate and thought, \"We'll never finish it.\"   But there wasn't a drop of anything left when we were done.\n\nHe got the pork tenderloin and, to this day  (a month after we went) he still recalls the pork fondly and sighs, wishing some would magically appear before him.  (I'm a vegetarian so I wish I could better describe his pork dish for you other than by saying, \"Yep, looks like pork to me.\")  I got roasted vegetable enchiladas and they were outstanding.  The flavors were well-balanced, they weren't drowning in cheese and other sauce, and they re-heated very well the next day (the plate, especially after the queso appetizer, was too big to consume in one sitting).  Oh, and we loved the margaritas.  They tasted exactly like margaritas, not overly sugary sour mix.  That's kind of rare, we've learned.\n\nThe service was also impeccable.  Everyone was so attentive and professional.  I kind of wanted to tell them that we weren't important enough guests to be attended to so.\n \nAs for the tab, it's priced for a nice dinner out -- for a romantic evening, out-of-town guests, or just a good frickin' meal -- and I can't recommend it enough."

My partner loved his enchilada.  We also had the Crisp Calamari for appetizer which was cooked very well.  The service was exceptional.  They accommodated our dietary needs (we are pescatarians).  Because they knew it was for my birthday, they also gave us a dessert: the bread pudding.  It was great.  This has to be the best one I had ordered here in Vegas.  I highly recommend the restaurant.  It is definitely a nice place to have a quiet night and enjoy food."

            "review": "I have to agree with others that while the food is fantastic, the service is horrible.  We made a 5:45 reservations last Saturday before a 7:30 show at the Smith Center.  When we arrived we saw a table that was likely ours (party of 6) that looked ready yet we weren't seated for another 15 minutes.  It then took about 20 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us.  It was very busy, which we understood, but we also made it very clear that we were going to a show at the Smith Center and needed to get served and be out by 7.  I even explained this when making the reservation and I was assured that a 5:45 reservation would \"leave plenty of time\" to eat and get to the show.  Maybe they should consider increasing their staff to serve before Smith Center events since they are the closest restaurant to the venue.  We understand they are busy before shows  but they have to know that anyone who dines at 5:30 pm on a Saturday probably has plans to head to a show and they should do everything in their power to get them served in a timely fashion.  By 7:15 the place was completely cleared out, leaving only our table in the entire restaurant.  We basically had to tackle the lady to get our check and get over there and in the end we made it with just minutes to spare.\n\nAlso, just an FYI and something that I didn't see mentioned here--they offer a free Alien Margarita with a Yelp check in, but they only allow one per table.  We had three couples and it was only after we checked in that they mentioned that.  No biggie, coupons usually say that they only allow one per table and we were getting wine anyway, but I figured I'd mention it since I don't see it mentioned anywhere else."

Constantly kept water glasses filled and hey who can complain about a free glass of wine?! (yelp check in offer!)\n\nBut the real joy came from the amazing balance of flavors that each dish encapsulated. We started with the guacamole. And wow what a start. Easily the most flavorful guac I've ever had. There is a little spicy kick to it which kept my hand reaching for the chips for more of the hurts so good flavor. Then I got the Mexican risotto which was also yummy along with the tortilla soup which they pour  from the pot to the bowl table side. The real way to win me over is amazing dessert. Two words. Banana empanadas. They had just the right amount of crisp to them and the chocolate ice cream blended with the banana and the cream sauce effortlessly like a match made in heaven. My taste buds were euphoric as I took in each bite.  Hopefully you one day find yourself here in the same state of joy as I was!\n\nOne Tid bit is that they have karaoke on Monday nights which makes it much less intimate but also fun in its own way. I think it goes from 5:30-9:30."

While the quality of \"Mom and Pop\" Mexican has had a tremendous surge over the past decade, the higher-end has largely gone unrepresented, particularly the Yucatan region. Robert Solano has changed that. A lot of the menu comes from his roots (he is from Merida), and there is sunshine in those Yucatecan influences that really bring vibrant flavors to the plate. With a lot of citrus, and habaneros being used to accent the usual assortment of chile's, the end results are vibrant, and remind me of the kind of cuisine I had grown so fond of while doing some projects in Mexico, but have not found on Las Vegas menus. A shame that the location does not create more visibility; but absolutely worth seeking out."

Once you enter and take in the decadent decor you know you've arrived somewhere special.  I usually opt to sit at the bar so I can have personal time with the mixologists, because my friends call me \"special\" when I order my favorite libation and not in the good way...you know who you are.  I just like custom tequila concoctions and I'm never disappointed here. The list of their specialty drinks is awesome and it you're a true tequila drinker over time, like many visits, you should try them all. All made with premium tequilas and fresh fruit juices.  Mundo also owns their very own brand, Alien Tequila.\n\nI think two of the best times to go is during happy hour or before your show at the Smith Center.  An absolute favorite menu item is the Ahi Tuna tar tar on a crispy tostada, drizzled with an outer worldly chili oil.  Excellent!   A must have is for those that like it hot is the camorones diablo as it brings the heat and so much flavor!  And, can't forget the scallops as they are seasoned then seared to perfection every time placed atop of cilantro rice.  A great happy hour item to try is the vegetable quesadilla, packed full of seasoned sauteed vegetables and gooey cheese, yum.  Great place to meet and greet as the location is adjacent to the World Market Center which always has something going on."

We all got super excited when we saw \"Mexican Corn\" on the menu.  To be fair, this is out great expectation to another experience we had in NYC with mexican corn at a little hole in the wall place...AND this is Rick Bayless IT MUST BE EVEN BETTER! (wait for it....)\n\nThe \"MEH.\"  (Would have been aokay at 3 stars)\n1.  The sangria was tasty, none of us could get a buzz off of it.\n2.  The Mexican corn came out...and it was waaaay too rich.  There was waayyy too much cream/cheese in it to really enjoy it.  Had it been a bit lighter, we would have inhaled it.\n3.  Carnitas...had better.  RB didn't revolutionalize or improve upon it. Sadly...meh.\n\nThe Grr.... (minus the 1 star)\nService:  overall all the servers were friendly.  However dropped a few balls which wasn't such a huge deal...but don't lie to me about a $2 cup of coffee.\n\n- Initially Jose, our server was friendly, jabs here and there (perfect in sparring with these group of girls).  However as the night wore on...the attentiveness wore off.\nHe forgot my corn.  Come to find out, he served it to another friend at the other side of the table.  Not such a big deal.\n- Then came dessert.  I asked for a cup of coffee with a plate of Churros for the table.  The churros came, we ate it, it was okay, we sat there -- no coffee.\n- Meanwhile, a table he was familiar with sat down next to us and he proceeds to yak them up, even pulling out his phone for a slide show and having a complate conversation with the table.\n- When he finally got back to our table 20 minutes later, I looked at him and he realized he never brought my coffee and proceeded with the following:\n --   JOSE:   Oh! I am so sorry!  I won't charge you for it, it is removed it but let me give you a cup to go.\n --   ME:  Forget it..  Just take it off the bill\n --   JOSE:  Please. Let me buy you a cup of coffee.\n --   ME:  No, forget it.\n --   JOSE:  You sure?  Okay...well here's the bill, no rush\nMy friend took the bill and muttered to another friend \"ooh...the coffee is still on here\"\n\nNow.  Let me set something straight.  It isn't the $2 he charged for my coffee.  Rather , why make the big gesture of falling on the sword with \"I am SO SORRY! I TOOK IT OFF! LET ME BRING YOU A CUP TO GO!\"   Had that been it, I would have been fine, but no....he lies about a $2 cup of coffee..."

I was hands-down ready to give this place a 1 star, but thanks to the bartender Mundo gets a 4 star!  \n\nUpon arrival, Jadira and I were very impressed.  Just from the outside this place looked really classy.  Once we got inside we noticed there was a hostess stand, but no hostess to be found.  I stopped a busser that was coming by and asked if we should just seat ourselves.  He seemed a bit confused and told us to go ahead and seat ourselves and that the server would be right with us.  20 minutes later and we were still sitting there... not a single peep from anyone.  We noticed that there was indeed a purpose for that hostess stand because a hostess had magically appeared.  About 10 minutes in to our wait, a large party arrives and was sat right next to us.  The server totally ignored us and assisted the large party first (accommodating them with water and menus).  At this point, I was getting a little frustrated so I approached the bartender behind the bar.  I had explained that no one had even talked to us and that I was interested in ordering.  She apologized and basically became our server while still running the busy bar.  To make a long story short, thank you to the bartender for saving the night!  After the actual server noticed the bartender talking to us, he finally came over and lit our candle and asked us if we cared for anything to drink.  We told him no thanks that the bartender was already taking care of us. \n\nWe visited Mundo during Happy Hour and was very impressed.  The drinks that we had were amazing (especially that Martini in my opinion).  The pricing wasn't too bad either.  We definitely plan on returning.\n\nWhat we ordered:  \n * Sangria - I'm not a huge Sangria fan ,but this was good\n * Mundo Martini-  I seriously could have had 3 more of these easy.\n *  Mundo Fries-  Sweet Potato Fries... cooked perfectly!  These were addicting!!\n * Calamari-  We are huge Calamari fans and Mundo is definitely in our top 3 picks.\n\nPros:\n * The ambiance was very impressive.  We absolutely loved it.  It's alot bigger than it looks too.\n *  Live DJ spinning music.  I don't know if this was because it was First Friday, but definitely had good vibes throughout.\n *  Really good Happy Hour.  All I got to sample (food-wise) were appetizers, but if this was any indication of what the rest of the menu has to offer, then I'm sure I'm in for a treat when I go to enjoy the full Mundo dining experience.\n * Amazing Service (from the Bartender)... Thank you sooo much!\n\nCons:\n* Bad Service (missing hostess and didn't get acknowledged for nearly 30 minutes!\n\nOverall:\n  I really only had one complaint and it was a big one, but once we did get service and received our food, we were instant fans.  I can't wait to come here and try other things from the menu.  I'll be back and will surely update my review once I am able to do so.  \n\nTips:\n * Try the Calamari (I'm not sure what the sauces are ,but both were really good).\n * Once it gets warmer, there is outside seating."

The decor is very chic and feels relaxing and inviting and the staff is super friendly. It was my birthday and we had a coupon from travelzoo.com for 2 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert for $55. We paid for tax ($10) and tip ($25) so dinner was $90. I had a margarita and hubs had a mojito, both were good. For our appetizer, we had the skirt steak skewers, they were good. The skewers were served with a chimichurri sauce and a side of marinaded avocados and a kind of latin cole slaw. I had the sea bass, it was delicious. The fish was cooked well and came with a jalapeno and a roma tomato on top and was served with potatoes. It  was cooked in parchment paper and had great flavor. My husband ordered the scallops, they were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Our dessert was the banana empanadas, they were amazing. The empanadas came with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce. I would highly recommend the empanadas. Since it was my birthday, they brought me a free shot of tequilla. I would not hesitate to eat here again and Mundo would be a great place to bring friends, family, or clients. Mundo was not busy for dinner on a Thursday night but that is not surprising since it is located in the World Market Center which closes at 6. I would like to try their happy hour."

I think that each person should always keep in mind that one single visit to a certain place does not always warrant a review, hence the reason I always choose to try a place more then once before writing a review.\n\nHaving said that, here is my review.\n\nDecor:\n\nThis place is a beautiful mix of lights and mirrors, that bring about an atmosphere of intimacy and chic splendor.  The lamps are absolutely beautiful, dangling from the ceiling giving you a feeling that they're almost floating.  The mirrors around the room help make the room even more cozy by providing reflecting light and the ability to see around the room as well.  It provides ample seating, with areas for socializing, dining or having an intimate dining experience for you and a loved one!\n\nService:\n\nThe hosts/ess are all courteous and well mannered.  I've always been promptly seated, and on nights that I know are busy (Lunch, Weekend Dinners), I've been smart enough to make a reservation, and have always had my table ready by the time I arrived!  The servers are very knowledgeable about the food their restaurant carries, and are always willing to provide ample information or asked for opinion.  \n\nFinally the Food...................\n\nWhere to start!  When I say that the food is phenomenal, I feel as if it doesn't do the food justice!  I think I've just about tried every plate on the menu (to include seasonal items), and let me just say that Robert (the Chef) is incredible.  He's able to capture such amazing flavors in his food, and bring about an explosive delight that just leaves you mesmerized in tantalizing flavor.\n\nThe tamales, are made to perfection, being moist and firm, while still providing a softness and deliciousness that rivals even my mothers kitchen!\n\nThe tacitos (app menu), while not huge are just the right amount for two people to share (as are most their apps), and are accompanied by a delightful mix of onion and lettuce with a lime spritz on the side.\n\nThe queso flameado is a flavorful concoction that is not overly spicy and just the right mix of cheese and spice!\n\nThe steak is made to perfection (to a persons choosing of course), and when I say nothing compares to this dish, I seriously mean it.\n\nThese are just some of my favorites, I could seriously go on about each one for days, but in order to avoid getting blisters on my fingers from all this typing, i recommend you try this place out and see for yourself!\n\nLastly Pricing:\n\nThis place can obviously cost a pretty penny if you're going in with the intent of ordering a lot of dishes, however, for those thrifty eaters, you can definitely find a variety of affordable items, that will not only provide you with a decent amount of food, but also an amazing dining experience.\n\nNOTE:  If you like alcohol, by all means try any of the house specials and be prepared for an extraordinary drink!"

Meat, beans, rice, and tortillas, right?  Wrong!  \n\nMundo's is located in the World Market Center.  Walking to Mundo was exciting in it self.  It was like we were in a new city.  Never been to the World Market.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and many of the tables were full.  They also have a full bar.  Looks like if all the tables were removed it could be a good place for a party.\n\nI'll start with the good stuff.  The tables had 2 baskets of chips and salsa.  The baskets were always kept full which was nice.  We also, checked in on Yelp and there was a free glass of wine....naize!  The food was delicious!  I had the carnitas plate.  The pork had such good flavor and was seasoned perfectly with a little bit of sweetness.  The plate also came with avocado pico de gallo, cucumber habanero salad and tortillas.  The cucumber habanero salad really stuck out.  It was seasoned with bit of a vinegar and I loved it! Overall I would have to say 2 thumbs up to the food.\n\nNow, the annoying.  When the server asked for our order he didn't even think of trying to help us decide since it was our first time. When we got our food I remembered that it came with tortillas.  I asked the server where were my tortillas.  He answered by putting his hand on a napkin right next to me which was wrapped around the tortillas. It would have been easier to just tell me that they were in the napkin when you served me my meal. It's a little different when your with a party of 8 but, if it were just me and my wife I would have been more annoyed by our servers slip ups.\n\nOver all it was a great time.  We had great company, a fun environment, some drinks, and great food!  I would have given this place a 5 but, the service was a little off.  Might of been just that one time.  But, if we go again I'll make sure to do an update on the service.  I would definitely go again!"

Mundo not only fills that void, but it offers a semi-extended happy from 3pm-7pm (Monday-Friday).  The only catch is that you have to sit at the bar.  Sitting at the bar didn't bother me at all, because the service was on point and their bar area is beautiful.  \n\nWe decided to be thrifty by arriving at 2:45pm.  We sat at the bar, ordered off the lunch menu, and waited for 3PM (Happy hour) to roll around to order drinks.  That way we got a discount on cocktails.  \n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa were pretty good.  I had a mojito ($7HH) and my girl had the paloma ($7HH).  My girlfriend is cuban and deemed the mojito \"too sweet\", but I enjoyed it.  The paloma tasted of grapefruit and tequila, just as it's described.  Both were very refreshing on a warm day in Las Vegas.\n\nThe food was muy delicioso and just the right portion size too.  I had the carnitas which came accompanied with tortillas, fresh lettuce, guacamole, and fresh tomatoes.  The carnitas (pork) was a bit caramelized and had a subtle sweetness.  I made my own tacos with the ingredients and I was plenty satisfied.  My girl had the sarape de pollo.  It was fairly good.  Actually, I was really impressed by how flat they make the chicken breast, it almost looked like a tortilla. They place the flattened chicken on the bottom of the plate and cover it with the toppings (black beans, guacamole, etc.).  \n\nAll in all, after a couple of drinks and two entrees our bill came to around $60.  The service was great and we had a good time.  I'd like to visit again....maybe before or after a show at the Smith Center.  Adios!\n\nP.S. They have a vegetarian menu and they serve brunch on Sundays!"

We started out with the skirt steak skewers, nicely charrerd and perfectly cooked with the best chimichurri glaze I've ever had.  For entrees, she had the vegetarian quesadilla, with a real garden basket of ingredients inside.

Dinner was excellent, but on our way in we noticed a sign for their brunch specials on the weekend. Brunch is perhaps my favorite meal of the day, so it was decided --- Mundo brunch for my birthday :-)\n\nWe had a table of 6 I think, and were one of only a couple groups in the whole place. I'd love to see this place stay, so I'm hoping more of you will give it a try!\n\nSo first things first. Bottomless drinks. For $20 you get either bloody marys or mimosas (in several flavors far more interesting than just OJ). Our server gave us the great idea of one person ordering one, the other ordering the other, and we could mix-match to our hearts desire! Genius since I love bloody marys, but bottomless could weigh you down after awhile. \n\nFood - I got the Benedict Mexicano --- DELISH.\nJalapeno corn bread instead of english muffin.\nPork carnitas instead of canadian bacon/ham.\nGreen chile hollandaise instead of normal heavy hollandaise. \nGenius. It was so good, it makes me wonder why Mr. Benedict didn't just make it this way from the beginning.  \n\nNormally I have order envy, where no matter how happy I am with what I order, I covet what my neighbors have. Not this time. I didn't want to trade, I didn't want to share.  I can't even tell you what the other 5 people at my table ordered, but they all loved it too, so I don't think you can go wrong :)"

You'd expect service to be top notch, but unfortunately it was confused more than anything. We had three different people check on us, but there was no communication between them. Odd, but on to the food. We started with chips and salsa and guacamole. The guac was simple, fresh and tasty. Next, we ordered the shrimp tamale and carnitas. The tamale was very good with chipotle glazed shrimp. The carnitas, however, were a big disappointment. There was more fat than meat, the flavor was bland seemingly tasting of wine more than anything else. I missed that tender succulent porkiness you usually get with carnitas. These were such a miss it was tempting to run over to Casa Don Juan to satisfy the craving. \n\nI tend to favor authentic Mexican but I did like Mundo (aside from the carnitas) better than other upscale Mexican restaurants I've tried -  Dos Caminos, Isla, and Agave."

They tell you about the specials when they give you the menu - they had 4 additional options that night.\nFavorite thing about this place - Margaritas. They use Agave, silver tequila and lime juice...so simple but it's my favorite. \nThe salsa and guacamole is ok. The salsa doesn't have a special taste nor did the guac. I love spicy guac or to have the option at least. \n\nFor dinner - \nSweet Chipotle glaze shrimp tamale. LOVED this! I loved the spiciness of the red sauce. Very good sweet/spicy mix and very creamy corn for the tamale.\n\nSkirt steak - Anytime I can get arrachera, I will do so. This was a very good dish with a side of sauteed spinach with onions and jalapenos. I'm not sure how long they marinade it for, but arrachera usually has a ton of flavor in it. This one was good and tender, just not as much flavor as I'm used to. \n\nMy friend had one of the specials - Pan seared scallops on a bed of rice pilaf. It also was very good. The scallops where very tender and not rubbery tasting like a lot of places around here serve. \n\nOverall, I liked this place a lot.

I enjoyed it more with the chips, since it reminded me of an upscale version of nachos. \n\nOne of my favorite entrees there is the short rib enchilladas.

Very tasty and definitely a unique amazing spicy flavor to it! If you like spicy this dish is for you!  It come along with a sauce that is delicious and some  mixed greens  and grilled veggies which give the appetizer an amazing flavor.   If you are not a fan of spicy we were told you can let them know so it is not made as spicy, but trust me when I say good as made by the Chef!   \nNext we shared a few other dishes.  We had the Sweet Chipotle glaze shrimp tamale , Pork Chop, Ahi Tuna Tostada and  the street corn.\n\nThe sweet chipotle glaze shrimp tamale  I had never had before!  My  friend had and he recommended it.  OMG  it made the \" I MUST HAVE  LIST\"  perfect combination of sweetness form the tamale and the grilled Shrimp in glazed in chipotle is perfect. \n Pork Chops perfectly cooked layed on mashed potatoes. \n Ahi Tuna Tostada I had never tried either. Again, another dish that is a a must with a good amount of spicy. \n\nLast, but not least.  The Street corn is always a treat. \n\nOh I forgot to finish my story on valet  guy.  It seem they always leave early.  He walked around giving keys back to customers as they were having dinner.   Which tends to ruin the dinner experience.  Mundo was not closing as 3 other tables still were sat after we were given our keys. It seems this happens a lot more often than I would like it to.  I under stand if only 1 or two cars are left and the place is closed. However when people are still eating and you have to stop to get your keys, tip them( lucky I had a $5 otherwise would need to ask for change)  I am don ranting about Valet.

We destroyed the complimentary chips and salsa.  Ordered the Calamari and guacamole. Calamari was meh...I would pass on that. \nGuacamole was fresh and creamy with a little spicy bits in it (recommend).\nThen the main course came. Wow. WOW!\nSkirt steak with chimichurri was bomb.com (is that cool to say still/was it ever?). The steak (ordered medium) melts in your mouth with the right amount of char and pink on the inside.  Flavor profile was like an explosion of amazingness in your mouth. Not too much cilantro to over power the classic taste of the steak and an avocado mix on top perfectly balanced with the flavors of the steak. \nI chose the mexican street style corn as my side.

I guess it didn't help when we started the meal by ordering our free glass of wine with yelp check in. BUT STILL! cmon man, i understand gratuity is now included with a large party BUT we can still add more if you give us exceptional service! \nAlso, they were grabby with our seemingly empty plates.

The decor composed Moroccan style lanterns fused with gothic velvet curtains. Great for a romantic dinner for 2 or even a catching up with a group of friends. \n\nThis one will definitely will be on the repeat visit list!"

So, my husband and I decided on this place for our date night last night.  The shuttle from the valet parking lot was interesting, not necessary, but a nice touch.\nWe were able to immediately order our drinks upon sitting, but while he was shortly provided with his soda, I waited ten plus minutes for my mojito.  It was mighty tasty, tho!\nWe ordered the skirt steak skewers.  There were three for $12.  While we enjoyed them, there was just not a lot of them.  Since I was starting to worry that this might be one of those places where my husband leaves hungry, I let him have two of the skewers.\nI had the pork tenderloin with mexican rosotto and my husband had the chicken enchiladas.  My food was so fantastic that I didn't offer to share except for the rosotto.  My husband ate all of his enchiladas and didn't want my rosotto.  Since I decided to take half of my food home, we decided we could \"share\" a dessert.  (Meaning I had three bits)  We had banana and something empanadas.\nThe food was really delicious, but minus my two mojitos, our bill was still over $70.  I just don't think it was $70 good.  \nI would consider trying it for lunch, since I work downtown.  I just don't think I would return for dinner, hence the 3 stars."

The waiter talked so softly we had to lean in to hear him.  They were supposed to bring the birthday cake out whole for the candle blowing ceremony and then take it back and cut it, but without permission, because of time, brought it out already cut with a candle in a piece for the birthday girl.  The waiter seemed upset when we asked that he bring out the piece on top that said, \"Happy Birthday\".  I ordered a drink, and in 20 minutes, when I still did not have it, the waiter came back and took my order again, and THEN I got it within about 10 minutes.\n\nThat aside, the ambiance was fantastic.  Low lighting, but not too low.  The filet rellano was worth every penny.  Absolutely delicious!  Highlight of the evening.  The ahi tuna tostada was different and good.  Steer clear of the calamari though.  It was bland and more like slimy Long John Silvers - actually LJS is a little better.  Guacamole was delicious.  Chips were good and water was kept full.  The mojitos are not too sweet and not too mint-y.  Perfect."

The wait staff is always there to refill drinks. The recommendations by the staff helped make my second visit a success. There is actual flavor to the food I ordered, not just spicy, it was both. \n\nThe steaks were excellent, which is a different experience from most Mexican restaurants I have been to. The price per entree reflects that this is a higher end restaurant.\n\nI would not advise paying $24 for a shrimp tamale however. That dish should be around $14 max. The street corn and Mexican risotto are great side items. I ordered the Mexican risotto on both of my visits.\n\nIf you are looking for a premium meal before or after an event in the World Market Center, Downtown Las Vegas or The Smith Center, do consider Mundo."

I was encouraged by word of mouth to make a reservation due to how busy this place always is. When we arrived we used available valet, and quickly went inside. It was a little busy but not what we expected, really died out once theater crowd had left for show time. We were seated promptly and had drinks ordered and salsa and chips right away, big plus. We had the Avocado dip which was pricey for the amount we got and not too impressive as pictures and other yelpers stated. I had the Carnitas and they were very good and my side of Street Corn was amazing. My wife Josie had a chicken special that she found was really good. Desert was Cherros that were good except for the filling in the middle. We also had the crepes they were good but a little too thick for our tastes. While having desert Valet brought me my keys, business was slow and they were closing down. It was 8:45 PM. Overall a good meal good service. For the prices I expected more."

The location is a little strange but the decor is great. The last time I got the Wagyu steak fajitas that were delicious.

We even called a couple hours before our dinner to ask to move our reservation to an hour later. She was extremely accommodating and made the change. \n\nWe were promptly seated upon arrival and told that a reality tv show would be filmed near our table later in the evening. She wanted to give us the option of being out of the line of the cameras - no way!  This will be fun to watch!  Really hip room and we appreciated that the music wasn't so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation like so many other Vegas restaurants. \n\nOur waiter was friendly and attentive. Our drink orders were filled immediately. He made sure we were aware of their evening special. The staff made sure our water glasses were never empty. \n\nOur food arrived in a timely manner....and it was outstanding!!!  My husband had the prime filet mignon with the Mexican risotto side. I had the strip steak with the Mexican street corn side. Steaks were lean and seasoned and cooked perfectly. The sides were delicious. We wished we had room for dessert!\n\nDefinitely give yourself some time to figure out the parking if you've never been to this area before. We ended up parking in the World Market parking garage - the entrance was on the back side of the building next to a loading dock area. Mundo's entrance is in a courtyard between the buildings. \n\nWe are so happy to add this restaurant to our best of Vegas list!  We look forward to coming back! Thanks Mundo!"

Also, the quality to price ratio is awesome.

We went out of our way as the vegetarian selection looked very good and I like to support non-casino restaurants.\n\nThe crooner that night was extremely loud. So loud that we simply just stopped trying to talk to each other and stared blankly for the entire meal. I can't believe that this would ever attract people to come to the restaurant, but it certainly makes me not ever want to go back. We figured the food would be excellent, but we were very wrong. The red and green enchiladas was best described as a big bowl of cheese. I ordered the pork tenderloin. For $28, I got four pieces of meat and a basket of fries. The meat was OK, but I guess I was expecting more for $28 at a non-strip restaurant. Jose the waiter was very good, so he earns the extra star."

The restaurant has a classy, but relaxed vibe with most patrons probably having a pre-Smith Center-show meal, because it got a little empty at 7:00pm.  I was a little wary of how the service would be based on other Yelp reviews, but our waiter was very attentive throughout the meal.  We started with the sangria (refreshing), shared the chopped salad (nice and light) which was halved for us, and I had the shrimp tamale as my entree:  delicious!  We finished the meal with the chocolate Tres Leches cake which came with vanilla ice cream.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and will definitely return.  \nBTW, it was my first time at the World Market Center itself, and there is some nice architecture going on there!"

Although off the beaten path a bit, the restaurant itself has beautiful atmosphere - upscale and dimly lit. You must drive or take a cab here as it is not in walking distance to anything.\n\nThe margaritas were hand crafted and delicious and chips/salsa/guacamole fresh and flavorful.\n\nOur table started with two appetizers which we shared amongst 6 of us - the Mundo chopped salad was delicious - made with tomatoes, cucumbers, apple, Maytag bleu cheese, and a sweet/spicy vinagarette dressing. We also had chicken nachos. I'm not a nachos person but these were quite good.\n\nFor dinner, I chose the chilean sea bass which was sweet and spicy - glazed with a jalapeno citrus sauce and it was over vegetables - fresh sautee of assorted long beans. Co-diners went with more traditional Mexican dishes - chicken enchiladas which were delicious, filet mignon chile relleno, quesadillas - all very tasty and not overly greasy or buried in cheese.\n\nWe happened to be there on karaoke night. Had I not been with clients, I would've had some tequila shots and joined in. Since I wasnt in that mind-frame, the karaoke was borderline annoying.\n\nAll in all, a good choice - gourmet Mexican is how I would classify it."

I would need to come back to give it a second try. \n\nWell for this try, we had the Queso Flameado which is like cheese fondue served corn tortilla. The cheese combo was really good, along with the other ingredients they put in it. Came with 3 tortillas.  \nThen for entrees we had Carnitas and Seabass. The carnitas was flavorful and sweet, reminded me of coca-cola braised pork. The portion was rather big which was great but again was served with 3 tortillas (note to the restaurant, please give at least 4 tortillas with the apps and entrees) The Seabass was wrapped in parchment and seasoned with spices. Cooked well but not my favorite because I'm not used to the spices. I'm more of a truest with fish - they need to be simply prepared so I can taste the fish.  \n\nFor dessert we had flan and it was really good but I wasn't a fan of the strawberries and fruit syrup with the caramel sauce. \n\nAbout the service, the server was nice but seemed a bit casual compared to the fine dining ambiance. I would have preferred a more professional and informed server. Maybe that's the style of the restaurant but it didn't fit. \n\nAgain, I need to come back and plan to because they have quite a bit of selection of beef entrees that looked good."

But the love just wasn't there tonight.\n\nIt took a while for us to order our dishes and to hear even what the specials were tonight. It basically took at least 15 minutes to wait for our waiter to come around and take our order.\n\nI got the roasted chicken dish with tamales which was excellent - great flavours. Paired with the sweet tamales, and I was in heaven. My husband ordered the filet which was only alright. The side of mushroom didn't appear to be \"wild\" at all - yup! $8 for a small side of plain old button mushrooms. Would definitely not recommend this side.\n\nAnother member of the table ordered the tortilla soup and taquitos which she said were both good.\n\nUnfortunately, the carnitas was a rather poor compared to the other dishes on the table. Like a previous reviewer noted - some appeared dry. \n\nWe did order the bread pudding which was fair at best. Nothing special.

We got to the near empty place on Sat at 3:05 and were disappointed in missing lunch and didn't fuss since it was our fault we were 5 minutes late.  Location was very odd and out of the way.  Decor was nice, only 3 other groups eating which should have been a sign of things to come.\n\nI had a beer while wife had a sangria which was pretty good.  Soon after sitting down store bought chips and 1 type of salsa arrived. Yes they were that bad. Next we had queso flameado and it was the highlight of the meal except for the store bought tortillas that came with it.\n\nFor entrees wife ordered vegetable chile relleno, I was on the fence and asked waiter what he thought of the filet mignon chile relleno.  He said it was one of his favorites and \"challenged\" me to try it. I accepted the challenge.\n\nWhat was delivered left us feeling ripped off.  The sauce on the veg chilli relleno was ok but the filling was just mush.  Mine had a different sauce which was very odd but the kicker was the meat.  There is no way that was filet mignon, it was cubed chuck or similiar and tough.  My wife said the consistency reminded her of dog food and I hate to say it but I agree with her. We paid $26 for 1 small chilli relleno stuffed with tough meat and mushy vegetables. Service was ok until after we were done eating. Waiter asked if we were done and if we wanted dessert. I said no dessert and we are done. Took another 10 minutes to come back to table and asked if we wanted check. I said we are done just like before.  I guess he was too busy with the 3 other tables.\n\nOur feelings are if you are going to charge gourmet prices then you better deliver the goods and they missed the mark for us."

Filet Mignon Chile Relleno - Outstanding.  Light, melted cheese, tender beef, carmelized mushrooms.\n3.  Sea Scallops - Four scallops, crusted with chilie adobe on the outside and cooked perfectly.  Not overly spicy but it does have a good kick.  Spanish rice which was flavored with corn kernels and zucchini.  Well done!\n4. Banana Empanadas - Average.  Two small empanadas swimming in a cream caramel flavored sauce.  Slightly sweet but not overpowering.  However, the empanadas had softened.  Would have loved more banana's and vanilla speck ice cream, less caramel cream sauce.\n5.  Ice Tea and Full Bar - Ice tea was slightly bitter.  Either it was steeped too long or had sat out too long."

I could've eaten 4 of them stacked on each other as a meal!\n\nFor entrees, I had the Chilean Sea Bass and he had the filet stuffed Chile Rellano; and elote for a side.\nThe sea bass was soooooo beautifully presented. All wrapped up like a delicious gift!\nHis filet was perfectly juicy and tasty; and went very well with the spiciness of the Chile. The sauce added extra kick and spice to the dish.\nThe elote was elote. My FAVE, as always. You can never get Mexi corn wrong.\n\nWe were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert. Which I would love to come back for.\n\n\nWhat's even more great about this place is that they are vegan/vegetarian friendly. I was excited to tell my roommate who is dating a vegan/vegetarian.\n\n\nAll in all, I'm excited for more date nights here. Very romantic and intimate!"

Loved the decor, and the staff was extremely attentive and polite. Our party of 4 shared 2 appetizers--chicken taquitos and a steak quesadilla. Both were fantastic.  I ordered the pork tenderloin with mango salsa and my husband had the wagyu steak; we shared the Mexican street style corn. It was all delicious, cooked perfectly, and nicely presented. I look forward to eating at Mundo's again."

This is not a Hash House (no offense but who can eat that much) second the quality and taste are right on point. One example is the Chicken Tostada. Not what you think but really good. The skin is charred in a way that gives it an amazing flavor and texture.  Everything I have tried works for me. I have only been here for lunch so it's time to ring the dinner bell on this gem. The decor is really nice as well.  As others have stated finding it might be your biggest challenge but the valet is literally steps from the door. It's in the World Market Center on the first floor."

            "review": "First of all, I probably never NEVER ever EVER would have discovered this restaurant without yelp's assistance. Thanks for that yelp. This Mexican restaurant is tucked away in the World Market Center, which most people in Vegas are clueless about anyway. I strolled in here on a Saturday afternoon w/ a friend around 2. Even though the showrooms of the center were closed for the weekend, Mundo had a few groups of patrons. From the moment you walk in you just feel cool. You already feel like you aren't in Vegas from the outside. There is chic (and comfortable) furniture, trendy mirrors, CNN on the plasma, and a pleasant vibe. Its fancy, but not so fancy it makes you feel like you have to use your most prim and proper behavior. The waiters were very attentive, the menu is easy, drinks come in large wine type glasses, and you get complimentary tortilla chips and sauces. \n\nI had the \"Chicken Tostida Salad\" and my friend just got some guacamole (its ridiculously priced at $9, but its mashed fresh to order). Although I expected a larger portion of the salad, it was divine! In all honesty, best salad I've ever tasted. The chicken was roasted to perfection and very tender. Be warned, it is spicy, but I probably should have expected that. For iced tea (unsweetened) and a salad, my order came to $17.30. The waiters were very friendly and stopped by our table multiple times to check on us.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and get some more. As its not at all noticeable from the outside, its definitely a local surprise that everyone should experience."

If you want a heavier fare they have the skirt steak in soft tacos.  They have great dinner entrees as well but pricey.  You can buy coupons from restaurant.com where you can get a $20 voucher for $2.  Completely worth it. But you can only use the restaurant.com vouchers for dinner.\n\nThe drinks menu is extensive.  They seem to push Tobin James wines pretty heavily but I don't mind because their wines are great. Happy hour is fun to go to because they have the same delicious foods but at a cheaper price as well as the drinks.  Their sangria is to die for.  The staff is knowledgeable about wines and enjoy making recommendations.  I usually go for lunch but the dinner ambiance was great as well.  A downtown gem."

            "review": "Three friends and I came in for dinner before a show at The Smith Center; I think it's safe to assume the majority of the other patrons were doing the same thing. The show was at 7:30 and we got there just after our 6:00 reservation. Well, two of us got there--the other two were running a bit late but we went ahead and ordered drinks & guacamole. The service was good; they were quite busy and our server let us know we needed to order within the next 5 minutes if we wanted to make our show. We appreciated his letting us know. \n\nThe ambiance is nice as well, and the location obviously is the biggest plus for show peeps. I had brunch here a few months back and it was reasonably priced and decent--plus I think at the time, we were just happy to find ANYPLACE that could fit us in for brunch before a matinee. There is a dearth of decent restaurants around the Smith Center. \n\nThis is probably the main reason Mundo does so well; the dinner menu is quite expensive, the cocktails not much better than Strip prices and the food is okay at best, IMO. \"Upscale Mexican.\" Whatever. I think the word \"upscale\" is just a good reason to charge more.  \nThe chips and salsa are good and the cocktails were fine also. The guacamole was really really spicy-- to the point that two members of our party couldn't even eat it. Really? It's guacamole. It's pretty basic and tasty without you trying to all fancy it up with your extra hot peppers or whatever you put in there. It was also $9 for about a third of a cup.\n\nI decided to splurge and ordered the filet mignon chile relleno for $26. Ordered it med rare but was told it is served med well and you don't have an option. I assumed that must mean they were pre-made or something. The presentation was nice and it had potential, but the sauce was so overly spicy that it was hard to taste anything else. The steak itself wasn't that tender or tasty. \n\nOne of my friends had the grilled calamari, which she really liked. Another had the vegetarian relleno and the other had chicken enchiladas. Both of them felt their food was too spicy as well. \n\nDon't get me wrong; I can enjoy good spicy Mexican food. But flavor should come first, not heat factor.  \n\nWe didn't have time for desert and it did take a little time to figure out the $175 check. He said he couldn't split it, which I understand and should have known better than to even ask. Word of advice: when dining with friends and planning to pay individually, bring enough cash. Having waited tables myself, I remember how difficult and timely it can be to split a check so each person can use his or her credit card, especially when they are busy. This is why they will tell you \"no.\"  It is not to annoy you. \n\nI doubt I'll go back. I guess I prefer my Mexican food more old fashioned and budget friendly. And if I want something more fancy, I'd choose Border Grille any day."

At a minimum the wait staff should check on you after receiving apps, mains, and offer dessert or coffee.

We come to vegas 2x a year for work and have finally realized in the past two trips that we need to get off the strip to get away from overpriced, mediocre food.  Mundo was one of the places I found and I haven't been disappointed!\n\nMost recently, we ate here last week with a group of 9 for a salesman dinner for hubby's company.  I felt the food would be accessible, there would be a good amount of alcohol flowing, and it wouldn't break the bank for that many people.  And the atmosphere/ look of the restaurant is impressive and beautiful.  When we were there they had a lot of beautiful in full bloom roses all over the restaurant.  \n\nOverall the dinner went really well and we had some wonderful dishes.  Everyone was pretty happy.  The only exception to that was that 3 people ordered the skirt steak dish and said it was on the tough/chewy side and could have used more marinating.\n\nHere's what we got:\n\nDrinks\nPaloma- a spin on a Margarita with grapefruit instead of lime juice\nMargarita- love their classic margarita and they're only $9!\nWhite wine- paco y lola arbarino from spain- delicious\nRed wine- casillero del diablo carmenere from chile- run of the mill red, probably should have gone for something else.  \n\nApps (shared)\nTortilla chips & salsa- complementary.  Fresh salsa and freshly fried chips.  Nice!\nQueso Flameado- comes with piping hot tortillas.  This was delicious but we were sharing and I couldn't tell what else was in it other than the melted cheese on top.  I think there's guacamole in there.  Would definitely get this again.  \nGuacamole- this was fine but nothing that special.\nCalamari- nicely fried calamari, but not a lot of them to share.  Probably wouldn't get this again.  \nAhi Tuna Tostada- this was an awesome dish.  Comes sliced into 6 wedges.  Very thin crispy tortilla with ground up ahi tuna spread on top.  It has some sort of garlic-y oil on it that makes it taste sooo good.  \nChopped salad- very nice and refreshing.  sweetened with cranberries.\n\nEntrees\nChilean sea bass- comes in a paper \"envelope\".  Was told that this was a very good dish\nScallops- comes on a bed of rice mixed with corn and some other things.  The scallops looked like they were burnt to a crisp on one side, but actually they were perfectly cooked.  the rice was very nice and a little spicy.\nSkirt steak- like I said, all three who got this said it was chewy and tough.  Disappointing to hear that.\nShrimp tamale- hubby got this and he was unimpressed with the tamale part, but the shrimp on top were really good.  Probably not worth the price of this entree.  \n\nDessert-\nChurros- filled with some sort of chocolate ganache with a small dish of melted chocolate for dipping.  Perfect ending to the evening."

The hostess sat us right away at a table for two, near the bar, which had a big TV running. It was a little confusing visually--is it a high-end dining establishment, or a tavern? Still, we were impressed overall by the decor.\n\nChips and salsa came right out. Salsa was basically fresh tomatoes, with some tang. It wasn't spicy whatsoever, and when I go out for Mexican (or even Latin inspired) food, I expect salsa served with chips to be at least a little spicy. Chips were just OK--keep in mind, we are Mexican/New Mexican/Latin food fanatics, so we are pretty critical, even of chips. That is your introduction to the meal, after all. The chips were sort of \"chewy,\" not super crisp.\n\nWe ordered 2 margaritas, which took a VERY long time to arrive. They were freshly made, so we forgave the fact that they tasted a little \"odd.\" They were good, and fresh, but did not have a familiar margarita flavor. Not very sweet at all, and VERY lemony. I ordered the Pollo Rosticado, and my wife the Carnitas. The food took again, a VERY long time to arrive. I am a chips and salsa freak, so even though I wasn't overwhelmed by the chips and salsa, I had eaten WAY too many chips by the time the food came out, which is rare for me. Both entrees were very good, and well prepared, which made up for the delay. I wish I could have finished mine actually, but again--too many chips.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our dinner, and had a nice time. We will probably try it again, the next time we go to the Smith Center. Would we go back, just to have dinner there? No. Why? The service was just below expectation for a pricey menu, and the location requires some planning for us."
