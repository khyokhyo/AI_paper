I think we all got the same thing lol.\n\nThough they REALLY skimped out on the fries, like literally less than a handful, the chicken tenders were delicious. Crunchy, chicken was juicy and flavorful, and that ranch made it allll the better!\n\nOur waiter for the night was this sweet older gentlemen...so cute!\n\nDef enjoyed my meal here."

Well, after doing whatever pleases you through the night..get your grub face on or as they say in Cantonese...\"Sil Yeh\" time.\n\nHead to the Market Cafe and get the Oxtail Soup or NY Steak or Breakfast after 11pm.  The Oxtail Soup is what most diners order and we had three orders.  The bowl of soup has around five oxtail, a side of rice, green onions, a chopped ginger / garlic side dish which you can dump in to your soup.  We sure did.\n\nPerfect hangover food for late night....  Go here.  Recover.  Start Again....."

Got free comp to Market Street Cafe cuz dad wanted me to try the signature oxtail soup. Definitely worth the hype. The meat was fall off the bone, full of fat, & so oily & delicious it leaves that coating of oil on your lips YUMo. Would definitely come here again, even without the comp, because it is super good! Surprisingly, with how busy the casino is around this time, the wait wasn't long & the food wait time wasn't too bad either."

It's still a great deal with the all you can eat salad bar, prime rib, and cherries jubilee for desert. Sometimes the prime rib is hit or miss with the quality, but it's all still edible. \n\nOther hawaiian offerings include butterfish, saimin, wonton soup, and the famous late night Oxtail soup (11pm -11am). Also, give the banana fritters a try for dessert. It'll make your stomach feel satisfied, happy, and wishing you didn't share."

Order an extra plate of rice because the two scoops of rice they serve you are getting a bit smaller. Prices have gone up over the past few years, currently (7/16/11) it is $9.99 without the coupon. \n\nThe soup comes with lots of oxtail, veggies, broth, a side of ginger, and peanuts, so if you're allergic to them let them know. \n\nI would give this place 5 stars but I do not order anything else on the menu, so I do not know how good the other food is. Actually I order the Two's Company once in a while which is a mean breakfast, only $4.95 (without coupon)."

            "review": "For the past 10 years, it has become tradition for us to come here each time we're in Vegas and we ARE in Vegas at least twice a year. What we come here for?? OXTAIL Soup! Served only from 11pm to 6am, the soup is just the perfect way to end a long night of partying in Vegas. It's a simple beef broth cooked with tender oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts. What makes this dish superb?? Cilantro, ginger bits, and Kikkoman soy sauce. Eat your meat and soup as you would with rice but add the seasonings on top of it. Ooh la la! It makes all the difference! It is served with two small cups of rice on the side but the bowl of soup itself is huge and can be shared by two people. Imagine what great value this was years ago when they were serving it for $5! Now it costs $10..hey, blame it on the economy! Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good deal. \n\nOxtail soup is not the only good thing here. They have quite an extensive menu of breakfast options that are of great value, too. \n\nSERVICE: We already know most of the servers here by face and they are always prompt and quick despite the unholy hours to be working. There can be a line to get a table but don't fret, it moves pretty quickly. \n\nUntil our next Vegas trip...Mahalo!"

We waited for our food and waited some more.  Yeah. I saw that \"oops\" look on that one server's face.\nShe brought out my saimin and it had obviously been sitting there a while.  The broth had cooled down and the noodles were soggy.\n\"Sorry.  Sorry, sir.  We'll bring out your plate soon.\"  It was a good 10 minutes or so before he got it.  At least his food was freshly made.  :-/\n\nI was determined to finally get a taste of the much-lauded soup.\nSo, on our last morning, I dragged a sleepy hubby back to The Cal at 5:30 A.M. only to find this sign posted:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/market-street-cafe-las-vegas?select=DFXBDC_7ewM9qpOR72Eu5w\nReally?

            "review": "4 months later and I'm still trying to figure out what all the hype was about.  Sure, the oxtail soup was good but I've had better.  I think the best thing about Market Street Cafe is the convenience.  It's located in the California Hotel and Casino where many locals from Hawaii stay and the food they serve is really familiar to us.  My personal preference is not to eat foods that remind me of home while on vacation.  However, so many of my friends and co-workers insisted that their oxtail soup is a must.  \n\nWe decided to go there late one night when we needed a break from the slot machines and gosh darn it, the line was ridiculously long.  It was about 3 am and the line wrapped around 3 times in the normal lobby/waiting area.  They weren't exactly taking customers in the order they came in but in the order which it was most convenient to seat certain amounts of people in your party.  If a table for 4 opened up, they would take the next party in line that had 4 people and so forth.  \n\nWhen we finally got seated, we ordered the Oxtail soup and the Loco Moco.  Both portions were pretty huge, which was a plus but like I said, I've had better.  I wasn't completely blown away by the food and the service was alright, they didn't exceed my expectations or anything.  I might go back if I'm dying to eat a really big and satisfying meal at 3 am but it for sure wouldn't be my first choice."

            "review": "I've been here a couple times in the past, but never cared for it. Even for the \"Hawaiian\" fare, it was all just a shrug. I know everyone raves about their Oxtail Soup, but I haven't had it. It's not one of my favorite dishes (even when my mom makes it). Anyway, I have visited twice recently because my brother has been receiving dining comps and I rarely say \"no\" to a free meal.\n\nDuring my first re-visit, our sister joined us and we ordered various breakfast and dinner options. I had a hankering for Corned Beef Hash (the non-homemade type), so I ordered it with eggs. Canned corned beef hash is so wrongfully tasty. I seriously don't understand my taste for it (or Spam), but I know that other people who grew up in Hawaii understand. Anyway, it's nothing spectacular and it's unfortunately salty, so it needs rice (which sucks since it already has starch from the potatoes!). My sister ordered a Loco Moco, another popular dish in Hawaii made of rice, hamburger patty, eggs, and brown gravy. I don't eat this dish often, but it's still enjoyable when it's made well. This particular one wasn't very good, mostly due to the substandard gravy. We all chose the AYCE salad bar as well since it was so inexpensive ($5.95). It's not expansive, but completely worth it.\n\nThe second time, my brother and I decided to try their Breakfast Buffet for $6.25/person (6AM - 11AM). SIX DOLLARS AND TWENTY-FIVE CENTS!!! That is insanely cheap. Completely ridiculous and awesome. They offer scrambled eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, bacon, grilled ham, biscuits with sausage gravy, corned beef hash, hash browns, French toast, various canned fruits, and a few other items. One plate of rice, eggs, and just five pieces of Portuguese sausage would cost you more than $6.25 at another restaurant. It's a crazy deal. Oh, and you also get free juice with your buffet. A can of Hawaiian Sun juice? YES PLEASE! I also took home an order of Zippy's chili and rice which was cool that they have it. I used to love Zippy's chili, but it's not something I crave anymore.\n\nOkay, so the food isn't top notch and I thought I was going to have a heart attack just by looking at the breakfast buffet (seriously though, the red heat lamps are slightly blinding) - where are the vegetables?! But for the value, my goodness, it is worth just the few good things they offer! Just beware the hash brown...it was disgustingly dry and tasteless. Oh, and it's really difficult to screw up bacon, so you're safe there!\n\nFor a really inexpensive \"Hawaii Eats\" meal for any hour of the day, this is worth visiting. Just leave your expectations at the door and trust me, you'll have a good time."

The cost of the soup is only $8.95. So it's better if you rent a car. \n\nI only ordered oxtail soup so I didn't know about other dishes, but they have 1/2 lb steak for only $4.95 so it's probably worthwhile to try.\n\nBeware they only serve the oxtail soup between 11pm - 11am except sunday. \n\nYou will have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes to get the soup\n\nSoup come with rice so it's good if you're around 3 AM and super hungry and need a quick fix of warm meal\n\nToo bad they don't have fried onion and sambal to garnish the soup. Tabasco just doesn't cut it.  \n\nSoup comes with grated ginger and cilantro on the side. Adding cilantro to the soup makes sense, but adding ginger to the soup is weird IMO."

They had a great deal for a prime rib dinner at around 13-15 dollars a person. The dinner came with a salad and dessert. The Prime rib was accompanied by a loaded potato and veggies. The quality of prime rib was buffet style and bland. The texture was tough and fatty. The potato was as good as any other. The salad bar was mediocre. The dessert was cherries jubilee which tasted like a cafeteria dessert. My father liked his meal but he's not a foodie.

I looked at the reviews on yelp and everyone seemed to rave about the oxtail soup. \n\nWe arrived around 10 PM tonight, and met \"Maria\" our hostess.  Man....she must of been having a bad day because she did not smile once when she greeted us, and seemed like she didn't want to be at work.  Not a good first impression for customers.  \n\nWell we finally get seated and the first thing she ask me is \"Are you ordering the prime rib?  If you are you only have a few minutes.\"  I told her I think I'm gonna get the oxtail soup.  She tells me \"if you are gonna order the soup you have to go outside and wait back in line until 11p.\"  I told her no that's fine, I'll order something else.  \n\nShe storms off, and proceeds to mumble something to her fellow coworker. While waiting for our waiter...she keeps staring me down like I did something wrong.  Again as she walks by my table she tells the waiter that I have to go back outside if I am ordering the soup.  I'm thinking in my head...wow what did I do to piss her off. I've been nothing but polite to her and the rest of the staff.\n\n\nWell we finally get our food and guess what...we find a black hair in my son's wonton soup.  At this point I am furious because of all the smart remarks she told us, and the digusting hair in our soup.  Fortunately the waiter did not charge us for the soup and one of the other entrees.  \n\nSo unfortunately I did not get to try the oxtail soup, and have given 1 star for the rude service.  I did file a complaint with the supervisor who was polite and had me write a statement, as \"Maria\" has been a problem before.  \n\nMaybe next time I'll come back to try the oxtail soup when Maria no longer works there.  By the way I have a weird feeling Maria put the black hair in our food but have no way of knowing.\n\n\nI took a picture of maria as she is giving us the evil death stare....lol."

All the staff is friendly, but sometimes they forget about your table and you have to kind of flag them down. The food always comes out pretty quick so if they seem like they are taking a while you should check on your order. \n\n===Food===\n\nOxtail soup: By far the best oxtail soup that I've had. The broth is delicious here! I definitely recommend getting this here.\n\nSteak & eggs: Surprisingly a very tender piece of meat with 2 eggs, toast and your choice of rice or hash browns. The steak was around 6 oz. so it's a little on the smaller side, but it was very good. \n\nPrime rib dinner: The prime rib was pretty good for the price. You definitely can't complain when it comes to this entree. \n\nAYCE salad bar: Your typical salad bar with all the toppings. Make sure you wear some loose pants! \n\nI highly recommend eating here if you get hungry and need a snack break in between gambling. It's delicious! Enjoy!"

The oxtail soup is why I always go here, and evidently the reason why everyone else goes here.    \n\nAfter a long drive from California, this dish surely hits the spot.  With tender oxtail meat, carrots, celery, ginger, peanuts in a flavorful broth....I have reason to sleep well afterwards.  There have been a few times when the meat doesn't fall off the bone though.  But most of the time it does.  With 2 scoops of rice and a side of cilantro and minced ginger, about $8 is still worth it...even when I used to pay about $6 back in the day.  \n\nI've also ordered the steak graveyard special, breakfast, and the banana fritters platter.  For $4, you can't go wrong with these cheap eats.  They definitely fill you up after a long drive or after gambling all night.  The service here is okay, pretty friendly staff.  Expect a long line at around 11 PM, when the oxtail soup is available, but if you're there around 3 AM like I usually am, its smooth sailing.  If you end up waiting long, many \"locals\" will tell you that it's worth the wait."

After standing in a line about 50 yards deep I was surprised how fast we got to the front and were seated. There are a lot of great items on the menu from Eggs Benedict for under $8, to the Lau Lau, short ribss and much more but I came for one reason and one reason only. I had been told that my Mom has made this for us when I was younger but I honestly dont remember.\n\nThe large bowl of broth had plenty of bones with meat coming off the bones. The soup is seasoned very well and I would compare it to a Mexican/Hispanic dish Cocido which uses a different meat but still has a similar taste and texture. If there was one complaint is that a couple of bones had a lot of fat on it but again, I have the same issue on even some of my favorite cocido restaurants. Its going to happen.\n\nMy wife tried the Wanton soup but I must explain that she is a very picky eater and does not like vegetables so the bowl of Oriental Soup Combo that the very nice waitress suggested was out of the picture. She ate some of her soup but said it had a strong odor. I tried it and could not pick up any unusual or bad smell.\n\nWe also ordered the banana fritters. This was a little deceiving but still very tasty. They give you about 3-4 wanton wrappers with a nut medley inside. It is very good. They also give you a bowl of ice crean and about a half a banana cut into 3/8\" slices. Half is being generous. \n\nThe service was fast and they filled our water glasses often. The waitress was very nice and patient with me when I asked her dumb questions like \"do most people put the rice into the broth?\". She suggested not to and I didn't; what do you think.\n\nI would love to come back and try something else but I dont think my wife is going to come with me."

I settled on \"go for broke\" (Haha) I explained my urgency for this entree to the hosts at the stand. I waited a bit, then a hostess got me a table for one.\n\nAfter being seated, my server dropped off my beverage and went to tend to other tables in her section. After a bit, I scanned for my server on the floor... I got more and more anxious as the minutes ticked by and the chances of getting the prime rib special dwindled... I finally flagged down a male server and asked if he could put in my order. I explained my desperate situation. He did. And I got my prime rib special :D \n\nI was very thankful for the actions of this older Asian male server who made it possible for me to enjoy my last meal in Vegas.

Let's just get it out of the way right now...OXTAIL SOUP!!  I have no clue why I am even reviewing it since almost every Yelper on here has given enough details on how good it is. I just would hate to over-hype it for anyone.  Bottom line, you have to try their Oxtail Soup yourself.  My only wish is that it was serviced on a plate full of rice.  \n\nMarket Street's portions are huge and the prices definitely cheap.  I recently had a full pound of their NY Steak Strip for about $12.  Not the best steak in the world, but good enough.  Back to their Oxtail, hooked up for sure. Enough to serve the average two people.  But I always seem to kill it on my own. \n\nCouple of Tips:\n-Oxtail is only served after 11 PM.  This could have changed by now, but I never take the risk and just make sure I'm in after 11 PM.  \n\n-The line is long, but not as long as it looks.  If you're a single or party of 2, doesn't take long at all.  If you're a party of 4+, can take at least 15 minutes.  Also there's no wait if you're sitting at the kitchen bar. \n\n-Daily Specials: Review their board for their daily specials.  Believe me, some great deals there.  1/2 lb NY Steak for $5.99 is a steal!!"

That's were I remembered the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside the California Hotel.\n\nWhen we arrived around 4am, we were about the fourth ones in line. But, the dining area was packed. Our wait didn't take that long since we were only a party of two. Once we were seated, I searched for the oxtail soup entree. I read the fine print on the menu regarding the oxtail soup special. The menu states that the soup is currently served from 11pm to 9am with a $9.99 price tag. With it being 4am, I was elated to try it out!\n\nOur waiting time for our food was around twenty minutes. It was understandable since the cafe was always packed. When our food arrived, it looked like I had one big piece of oxtail. But that wasn't the case. Under the thick cuts of celery and leaves of cilantro, more pieces were under there. There were also meat pieces embedded at the bottom of the huge bowl! The meat was that tender! This dish was also accompanied with a small plate of white rice. This place knows carb control. As for myself, I would have filled up my bowl with rice until there was no broth left. The broth of the soup had me in shock! It actually tasted like how my Dad makes his oxtail soup, but with different vegetables. Full of flavor and the right kind of saltiness.\n\nMarket Street Cafe had my home cooked meal waiting for me. But having my Dad pop out the kitchen, that would have been just too weird!"

You get salad bar, prime rib dinner, and a desert all for $7.99.  I couldn't believe it.  \n\nI eat here every time i come to Las Vegas, no matter where i stay.  I love being around locals (people from Hawaii) and enjoying good food.  The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the service isn't wonderful.  Then again it depends, any given day you could get good or bad service.  Some days you may have a very attentive server, and on others you may have you chase them down to get refills on your drink.  But the food and price makes up for all of that.  \n\nRock you like a hurricane."

After driving for 8 hours and getting there on Friday night, I was too tired to wait till 11pm for the Oxtail soup, so we went anyway to see what was on the menu.\n\nI was happy to find Oxtail stew as one of the specials, so I ordered that. My s/o ordered the butterfish plate. Being of the Caucasian persuasian from Texas, I asked her if she knew what butterfish was. Not wanting to seem unlocal, she assured me that she knew what it was. \n\nSo I asked her if she was sure she wanted it with a baked potato. She thought about it for a second and said, \" Maybe I should get the rice.\" I told her it might taste better with rice.\n\nThe watress assured her that the butterfish was \"ONO\", I was thinking more like \"oh, no\" \n\nIn like less than 5 minutes we get our dinners, the oxtail stew was lukewarm and the meat did not fall off the bone. It tasted ok, but being served lukewarm was a downer.\n\nMy s/o takes a bite, looks at the butterfish and tells me, its a little different than what she remembered. I tasted it and told her, tastes like butterfish to me, then she tells me, \"Oh I was thinking moonfish\"\n\nOh, well... because she didn't like her dinner I never got the chance to go back for a late night Oxtail soup run. It'll have to wait till next time."

Being a European from across the sea, I believe that equals unhealthy food, however; from an American perspective it might sound as ''comfort'' food.\n\nThe reason why this place didn't earn its full star is simply because the variety of items they have. Sure, they have all night specials that are screamingly cheap. And that's the only reason why I would come:\n\n''Have to stay around Fremont St., being up late (past 12AM) and in need of hot food.''\n\nIn they day time I would avoid this place at any time since there are greater places to fill your tummy. If you come at night, make sure you have still some patience since  lines can get very busy and the restaurant is very big and always filled, resulting into long wait times and not-so-special service (more like conveyor belt service!), but that's o.k. for the price of a fast food meal."

Nothing beats a large steaming bowl of meaty broth on a cold night either. The added garnishes of chopped ginger, fresh garlic, and cilantro makes the broth better. For such a complex dish, it is a bummer that the liquid tastes like straight up beef broth from the store. Other than that, the whole experience was great. The Asian fried chicken was moist and flavorful. It comes with a side of vegetables and a choice of carb. The NY steak is nothing to right home about and was not cooked to our specification, but it was decent. I would suggest one of the two first items.\n\nThe service is attentive and quick. We were able to get in and out within an hour. The best part is that three meals cost a total of $26. Late night menus are the best to soak up all the alcohol and prevent hangovers."

Call me crazy, but I think that's what makes this place enjoyable and is fine by me.  A piece of advice: get well acquainted with the menu while you wait in the ridiculously long line (because their oxtail soups draws a crowd.) Once you get seated and pleasantries are exchanged, you quickly tell the server that you want the soup (because why wouldn't you order the soup...that's why you're here) and whatever it is that you want and that's it. They'll come with the soup and whatever else you ordered pretty as you please and the servers will check on you exactly two more times after that. Once for some refilling and the next for the check. \n\nCome here and come often. This is one of the best places to have oxtail soup. You won't be disappointed. \n\nTill next Yelp!"

We had 3 huge pieces of oxtail in a tomato based stew with lots of veggies and potatoes. I split the meal with my sister along with an order of their miso butterfish....yummmm!!  The restaurant is a bit run down but no one goes for the ambiance. It's all about the comfort foods!"

            "review": "I may get chastised for this but I have to say that the oxtail soup was not a 5-star experience and not the best soup ever for me. I did state in a previous review that whenever something is deemed as the 'best' ever, I am usually disappointed. I think this was the case. All of the hype over the soup had it so built up in my head, that it could never live up to my expectations. OR maybe it was due to the fact that the gentleman at the table next to me was obnoxiously eating the soup and making very loud noises and groans while he ate. I don't know -- it didn't ignite that kind of passion in me. I guess I just didn't get it. I would say that the soup was pretty good but I'm not drinking the koolaid like everyone else. I liked how big the portion was (big enough to split) and we had amazing service, even though they were extremely busy. We noticed that at least 50% of the restaurant (if not more) were ordering the soup, so it seems like the secret is out!\n\nOne important thing to note: the reviews don't lie. If you come here after 11 to get some of the soup, it'll be packed and you may have to wait for a table. Don't let it stop you though. Good things come to those who wait."

You want to go to a place where everyone knows your name.  Well, get out of bed and make your way to the Market Street Cafe in the California Hotel!\n\nI think the Cal is just ok, but the main reason I keep coming back is because of this place!  I think although this diner is just ok and offers an overwhelmingly big menu, there's no question about their graveyard menu and specials.  That's why I keep coming back!\n\nOn Sunday, I came and got the Oxtail Soup and a cup of the chili, as I always get every single time like clockwork.  The total came to about $15.  I ALWAYS have a great time with the Oxtail soup.  This soup is filled with pine nuts, carrots, celery and huge pieces of oxtail!  They serve it with cilantro and ginger.  I can't enough of it!  The oxtail is super moist and marbleized.  I often times have dreams about it! LOL.  The chili is good because it's the Zippy's style chili back home in Hawaii.  The chili is super creamy and I heard they actually put peanut butter in the recipe to help with the creaminess.  \n\nRemember what I said.  If you find yourself hungry for some local Hawaiian food, get your butt to Market Street Cafe.  They're open 24 hours a day and will surely help satisfy your cravings, BRAH!"

            "review": "I am a fan of the casino cafe (or Diner as they call them in New York). Sadly, the casinos are gradually replacing them with newer restaurants. In downtown Las Vegas, we recently lost the El Cortez Cafe to Pizza Lotto and the Golden Nugget Cafe to Claim Jumper. I believe that the old school casino cafes compliment the casino experience along with good food at reasonable prices. And so, when I met up with my brother on the Fremont Street East District, we'd walk to the Cali where I'd take advantage of some good old school cafe food. \n\n    The Market Street Cafe is both the Cali cafe and a restaurant serving Hawaiian food. Their oxtail soup has become a Las Vegas legend. This is no accident. The Cali caters to the Hawaii market and is the epicenter of the Ninth Island casino scene. Market Street Cafe also features a diverse menu with a range of reasonably priced comfort food and daily specials. I usually order the $9.99 prime rib special. This includes the soup and salad bar; a choice of baked potato with sour cream and butter, rice, or mashed potatoes; with cherry jubilee a vanilla ice cream based dessert. \n\n    Market Street Cafe is a popular dining spot along the Fremont Street Corridor. Just like the last few times I dined here (including before I became Daniel. S Yelper),  a long line is the admission to this dining experience. The long line is the prelude to a restaurant that fills to capacity. The line usually moves along. \n\n    Immediately after ordering, I headed to the soup and salad bar, which is usually included with the dinners. The only flaw with the soup and salad bar is that the soup was nonexistent. I was satisfied with the salad. The salad bar also featured corn salad and pasta salad. \n\n    The impersonal waitress soon delivered the prime rib dinner. It was a nice cut of beef with the exception of a couple of fat spots. Overall it was flavorful. With the prime rib, a jus sauce added an additional layer of taste. Complimenting the prime rib was a baked potato that I flavored with butter and sour cream. This was nothing like the baked potato that I recently dug into in the Triple 7 Restaurant in Cali's sister property Main Street Station. It also included green beans that they can keep for the pigs in the North Las Vegas pig farm. It was halfway into festing on the prime rib that the waitress added an additional item onto the table. It was my dessert. Placing dessert on a guest's table when they are half way into the meal is an ABSOLUTE NO NO. Talk about hurrying somebody! Talk about unprofessional service. And let me talk more about poor service. The unprofessional waitress failed to ask me if I wanted a Pepsi refill. So following the cordial rule of dining, I tasted the cherry jubilee that is really vanilla ice cream after finishing the prime rib and baked potato. I just made it to the ice cream because it started melting. \n\n    After paying around $13 to the cashier and showing the casino cashier my receipt for the parking validation, I walked past the banks of Cali slot machines filled up yet slightly annoyed. As I waited for the light to turn green at Ogden Street, it was clear to me that I will be dining at and yelping at least nine Fremont Street restaurants before and if I do go to Market Street Cafe. \n\nPictures of the $9.99 Prime rib dinner meal experience:"

            "review": "Market Street Cafe located inside the California Hotel Casino in old downtown Las Vegas is a mirage to locals and tourist from Hawaii! From the get go you will notice employees with the Hawaiian uniforms and Hawaiian workers and guests! How ironic being the name of the place is California. Nonetheless still a place that caters to all ethnicities.  It is rumored that liaisons contact Hawaiian travel agency and tourist a package deal to get tourist I stay and visit...which is smart marketing!  Asides from loose slots that gets customers playing a while without losing all their money quick...it is the food and specials that are the perfect perks to reel in the big catch!  They have various places in California hotel...but Market Street Cafe is the main attraction.  \n\nFirst and foremost it is the oxtail soup that receives the most attention.  It's familiar taste to Asian cultures have a similar taste to Filipino's bulalo soup and other Hawaiian, Korean and what not.  Also, since their special for oxtail soup starts at 11pm it is great for a late night hang over cure as well! Beware tho at peak hours especially for specials...the line gets long. But if you run into it...need not worry....it goes at a fairly steady pace.  The other special they have before 10pm is the Prime Rib! To have it done at medium is at its best! The tender and juicy cut of meat mixed with salivation of hunger melts this hunk of chunk so smoothly!  Anything higher in cooking is fair game...still tender but the taste comes different and more like corned beef....usually places that cook prime rib at this level be a little tougher but still have that prime rib flavor...so again I recommend medium.  With this price coming in at an amazing $9.99 one must be reminded not to forget it comes with an all you can eat salad bar that includes macaroni salad (a crowd favorite especially Hawaiians) and fruits! Plus you get a warm cherry/cinnamon vanilla ice cream sundae like concoction with a cone like wafer on the side.  \n\nYou have to remember this place is old, but respectable.  Might not be a place for fine dining but for a casual and deal breaker and wanting it to hit the spot...this is the place!  I haven't had a chance to try their other stuff, but some say they are just as good and satisfying. Happy Eating! And Aloha!"

I have not sampled a large selection from their menu because I stick to a couple of basic things.\n\n1.  Prime Rib Special.  If I'm there after 4, there's no question about what I'll eat.  Tasty prime rib, soup or salad, baked potato, green beans almondine and cherries jubilee for dessert.  All for $7.99.  It used to be $6.99, but the price went up about a year ago.  Still, best prime rib special in town.  In my dozens of times eating the prime rib, I can only remember being disappointed once.  Even then, it was good and I didn't feel ripped off by paying eight bucks for it.\n\n2.  Things made with fish.  If I'm not there in the evening, I stick to things made out of fish.  The fish and chips, butterfish, etc are all pretty good.  I've tasted catfish from friends' plates - also good. \n\nLunch and dinner specials all come with the salad bar or soup.  The salad bar has declined in quality a little bit, but I think that's how they kept the prices low when food costs started rising.  There used to be sushi and spinach and a few other things, but now those things are gone.  It's pretty basic, but has more than enough to keep you happy - especially since it's not an additional charge with a daily special.\n\nA few people have mentioned the service and I think it's really hit and miss.  Sometimes it's awesome and your glass is refilled before it hits the table.  Other times it can be tough to get someone to come over.  The number of customers fluctuates so drastically that I think they  have a hard time knowing how many servers to keep on the floor.  Either way, I always leave happy."

We, of course, were hoping to find a turkey dinner, but did not know it that was in the cards.\n\nAfter getting settled at our hotel, we got back in the car and headed to downtown (so much cooler than the Strip).  We wandered through Main Street Station and then over to the California.  Somewhere along the way, we saw a sign for the Market Street Cafe, offering a turkey dinner for $10.99!  \"Score!,\" said we.   We could not think of a more perfect option for Thanksgiving in Vegas.\n\nDespite the maze outside that suggests you must sometimes wait in line for a table, we were seated immediately at a comfy table towards the rear of the restaurant.  \n\nService was quick and friendly.  We did not have to wait long for our turkey dinners and, frankly, they were pretty dang good.  All of the sides were tasty, but I was completely enraptured by the sweet potatoes, which is something I never cook on my own.\n\nAt the end of our main course, we were (pleasantly) surprised to learn our dinners included a slice of pie.  They were out of pumpkin pie, but I was able to get a slice of the custard pie, which I probably would have ordered anyhow.  It was not too sweet, which is just the way I like it, and quite yummy.\n\nOne odd thing:  The menu states \"cocktails are available 24 hours a day,\" and I ordered a glass of red wine ($3.50!) to have with my meal.  The waiter told me it must be served by the cocktail waitress and would be a separate check.  \"No problem,\" said I.  And, I waited, and waited, and waited some more for my drink.  The waitress finally appeared, just as I was getting close to finishing my meal.  She apologized and said someone else had called in sick and said she was the only waitress on duty that night and was being run ragged.  \"No problem,\" said I, again.  The wine was served in a plastic cup, and, this being Vegas, I was able to take it to go.\n\nIn addition to the decent food, good service, comfortable setting,  and beyond decent prices, we ended up having a nice chat with the folks sitting at the table next to ours.  We very much enjoyed our experience at the Market Street Cafe and, were we to return to Las Vegas, would definitely stop in again."

I'd say my number 2 mistake was NOT getting to Market Street Cafe at the right time (11APM - 9AM?) to try their oxtail soup!\n\nMy party and I rolled in hungover and hungry around 9AM. By that time, the last call for ox tail soup had already been heralded and so we were SOL.\n\nI ended up  ordering the Combination Siamin: The saimin was good. The broth wasn't too salty, there were a lot of goodies in it including kamaboko, char-siu, spinach, and some other stuff I can't remember. I couldn't finish the broth but I just about finished all the noodles. The waitress was nice enough to bring me some chili (sambal) sauce so I could make it spicy to my liking. \n\nMy bf and his friends ordered the breakfast buffet, which was a deal at $6.25 and the buffet included: corned beef hash (the canned variety), bacon, biscuits and gravy (good!), eggs, sausage, french toast, and a good assortment of other breakfast items including fresh fruit.\n\nThis is a great place if you are looking to spend under $10 for breakfast buffet, OR, if you are really drunk in the middle of the night and just need some soup (which is always the case with me!). I realized this is the best place to eat anytime in DTLV for cheap since they are open 24/7."

We ordered 3 ox tail soups, one Hawaiian breakfast and I got an extra side of hash browns. What's an after drinking meal without some kind of potatoes?\n\nOur food came quicly and we dug right in. About half way in when I came up for air, I noticed my hash browns had not arrived. I reminded the waitress , and she brought one out right away.  I actually wished I had forgotten it all together because they were not crunchy and were more like mashed potatoes and oil on the inside. \n\nThe oxtail broth was a little on the salty side, but the oxtail itself was fall off the bone delish.\n\nOf course it being 3am, there was a table of young guys staring impolitely at us while we were gnawing on those ox tails. One of them actually had his phone out and appeared to be snapping photos of us. Oh well."

The food is always good, they have excellent service (the staff is friendly & attentive), it's fairly priced, and I feel like I'm back in the islands. Being here makes me less home sick. :)\n\n For some reason I really liked their pancakes, it was light and fluffy. It satisfied my craving for some form of cake. This is a go to spot for me when I'm downtown, eating with family or bringing my Hawai'i family and friends here when they come to visit. It's the lure of the oxtail that keeps me coming back to this place, although I don't always order it.  I've had the Oxtail soup which is pretty large, at least for me. It's a bummer the price went up :(, $9.99. They have to keep their business going somehow right? \n\nThere are late night specials and a breakfast buffet which are pretty decent. The Reuben sandwich which is actually pretty good here in my opinion (i really liked it compared to other places). No complaints about food, food is pretty decent. The salad bar is good too, but it sucks that its only available during certain times."

I've never really frequented this place unless it was after 11pm.\n\nFood: The food they offer here is a mix of American and Hawaiian food, with emphasis on Hawaiian food. There's a few filipino dishes I recognize, but for the most part it's considered a special. Of course, I have to mention the Oxtail Soup, a special that only runs from 11pm-9am in the morning. So if you're a late night owl, this is definitely the dish for you! It's their most popular dish. Although in my opinion, it's a little on the pricey side, it's still a good comfort dish. I've tried the Corned Beef Hash, Steak and Eggs, and Philippine Breakfast (Tocino and Eggs with Rice, my personal favorite). They're all pretty solid diner foods which you can't go wrong with, especially if you like breakfast food (again, my favorite meal). \n\nEnvironment/Ambiance: It's located in the California Hotel and Casino. Older looking diner, it doesn't really scream Hawaiian theme. Kinda dark and dreary especially at night, but always busy and full of patrons. \n\nService: Service is pretty quick...once you're seated. Sometimes it takes forever to be seated but that's just an indication of how popular this place is. For the most part, our servers have been pretty welcoming, polite, and friendly. We've had maybe one bad apple that we've had the pleasure of being waited on by. \n\nTips: Try the Oxtail soup! And if you get the Philippine Breakfast, pour the fried garlic on EVERYTHING! You're welcome."

The meat falls off the bones and the broth is flavorful but not too salty.  The soup comes with some large pieces of oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts.  It also comes served with ginger, parsley, and a side of rice.  I like to mix the ginger and parsley with soy sauce to dip my chunks of oxtail in.  The price has been rising slowly over the years.  It is now $9.99.  Still worth it in my opinion.  I order this 99% of the time.\n\nWe also like their Zippy's chili spaghetti.  It is the same chili that is served in the Hawaii chain, Zippy's.  The only thing is that they give you tons more here than they do at Zippy's!  What a steal for about $6.  The actual entree is called Chili rice but you can substitute for spaghetti.\n\nExpect a line around midnight and again around 2am... when people leave the clubs.

Although there are a couple of things I'd still like to try.  Plus, not that I'm a late night eater, but it is open all night, and their prices are good. \n\nThat said, my favorite soup here is not the Ox-Tail Soup everybody raves about, and honestly, I've never tried, but would like to one day.  No, my favorite soup is the Oriental noodle Soup, which is saimen noodles, fish cake and won-ton dumplings.  I probably get this entree three-fourths of the times I'm here.  The noodles are good, the broth is good, the fish cake and dumplings - it's all good, filling, and for a soup, doesn't bloat you up.  This entree is a four and it's my favorite on the menu. \n\nOther entrees I like here are curry, it's a thick sauce, which is what I like about it.  The spaghetti and chili is also pretty good.  I've never had the burgers, here, though and I'm interested to try. As for the other sandwiches, they are okay.  And the banana split for dessert fills the need if I know I won't be visiting Lappert's upstairs later on.  \n\nI hardly ever order anything that includes rice and or vegetables as the sides beacuse I find myself only eating the main item, but not the sides. The main entrees are okay, but it's the sides that are disappointing.  The two main sides are rice and vegetables.  For a restaurant that has a lot of Hawaiian customers, the rice here can be really disappointing, and the vegetables are also disappointing, too.\n\nThey have a breakfast buffet that is a pretty good deal - the selections are pretty limited, but the food is okay and less than six dollars, you can't beat the price."

Really good price for the amount of oxtail they give you! They're consistent as  as everytime we have gone, it has tasted the same. This is a great place to eat after a night of drinking. One of my friends even got a steak dinner for $6.99, you can't beat that! We even took our friends that visited Vegas for their first time and they loved it!"

Could it be because it's 2am with no traffic or because I'm in an alcohol induced coma? Standing in line is the best  for people watching. You've got families, rough necks, elderly couples, drunk chicks wearing 300 dollar shoes, random gamblers and lurkers. I feel so comfortable there and never fails to shake out the cobwebs before the gastronomic adventures that await. Ok, an overstatement, but when you're drunk it can be an adventure of some sort.\n\nAlready had the Tocino on my mind, but so much hype about the Oxtail Soup got me curious. The server arrived to put down place settings and water and I started to ask her about it just as I read her name badge. Let me rephrase: I \"attempted\" to read her name badge. What I saw was a collection of letters, heavy on the vowel count and in a configuration I have not seen before. Trying to blink my eyes back into focus and reboot the brain cells that got short circuited from trying to process her name was time enough for Server X to bounce. I let it go for the moment and planned to ask her about it upon her return. The food arrived. Delicious comfort food was just what I needed. I didn't see purple on the menu, but would have been sooo good. Distracted by all that was going on at the table Server X slipped my mind. When the busboy came to clear the table I asked him, \"Hey, that girl that set the table for us, what's her name?\" Dude was pretty tall and when I asked he stood upright and stared out into the distance. From the low viewing angle I could still see the blank look on his face. Awkward silence ensued. A good 10 seconds passed before he responded: \"I don't know.\" with shame in his eyes. WTF... then, \"Nobody knows how to pronounce her name.\" And he quickly bounced. She never returned. Laughlin sucks.\n\nI'll be back to find you mystery Server. I got an extra Yelp star with your name on it... Well, it will, once I figure out what the hell it is."

I have not been able to try it because I've come multiple times around 11pm on various days and the line is always looping around and packed. It is only served from 11pm to 7am. I usually get the loco moco (rice, spam, egg, gravy) and Hawaiian Sun guava drink. Definitely as unhealthy as you can get, but works for nursing or preventing a hangover. The food here is not gourmet or even close by any means, but I have yet to get food poisoning. I did get the runs one time from the greasy breakfast buffet. If you're sensitive to oil content I'd recommend avoiding it. Someone also pointed out that this place seems to not serve much fresh produce. The side veggies that come with the specials look like they're from a frozen bag or a can. The fruit in the breakfast buffet are definitely canned. Except for the bananas. \n\nService is can be slow because they're always busy and most of the people working here are probably from Hawaii. If you've been to Hawaii you'll know what I mean. If it is just you go sit at the counter. You can just walk up there without waiting and other from the person standing back there instead of waiting forever for a table. \n\nUh, you gamblers can use your dining vouchers here."

I'm from Hawaii but they BUTCHERED me and send me to YOUR FREAKIN' BOWL! All for $5.99!

For those not in the know, the California Hotel or 'the Cal' is a hot zone for people from Hawaii when they visit Hawaii. It's the laws of Hawaiian physics. We all flock here for some reason. Either the cheap food, the  low rolling gambling or just being around other people from Hawaii has everyone coming back for more. \n\nAhh yes, back to those fond memories. After a night of drinking, gambling and good ole Vegas debauchery in downtown, stumbling into Market Street Cafe at 1am and saying those two magical words, 'oxtail soup,' is a blessing. The order comes with a side of rice as well. The soup is delightful and the meat (if you can get it off the bones) is tender. Adding ginger and cilantro to the soup give it even more flavor!\n\nBesides the oxtail soup, there are many local favorites on their very extensive menu. One of the better deals for dinner is their prime rib + unlimited salad bar + dessert for only $9.99. It's quite a steal and the prime rib is decent. There are daily specials that are written on the board out by the cashier. \n\nDepending on the day and time of year, the line for this joint can be pretty long but hang in there. It moves pretty quickly and we're always seated in no time."

There will be days that you'll have great customer service and there will be days that you will not have good customer service, there will be days your food is amazing and there will not be days where your food is amazing - inconsistent. \n\nFood is an 8/10 just because each time I have ordered it was delicious. Their late night specials start at 11pm, which is the time I usually go and it's most of the time good. Their steak and eggs plate, prime rib, etc. Their fountain drinks are free refills but not heir juices (you pay per can.)\n\nCustomer services is a hit or miss. Sometimes you'll have an amazing server who is very attentive. But most times when I came here with my grandparents we have received rude service or servers who lack attention to customers. Sometimes we only see our server three times: when they take our order, when they deliver our food, and when they give us our checks. It is such a hard time to call upon other servers to ask for to-go boxes, a refill, or a correction on a mistake on your food. Due to the fact that my grandparents visit Vegas and come to Market Street because it is a part of their vacation package we have been experiencing this for the past five years. I have witnessed servers sigh and roll their eyes at my grandparents when they get confused about menu items, this has frustrated me overtime. We'd take our business elsewhere but Market Street is way too convenient and for some other customers are the only option because they have it on their vacation package they pre-paid for.\n\nGood food, bleh service."

Heres the trick.. it's served from 11pm - 11 am every day.  So it's all a crap shoot but try going around 3 or 4am the line might be shorter AND it gives the ox tails a few more hours to stew and get softer. Mmm... ox tails...  or even go in the morning before lunch.. \n\nas a whole the place is okay nothing fancy, don't expect too much.  maybe even 2 stars if it wasn't for the ox tail soup.  Just stick to the plan... don't stray from the path... stick to what works.. The specials... NY Steak, Prime Rib, and Ox Tail soup (sorry i forgot what time the NY steak and Prim Rib specials are)\n\nhere is a list of the nightly specials http://static.boydgaming.net/california/media/downloads/MSC_dsi_10_2009_01.pdf\n\nI tried the friday special \"Kalbi and huli huli chicken\" not that great, i have to say... it was definitely not hulu huli chicken... more of a baked teriyaki chicken?  would not get it again..  like i said, stick to the game plan..  although a few things on the list do intrigue me... Sunday, black bean sauce pork riblets, and Monday's Ox tail STEW (11AM-11PM) and i did see butterfish (Gindara or black cod) which i love in Japanese restaurants but I'm still on the fence trying it at this place.  Hey sometimes you gotta step outside the box right?!  So sooner or later i'll give these a shot.\n\nThink i had the Tuesday night special one time too (LauLau and Chicken long rice) i think it was okay..\n\nPros: Late night ox tail soup, cheep breakfast buffet, Vacations Hawaii coupons if you are from Hawaii and booked thru them. \n\nCons: Some of the food is just okay and nothing special, so pick and choose wisely.\n\nTips:  1.  They offer brown rice on request, don't do it!  I don't know what kind of rice it is but it's really gross!  Maybe uncle Ben's instant brown rice??  \n2.  Wait a little longer to get the ox tail soup (don't go at 11 when they start offering it), it will be more tender the later you go, give it time.\n3. for the ox tail extravaganza try going on a Monday for the ox tail stew 11 am -  11 pm, then the ox tail soup from 11 PM to 11 AM."

Second of all, it was obvious that you went to a lower grade meat. I do NOT call this slab of meat Prime Rib. It was like some nasty slab of meat that could not even be cut w a knife. All of the people in our party agreed. We complained to the waiter who then told us we were not the first people to complain that night and that many others complained as well. What did he do? He took the prime rib off our bill and charged us for \"all you can eat salad bar\" that came with the prime rib. Whoop di do!! Prime rib is $9.99, all you can eat salad bar is just a few dollars less. I've been getting your prime rib every year for the past 10 years and it's obvious this is NOT the same grade of meat, it honestly tasted like Ass.\n\nI gave stars because the ox tail soup reminds outstanding.

Thanks to the player's club card, I received an amazing coupon that helped push me to explore what else the California has to offer.

Thanks to Yelp I decided to cash the deal on Market Street Cafe.  \n\nMy husband and I both ended up ordering the Prime Rib Dinner for $9.99.  I won't lie at first I was a little sad that I couldn't get the Ox Tail Soup barbecue they didn't serve it until later, but when I realized what a great deal the Prime Rib was I quickly got over the feeling.  This dinner not only comes with a healthy serving of prime rib with green beans and a potato (or rice), but you also get an unlimited salad bar and ice cream for dessert.  Granted my stomach really couldn't fit the ice cream at the end, but it is nice to have the option.\n\nI would have give then that last star, but there is always a line and they have a lot of time restrictions on some of the meals.  Also, don't be fooled by a short line because the line moves painfully slow. This is especially true when you are super hungry, so try to plan accordingly"

The busers serve you drinks and guess what, mine was not paying attention when he put my water cup down and it spilled ALL over me. WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS, ARLENE! Luckily, I had already put my Louis bag on another chair and was not wearing anything expensive. A supervisor came by to ask if I was okay, and I just said that I was fine and that it was just water. Of course, spilling a drink on someone is unacceptable and that set my mood for Market Street Cafe for the rest of the trip. Unfortunately for me, I was staying at the Cal and had meal vouchers for this 24 hour restaurant.\n\nOn to the food. The oxtail was NOT the absolute best thing I have ever had. Yes, it was fall off the bone soft, but it was so fatty. Plus, the ends were dark colored as if it is old meat. The soup is salty and they skimp on the vegetables. Also, for all the mess that we make eating the dish, I wish they would provide an extra small bowl for the bones. I like how they put the ginger and cilantro on the side so we can add it to our taste liking, plus I prefer no cilantro at all.\n\nMy favorite time to eat here is breakfast. Do not get their prime rib scramble since it is probably leftovers from the night prior. I like the made to order omelettes but my absolute fave is the Philippine breakfast. It comes with tocino! The busers in the morning come around frequently to refill coffee, but never asks to refill my orange juice. My last morning they tell me that it does not come with free refills. Well that was my first time hearing of that, and if my cup is empty, why wouldn't you even offer regardless of charge. Stay consistent people. I have gotten free refills on OJ before! I do not care about the charge. I just want to stay hydrated in the 101 degree weather!\n\nLines are long, especially at 11pm when the oxtail special starts, but it moves fairly quickly. The vouchers do not cover everything. For example, oxtail is a dinner voucher plus $2. Sometimes they apply less than $2 to your meal and you pay the balance. It's confusing. I probably would not eat here if I did not have to, even after my welcome bath!"

Fast forward a year and half and we waited in long lines each time, the service was slow and more than once we had to hunt someone down, and the food was never fresh or hot.

I'm sure I'll give them another chance when I go because of how cheap the food is."

I had the Philippine breakfast which consists of Tocino which is pork meat cooked in a sweet sauce for those who don't know, garlic rice (garlic on the side), 3 eggs over easy & some wheat toast with butter already on it. The Tocino meat was tender and melts in your mouth. I like mashing my over easy eggs with my rice. It was so good with the cooked garlic mixed up with my rice. Delicious! I had ice water to drink which saved us money on the total bill. Husband had the all you can eat breakfast buffet. It consisted of your typical breakfast stuff like scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, bananas, muffins, corn beef hash, etc. I didn't care for the buffet. I'd rather have Tocino, rice and my eggs over easy. Yummy! \nThe restaurant has plenty of room and a few waitresses working the floor. Waitress was nice. There are certain times where service can be slow because it's a Saturday and they can get busy. Weekdays are probably not as busy. This is a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner."

Instead, there were lots of traditional American dishes, which were good.  Just not exactly what I was looking for.  I got the hamburger steak patty with gravy, thinking it was more like a loco moco, but it was pretty much a salisbury steak.  I chose rice, and it was all pretty good.  However, the green beans I could've done without.  \n\nThe kiddo got the braised short ribs, and again, good, not great.  Could've been cooked a bit longer because they were a tad tough.  The hubby got the chicken fried steak, and it was, as you guessed it,  good.  I'd think it would be pretty hard to mess up chicken fried steak.\n\nService was efficient and friendly.  It was like my Lola was serving me dinner.  I actually felt pretty bad for asking for refills.  I had the urge to get up and get my own Pepsi, like a good grand daughter does for her grandma.

Then, pick your fork at the oxtail, the tender juicy meat just falls off so easily off the bone and plops back in the stew.  you then take the meat and dip it in this little dish filled with ginger and cilantro, but i take it to another level and squeeze some lemons onto the ginger with some Tabasco sauce to give it reggie's extra zing!!!!  this meal is totally cheap, and probably one of the best comfort food after a night of heavy drinking.  be warned, everybody around here knows about the oxtail soup.  when you get to the cafe around midnight, you'll notice a long line snaking out of the restaurant.  when you walk into the cafe, at each table you'll see at least one person with a bowl of oxtail soup.

When we were finally being seated, getting into the booth was an overwhelming fishy smell, the table next to us was eating the butterfish special.   I couldn't even think about what I wanted to order, I knew I wasn't ordering that though,  the smell was so horrendous, the women eating it even commented on how fishy it was. Yuck. \nMy husband and I decided on the oriental saimin soup.  We got the kalbi rib appetizer and our kids ordered chicken fingers and the mahi mahi sandwich. \nThe only saving grace of this meal was the saimin,  we ALL ate out of the two bowls.  The kalbi ribs were swimming in teriyaki sauce, without the sauce they might have been pretty good, the meat was nice and tender and easy to eat, however the sauce made it undesirable, they came with a little bowl of mac salad and don't know what kind of mayo they use but it left a weird aftertaste. The chicken fingers were your run of the mill pre-frozen fried strips, nothing special and not horrible but he didn't even finish one strip. The vegetables were ice cold as were the fries,  we just hate cold limpy fries. And the mahi sandwich looked good but my son didn't really care for it and I wasn't about to taste test it.  Salad bar came with one of the meals, we loaded a plate with a little of everything and little of everything was taken away. No good. Oh, and we had the chili with rice, the first bowl of rice was covered in oil! Waitress said it was butter, that's still disgusting. She brought us another bowl, better rice but it wasn't good Asian sticky rice. And the chili wasn't good either. \n\nSeems like we should have ordered oxtail soup by all the reviews but we'll never get to try it now since we won't be back. \n\nWe usually eat upstairs but it's been twenty years since we have eaten at the cafe so I wanted to give it another try.

This side of Vegas is definitely not anywhere near the atmosphere of the strip BUT I'm all about CHEAP & GOOD food. The reasons for knocking off the stars: the service wasn't all that great especially in the beginning I felt like we waited forever but I will say we were a party of 13 so I can't be too mad about that. I wasn't hella hungry & saw the big portions of the soup & everyone else in my party was ordering it so I went with the Korean BBQ sparerib appetizer. The flavor wasn't bad at all but I did wish there was more meat than fat on my plate & the texture was pretty tough. It did seem like they just bought and dumped Korean BBQ sauce on it than actually having marinated meat. The plate also came with macaroni salad that I was craving since they serve Hawaiian food but it was disappointing and flavorless. As for the oxtail soup, the flavor reminded me of Filipino nilaga mixed with a watered down beef stew a little sweet, salty, & savory. It wasn't like OMG this is the best thing ever BUT it wasn't that bad either. My family enjoyed it & appreciated that it comes with a side of rice but did say they all thought it would be even better if it was hotter in temperature & I did notice the meat easily falls right off just how it should if it's cooked for 96 hours! Now that I think about it, my plate as well as my cousins who ordered the Filipino breakfast  was served cold as well. Lastly, my boo ordered the mahi mahi and was not happy about it.. he'd give it 3/10 because the breading was basically only egg and the side seemed like old canned green beans."

And it's not just from the locals that are talking about it...it's from the native Hawaiians who are visiting or have relocated and all the other tourists talking about this infamous oxtail soup.  \n\nServed only after 11 pm until about 9 am or 11 am, you'll wait in line for a hour just to get a taste of it.  At $5.95 a bowl, you get two scoops of white rice, a few hearty chunks of oxtail and a light broth with carrots, peanuts and other good bits.  My favorite part - the ginger and cilantro mix they give you so you can toss all that shit right into your soup.  Yum!  And it's not a heavy dish...it's light and doesn't make you feel sick like typical late night fare does.  So, why only three stars then?\n\nWell, because it's only served after 11 pm and I'm damn tired when I get there.  And the line is always so long!  (I waited an hour last night for this stuff!)  They need to hire more wait staff so they could open up all the tables in this restaurant and get us all seated faster.  Everyone is in line just for the soup and nothing else.  Just take a look around you and that's all you'll see.  They won't allow you to take this order to go, which is just as well because people like me would call in an order of twenty soups and they would never be able to put up with the supply and demand of that!  This hotel is located in the downtown area, away from all the glitz and glamor of new Vegas.  So, if you don't have a car, you're less likely to make your way down there.  After a heavy night of partying, you can only hope there's at least one sober and awake driver willing to take you to the California Hotel and stand in line with you for this soup.  And also, if I'm sick in bed or just want to be a brat, I can't beg or plead for my boyfriend to bring this soup home to me because he can't!  Damn!  \n\nThe sad part about my first experience with this soup was that the broth was lukewarm.  This was disappointing.  When my sister and her husband ordered a second bowl, it came out piping hot, and what a difference!  I should have asked them to nuke mine a bit so I could have had that hot piping experience for sure!  Next time - I want it hot hot hot and another side helping of freshly grated ginger and cilantro please!\n\nUpdate! 03/29/08 - Went back last night after a long hiatus and I think I'm done with their oxtail soup.  (I can make it better at home!)  The price went up!  So now it's $7.95!  The line was short when we got there on a Friday night way after 1 am.  Sure, there's TONS of people ordering up this stuff, but I spent the whole time digging my teeth into the oxtail trying to pull the meat off.  Patrons were watching as the oxtail slipped from my fingers and fell into my bowl of soup.  By the time we left, I was in some major need of floss!  (Maybe I've been spoiled 'cuz when I make it at home, the meat gingerly falls off.  No gnawing necessary!)\n\nUpdate! 04/27/08 - Only went b/c my parents were craving the oxtail!  I had the Banana Fritters ($3.25), it came with four pieces of banana wrapped in wonton skins and deep fried, additional banana chunks, a side of caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with whipped cream on top.  The skin was way too thick on the deep-fried bananas.  The only saving grace was the caramel sauce and ice cream. \n\nMy dad had their $4.00 Half a Pound New York Steak, it came with vegetable, rice, fries, or mashed potatoes.  Not a bad deal for four dollars, huh?\n\nService - I never mentioned it before, but for the most part, the service is good.  The waitstaff are laid back and friendly, and a good bunch of people working here late at night.\n\n(Pictures are posted!)"

They have been raving about this place for the longest time, so when I finally got a chance to take a trip out to Vegas, I most definitely had to try out this place! You get such a huge portion. It's a big bowl of broth with about 5 or 6 pieces of oxtail in it and comes with a small side of rice. They provide some ginger and cilantro to add to your soup, & don't for get to ask for the chilli paste for a little bit of kick! The oxtails are so tender. I had to ditch the chopsticks and spoon, used my hands instead. Honestly, one of the best meals to end my night from a full day of drinking and walking around. Don't forget the floss because I had meat suck all in my teeth after this meal haha!\n\nI also shared an order of short ribs with my friends. Very very good. Great portion size but I felt like the sauce on it was a little too sweet for me. Overall, this is a great place to get a bite to eat. They have late night meal specials that are very cheap. Service isn't the best but the food kind of just makes up for it all."

This time around, heard they sell Zippy's famous chili, given I do like Zippy's chili, this is all I ever order from here.  Outrageously GIANT PORTION of Zippy's chili served for one person, I believe is enough for 2 people to get full from.  The Zippy's chili is one of the items available at no charge if using your meal coupon given with the Boyd's Travel Packages.  \n\nOne of many restaurants that does honor the Boyd's travel meal coupon.

So I figured she was having a bad day whereby we all have them but again when I went to pay my bill at the register, another lady looked like she got runned over or burnt out or even depressed. I asked the lady next to me \"everyone is having a bad day this morning\" and she nodded yes. I think she needs to be relocated to another work site like the kitchen. She have me my change and left irritated. Some workers needs to remember about who pays them and good customer service is a must even if you are having a bad day. I have no ill feeling with women but I do when you expect good service and you don't get it. \nOverall, the food was excellent and affordable but the staff needs some reality check.

I've eaten here every Vegas trip that I can remember and while the food isn't the best I still look forward going to eat at the breakfast buffet.\n\nParking:\nUnlike most Vegas hotels you actually need to get validation\n\nAtmosphere:\nNothing special here other then the hordes of Hawaii people ready to gamble. Your standard Diner feel\n\nService:\nSince 90% of the customers are most likely staying at the Cal and most likely have food vouchers that come with the Hawaii package then mostly everyone is eating for free. That tends to make waiters work a bit less then what you would expect at a normal restaurant. Watch out because at times there can be long lines & waits of 20+ mins. Do yourself a favor and sit at the counter where you don't have to wait.  Also watch out for shift change times(10:30-11pm) service can really really drag then.\n\nPrices:\nLike most restaurants in Vegas the prices are pretty good. Expect to pay about 5-8$ for most meals.  I particularly like going for the breakfast buffet for the best value. Sure you'll find some typical Hawaii food items(Portuguese Sausage!!) but for $6+ you can't beat it. Also be sure to look out for the late night NY steak which can be a good bargain\n\nFood:\nSo you get what you pay for, nothing is going to \"wow\" in the Market Street Caf\u00e9 but you should be more than satisfied if you're staying at the hotel and want to get a bite to eat. If you're not staying at the hotel and maybe you want to get some food that you might find in Hawaii then it's also a great spot. Just be sure to befriend a hotel guest and ask them to spot you some meal coupons.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Market Street caf\u00e9 has been a staple of Hawaii residents for decades and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Just don't expect  5* food and expect 1* service(unless you stick with the buffet).  If you're in town and want a bit of Aloha go check it out."

Just my DNA says I am!  \n\nRegardless, my bro was raving about this place months before our trip to Vegas.  So I had to try it.  Needless to say, it was yummy and phenomenal!  Oxtail is very fatty and gelatinous so if you can't handle that then this soup isn't for you. Oxtails have strong muscle fibers thus the meat itself, when slow cooked for a period of time comes out perfectly tender.  The broth is what really kicked it into gear for me.  Very beefy at least 10x more then regular beef stew I would say.  With some salt, pepper, and mixed vegetables this bowl of scrumptious soup was out of this world - well at least you can get it at one place!  \n\nThe place itself is inside the California Hotel off Fremont.  Very dingy and old hotel with coin slot machines; for the kids, coin slot machines predated paper money or voucher slots.  You can even stick them into what we call \"Pay Phones\" and make calls!  Who knew!  You get the point.  This place isn't full of bang and glam, but for a quick cheap play and some good ass Oxtail soup, it's worth the travel off the main strip - Enjoy!"

A typical diner open 24 hours with mainly Hawaiian dish. \n\nSERVICE\nMany of the workers here have +10 years of experience in the service industry. Experienced, yet it's the same ole task they do everyday so customer service is rusted, if that makes any sense. Not much attention to detail and constant waving down for them is a must. \n\nFOOD\nRule #1 here is always order their water with lemon. Water here has a strong chlorine taste. Otherwise, order their diluted coffee or sodas. \n\nWhen I say I have visited this place countless times, I mean +100 times over the years. I have tried almost everything on the menu. They have daily specials that are $8.99. Salad bar is good choice if you come in around the time their breakfast buffet ends (11 am) because that's when they switch the breakfast buffet with fresh salads.\n\nMy favorite and probably the most ordered dish is their prime rib. Comes with choice of white rice, brown rice, cole slaw,  baked/mashed potato, french fries along with green beans out of frozen package that you can find at any grocery stores. It comes with a dessert at the end, which is their vanilla ice cream. I ask for their prime rib to be cooked medium rare and comes out perfectly 90% of the time. They have multiple chefs there and some will cook your rare medium prime rib to well done. \n\nI also like their beef teriyaki plate. I like the flavor, albeit too savory for my liking. Beef used for this is always cooked to perfection. It's a small portion.\n\nChinese chicken salad is another one of my favorite. You can't really mess up on this but I appreciate that this is a big portion. Keep in mind this is always made freshly to order so it will take 15-20mins to prepare.\n\nOxtail soup. I personally am not a fan, but my company enjoys this dish a lot. Served 11pm to 9am and is a huge portion. It's one of the most popular dish here. \n\nCONCLUSION\nAs many other yelper states, come here for the oxtail soup or prime rib. Other stuff is mediocre."

Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to try their on tail soup because they only serve it at 11pm-9am (what the f time is that?) we don't get to come out that often. When we can, those would be the hours that you want to be at the bar or on the gaming table already! Don't waste your time coming all the way out here for what you can eat locally close to home. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who doesn't have too many nights I vegas."

I met a good friend from Toronto and he chose this place because the buffet to which we had planned to go at the Fremont was closed for renovation.\n\nThey still have a $9.99 prime rib special and that's what we both ordered.  It comes with soup or salad bar, baked, mashed, fries or other options for starch, and cherries jubilee for dessert.  I asked for the rarest piece of prime rib they had and I was off to the salad bar.  My friend got the soup of the day, a corn chowder.\n\nThe meals came quickly and my prime rib was a nice reddish pink color.  We both ordered baked potatoes and Sandra--our very 'Aloha' server--brought small containers of butter, sour cream, and horseradish before the dinners were ready.\n\nThis is not prime rib from some fancy, high priced restaurant.  It's a basic slice of prime rib, thin, but it had good flavor and it's quite a bargain for what you get.  The baked potato could have used a bit more cooking but it was otherwise OK.\n\nThe dessert, cherries jubilee, is simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some cherries in a sweet sauce.  While not the real thing, it was an enjoyable ending to the meal.  Since my friend uses insulin and can't have the ice cream, I fell on my sword and had both.\n\nWith Boyd owning this casino and picking up other properties around the valley, I'll go farther afield with my dining offers than just the Suncoast.  I enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nOur server, Sandra, was a gem!  What a great attitude and very friendly and welcoming!  There should be more like her.\n\nAloha!"

The only problem I had with being seated there was that the tables and chairs are so close together that I kept worrying that I would need to move my chair in for someone else to pass behind me. \nThe service was good. There was a mix-up between my order and my mother's. I had ordered a potato with my chicken tenders and she had ordered rice with her meal and they gave me the rice and her the potato. But it was fixed quickly and the rest of the meal went fine. The reason for the higher score was due to the food always being consistent and good, not the service. Our waitress only returned once after serving us our meals, to remove the dishes. I had to flag someone else down to request more water. \nBut, all it all, it's a good place to go. The prices are reasonable. The menu isn't extensive, but it is good sized. If you're Downtown, it's a nice place to go for a casual meal."

Most likely because, being located in the California Hotel, it caters to the heavy Hawaiian tourist clientele.  \n\nUpon arrival, we were dismayed that there was a long line wrapped along the entire corridor and our hopes were dwindling as the staff was counting off how many parties in each group and it seemed so out of reach that we'd be able to eat in this century. \n\nAlas, we saw the light at the end of the tunnel and was able to get seating right by the entryway.\n\nNot everything on the menu is offered at all times. However, they have this lovely section on the menu, labeled under \"Graveyard Specials\" (11 pm to 9 am) where we got a NY Steak for $6.99! I ordered the Oriental Soup Combo ($7.29).\n\nNow, I know you're probably wondering what quality of meat do you get for $6.99. Turns out, something overcooked and tough, with texture resembling muscle fibers.\n\nIn hindsight, we should have probably ask for it to be prepared Medium instead of Medium well, tis' bad 3 am judgement.\n\nBut looking on the bright side, it came with a side of fries and warmed frozen green beans, so it was salvageable(?).\n\nI had high hopes for the Saimin wonton soup. The noodles were slurpy and cooked perfectly, the broth was savory and warmed my soul, having sold it to the blackjack dealer earlier. The wontons were tasty morsels with hearty filling, however the wrapper had been soaked too long and fell apart in my bowl. The char sui was gummy, and inedible. The medium sized shrimp was appealing, but unsure if I could trust the crustacean, I passed on consuming it. Loved the fresh spinach in the soup, and ate some of the fish cake, but I've never been a fan of the artificial coloring of the fish cakes, even when I lived in Japan so, left some of those too.\n\nI think I'd come back and maybe try their other menu items as I do love Hawaiian food."

But nice didn't get us our food before people that got there at the same time as us Had already ordered, eaten and left.... We finally ordered, got our food maybe another 15 minutes after. At this point were just hungry, she then says \" I have a big party back there (I'm guessing the main dining area)  so it's okay if I don't come back\" I was confused at first and when she left I turned to my boyfriend and asked if she really just said that? That was a little much for me, I'm all about service and although she was nice, I still wanted to walk out. She was totally serious too, she walk by one time very quickly and said are you good and walked a way again.

All these dishes are nothing special and a little overpriced for what you're getting. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nGood ole' old-school Vegas casino diner.. the only thing missing is the Keno screens. You'll find a lot of Hawaiian people taking breaks from gambling.. usually a quiet buzz from these zombies needing to refuel. \n\nSERVICE:\nPretty quick service, you're usually right in & out of there.

The servers are always very friendly.. no matter how late into the night it is, they never lack politeness. \n\nTIPS:\nOxtail Soup!\nIf you're dining at the Cal during the day, you'll find far better choices upstairs at Aloha Specialties.. but during after-hours, this spot is solid."

It was already past midnight and we had come from LA so we weren't trying to drive around anymore.  Luckily, it wasn't as crazy busy so we were able to be seated right away.  Unfortunately, despite getting seated right away, we weren't attended to right away at our table.  Don't get me wrong.  The server was nice but when one is tired and hungry, niceness can only get so far.  \n\nWhen she finally made her way to our table, my sister-in-law ordered the infamous oxtail soup (now priced at $9.99), my brother ordered the wonton min, and I customized my omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon, & spam.  The food itself was okay.  Nothing to shout on rooftops about.  My omelette was okay, though the combination of spam and bacon made it super salty towards the end, since there were big clumps of them at the other end of my omelette.  The hash browns were okay.  Didn't taste the wonton min but my brother seemed to like it.  I did taste the infamous oxtail soup.  It comes with a cup of rice which my sister-in-law devoured.  The oxtail is cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone easily.  The broth is pretty good but I suppose that since I am Filipino, I'm accustomed to eating oxtail with a peanut sauce (a dish called Kare-kare).  So although the oxtail and the broth was good separately, together, I was looking for something more.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.\n\nDid I mention that our food arrived and we still had no drinks at our table.  When I flagged the waitress down and asked for water, she only brought one for me.  It wasn't until she noticed the shocked look on my brother's face that she made her way back with water for both my brother and sister-in-law as well.  Overall, I probably wouldn't eat here again, unless I had no other choice."

The Oxtail Soup is good.  And if you're around Downtown, it's probably worth stopping in and trying. \n-- Is it anything you can't get at home? Hell no.  \n-- Is it cheap?  Hell yeah.\nNote:  Oxtail Soup is only available as a late night special so you'll have to wait until 11PM for it.  The line gets a little long so be sure to bring something to do while you wait.\n\nDON'T EXPECT MUCH (i.e. MY LAU LAU STORY)\nIn addition to the oxtail soup, once I decided to push it and get a lau lau.  And naturally the taro & pork were dry & there was no butterfish, so being that I didn't have any poi, this didn't go down easy.\n...Nowadays, I usually just get a side of portugeuse sausage & rice.  Why?  Just because.  I think they serve Redondo's but I can't be sure.  It's not sweet so it's not Purity.\n\nCHEAP GRINDS\nIn any case, if you're used to the strip, this is going to be the cheapest meal of the week for you.  2 people can eat for $12 and change.\n\nGOOD BLACKJACK\nThey also have $10 3-2 Double Deck Blackjack here with typical rules (Hit on S17, Double Down any 2 cards, split aces up to 4) which you'll want to stick around to play for a while.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt's a good place to visit if you're from the islands or your just happen to be downtown around 11PM.  You can hit the tables and eat some local food at the same time.  Not bad.\n\n3-stars.\n\n---------------\nON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTE:\nAdmittedly, every time I go here, I'm checkin' out the crowd for local talent, but alas - no honeys ever show.  I suspect they're all at the Asian clubs like Tao or PURE.  Instead I see nothing but families with 4 kids & women in muumuu's that look like my Auntie.  Oh well... at least there's good soup and good blackjack."

For $9.99 I had about 8 pieces of oxtail, a rich  broth with really deep developed flavor.  The veggies weren't hammered to mush which was great.. Add the ginger and cilantro that is provided into the broth it is well worth it..  Its also served with rice that I put in at the end to make sure I got every drop of that broth.\n\nThe only reason they're not getting 5 stars is that the service is a bit spotty but if you're willing to wait a bit for a truly excellent bowl of soup it is well worth waiting for.\n\nI will definitely be back"

The only thing is, they actually don't offer it until after 11:00 pm. Everyone in my party was disappointed because we went to downtown for that particular reason. \n\nThe place was kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the California Hotel. Because of all the renovations, the entrance is actually blocked by a large tarp. The wait for our large group took a long time, and when we were finally seated we saw at least half of the place empty. \n\nThe staff on the other hand was very helpful and tried to accommodate everyone. \n\nI ordered the Philippine breakfast which did not disappoint. It came with tocino, rice and eggs. \n\nI also ordered a side of macaroni salad which tasted really bland. I was excited because it is after all a Hawaiian themed hotel so I figured they would at least have good macaroni salad. \n\nI will probably come back for the ox tail soup because everyone can't stop talking about it."

Thats mainly because the place is usually packed\nPrime Rib- pretty good for casino special prime rib (much different from the steakhouse variety). My recommendation is if you want medium rare ask for rare, want medium ask for medium rare, ect. I learned the hard way by asking for medium well a couple times and I got what most outside of the caveman era would consider well done. \nSalad bar- at its best average at its worst,  umm lets just say cousin Eddie from Vegas Vacation migh\nt consider it to cross contaminated to dine from. \nCherries Jubilee- this comes with special. Its a large scoop of vanilla with heated cherries on the bottom and whipped cream. A really nice addition to the special and though I'm not a big dessert person I do enjoy this little bonus. \nIn summary if you want a meal that is going to be a great value and get you full in a no frills environment then MSC hits the spot. Also I assume the Oxtail is great because every time I'm there half the place is chin deep in that stuff"

I HAD to order it, it was so CHEAP. But now i see WHY it's so cheap. Unfortunately, the last few steaks that i've ordered have been from Ruth's Chris, Maestro's, and Donovans. So I HAVE to say (and this shouldn't be surprising) that I was disappointed. I like at least 1/3 of my steak was straight up ligaments. I spent at least 10 minutes chewing one bite. My jaw was hurting after 30 minutes (aka after three bites). So i  ate the veggies (green beans). They tasted like they were microwaved. So then I stuck to my rice. No one can ruin steamed rice. Or can they? (just kidding, the rice was fine).\n\nI feel bad giving a low rating, because shouldn't you expect such CHEAP food to not taste good? Whatever, my food experience just wasn't a good one.

One ordered steak and eggs, the other ordered a breakfast special. It was your typical breakfast, nothing extraordinary. But what was awesome were the prices! They also have daily specials, which I opted to get. I ordered the Island Short Ribs for $7.95. It's a large serving of braised short ribs in their absolutely delicious sauce. Fell right off the bone and not overly sweet. A side of veggies, brown rice and macaroni salad also came with the dish. I'm picky about my macaroni salad, but Market Street Cafe does an amazing job to get the macaroni salad just right. \n\nI hear that the oxtail soup is still served during late night hours.

It's a 24hr cafe serving typical breakfast/burger type meals while offering diversity to the menu with their Ox tail soup, silogs, and $5 dollar steak specials. keep in mind they only serve the real cheap eats late night.\n\nMyself I ordered up the Loco Moco. It came in large soup bowl with steamed rice, a beef patti (1/2lb), fried egg, and gravy. Giving you a heads up this meal is the reason for my write up. Compared to other joints they're making it happen flavor and quality wise better. Beef Patty tears into beefy chunks, the rice is steaming hot, and the gravy gives that depth of comfort your looking for when you eat Loco Moco Bruh! This meal is not gonna spare you on calories or sodium but if it's your last meal on earth then you went out like a soulja...Again not a chef but let me emphasize the gravy has character. I'm thinking it's stock based and possible butter if not drippings added for richness.\n\nOther dishes sampled\n\nOx tail soup, just the broth for me tho. Warm, chinese spiced broth w/ hints of star anise. Chunks of carrot and celery to add sweetness and color. The broth is not served hot enough for me to order, I would need it to be piping hot. The Ox tail cuts served were on the large side. Noticed smaller cuts of Ox tails are usually more tender in most cases, my preference.\n\nPork tocino or tocilog. This was actually pretty good too. Chef grilled that sliced pork until it caramalized the way it outta to be. It's gets better, if your an eggs feign they serve the meal with 3 instead of 2! If your wondering what's Tocino it's marinated cured pork, usually thin sliced pork butt or possibly thick cut bacon. This should be approachable if your not into filipino food.\n\n$5 Steak Special, 8oz grilled NY Steak strip with fries and string beans! If nothing above motivates you this might.\n\nNot much too say about the decor of the cafe other than outdated. However, the place speaks for itself. It's easy to picture how it probably boomed back in the day. Looking at the staff they probably been here since. Service was not bad, the waiter kept an eye for us and filled up the water whenever needed. Friendly, nah, you can tell he just wanted to do his job and get out.\n\nParking is easy, ffree lot across the street, cafe is located on the ground floor, possible waiting time if your coming after hours\n\nCheck it out if you get a chance"

I can't understand why there is a long line to eat here.  They do give out $7 coupons in the hotel and casino and I think that's the reason this place is so crowded. People will eat horrible food for free or for a few bucks.  I didn't have a coupon.  I tried the salad bar and the saimin.  The one item in the salad bar that I was expecting to be good was the mac salad and it was horrible.  No flavor whatsoever.  It was bland.  It needed some salt and some egg.  The mayo didn't even have an egg flavor like Best Foods mayo.  The saimin was advertised to have char sui and fish cake.  It was 3 paper thin sliced of komobuko and 3 small nuggets of char sui.  My mom had the mahi mahi that was battered in egg and fried.  The batter came really dry. I looked like egg foo yung but the egg was way over cooked.  My sister had the prime rib and she asked for it medium instead of the typical medium rare that the roast is cooked.  The meat had a grayish tint to it like they put the steak in a microwave to get it to medium from medium rare.  The meat was tough.  Just a poor cut of meat.  We ended up going to the Aloha Specialties upstairs to get something decent to eat.  Don't go to this cafe."

Don't bother with the menu. Although it looks decent. Go for the soup.\n\nThe soup is only served after midnight and is $8.95. Your choice of White or Brown Rice. \n\nCouple quick notes:\n\n1. Service is good. Waitstaff is attentive and refills your water/diet coke regularly.\n2. The food is solid. THe soup had a VERY flavorful broth, with a good amount of oxtail. I \"murdered\" my soup. Nothing was left but empty bones.\n3. Soup could've been piping hot. It wasn't cold by all means, but it wasn't ridiculously hot like at most other joints.\n4. Although I skipped the menu, I later found out that there are other deals here. Worth checking out. But only after you try the oxtail soup.\n\nSo hop to it. Thank me later.

We trekked it over to the downtown Fremont St area in the middle of the night after a good night of clubbing. This place is located in the California Hotel. We kinda didn't know what this place was called. We just asked a worker about where to find the oxtail soup and he pointed us to this direction. 3:30 in the morning and still a line - we waited about half an hour to get seated. There were plenty of empty tables though - I think they were trying to stagger the parties to alleviate the service and kitchen from getting overwhelmed. But yeah it still bugs me to see that they had the capacity to be able to seat us much faster. I learned that this area and this restaurant too tend to cater to the Hawaiian crowd. From the d\u00e9cor to all the restaurant and shops, it's like their home away from home.  Even the menu at this restaurant had a bunch of Hawaiian dishes. So yeah, we ordered a whole round of oxtail soup for the table. Some people shared and they were smart. So much meat! It's 4 pieces of giant oxtail and fat in a broth with a few veggies, a side of cilantro and ginger and a bowl of rice too. So good and worth the wait, I suppose. The meat is a bit fatty but super big and meaty and fall-off-the-bone delicious. The broth is surprisingly not too oily which is good to slurp up without guilt. And the rice helps with a different texture. Noodles would've been super delicious with the soup as well. We were starving after a long night and I don't anyone finished, not even the guys with their huge appetites. It's only $10 for a bowl.  That's a steal. It's like a pound or two of meat and oxtail can normally go for like $5+ per pound. I can't vouch for the other things but oxtail soup that's only served from 11pm to 9am is super good."

They also have a good salad bar which is popular too. Prices are reasonable here too. They also have midnight specials the most by far popular item is the oxtail soup."

Not a i'll be right with you no water, no drink order nothing for 10 whole minutes. I dont care how good a restaurants food is if the service is bad its not worth it for me. Once our order was taken it didnt take long at all. The oxtail soup was delicious except for the oxtails which were very tough. They needed to throw them in the slow cooker or something they also needed to trim the big ones, so much fat. Now i could eat the broth, veggies & rice by itself it was really good. It came with cilantro, ginger & rice on the side for you to add in yourself.  The giant bowl of soup was $9.99 well worth it, u cant buy oxtails at the grocery store for that price, trust me i know and they give you a bowl full of them, not stingy at all.

They also ran out of oxtail soup by the time we were seated (which is what everyone seems to be raging about). We did get there at 4:30am, though. I like that they serve loco moco at 4am - after being at a club for 5 hours it's a pretty exciting feeling to see that on a menu. Also the tocino and fried rice combo served all day made me a little less grumpy about the $18 taxi ride from the strip just to find out that they ran out of oxtail soup. Aside from the garlic rice and tocino (which was bombbb), the food was just ok. Might go back to try the oxtail soup, but it's definitely not first on my list of places to eat in Vegas when I visit again."

I don't have the time to make it up to Downtown Vegas from the strip, but this time, I was with family during our roadtrip and we decided to stop by this restaurant for dinner. My brother and dad had already gone, so I knew it was a really affordable restaurant. I had pretty low expectations, but after waiting in line for 20 minutes on a weekday, we finally got seated. It thankfully didn't smell like cigarettes and the restaurant was super cute and had a retro classy hotel feel to it. \n\nThe value of the food here was amazing! There were a lot of different choices for $10 meals, but the majority of us picked the $10 prime rib special where you get the unlimited salad bar, potato side (mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, french fries), vegetables, prime rib, and dessert! My boyfriend ordered their $10 country fried chicken steak with mashed potatoes and a corn with the salad bar (no dessert). First of all, the salad bar was so delicious! It was almost like Souplantation, but actually better! Their macaroni salad and imitation crab salad was very Hawaiian and delicious. They even had a broccoli dish where it literally tasted like the Joan's broccoli at Souplantation. I definitely had my full at the salad bar, but then the actual main course came. \n\nThe prime rib with juice and green beans were absolutely amazing. The medium rare was perfect for me and the green beans were definitely buttered up or something because I couldn't stop eating them. Then the dessert came, which was just a vanilla ice cream with cherries syrup and a little waffle cone chip. Overall, this was a great bang for your buck restaurant with a great ambiance!"

I will have to disagree because I found something even better.  The Butterfish.  No, this fish is not extinct, but growing up in Hawaii eating this on special occaisions (or at least i considered eat it a special occaision), I feel like i have found heaven again.  I had it for 3 meals during my 4 day stay.  It is absolutely imperative that you eat it OVER two scoops of rice...yes let the fish and the sauce soak into the rice and then dig in...if you don't know what I am talking about, i don't know what you're doing in the Cal, cause it would mean that you're not from Hawaii!!!\n\nSeriously, i was craving the butterfish here even more than the King Crab Legs at the Wynn Buffet.

Maybe because the hostess was by herself and sat people in the back of the restaurant. I was starving and thirsty so I noticed this a lot more. We were seated and had our waitress come up and give us menus. Another woman came by and took our drink orders. She seemed nice and helpful. Our waitress was a bit standoffish and seemed grumpy.  I ordered the saimin because it reminded me of home and I haven't had it for a while because I live in South Carolina. The saimin was a huge amount for the cheap price. It didn't have much flavor to the broth so I added a lot of shoyu and mustard. It came with wontons in it that wasn't mentioned on the menu because I figured you would only get them if you ordered the wonton min. It could have been better but it was just got enough to settle my craving for Hawaii food. I wish Their laulau special was on Sunday instead of Thursday. That would have been a better treat. Overall a good restaurant for the price. The service was ok but could have been better. And the saimin needed a bit more flavor."

Some of the workers aren't the nicest people also. I went here last night, and there was a total of 4 of us. We ordered one oxtail soup, a side of fries, and a side of bacon since we weren't super hungry. We asked for an extra plate, and the server told us it was $2 for an extra empty plate. So we just said.. \"Oh ok, never mind then. Thanks.\" So my one friend ended up finishing the oxtail soup. Ok, no big deal. Of course when we get our check, they end up charging us the $2 for the extra plate that we never got. Immediately we brought that up to our server especially if we didn't even end up sharing. I can tell that she didn't wanna deal with it. Right away, she asked us if we wanted to talk to the manager. We addressed the issue to the manager. She said (I kid you not), \"Nope. Sorry, you're gonna have to pay for it. There's 4 of you and 1 entree.\"...... and she walks away. I know that it's only $2, and I wouldn't have minded. It was the way that they approached us that frustrated us. \n\nAfter coming here quite often, I would say that I am satisfied with the service half the time, and the other half, we end up walking out pissed off.......

Market Street Cafe has been a favorite eating spot of mine for a while with its daily specials as well as taste of the food. However my past few experiences have been terrible with them. The last time I was here I ordered the Cal prime rib I asked for rare and what do the give me medium then a few days ago the waitress service was bad super slow had to wait long time for the food and by then lost my appetite. When I mom asked for a box the waitress took 15 minutes to get one her response was \"There were none in the kitchen I had to grab from the storage\" to me that's unacceptable if the supply get low restock it hello common sense don't wait last minute. Well there were other things but it's not appropriate to say here but next time I'll eat at Local Specialties upstairs or eat the Main Street hotel buffet or Fremont street buffet!!!!!"

I think they have Loco Moco for like $5 or $6.99, oxtail soup for $8.99, steak and mashers for $4.99 (which come with long beans or you can substitute the whole thing for fries, my personal favorite! chicken fingers and fries (with the choice of honey ranch or regular ranch, I recommend the honey ranch. It's soooooo delish.) and sausage and pancakes for around $3 to $4.  Come on a Weds night, they usually don't have a crowd and graveyard starts around 12.  You might want to avoid coming on the weekend, it's hella hectic with people.  \n\nThe taste for the oxtail soup (if you're from Hawaii) isn't all that great, so don't expect to much out of it.  It's nothing like the flavor in Hawaii, but it's a mock imitation.  The service here isn't too bad, my friends ordered our food 5 mins and our food came out within 10 to 15 mins.  On a busy night though, be prepared.  It'd take a long time for your order to be placed.  But the servers are nice, and sometimes when you're lucky you might get a local server from Hawaii. Now those people, are a character.  They always never fail to remind me of home. ^_^"

I am Asian and have been spoiled by the amounts of oxtail soup I have eaten in Orange county, California.\n\n Parking was free for me because the gate operator was gone. I did see signs about validation requirements throughout the parkinglot. The only plus is that they serve oxtail at after-clubbing hours, the downside is that it is served at after-clubbing hours. The oxtail is MEDIOCRE. The broth is too salty and the oxtail itself was a bit dry. If you are Asian or familiar with oxtail soup then you will be disappointed about the oxtail soup here. If there is a line to be seated then it isn't worth it. I arrived at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday and was lucky to be seated right away. If you come after 11:30, you will probably have to wait in line. I would recommend you to just find a pho (Vietnamese soup) restaurant and order oxtail from there."

Sometimes it is so salty you end up eating all the rice with just a splash of soup. Sometimes it is heaven-on-earth perfection. And when it is good, it is very very good. This would definitely be a 4 or 5 star review is they could just stick to the perfect Goldilocks medium every single time. \n\nThe service is perfectly fine, a little aloof, but at this hour they do a perfectly pleasant job of dealing with the drunkards trying to pre-empt their hangovers with oxtail soup. \n\nWhenever we go out in downtown, I secretly wish that someone suggests getting oxtail afterward, because every time, I hold out hope that the soup will find that perfect balance."

This is the reason you see long lines forming right before 11 PM. You will always see a line, and there's a reason why.\n\nAs you get seated down in this packed restaurant, you can see everyone eating out of a bowl, sopping up spoonfuls of broth. The melody of slurps swells in the air and it's almost unanimous what should be eaten here.\n\nThe oxtail soup is a savory dish with a rich broth and meaty chunks of oxtail. It has flavors of both savory and sweet inside the fatty meat. \n\nFor those who never had oxtail before, don't be afraid of this dish. Think of it like eating some delicious, tender beef shanks. The bone-in flavor seeps into the meat, making the broth and meat that more delicious. It's something you have to try.\n\nThey also have other delicious items that go for very cheap after the 11 PM hours of the night: the chicken strips & fries, New York Steak, Won Ton Min. Okay, so they aren't the best you can eat, but they are still good, and with being able to buy all three of those dishes up top and not top $15, that's pretty damn good.\n\nThe place is a good bargain for late night eats if you're out late gambling or drinking. Of course, the oxtail soup is the way to go, but with prices so low, you're free to explore other dishes at cheap prices. Just remember to always have the dishes hot."

Everytime I eat it, I try to think what ingredients are making that delicious broth. Their prime rib dinner for $9.99 with soup or salad bar and dessert is a steal also.

            "review": "First time I came here was over the summer of last year. Boyfriend was craving Oxtail soup and wanted me to try it since I have never had it in my life! \n\nIt was a little after 2:00am when we arrived here, and no joke this place was hopping. The line was long and the wait was about 15mins to get a table. Everyone was there from old to the very young. The hostess was nice as she sat us toward the back of the dining room. Now I am not one to complain about where I eat, but some of you might turn your nose up and the place. First of all, this is not new Vegas, its old Vegas. Things are well taken care of in this place (think Denny's) but have an older feel. They have midnight specials, which cannot be beat by anyone else around town! Cheap prices on good cooking!\n\nOur waiter was nice, as he brought us water and our silverware! Boyfriend ordered two bowls of their oxtail soup and two sides of rice. \n\nWhen the waiter brought our bowls to the table, all I could think was. How am I going to finish all this? There sitting in front of me was a piping hot and smelling delicious oversized bowl of  the tenderness looking meat sitting on the bone (psst don't tell anyone but I found out that it isn't really ox meat it's the meat from a cow)with cilantro, carrots and mushrooms.\n\n The side bowl of sticky rice was piled high. The rice was okay did not eat much of it, but the soup was fully loaded with flavor definitely leaving the bones in makes the broth that much better. \n\nSince this was my first time eating the meat from the soup, I was not as graceful as my boyfriend was while eating it. Instead, I tore into it with a knife and fork and when that did not work, I used my fingers to get the meat off the bone. Yes, I am not happy to admit that but just could not think of putting the bone near my mouth and chomp chomping away at it! \n\nNot 100% full we decided on having a little sweet snack before leaving. Ordered the banana fritters, which were pretty filling as I could only managed to eat two before being totally full!\n\nMake a note people before coming here: Oxtail soup is not served during the day it is only served after 11:00pm...  \n\nThis place is totally worth going to DTLV for late at night!"

The soup was plenitful and came with a side of rice. It was good, but definitely not the best.\n\nThe saimin soup was good, but again, not the best. It tastes kind of like Vietnames Hu Tieu, except a little bit blander. This is good for after a long day/night in Vegas.\n\nA bit far from the strip.\n\nAnd the 11P-5A specials aren't that cheap....."

            "review": "My friend has been raving about this place, specifically the oxtail soup...so we decided to make a stop at midnight. Make sure you call in advance just in case. They start serving at 11pm, but I guess they have ran out before. You don't want to make the trip all the way out there for nothing. \nLocation/ambience: dive cafe located in a grungy Asian-dominated hotel in downtown. A type of place I would go for a specific dish and that would probably be it. I could totally see this place in Triple D. \nService: lots of older Asian servers. Pretty friendly. Our service was fast   Apparently the wait could be really long on some night. No complaints today. \nFood: the server knew right away what we were after. 5 oxtail soups. We also threw in a NY steak plate since it was only $6.99. Soup came out with. 5-10 mins. Good size portion with 3-4 big fatty pieces of oxtail. Also comes with 1 big scoop of rice and side of cilantro and ginger. The soup base flavor was delicious. I love how the cilantro and ginger favors accompanied it. There were some veggies included. Once u dump the rice in, it becomes a very hearty stew. The oxtail was a tad tougher than I would have liked. I wonder if we had come in the early morning, would it have been more tender (longer cooking time). It also got s tad messy trying to extract the meat from the bone. But the flavor was just so good. Every bite was delicious. You definitely get food coma after. The NY STeak was just ok. But for $7! How can u complain. \nValue: I thought was excellent. $10 for this dish in Vegas is good and worth it. \n\nI kinda wish that this place was closer...but then again they would be charging $19.99 for it. I would definitely return."

Don't even order anything else. I'll let you know right now that the blueberry pie is awful. Just stick with the soup.\n\nFor $9.99 you get a humongous bowl of three large oxtails, all bathing in a tasty broth with a medley of vegetables. The oxtails are meaty and fatty. Forget being prim and proper while eating. Leave your table manners behind and start grubbin'. \n\nService isn't the greatest. You have to flag servers down if you need anything, because they disappear once your order has been delivered. \n\nThe soup is what really keeps people coming back to Market Street Cafe, but if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't return. 3.5 stars."

Not the best but by far not the worst. The cilantro was a bit wilted. The rice could use improvement but if you're hungry for oxtail soup, this is the place to go to when in Vegas. Just remember, AFTER 11:00pm or before 9:00am. It gets crowded so if you're craving it now make sure to get there before 11:00pm."

VEGAS'S MILLION DOLLAR OX TAIL SOUP HERE!\n\nI don't want to blow up the spot but sharing is caring so here goes...\n\nIf you think eating a big bowl of Pho is perfect after a night of heavy drinking, imagine that satisfaction...TIMES A THOUSAND when you're eating a bowl of hot, delicious ox tail soup!  Never again will I go to Vegas w/o getting my soup fix here =)\n\nThe broth is deliciously salty and perfect, with generous portions of tender meat that falls off the bone.  (I love it when people aren't sheisty with the meat!)  They serve it with cilantro and tons of minced ginger and served piping hot.  Ask for chili on the side and dump your rice in the soup and mix and *sluuuuuuurp* GET YOUR CHOW ON.\n\nOnly $9.95 and served only at night...only catch is the time so don't forget.  Starts at midnight until 6am PERFECT for the after spot.\n\nI love (method man voice) THE CAAAAAL!  Sure, it's packed w/ senior citizens but who better to gamble next to than some veterans??   Pit bosses and dealers here are AWESOME too friendly and chill... They comped us 3 FREE SOUPS when we spent a few hours playing blackjack =)   that was the best $100 bowl of soup I've ever had!\n\n(get hawaiian shaved ice upstairs w/ vanilla ice cream yum for dessert)"

The soup has that rich flavor letting you know that its been simmering for hours and hours. The broth is rich, without as much grease or fat as you'd expect. Its well seasoned, and the herbs in it just add those nice little accents as you slurp it down. The meat on the bone is delicious. My fiance cleaned all of her bones bare. \n\nThe rest of the food isn't quite as special, but isn't bad. The price is reasonable, the service is okay, its open late, and you have more of a chance of winning at the casino outside than on the strip so that's a bonus.\n\nBut seriously...oxtail soup. Bam!"

It always has been a comfort spot to eat at simply because I'm from Hawaii, and hearing all the pidgin and seeing all the Hawaii folks as I eat my saimin drowned in hot mustard (not the kind of hot mustard that literally tastes like mustard), causing me to put my hands on my forehead as I go into convulsion until the hotness wears out. If you know, you know what I'm talking about. Good stuff.\n\nLines can be pretty long but to me, for the most part...moves at a good pace. Service isn't so bad either. Out of all the million times we've been...it's been pretty personable. Never had a rude waiter/waitress. Has a decent menu similar to foods found at a Dennys or some sort. However, I'd prefer to eat here over a 'Dennys or some sort' because of the other food options like a tocino breakfast, zippys chili, and specials like their miso butterfish. Us Hawaii folks living out in the desert always appreciates some nostalgia or likeness to home. \n\nThey have pretty good walkway space between tables so if you must bring your stroller in, don't feel afraid to do so. If you got those.humongous double side-to-side kine strollers...leave 'um brah.\n\n4 stars for offering oxtail soup and zippys chili and zippys style spaghetti. But overall, it's a 3.5 stars spot. If you aren't in the vicinity, there's no need to rush on down...unless you're in the vicinity and you've had a night of gambling and drinking while family is in town, and need some soup to sober up. =D\n\nThen I'd definitely recommend. Enjoy!"

The broth itself didn't even taste like it came from the oxtail but more like an added can of beef broth.\n\nIf you're Vietnamese and eat Duoi Bo aka Oxtail, yeah, it's pretty much that, except 4x the price and a bit bland.\n\nThey gave a scoop of rice which was interesting and threw some peanuts in there.\n\nService was nice."

The menu has just about everything you could want!!!  ......breakfast items, burgers, sandwiches, prime rib, steak, \"Hawaiian food\", etc.   And as mentioned, the oxtail soup is great!!   The lines are usually pretty long for this place, especially late at night, and I think it's because it's one of the few places in Downtown that's open all night.   Not to mention that the Cal and Main St. usually give out coupons for this place to certain guests.   And did I mention the cheap prices???\n\nThey also have a breakfast buffet that isn't bad.

Supposedly if you have some kind of coupon book it's pretty much almost free for a lot of things(all the Hawaiian tourists):\n\nCame here with 2 other couples and here's what we ordered:\n\n- (2) oxtail soup: I only tried a spoonful but the broth was flavorful, generous portion of the oxtail itself. Tender, fall off the bone goodness was the consensus. Was it worth it? Yea for $10.99-not bad\n\n- chili and rice: this was good, I thought it had too much beans but that's just a personal preference. I don't know what Zippy's is but supposedly that's who makes it(?)\n\n- New York steak: comes with a side of green beans(probably from a can) and mash potatoes with gravy. Cooked medium rare. I didn't try it but bolt other said it was Meh. \n\n- Won Ton Min: Saimin with pork dumplings-I didn't try it but the friend said the won tons tasted like a ball of \"dough\" nothing special \n\n- Island short ribs: braised ribs in their homemade house sauce. Omg this was soooooo good! Super tender and flavorful. Served with rice and canned green beans. The mister devoured it.\n\nGive it a go!"

If you get the special you'll have soup or unlimited salad bar (simple but nice-some romaine would be nice but it's iceberg).  You get a potato, veggies & Cherries Jubilee for dessert!  $7-9, wow.  It's usually busy but worth the wait.  If you're looking for elegant or people hanging on wires to get your wine from the top of a wall, this is NOT the place.  If you want simple food at a great price, downtown, then this is THE place."

I never even tried ox tail before in my entire life, but their soup is sooo good!!\n\nThe thing is they are only selling these items during their graveyard special, which is form 11 PM to 9 AM. Right before 11 PM hits, there will be a long line of people waiting to be seated for the specials. The hostess usually is not the nicest, but our interaction is only about 10% of the time we are there.\n\nI'm pretty sure they up the price since six years ago, but the quality and the quantity of the ox tail soup is the same. The broth is so rich and it's perfectly paired with mushroom, celery and carrots. I can't really finish the whole portion, so you can definitely share - just get an extra rice. Ask for hot paste too and dump it in the soup, with the ginger juice. \n\nDefinitely one of the things I have to do when I'm in Vegas."

It's the place to find some Zippy's chili too by they way. =) The other local hawaiian food on the menu is good as well.  Great salad bar.  Staff is always friendly.  The only thing about this place is that the oxtail soup comes out ONLY @ 11pm.  Would be nice to drop by anytime of the day to eat it whenever you want."

The wait for parties 2+ seemed a bit longer since we were led to a table right away. \n\nService was pretty mediocre, it took 10 minutes before someone even greeted us and another 5 just to order. Also if you're used to drinking fresh water in Hawaii I beg of you not to drink the water here!!! I thought people were over exaggerating when they said it tasted like pool water but seriously... it 1000% does, yuck. My throat still feels nasty.\n\nThe oxtail soup had a massive amount of tender, fatty oxtail compared to Hawaii where it's so expensive and you only get a few pieces. The soup was average and the veggies weren't cooked cooked long enough, bummer for all you mushy veggie lovers like myself! The cost definitely outweighs all the cons - only $10 for this huge bowl of awesomeness.  Perfect dish to regain energy and warmth :)\n\nAll in all its a great bang for your buck, not sure if I'll I'll be coming back since there's so many other unique restaurants to try in Vegas. But if you're in the mood for something familiar and comforting (all my Hawaii peeps) I recommend this place!"

NY steak for like $7. Oxtail soup for $10.99. I had heard so much about their oxtail soup so I had to try it. Around 1030pm people are already lining up for the oxtail soup. The soup was lukewarm so definitely ruined the whole experience. I like my soups boiling hot. Aside from that they are very generous with the portions of oxtail. The oxtail is huge and very tender. The broth was clear and flavorful. It comes with a side of rice. Definitely should substitute it with ramen instead ! \n\nMy bf ordered the Oriental Soup combo. Comes with noodles, wontons, fish cakes and vegetables. The broth was savory. \n\nOverall the food is okay. The prices are very reasonable. Their service is okay. Cant expect much because they are always so busy. If im in the area I might give it another try but I wouldn't make the drive out here if I was staying on the strip. \n\nParking is $3 I believe.

Definitely worth the $8 regular price and at a Vacations Hawaii coupon plus $2 it's a no brainer!"

First I waited in line to order fries to go and the lady told me I had to order it at the counter when she could have told me that 5 min ago when she knew I was doing a take out. So I went to the counter and ordered my fries and stood there for about 10 min. I saw the fries come out and the lady came up to me and said I had to go pay for the fries up front. So I waited in line and told the lady I wanted to pay for my take out of fries. She said I need the receipt. I told her the lady didn't give me a receipt. She told me that I had to go get it. So I sent my boyfriend to go get it. That lady told him that she gave me the receipt when he was with me and we both know that she didn't give me the receipt. So I told the lady at the register that she didn't give me a receipt. She told me \"then leave\". Then the lady who took my order came up with the receipt and the French fries and said \"oh I didn't give you a receipt?\". So I told her no she didn't and she appologized. Then the lady at the register acted like nothing was wrong. When she literally told me to leave when my fries were already done cooking and all they needed to do was pay for it. All of this just happened about 10 minutes ago and I am very disappointed.  45 minutes waisted for just a take out of fries and rude service.  Not to be rude but some people think they can talk to you the way they want just because they are older...."

With so many bars and hotels in the area though, we figured we would just wing it and see where the alcohol took us.  The one thing we knew for sure though was our last stop of the night - Market Street Cafe's famous ox tail soup!\n\nNow I know - when it comes to post drinking/clubbing food, the usual suspects that come to mind are classics like burgers, pizza, and burritos.  But ox tail soup?  A little unexpected...much like the line!  Parked in a corner of the California Hotel casino, it was pretty surprising to see so many other people there.  I guess that just shows how popular they are for late night eats.  \n\nThe roughly 20 minutes it took for the three of us to get a table seemed agonizingly long since we were so hungry, but the wait was worth it.  None of us really had any expectations, but we all thought it was pretty solid (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pd2Xo1WqNic9zxLTVdilGA?select=nkKSBXcNq1bxA1jC_6wCZQ).  The meat tasted great and it was oh so tender - so easy to pull it off the bone!  The broth was flavorful despite being on the lighter side, but I thought it could have used a little more richness to it.  Still, not too bad as it was.\n\nThe rest of the menu looked decent from what I saw, and I especially liked how it offers so many island/Hawaiian dishes (they have saimin!).  Definitely a good late night food option, but it's a shame that it's not closer to the Strip!  Then again, if it was, the lines would just be that much longer..."

Open 24 hours offering delicious Hawaiian food and breakfast buffet for under $10, you will feel like you hit the jackpot! \n\nIt's a tradition that my family and I come here on Tuesday mornings for their yummy breakfast buffet. Why Tuesday? Because coming to Vegas Columbus day week early Monday morning has been a tradition for us for the past few years. On Tuesday, the boys hit up the golf course while the ladies hit up downtown Vegas for good food and fun slots!\n\nBreakfast buffet is under $10 a person and offers a variety of stuff to choose from: Ham, sausage, eggs, rice, bacon, biscuits, gravy, hash browns, fruits, corned beef hash, oj and coffee...oh my! One plate and you're stuffed (unless you're like me and must have two plates!). There is usually a wait in the morning but it goes by pretty fast. The food is good for being under $10. It's not to die for and not the best or gourmet type but it's good. \n\nI typically waddle out of here and waddle my way to the bar for a bloody mary...then I waddle my way to a slot machine and stay put for about an hour. That's when you know you're in food coma!\n\nI'm happy with this place and I shall return later this year! See you in October!"

This was seriously the most unprofessional demeanor a supervisor has ever bestowed. She started talking amongst herself and getting crazy. Anyway, if you ever bump into this lady, beware... The security was even mentioning to us that she always calls security on any little incident. They too were mentioning that she was crazy and a waste of time when security is called.\n\nOther than that, the oxtail soup is normally delicious.

Those are the only two items I've tried here, so this review goes to them. \n\nGiving it 4 stars because although the soup is only $10, you need to take a $25 cab ride from the strip to get to the restaurant.

She couldn't say for sure as, not surprisingly, both hotels used the same product but encouraged me to try it anyway. So I ordered that along with a stack of pancakes. As it turns out, the sausage was pretty good while the pancakes were just okay. The meal did serve its purpose, keeping me filled for several hours. \n\nIf you're already staying at the California or Main Street Station, or just went on a long gambling run at either, it's probably a decent, convenient choice to get some grub.
