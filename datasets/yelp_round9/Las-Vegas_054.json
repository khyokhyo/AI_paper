This was better by default simply because Harbor Palace dim sum was unpalatable.\n- Orchids' waiters were quick to fill our requests and the push-cart waitresses paid lots of attention to us (in some LA dim sum joints if you're not Chinese/don't speak Cantonese the push-cart folks sometimes just ignore you).\n- Hopefully there's a better Vegas dim sum place I'll come across but until then this'll do."

This place does the job, but it's not my first choice. \n\nWe came in a group of 8, so I got to try a lot of different items. I was a bit disappointed that the radish cakes didn't come out hot and freshly fried. Some of he dishes had been microwaved, and even had Saran Wrap over the plate, which they removed only after you pick it. \n\nThe wait was only 5 minutes on a Sunday at 11am, so I think that's pretty good. I'm not sure if there was a standout item for me. Oh, the chives dumplings that are round and flat were my favorite. \n\nFood comes out quick. We were bunch of fatties with eyes bigger than our stomach, so by the end, htere was enough leftover to create a combo dim sum meal for dinner. \n\nThe price came out to $28/pp after tax and tip. I believe gratuity was included as we were a party of 8. Never seen a $240 bill at dim sum before, but there's always a first for everything. \n\nGood note: this place has dim sum ALL DAY"

The dim sum is ok, definitely not the best I've had. But considering that this is Las Vegas and that there IS a dim sum option available, I would rather have ok rather than nothing.\n\nBesides, they still use the old school carts that roam around the restaurant. Major props for that!"

Good thing food is right in front of you and ready to eat because I was HUNGRY.  The ladies that work the carts of food around the restaurant are friendly and helpful, even though they are persistent in trying to get you to buy more.  I usually eat dim sum in Westminster at Seafood Cove (previously Dragon Phoenix).  This place's dim sum was better, in my opinion.  Not as salty and leaving you parched for lots of water as Seafood Cove.  All in all, a great place to eat with family while in Vegas.  We order a lot of dishes and were completely stuffed. The bill was $160 before tax and tip."

WHAT?!? \n\nI can't complain about the different shrimp and pork dumplings that they serve. \"I'll try dat!\"\n\nTheir chile sauce has good kick to it. HIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!\n\nThe two items that stood out for me was the roasted duck and tripe. The roasted duck has the perfect crispiness to it accompanied with the perfect amount of fat. Every piece was greaZy and flavorful. MMMMM MMMMM!!! The lady gave me a hint. If you end up getting two orders of the duck for dim sum, just order a half duck on the regular menu. You'll save $4. EYE LIKE!!! NAAAAAAAAS!!! HOW MUCH!!! The tripe didn't change my life like how the roasted duck did, but the slight bitterness of it had me ordering more.\n\nGood food for sure.  I love to frequent this place. Thanks yallz for serving dim sum all day. ... These guys deserve at least 4.\n\nHIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"

Its very busy on the weekends and we went during lunch time so I was surprised. The food was pretty fresh considering they sit on carts for a min before being served out.  Selection of food was pretty good, disappointed a few of the traditional dim sum plates were not brought around but I guess every dim sum restaurant is slightly different. \n\nService wasn't bad, maybe it was because we had a Chinese speaker with us but I have to admit that compared to most dim sum restaurants the service was a lot faster here than at most. \n\nI would go back."

            "review": "I've been here twice during the day and twice at night. I definitely prefer dining during the day since the restaurant is much busier, so the food is fresh and there's a better selection. Unfortunately, I get a hankering for dim sum and we can only visit for dinner. I'm sure it's fine during dinner if it's busy, but I seem to keep missing the crowd. During our last dinner visit, the dim sum was cold and had obviously been out for some time. I didn't mind terribly, but I would hate to have that situation again.\n\nWhat continues to draw me back here is the service. It's much, much better than service I've received at other dim sum establishments. I'm not ignored and the carts visit often. Also, they're very accommodating when I ask for a dish and it's not available on the carts. They even inform you of how long it'll be for the dish to come out.\n\nThe food is all right. It's not the best dim sum I've had, but most of the dishes are decent and still hits the spot when I'm really craving it.\n\nGroup A ($2.40)\nSteamed BBQ Pork Bun\nPan Fried Daikon Cake\nDeep Fried Meat Ball\n\nGroup B ($3.20)\nBaked BBQ Pork Bun\nSteamed Pork Spareribs\nSteamed Chicken Feet\nBaked Sweet Cream Bun\nSteamed Pork Shiu Mai\nSteamed Shrimp Dumpling\nShrimp Har Gow\nPork Porridge\nSteamed Beef Ball\nBean Curd Skin Roll\nShrimp Pasted Eggplant\nBaked Egg Tart\nSteamed Soup Dumpling\nMushroom Shiu Mai\nChiu-Chow Style Dumpling\n\nGroup C ($4.25)\nFried Shrimp Ball\nFried Shrimp Puff\nSticky Rice in Lotus Leaf\nShrimp Rice Noodle\nBeef Rice Noodle\n\nGroup D ($6.25)\nChinese Broccoli \nPan Fried XO Noodle\n\nI like the Pan Fried Daikon Cake, Deep Fried Meat Ball, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Pork Shiu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Bean Curd Skin Roll, Fried Shrimp Puff, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Beef Rice Noodle, and Pan Fried XO Noodle.\n\nI don't mind their other dumplings, but they're just okay. Not the best skin, but good fillings. Daikon (Turnip) Cake is one of my favorite dim sum and although I'll still eat theirs, it's doesn't have the best texture and it's slightly mushy. I like the flavor of their Pork Spareribs, but there is so, so much fat in relation to how much actual meat is available. I also don't like their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun as it's really dry. Stick to their baked version if you want Char Siu Bao. The only dish that I really don't care for is the Steamed Beef Ball; it's such a weird texture. \n\nWe spent a little over $50 for two people (including tax and tip). You tend to spend less money with groups of 3-4 since you're sharing more and tend to get less food overall. Also, most plates come with 3-4 pieces."

Well, it's been awhile since I went back (except recently) and of course, the service still lacks. I feel like the waitresses are always grumpy here. Can't even smile.\n\nThe dishes are good, to me, because I really like the noodles and the crispy shrimp, but those sure add up. I've already found a new dimsum place to go to now, but the service here is pretty depressing. I feel like I have to climb a mountain just to be noticed sometimes."

If you go on the weekend it gets busy around 11 and usually dies around 1ish. Sometimes its not that bad if it is busy because then the carts are always moving and passing you. Sometimes when it is slower you might have to wait longer for what you want to come around."

Yes!\n\nWhen it comes to dim sum, I have a specific set of items that I order. I love shrimp. If it has shrimp in it, I must have it.\nWhen it comes to dim sum, my husband has a specific set of items that he orders. He hates fish. Loves meat. If it doesn't have fish, and just meat, he must have it.\nCould I tell you the exact name of our favorites? No clue - but I could describe it:\nshrimp dumplings, some shrimp dumpling with green stuff in it (chives maybe?), shrimp ball with a sugar cane in it, har gow (I goggled this so that IS the actual name). For my hubs, he loooooooves the BBQ pork buns and the sticky pork buns!\n\nNeedless to say, we do not share what we order and after coming to Orchids Garden  over 4 times, we have the place down to a science.\n\n#1 Come early. I have never been to this place on a week day and I have never been to the place over an hour from it's opening time. I read the reviews of the place, and I immediately learned that I don't think I would enjoy it as much in the middle of the week or for a late lunch. I have already noticed the difference between their Sunday service and their Saturday and have learned from friends' experiences - Sunday morning is the best time to go.\n\n#2 don't order anything from a person who's cart is almost empty. The cart ladies work hard and if most of the stuff is gone from the cart, it's safe to assume that they've been around the block a few times. I have made the mistake and had lukewarm shrimp balls and no- they are not good.\n\n#3 A friend of mine had said they had a bad experience because almost every minute someone stopped by their table with cart asking if they wanted something. I think he was complaining that it was hard to have a conversation when they were being interrupted repeatedly. My advice to my friend was - don't go to dim sum then. Dim sum is all about the food. In my opinion, the expectations should be a variety of hot food readily available to you when you sit down. It's not about how friendly the lady pushing the cart is, or how many times you were bothered after you were clearly full.\n\nI am a regular at Orchids Garden because of it's easy-to-get-to location, consistency of food quality, and most of all - the price. Plus, our water glasses are always full, the bathrooms are clean, and we never have to wait to get our bill.\n\nWhile there are plenty of great dim sum places around town (Ping Pang Pong to name one), Orchids Gardens is my go to spot for early afternoon cravings. It hasn't let me down once."

Surely a testament to what sparse options there are when it comes to dim sum in Vegas because the food was just so-so. I remember thinking the ingredients did not taste very fresh and seemed of low quality. The one dish I did like was the smelt, though it was overly fried. Trying to think of what else we had and am having trouble, it was that unmemorable. Old building, musty old dining space with outdated carpet. Think we'll try somewhere else next time."

I leave the ordering to my husband who knows what most things are by sight but not by name.  I know which ones are my favorite and will tell him which ones to try again.\n\nYou can't go wrong with shrimp dumplings, roast pork rolls, deep fried taro fritter and anything with eggplant! We usually load up and eat ourselves silly before the third cart comes around!  \n\nThis place serves plenty of fresh dim sum, has fast service and easy to get in if you come early!  But be warned, we have come just as the doors opened only to miss out on some of the choices when they get busier, so your timing to arrive will influence your choices, so slow to eat, take your time, and enjoy."

NOTE: If you do not have a car and are staying around the Strip area, this may be hard for you to get to. It is about a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip in a random shopping center.\n\nWe came this past Sunday a little after noon and the place was packed. However, we must have only waited 5-10 min. tops before being seated!\n\nI love dim sum places where they push around all of the different dishes on little carts. There's something satisfying about being able to see your options and pick and choose what you want, and having it brought straight to your table rather than selecting from a menu book of pictures of all the different dishes. \n\nThis place had a great selection of dim sum! We got a TON of different dishes. From what I can remember, I saw:\n\nha/har gow\nsiu mai\nwu gok\ncha siu bao (baked + steamed)\ncheong fan\nlo baak gou\nfung zao\ndaan taat\njin deui\ndo fu fa\nlai wong bau\n\nWe got lucky and were seated right by the kitchen, which was awesome because we basically got first dibs on all of the hot and fresh food that came out of there! \n\nI also liked how frequent the women pushing the carts came by. I felt like I was constantly checking out the carts and the dishes, and there was always a decent amount of food on our table. I've been at other dim sum places where it seems like you have to wait forever for another person to come by with a different cart. They were on top of their game here!\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Orchids Garden. Would definitely return whenever I'm back in Vegas. Worth visiting if you love dim sum!"

Off the Dim Sum cart we tried deep fried meat dumpling, steamed BBQ pork buns, pork Shiu Mai, coconut bun, and Chiu-Chow style dumplings. Thought maybe it was just the Dim Sum that wasn't that great, so decided to try a few dishes from the regular menu. The regular menu was a bit better. Tried the Moo Shu pork, Kung Pao beef with peanuts, and the dried scallop with egg whites fried rice. The regular menu is huge with many dishes to choose from. Very busy and popular restaurant."

I used to live in California and growing up, there were plenty of dim sum restaurants that were very good, but as I've gotten older, quality dim sum was harder to find. I've been here twice. The first time, I went mid-day and service was great! The ladies with the carts were coming by our table every few minutes. Our water/tea was constantly refilled and the staff was very friendly.\n\nThe second I went, it was around 9:30pm and I'll be honest, I was expecting the dim sum to be old and perhaps dried out. To my surprise, the dim sum was still fresh and tasted delicious! Again, service was great at this hour and the staff, always so friendly."

This is authentic Chinese Dim Sum and Dim Sum service if you do not know what you want by the looks of it you will not get much help from the cart ladies they are polite but curt and will just start handing you things.  I know that is a bit of an oxymoron but most who go here will understand.  Please do not let this deter you from enjoying the goodies they serve in their little tins of goodness.   I know what I want by looks and name so that is extremely helpful in these kind of situations! \n\nMy thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.  It seems as of late the word has gotten out because there are more and more people from other ethnicities visiting here they now just bring a fork instead of having to ask for one (I do not ever need one though but I know some of my friends and visitors do)  I also noticed a lot more smiles from the cart ladies as of late as well!  LOL I kinda like the grumpy, curt all about the food service of the past a bit.  However the food does not lie I do enjoy the Dim Sum and will continue to come back on a regular basis.\n\nI have never even looked at the menu so I have no idea what else they have but who cares really its Dim Sum all day! \n\nOne tip I have learned from my boyfriend and his family in my many years, is drink the hot tea even if you are in Vegas and it is 116 outside, it helps digest the oils from the food and calms your stomach."

I informed my friend that dim sum is a combination of Cantonese fast food except them come to your table in carts and each server tries their best to sell you what is comparable to \"Tapas or appetizers.\" I pick the traditional dishes and guess what my friend chose? He picks out \"Chicken Feet,\" brave soul! Anyways the food is average, the portions are smaller than East Ocean and it's a little pricey.

The only other dim sum place I've been to in Las Vegas was Ping Pang Pong.. and they were pretty good but expensive.\n\nAnyway, went on a Friday afternoon for lunch. It was about 1pm and it was actually quite empty. We got seated, and right away, the ladies are coming around with their carts full of delicious dim sum. I have the hardest time ordering stuff here because in Hawaii, we call everything by a different name! Its so confusing! haha.\n\nWe ordered:\nChicken Char-siu Bao (manapua!) - I thought it was good, they are mini and the filling wasn't char-siu but it was some sort of chicken. \nShrimp Half moon - I really don't know what the chinese name of this is, but in Hawaii we call it half moon. \nPork Hash - They were small but I thought they were kind of oily.. but good!\nShrimp Rolls: I call it look fun back home, but none of the ladies knew what the eff we were talking about. It is the shrimps wrapped with a sheet of rice paper with shoyu type sauce poured all over it. This is my favorite thing to order. \nEggplant w/Shrimp Paste: This was kind of cold by the time we got it, but it was ok. I ordered the bellpepper stuffed with this paste previously.. but I like the eggplant one better.\n\nThe service is quick. If it is not too busy, the ladies will come up to you every single time they come around.. even if you said you didn't want what was on their cart. We had to ask a few times for the shrimp rolls in the flat rice noodle, after about the 3rd time asking, the lady went to find that cart and brought the dish to us. \n\nAfter about 6 plates, out bill was under $20. I've been wanting to try some other dim sum places.. but I like Orchids because its a big space and the dim sum is pretty good."

I've had dim sum from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Canada, Seattle and other areas and this place is not bad in comparison. Its tasty and price is reasonable. The only downside is with typical dim sum place is the queue when you arrive late. Be there at 10.30am and you will be served instantly. Arrive at 12pm and you may have to wait more than 30 min depending on the weekend. Since they serve dimsum all day long, I went and tried one time in the evening. You have to order from the menu, and the variety is not as good as the brunch. The taste is a bit off too, kind of expected. I recommend this place highly."

We ordered the regular dim sum fare and although their dim sum weren't as good as the ones out in Los Angeles, it wasn't bad.  The carts came around quite often and the food was fresh and hot.  They also had quite a large selection of dim sum items.  Their shrimp dumpling was a little on the small side.  Although their small dim sum are only $2.10, they have quite a few items that cost more than that. So, when all is said and done, the two of us spent over $30 for dim sum.  The next time I have the urge for dim sum, I will definitely come back and try some of their other dim sum items."

This as good as you are going to find for Dim Sum in Las Vegas. \n\nUnlike Cathy House, and other Chinese establishments in Las Vegas, the Dim Sum is prepared throughout the day, so you will get fresh, and not reheated, Dim Sum when the carts come around.\n\nI always do the Dim Sum. My wife used to order Chinese entrees, until she finally realized they were not that good, and switched back to Dim Sum. \n\nThe place is large, and at lunch time, very loud. Dinner is a little less hectic.\n\nService is on the slow side. In the Asian tradition, don't be affraid to raise your voice to get service at your table, or they may ignore you. \n\nThey don't expect much of a tip, and don't appreciate a generous tip. Many of the Chinese patrons dont' tip; it's a cultural thing. \n\nIf you are on a date, and want to impress someone with your knowledge for \"off the strip\" or \"local\" places, or simply to introduce some one to Dim Sum, this is a decent bet.\n\nIf you are thinking of impressing someone with atmosphere, and deep conversation, go to Tao, a Rich Man's PF Chang's."

Also the BBQ Pork buns, whether you go sweet or not are amazing.\n\nI routinely come here and eat far more than I need to. The only draw back is that not enough people come here so the carts aren't always popping out fresh stuff, so things can become luke warm.

The dining area is very large, I was quite surprised. They do Dim Sum all day, which is awesome. The ladies who go around to the tables know what is in each of the dishes too. That's unusual for some of the places I've been. \nWe ordered egg rolls, shrimp in lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken & chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, nothing to write home about which is sometimes a good thing. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little more soupy than we expected, but it was a new dish to us so it was worth a try. The sweet & sour chicken, though, was AMAZING. I have NEVER had such tender chicken in my life. I seriously asked the waiter if this was really chicken. He laughed & said yes. I was completely blown away by how delicious this dish was. For that matter alone, I would go and will go back again. \n\nGreat service, amazing sweet & sour chicken & Dim Sum all day! Plus it's 5 minutes it from my house. Gets a good review in my book!"

Don't usually recommend sitting by the kitchen anywhere else, but its a prime spot for dim sum restaurants as you get the first picks/selections and everything is steaming hot.\n\nTotal with tip was $35 for 2 people.\n\nThe selection was certainly there and could of tried much more...aka spring rolls, veggie dishes, stuffed green peppers, tofu dessert...etc but 10 dishes for 2 people was 'pant sized-up' enough...lol.\n\nCertainly far from the best Ive tasted but passable to get your fix in."

The food is pretty good but I can't say it's my favorite place for dim sum.\n\nWhat's good about dim sum is that each dish is inexpensive and you can sample a variety of food. I always get Chinese broccoli, shumai, BBQ pork buns, stir-fried noodles, shrimp wontons, shrimp balls, minced meat balls, sesame balls...and whatever balls they have. These are my favorites and what I would normally get at any restaurant that serves dim sum. Their shrimp wontons aren't the best. \n\nNow, what really turns me off with this place is that they nuke their food in the microwave. I love roast pork and that's just one of the best examples of food they microwave. The meat is warm but the skin gets chewy, no crisp and just unenjoyable.\n\nThe key to a good Chinese restaurant is the service. If the servers speak good English and are friendly, go somewhere else!"

During lunch time the prices are way better than going later in the day I believe after 3 or 4. I recently just went this passed weekend and we had a party of five adults and 1 child and we pretty much all stuffed of dim sum, soy sauce and hot tea for 38.37. I was stuffed. I will be back!\n\nWhere can you find a place that serves dim sum all day?"

Although I've lived in Las Vegas or 5 years now, this is officially my FIRST Dim Sum experience in this city.  We came here to celebrate Chinese New Years last night, so Kung Hee Fat Chow.  Or Gung Hee Fat Chow, depending on your dialect.  \n\nThe outside of the building transport you to an authentic city in China.  Chinese lettering and a huge sign that read, \"Dim Sum all day\" really brought us in.  The carpet is definitely outdated, older tables as well.  Adding yellow lining lights on the ceiling and you're now transported to 1960's China.  Definitely needs a revitalization.  The staff is cordial.  Definitely not as pushy to sell you more Dim Sum as I've experienced in other cities.  They also explain the dishes thoroughly in English so you know what you're getting.  Here's what we got:\n\nChow Mein - probably like 4 plates altogether.  A little oily but so good.  Small crispy noodles with grilled onions.  \n\nFried Shrimp Puff - Got 3 plates of this in all.  Crispy gyoza like dumplings filled with shrimp.  Super yummy!  Served with a dollop of mayonnaise.    \n\nJuicy Pork Dumpling - Watch out!  The juicy liquid is hot so don't just stick it in your mouth so quickly!  Perfectly steamed.\n\nSteamed Pork Shiu Mai - Reminds me of pork hash from back home in Hawaii.  LOVE.\n\nShrimp Shiu Mai -  Exactly like the pork, just with shrimp.  Still love.\n\nShrimp Paste in Green Bell Pepper - They actually shaped the paste into a ball and placed it on top of a big square of steamed bell pepper. The pepper was a little odd.\n\nPork and Chive Shiu Mai - SUPER OILY.  I had to wipe it down with my napkin.\n\nAll in all, a little too oily.  My hands were constantly oily all night.  Not the best experience, I've had better dim sum.  Don't take my word for it.  Please come by and see if you feel the same!"

You just gotta. Well here is my take on this past experience:\n\nPersonally, I thought food was average/ could have been much better. We came here when they first opened and things were fresh and delicious. This time around, not the same. The Shao Long Bao (Pork Mini Buns) were dry and nasty. The rice wrapped in lotus leaves tasted a bit odd and the Shu Mai and Chicken hands could have been much better prepared. Something just didn't taste right when I ate it. Maybe it was just a bad experience this time around? I mean we do come here often when we visit Vegas. So for now, I suppose I give them a 2.5/3 for their decent food. I'll be back, don't worry! I'll let you know how they hold up :)"

It'll stand up decently too in San Francisco, where I'm from.  It won't be the best place -- but it'll be a place I'd frequent regularly for the quality and value of the food.\n\nWhy, you say?  Cuz their baked goods are, well, GOOD!  Try, for examples, the miniature baked BBQ pork in a buttery, flaky pastry.  Love it!  The miniature egg custard.  Well done!  The crust is good...  the custard... well, they could use a little more egg whites.  But in any case, their baked goods are excellent!\n\nHar gow, Shumai, Lo mai kai, fried shrimp dumpling, chicken feet, cheung fun (you know, the regulars), these all are pretty good.  I stuffed myself with 5 plates and it cost me $12.50 + tips.\n\nOne last thing...  I haven't tried Chang's yet -- I'm going to.   But as far as I'm concerned, Orchid Garden is as authentic as it's going to get in LV.    I walked in, for the first time, one Sunday early afternoon and was greeted by the loud clanging of chopsticks against plates and the familiar hum of hundreds of loud conversation melded into one -- now that's an authentic dim sum joint."

I've had it a few times in Houston at various spots, but this was by far the best dim sum I've had. \n\nWe had many many types of dumplings. Some with mushrooms, most had some sort of shrimp or pork in there somewhere. Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. One of the surprise favorites was a platter of rolled up \"wide noodles\" (damn I wish I knew the name of them!). They looked like tripe or something icky, but trust me - order them! \n\nSo if you're new to dim sum and want to give it a shot, this place is an excellent place to start. Our check came out to $35 for 2 of us, but we got disgusting amounts of food. I'm too embarassed about how much we ate to sit back and tally up how many pieces that must have been!"

Our party was seated really quick and there were a bunch of people eating here. It is a traditional Dim Sum style restaurant where you get the cart ladies strolling by promoting their food. While the quality is definitely not on par with the 626 in California, it was decent and the service was quick. Not sure if speaking Canto helped, but god damn they came by immediately and if one of the ladies didn't have what we wanted, the manager or hostess near by would place that order on the quickness.\n\nWe orders all the usual items, like shu mai, and hai gow, which like i stated above, was decent, i've had way better back home at many other places.

There's no time to waste on Dim Sum Sunday! They clean your tables pretty fast too, but don't let them rush you. Enjoy it.\n\nMost places use a lot of sesame oil in their dim sum items, not Orchid Garden. You leave satisfied... full.... but not wanting to sit in stretchy pants.\n\nTheir pork buns (the ones in my picture) are lightly brushed with honey. The bun is fluffy and the pork isn't too \"saucy\". The mushroom shu mai is my favorite over the regular shu mai. It actually tastes like there is meat inside. If you're a fan of eggplant, try the fried eggplant (seen in my picture).  I'm not a huge fan, but even I loved this tasty morsel. The red bean sesame rolls are unreal - crunchy outside, steamy chewy inside, and the slightly sweet bite of red bean in the middle. The seaweed salad is meh. STick to the dim sum items and you can't go wrong.\n\nBe sure to check them out and remember it's meant to be eaten slowly! Sip that tea, digest, and grub down. ;-)"

The Shrimp Har Gow not as good, the outer layer was too thick. Shumai was good. We got a few other items, I don't remember the names, those were mediocre. See photos. \n\n- Pass on the pork buns, sesame balls -- better quality at Diamond Bakery in Chinatown. \n\n- The fried rice and calamari were better than I've had at other dim sum and Chinese restaurants. Fried rice was oily and made fresh. Calamari pieces were huge and had a nice flavor to it. Those were my favorites among the non-dim sum items. \n\n- A little a cheaper on some items than the last dim sum restaurant I went to (in LA.) Our bill came out to $40, more than enough to feed 3 people and have left overs. \n\nWe came in at the right time. esp during Dec. TV was airing Star Wars A New Hope. \n\nTIP: keep track of what they stamp on your ticket. Sometimes, they accidentally charge you for more than you ordered. This happens at most dim sum places. \n\n- We went yesterday, Saturday (Dec 17) around dinner time 5pm. It wasn't busy. \n\nFree tea was delicious. It was either chrysanthemum or jasmine tea. We asked and she said it a few times: \"chrysanth-jasmine.\" If you ask again, you'll most likely get the same answer. haha.\n\nBONUS: Get a free cute Chinese calendar during December, while supplies last."

There are variety of dim sum choices, and as you enter the restaurant it's already packed with people.  This mean that it's really good.  The good thing about it is the diversity of people that enjoys the dim sum there.  Furthermore, the waitresses knows how to speak English really well!! This is the only place that I've heard clear English being spoken!! Awesome!!!!"

The bbq pork bun, the pineapple bun, and the other pastries were fresh. These were probably the freshest tasting baked dim sum goods I had ever had. I don't even know how to describe it, but it was really good. They also had really awesome chicken feet. The chicken feet was my favorite dish especially because after I ate it, I didn't feel sick from all the grease. It was not very greasy. Normally, at dim sum restaurants, the chicken feet is fried heavily and comes out extremely greasy. I normally can't eat more than two at best, but I definitely could eat more. The shiu mai was good too, although it was a little on the tiny side compared to places in LA. It is not that expensive and is definitely a good place for dim sum in Vegas!"

I am so glad that we did!  The dim sum is reasonably priced and the selection is abundant.  I would best compare it to Happy Day Chinese Restaurant on Waialae Ave in Honolulu.  FYI, Saturday lunches are always so busy!  Expect to wait a few minutes to be seated.\n\nIf you are looking for more \"authentic\" dim sum, then this isn't it, although they do have their fair share of dim sum from chicken feet in black bean sauce to steamed char siu bao.  My kids enjoy the shumai and the rice wrapped in lotus leaf the most.  But what they really go there for is the sweets!  Lotus bean jin dui (sesame balls filled with lotus or red bean) is ever so present there, just like in Hawaii (yay!).  And often, but not always, they have the cart going around serving you this sweet tofu dessert.  It's a freshly made silken tofu served hot in a sweet ginger-infused syrup.  I'm not sure what they call it in Chinese, but the cart ladies go around asking \"sweet tofu?  sweet tofu?\"  I know it's made there fresh, because the owner (I think she is one), always reminds us (she knows us that much) that a fresh one is being made ready in 5 minutes or so.\n\nThe one thing we would love to see happen is Orchids being open for morning breakfast/brunch.  In Hawaii, it is common to have dim sum for breakfast.  But here in Las Vegas, not so common.  Too bad.\n\nThe staff is friendly, as friendly as any Chinese restaurant staff could be...if you haven't been to a Chinese restaurant, don't expect too much in polite, unhurried style of service.  They don't speak English very well, but I would still recommend to stick it out and try it, or just go with someone who knows how and what to order.\n\nIf you're from Hawaii, you will probably run into a few local residents who used to live in Hawaii.  That's what I like about Orchids...feels like as if we were home again..."

Food is kinda greasy/oily even for dim sum! I've had my fair share of dimsum, and don't get me wrong, I love me some msg & enough oil to make a dish taste good, but you don't have to overdo it to the point of feeling discomfort afterwards. \n\nIt's loud, there's always a wait regardless of the time of day, and good luck getting any kind of minimal service here (& I'm not expecting much service at dimsum anyways). Last time I was here, a server lady poured soy sauce on a dish from three feet up (slight exaggeration but hardly). It splashed up from the plate (duh), but there was no change in behavior from server or apology for her actions. \n\nHowever, having said all the above, if you're craving dim sum, this is the place to satisfy it, sadly. \n\nSide rant: Can we start a petition to get rid of the loud banquet hall style Chinese restaurants? Like some quieter ones where diners don't have to shout to each other to be heard would be awesome."

Seems to have caught on with many other people, as the clientelle today was a huge mix of people: Asians of all types, Hawaiians, and Caucasians. Don't even come here on a holiday weekend as you will wait for about 30-45 minutes (we did that once- we won't make that mistake again).\n\nIt's still yummy! We had the chinese broccoli (steamed just right), sio mai, shrimp balls (mmm, another favorite), shrimp on the sugar cane (one of my hubby's favorites), pork buns (another hubby's favorite), egg tarts (one of my favorites, but then I saw the sesame balls... darn), and rice cakes (love this!). I had the hot tea (good stuff, so fragrant) while he had water. We didn't finish everything- we had leftovers. Less than $26.00 plus tip. Maybe next time we won't wait so long, to come again.  (BTW, there's way more other dishes (noodles, chicken feet, tripe, rice, wide noodles with shrimp, soup, etc.) that they have- the ones that we get, just happens to be our favorites.) \n\nThe service is very good. We were seated right away, maybe because were just a party of two. The server brought us drinks right away (and refills too). Although, very busy, the servers are pretty quick, pushing the heavy food-filled carts to every table in the restaurant. Some of them speak english, some do not. If you're not clear (repeat yourself) you might get another dish by mistake. They stamp your card accordingly after you make your selections. When you have empty plates or containers on your table, someone comes over and grabs them. \n\nThere are two sections to the restaurant. A bathroom is located in the lobby. There are TVs all around, but because there are so many diners, you only just see the screens and can't hear them. But that's ok, because you're in the company of good eats! \n\nThis place has been around for years; the name might have changed a few times, but the food is still top notch. Definitely still The place for Dim Sum. I'm getting the sesame balls next time instead of the egg tarts."

We ordered the crab balls, siu mai, egg tarts and from the menu, house special pan fried noodles as well as chicken fried rice. \n\nOnce they arrived, we stared at our plates as the food glistened in all that oil! No doubt it tasted pretttttttty good! The crab balls went perfectly with the fried rice and the egg tarts were a great way to end the night. With a cute serving of 3, my parents and I had one each! \n\nAtmosphere was pretty mellow. It gave me this deep sense of nostalgia for Hong Kong where I lived for 18 years. The service could do with some improvement although I would understand that working a whole day wouldn't really motivate a smile. Just a little less on the cold approach and I'd probably give this place a 4.5 :) \n\nOverall, it was a pretty pleasant experience, comparable to HK star only with more variety on the dumplings and reasonable prices throughout the day (HK star shoots up its prices for dinner)"

After 5 more of these bad experiences, we knew we won't be going back even though it was the only place we knew that had 24hr dim sum. The service is typical rude Chinese, and I'm Chinese. Sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting. Recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu. We never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the \"complainers\". It's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside.  Thank goodness my mom knows her math, cuz I just pay a bill when I get it. Well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it. When we forced them to re-add, they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing. They corrected the amount, put it on the table and walked away. We definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go, keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill. And if it tastes wierd, it's probably spoiled because they have all day dim sum and the crap may have been sitting out all day."

I would stick to the main dishes which dim sum places excel at. \nA variety of dumplings (we tried the fried pork and chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns, pan-fried pork dumplings, and glutinous rice footballs with meat): all of the dumplings were good and satisfied the grease and meat craving that we all had after a Friday night out. My favorite was the glutinous rice footballs, which are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and contains a bit of pork meat on the inside as well.\nChinese broccoli with seafood sauce: quite good. It was nice to have a purely vegetable dish, but the veggies were coated in oil so I'm not sure how much healthier they are. \nSiu mai: delicious!\nXiao long bao: on the small side and not filled with much delicious broth. I've definitely had much better XLB elsewhere. \nZhong zi: quite good, but again not filled with as much meat and goodies as I have had elsewhere.\n\nOverall service was fast and efficient, and the value was great ($63 to feed 6 of us, so only about $10 a person for everyone to be pleasantly satisfied but not uncomfortably full).

No smile, takes the order, deliver the food, and the check after flagging any server down. We are both Asian and  we can't think of any compelling reason to return."

The price is inexpensive for dim sum, and conveniently located for students attending classes at CSN's Cheyenne and Charleston campuses.\n\nWe usually only go to dim sum between 11am-1pm, so have not encountered issues with dim sum being cold. The food we typically order are usually served hot or warm, unless it is supposed to be served cold.\n\nThe variety of selection is comparable to most other dim sum restaurants.  The quality is average, nothing that blows away your expectations, and is a good value for the menu pricing.\n\nIs it the best quality dim sum available in Las Vegas?  No.\nIs it good dim sum for the price?  Absolutely!"

I noticed that they have Dim Sum all day which is weird to me since most places here stop serving Dim Sum around 2 or 3pm. I've been to a couple places that are popular here in town, but most we tried never left a good impression by the end of our meal. The last time I ever had good Dim Sum was in Hawaii, which is where I am from. So finding a place here in Vegas which had decent Dim Sum was a chore in itself. \n\nMy parents and I went out to have Dim Sum since it was their anniversary, and we decided to give Orchids a shot. We were surprised, the flavor was definitely not lacking and the prices where a bit higher than other places, but not too much-quite reasonable. The selection wasn't bad either, it wasn't on the more authentic side but it was enough for everyone to enjoy and feel satisfied. \n\nWe went there on a Thursday around 3p and it was a little busy but not so busy to where you are waiting for a table, we were seated right away. I am glad that my parents were quite pleased, and I was too. We will be back!"

True to nature, he wanted Chinese food for lunch, specifically dim sum. There was a restaurant that they had eaten at four years ago and \"the people were really nice\" and \"the food really good\" but \"I can't remember the name of it\", something with the name Orchid in it.\n\nNo problem said Son #1 (that's me). I'll just punch in Orchid in Las Vegas, Nv and see what Yelp comes up with. Oh, could it be Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant? Yes? No? Maybe? Look, here are some pictures to look at. Oh? That's the one. Terrific!\n\nNaturally, when I pulled into the parking lot, the voice from the back seat goes, \"where are we? We've never been here before!\" Argggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!\n\nSo we bravely trooped into the restaurant anyway. We were greeted and seated relatively quickly. I ordered the type of tea that I like (Gook Bo, which is a blend of Gook Fah and Bo Li). It was actually pretty decent. The steam carts came around as well as women carrying small trays of food. Pretty much, a typical dim sum scene.\n\nWe don't recall seeing anything \"new\" or \"unusual\". Mostly the standard fare. We did notice that the portions were smaller than we were used to seeing. Flavors were okay but nothing really stood out. We had all the \"standards\" except we didn't order any buns.\n\nHar gow (shrimp dumpling), shui mai  (pork & shrimp dumpling), pi gwat (pork spare ribs), fung jow (chicken feet), naw mei fan (sticky rice tamale), ngow een (beef meatball), hom sui gok (deep fried meat dumpling) and many more.\n\nService was okay but I think we confused the servers as we always tend to. They look at the parents and start to speak Cantonese and then they look at me and my wife and switch to English or Chinglish depending on their proficiency.\n\nI'd say that if you're in Vegas and must have dim sum, you could do worse but don't expect the same quality that you'd find in Alhambra, Montereay Park or San Francisco."

Everything was pretty fresh and I DIDN'T get sick after eating here. Amazing! I loved their desserts. They had mango pudding and this fabulous sweet egg custard bun (not made with the typical white bun, but more like a pastry). They're Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. I thought the black bean short ribs had a strange taste to them. But overall, I had a great experience here.\n\nIt's definitely worth coming here if you want to get away from The Strip and pay REASONABLE prices for some good food. To feed NINE people it only cost about $80, including tax AND tip. AMAZING! Another time we ate there, it only cost about $50 to feed all nine of us again.

Our organizer went ahead and ordered for the two tables that we occupied. As a result, I don't know the names of the dishes we had, but it was a pretty good spread. There was fried whole fish, some sort of century egg stew, baby bok choy, fried chicken, pork in peking sauce (I think), walnut shrimp, a sampler plate containing things like jellyfish and tongue, and probably a couple more dishes. Everything was pretty good overall, but nothing was amazing. The Chinese people in our group had some gripes. For example, the baby bok choy was really regular bok choy. Also, one of the sizzling dishes originally came out on a regular plate. They then took it back and pretty much just re-served it on a sizzling plate. Finally, they didn't have the dessert that our group was hoping for. Instead, we just got a plate of oranges.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty large by Vegas standards. It seems to be in a weird and isolated location though. I'm not sure if I'd ever return, but I like the fact that they serve Dim Sum all day. That could be worth trying some day."

After waiting for about 25-30 mins, we went to go check our number on the wait and the host completely forgot to write down our number before she gave it to us so she's been skipping us the entire time when we were right in front of her waiting for our table. Good thing we went up to her to check and she sat us immediately right after. After being seated, we waited another 15 mins and I got really upset so my friend and I had to get up and tell the lady cleaning the table next to us if she can bring us some carts because we've been waiting for so long. She was very understanding and went to go get a cart and we went crazy and got at least 8-10 dishes at once hahaha. Even though the service was bad, this place still deserves a good review.

The food here is mostly seafood, so if you aren't a big fan of seafood then i would definately not recommend this place. The dim sum is probably one of the better food that they offer. And i noticed the dim sum carts were unattended most of the time i was there. The service is standard and it would be great if you speak Chinese. Otherwise, i sure hope you have your ways of getting their attention."

Do they work on commission or something?  Man.  We had 7 plates on our table within 3 minutes of sitting down because our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  \n\nThe servers annoyed my friend to no end but I actually found it pretty comical.  All the usual suspects for dim sum here and all done well.  I'll definitely be back."

Orchids boasts of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that's the source of all its problems. It's near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food is usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here is oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person. I could barely eat. \n\nThis has been the biggest disappointment yet, given my impression from Yelp. Peeps, please be more aware of what you're eating before you review."

I like new things/styles, but only if done right. This wasn't. \n\nLet's begin:\nUpon entry, the smell of incense is present to mask the smell of urine pouring out the messy bathroom. Service was friendly, but incessant, to the point of annoying. 4 times within five minutes being asked if I want a refill on my Coke. I didn't. I'm on a diet. But I said yes, like tipping the ugly girl at a strip club so she goes away!\n\nNow for the food. Where is the sauce?  The pork fried rice and chicken fried rice came out white. Looked steamed, not fried. Tasted bland as anything, flavored only by what tasted like a hint of butter. My wife's meal is traditionally served with a brown sauce (hoisin). However, there was nothing on it. Everything tasted boiled (in water) or steamed. I tried several Dim Sum dishes. The continual cart system was kinda neat, but many of the plates were indistinguishable from one another. Some were just gross, mushy, bland, \"mystery meat.\"  One or two pur\u00e9ed shrimp dim sum dishes were decent, not too fishy (shrimp toast style).\n\nThe place had no \"dumpling sauce,\" a staple in Chinese takeout where I'm from. It's essentially warm soy, ginger, and scallions, maybe some brown sugar. They did present me with vinegar instead. On my half of the continent, the Chinese vinegars are dark in color, similar to balsamic. This vinegar was pink, tasting like something you'd use to clean your shower. \n\nWontons were small with the very thin wrapper, halfheartedly twisted at the end as opposed to the kind that are closer to a thick, flavorful egg noodle, folded like a fortune cookie. They skimped on the soup contents, and I'm not sure why a wonton soup for one person is considered a half an order. What is this, Carmine's?  \n\nMenu was lacking some things we all like to see. If you google \"Chinese food menu\" you will not see anything similar to what they have here, that's a takeout style menu. However, some things I like to see in authentic cuisine were missing, as in \"braised pork shoulder.\"  \n\nEver go to a foreign country and try a McDonalds and things just aren't \"right?\"  A comparable feeling at this place. \nSome pleasantries were missing: tea automatically brought to table, crispy noodles with duck sauce,etc. However, I asked for noodles for my soup and got a crispy noodle style I had never experienced. It was really tasty. \n\nThey were friendly to my child, but I'll never visit again."

            "review": "Okay... I have only lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years now.  The only two places that I have had Dim Sum is at Cathay House (4x's) and Orchid Gardens (first time here).\n\nHonestly, Cathay House has gotten a bit downhill.  So, after this experience, I kinda prefer this place now.  By the way, when I lived in London, we used to have Dim Sum with my clients every Sunday.  After a year of this, I don't frequent Dim Sum as much...lol..\n\nAnyways, my aunt, uncle, and cousin invited me and the wife for a \"free\" lunch at Orchid Gardens.  Hey man, with a mortgage and expenses, the old saying, \"if it is free, it is for me\" truly applies.  Heck yeah, I accepted.  LOL...\n\nWe went on Sunday afternoon.  It was jammed pack.  We had to wait about 30 minutes.  When we got a table, it was difficult to maneuver through.  \n\nService -- Well, let's start with the good.  The cart comes around quite frequently.  And, the ladies are very nice.  By the way, they hardly speak a word of english.  I think they are either Vietnamese, Chinese, or a mix of other Asian ethnicity.  But, they are all sweet and polite.  As for getting water or drinks.... Good luck.  Sometimes, I often wish that I bring a big bright flashing red light to alert waiters or bus people to our station for water or any other needs.  Overall, I give this a 3.5 (due to the nice ladies)\n\nFood -- okay, for the life of me, my wife loves chicken feet.  Why oh why?  It is basically bones and skin; but, she devours them.  For someone who weighs 85 pounds, I can understand why.  Personally, I like the Shumai, the pork rib bones, anything with shrimp stuffed in it, and sticky rice.  There are others; but, I don't know how to write it in english.  Overall, the food is very fresh and it is quite good.  By the way, I wish they had more vegetable dishes... i.e. chinese broccoli or bok choy.\n\nAfter our meal, our tab for about 6 people was barely under $100.  Not bad. \n\nI would recommend this place.  Enjoy!"

Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!\n\nI've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best true dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too. \n\nIf you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!\n\nLately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!\n\nThe place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!"

These were were good, nice chewy, sweet buns and the pork was nicely seasoned\nHar Cheung Fun- fresh shrimp in large roll noodles with sweet soy. These were good, but the soy needed to be a tad more sweet and light....I think they might have not put the right sauce since that tasted more like seasoning soy.\nYeung Qi Dze-  eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste served with a black bean sauce. It was okay, I don't know if I like it like that since there isn't much taste to the eggplant aside from the sauce outside. I like cooking eggplant in sauce better- it then takes the flavor...Better yet, get a eggplant hot pot- delish! \nPai gwat- pork spareribs. One of my favorite dimsum dishes...theirs was good, soft meat with a little fat and yummy black beans. \nFried Shrimp Balls- I dunno the Chinese name of this, but it''s fried crispy outside, shrimp inside and mayo for dipping...whats not to like? \nSin Chet Kuen- bean curd rolls with pork,mushroom and bamboo shoot inside and braised in a light sauce. These are one of my favorites as a kid....haven't had in a while and it brought me back.\nDan Tat- egg custard pastry cups. Not bad, but not the best I've had. Needed more egg to pastry ratio I think, but the pastry was quite nice and flaky. \nMang gwo bu ding- pretty good mango pudding. It's a nice touch they put milk on top of it...this is how I eat it at home, but most places do not put milk on it.\n\nYes, there was only me and the BF. Today we were fatties and had a dim sum feast. I haven't done this in all the time I've lived in Vegas (3 years) so it was quite nice to do on a occasion...it was a monthly tradition growing up in LA. \n\nThe plus here is the service. Even though the carts are limited they keep them coming. Seriously, you are bombarded,in a friendly manner, with carts declaring their offerings every few minutes. If you are looking for something on the dimsum list that isn't on the carts, don't be afraid to ask as they are friendly here and will gladly get it for you if it's available. A server also comes around and checks on everyone often and was on our drink refills. This is absolutely refreshing after some rude treatment and being ignored at Changs (see my review).\n\nFunny that this place runs all day and has just about as much dimsum selection as Changs as well. Limited, but in this situation it's acceptable for an all day dimsum to have just more of the popular dishes and not the \"imperial\" selections. Just a note, but lunch/regular dim sum time is cheaper until 3 pm, and the prices for dimsum go up after that. Still, it is still reasonable prices for late night dimsum 3-10pm. I have yet to come before 3 during lunch, but I imagine there will be more selection with a busier clientele at that time. \n\nI have not tried Ping Pang Pongs...but I think this is the preferred spot for dim sum so far and might be the better of the places simply because we night folk can come have it anytime. Look, it's nothing like anything in LA, but it's good enough. If I keep comparing it then I set myself up for a bad day....it's like comparing a Honda Civic, good and reliable to a delicious, polished Audi S6. It's just on a different level."

            "review": "Wow... Reading some of the negative reviews prior to writing this is a little perplexing as I encountered no such things. My standards too low? Or yours too high? Princesses, do you get treated rudely often? Do you see the common denominator there? (Cough cough.. You.) Might I suggest you mind your own tone of voice and body language when speaking to someone. Respect goes two ways. Servers are there to serve you food, not be your personal servant. There is a difference. And if you're going to use a rude tone to someone don't be so shocked when you get it back. Try being polite and courteous. It will make a world of a difference in not just the response you get from servers, but from people in general. Not sure what to make of the \"treated like crooks\" comments. Might be from the same group.. Perhaps you ever thought to yourself that they are that vigilant because they got ripped off one too many times?? And I have taste buds. Thanks for wondering. I'm also full Chinese. So I know my dim sum. Need a blood sample? how about a geneologic family tree? (Insert eye roll here).\n\nI've been to many dim sum places in LA, SF, HI, Vancouver, and Vegas. Everywhere I travel I will find me a dim sum place to try out. On my most recent trip to Vegas I ate here twice. Found this place via Yelp. Thank you Yelp! There aren't many dim sum places in Vegas. The others I have been to are mediocre at best. Given the lack of competition Orchid Garden is the best in Vegas that I have tried. \n\nWith that said.. Neither times that I came was I presented with rude behavior. They were actually quite pleasant and helpful. The first time it was around lunch (12:00 pm) and the second late breakfast (10:00 am). Both times our food was hot, fresh, and good tasting. Lots of options for dim sum. For that matter I have never been to a place with so many selections to choose from. Hence why I had to come twice so I could try as many as my little piggy heart desired. Well seasoned. Not overcooked. I really liked the shrimp ball on sugar cane skewer. The only dish I wasn't crazy about was the daikon/radish cake. The daikon was a bit bitter, which told me it was slightly undercooked. Otherwise just about everything we tried was yummy. \n\nFrom what I could see and tell this place was clean. No pieces of food stuck onto utensils. No dirty cups.  No fingers went into my water. I inspect my plate, cups, and silverware before eating everywhere I go. Bit of a germaphobe. The place is huge and just looked a little old. I would go back my next trip out to Sin City."

They serve it all day every day, but the best time to go for the most freshly made dim sum is Saturday or Sunday at lunch time. That is when they are most busy for dim sum. So it'll be a bit of a wait, but this is when it'll taste the best. \n\nThere are many restaurants in the valley that serve dim sum, but Orchids Garden (in my opinion) offers the widest variety of tasty dim sum dishes and the most authentic dim sum eating atmosphere.\n\nNever be shy about asking the ladies pushing the food carts what they have. They may be hard to understand, but they WANT you to order stuff from them, so they will be glad to show you. Be brave and try things you normally wouldn't eat. You may be surprised by some new delicious flavors."

Being Chinese, from NJ, and having spent a good amount of time having dim sum in Chinatown, NY or in Queens, I thought it was pretty good. We had a lot of the familiar dishes -- ha gow , loh bok goh, cha siu bao, siu mai (steamed shrimp dumplings, turnip cake, steamed pork buns, pork dumplings respectively)-- as well as others that I didn't know (and unfortunately, I don't remember what they were). I thought they were decent.\n\nWe also had dau fu fa (it's basically tofu with sweet syrup) except that I never had it the way this place served it: hot and with ginger-flavored syrup. Maybe it's not even called a syrup; it's waterier than what I'm used to. It was good, but I prefer it the way I've always gotten it in Chinatown, NY -- cold and just with the plain sweet syrup. Their tofu was also already broken down.  When my parents got us this snack (from here, I believe: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fong-inn-too-new-york), it was whole, in a deli pint container because we usually got them to go. It came with a few disposable condiment containers full of syrup. We sliced up the tofu ourselves and enjoyed it cold.\n\nOne thing I thought was weird was that they didn't have any oyster sauce  (ho yau). What Chinese establishment doesn't carry oyster sauce?! When you order loh bok goh in NY, you get oyster sauce with it. They said they didn't have any, but they offered to give me hoisin instead. I said okay, I'll try it. I was reluctant to eat it that way, but I dabbed a bit on the first piece, tasted it, and found that my expectations for this new combination were correct -- it was gross. I finished off that piece and ate the other two plain. Maybe next time I go, I should bring my own little container of oyster sauce so I can enjoy the loh bok goh way I always have.\n\nOther than that, a good experience. I may try Ping Pang Pong someday. Like someone mentioned in a review for there, the name didn't seem to indicate authentic dim sum was served, but that reviewer said s/he was proven wrong.\n\n..Bah, so mind boggling how a dim sum restaurant doesn't have ho yau. It's sacrilegious.\n\nMan, I really miss being at home."

Also, the preparations are akin to old school diner classics. It is not \"elevated\". But it is oh-so-comforting. I really enjoyed it - it reminded me of dim sum with my grandparents.\n\nPrices are on-point for this type of establishment - compared to Seattle, Vancouver BC and San Francisco.

Ordered all the basic stuff, none blew my mind away. If this is all that Vegas has to offer, I'm a little sad. Next time that I'm back in SinCity, I'll hit up some other spots."

A bit off the strip but great for large parties and spacious tables especially for children.  \n\nI really come here for their variety of dim sum. \nSeveral ladies push around carts of steaming dumplings to small plates of vegetables and shumai to name a few. My favorites are the har gow, steamed greens and shrimp pops. There is also desserts available distinguished with sweet glazes and sweet sticky rice cakes. \n\nMy preferences are very simple...house pan fried noodles loaded with bok choy, mushrooms, greens and chicken, salty pork chops that compliment either steamed white rice or combination fried rice and pretty much any steamed vegetable.  So yummy you won't even feel like you over did it as expected when eating Chinese food.  The complementary oolong tea is a nice drink during the meal as well as a great finisher. \n\nAlso, their Thai iced tea is large, tall and flavorful not watered down with too much ice. It goes great with just about everything they serve. \n\nOne thing is for sure, the prices are reasonable and it's big enough to accomadate a large head count.\n\nHuge parking lot at the front and can get really crowded on the weekends during brunch.  Plan to arrive early to beat the wait list."

However, once we were seated, things started to roll rather quickly. They asked what kind of tea we wanted and it was brought out really fast. The carts started to roll our way and it had most of the stuff we were wanting to eat so that was a plus.\n\nThe har gaw was slightly above average (compared to the rest of Vegas) and the soy sheet rolls weren't bad at all. My fave was the fact that they had 'ma lai go' and it was the authentic kind -- tan brown in color rather than sponge cake yellow.\n\nLike what the other reviewers have mentioned it's dirty and the bathrooms are filthy. However, pee before you leave your hotel and go early so you don't have a wait -- avoid having to go to the bathroom at all and you'll have a good meal. Very cheap dim sum I'd say!"

Perhaps that's simply because my minimal Cantonese ONLY extends to ordering food. We often will just order take-out dim sum when we come here and usually that works out just as well.

The last time I had peking duck was in Hong Kong, where the sizzling duck was carved at table side and the skin was perfectly crispy.  It was like candy.  Unfortunately, my experience at Orchids Garden was not on par.  Parts of the skin were still attached to the duck meat and only half of the pieces were crispy, while the others were limp and chewy.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy, although a little thicker than I prefer.  But, the addition of the plum sauce and the spring onions made me forget the disappointing duck skin. \n\nI probably won't order it again, hence the search for delicious Peking Duck in Las Vegas continues.

The egg custards were so good we ordered a second round of them instead of trying something else, they're pretty much flan in a pie shell.\n\nEverything is pretty reasonably priced - a huge dinner for 3 only ran us 50$ with drinks - and the menu on their site does have correct prices even though the first page says it's out of date. The few things we wanted that weren't visible on the carts when they came by (roast duck and mango pudding), all we had to do was ask the cart pusher lady  and she came back swiftly with them. \n\nCaveat: There is definitely a slight language barrier and a big cultural barrier here. The lower reviews that I saw claim the service is bad, the staff is unfriendly, etc but those people are too ethnocentric to even fathom that service has different meanings in different cultures. Yes, by American sugar-sweet service standards they are brusque and short and strictly businesslike but this place is MUCH more friendly and 'Americanized' service-wise than most more-authentic Chinese places I've been to. Anyone who feels they were treated rudely probably just can't fathom that anything that isn't bowing at their feet is directly attacking them. \n\nDisclaimer: this is the first and only dim sum restaurant I've been to.

It was a typical Chinese restaurant but definitely a couple steps higher than the Chinese buffet. I had the chicken chow mein which was rather salty but pretty good. My mother had the moo goo gai pan which was decent. \nThe service definitely was bad to say the least. I understand that we're right at the edge of Chinatown, however there was an entire staff that had a giant language barrier with me and my mother. After being in business all these years in America, you would think that the English would be getting a little bit better and better. Not so much. We sat down to eat ordered our food and then they brought it out in a to go box. Maybe they were trying to gives a hint to leave? Maybe because I had my 18-month-old son with me and they were dreading having to clean up after him? Honestly whatever the reason was they didn't get that we were there to dying in considering they set us we placed our order. They then brought our food which was lukewarm out to us to our plates to service and never refilled our water. When we get ready to pay we waited in line go to the cashier and realize that they just recently got a B rating from the health District. I wasn't that much of a happy camper.\n\nThere are many other amazing Chinese restaurants as well as Chinese fusion restaurants and Thai restaurants in town but I feel more comfortable eating at.

No wait time made them an instant favorite in my book.\n\nThe carts actually come by frequently. The baked char siu bao came out so fresh and hot, it was like heaven in my mouth. They have all the staples from dumplings to noodles to bao to dan tat (2 kinds). I usually hate custards but I really enjoyed the fruit-topped one. I didn't feel yelled at, ignored, or left hungry, and I appreciated all of it.\n\nBottom line? 20 plates for 3 people for $50 bucks. Can't beat that."

Some waiters/waitresses will try to stamp it twice and charge you double!

What kind of dim sum place doesnt have Siu Mai ?! Just for that I wish I could give it ZERO stars. But there were other factors that contributed to this low grade.\n\nNone of the food looked or tasted fresh. AT ALL. The carts weren't even steamers so most of the food was COLD. The only plus about this place was that they were able to accommodate 16 of us in almost no time at all. Other than that, I would recommend driving a little farther for good dimsum in the Asian plaza. Peace."

Sometimes the carts take forever to make it back to you but some carts seem to stop by every 5 minutes. It's always the ones we want that never seem to come around.\n\nThe service is pretty good though, and the hosts and cart ladies are always attentive and err on the friendly side, despite the fact that I am Chinese and cannot speak it (which is apparently a sin). Prices are also attractive, especially for a light lunch or for those who don't prefer to stuff themselves senseless.\n\nAny dishes with noodles (such as the big fat ones with shrimp inside) are okay - not the softest but still satisfies my craving. Harkow and shumai is decent as well. I always like getting beef tendon, egg tarts, and this crispy fluffy taro bun.\n\nI've never had to wait but the majority of tables in the wide-open eating space is occupied. Of course, my favorite aspect of Orchids is the consistency. Every time I've been there, I know what to expect and it's great for when I crave dim sum that won't hurt my wallet.

This place is located on the opposite end of Chinatown so it's a little quiet. I walked in around 4.00p and it was kinda dead. The dim sum carts were rolling just like if it was regular busy hours. You can either order straight from the menu or from the carts. The flavor was good but what bugged me was that some of be dim sum items were lukewarm. But, I guess it's hard to keep it fresh and warm it's offered all day and it's not busy. However, the fresh items were really good. The portions are also a little smaller which I like cuz usually after binging on dim sum I feel bloated. Plus, I feel less guilty.

Dim sum can be bad if it's not fresh. But it is good here. A warning - you should get there before 1:30 or the number of dim sum carts hawked by their cart ladies declines after the peak of lunch.  They do advertise \"dim sum all day\".  So, you can order it on the phone or in person, and all of your stuff will come out freshly steamed or baked.  They do not take dim sum from the cart ladies for to go orders. \n\nThis is a free standing building off Sahara west of Eyeglass World. The decor and ambiance isn't something you'd wow about.  The bathrooms aren't the cleanest, and the parking during peak times (noon - 1 PM) can be a challenge.  But overall, it was a nice place to be when you want some dim sum as well as traditional Chinese food.  A lot of first time customers get a puzzled look when they cart ladies come by, but often by the end of their meal, they're hooked.  \n\nI don't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things our group loved.  We tried/shared all the different types of siu mai, egg rolls, har gow and  pork bun (steamed, baked).  Loved that gai lan, and enjoyed the porridge. We had their fried fish, noodles, and some desserts like custard pie, sweet rice cakes, sesame balls, and I forget the rest. We went  a1:15 PM so the stuff was pretty fresh and the little carts were still darting through the restaurant. Some of the ladies were hard to understand but it didn't matter as long as you could see what she had in her cart. We took what we didn't finish home.  But except for the desserts, they tasted much better in the restaurant.  Lucky for me being a sweet tooth, they made for a great after dinner snack.  Yummy\n\nIt's a hassle from where in OC I live to get to the decent dim sum places in LA county.  How I miss living in the SF Bay area where dim sum places in Oakland and SF Chinatown are plentiful and yummy.  But when visiting my relatives in Vegas, this is an excellent choice. Each plate of dim sum was about $2 each, plus or minus some change."

As soon as you sit down, there is a cart or two on its' way to start filling you up.  \n\nThe carts come around frequently and are always being replenished with the goodies they serve. It doesn't take long for you to find your favorite dish on a dim sum cart.  \n\nEverything tasted very very fresh and we all enjoyed our meal.  You can tell all of the dishes are made with quality ingredients. \n\nThe restaurant is huge but they have the staff to give everyone great service.  They also have space for large parties or groups.  \n\nCentrally located, you can access Orchids Garden via cab from the Las Vegas strip or if you happen to live in town it's right on Sahara , west of the strip."

While it was crowded around noon, was seated in under 10 minutes for a party of 4 once and seated immediately for a party of 2.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with how dim sum works, there are carts that bring food around, you point to what you want and the server stamps a card on your table.  When you are done they add-up all the stamps.  \n\nThis place has fresh items and good amount of variety."

We waited about an hour the first time and about 35 minutes the second time.  \n\nOverall, I thought the dim sum was just ok.  I've had much better in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Actually, I think that the dim sum at Chang's (Vegas) is better too.  \n\nPrice is about the same as Chang's.  Portions seemed to be slightly smaller.  However, the service at Orchids is much better than Chang's.  When you ask for something at Orchids, it comes right away.  Whereas, we have waited 15 minutes for our check at Chang's.  I just wish the dim sum was better at Orchids in both the size and taste.\n\nXie Xie!"

If you don't see it in the cart you can try to get it from waiters but make sure you know the name of that dim sum.  It takes awhile for them to get to you and they are running around like crazy. But other than that it's the usual dim sum way. Wait wait wait and bam 5 carts right there.  And you're trying to scramble and order it all. We pretty much ordered the simple dumplings, noodles, the ones with shrimp in it (lol) and we also got tea which is complementary. \n\nThis location is in a plaza so parking is good.

It was challenging understanding the woman offering us the menu choices.  There is a menu that has pictures, but a lot of the menu items looked the same.  \nOverall, the food was absolutely NASTY.  It was old and greasy.  The calamari was cold, so we sent it back.  All they did was throw it back in the fryer.  So now it was hot but overcooked.

Better than other places in Vegas, but still just okay.\n\nHowever, the one star isn't plainly because of the taste of the food. It is due to what happened after eating there...\n\nI got FOOD POISONING. My stomach began feeling upset after having dinner there. The next day, I couldn't keep anything down. I'm guessing it was the chicken feet, since it's the only thing I ate that my family didn't (I'm fairly adventurous with my food and have had chicken feet many times at many different places, so this is more than just something \"not agreeing\" with my stomach). \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going back."

The food was good but it being dim sum, sometimes it freshly made and some if it was probably a few hours old and cold by the time it got to us. Went there early afternoon on a Saturday I think and it was fairly empty and they didn't have as many runners and food going around so it took a while for us to get a decent amount of food on our table. I don't know when their prime hours are but it's probably better if you go sometime around there where they're expecting to have a lot of people, thus more food being prepared and it being more fresh. I'd definitely go there again.\n\nHad two tvs but what they were airing was completely random. The big screen had a soccer game going on and there's another screen up front by the waiting area and that was airing Entertainment Tonight or something."

Two of us staggered out for $18, including tax and a generous tip.\nThe minuses:  It's way too far away from my apartment near UNLV.  As in too many transfers, too long a bus ride.  The Dim Sum was okay.  We had a variety of dishes, but nothing was superb.\nThe neither-good-nor-bad:  Orchids Garden also has American-style Chinese food (Chow mein, sweet and sour something...).  I saw an Anglo couple (I'm Anglo, too) with those kinds of dishes on their table.  There were also plenty of Asians eating Dim Sum or real Chinese food.  If I were going out for Chinese food with a very mixed group (which would be my classmates, or my former colleagues), this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking."

Because of their all day dim sum dining, the place is steadily busy!\n\nWe finally decided to try Orchids Garden because we kept hearing about it.  There are a ton of places on Spring Mountain that cater to the dim sum crowd but Orchids Garden off of Sahara kept coming up.  Off to dim sum we go!\n\nThe lady and I went on a Saturday for lunch time and it was no joke, the restaurant was full!  There were people shouting and whistling as carts full of wonderful dim sum were whizzing around the dining area.  There was steam and foul-sounding \nChinese language everywhere!  Definitely nice to see the hustle and bustle.  Gotta get your dim sum order in before the cart runs out and you have to wait!\n\nAfter being seated we were given a regular restaurant menu and the dim sum menu.  It was a nice touch, prices were given in categories, and pictures were used for the various dim sum to make it easier for patrons who are not familiar with the art of dumplings.  I've watched dim sum making before, and damn, it truly is an art because you gotta be patient and be able to put out quality dim sum in almost no time flat.  Oh my aching hands!\n\nOrchids Garden dim sum is fairly priced.  Still a bit more than dim sum from places like Cali, but not bad for Vegas standards.  All dim sum dishes range from around $2 - $6 area, and there is something for just about everyone.  Me?  I love sticking to the cheap, cheap, cheap end of the dim sum spectrum.  I think all dim sum should be cheap!  It's supposed to be akin to street food!  Who the heck wants to pay $6 for friggin' Chinese broccoli?  I don't.  Some of our faves:\n\n-Steamed chicken feet (love it)\n-Steamed BBQ pork bun\n-Pan fried daikon cake\n-Baked BBQ pork bun (yummy)\n-Shrimp har gow\n-Pan fried chives dumpling (chive-y)\n-Beef in rice noodle\n-Mushroom shiu mai\n\nThe chicken feet here are fantastic!  Sticky, fatty, and delicious with a bowl of hot white rice.  We employ multiple orders of this whenever we go.  I am also a big fan of the chives dumpling since I am an onion lover.  Each of the dim sum above is in the $2 - $4 range for each serving.  Not too cheap but not so expensive it breaks the bank.  I've had better dim sum in other places but I think for Las Vegas it is pretty good.  Not to mention, dim sum all day?  It appeals to a lot of (drunk @$$)people here.  \n\nI've seen the restaurant menu but have yet to try anything off of it.  But it does have a massive amount of choices which is good.  But for now, dim sum me up...baby!\n\nVerdict?  Orchids Garden is a good spot for some decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim sum comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK, although some folks say the service can be a bit rude.  But then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  So the next time you have a dim sum craving and can't decide where to go, give Orchids Garden a try.  Just remember, it's off of Sahara and not Spring Mountain!"

Spot on.  It was a treat.  Had both Dim Sum........at night.  Which is unusual.  Usually they only serve this early in the day.  And you could order off the menu for other chinese food.\n\nKey point..........LOTS of Asians here.  That means USUALLY a good place to eat.  My buddy and I ate Roast Duck, shrimp, House Special LoMein.  Service was good; though not prompt.  I would highly recommend this place.....and did so to others that worked at the casino we were staying at."

We had just experienced a dim sum restaurant in San Francisco that only served dim sum for lunch and we were expecting to have it for dinner. We were all first timers to Orchids Garden and have all decided... yes, we will be returning!\n\nWe came on weekday evening around 6:30. There was no wait and were seated immediately. The dining area was huge... we couldn't even imagine what it's like on a busy night. Aside from our table, there were maybe 3 other tables that were occupied. Once 7:00 rolled around, people started coming in.  We came at a really good time.\n\nWe devoured 21 dishes between the 4 of us. I don't know if that's average or excessive, but we were pretty hungry.  :P The food was a little on the salty side (for me, but no one else... some, not all) and the women behind the carts were a little pushy (which we expected from reading all the reviews), but still friendly."

It's upsetting since this is my absolute favorite dim sum dish. The noodle rolls were too dense. Also, sweet soy sauce was lacking flavor, it tasted watered down. \n\nThe bbq pork buns had a tiny bit of bbq pork filling, it was mostly bread.\n\nThe fried taro cake was greasier than it should have been."

It's a dim sum place that serves everything like you would find on the streets of Hong Kong.  These carts come around with steamed dim sum and you choose what you want, as much of it as you want.  They also have a regular menu for those who shy away from cart food or dim sum altogether.  I tried their menu and it's decent but isn't the best I've had.  Overall, great place for some good eats when you're on a time crunch and want some dumplings.  I like it, and it's very popular, but unfortunately I cannot say that I'm a fan nor is it as good as it gets.  \n\nTo be honest, I like the shumai at Noodle No. 9 in Caesar's Palace, but for any other type of dim sum this restaurant has it.  You want dim sum?  Try here.  It's fun dining!"

Plates were strewn about, chopsticks flew. Servers constantly came by to clear our dishes and to ask if we wanted more food which was always appreciated.

The pork and shrimp based pieces were fresh and tasty, with a couple of complaints;  1) the rice wrappings on the har gow and rice noodle rolls had too much flour-y taste to them, and 2) the rice noodle rolls had too much of the rice noodles for the amount of shrimp.  Not sure there should be flour taste in rice noodles...  But otherwise, the shu mais and dumplings were great, and the pimento stuffed with shrimp dim sum was fantastic.  And the sweet cream buns were yummy too.  \n\nClean setting, fresh and mostly delish dim sums, and timeliness all add up to a satisfying experience.

And instead of shark fin, they had glass noodles instead!\n\nTheir standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings were decent.  Their chicken feet in black bean sauce was flavorful.  Their bean curd wrapped seafood thing was okay, some of it over steamed though.  The Chinese broccoli was slippery as heck and the shrimp rice noodle was decent too.\n\nThe tricky thing was that as we hung out after we paid our bill, we noticed different stuff coming out!  I saw the Pineapple Bun and inquired if there was yellow egg custard in it, and the lady confirmed there was!  Since discovering this yummy bun only recently, I had to get some.  And it was oh so good, and piping hot too!  (It's the marriage of the Bolo Bao and the Nai Wong Bao!)  \n\nI only had the small egg custard tarts and this other fruit tart that I wouldn't usually see in a dim sum restaurant for dessert.  They did have the soft tofu, but the lady scooping it caught too much water in there, drowning out the syrupy taste.\n\nOverall, Orchids Garden was a decent place for dim sum on a Saturday morning.  It's a huge place with lots of Chinese (ethnic Chinese, as I could hear Cantonese being spoken everywhere) and non-Chinese customers dining here.  I like that you can see non-Chinese families dining here as it can often be intimidating at these huge dim sum operations.  \n\nAnd the prices were pretty decent too. With a party of four, it came out to about $65 total, and we definitely stuffed ourselves pretty good too.\n\nUntil I find another place better, you'll find me here again.  The wait was minimal too. And there's parking in the back as well!\n\nUpdate: 01/03/07 - I've been back twice already since this review!  And it's not because the food is so fabulous, but I have yet to find a better one.  You can easily fit 14 people at a table with minimal wait too!  And their Pineapple Egg Custard buns are so worthy waiting for!  Get them while they are hot and take them all if you can!  They are THAT good.\n\nUpdate: 11/05/07 - Went back yesterday for dim sum.  Their chicken's feet was pretty good, and the deep fried calamari was a surprise hit too.  The BF really like the roasted pork that came with pickled veggies.  Their chive and shrimp dumpling is good when it's hot, and thank goodness the Shanghai dumplings never came out since I forgot our bad experience with it the first time!  The pineapple egg custard bun was present, but not quite as good when it's not piping hot.  So, only get it when it's hot hot hot!"

The service is snappy and the food is hot and fresh.

It is very loud and the waitress threw the forks down to reach everyone instead of walking around the table. I thought that was kind of rude. I had my 10 month old with me ( asleep in an infant car seat) and the table we were being seated at was in the middle, next to other large parties who were VERY loud. I asked if we could sit in the corner table instead and the hostess was kind of annoyed about this, but agreed to it. In my opinion the best thing here is the small fried noodles and the fact that they carry Coke products. I suppose the part where you're seated and immediately start eating is nice too. Sometimes the language barrier can cause misunderstandings too. Today we placed an order of fried rice and it never arrived. They did verify this and removed it from the bill though. All in all I guess they're trying, but for me it was an Ok experience. Nothing crazy for me to want to tell the Yelp community to go ahead and \"try it!\"."

A local realtor recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  In fact, our entire meal was absolutely delicious!  Two Chinese members of our party did the ordering so the variety was excellent, we had dishes that I have never ordered/tasted before.  And while I confess my tastes may be a bit pedestrian, I especially enjoyed the fried shrimp with shell (which I order often), it was delicately crispy and not too salty.  My other favorites were shrimp in rice noodle rolls, spinach dumpling, sticky rice in lotus leaf, shrimp balls, siu mai, bbq pork buns, chinese broccoli, sweet tofu and fried sesame balls.  I was even impressed with the baked egg tart.  It's pastry was crumbly and the egg custard tasted home made.  I left absolutely stuffed, everything was so good that I ate more than was sensible!

You just point to the ones you want and they drop it off on your table and stamp your table card to keep track how many dishes to charge you for.

Usually Easter is dominated by hotels, casinos offering the standard higher priced brunch  However, we decided on Dim Sum (not a tradition) but I was willing to try it because it will please my mother and I am the one visiting Vegas.  \n\nThe place itself is in northwest of the strip on Sahara and was not really far from where my mom and Manny lived (if there was no traffic) we got there in plenty of time to get a number and wait.  The proportion of Chinese speaking patrons were probably  90 to 1 to non Chinese.  The newspapers outside the lobby was chinese, all the writing on the menu board is chinese..  The good thing about dim sum is point and taste.  If you picked something you didn't like then you are fine to eat something else.\n\nSo steamed or fried.  Most of the items we did get were steamed (not as in angry) but were in a metal or wood container, it's like lunch a la carte but they move the food around and ask you if you want something (sometimes the same thing several times).  Of course if you like it, then you can get more of the same.  \n\nWe picked a range of food from simple short ribs, pork roast, pork and shrimp dumplings.  But Manny my cousin was apt for the challenge, he said I like chicken feet so we ordered it.  In all my experiences in eating Chinese or Asian food, chicken feet has never touched this lips.  However convinced by my cousin to try this slightly battered (coating not beat up) chicken feet.  I tried it, it was not as bad as I thought.  It was gelatinous and easy to eat and spit.  Now I can say I ate chicken feet but would I try it again, maybe next time when its deep fried and I have had several beers.\n\nOverally service was hectic but good.  The only caveat is the long wait for the check to be completed.  We thought they would rush us out but because the restaurant had slowed down since we came in, the new customers were getting the attention, we were just waiting.  Always drink tea when you are eating dim sum, it helps with the greasy food you are ingesting.  Oh, we did eat chinese broccoli, the designated vegetable.  We also had some smelt, my mom' s favorite (not crunchy or seasoned enough for me)\n\nThe ultimate surprise which I always try to look for dim sum is the tofu.  This is not the tofu you buy in the supermarket, this is one is silky and warm and with a little syrup and was delicious - taho in the Philippines.\n\nOverall, for the clientele who believe this is good enough for them and good enough for us.  It cost us about 60 bucks which is 20 per person (no I didn't make my Mom pay - Manny and I split it)..  I had a good and new experience in Las Vegas away from the strip and the namebrand chef cuisine."

Was not to sure what this whole dim sum thing was about only that it was small portions that came to you on carts and you just picked what you wanted. Went with 2 girlfriends from school and we were hungry. We ended up getting 9 plates to share. It did not seem like a lot of food because everything came in 3s. Three small potstickers, three small pork balls, three small this, and that. Well we were so wrong.    After eating all the different things we had to be rolled out of there. \n\nPlace was good, only problem is you don't know how much things cost when they are wheeling them around. They ask if you want it, you say yes, they give it to you then they take a stamp and place it on A,B,C etc.  at the end they take your ticket and bring you back your bill with the price. Everything in Chinese except the dollar amount. \n\nI would go back and give it another try. Like I said food was good. It was kept hog and fresh."

A friend invited several of us to celebrate her successful completion of her doctoral degree and to enjoy some dishes.  We chose a variety of dishes, including the chicken feet, the Chinese broccoli, the pork dumplings, turnip cakes, and Peking duck. \n\nPros: plenty of parking, clean and updated bathroom (the sinks were those fancy glass basins that sit on top of the counter), and clean floor (yes, worth mentioning IMO!).  Service was pretty good, perhaps due to my friend being Taiwanese and speaking Cantonese!  The cart ladies came around often and prices seem reasonable, but I wouldn't know for certain because my friend treated us to dinner.  (Nice or what?)  \n\nCons: personally, I liked the broccoli, pork dumplings, and turnip cakes the best.  I found the chicken feet greasy and lacking in texture; the skin tasted cold and sort of like congealed fat.  Same with the duck; while I enjoyed the flavor of the actual duck meat with the accompanying sauce, I thought the skin was more limp than crisp, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.\n\nNothing was horrible, but nothing stood out as stellar.  It was a fun evening with some friends and I'm glad to have sampled some dim sum again, but I think I'll check out another Asian eatery next time."

Service ranges from bad to mediocre. One time, a lady was heading toward our table with the cart... but saw a bigger party seated two tables after us, told us to wait and skipped us to go to them, and then came back once she was finished at their table. It's also pretty hard to get them to refill whatever it is you're drinking.\n\nThey also don't clean underneath the tables once people are done eating. So if eating at a booth, be sure to NOT look under the table if you don't want to be disgusted. \n\nPrices are what you would find at any other dim sum restaurant."

We got our usual dim sum staples of pork siu mai, shrimp balls, and miscellaneous dumplings. We also ordered Sesame Chicken and Hong Kong-style Noodles with Seafood.\n\nThe dim sum was pretty good considering it was in the evening. The sui mai was soft and pretty juicy. The shrimp balls were big and tasted great with the sweet mayo.  And I cannot recommend soy sauce mixed with some chili oil enough!\n\nThe sesame chicken wasn't anything special. Good but nothing noteworthy. The Hong Kong-style noodles were great, though. More noodles and the sauce wasn't bland like at other places.\n\nThe servers were also decently friendly, got us water, and speak English. Additionally, none of them mistook me for being Chinese! It was probably because my parents were with me and they look more non-Chinese than I.\n\nThis is the first time we ate here. Thanks to my friends for recommending this place.

Definitely subpar vs. dim sum houses in the SF Bay Area!!!  \n\nCarts came around regularly, but didn't have much variety.\nHar gow was tasty (and the shrimp seemed fresh), but very small. \nBaked shar siu bao was very good, excellent bbq pork, sweet bun.\nSteamed shar siu bao was good, but small.\nWe kept asking for the xiao lum bao Shanghai dumplings, and the cart ladies said \"it's coming!\"  Finally we asked a waiter, and she said you had to order it--and it'd take 15 min.  Meh!  Had they admitted this the first time we asked, we could have ordered it and enjoyed it!\nCrab claw balls were huge--the shrimp ball part was delicious, but the actual crab claw was tiny and crab meat wasn't good (tasted previously frozen)\nDeep fried shrimp dumplings were excellent, tasty/fresh/crisp.\nGai lan was tender and delicious, but VERY small (both in terms of the size of the vegetable stalks and in quantity on the plate compared to any Bay Area dim sum house)\nMango pudding was regular."

Which is fine, since I'm used to it by now, but my last experience here made me never want to come back.\n\nI decided to come here one day craving Dim Sum. It was the closest location to my school so I decided to pay Orchid Garden a visit. I went in, glad to see there was no line, made I contact with at least 3 different people and had to wait 10 minutes before I was seated. I understand if it is not your job as a cart pusher to seat customers, but I'm sure you have the ability to sit me down at a table or at least notify the host to seat me.\n\nOnce I was seated, I wanted ordered my usual Har Gow, Siu Mai, Chow Fun, and Shrimp balls; however, after being served cold shrimp balls and Siu Mai, I couldn't eat any more of the food they were serving. The 5 waitresses running around the restaurant didn't ever have time to check and ask if \"everything is okay\" or if there's \"anything I need..\" So I helped myself and my girlfriend to the counter, asked for the check, left no tip and walked out.\n\nI highly recommend eating at Cathay or Chang's for Dim Sum.

I don't know if its fair to compare this place to any Dim Sum spots that I've been to in a Chinatown in SF or LA. But I've tasted better, and I will. Honestly, the Dim Sum wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I walked in and it definitely looked and smelled like the usual Chinese restaurant but the food definitely didn't taste like one. The breaded shrimp balls were of usual size but it came with only two pieces. I don't think I've ever been to a Dim Sum spot where they only serve you two pieces of anything, its usually 4. This has to be bad Feng Shui. Like I brought up earlier, they were also serving the smallest shumai that I've EVER seen. The pork buns were delicious due to the fluffy white bread with glaze on top, but there was hardly any pork, they should just call it BUN! I know we are in a recession, but geez, don't make it so obvious! \n\nIts a bit far from the strip and the prices are decent. With the size of their dishes it better be affordable. This is the only Dim Sum place that I've tried in LV and I know all the other ones are a bit more pricey, so this may be a good spot for locals but not if you've been to any Chinatown before. I would only comeback if friends decide to comeback, otherwise I would pass.\n\nThe only positive is that we were able to sit 24 people instantly. Which is A-OK in my book!"

I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.\n\nCame in for an early dinner at about 6PM.\nLove how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.\n\nWe got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).\n\nMade the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were \"coming right out\" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.\n\nWe spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings."

I can't spell the traditional names so I'm going to review in an american fashion.\n\nSHRIMP anything is delicious . The shrimp with sugar cane is good. The shrimp with fried crispie stuff is good.  The steamed shrimp and pork shumai is good. I mean, it's dim sum! Mostly Everything is good! I even like the chicken feet and the tripe! \n\nI guess what i can review best about is quality. Out of a few dim sum spots around town this place is my favorite. The food never disappoints!\n\nService is somewhat lacking as my water was empty a few times before i had to flag down a waiter to refill me. \n\nOverall, if you want dim sum, ORCHID Gardens is the bee's knee's or the cat's pajama's..whatever you prefer."

Having just moved to vegas, I'm hesitant to try Asian restaurants unless I hear good things about them from people (or yelp!) because, well, you can get sick if they don't run a clean ship in the back kitchen. Luckily, this place is very clean. \n\nBasically your typical dim sum place, which for all of you who don't know is kinda like tapas (small plates) of Chinese food. Servers come past the tables pushing carts full of food that you can choose from. They bill you at the end of the meal according to a little order card on your table, which they stamp/write on when you get each plate. \n\nWe had the chow mein (fried noodles), the choy sum (Chinese broccoli), shumai (pork meatballs in egg wrapper), shrimp balls, shrimp potstickers, char siu bao (steamed pork bun), chive dumplings, and the crab balls. Make sure you get those crab balls. They have a crab claw sticking out of them to identify them and they look weird, but they are sooooooo juicy and delicious. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that they had fried taro \"footballs.\" I'm from Hawaii and taro isn't something I'd expected to see in a vegas restaurant, so yay! (Taro is a starchy root vegetable similar to a potato. A staple in traditional Hawaiian cuisine. Not sure what they call it in Chinese.) \n\nWhen in doubt, just point to what you want on the cart. Prices are reasonable ($50 for three hungry people, including drinks) so definitely venture out and try things!"

It's a pretty big restaurant and I think the quality of their dim sum slightly less than other places but that wouldn't deter me from coming here again. I'm guessing because they offer dim sum all day, quality might not be as good as places that offer it at a limited time. \n\nI usually don't experience a wait here and the carts come by my table pretty often which I like. The only time I waited, which wasn't too long, was when my fiance and I treated our mothers to a mother's day bunch. Not too shabby!  \n\nThe biggest plus is that Orchids offers more variety selection of desserts than other dim sum places. (ie not just mango pudding and egg tarts but fruit tart, tofu, mango pudding and some sort of fruit cup)"

            "review": "TL;DR - Below average dimsum + Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Frozen, not fresh. Decent place to fill your dimsum craving, but you'll find better places around for a similar value.\n\nSo subpar. Dimsum of this quality would never fly in the Bay Area.\n\nToday was surprisingly busy, but the wait wasn't long. 20 minutes for a table of 5 to be seated.\n\nWe ordered the basic dimsum - xiu mai, hargao, and shrimp noodle rolls. The xiu mai was a bit smaller than I was used to back in the Bay, but that didn't bother me much. Flavor was there; not impressive, but also didn't disappoint. But it didn't taste fresh...it looked frozen.\n\nHargao was also a little bit smaller than what I was used to. Flavor was actually subpar, as I tasted nothing. Also looked frozen, not fresh.\n\nShrimp noodle rolls were a huge disappointment. No flavor in the rolls, despite it being soaked in the soy sauce. Why is that? It's because the SHRIMP was so damn small! This is a sure sign that food in the kitchen is frozen, not fresh.\n\nWe also ordered other dimsum dishes, such as shrimp with eggplant, chicken feet, fried crab balls, fried meat balls, and steamed buns. In addition, hot and sour soup and honey walnut shrimp was ordered.\n\nThe shrimp with eggplant was actually decent. There was some flavor in the shrimp, but the eggplant elevated the dish just a little more.\n\nChicken feet was also decent. The sauce it was tossed / coated in was flavorful, but chicken was average; a bit dry and looked overcooked.\n\nFried crab balls had a lot of flavor in them, and the crab claw embedded in the ball elevated the presentation.\n\nFried meat balls were average - 95% batter and 5% actual meat filling. I wouldn't suggest getting this st any dimsum place ANYWHERE, as it is just too greasy and lacks a bunch of flavor.\n\nThe steamed bun I ordered was actually a Chinese sausage bun. Some flavor was present, but the sausage itself was so dry that it shouldn't be considered a sausage anymore. It's jerky.\n\nThe hot and sour soup was your standard hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant. Packed spice for sure, but flavor itself was average.\n\nThe honey walnut shrimp came to me as a pleasant surprise to me. Each puny shrimp was battered, deep-fried, then tossed in a bath of mayo. This is VERY different from honey walnut shrimp I'm used to in the Bay (large shrimp tossed in a lighter bath of mayo, and thank god it's not battered and deep-fried). Flavor was very much absent due to the batter, but mayo made up for some of what was missing. Walnuts were average, with a standard crunch.\n\nChinese broccoli with XO sauce was subpar. Completely soaked in sesame oil, which meant I missed out on the freshness of the vegetables. I didn't have any sauce, so I can't speak much on that. \n\nService, for a lack of a better word, was slow and from what I observed, actually crappy. Rude hostess at the front killed the vibe I had for this restaurant. $110 for 5 people, from what we ordered, so it's not AS economically-friendly, but it's a better value than the places on the Strip."

I spoke to a young Asian couple there and asked if there were any good dim sum places in the area. They said Chang's was as good as it gets in Vegas. They did mention Orchids Garden as a close alternative. So lunch time hits and here I am. The staff was friendly I was seated right away and the carts immediately came to my table. I tried the same dishes as Chang's which were shiu mai, har gow and rice noodle rolls with shrimp. I also tried the fried shrimp ball with fried sugar cane sticks  which I did not see on Chang's menu. The shiu mai was fresh and delicious, very comparable to places back home as was the har gow. The rice noodle rolls were equally tasty and slightly better than back home. We have a different version of the sugar cane shrimp roll back home that has a crab leg in place of the fried sugar cane stick. The shrimp used in this item had a great flavor and the texture to the shrimp ball was perfect. 5 stars and this is definitely going to be my regular dim sum spot!!!"

High recommendations for this place maybe because they serve dim sum all day rather than just for brunch/lunch like other places?\n\nWe always get the pan fried combination noodles when coming to a dim sum place, bao (pork bun) and siomai (dumpling). Today my sister ordered the crab ball which is basically crab meat balled and fried. It was pretty good actually, and they ask if you want the mayo dipping sauce to go along with it. My advice, ask for a couple spoon scoop fills if you like mayo or creamy dipping sauces so you'll have enough for 3 of the shrimp balls. Really does do the shrimp and crab balls justice. This place wasn't outstanding, and it wasn't bad either. I guess it's what you expect at a dim sum place. I know I'll be back here if I'm in town with family again."

We constantly come back simply because of our love for dim sum and only that. Since the first day we ate here, service has always been unreliable. Perhaps 1 out of every 5 visits here, we receive somewhat mediocre service. Every other time, we are faced with rude and dismissive servers, eager to just move through every table and complete their rotation. One server, who clearly had plenty more shumai in her cart, was extremely hesitant to give us more than one order. Shu mai is our family's favorite and we typically order at least 3 bowls. It seems as if every employee there would rather be somewhere else. Even the lady, who seems to be the manager, was on her phone before my brother personally went up to her asking for our check. Our table was right in front of her and we had finished eating atleast 10 minutes prior. The food is good, but we will consider going to another establishment next time. The 2 stars are only for the food. I hope they fix these problems soon."

            "review": "Dim sum available all day is their ad which makes me somewhat apprehensive on such a claim.  I didn't try going there in the evening for their dim sum, but during lunch hours.  Pay attention as you walk in, look for their day's specials.  There were two boards listing different specials.  One of the offered steamed or crispy flounder USD 20.95, which caught my attention for a steamed flounder.  Order this first from a waitress, as it takes maybe twenty minutes before it arrives.\n\nMeantime, select dim sum plates as the rolling carts roll by, select one or two at time, finish those before adding more, else it's real easy to order more than you may comfortably eat.  Tea is complimentary here and is decent quality tea without a head charge for tea per person as some dim sum houses do.\n\nAdvise to not select starchy dishes (I.e. buns, noodles) as that tends to fill you, leaving less room for more dim sum plates.  Grab the dim sum prior to sitting at at table if you're concerned with their dim sum pricing which are broken down six groups, getting the dim sum menu demystifies this.\n\nThe steamed flounder turned out delicious.  Don't be shy about defining the whole flounder.  It's easy, or ask the waitress to define it for you.  Use the large tablespoon, insert into either the head or tail so bottom of the spoon comes in contact with the top of the fish bone structure and the top of the spoon contacts the bottom of the fish flesh, separating the flesh from the bone structure, carefully sliding the spoon from one end of the fish to the other end.  Save the sauce served on the fish, take it home in a sealed container for liquids or come with a quart sized sealable plastic baggie.  It goes well poured over steamed rice, much better than soy sauce, in my humbled opinion.\n\nDim sum personal favorites:  pan fried daikon cake A USD 2.25; steamed pork spareribs B USD 3; pan fried chive dumpling B USD 3; bean curd skin sheet roll B USD 3; baked egg tart B USD 3; pork siu mai B USD 3; shrimp har gow (has a nice thin translucent skin) B USD 3; shrimp paste in bell pepper B USD 3; shark fin dumpling B USD 3; sticky rice in lotus leaf C USD 4.1; deep fried taro C USD 4.1; salt and pepper calamari E USD 6.1.\n\nItems that I wouldn't recommend here:  mango pudding B USD 3 tasted totally artificial with a gelatin consultancy and request milk added.  I've tasted better elsewhere.  Roast duck, didn't try try it, looked not very good.  Prices may change, credit cards accepted.\n\nWe saw custard tarts rolled by multiple times, but by the time I decided to order a plate, they were finished for the day on that dish which was around 1430 hours.  So if they out of that one dish, what else would they be out of by the time they close at 2230 hours?  If you want dim sum, come by 1330 hours at the latest."

Sticky rice wrapped in leaves was okay, but I've had better, did not detect any mushrooms in the filling which is my favorite part. Shu mai was good. Shrimp dumplings okay. Leek dumplings were greasy. The chicken bao was good but could have used more filling. The shrimp rice noodle roll also lacked filling.

I had read reviews about it here and though the Orchids Garden would be my first time Dim sum experience. I read that they had takeout and thought \"that's great!\". So I went in today around 1:30pm to order some. This is where it started to turn sour for me. When I entered I asked the four waitresses waiting at the register if they had takeout. One waitress automatically pointed at the stack of menu's at the other end of the counter. My thoughts were \"OK, there are four of you, one is handling some customers paying for her food and the others are just standing there. Couldn't one of them just hand me a menu instead of me just having to make a wide berth around the customers to grab one?\". \n\n I didn't say anything but just went went around the other customers and got the menu they pointed out. The menu was for regular Chinese food that I could get anywhere with those prices. There was no dim sum listed. I remembered from reading about this restaurant on Yelp that they must have a dim sum menu. There were no dim sum menu's around the counter, and I didn't get a chance to ask because the same counter people (whom were still just standing there not doing anything) were still focused on the customer they were billing. I'm sure if I waved a brightly colored flag they still wouldn't see me. So I just left, paper menu still in hand.  I really don't know if I'll go back there.  I may just have my Dim Sum experience someplace else. Two stars to this place for at least getting in and seeing the menu."

            "review": "I must say that Dim Sum in Vegas is definitely an adventure. One has to find a balance between good quality and value. The best authentic dim sum place? I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden. \n\nDont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.\n\nThey have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.\n\nIf I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?\n\nTo put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?"

It's opened 24 hours and parking isn't horrible, but can sometimes get packed during weekend afternoons. Sometimes guests are turned off by the aggressive nature of the people handling the carts, but I completely get it, it's their job. I just smile and say \"no thank you\".  The dining room is huge, so even if there is a long wait, the wait isn't so bad. My favorite items are the BBQ pork buns, custard buns for dessert and the fried shrimp dim sum that you can completely engulf in the yummy mayo sauce they have. They do have a regular menu you can order off of too, if dim sum isn't your thing. If anyone has any other good dim sum recommendations in the Vegas area, please let me know :D"

Despite the number of people, we did not have to wait to be seated at all.\n\nIt has been YEARS since I've had dim sum in an actual dim sum restaurant so I was excited.  It was my companion's first time (ever) to a dim sum restaurant, and I think he liked it.\n\nI gave 3 stars because there were a lot of carts and a lot of different items to choose from, but not very many just meat or just veggie options.  We were seated quickly and our water and hot tea were brought at promptly as was our plain steamed rice (for my semi-picky 2-year old)  Also, a lot of what we ordered was a little greasier than I expected it to be.  I don't know the exact names for the items but I'll try my best to describe them.\n\nCHOW FUN: I think that is what the lady called it.  I'm used to chow fun being flat noodles cut finger-width and quickly sauteed with some meat and veggies and soy sauce.  This chow fun was kind of like one big sheet of rice noodle rolled up, then sliced into 1-inch logs and cooked in oil, soy sauce and chili.  Whatever it was, I liked it and would definitely order again.\n\nFRIED CALAMARI: Crispy, chewy, crunchy with a little spice (from a small amount of diced jalapeno).  It was alright.  I've had better and I've had worse.  My daughter had fun eating this one.\n\nPORK BUNS: We had two kinds. One steamed and I think the other was baked with honey on top.  Both had a sweet red pork filling.  I liked the steamed version while my companion preferred the softer, sweeter, baked version.\n\nTURNIP CAKE:  Kinda mushy, warm and Turnip-y.  It was how I remembered turnip cake to be (only back home they would fry it to order in front of you).  My companion did not care for it, but it reminded me of home.  I guess its an acquired taste, or a textural preference.\n\nEGGPLANT WITH SHRIMP PASTE:  I don't know if this is steamed or fried.  The shrimp part was alright; the eggplant was a little greasy and under-seasoned.  The server added a little mystery sauce (soy reduction or oyster sauce...I don't know) but that didn't really help.\n\nPORK SHUMAI: tasted like shu-mai? Kind of like the calamari: I've had better and I've had worse.\n\nCREAM  PUFF: that's what they called it.  It was a soft baked bun filled with a small amount of plain whipped butter and topped with shredded coconut.  We were disappointed.  It was alright, but not what we were expecting.\n\nEGG TART: simple egg  custard baked in a puff pastry shell.  My personal favorite... a little skimpy on the filling, but I didn't  mind.\n\nSESAME BALL:  it was just ok.  Crispy on the outside and semi-sweet on the inside.  The rice paste came out a little mushy/pasty instead of chewy.\n\nThe table next to us had some fried chicken wings but none of the carts we saw had them.  I did see some chicken feet pass by, though.\n\nI'd come back again...but I'd probably ask to see a menu, too...Just in case."
