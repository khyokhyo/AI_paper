            "review": "To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, I know St Mark's Square. And you Sir, are no St Mark's Square. \n\nBut pretty close.\n\nPostrio is a restaurant within tne Wolfgang Puck empire; from LA to takeshitma st in Tokyo. I'd like to say it's one of his more formal ones but those restaurant days are happily long gone.\n\nIt's situated within the faux st marks square in the massive shopping precinct of the Venetian. There's an internal, lesser used restaurant area and a lovely open veranda area and bar,looking onto the square and the Batali/ Bastianich complex across the way.\n\nWith the outside area, you have the advantage of hearing the musicians playing Neapolitan classics ( in Venice?) and enjoying the general atmosphere under the faux blue skies. Best thing is shouting at the mimes, knowing they can't shout back.  \n\n\n  We've been there twice, the first time having life changing truffles gnocchi. Sadly, on this visit, they were gone, but pleasantly replaced by similar ones filled with prime rib. Superb, but portions which would never be doled out by any Italian mama I know. Small would be a generous description. Also had the mushroom fettucine which was good.\n\nEnded with a cr\u00e9me burl which was superb.  \n\nA good culinary experience but I do believe they don't need to try experimenting with nouvelle cuisine portions, especially in Vegas. \n\nThey do offer regular 20% discounts for hote\n Guests and elsewhere as well."

            "review": "Great location and view within St. Mark's Square in the Shoppes at the Venetian, and I love that it has cozier, elegant \"inside\" dining as well as faux al fresco patio dining.  We were given an \"outside\" table, next to the bar.  \n\nThe menu looked good, and we had a large party so we ordered lots to sample.  I started with the Asparagus soup with Maine crab and black pepper creme fraiche.  It was excellent.   The chicken spring rolls were quite good - crispy, sweet and complex.  Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.  I went pretty basic for my meal - spaghetti and meatballs.  I felt this dish was uninspired and pedestrian.  The meatballs were undersized and had a very soft texture which did not sit well with me.  The pizzas were better than average, but we more than once looked longingly across the square at Ottos which specializes in pizza.  The rigatoni with fennel sausage bolognese was a step above the other main dishes.  \n\nOne last note - the wine was decent.  The waiter recommended a bottle of syrah that was a fairly impressive syrah, and very modestly priced.  \n\nOverall, I was expecting more from this restaurant."

The best thing I can say about the meal was that we were seated promptly. After that everything went downhill. For some reason it felt like our party was written off immediately after we sat down. We had 3 servers before the meal even came out of the kitchen and when the food did come out it was impossible to get a waiter's attention. \n\nI was expecting great food from a Wolf Gang Puck restaurant but was surprised to taste a rather bland pasta aka the Spaghettini Pasta w/ meatballs. The tomato sauce was not to my liking (there was no flavor) and the meatballs were red inside also, with no flavor. My fellow diners were not that impressed with their food either. The best dish at the table seemed to be the duck.  Being a foodie I was sad to find the best part of the meal was in a glass of wine.  \n\nThe restaurant is situated in the open in the middle of the Venetian Shopping Gallery. Definitely not a place to be romantic. Would have been good for our party if the service and food had tasted better. As there are quite a few options in Las Vegas for dining, I can't say that I would return after our lackluster experience."

When it comes to location and style, this location delivers and so does the food.\n\nTo say we had an amazing meal here, would be giving well deserved credit to it being, well...an amazing meal. We elected to eat here since we had a 20% off coupon set up with the hotel (we're jews, what can I say haha).  However, what did that 20% not include? Drinks. \n\nNeedless to say, I love moscato and they have great moscato. Along with that, our salads were very interesting and artfully designed. The gorgonzola was a bit disgusting, but I think that might be personal preference.\n\nSo, the porcini mushroom ravioli? Amazing. Seriously good stuff.  I'd suggest everyone to try it. I believe bass was on the menu too, which I had, and was equally excellent.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say other than that this is a must to get some food at, even if it is fairly expensive."

            "review": "One of the things I love about Las Vegas, and is one of the things rarely brought to attention when mentioning Vegas, is their fixation with designing interiors made to look like exteriors. Case in point - The Venetian. Everyone knows about the statues and the carefully painted walls of sky, but it's also nice that they coordinate their businesses to go with the outdoor theme indoors. Other case in point - Postrio (inside The Venetian). \n\nMy girls took me here for a pre-bachelorette festivities dinner. My first thought on in this place was \"Argh, another Italian place? Ok, just smile and pretend to like it.\" My second thought was, \"Oh cool, they've got sleek, modern-looking planters and an \"outdoor\" patio in front of the \"inside\" inside restaurant.\"\n\nI kicked off the meal with a glass of Sangria, pleasant, but not much kick and I've definitely had better (my fave is Fresca in San Francisco). I ordered the Porcini Mushroom Ravioli and a side of asparagus, I hadn't eaten since breakfast and thought the ravioli wouldn't be enough. \n\nThe ravioli skin was tender and the savory sauce marinated beautifully with it. I gave my friend a taste, and she liked it so much, she kept dipping her bread in it! \n\nThe asparagus was presented with two types - the traditional green and also, white. Sauteed asparagus seems a hard one to master, and though the dish was better than average, I'd suggest cooking longer as the outside was a bit chewier than I liked. \n\nAfter polishing off my meal, which would have been filling enough with just the ravioli, I had a bite of my friend's Spaghettini Pasta...it was phenomenal for just noodles and marinara! I literally had one bite, as I was very full already, but that spaghetti was likely the best spaghetti I've ever had.\n\nThe prices are steep for what you get, but for special occasions or for moments of 'I just feel like eating somewhere nice', this is the place to go."

            "review": "Ahhh, Postrio!  My husband treated me several years ago to a wonderful meal at this Venetian hotel/St. Mark's Square restaurant, and it was the highlight of our trip.  We have returned since to Vegas but hadn't had the occasion to visit Postrio again.  We have often talked about how wonderful that first visit was; the waitress was especially accommodating in making recommendations and the food was magnificent.\n\nGuess what?  This time was no exception!  We chose Postrio for a small business group dinner and were so impressed.  Appetizers we chose were crab cakes, the cheese/honeycomb/quince/pink lady apple/candied pecans, etc. plate, and the sausage trio.  All were excellent.  Our server, Erin, was exceptional in describing the main courses avalable, and as it was late my husband and two others chose the salmon.  All remarked on how tender and flavorful this meal was.  I have never tasted duck, having been told that it is very greasy.  Again, Erin's description had me intrigued, so I tried their special.  Such a wonderful dish!  \n\nAnother review mentions the chocolate beignets-if you love chocolate and don't want too sweet a dessert, this is the one for you!  Another in our party requested creme brulee (though it is not on the menu) and the chef made an especially lovely one with fresh berries.\n\nIt is not too fine a point to make that one member in our party was about an hour late.  Erin also had two large parties of wedding guests while we were dining - but we were never made to feel rushed or in any way less important.  I guarantee everyone was well-served.\n\nWe are definitely comfortable sharing this gem with our friends and business acquaintances.  Afterward, a trio of musicians treated guests to a lovely concert on the stage in St. Mark's Square, just beyond Postrio's \"outdoor\" dining area (we had eaten inside the restaurant itself).  \n\nIn all, another wonderful experience, and we look forward to returning soon!"

I assumed the food would be good since it is associated with a celebrity chef. I was not disappointed at all. The people watching was fantastic (chick in camo pants that had attached fluffy white feathers at the bottom of the pantleg) and the hamburger was supreme. I ordered the hamburger that is served with a red onion marmalade - I could eat that marmalade every day it is so good. The rest of the menu looked very interesting so I would definitely go back for more."

            "review": "Had Michael as our server, HORRIBLE service.\n\nOur treatment versus others around us was atrocious.  After ordering and chatting up with my friend she pointed to tables around us.  I noticed he was putting bread baskets down on tables and when I asked for ours he said it was available during request.  A couple sat down after us and I overheard him offer them a bread basket, then he offered it to other tables that sat down.  \n\nWe bought a bottle of wine like we usually do and he was never around to refill our drinks, I got up once to do it myself and a busperson came over to do it for me.  I took care of him since Michael wasn't around.\n\nAnd then another thing I overheard behind me, he told them the two specials that weren't on the menu.  Something about lobster and risotto I think, two of my favorite things!  We ended up ordering a filet mignon (alright), new york steak (alright), and the peanut souffle (damn good).  \n\nIf you dine here, do NOT risk your dinner experience with Michael as your server.  I still tipped him 20% because that's who I am but it'll be a toss up if you get shitty service or the stand in the middle of the restaurant where they place their order type of service.  Even the two managers on at the time weren't going around asking people how their meals or dining experience was going.  They seemed like an inseparable pair, always going off together and coming back to the podium together."

            "review": "This was my first visit to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.  I know that his brand has extended far beyond a size he could reasonably oversee on his own, but I was inspired by a book on food history I read that gave me new appreciation for Puck's early culinary breakthroughs and for contributing to the gourmet pizza trend that began in the 80s.\n\nI started my meal with the trio of house-made sausages served with three mustards and pickled vegetables.  This was a delicious dish, though really a bit too large to be served as a first course.\nFor my second course, I had to try one of his famous pizzas.  Since it is usually the simpler dishes that allow culinary genius to really shine, I opted for the margerita pizza and was sadly disappointed.  The pizza section of the menu was placed before the entrees, but this was misleading as the pizza was large enough to be an entree.  Now I expect large portions from chains such as the Cheesecake Factory, but here I would have expected quality over quantity and that was not the case.  The ratio of the ingredients was off with everything being dominated by a very thick layer of cheese.  The tomatoes were bland and the crust was a bit soggy under all that cheese.  When I did nibble on the bits of crust around the edge there was none of that amazing flavor you find in better pizzas or even the crusty/chewy combo to be had at places like Settebello.  Sadly, even Lavo has a better margerita pizza last time I checked.  This didn't exhibit any of the charectaristics of a high-end pizza.  My friend ate one piece and I didn't even finish mine.\nFor my entree, I selected the lobster roll, though after tasting it I think a better description would have been a BLT.  This sandwich was good, but not great.  The bacon dressing used on the sandwich was delicious and the Applewood smoked bacon was tasty, but between the two, overpowered the flavor of the lobster.  The grain bread and arugula was quite nice, but the tomatoes were flavorless and I found that unforgivable.  I work in the restaurant industry here in Vegas and know first hand that there are some amazing tomatoes to be had here.  Serving bland hothouse tomatoes in August is just plain lazy.  The amount of lobster actually in the lobster roll was not generous enough to be considered the main ingredient, though the chunks that were included were tender and delicious.  This was accompanied by a mound of french fries large enough to serve a family of four.  Really.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate beignets.  The presentation was lovely, with a large quenelle of caramel macchiatto ice cream, a small dish of vanilla dipping sauce and a small pile of chocolate beignets filled with a liquid chocolate center.  This was the one course where the portion size was appropriate.  The ice cream was fabulous - the flavors well balanced, the texture was very creamy and it paired well with the beignets.  The vanilla sauce was thicker than a classic anglaise and just right for adhering to the little doughnuts.  I loved the flavor of the beignets and thought the filling was a great idea, but it wasn't executed very well.  They were quite doughy in the middle- either from being under cooked or simply by putting the liquid ganache in the center while still warm.  Either way this kept the dessert from being as good as it could have been.  \n\nAnother disappointment was the service.  Our server was OK, but I felt rushed at several points during the meal.  Yes, my friend and I were doing a lot of talking, but I don't think that keeping our table for under 2 hours for four courses is unreasonable.  Two of the courses were cleared while I was literally still chewing food from my plate. I also would have expected the server to do something about the disappointing pizza.   Either take it off our bill or offer us something else, but when less than two pieces are eaten (between two people) that should be a flag that something is wrong.  In fact at one point after our pizza was cleared, but before our main course, the busser brought the pizza out in a to-go box and put it down on our table.  I wondered just what he wanted us to do with it.  It was too large on a very small table to fit the plates for our next course, so it had to be taken away again.  No problem, neither of us wanted to take it home.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad meal.  Some of the food was good and I did end up really enjoying my wine, but that isn't enough.  In this competitive food town, not bad, just isn't good enough to bring me back for seconds."

            "review": "The first tip I would give for diners at Postrio is to not sit \"outside,\" as they call it.  The inside of the Venetian is exquisite and luxurious and fantastic, but it's not ACTUALLY going to convince you that you're outside, and sitting on the \"patio\" outside the restaurant left us feeling like we were eating in a mall.  Go sit inside, which looked beautiful and quiet.\n\nThe sangria is tasty, but not the best I've ever had.  The cherry margarita was artificial tasting, and while everyone else at our table lauded the pom-ojito, I wasn't a huge fan.  They brought out warm tuscan bread with butter and olive tapenade, which I could have made a meal of all on its own.  I could go for some now, actually...\n\nOur food was kind of give-a-little, take-a-little.  The heirloom tomato caprese salad was easily the best I've ever had, with burrata that is gooey and creamy at room temperature, pesto oil, and a balsamic drizzle.  It was the kind of salad you eat slowly to let every bite spread out on your tongue.  I just wish it was bigger... one lump of burrata, four slices of tomato, $15.  Ouch, Wolfgang.\n\nTwo of us got the ribs, which got an \"eh\" review and came with onion rings that are a dead-ringer (HAR, get it?) for Sonic's.  Not a bad thing; I love Sonic onion rings, I just wouldn't expect to find them at Postrio.  My Mother got the chicken piccata special, which is normally dredged and sauteed, and came deep-fried, which was not mentioned on the menu.  She's not a deep-fried type of person, so little hiccup there.  Dad got the prime ribeye in a cognac mustard sauce with parmesan frites that was all so, so, so delicious, but came out rare when he ordered medium.  \n\nAunt got the bouillabaisse with seafood tortellini, which were cold, and apparently got hard when reheated.  She complained and was coddled by a manager, who comped her meal and brought her out dessert on the house despite her protests.  Super, super classy.\n\nI was the \"big winner\" with shrimp pesto pizza with broccolini, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, and something a wee bit spicey that was perfection.  The pizzas are some of the most reasonable things on the menu, and they're huge - our server, Brandy, said 10\", but I thought mine was closer to 11\" or 12\".  It went around the table and I STILL took home a slice and a half.  So much shrimp, so much pesto, so much crust... I'm drooling a wee bit.  \n\nMy pizza and the bread easily saved the rating, here.  OH, and dessert.  My aunt's strawberry shortcake was okay, but my cousin got a chocolate cheesecake for her birthday, and \"Happy Birthday\" was written on the plate in melted chocolate.  It was beautiful and yummy.  I got chocolate beignets filled with molten chocolate, served with caramel ice cream and a vanilla bean dipping sauce.  The doughnuts themselves were a tad salty, but the whole package together was perfect.\n\nThe general consensus after dinner was that it was way too pricey for the number of missteps, but the service was impeccable, and there were indeed some very high notes.  I think I'd go back for lunch, or even just for pizza and wine.  (What, you've never had?  It's secretly the world's most perfect combination.  That, or butter and olive tapenade...)"

I loved that the restaurant was located in the Venetian by the canal shoppes. It has the open airy feeling of dining outside in Europe! The food was good, and I'm glad the portions were medium sized! My favorite appetizer is the tuna tartare, totally melts in your mouth and the flat bread pizzas. The fried risotto balls and chicken skewers lacked flavor and were least popular. I think that needs to get off the menu! I was adventurous and ordered one of the specials of the day, which was the peking duck. Delicious & creative! Despite our large group, the food came out on queue and we all had a wonderful time!"

Decent bottles of wine can also be had for about $30 a bottle.  Postrio is located conveniently near the main entrance of the Canal Shops maze."

But the more I ate and the closer I got to the bottom, the saltier it got. So I ended up eating about half my dish. Kinda wish I had ordered the salmon instead. \n\nHowever, the location is great. Right on the one side of the square surrounded by shops. They were playing music (live) in the square so that was kind of good entertainment. I would recommend this place, maybe just not the chicken."

We are happy to join them and looked forward to having a first time experience at this restaurant. \n\nTwo seating areas of this place, the first being I guess what they would consider outside seating, they call it their patio cafe and bar lounge, however it really is not outside because this place is in the Venetian Grande Canal Shoppes. You feel like you're outside because of the setting within this shopping (I'll call it an upscale Vegas style) mall is all about the Trompe L'oeil, (painted to be realistic) you feel like you're in a Venetian style town complete with the canal waterway, restaurants, shops and yes even a sky. Upon entering and walking through the facade of what is outside, you enter into a very minimalist modern style dining room. \n\nThe menu is American with Asian and Mediterranean influence. But, to be perfectly honest with you... I can't remember what the heck I had for my main course, something Asian like, The dish I remember best was the incredible salad I had before my main course. Yes, it is true, the salad was the star. It seems so simple...Cappressi Salad, but it was not! I don't know how they did it... a couple maybe more, drizzles of fine olive oils, plate dotted with pesto or a sauce, basil based and of course a primo balsamic vinegar along with a dollop of the softest mozzerella and just the right garnish. They actually turned something simple into something extraordinary. I would have been happy with just this salad and a nice Champagne. Nice job."

It's really like two different restaurants, the \"outdoor\" more casual portion in Saint Mark's Square, great for people watching and enjoying the entertainment on the nearby stage, and the more upscale and romantic \"inside\" portion.  Every meal has been delicious, and the service has always been prompt and courteous, even the bussers.  Their filet mignon is perfect, and their pastas are outstanding, especially their spicy Bolognese sauce.  Also, their cocktails are the best we've found anywhere in town, their deserts are always delicious and interesting, and even their bread basket rocks.  We also like that we can visit this strip restaurant without having to walk through a smoky casino.  They have a new head chef, who has been introducing interesting specials, like rabbit and game meats.  We can usually find something disappointing everywhere, but we've never been disappointed by anything at Postrio.  We've enjoyed all Wolfgang Puck restaurants that we've tried, but this is by far our favorite."

And I'm not sure whether Wolfgang Puck's restaurant knows what it is supposed to be, either.\n\n\n Wolfgang Johann Puck is an Austrian celebrity chef, restaurateur, and businessman based in Los Angeles. Postrio, San Francisco, is one of his flagships, and he's replicated it here in Las Vegas. Located on St. Mark's Square in the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, the restaurant provides both casual and more formal dining. It offers a menu of seasonal American cuisine with Mediterranean influences, available either in an elegant dining room or a more casual setting on the patio of St. Mark's Square. Luchtime is patio dining only with a restricted menu.\n\n\n Puck is a great self publicist whose face is all over his web sites. He has enjoyed undoubted success and his restaurants have had rave reviews. But something has to give when a chef becomes a Brand (it's happening now in GB with Gordon Ramsey). In the case of Postrio, Las Vegas, both food and service have suffered. Postrio is in the top price bracket, so one does not expect ones waiter to be a non-english speaking Mexican, who clears plates whilst ones colleague is still eating. Miserly portions on plates decorated with squiggles of balsamic reduction have never impressed me, and this is what you get here.\n\n\n A very comfortable, well situated and attractive place, Postrio is nonetheless not worth the money.\n\n\n PS: Can anyone shed any light on the word 'Postrio'?"

Knowing we had limited time in the city, we did our best to plan for a dinner near our hotel (the Tropicana) and near where our show was (Planet Hollywood).  However, after much searching, we couldn't find anything that in that south part of the strip we'd risk that much money on a dinner for.\n\nIt was Saturday night over a hot and busy Vegas weekend, and it was getting pretty late before we had to decide on something.  So, we pulled out our smartphones -- one of us on OpenTable and the other on Yelp.  We agreed on Postrio and drove over.\n\nWe could not have been happier.  We were promptly seated in their \"outdoor patio\" area, and our waiter was quick with everything.  We had ordered the calamari, the herb pappardelle, and the prime rib eye.  Atypically, we skipped on any alcohol, but since we were already drinking for free the whole day out playing in the casinos, we thought we'd save some money on the alcohol (we also had a couple of bottles waiting for us in the hotel).\n\nThe pasta was just what I needed -- creamy and thick, yet delicate in flavor, and everything was fresh.  But, next time, I'm ordering the prime rib eye, because that cut of meat was probably the best I've tried in a long time.  Came with potatoes and veggies.  All of the serving sizes were substantial, we came out full.\n\nNow, I recommend doing your research on a place you plan to go to, before you go, because if you don't know what something is on a menu when you get here, and you don't have the balls to ask, then you shouldn't be disappointed when you order it, you get it, and you're not happy with it.  That said, I knew that Wolfgang Puck had a great reputation, his restaurants don't typically find me anything but satisfied, and the reviews on Yelp seemed promising.  I didn't want to order anything I didn't think I knew, so we went with pasta and steak and were extremely satisfied.\n\nEasily used my $20 OpenTable gift certificate, and the restaurant also did a beautiful complimentary birthday tiramisu.  Thanks, Postrio.  We'll be baaaaack!"

The hostess handled the change no problem and we were seated at one of the high tables.  \n\nI went with the asparagus soup for appetizer which was absolutely delicious.  Others went with the grilled chicken skewers which were also delicious.   For the main course I went with the linguine with clams and pancetta which was just awesome.  Another in our party got the salmon and that was one of the best, most flavorful salmon dishes I've ever had.  Not sure what all was in the seasonings, but just delicious.   Another in the party got the Schnitzel and that was easily the biggest meal of the bunch.  We also had one pasta with their bolognese sauce which was also very very good.   All in all an excellent meal.\n\nThe waiter was very attentive to the fact two of our party had dairy allergies and checking on each item before serving.  Even not serving the peanut sauce with the chicken skewers because it contains cream.\n\nRight off the bat we informed the waiter that we would all be paying separately and he told us no problem and at the end of the meal, he handled everything perfectly. So if you are a group all paying separately, just let them know when you sit down.  \n\nGood beer and wine selection as well in a very relaxed atmosphere.  We were seated out on the \"patio\" where you're out in the open St Marks square area of the Venetian.  Live music was playing off in the distance which was fun."

They were cool when I asked them to redo the dish and brought it back in a jiffy cooked through.  \n\nThey brought us a complimentary dessert to make up for the quail fiasco (cookies and creme brulee), which was also very nice.  \n\nOverall, service was outstanding, but the food...   Wolfgang, what happened?!"

I ordered a pizza with fennel sausage, cippolini onions, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese with a side of fries.  The pizza was good, but nothing worth writing home over, especially since the crust was a bit soggy and the sauce wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.  The fries, on the other hand, were exceptional.  They were crispy, salty, and hot (it also didn't hurt that they were served a garlic-herb aioli that I would dip just about anything in!).  The drink I ordered (hey don't judge, just because it's lunch doesn't mean I can't have a drink! plus it's Vegas!) was average and I could have likely had a better one for about 5 bucks at the bar down the street from me in New Orleans.  Good food, not great, but I won't judge chef Puck on this effort."

Everything I had was amazing!! \n\nWe started off with an array of different appetizers - the list consisted of various different pizzas, grown up pigs in a blanket, mini crab cakes, fried calamari, and this little fried mushroom and rice balls (I don't know the proper names). My favorite would be the fried calamari - it's salt and pepper calamari with rock shrimp and then topped with a sweet Thai chili sauce. It has that spicy kick to it! My second favorite was the dish I didn't know the name of (little fired mushroom and rice balls). They were so packed with flavor, that every bit I took I felt like my mouth was about to explode.\n\nWhen it came to dinner, even though I was super full, I had the lobster roll sandwich which came with a side of fries. The lobster roll sandwich was good and  huge. If I could only make a slight change, it would to have them put a little less of the mayo on the dish. Other than that it was really really good. So good that even though I was stuffed after the first bit, I pushed myself to eat one half of the sandwhich and then eat the other halfs lobter only. As far as the fries are concerned, they were made just how I like them. Super thin, crispy, and covered in salt and pepper. They reminded me of a better version of McDonald's. (I know I know I shouldn't compare these two places, but I do love there fries...Sorry).\n\nAs far as dessert, we had another array of desserts. Now even though I was super stuffed, I had a little bit of room for a taste test. We had apple strudel. mini chocolate donuts filled with camel, strawberry souffle, and a smore cake. My favorite was the smore came. Graham cracker bottom, dark chocolate fudge middle, and then topped off with a torched marshmallow. Yum YUm YUM!!!"

We waited about 15 minutes to get a table which is about average for a party of this size. Once seated we did have to wait another while before having water served. It seemed as though they were short staffed or just weren't prepared to have this many people at the restaurant on a Monday (12/31/12). We expected to have someone filling our glasses before going empty, but that is not what occurred. Our waters were filled, drink and food orders were taken, then we waited for what seemed like a longer while before our food was served. There were a few salads and soups ordered which were served prior to the main courses. The Butternut Squash soup was amazing! Salads were fresh and the anchovies were also fresh. The other dishes came out and looked appetizing. Pizza's were ordered and shared among the table. The Fennel Sausage pizza was a bit on the bland side and not what was expected as far as taste goes. It pretty much was a Pepperoni Pizza with a fancy name. The Mushroom Pizza on the other hand was delicious. The Goat cheese really added flavor to it and complimented the mushrooms. I'd give this restaurant another try if I were in the hotel again. Overall great food, not so great service for a restaurant of this category."

Basically I am a Wolfgang fan.  Good bread, always solid food, nice drinks.

I said \"Let's have one of those, then we'll order.\" She asked \"Would you like it for the table?\" \"Yes,\" I replied, \"We'll share it.\" So she brought two to the table. I only ordered one but it's just an appetizer, why not? So here we see two bowls of ice with a few small shrimp, a few oysters and half a baby lobster - $135 each.  Nice!

It goes to show that too many of his restaurants rely on his name to get business, instead of focusing on quality of food, experience, or innovation. Nothing was incredibly really bad about this, but the entire experience was incredibly forgettable and pedestrian. Price/quality ratio of food was just not good, and the food somehow reminded me of chain restaurant fare. The dining experience itself was also below average - the tables were cramped way too closely together, and I felt like I was squished in a corner and practically sitting on the diners at the next table.

It's actually really cute I mean you can pretty much eat on the patio \"outside\" under the \"sky\" in St. Marks Square! Super cute ambiance.\n\nMy review is only based on drinks and a couple appetizers. I would recommend getting their Moscow mule if you like them. It was the first drink on their menu and I usually get them but this was probably one of the best moscows I've had. The Ginger Beer was really good! I mean it had a great kick to it and I'm a little sad I didn't check to see what kind they used because it was really good! We also go the shrimp tempura and tuna tartare and I'm not sure if it's because I was starving but I thought they were good lol. I guess I should say my review is mostly about the drink I had lol- I still compare the ginger beer I had in that drink to any I have now. \n\nI'd probably come back to try their food but I really liked the ambiance and the the Mule so all in all I had a great time here for drinks and appetizers before going out for more drinks after."

You can eat on the patio and enjoy St. Mark's square, or the more formal dining room.\n\nEverything I've eaten here has been great, and very reasonably priced for the quality.   I've had the fliet, the duck and the tilapia (i think... it was like a year and a half ago. i know it was an obscene chunk of delicious fish).  However, the real stars of Postrio, as with any Puck restaurants, are the desserts.  I've twice enjoyed the pistachio gelato with port cherries.  So good.  So very good.\n\nThe formal dining room is great for a nice, romantic dinner.  The patio is great for something more laid back."

Our large group of 10 was really hesitant to grab the patio because we were in town during the fall when it's quite cold outside. Well, we had the faux outdoor dining inside the Venetian so the temperature was very comfy. \n\nThe service was okay, our server was slightly too slow in paying us attention and in our orders. They did help us celebrate my friend's birthday with a complementary dessert for her. \n\nFood was the tossup, really. The piece of calamari that I had was delicious, light and crisp. My friend Teri offered me some of her bouillabaisse and it was the best seafood stew I've had. Well, the downside was the reason why Teri offered me some of her food in the first place. My pumpkin tortellini, for $21, only had six measly pieces. The pasta itself was beyond al dente and was partially raw in the middle. There was not enough pumpkin stuffing inside. My friend Aries, who also ordered the same, and I looked at each other and thought that they might have split our order. There was nowhere near enough. That was the disappointing aspect of the dinner.\n\nAmbiance was great, the company was awesome, some deduction for the value, food, and service."

We originally wanted to go to the restaurant next door/across the walkway, but the waitresses/hostesses were super snobby and rude there, so we came here instead, where the employees were incredibly nice to us. \n\nWe had seen their happy hour everyday all day and was very curious in their small medium and large plates. Their prices even NOT on happy hour were very reasonable, especially for overpriced Vegas food and meals. We were seated at the bar for happy hour specials and were handed some complimentary popcorn from the bartender working there. After contemplating on the menu, we decided on:\n\n-wild mushroom pizza ($16): loaded with lots of mushrooms, but it was alright. for a restaurant that also had a pizzeria, i thought it would be fantastic! but the crust was kind of hard and the overall pizza was kinda cold.... \n-homemade meatballs ($6): comes in 3 meatballs the size of half a fist, maybe smaller and a slice of bread. The meat was soft when you bit into it. You cant really taste too much of the beef(?) but the sauce was delicious\n-garlic aoli french fries ($7): MMM this was the highlight of our meal. If you like soft or like yard house fries, you will definitely like this! They give you mustard and ketchup but you can really just eat it with no condiments. \n\nI would have given them a 3 stars, but the service was superb! The bartender checked up on us frequently and entertained us with questions and experiences about his trip to Europe. And when we packed the stuff to go, he gave us a cute little box for the pizza and an extra container of ketchup. \n\nOverall, i think this is a cute restaurant to go to for cheap food in Vegas! For under $30, you can feed two people for dinner! But then again, we had fat tuesday alcohol in our stomach and we're petite LOL"

Very smooth cut of tuna... but it was definitely no O-toro. I would have guessed it was Akami toro by the deep pinkish color of the cut. Very lean. Hardly any fats at all. I didn't care for the citrus taste. I thought it mashed weirdly with the olive oil and wasabi... but that's the risk with fusion, isn't it? Portion was also very small. 6 slices for $21. \n\nThe next dish we had was the seafood linguine - Medium plate. It was a huge portion! Highly recommend by the server and he did not disappoint!

It was our last meal in town, we were tired and ready to jump on the plane home and wanted something a bit more 'comforting'.  Postrio was able to provide this without fail. \n\nOur meal began with two tropical unsweetened iced teas (their standard iced tea) and an order of fritto misto of calamari, shrimp and summer veggies drizzled with balsamic vinegar and arugula.  It was cooked just right and the balsamic vinegar added a nice flavor (although to be honest, it took me a couple bites to figure out what the 'black' liquid was all over the food).\n\nThe husband ordered lasagna, which i personally wasn't all that impressed with - it seemed soggy and watery, although the sausage they used was homemade and tasted great.  He loved it.  I ordered an angus cheeseburger.  I asked for it to be cooked 'medium' and it came out medium well, which was okay since that is  what I usually order, but it definitely wasn't cooked as I had requested.  The fries were good and the pickle tasted homemade and I enjoyed every last crunchy bite of it.\n\nDessert was delicious as well and we had no problem polishing it off.  It was a blueberry gelato served over a blueberry crumble.  It was very good, but nothing phenomenal.\n\nIf you're looking for a culinary adventure, the cafe may not be the best stop, but it's great for a slightly upscale casual meal (with an upscale pricetag to go with it).  The cafe wasn't full and seems to be readily available without reservations."

I personally would never order it.. but he would totally order over and over again.\n-they have a kids menu.... and my daughter got the cheesy pasta... it was simple and my daughter cleaned her plate. Too bad that you have to order each thing separately... we had to order her milk separately... which was like an extra $2.50 or $2.75.\n-SANGRIA.. was really tasty. the apples were really crisp. The pitcher was only $25.. how can you beat that?\n\noh.. and the bread.. VERY GOOD... crusty on the outside and soft on the inside... and the olive tapenade that they serve with is.... mu-ah! I could just eat that ALL day long!\n\nOverall... will definitely be back!"

We were seated after waiting about 10 minutes in the inside dining room, which was nice. We waited over 15 minutes before our drink order was taken by a very disinterested server. We then waited over 25 minutes for our drinks to arrive. The dining room was only half full on a Sunday evening. \n\nI had taken finally ONE sip of my drink and the food arrived less than two minutes after the drinks arrived. Ar this point we were not happy with the constant delays and the continued disinterest by the server. \n\nMy husband's liver/onions was delicious. My roasted potatoes were also very good, but the crab cakes were mushy and tasteless. I only ate one of the four very tiny crabcakes. They did take 1/2 of the cost of the crabcakes off of the bill, which was a nice gesture, but we were annoyed by the delays and poor attitude. We had been looking forward to a relaxing evening after a long day of business, but instead left quickly and without ordering anything else. Had the service been good, I could have been much more forgiving with the blah crabcakes because the rest of the food was very good. We wont be back."

            "review": "Went here for dinner with my girlfriends when we first got to Vegas.  I've been to Spago in Caesar's before, and thought it was very similar.  I was really looking forward to their pizza since I loved the pizza both at Spago and at Wolfgang Puck Express, and while it was good here, it didn't seem as good as what I've had before...I think the crust could have been a little thinner and more crunchy.  All 3 of us were starving though so we practically inhaled the pizza anyway.\n\nFor main course, I got the burger, which was excellent and perfectly juicy...I only wish I hadn't filled up too much on their pizza since this was so much better.  The fries were perfectly fried, and crispy just the way I like it.  I was already way stuffed but I kept picking at the fries towards the end of the meal.\n\nProbably my largest criticism here is that their wines by the glass really sucked.  I gotta admit that I'm a little picky when it comes to wines, but for a \"nice\" restaurant like this, I thought that I would at least get something that didn't make me grimace when I drank it.  I got the pinot with the pizza, which was bleah and a little vinegary to me (maybe it had been open for a while?), then got a malbec with my burger which was a little better but still meh.  I got several $10-$20 bottles at home that taste better than this stuff.\n\nOne thing I really liked though was the location.  You had that pseudo-outdoor feel with the fake sky and all, kind of reminded me of those restaurants in italy with the outdoor tables.  Of course in this case, you're in a mall, but it was nice nonetheless, and we got to people-watch as we ate dinner (always a fun thing to do in Vegas).\n\nBoo for them though for not giving me the 1000 points for the opentable reservation when I booked it on my iphone (it was 1000 points when I looked it up on my pc earlier).  At least we had a 25% off coupon that came with our room at the Venetian, so our whole dinner wound up being pretty reasonable (for Vegas).\n\nAll in all, don't really regret going here, since we had a discount and they took reservations at the last minute, but don't know if I would actually seek out this place again given that there are so many great restaurants in Vegas."

Of our table setting, we had one filthy plate and one cracked glass that the wait staff failed to notice. When we ordered, our waiter (who \"conveniently\" failed to give us his name) kept us waiting much longer than the other guests. When we asked, he explained that the restaurant was packed inside (no, it wasn't) and that exact words: \"well-done burger doesn't help\". Because we ordered our burger charred?\n\nBefore we ever saw our food, we asked for the manager to address our concerns. He finally came out right when the food did, which by the way came out all at different times, and his timing couldn't have been better. Our food was finally there. The gnocchi - cold. The pizza - cold. Our burgers - overdone.\n\nThe manager didn't even do anything! When we talked to him, he had NOTHING to say. We ate the cold, unsatisfying meal and when we wanted to leave, the manager was kind enough to order desserts for us, which we also waited for. By then, our count was almost an hour of waiting.\n\nDespite talking to the manager, the service still didn't improve. Not once were we asked if we needed something else or if the food was good. \n\nSimply put, I will not be returning."

It was a 'reasonable' $35 and served on a bed of beluga lentils + greens.

Very creative and well made drinks are enough to keep me coming back, especially the cognac and lemon juice martini, mmm mmm!\n\nMost recently we ordered:\n\nMargarita Pizza - Straight forward mozzarella flavor, nothing developed or complex, very underperforming pizza.\n\nSalt n' Pepper Calamari and Shrimp -  Perfectly light and flaky coating, good flavor, delicious sweet chili dipping sauce, just a good appetizer.\n\nChopped salad - What was he thinking?  This salad worries me, it shouldn't  be on the menu.  There are what I take to be pickled figs in here, which do what capers often do to dishes, overpower them.  This unbalanced bowl of greens is an expensive mish mosh of salad bar rejects.\n\nCesar Salad - Very crisp lettuce and a light dressing were a nice way to continue through our meal.  Think Cesar Salad's less chubby cousin.\n\nPumpkin Tortelloni in Brown Butter Sage sauce - Overpowering sage flavor, whoa!  The pasta itself was very well made, and I had no issue with the pumpkin in the noodle, but the sauce failed to accentuate anything on the dish.  It really just screamed Sage, and not in a good way.\n\nBesides the good location, Namesake, and drinks, Postrio falls short of being a great restaurant."

A large bridal party was behind us and they were having the time of their lives! The vibe is FUN FUN."

            "review": "I had been meaning to check out the burger at Postrio, and I was already at The Venetian checking out the eternal twilight of Saint Mark's Square. This Wolfgang Puck establishment delivered the culinary equivalent of \"bad touch\" from mom's new boyfriend. I should have known that everything was going to go terribly wrong from the painful interaction with the server..\n\nMe: What are the cuts of beef in the burger?\nShe: Angus.\nMe: That is a type of cow. I am more interested in the parts of the cow that the meat comes from so that I can order my burger cooked to a temperature that is most appropriate. Can you please go check?\nShe: *huff*\nMe: Am not trying to be a pain; I am trying to order the burger correctly so that I can properly review it.\n\nI assumed that she was new or fussy or just plain bad at her job. I failed to take this as an omen. The other clue was that the restaurant was all but empty in the middle of the bustling St. Mark's Square. Postrio was Italian slang for \"crappy food and service.\"   \n\nThe beef was flavorful and beefy. Sadly, it was over-cooked and rubbery. The burger patty had the shape and texture of a fist. Beyond that, the burger was peppered with connective tissue. \n\nThe burger's exterior tasted like an oniony salt. It was as if it had been dusted with cheap onion soup mix.\n\nThe bun was stale and dry...really dry and stale. The bun was burned to the point of tasting like carbon. The bottom of the bun had black grill marks, which imparted a nasty bitterness directly to the tongue.\n\nThe kitchen at Postrio phoned it in and subsequently dropped the ball. After I sent my meal back, there was no offer for a refire or a make-good of any sort. Apparently, that was their best effort.\n\nThe manager, Luckas, agreed that the bun was burned and stale and that the burger was rubbery. I sent my plate back after a scant 3 bites.My son got through a third of his before he gave up due to the strong flavor of char. I was granted the \"friends and family discount.\" Postrio only charged me $37 for that shameful mess. Jerks!\n\nFront and back of house were a well-oiled machine designed to lighten wallets and deliver awful food. Postrio earned the title of worst burger in Las Vegas. On the day that I visited, the quality of the burger and service was excremental, and that was being generous.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth over email, Postrio did refund the cost of the meal."

We ate an early dinner, around 5:15pm (we had a show at 7), and there was no wait.  In fact, it was pretty much empty except for a few diners.  Here's what we had for dinner:\n\n1) Caeser salad (split): Pricey and small, but it was good.  Wolfgang sure knows how to pick out his cheeses.  The sliced parm on the salad was fantastic.  My gf usually doesn't like cheese and even she thought it was very tasty.\n2) Pepporoni pizza: Pretty decent pizza.  Not the best I've ever had, but it was good.  Crust was baked thin and crispy, sauce wasn't overwhelming, pepporoni was tasty, and the sliced tomatoes were a nice touch.\n3) Chocolate Souffle: This wasn't very good.  Though it only took 15 minutes to make, this quick rise souffle was waaay overcooked.  The vanilla bean sauce was good, but the souffle tasted like a chocalate cupcake.\n4) Pitcher of sangria: Probably one of the best sangria's I've ever had...it was REALLY refreshing after a day of vegas.  The amount of sangria in the pitcher is perfect for two people.  The pitcher set me back $25, but this IS vegas afterall.  Filled about 6 wineglasses so it's actually not a bad deal.\n*) Almost forgot to mention that they have a very tasty bread.  Loved the chewy texture.\n\nI had a great experience here and will definitely return.  There's just something about sitting and eating under the venetian blue sky that soothes the mind.  I'd recommend the cafe sitting over the indoor restaurant.  While it looked nice inside, it didn't feel romantic.\n\nIf it wasn't for the souffle, this place would've recieved 5 stars."

Yes it was a bit pricey, but the food was excellent. The Prime burger with the garlic aioli was absolutely delicious, as well as the Pink Lady Apple salad. Quite possibly the only salad that I've ever actually enjoyed. However what actually made me make an account and write this review is the service. Very kind and accomodating. I was eating someone with some dietary restrictions, and they were very helpful. Also they did take very long with our order due to some complications in the printing system. We hadn't even noticed, but they gave us two complimentary truffle chips and bleu cheese. Those too were phenomenal. I highly recommend this place."

It is by far the best choice in the St. Mark's Square area of the Venetian. \n\nI was able to sample several of the dishes on my last trip to Vegas and the only disappointing part, as far as food is concerned, was the aioli that the pomme frites come with. I just wasn't into it. The shrimp cocktail was very filling, with incredibly jumbo shrimp, and a trip of dipping sauces. The pumpkin soup was fantastic, complete with pumpkin seeds. My husband ordered the fettuccine, which, despite what you may think is not in an alfredo sauce, and found it to be fantastic. I tried two of the salads (field greens and chef) and they were both very good and hearty enough to act as a lunch entree when paired with another appetizer or side. I loved the tapenade that came with the flatbread they serve to the table. \n\nThey have a nice little wine by the glass list including a very good albarino. What I enjoyed the most was their diverse tea list. After selecting one I was most pleased to have the loose leaves steeped perfectly in a little cast iron tea pot delivered to my table. \n\nThe one drawback here was service. During one of my lunch experiences here we waited nearly an hour for our food in a restaurant that was not very busy. However, slow service during lunch seems to be a hallmark of Wolfgang Puck restaurants so I should have known better."

I read the menu online and had hoped to try the puree of sweet corn soup but the menu had changed.  I tried the pumpkin soup, as it is the holiday season, and I liked it.\n\nLuckily, the lobster club sandwich I wanted to try wasn't left off the menu.  I take pleasure in trying a restaurant's twist on a classic, like the club, and the apple wood smoked bacon worked with nine grain bread but overwhelmed the lobster.  The classic or the twist?  It's a toss up.\n\nTo finish...  The meal ended a lot like it began, a changed up dessert menu, but I can't complain.  Not after eating an appetizing apple strudel coupled with pecan ice cream and a caramel.  Yum.  Yum.\n\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed.  Yelp's reviews were up and down, but Wolfgang Buck's Cut and Spago in Los Angeles are amongst my favorite restaurants.  I'd happily eat here again, but I wouldn't walk up and down Las Vegas Blvd. to try some selections from their menu, which may or may not be there after I've arrived."

Why can't I seem to remember much that happened to me before here, but somehow I have a strong feeling I need to be here to fulfill a promise... what? I don't know.\n\nMy senses... smell, touch, sound, sight... all coming to.  Where is this place?  This place seems so familiar to me, but I know it's not home.  Looks like a place I've seen somewhere in books, in pictures, on the internet at one point in time in my life.  I see lots of people and beautiful shops.  Many look like tourists.  I hear the voice of a tenor serenading... the soothing echoes of a language I can't seem to understand find me through this leisure crowd.  The overwhelmingly pleasant aroma of italian spices is making my stomach sing a very different song.  I need to get something to eat.  As I walk along shops of elegance and charm, I see a canal where boats carry lovers throughout this seemingly romantic place.  Ah yes... these boats... I know these boats.  They are gondolas!  Venice, Italy!  But how did I manage to get all the way here when I'm sure I was in the US last night?!?!  This is starting to scare me.  If I retrace to the last thing I remember, it would be.... Las Vegas.  I was in Las Vegas walking into a club.  Now I'm in Venice.  Everything in between... nothing.\n\nI feel something in my pocket.  My phone is going off.  A text from my friend. \n\nSonja: Are you here yet?  I'm hungry!  My break is only 45 mins!\nMe: You're in Italy too?\nSonja: What are you talking about?  I thought we were doing lunch during my break?\nMe: I don't know but I'm sure I'm in Venice right now because I see gondolas and I hear someone singing in Italian.\nSonja: OMG!  Quit messing around and hurry over to St. Mark's Square!  I'm here.\nMe: I'm serious.\nSonja: Are you still drunk? You're not in Venice... You're at the Venetian... where I work... in Las Vegas... you drunkie!!!!!  \nMe: Oh....... It all makes perfect sense now!  See you in 5 mins.\n\nHangover 4?  Nah.  It'd just be a blank script.  What this hungry dude needs is a good brunch to fill his blank inner canvas with flavor.  In matter of minutes, I found my friend arms crossed, tapping her toes, giving me that \"fail\" smirk right in the heart of St. Mark's Square... a beautiful open space where different restaurants are set up for outdoor dining indoors (was that an oxymoron?).  She says, \"My lunch is short now because of you... let's go Postrio since it's quicker.\"\n\nService is amazingly friendly and welcoming.  To feed my hangover and empty belly, I order the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict w Crispy Seasoned Potatoes.  It's so good!  Eggs perfect with oozy yolks and the hollandaise has just the right touch to go with the toasted english muffin and savory smoked salmon.  Potatoes are so nice and crispy with a very appetizing seasoning.  I see chicken apple sausage and have to add that to the side.  Get it.  Juicy bites of sweet n savory sausage makes the perfect addition to an all American meal.  I'm stuffed.  \n\nIn my confused state of existence, I couldn't ask for a better brunch... familiar and American, in an Italian setting, below gorgeous weather, where gondolas float, love birds cuddle, tenors serenade, and hungover people grub.  Ok... person.  I think I was the only one there hungover.  \n\nRemember.  You are at the Postrio... Here at St. Mark's Square, Venetian, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.  Not Italy."

            "review": "Postrio is one of many Wolfgang Puck restaurants in Vegas.  I read somewhere that Puck has single-handedly put Vegas on the map as a culinary destination.  Back in the day (before my time), Vegas was home to $1.99 pancake breakfasts with a slice of ham steak and two eggs any style and all-you-can-eat buffets comprised of questionable food stuffs.  Now, you will find so many top chefs have taken a gamble (no pun intended) and opened high-caliber restaurants thus further raising the bar for newcomers.  \n\nPostrio has two separate dining areas with corresponding menus, the \"outdoor\" and indoor areas.  We chose the outdoor seating because we were accompanied by my darling two year old nephew. \n\nI order a small plate of heirloom melon with prosciutto, figs and a cheese filled cookie/cracker sweetened by honey.  It was delicous.  All of the flavors blended seamlessly.  The only thing that irritated me a bit was the fact that the servers brought my salad/small plate at the same time they served my entree.  Personally I prefer my salad as a first course then the entree.  But the taste of the item (delish) made up for the weird timing.\n\nMy dad and I were still pretty full from lunch so we split the margherita pizza.  Since Wolfgang Puck is synonymous with pizza, it was a must try.  Very tasty.  For dessert we all split this really yummy strawberry cream puff pie.  OMG so yummy!  Postrio's is a nice place if you want to have a relatively quick, but tasty bite of food."

He was quick, and really nice. Not particularly memorable, but he does his job and he does it just fine. The cups, dishes, and silverware were all really cute. When I see a table set well, I can really appreciate it! Everything was well thought out--the geometrical shapes of everything, the colors...it was just really pleasant to look at.\n\nThe food was interesting. There were very unique dishes. We ordered an appetizer of the three sausages with mustard, and they were amazing. Each sausage had a different flavor, and I believe two of them were filled with pistachios. I'd never had that before, but I have to say I loved it. The three different types of mustard and three different types of sausage sure as heck wasn't boring. Lots of experimentation occurred, and we even discussed which pairings we liked the best. My actual entree was a pizza topped with pesto and shrimp. It was pretty good, but the pesto shrimp got a little too salty. I still enjoyed the appetizer more than i did the entree, which would have been the only reason why I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4."

I try to avoid carbs, and therefore asked for asparagus instead of potatoes with my halibut...just as my husband did. While my husband received a lovely portion of asparagus, I received three \"flecks\" and I do mean flecks of asparagus embedded in the creamy corn stuff my fish was on. When I inquired as to the whereabouts of the substituted asparagus, the first words out if the waiters mouth were \"I don't control the portions.\" Next \"did you want me to get you some more?\" As though I were imposing on him with my question. All in all my halibut was flavorless and the service was disappointing. I expect more from a Wolfgang Puck eatery. Boo."

Besides that, it was outdoor-cafe like seating (well it's in the Venetian, so it's more pseudo-outdoor).  \n\nThe sausage platter for starters was fabulous.  It had three different types, a chicken w/ sun dried tomatoes, a pistachio with pepper, and a smoked garlic apple.  it also included three mustard to compliment them as well.  The sweet apricot mustard was intoxicating and blended well with all the meats.  The standard Dijon and ale mustard's were quite bold and went well with all as well.\n\nThe halibut was extremely buttery and tender.  The vinaigrette and condiments that came with it truly was a great mixture of flavors.  And the Pork Wierneschznitzel was extremely good as well.  It was buttered  and seasoned to perfections with a perfectly baked panko crumb crust.\n\nThe service was great and the prices weren't astronomical to break the bank either.  Plus you don't have to wait forever like the restaurant section, and the serving portions are very generous."

The chili sauce was a great accompaniment. Hubby ordered the lasagna and I had the linguine with clam sauce. Both were wonderful. You taste the freshness in the ingredients. \nThe following night we came here for my birthday and sadly because we didn't make reservations, they didn't have seating available. Lucky for us!!! We wound up sitting where we had the best service during our entire stay in Vegas, including dining at CraftSteak which was terrible. Anyhew, our bartender Min was on top of everything. The food was again fantastic!! We had the calamari again and it was consistently good. For dinner hubby had the spaghettini with meatballs and I had the mushroom ravioli. Again, fantastic!! You seriously can taste the freshness of the pasta and other ingredients. \nFor dessert we had the Smore Pie at the recommendation of Min. Again, another winner. We will absolutely be back and happily sit at the bar where you get the best service as well as great food. You can't beat that in Vegas. \nI almost forgot, the price is VERY reasonable compared to other restaurants in Vegas. Earlier this week had dinner at CraftSteak, paid over $100 more for lesser quality food and service. At Postrio we paid less and got soo much more in terms of quality and service. I can't wait to come back."

The calamari was cooked perfectly. But the standout is definitely the house-made sausages with the different mustards. Pretty yummy!\n\nMain Course:\nSteamed Black Mussels in White Wine Garlic Broth, Grilled Sourdough with B\u00e9arnaise Sauce\n\nThe mussels were plump, fresh, and cooked perfectly. The white wine, garlic broth was good. It would have been perfect to sop the sourdough into the broth, but unfortunately they smothered the bread with b\u00e9arnaise sauce, which I didn't care much for.\n\nDesserts:\nChocolate Beignets, Caramel Macchiato Ice Cream\nBourbon-Peach Bread Pudding, Butter-Pecan Ice Cream\n\nOur waitress selected the two desserts for our table as a birthday celebration for my friend. I dipped a beignet into the vanilla sauce, topped it with a spoonful of caramel macchiato ice cream, and then ate the whole thing in one bite. It was good with the liquid center. Not too rich or heavy.\n\nOverall, our meal at Postrio was A-OK and pretty standard. Nothing particularly new or outstanding in terms of flavor, but everything was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. We chose to sit \"outside\" at St. Mark's Square and while we had to endure groups of tourists gawking at us, we also got to enjoy a beautiful, live performance by The Venetian Trio throughout our entire dinner. And it was quite cute that there was a lone pigeon walking around on the fake cobblestone.\n\nAs an apology for forgetting one of the main course orders at our table, they comped a $20 \"birthday celebration\" fee, so that was a nice gesture. But wow, do they really charge $20 to write happy birthday in chocolate on a dessert plate?"

The shrimp is still it's in its shell and won't be served in a glass. The shrimp were actually quite delicious and very meaty. The cocktail sauce was decent. Was it the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had? No. Was it better than the average shrimp cocktail. Yes. If you do decide to go to Postrio despite my review you can be assured the shrimp cocktail is not the reason why I gave Postrio two stars.\n\nMy main entree was the capellini pasta with grilled shrimp, calamari and spicy tomato sauce. You may notice that the menu actually includes mussels as well, but there were no mussels present in my serving. Also the capellini seemed overcooked and mushy. This was a huge disappointment. I can expect sub par pasta from a restaurant that doesn't specialize in Italian cuisine, but considering this is an Italian restaurant and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant no less, I was extremely disappointed.\n\nUndoubtedly you can find a better Italian restaurant on the strip otherwise you're up for a huge disappointment at Postrio."

            "review": "In short: Delicious seafood (oysters and mussels) with fantastic pasta.\n\nAs I have been brainwashed by the cheese platter at Batali's San Marco right across the way at the Venetian, I had never noticed this place except that Wolfgang Puck has some restaurant in the corner.  Club Grazie sent me a complimentary dinner here so I checked it out with the GF this past Wednesday evening.\n\nWe were seated inside (would have been a 10 minute wait outside.  Inside is mood lit, clean, and less distracting which is great for a date and/or you're ugly (as in my case).  It felt more formal inside too, but the outside is nice if you want to see/hear the violinists or jesters, but you may also enjoy the crowd of tourists passing by.\n\nHere's the menu: (http://www.venetian.com/uploadedFiles/The_Venetian/Dining/Fine_Dining/PostrioDinner0410.pdf)\n\nVery friendly and accomodating waiter, simple wine menu (I like that). Also of note, the bread and butter comes with a crushed olive/basil/olive oil dipping sauce for the Italian bread that was really good.\n\nWe started off with a few of the kumamoto oysters which were phenomenal.  It's funny how you can get some of the freshest seafoods and meats in the middle of the desert.\n\nWe then split the caesar salad which had a nice deconstructed take on an old favorite.  It has a very flavorful white anchovie slice served with whole lettuce leaves which are tossed with the caesar dressing which IMO had the perfect balance of acidity and creaminess.  Great salad and it might be the first one where I've needed a knife to eat.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the steamed black mussels in a white wine sauce and the GF got the spinach lasagna with meat sauce.  My one let down was the bearnaise sauce that covered the bread with my mussels.  It was too sweet, sour, and creamy for my taste, the GF didn't like it either.  The mussels tasted great, but I was not blown away, it was about what I expected when ordering steamed mussels.\n\nThe GF's spinach ravioli on the other did blow me away.  I recommend this dish to anyone who likes pasta in meat sauces.  I'll upload some of the iphone pics in a bit, but the pasta was perfectly soft and the meat sauce had great flavors of the beef and sausage.\n\nFor dessert, save room for the beinet.  Fried chocolate doughnuts with chocolate and caramel inside that melts in your mouth, served with coffee ice cream and a vanilla sauce... We got them on the waiter's recommendation and they turned out to be one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.\n\nNext time I'll try the linguine in white clam sauce and the four cheese ravioli since the pasta was so good.  The pizzas didn't look special from the other tables, so I'll stick with San Marco when I want a pizza."

The waiter was visibly annoyed when my wife asked for bread with her salad.  We didn't load up with lots of wonderful different dishes, nor did we come at dinner time. My wife had the caesar salad with chicken, and I had the pizza with baby squash, roasted chicken and smoked mozzarella.  I regretted not getting the pizza with the fennel sausage but my pizza was fine, as was my wife's salad.  The chicken was good, but there really wasn't anything exceptional about our meal.  Maybe it was what we ordered.  I don't know.  But still, it was fine, if a bit pricey for what we got."

Not a huge fan of lettuce wedges because they are a pain to eat.  It always ends up going everywhere.  The dressing was good though.\n\nI had the scallops which was a nightly special.  Seared scallops, roasted vegetables and a pea pistachio puree.  The scallops were cooked well but that puree was just odd.  Not a great flavor and this dish would have been a lot better without it.  At least the company I was with was good!\n\nThe food was really nothing special, but it is a cool little atmosphere.  Located in the Cannal Shoppes and if you sit on their version of a \"patio,\" you can entertain yourself watching the little performances staged near the restaurant.  For those of you who choose your restaurants to accomodate rug rats, I think if you sit in this area, it would be good for kids.  We had a 3 month old with us and it provided easy access to the closest bathroom for diaper changes!"

The fresh pasta was excellent and the corn and ricotta was a creative combination. I wouldn't get it again, would go for a different pasta dish. \n\nWine list was good with several reasonably priced wines by the glass (hard to find in Vegas).

I can't think of a better location for Postrio than at St. Mark's Square in the Venetian Hotel, i.e., great food with the romantic ambiance of Venice...minus the expensive flight to the real thing.  \n\nThere are two seating options.  You can dine in their formal dining room which is more elegant and intimate or you can opt  for a more casual setting on their patio.  We opted for the patio so we could people watch and sit under the artificially painted blue skys of Italy.  \n\nI'm a big fan of fusion food and I would label this restaurant as an American, Asian, and European fusion restaurant.  What was good here?  Everything we had.  Most notable was the Lobster Club Sandwich.  I know what you're thinking...a sandwich....how good can a sandwich be?  Well, let me tell you...my husband and I had this lobster club 6 years ago and to this day, I still dream about it.  It's that good.  \n\nI long to sink my teeth into another lobster club, but don't think I'll get that opportunity again until my kids are older.

I was impressed with the nice cafe atmosphere and the menu was smiple enough, so we gave it a try.\n\nWe were seated and it took a moment for us to get the server to acknowledge our presence after taking our drink order.  I'm not sure whether he was waiting for us to signal him down, but it took about seven  minutes from our drinks to taking our order.  I was a little frustrated at this, but wanted to give him a second chance and so we ordered our food and waited.\n\nThe salad came five minutes after he took our order, two Caesar's,  one without anchovy.  Their salad is baby romaine lettuce stacked on each other with grated cheese, tossed in the dressing and served with one crouton.  The flavors were good and a nice change from the tossed, chopped ones I get at Morels or Golden Steer.  that was 19 dollars.\n\nThe food took about 18 minutes after the salads to arrive.  I felt that this was quite long and was trying to flag a server down to ask if they could check for our food.  Either we looked too young to take seriously, or I caught this place on a bad day, but it is still no excuse for the lack of attention we received.  We ran out of water and drinks awhile back and no one checked up on us, so that was a bit frustrating.\n\nWhen our food did arrive, it was presented well and the portions were a good size.  The large spaghetti was split between my niece and fiance in two separate bowls and looked like a hefty portion, so the 17 dollar price tag was understandable.  The pizza was large as well, about a medium pizza if you order delivery.  The lobster sandwich looked like a good size, too, but instead of a kaiser roll they use toasted grain bread.\n\nPepperoni, olive and tomato pizza with fresh basil: Good crust, nice taste to the dough as well.  the toppings were lovely and had a nice, salty flavor.  The olives were good and not cooked all the way through, but that was fine for me because I don't mind the texture.  Overall, the pizzas at any Wolfgang's are good.\n\nSpaghetti with meatballs: Five dollars extra for those meatballs, just to warn you.  The pasta is made fresh there, and you can tell by the color and texture of the pasta.  It came roma tomato chunks and lots of cheese, so that was nice.  The sauce had that right amount of tanginess to it and spice.  The meatballs are very good and well flavored.  you still get the meat taste with a hint of Italian spice.  Quite a lovely meal.\n\nLobster sandwich: Good lobster, very sweet and succulent.  It's a cold sandwich, of course, so the mayo and other ingredients mixed with the lobster were really fresh and light.  The bread is heavy, however, so my husband took the tops off of the halves to avoid getting overfilled.  The fries and skinny fries and are your typical hotel fries.  Overall the sandwich had good flavor but we expected something more.  It almost felt as if this particular dish was missing something, but I couldn't place my finger on it.\n\nFor 160 dollars for lunch (I did tip 20% because the service went up from the meal, on) it was okay.  I am not a fan because of the initial service we received, but the food was good.  I like Puck's restaurants, but I won't go out of my way to eat here again.\n\nIf you like the cafe feel in Venetian and want something fair and fast, this is the place to go.  I know people are giving it five stars for food, but for my personal taste it wasn't exciting and lacked any \"wow\" factor that it should have for that price tag.  Still, it's fair eats."

It was fired at a high temperature with a salt/pepper crust and the inside was bloody as hell, just like I ordered. Was topped with caramelized onions and had a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes which were very well-made. Although there are other places I would dine at in Vegas before this one, it's definitely worth stopping by and shelling out a few bucks if you find yourself in the hotel."

I had the mushroom tortellini and that was very good.  The sauce was probably the best part of the dish.  My wife had pan fried scallops.  The scallops were perfectly cooked, but my wife was not too fond of the sauce that came with it.  In fact, she started dipping her scallops in my sauce.  All in all, nice ambiance and good food.

We had noticed that they were offering a discount off the bill total if you were seeing the show that day. (25% off). Unfortunately, the ad and the reservationist forgot to mention that in order to receive the discount, the server needs to keep your show tickets, so you're only suppose to eat there after the performance. After talking with the manager, and I mentioned he could make photocopies of the tickets, he then decided to make photocopies. Also, we weren't the only ones dining on the patio to have this problem. They were also giving a local discount, and my friend happened to be local, so we received an added bonus. The food is good and the wait staff are pleasant. I just wished they had told us everything before we arrived, but at least the manager did right, but we had to talk to him for 10 minutes. And if you sit on the patio you can hear/watch the Venetian performers perform."

While the food itself was not of the \"blow your mind\" variety, it definitely is a step up from your average chain restaurant.  I had the wine infused oxtail with herb papperdelle noodles, asparagus, and wild mushrooms.  Also present at dinner were a mushroom broccolini pizza and a Burata cheese ravioli.\n\nThe oxtail dish was good - hearty but not overly so and the wine sauce paired decently with the herbed pasta and the mushrooms. There was something missing to the dish though - each component by itself was tasty, but the dish in toto was only good, not outstanding.  Overall not so disappointing as to offend, but not so spectacular as to prevent some slight regrets for not ordering the ciopinno instead.  \n\nThe pizza stood much better as a whole experience, though the dough reminded me too much of pita and also too much of how delicious the crust at pizza delfina is in comparison. \n\nThe burrata (burata?  am I even remembering what the name of this cheese is?) ravioli was the crown jewel of the meal, IMO, mainly because of the cheese itself.  Smooth and buttery without holding too much liquid or falling apart, this cheese may be my new favorite, even compared to the uncomparable bufalo (if not simply because I love saying Bufalo :D).    There was a strong garlic flavor to the accompanying red sauce.  \n\nBoth the ravioli and the papperdelle were rather al dente, perhaps overly so for freshly made pasta, but still tasty enough for me to finish.\n\nI would come back for lunch if staying at the palazzo or ventian in the future."

The Olive tray was sinful -  almost as sinful as the bread bowl!  \n\nThe entrees were varied - and all 8 of our diners were thrilled with their choices - from Veal to sea bass and steak.  My sea bass fell apart when lightly touched - and was sweet and delicious!  \n\nA cheese plate (they added a few chocolates for fun) is always a favorite on the menu - a nice touch I think - and when asked to please rid it of blue cheese - they easily complied.

We've tried a few pizzas and those were good too (I think there was a duck one that I really liked).  The most recent visit we had a butter lettuce caesar salad that was delightful, a lobster club sandwich (lobster was a little hidden by the mayo and other flavors unfortunately) and the lasagna.

Ask for a knife though, otherwise you'll destroy the beautiful phyllo layers while you're trying to get a bite.  \n\nThe food here is better than average, but don't come expecting to be blown away.

The lunch menu offers such choices as pork wienerschnitzel, Hungarian goulash, and a lobster club sandwich, as well as pizza and pasta.\n\nLunch is served in the \"outdoor\" cafe portion of the restaurant.  It's open to the shopping area and trompe l'oeil sky.  The background noise level is generally not bad, but it gets a bit much when nearby performers start singing.\n\nI ordered pork wienerschnitzel, Austrian potato salad, and whole grain mustard sauce.  It was a thin but obscenely large piece of pork - about 7\" by 10\" - crisp and not greasy.  A lemon provided needed acidity, and the mustard sauce was mild but had good flavor.  All in all, a good combination.  On the other hand, the potato salad was bland.  I was pleased with my lunch, but it wasn't anything spectacular.  Perhaps I'll need to give it another try at dinner time."

But I'll never forget the doting service, delicious bread basket, attention to detail (wipe crumbs off the table and the waitstaff iron the tablecloths when it's changed) and that glorious chocolate souffle.  It's incredibly fluffy and soft texture kept my head in the clouds for a good part of my trip. It's at least a 30 minute wait for the souffle so place your order ahead of time."

But this is Vegas. And since this trip I only had 2 days, every meal counts. \n\nI ordered a sandwich (some sort of club) and the onion soup. The onion soup was sweet enough to be a dessert... imagine French onion soup without the saltiness nor cheese and throw on spoonfuls of sugar. Not very appetizing, right? The fries that came with my sandwich were also quite cold. I could literally see into the kitchen from my table. I saw my sandwich made, and it didn't take that long to come out. So why were my fries cold? They must have been from an old batch.\n\nAs far as service, it was decent. Friendly waiter, but not enough to save the whole restaurant. I sat inside (outside was a longer wait). The atmosphere outside (I say outside loosely...since it is in the middle of the Venetian) would probably have been a better experience. \n\nNot going to return, though, considering there were other restaurants in the same square."

For dinner, we had a choice of either seafood cioppino or a rib eye steak with pureed mashed potatoes and vegetables. The rib eye was tender, juicy and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were creamy, soft and fluffy and the veggies included a tasty assortment of asparagus, broccoli rabe and carrots. \n\nOur friends have great taste - everything was delicious!

When ordering, our waiter did mention that their tomato sauce was amazing...and it WAS good.  But, I found the meatballs to be too soft and semi-crumbly.  The white/veggie pizza was also ok, but a little bland.  The truffle potato chips were a win, though!  Very tasty and fresh!  \n\nThe big draw for this restaurant, though, is that you are eating \"outside\" in the Ventatian's replica of St. Mark's Square.  That in itself is probably the best part of this experience.  Since you're outside, you can people watch or take in one of the fun shows that are going on out there.  It's fun for all ages!  The service here is absolutely lovely and friendly, too.  Our waiter didn't smirk when my dad ordered a Reuben without the sauerkraut, rye bread and thousand island dressing.  That takes alot of skill right there."

First of all we wait forever just to get apps then have to hurry to eat them so they can put the main course down, Wolfgang would have had a fit if he saw that go down!! No apology's were made.\nNow I do have to say that the mussels where some of the best I have ever eaten but the clam linguine was extremely bland and the clams were so fishy tasting that I picked them out. I think they were suppose to offer fresh parmigian over our pasta which could have made a big difference. Shrimp pizza was just ok, you would expect it to blow you away! My daughter really enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs. The cesear salad had excellent flavor however I'm not a fan of the lettuce being whole leaf, I would rather they cut it up but this is just a personal preference so you decide. The asparagus soup was pretty tasty and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 was excellent along with the ice cream they serve with it however you need more ice cream. The ratio of cake to ice cream was waaaaay off! Also I was expecting very high quality drinks based not only on the price but the other review where the guy said the moscow mule was the best. I've been a bartender for years and these were just not up to my personal standard. The pineapple juice was not fresh nor was there fresh ginger in the moscow mule. Small effort to make a huge difference in a cocktail!\nAll in all I would not return to Postrio except maybe for the mussels and some water!!! The mussels were that good!!"

(in fact, I just realized I reviewed this meal back in June 2010.  Ha ha).\n\nThis Wolfgang Puck restaurant changes its menu every so often, so we haven't been able to recreate this meal since, but we haven't been disappointed.\n\nThis visit, we brought my brother, and we all shared several portions of the lobster sandwich, field greens, and short rib ravioli.  The lobster sandwich was amazing.  Would do this again.  The ravioli was a little salty, but as authentic and homecooked as you can get.  Like it really tastes like the short ribs were perfectly braised, separated from the bones, and stuffed into the pasted right before they brought it out...  \n\nOf course, we got the beignets.  Yummy donuts filled with chocolate, that literally explodes in your mouth.  Watch out.  Comes with coffee ice cream.  I love it.\n\nThe restaurant is located right in the center of the shopping area between the Venetian ad Palazzo, where there are intermittent shows and singing.  Really fun atmosphere to enjoy dinner."

Instead of sitting in the weird outside vibes area, we dined inside, where it was dark but quiet. We even had a little fireplace by us, and it was eerie to see the glow of the fake outside world through the doors.\n\nDespite service being a bit confusing at times (our main waiter was slow, and we had two other people asking us for our orders at different periods), things came out timely and well cooked. My boyfriend and I shared the creamy potato leek soup which was definitely creamy and not too potato-like, but still good when served with the crunchy bread. \n\nVegetarian fare was plain & simple - homemade pasta with a mushroom cream sauce. I'm used to this. Still a classic dish, and done great with some mini onions and a myriad of different mushrooms. It was definitely not salted enough so I asked my server, who was a bit taken aback, for a bit of salt. My boyfriend went nuts over the meatloaf & onion rings dish! I was happy about his excitement! :)\n\nThe dessert menu rocked!! I don't even know where to begin. I was so confused - definitely a huge hardship for the night. I chose the lemon pudding cake with blueberry compote & blueberry gelato, which was maybe my only mistake - a little too lemony/sweet, overpowering. I wish I had gotten the sweet potato pie!

This has made a world of difference (I was never impressed with the restaurant prior to this change). This was our second time coming back since it's been re-done, and while everything is very good, a few items particularly stood out.\n\nThe Korobuta pork schnitzel with Austrian potatoes and whole grain mustard sauce that my dad ordered was fantastic (my husband and I had it last time), and is one of Puck's personal comfort foods so worth trying. The pork is pounded thinly and lightly pan fried, and rests on a bed of lemon and herb dressed fingerling potatoes. It is also served with a cooling cucumber yogurt sauce and mini sald of teardrop tomatoes. There is nothing wrong with this dish at all, and I can't imagine it being any better in Puck's home country. There was nothing wrong with my husband's dish either, which unfortunately was only a special for the evening. This was a large portion of two perfectly roasted quail served on a bed of fluffy gnocchi and freshly shucked spring peas, bathed in a rich and intensely flavored reduction. This should become a permanet fixture on the menu because it really was amazing. My entree of steamed black mussels with white wine, garlic, grilled sourdough lavishly spread with bernaise was very good, but somewhat disappointing in comparison to the version at his restaurant, Spago, in Beverly Hills. At Spago the mussels were petite and sweet, making it unique from other versions of steamed mussels, and the bernaise was prepared with a bit more skill. It's hard for me to evaluate the mussels here without thinking of the mussels there, so while the comparison was fun, I'd order something else next time.\n\nThe appetizers we had were good but I wasn't nearly as impressed with those as I was with the entrees. We had the mesquite grilled steak skewers with creamy celery salad and house made steak sauce, and the charcuterie plate with grilled bread, artisan cheese, and marinated olives. The former was good but didn't taste terribly original (the little salad was the best part) and the latter was missing a sweet element and could have used some work on the presentation. I understood from a business perspective that they were trying to make it look like a huge portion, but I prefer something that looks a little less like a deli tray when I order charcuterie. \n\nI forgot to write down the prices, and they aren't showing up online (I hate when restaurants hide this), but I can assure you Postrio is pricey. My advice would be to skip on the apps (or at least those that we got), get an entree, and limit your drinks if you want to experience the restaurant without breaking the bank. Oh, and eat lots of bread - it's fantastic."

Their pizza dough has egg in it.\n\nOk, salad. ALL of their dressings except for one also has egg whites in them. That's odd, but whatever. So I get the chopped vegetable salad with the one dressing they can offer. The salad was mediocre and meager in portion size. So after lunch here I had to go find something to eat."

I didn't really have super high expectations and I definitely came with a bit of a jaded New Yorker's palate.\n\nThe food was good... nothing wrong with any of it.  Service was good, but not great (forgot to bring us bread, forgot orders of water) \n\nFour of us for lunch, ordered mixed greens, a pizza, burger, and fish.  Nothing was bad, everything was cooked right.  But it seemed a little sterile.  The food didn't \"jump\"... and for the prices, they should.  The pizza was a bit underdone for this NY pizza-style lover.  It's fine for most on the west coast when black means overdone, but not for me, completely blonde on top means underdone.   Mild leopard-spots on bottom, but no \"crispy-ness.\"\nThe fries were frozen (not fresh cut), and I highly suspect the dough for the pizza may have not been fresh made either.  Bun for the burger was also suspect.\n\nIf you're paying $19 for a burger and fries, everything better be freshly made if possible.  Another reviewer said \"best burger\"... unfortunately this is pretty far from the truth.  The meat is cooked spot-on... and the overall taste of the red onion marmalade and cheddar was nice... but it was well-beyond Vegas tax.  I could have a similar burger at Island Burger & Shakes in HK for half the price and the same deliciousness.  (Just no frozen tasting fries to pay for)\n\nI was prepared for a bit of \"Vegas tax\" and \"Puck tax\" but the food didn't quite justify the extra price for the burger.  It's a decent choice for other fare though.  Shoulda gotten up earlier to make it to Bouchon.  It's probably why there was a bigger line at Enoteca San Marco next door."

The first, we'd taken a red-eye to Vegas and had been up and walking around for 24 hours.- by the time we got to the bar we must've looked like hell, because one of the bartenders rolled right up with big glasses of ice water and told us, \"I'm setting you two up for success.\" Great! We slugged it down and he kept it coming while we sipped our pomegranate martinis - delicious,  nice and minty-tart - and talked Bruins with us.\n\nWe stopped for some apps a few days later, since it was there and we were once again pooped from walking around all day, We split a sausage trio (we dubbed it our Las Vegas sausage party) and a pizza with mushrooms, leeks, rosemary and goat cheese. The sausages were varied and prepared just right, with a great complementary set of mustards, and the pizza was savory and heavy on the goat cheese. (A cold slice the next morning was just as great!)\n\nFinally, my mom wanted a real meal here, after admiring the menu so many times over. She had the porcini mushroom ravioli, which I stole a nibble of; it was delicious, cooked just right, and the savory yet fluffy mushroom filling melded really well with the fresh parsley. I had the mesquite grilled salmon with fingerling taters and asparagus. The fish was cooked to a perfect moist medium-rare, and the vegetables in the creamy sauce were fresh and with fluffy-firm potatoes.\n\nWe were craving a little gelato - luckily there was a berry-rhubarb cobbler topped with honey gelato on the dessert menu. It arrived piping hot and was flavorful, the crumble full of whole oats and brown sugar and the gelato melting perfectly over the warm fruit. We wanted to sit and rest our poor abused feet after roaming the Mojave all day, so we stuck around and tossed back a few peach bellinis - just delicious.\n\nService was great, the bartenders skilled and just chatty enough, food was just delicious, and the people-watching is priceless. We kept coming back because every visit was better than the last; Postrio was a high note of our trip!"

The server was attentive, all I had to do was look at her and she came over. Drinks were never left empty, and silverware was replaced between courses. They even brought each dish out split onto two plates without us having to ask.\n\nThe crab cakes were light and fresh, and the creative mix of greens went well with them. The mushroom and leak pizza was good, a little on the salty/oily side but not overdone on the cheese, with a crispy yet light crust. The spring pea angolotti with pea shoots and maitake mushrooms was the highlight, the fresh peas were smoothly textured, the mushrooms added great flavor, great early summer meal. \n\nThe only downside that really stood out to me is the general atmosphere of the faux Italian piazza, but that affects all the restaurants in the area. The Venetian should really invest in improving the acoustics, it gets really loud and hard to hear the person across from you."

This year, however, I noticed their service has dropped off a cliff.  they didn't have our table at the time of our reservation, so we waited an extra 20 minutes.  The waiter was practically non-existent, and because we had seven people in our party, they applied an automatic gratuity of 18%, regardless of the poor service.  I can only assume that b/c the gratuity was guaranteed, they focused on smaller parties for which the tip isn't predetermined.  Anyway, I'm not going to risk taking customers to Postrio in the future, and would not recommend this restaurant....there are too many other good places to go..."

My party of four was seated in a booth in the main dining room after my party of four arrived five minutes before our 7:00 p.m. reservation and announced our presence.  After a few slices of good bread and butter, We began with a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and Spicy Tuna Tartare.  The Shrimp Cocktail was really unusual looking.  Six long and mostly straight shrimps lay on the plate, heads and all.  We cut off the heads, and then found that the cold shrimp meat was just as tasty dipped in a horseradish-based Cocktail Sauce as the more common curved variety.  These specimens were neither rubbery nor tough, and six of them was a generous serving.  The Tuna Tartare, with avocado, pickled ginger, cucumber, and crisp wontons, was just mildly spicy, moist, refreshingly cool, and delicious.\n\nNext was one of the best Margarita Pizzas I have ever eaten.  It was orange topped with six red tomato slices evenly spread  around the circumference, with Mozzarella Cheese nicely melted over each slice of tomato, fresh basil haphazardly resting in place, on a crust that was supple but perfectly baked.  The outer rim looked hard but wasn't.  Slices were juicy, finished with San Marzano Tomato Sauce.  Our appetizer pizza was dispatched quite quickly; it could have served as a nice entree.  Later, when walking out of the restaurant, I saw two more Margarita Pizzas that looked just like ours, so there appears to me consistency in food preparation.\n\nHome Style Chicken Soup was chock-full of cut vegetables and hunks of tender white chicken meat, and tasted great.  Caesar Salad was all good, with a spicy and creamy Caesar dressing, except a single anchovy was rather flat and pretty tasteless.  Clam Chowder with a few Parmesan crackers floating on top was a little rough: somewhat smokey and spicy in flavor, with undressed chunks of clams inside as if just plucked out of their shells.\n\nPancetta Wrapped Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy, resting on a bed of Yukon Gold Potato Puree, with three buttermilk-battered Onion Rings on top, was really dense but very tasty--great comfort food!  A side of buttered Buttered Brussels Sprouts was okay, while multi-hued Cauliflower was visually appealing and nicely cooked--not too hard and not too soft.  The heads were orange, green, white, and black.  \n\n A Banoffee--Banana & Toffee Cream Pie--made with House-Made Toffee and Banana Cream in a Sugar Dough Shell with a thick crust, was a unique, cool and refreshing dessert.  Banana lovers will really like this dish, that includes a small pitcher of Toffee Syrup to pour over the large slice of pie as much as one desires.  Iced Tea was good and tasty, and a non-alcoholic Mint Iced Tea was even more refreshing.  \n\nService was excellent except that I had to request one Iced Tea refill, and two serving spoons for the sides.  Diane was accommodated by a requested substitution of very good Roasted Potatoes for Austrian Potatoes, and Buerre Blanc for a Mustard-based sauce.  In fact, I was leaning toward an award of five stars until the day after we dined there, when I was contacted by Open Table via email that the restaurant had reported my party as a \"no show.\"  It was aggravating to have to prove that we were there after spending about $300 on dinner for four, but it was easy to do since our server had presented me with his card.  But the restaurant should perform better checking off of honored reservations than this, so 1/2 a star was lost for this irritating mistake.  But, overall, this was still a very enjoyable dining experience, and I plan to return soon to sample other intriguing offerings.\n\n4-1/2 stars on this initial outing!"

We are given the Cafe Menu.  I ask for the Tasting Menu and the waiter goes into this whole long song and dance about how there are two different menus and two different chefs and his chef will say no.  At this table with me is a waitress at another 4 star Vegas restaurant who totally joins me in making fun of this fool who just bascially told us we cant spend $100 a person here because we are seated on the other side of a halfwall and we can only spend a total of $100 for 3 people.  This weird waiter must work for some other reason then tips.  \r\nIn the end however, the food won out.  \r\nThe \"Liquid therapy\" menu hit the right spot with a \"Flirtini\" but not so much with the Mango Martini.

My experience with 3 or 4 cheese ravioli in a cream sauce is that the cheeses are muted.  Here however, the cheeses each came alive with each bite.  The sauce and the roasted pine nuts and chopped grape tomatoes were a perfect blend.  The pesto cream sauce needs to be finished, every last drop from your plate with the good bread.  \r\nIt's too good to leave a drop!\r\nThe couscous was light as air and the chicken fettucine was also mixed to combine but not overpower the natural tastes, so I was told.  \r\nSo it could have been the waiter that marred the experience but all in all, I would say it was very good but not as amazing as its San Francisco companion."

I'd rather have Corner Bakery's, especially at $6!\n\n3 people ordered the primer burger - 2 ordered theirs medium, 1 asked for medium well.  All of ours came out medium rare (bright red \"bleeding\" in the middle of our burger).  The medium people dealth with it and ate...but it was unacceptable for the person who ordered the med well (rightfully so!) - it took 10 min for them to take it back and then another 10 min for them to bring back the same burger that came out very charred on the outside.  \n\nGood for lunch, wouldn't go for dinner.  Expect to wait a LONG time to be seated and to get anything at your table."

WE had great seats outside with views of St. Marks square.  We had a round of appetizers consisting of the truffle chips, tuna tartare and crab cakes.  Sterling starters.  The entrees were beautifully prepared and because I am a meat-eater I stuck to the steak which is cooked Argentianian style, with chimichurri sauce.  Another hit.  I was full but there is always room for dessert and we indulged in the production and presentation heavy chocolate souffle.  Manna from dessert heaven.  I was happy, satiated and totally comfortable as I walked away from our table.  Kudos to the staff for making my experience unforgettable!"

I still crave the dish I ordered that day (slices of garlic cloves and slivers of parmesan tend to make quite an impression on one's taste buds even weeks after consumption), but I can't weigh my entire score on the food.\n\nThe hostess made me feel like a disgusting transient as she lurched me over to a table and told me to expect a waiter soon. The waiter and the rest of the staff were fine, but I still felt as though I was the disappointment among the clientele because I was only a party of one in a city crammed with dining couples.\n\nThe rustic \"artisan-style\" loaf fought off my hunger for a while, but the spicy Chilean red wine and pungent, hearty pasta arrived quickly. Still, I felt little love :-( \n\nLady Suzanne's hourly opera show, however, brought a tear to everyone's eye and added about two stars to my score. I'd have to say that my seat was perfect for watching this performance--as well as every other show that the Venetian hosts at the Grand Canal Shoppes. Few performers can pull off a Disney Princess persona and still retain my respect. She's bad@$$.\n\n...Yes, I consider her to be part of the dining experience. She sure saved THIS review, didn't she?\n\nIn closing, the food and the entertainment were the strong points at this establishment. Had the hostess shown me a slightly kinder shade of contempt, maybe I could have found the heart to add another star."

Not the outside cafe-style seating, not the wine - just the fine dining.\n\nSad.\n\nIt makes me sad that a place I'd enthusiastically give 5 stars to two years ago has fallen to 3-star status in my book.\n\nI liked this place enough that two years ago I've taken groups of 20+ people here twice, and been here numerous times since the first week of its opening (just like Aquaknox!).\n\nIt's not really so much the price - I do not feel that it is particularly more expensive than most other Vegas equivalents.  It's certainly more expensive than the other Wolfgang Puck establishments in Vegas until Cut came to the Palazzo, but it used to be well worth the money.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the menu deteriorated as time went on.  From the first few times where I eagerly tried many different house recommendations to my most recent visit last month - numerous favorites have either gone the ways of Houdini or had its quality drastically cut.\n\nI'll start with the seared John Dory.  John Dory isn't often served in restaurants, but this place had it seared to perfection.  It still remains in my memory as the most tender white flaky fish I ever had.  I wish I would have ordered it more the first few years, but I did not and I regret it.\n\nThen, the Peking Duck was a great dish as well.  Low in terms of quantity, but superb in quality.  Besides, that just saves you room for more appetizer and desert.  It's almost always sold out early on into the night.  Now, I think it's replaced by a Duck Breast entree, that just isn't nearly as tasty.  Sniff.\n\nThey used to serve (domestic) Kobe Beef here, ya know?  Kobe Beef is not my cup of tea, but everyone else loved it.  That's not there anymore either - tis a shame.\n\nBut no worries, because without the Kobe Beef - they still had a house special ribeye that was very delicious.  Actually, that's gone too.\n\nSo what *is* left that's still pretty good?\n\nScallops.  I can't remember if it's an appetizer or entree, but per my usual ways we order it like an appetizer.  I remember one time I was so crazy about their scallops I came here and ordered 6 orders.  I think I scallop-overdosed, but it was a very memorable experience and one I do not regret doing again.\n\n*Edit*\n\nI forgot about the chilled seafood platter they serve.  It's excellent - yeah, that's one reason I'd go back.  Phew, almost forgot about that!\n\nI don't think their pasta is bad, but there's plenty of better Pasta places in Vegas.  And by better - I mean, not even comparable better.\n\nYou know, based on my most recent experience I'd have given this place two stars based on how it stacks up versus all the other possible places you can eat at in Las Vegas.  But for the sake of what it used to be, and the possibility of what it can become again one day in the future - let's leave it at 3 stars."

It got my tongue and mouth tingling after just a couple of bites. Even though I do not like spicy foods, I ate every bite because it was so good. My stomach did pay the price a little later though. \n\nI was also able to steel a bite of my wife's burger, and I wish I could have stolen more.

We were served by the busser pretty quickly and took our drink order. \n\nWe looked at the menu and were puzzled... It was confusing as hell. To help, we looked on yelp on our phone. The waiter came by and was pretty helpful. We mentioned that we were locals and he told us we would get free desert because we were locals. Score!\n\nThey brought bread over which tasted pretty fresh. The busser brought over our drinks, I wanted an ice tea that was unsweetened but he upsold me to a mixed tea drink. He was unclear if it was unsweetened (which it wasnt) but I drank it anyway. \n\nWe ordered fried calamari as an appetizer. It was good, soft and not too tough nor chewy. I was surprised at the taste of the Thai sweet sauce compared to the marinara. I actually would prefer the Thai sauce now! I recommend this dish. \n\nI ordered the lobster ravioli and my wife ordered the cheese and bolgnese. We waited for a little bit but not as long as I thought it would take from the other yelpers. The portion size is pretty good, im a large eater and was pretty satisfied. I got about 6 large pieces of ravioli. (which came to my head... $30 dish = $5 per ravioli)My lobster was a bit on the salty side, but the sauce was mixed very well and completed the taste. Everything tasted very fresh. The ingredients, top quality food (compared to olive garden, macaroni grill etc) however it is pricey but we would come back once in a while. Not all the time, way too pricey. \n\nWe got our free desert, and it was delicious. Something we wouldn't pay for but very good. We got the little chocolate cake balls filled with Chocolate lava inside. \n\nAll in all, we loved the atmosphere. Very touristy since we are locals but it's a nice change of pace. We noticed the other customers were more of an upper class type but I'm just speaking on behalf of an average joe. I typically goto fine dining places once in a while but I would choose other places than here. They had a few free shows while we dined so that was a good time. I'd actually put 3.5 stars if I could. Only 3 because of the price."

            "review": "I'm reviewing Postrio after eating there two separate times.  If you are staying at the Venetian or at the Palazzo, this is an excellent option for fine dining.  My husband grew up in Germany, so he shares Wolfgang Puck's love and admiration for all things schnitzel, hence a return visit.  \n\nMost people were eating in the \"outside\" patio, where you can enjoy the beautiful faux Venice ambiance.  The lighting in this courtyard area is truly spectacular.  But, it is really loud and you are usually subject to some \"entertainment\" on the nearby stage, which has terrible sound.  So, we opted to eat inside the restaurant which was sleek and modern and quiet.  I much preferred this to the patio option, personally.\n\nOur server was prompt and knowledgeable; accomodating without condescention.  We were served several kinds of bread, including a remarkably light and flavorful foccacia. We started our meal sharing the apple salad which was, quite possibly, the best salad I have ever eaten.  The ingredients in the salad were all top-quality and the salad had a perfect balance of textures and flavors, featuring morsels of aged blue cheese and spiced marcona almonds.  The fennel was shaved thin and the apples were mandolined; both kept crisp in ice water until immediately before plating.  I highly recommend this salad as I have never had anything quite like it anywhere else.\n\nMy husband had the schnitzel, served with a warm mustard sauce.  The pork was pounded flat and the breading was uniformly crisp and not overly heavy.  It came with a very small amount of potatoes and roasted tomatoes, that appeared almost an after thought to the huge pork cutlet dominating the plate.  The waiter told us this is always on the menu as it reminds Wolfgang Puck of his Austrian upbringing and he does the dish proud.  I ordered the Cioppino, featuring shrimp, clams and fish.  It was good, not great.  The seafood had fresh flavor and firm texture and was not overcooked.  The broth was heavily scented from fennel and tomatoes.  I don't know Cioppino as a dish very well, but I would be surprised if this is as good as it gets.  \n\nAll in all, a good option for those visiting the Las Vegas strip.  It's pricey, but certainly not the most expensive option in a very high-dollar area.  And, the menu offers a variety for those looking for a break from the Italian and steakhouse options available elsewhere."

If you like the hustle and bustle and the energy of the canals, then outside is definitely for you. Tonight we kind of want a quieter dining atmosphere and chose to sit inside.\n\nWe were both wanting seafood and so we ordered:\n* Crispy Calamari with Zucchini and Olives, Spicy Tomato Sauce and Garlic Aioli - this was pretty good. better than your everyday calamari you might get at like a TGI Fridays, but not even close to Mesa Grill or B&B's version. it was worth it though to start.\n* Linguini with Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Chili and Parsley - this was my entree. it was ever so slightly above average. the clams were washed perfectly so there wasn't any grit but they were a little on the small side. overall the dish wasn't bad.\n* Seafood Ravioli, Clams, Mussels, Calamari, Shrimp, Bay Scallops, Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers - this was my gf entree... I grabbed a small quick bite. same story as above.\n\nWe had a few drinks with the meal and overall it was pretty good.  I will admit there really wasn't anything that was a WOW or substantially stood out in the meal, but everything was cooked perfectly and the food was good.

We ordered 3 pizzas, the wood oven roasted mushrooms/leeks/rosemary/goat cheese, house made pepperoni/kalamata olives/slow roasted tomatoes and the 'margheria' pizza. All were super big and very tasty. The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything and it was my older sister's birthday so after we ate they brought out this very gorgeous raspberry souffle with 3 different small bowls of sauce. The waiter then takes his spoon and breaks open the souffle and pours each one in as he explains what they are. WOW it was magnificant! I wouldn't usually order something that is raspberry but now I will definitely give it chance! It was $11 and he took it off the bill, very nice!

            "review": "My husband entered the Venetian mall after both of us crossed a river of rainwater and soaked our shoes and socks. We decided to eat at Postrio after a quick cross reference on Yelp!. We devoured the country white bread (perfectly crusty and tender) that was served with a flavorful tapenade. I ordered the mushroom tortollini in cream sauce and he ordered the lasagna. Both were heavenly and the portion size was perfect! The food was so good that we completely forgot about how miserable we were just half an hour earlier."

We had:\nCalamari - bland\nCauliflower  - beautiful, multicolored roasted cauliflower, gorgeous and tasty and well prepared\nApple salad - very good, great dressing, good portions, and they split it for us without us asking, when we said we would be sharing the appetizers\nMartinis - dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives\n\nThe bathroom is so dark, you need a flashlight or your phone light if you are going to try to redo your makeup or lipstick.\n\nOverall it was ok, but certainly not a great experience, and it feels weird eating in what is essentially a roped off area of a main lobby.  Eh, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

            "review": "Three stars does not befit how I felt about the food, rather the service.  I've eaten here twice, and both times service was sketchy.  I must clarify, however, that both times I ate in the cafe area, which is \"outside\" and not inside, which is where the fine dining is housed.  \n\nTo the important stuff, first the food:  I've been there with two separate parties, and we all really enjoyed the new american/mediterranean style food.  I always judge a restaurant by their french fries, so of course we started off with the pommes frites.  Perfectly seasoned, hot and crispy.  The aioli was a good accompaniment, but a tad on the rich side.  Besides, we still had loads full of starches to come.  Next we tried some of the flat bread pizzas.  Wolfgang Puck is famous for these, so you can't go to one of his places without trying these.  I love prosciutto, so the prosciutto with mission figs and blue cheese had to touch my taste buds.  I was pleasantly surprised by the crispiness of the crust despite the amount of toppings offered.  Also pleasantly surprising was how the blue cheese did not completely overwhelm the whole pizza.  My bf tried the spicy chorizo pizza, and he being a super carnivore, was very pleased.  \n\nWhen I went with my mother, we split the fettuccine with english peas and arugula and the linguine with clams.   Both pastas were divine.  Although I love classic Italian pastas, al dente, if you are strict about this, then please be aware that the pastas at Postrio are freshly made and not dry.  \n\nPortions here are very generous.  This is a welcome treat seeing as how every meal in Vegas can seem way too expensive, yet too small.  Hear that, Batali?  Now on to the bummerific:\n\nThe service is terrrible.  This is a blanket statement despite the fact that the food runners and bussers are very sweet.  Why, you ask?  The hostesses have a perpetual model scowl on their faces, I can never tell if the waiters are being sarcastic or if they really just need to be somewhere else, and the food takes foreeeeeever to come out.  I can deal with surly waiters (even if I still do tip 20%), and I can deal with a grumpy hostess, but I cannot starve while waiting for my food when there are only two other tables in the restaurant.  \n\nSo if you want to eat well, and can overlook the negatives, I suggest Postrio.  But if you're looking for atmosphere, look elsewhere."

            "review": "Located conveniently (and beautifully) in the fabulous Venetian, where my two friends and I stayed, we decided to come here for my friend's birthday lunch. It was very typical food on the menu--salads, hamburgers, pasta, etc. I ordered a chinese chicken salad and ate about half of it. Maybe it was because I wasn't in the mood to eat, but it just didn't do it for me. Not sweet enough and just pretty mediocre. The atmosphere is gorgeous though, inside the Grand Canal Shoppes. I would likely not go back because of the food, but the location, speed of service and atmosphere makes up for it (almost)."

            "review": "So incredibly pricey! For the price...not sure if it's worth it. Waiter was good and we were seated so that we could look at all the people shopping outside. Our order:\n\nCalamari: Gluten free whaaaaat? But yes, it is! Not super crispy, but definitely nice flavor though slightly bland. Sweet and sour sauce instead of traditional cocktail/marinara. Not bad.\n\nCaesar salad: Very fresh and crispy. For the price of $13 though? It really was a slab of romaine lettuce with dressing...\n\nRoasted chicken with BBQ sauce pizza: Bf did not like this at all. Sauce was lacking and chicken was dry. Pizza crust was dense, yet tried to be a thin crust...not crispy. Honestly, the flavor just tasted off to me.\n\nKurobuta pork schnitzel: Um, it was a dry pork cutlet mashed thin and fried. The whole grain mustard sauce was good, but $27 for a pork cutlet is just not acceptable. Do not get this! Looks plain and tastes like it too! My friend did not even bother to finish it and ate her bf's food instead.\n\nFree range chicken: Half a chicken over very smooth, slightly buttery potato puree. Veggies (brussel sprouts) were pretty good. the chicken was well seasoned and the natural au jus was flavorful as well, however some of the chicken was still dry. It is difficult to make moist chicken breast though, so I can't complain too much. \n\nOverall, for the price we are paying, I expected more. I'll come here if my friend wants to go again, but I probably would not come here on my own, especially considering that Venetian offers so many wonderful restaurants."

There was no real flavor besides the egg, the potatoes were bland, and the price was like double what the tastes were worth.  That is to say, a typical Vegas price for rather mediocre food.\n\nI have to say the ambiance is pretty great, but I would put that on the Venetian rather than the restaurant itself.  I admit I would probably hate those performances if I worked here, though."

BUT his diluting attention is obvious at each of his restaurants.\n\nWe went there since we had 20% off. The service was nice but so fucking lazy. It took forever to get anything and the staff was so forgetful. I ordered tea with milk and sugar. I got the tea, had to ask for the milk twice and then kept getting false promises that the sugar was on its way. After 15 minutes I got it. It wasn't crowded and the staff was just hanging out.\n\nThe Caesar salad was decent, served with the leaves whole but the dressing was so mild and scant. I will admit that my gf's lasagna was delicious but my pancetta wrapped meatloaf was dry and lacked pancetta."

We were lazy to leave the Venetian we were staying at so we decided to walk around the shops and find something to our liking... Obviously we chose Postrio! \n\nTheir menu was divided into brunch, small plate, medium plate, and large plate options. I think everyone in our party chose something from the brunch section! Our waiter gave us fantastic service, I wish I remembered his name! I love that he always served the ladies first and tried to make pleasant conversation with us whenever he came to check up on the table. We also each got a complimentary mimosa with our entrees! Yummy ;D\n\nEveryone was happy with their food :) The favorites were the eggs benedicts which you could get with either traditional canadian bacon, smoked salmon, lobster, or vegetarian. Mmm I got the lobster benedict and it was amaaazing with huge chunks of lobster. They definitely did not skimp out on me!\n\nGreat atmosphere, great company, great food = couldn't be happier!!"

The young maitre 'd was sullen and humorless (I assume she was the obligatory aspiring actress/model/weather girl) and felt that a smile was simply too much for her soon=to-be-famous face. \n\nOnce our brush with imminenet celebrity was done the rest of the dinner was outstanding. Our waitress, and indeed everyone who hovered around, delivered to  or checked on our table was warm and friendly and totally professional. \n\nThe experience of dining under the faux stars of the Venetian Piazza was wonderful and greatly enhanced by the string quartet playing to our right. \n\nBut the highlight of the evening was of course the food. As I have said before I am not a foodie, but both our meals were remarkably good. I had the mushroom risotto and my girlfriend had the schnitzel and both fell squarely into the category of best meal I've ever eaten. Risotto can get a bit monotonous but this meal so so wonderfully prepared each mouthful was an intriguing blend of interesting spices. The schnitzel itself was a tad bland until you applied the sauce which complemented the meat so perfectly that it was transformed into an entirely different dish.\n\nIf you are heading to Vegas and are thinking about a casual romantic dinner at a great restaurant (for a surprisingly reasonable cost I might add) it would be hard to do better than Postrio"
