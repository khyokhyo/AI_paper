Sushi was okay but for the price I would have rather ate somewhere else. \n\nThey have no customer service. Basically we ordered and they delivered our food. No one checked to see how we were doing or to even refill our drinks except for the 3 waters at the table. We only ordered a couple rolls & were going to order more if someone ever came back to take our order...they didn't...I also ordered sea weed salad when they had first brought our food to us... That never came. \n\nGo to another sushi restaurant in town. You'll get your food faster and will have better service."

The lady didn't set our table and forgot an extra pair of utensils for me, and when clearing the plates she spilled soy sauce on my boyfriend's shorts, and when we were done, we had to walk up to pay since she never checked up on us.\n\nPros:\n-delicious sushi\n-great selection of special rolls\n-the las vegas roll is a must try\n-the happy hours are amazing\n-pretty interior and clean design\n-food came out fast and fresh\n\nCons:\n-poor customer service\n\nOverall: I'll definitely eat here again if I am craving sushi in Vegas :) Hopefully the next time I visit, their customer service will be better."

(Surprised there is no review from anybody about these, I always get two when I go, everytime and the slaw it's served on is to die for too)\n- I had a Lobster roll topped with Mango (I believe it was 9.50) which was one of the best rolls I've had.\n- Chicken Yakatori (Yummmmm!!)\n- Pork Goyza (Yummm!!)\n\nThe Sea Monkey is a pretty good drink too.\n(My only complaint is that the Blue Fin drink listed on the website http://www.rasushi.com/\nIs not on the menu in the Las Vegas location and it's not like I'm not gonna remember what's in it so they can make it for me!)\n\nGo on SIN Sunday!! Totally save you a ton of money and the prices aren't bad considering it's on the strip.\n\nThis place is up there with Tiger Sushi (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tiger-sushi-las-vegas #1 in town!) and Ichiza."

Not so much anymore. \n\nMy friend and I were in the area and decided on this spot to meet up for drinks. We walked in, waited about 5 mins for a table and sat down. TWENTY minutes pass and still no service. My friend finally got up to the hostess to ask where out server was. The only saving grace of this place was our server. I completely forgot her name but she was so bubbly and nice. Not the fake nice, but the genuine nice. \n\nAnyway, prices for HH went up about 75 cents. Food quality went downhill with smaller portions. I ordered this one frozen lemonade Bellini concoction and it was awful. Only reason I drank it was because I didn't want to waste alcohol. \n\nAnyway, I had a good time with my friend but I don't think I'll be returning here nor would I recommend anyone to this place ever!!"

A couple more dollars and you can get the chilled flavored sakes (melon)  It use to be a hiphop crowd on sunday nites. There's still a DJ, but more like a video DJ. I miss having the actual DJ and  his music. The last time I was there it was mostly a lot of rap videos. \n\nThey've added more to their reverse happy hour list, which is so much better.  A great place to get a group of friends to chill and drink. Mix crowd on sundays, but more on the younger crowd. Not no family and kids place. Can't wait to round up some friends and hopefully go back."

Then stumble out of the restaurant hilariously. Unlike a lot other Yelpers, I didn't find their food that great. I think RA uses dim red lighting and Britney Spears remixes as a distraction for their food. \n\nWait time was unnecessarily long. One of the hostess was clad in sweat pants and tee. I'm all for casual, but girl was straight up homebody status, foreals. Their lobster roll was laced with lots of lettuce leaves. Lobster was almost non-existent. Chicken wings were meh. Overall, the food was alright but it was overpriced. Beer and cocktails were fine. Food service was fine and efficient.  I tell you what, there are better places to get your sushi in Vegas. Like Sushi-Mon, Sushi Wa, Spicy Tuna, or Shuseki (Chinatown)."

More creative rolls and sushi than I have seen in a long time. Super tasty. I got a spicy chirashi bowl too which nailed it. We drowned ourselves in sake and beer. So much so that we all just about had our own bottle to hit the strip with. \n\nAnd the best part...The meal cost us $32 each. We were more than full and plenty liquored up by the end. No group of 17 dudes can get out of a meal for that type of price. Especially raw fish!\n\nDive in."

Some bald head guy that thought he was bad ass. He walked away while I was trying to give a order, and he also passed by us like we weren't even there. This guy was the worst server I've ever had.

If I was writing about the Arizona locations, I probably would have rated it a three-star, if that, but this location situated on the plaza at the Fashion Show Mall has always been a favorite of mine.\n\nThe lunch Bento boxes are a bargain -- good on quality, great on quantity. What really wowed me was the Dengaku Tofu - Crispy like tempura but not greasy fried tofu served with tempura sauce with a red miso ginger glaze. Absolutely delicious! The Hamachi nigiri was very good, but if you want sushi, there are better places.\n\nService was pleasant and attentive. The only negative -- sitting on the outside patio listening to competing music with the restaurant next door as well as the ambiant noise from the center itself and Las Vegas Boulevard."

The downsides are that they made us wait outside for our group of  8 and when we went inside it was completely empty so they didn't need to make us wait. \n\nThe up sides are that the food is pretty tasty. I like that each peice of a roll would easily fit in your mouth. The catch is that you have to order more food to feel satisfied. \n\nThe tempura fried ice cream was yummy. I would eat here again."

In fact I don't really remember the names of the rolls we had!  I have had worse, but I have also had much better.  Sushi-wise,\n\nThis is more like a bar that serves sushi and not necessarily a sushi restaurant in the strictest sense.  We had lunch there, but you could tell at night this place turns into some swank club at nighttime.\n\nI have been told this was the place to be during happy hour due to their drink specials and super cheap rolls.  I would venture to come back during a happy hour and give it another try."

I think Ra has more Amercanized sushi than Japanese sushi since I come from a place with lots of authentic sushi restaurants. Most of the sushi on the menu doesn't contain raw fish, which is surprising since its called \"Ra.\" My sister ordered the \"Ra\" llipop roll and I got the crunchy shrimp tempura roll. She did not like the roll, but my crunchy shrimp was fine. I have to say that their beef teriyaki bento box was really good. The meat had a really good sauce. They also had good service, which always makes things better."

Their portions were so small, and the ambiance was pretty cool... a little too Americanized cool for my taste though. I am the type of person that doesn't go out much for sushi because my dad makes it at home at a much better quality and freshness. So for me to go to a sushi bar means either (1) I am REALLY craving sushi, (2) other people around me are craving it, or (3) the ambiance is really hot. \n\nWell... I think 2 out of 3 apply in this case, however I can't say the sushi was by any means high quality. The rice wasn't made well and it is just about a little better than your typical buffett made sushi. \n\nWell... since the happy hour prices were awesome, I can't complain much (the party of 8 frat boy gringos next to my table certainly seemed to love their \"cultured\" sushi experience)\n\nokay... let me break it down my take on the restaurant....\n\nSushi Quality: 2 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars, if you are looking for a posh thing. But if you want traditional, 2 stars is more like it. \nService: 3 stars\nPrice: 4 stars (you get what you pay for)\nAuthenticity: 2 stars (only because they had asian looking ppl making sushi and we got chopsticks)\n\nTotal grade: 2.83 stars."

He was at a level at which I thought he was new, but it didn't seem like he was shadowing or that anyone was helping, so perhaps not.\n\nI considered giving them a 3 star based on the food and reasonable prices during happy hour, but you can find such better service on the Strip.  They would have earned it with a different server, no doubt!\n\nOne shining moment from our visit  - Try the Emperor's Cucumberita -  yum!"

It's always buffets.\n\nHowever, figuring it was a Friday night and July 4th, we thought it would be best to eat at a restaurant instead of facing the long buffet dinner lines.\n\nI chose this place because the Yelp reviews said it was decently priced with decent food and it was close to our hotel.\n\nWe sat down with about 20 minutes left before the end of Happy Hour so my brother and I ordered 5 items - 4 food items and 1 huge Tsunami punch (which I neglected to read from the reviews that it is a drink to share).\n\nHighlights-\n-The drink was yummy. My mom liked it a lot. I think she drank more than I did!\n-I ordered my usual soft shell crab which they cooked with a harder-than-I-am-used-to batter and covered it with sesame seeds - it took away from the flavor the crab. \n-I did not like the texture of the agedashi tofu. \n-Nice selection on the sashimi combo - I ate my dad's tako sashimi. Yum! Chewy without giving my jaw too much of a workout. \n-The rolls we ordered were only okay. I did not taste all the flavors I remembered reading on the menu when I ordered them.\n\nI would go back just for Happy Hour or their Late Night Menu."

First of they took forever to come and get my order, so I finally ordered- the server deliver my food and only to find out my other food was not available after waiting for a long time. Why did she not ask me if I wanted to pick another one from the menu. She never came back to ask me if everything's ok and not even refill my water. So finally Im done eating they gave me the check again Im sitting there forever just waiting for my server to get my check I tried to get the other server attention but they keep ignoring me. The place was not busy and theres a lot of employees standing around but refuse to make eye contact with me because its not theyre table and my server I can see her from my table she was just hanging in the back by the register. So I have to stand up and approach a server which try to pretend he cant see me so I have to come to him right in his face so I can pay my check. It was such an awful experience that I will never recommend this place to anyone."

The appetizer I ordered was very delicious Edamame beans in a divine spicy soy sauce with fresh garlic. As a main, I got the Viva Las Vegas Roll, which blew my mind as an explosion of different flavors, and different textures threw all together, creating one hell of a sushi meal. Our server, Britney, was very insightful and empathic, she brought us the food in time and refilled the drinks, always with a smile. The experience was underlined by the loud technopop playing in the separated area where I sat outside. I would definitely recommend this as a place to go out for your next trip to Sin City."

We chose RA since it was pretty central to all sides of town and they had happy hour specials until 7 pm. The service was decent, no problems there and I liked that the happy hour wasn't restricted to just the bar area, but the food was just super average.\n\nWe ended up sharing some edamame, just salted and cooked the same way you could prepare it at home. I also had the seaweed salad and crispy calamari roll. Nothing stood out to me and it all just tasted like any other standard sushi restaurant. \n\nIt's a beautifully decorated place with a central locations and decent pricing, but don't expect to be blown away by their sushi."

We stumbled upon RA and we were pretty excited since we'd been eating Earl's, pizza and Chipotle all weekend. (Yes! Finally a sit-down meal with healthier food so we don't feel like whales.)\n\nThey have a really extensive menu and we were pretty surprised to see that everything was reasonably priced. I ordered the Dinner Sashimi Assortment which had four pieces of tuna, salmon, yellowtail and whitefish; served with a bowl of rice and Miso soup. It was under 20 dollars which is definitely worth it. \n\nHowever, one of the pieces of whitefish had a small bone in it which took me by surprise. You don't expect to bite on something hard when eating something with melt-in-yo-mouth texture. I wasn't going to say anything about it but later on in the meal, I discovered two much bigger bones, one in a yellowtail and another in the whitefish. I eat sushi a lot and have never encountered bones in my sashimi before.\n\n2 stars because management was nice enough to discount my meal."

Ra seemed promising...it was full of people, dimly lit, bumpin top 40 tunes. I was by myself and requested to sit at the sushi bar. I figured that it would surely be faster to sit at the bar then a table...boy was I wrong. \n\nWhen I gave the sushi chef my menu of selections, he informed me that it would be at least 30 minutes before I got my first order. What?!?! Yes, the place was kind of busy, but not packed, and there were at least 4 sushi chefs behind the counter.\n\nSo I figured that I would order some miso soup and vegetable tempura appetizer to kill some time. The soup was good, kind of hard to screw that up. The tempura on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. They gave me about 10 pieces, 8 of which were asparagus and broccoli. Come on! I want some sweet potato, regular potato, green beans....anything but a plate of broccoli! Broccoli never tempura's well because the batter gets in the crevices and never really cooks, but stays raw. Utterly disgusting. The tempura dipping sauce had absolutely no flavor at all and added nothing to the flavor of the dish. \n\nAbout 30-minutes later and on cue, my sushi began to filter in. First I was given my rainbow roll. The diameter of this roll was a little larger than the size of a quarter. It was cut into 8 pieces and consumed in about 20 seconds. Next, I was given my tuna. The tuna was mushy and the rice fell apart on almost every piece. I am no sushi virgin and know full well how to use chop sticks...this rice was horrible. 10 minutes later I was given my yellowtail. Again, it was mushy and the rice fell apart. Some time later my salmon arrived and it was the same story. I had to ask for ginger and wasabi, as they were not just provided to me. \n\nI saw my server maybe twice and not only did my glass of water sit empty for nearly 20 minutes at a time, but my plates began to stack up next to me. \n\nThe sushi chef wouldn't even give patrons the time of day and seemed as though we were bugging him every time we wished to place an order. Look, at nearly $6.00  for two pieces of tuna sushi, the food better be pristine! And the service impeccable! \n\nThe menu comes with a disclaimer that good sushi takes a while to prepare, so if you can't wait, then you basically should leave. Um, no. Good sushi does not take 30-minutes to prepare. Sushi was designed to be Japanese fast food, analogous to the western European sandwich. If you are going to pose as a sushi elitist restaurant, then at least go all the way. I expect to not have wooden chop sticks that splinter and I would like my sushi to be served in the correct order, from light fish to dark. \n\nAll in all, the service sucked and the food was blah. I'm done with this rant. That's how much I hate this place. If no star was an option, I would have picked that!"

It was good though.\nThe meat-eater liked his dishes okay (which included eel sashimi, calamari roll)\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very nice and sweet.

Pretty good for sushi!\nLOCATION: Within the Fashion Show Mall (UFO looking complex) across from the Wynn on the 1st floor level.\nCONCLUSION: I don't think it's worth it if it's not happy hour but good deal for okay sushi at happy hour times.

Pretty cool.\n-The Ra'chin Shrimp (appetizer shrimp) that is available during the happy hour is really good.  The sauce doesn't really complement the dish, but the shrimp are nice without it.\n-The Viva Las Vegas Roll and the seared tuna are really good.  They are more of a fusion but it totally works.  I order them each time I am there.\n\nThe consistent:\n-The servers have bigger attitudes than any other restaurant I have ever been to, consistently.  Once you understand that they aren't being personally rude, that they're just being kind of vapid because they don't care.... Last week my boyfriend sent back chicken wings because they tasted \"off\" (he did have indigestion later), our server said, \"Well, I always liked them,\" and walked away.  She took them off the check and the table, but she was kind of a dismissive jerk about it.  We have come to just expect that from the service, like you're inconveniencing them by being there.\n-The music is so so loud.  The bar portion of RA is fun, yes, but when you are over in the table portion, you don't want to hear the pounding music over your conversation.  This consistency is why I avoid being there after 9pm.\n\nThe bad: \n-My luck must be placing me in the women's room when there is either a line or no toilet paper.  It's always one or the other, especially when one of the two stalls was out of commission.\n-They pride themselves on a great sake list but they often have 86'ed whichever I am ordering.  Boo.  I guess I should have placed that in consistencies as well.\n-Happy hour for drinks is good.  But I was shocked to see how skinny the rolls because during happy hour.  It was almost comical.  I won't be going to dine there again under the guise of a deal.\n\nAll and all, if you don't mind dismissive service but need to get something without the drama of heading into the heart of the Strip, it's good, but don't go in with high high hopes."

            "review": "Ra Sushi is located in the Fashion Show mall allowing patrons to practically dine right on the famed Las Vegas Strip.\nUpon entering Ra Sushi, we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess whom quickly gave us a view and summary of our seating options, a more formal area in the back, casual up front, the full bar with televisions, the sushi bar, or at a high top counter that runs the length of the restaurant facing Las Vegas Blvd.\nMy wife ordered their Blushing Geisha for $8 I Samurai Cowboy,also $8.\nRa Sushi offered up the usual sushi fare, Nigiri, Sashimi, Maki and speciality rolls ranging in price from $2 for QUAIL EGG \"UZURA\", to $17 for a King Crab Roll. Interested in trying their sushi, and interested in the quality of food with such reasonably priced dining on the strip, I decided to order one of their lunch specials which run from 11 am - 3 pm daily. The BARA CHIRASHI BOWL for $10.75 is served with miso soup & uchi no salad tuna. The soup was served first, the scallions still retained some of their crunch and the soy was firm, which led me to believe the soup was made fresh for me today. The uchi no salad never made it to the table, but sitting at the floor to ceiling opening on the strip located directly across from Wynn Resort & Casino, provided me with so much to see, that I honestly forgot it was a part of my meal and though missing, I never asked. The Bara Chirashi Bowl was large and plentiful containing salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, avocado & cucumber with Asian green vegetables, mixed with poki sauce; served over rice. Chilled, filling, no shortage of sushi, I will definitely order again.\nMy wife ordered an UCHI NO SALAD for $5 containing mixed greens tossed in a soy ginger vinaigrette which arrived with my soup. The salad was a good portion yet not overwhelming so. The greens were fresh, and the ingredients in the vinaigrette complimented each other nicely. She also ordered an appetizer as an entr\u00e9e. The LOBSTER SPRING ROLLS for $11.75 contained lobster mixed with mango, cream cheese & mild peppers, wrapped in wonton paper & lightly fried; served with a mango sauce. Unfortunately, after the salad and soup were cleared, my lunch bowl arrived, and my wife's lobster rolls had not. We assumed, that for some reason, the server was making two trips, but they were not. We did not wait long before the waitress checked in, surprised and apologetic with regards to our missing food, she promised to have it out right away. The Lobster Spring Rolls did make it to our table fairly quickly. The rolls were delicious. And though we were friendly, and beyond asking for our food, truly did not complain at all, our waitress informed us that her manager did not charge us for the lobster and asked if there were anything else she could do for us.\nLunch for two adults looking over the Las Vegas Strip, on the strip, including soup, salad, two fun cocktails, and just a little confusion mixed in with friendly fast service cost us just $40 including tip. The confusion saved us $12.\nThe Las Vegas Strip contains many, many places to eat, and it runs 4 miles long. That being said, if you find yourself at the Fashion Show mall, or any where close by, Ra Sushi is a wonderful, affordable place to eat, and I will definitely be dining there again."

It's a mix of regular Japanese rolls and some Asian Fusion appetizers/side dishes. It was the best decision ever! So good, in fact, that we decided to go there twice in our three day stay in Vegas. Located right on The Strip at the Fashion Show Mall, it was so easy to find. The greatest thing about this place was its happy hour is from 3-7pm, perfect for dinner time. From $2 side dishes, to $4 regular rolls and $7 dollar special rolls, $30 was enough to fill our tummies with delicious yummy-ness. I also personally loved the atmosphere, its red lights and tasteful decorations plus top 40 music playing in the background, complements the Vegas style perfectly. I just can't express enough how awesome this place was, when I go back with my friends in the summer, I am definitely bringing them there!!\n\nSome must tries at this restaurant are: shishito peppers, Viva Las Vegas Roll, spicy tuna roll, garlic sugar snow pea, tootsi roll, and scallop dynamite, 5/6 of them were on the wonderful happy hour menu!"

The place was dimly lit and reminded me of a trendy sushi place we have in Fresno, CA. Since we came during the last hour of business, the service was great and the food came out promptly. There was a fairly big party there as well, but seemed like everybody's orders were unaffected by them. \n\nIf I remembered correctly, our bill came out to about $70 - average price of sushi for a couple with big appetites.

We asked for them to omit some spicy tuna from one of their specialty rolls and he gave us so much attitude about it we almost left.\n\nI was back in town again this week and gave RA another try for dinner with a group of 5.  First  of all, it is WAY too loud in there.  The music is turned up so high, we had to scream at each other just to have a conversation.  As soon as we sat down, they turned the lights down so low we could not read the menus.  Luckily, we are A/V techs working in town and we all had our flashlights handy.   You would think seeing a table full of flashlights would clue them in to turn the lights up again, but no such luck.\n\nWe had already been waiting quite a while when our waitress came and asked us if we would mind waiting some more so she could finish with another table.  When she finally got our table going, our beers were served warm (it was 110 degrees outside) and we had to ask for glasses for them.  When she took the food order, she couldn't hear one end of the table. After shouting back and forth with bad results, we had to suggest she come around to the other end of the table so she could hear us better.  The worst part came when the entire group had been served, except for one of us.  When we inquired about this she said - and this is verbatim - 'If we waited to bring it out until it was all ready, the fish would go bad'.  We also received our appetizer AFTER we had finished our meal, with no apology or explanation. \n\nIf the food was amazing I would say putting up with all this was tolerable, but it just isn't.  The servings are skimpy and there is more rice than anything else in most rolls.  Their specialty rolls are not even served with wasabi or ginger.  The failed mexi-japanese fusion menu is more flash than fish.  \n\nI sincerely hope the owners and management have more experience expediting a kitchen than our experience indicated, or that the waitress seemed to be aware of.  I've never heard such a ridiculous excuse for guests not being served at the same time.  Never, ever again."

Even their California Rolls are deelish. (I only know this from eating off of my friends' plates). Some of the best dishes they have aren't sushi at all. The Tuna Salad is bomb.com. Tuna Sashimi on a bed of greens and an awesome sweet/spicy dressing. I am sure the menu describes it better, but just eat it and be amazed. I recently tried the Lobster Spring Rolls. The roll is crispy and flaky and the lobster is always perfectly prepared. It comes atop what I think is a mango puree AKA mango baby food, but the mix of the lobster, cream cheese and super sweet puree makes for a party on the tongue. A couple tips, Fashion Show Mall employees receive a discount (I think 10% off total not including alcohol) and if you check in on Foursquare and tell your server, you get a free order of edamame or a bowl of miso soup. I also like that the entire staff is aware of their Foursquare specials and don't act jerky when you ask for free things."

She is awesome.

I had a Lagunitas Little Sumpin' for $5.50, which was definitely unexpected.  The two rolls I had were the Spicy Lobster Roll and the Zonie Roll.

The shrimp comes in a generous portion, crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside. The dipping sauce is pure liquid crack. It goes well with everything.

When we first walked in I was thrown by the loud music but soon they began playing more familiar toons. Somehow when the music is familiar it doesn't seem so loud. \n\nWe started with edamame which was pretty good. It was steamed just right and not soggy plus they used those nice flakes of salt. Next came the miso soup and again yummy. Unfortunately from there the meal was just so so. I had the shrimp tempura bento box, and he had the chicken teriyaki bowl. We shared the ultimate shrimp roll. The food honestly was just bland.  Those who know me will be amazed to hear me say that as I tend to like blander foods.  The sushi roll was nothing spectacular and really not rolled very well. The shrimp and bento box was just so so and I was disappointed that they had no sweet n sour or duck sauce. Even acted like I was daft for asking for it. Those who joined us got a couple of rolls and felt it was so so too. They got the spicy salmon roll and asked for a new one as there was no spice taste at all. \n\nThe service was so so. It wasn't terribly so there was no reason they didn't check on us a bit more.

Honestly, now that I'm typing it out I'm not surprised that our bill came out to $83 LOL.

The rice was hard on some dishes and on the crunchy tuna dish, the rice was actually so hard I hurt my tooth biting into it. The dishes that are supposed to be spicy, aren't. The drinks were okay - a little too strong for me. Again, you'll get better quality at Kona Grill.\n\nMy BIGGEST pet peeve was the waitress. She was attentive but right off the bat said that she had no idea what was on the menu and \"didn't know much.\" Now, if you're new or the restaurant just changed the menu I get it, but fake it til you make it honey. Or at the very least apologize and explain - don't just make yourself seem clueless. Again, she was attentive and checked on us a few times but the second thing I disliked is she brought the bill out before we asked for it and that made us feel rushed. It's a personal pet-peeve, I know, but I feel like I'm being asked to hurry up and there were PLENTY of open tables. Finally, what set me off was that she circled the tip area for us as, what?, a reminder to tip her? Don't do that. Please don't do that LOL. I will tip what I feel is appropriate but for her to circle the 20% tip area is like her telling me what I need to tip and that's just bad service.\n\nI think it's safe to say I won't be coming back."

Came here during happy hour with my best friend and her mom who is Korean and is very picky about her sushi. We had the gyoza, spicy chicken wings, edemame, the Viva Las Vegas roll and more i just don't remember cause I was already drunk and then we ordered large beers with hot sake. I was DONE-ZO. I love RA and this particular location is one of the best next to downtown San Diego. I will keep coming back to you RA. Muah."

            "review": "Let me tell you about my experience here tonight. My family of 5 came to RA sushi for dinner after hearing good reviews about this place. We arrived at 10:05 PM tonight and were seated. Then, we saw that happy hour was from 10PM onwards on the weekdays. We ordered a Rainbow Roll from the HH menu (8.99 instead of 11.95), and two other rolls from the regular menu.\n\nWe were served by ROB. At first he seemed Ok. We were honestly just making small talk and joking with him throughout. Our order took 30 mins to arrive, which was fine despite it being a slow night with little customers. Sushi was ok as well; it was on the salty side. \n\nWhen the bill came out, we were charged full price for the Rainbow Roll. We placed our credit card to pay; and asked a woman (bartender?) working there to let our waiter know to adjust our rainbow roll to the HH price.\n\nHe came out with the bill having charged us 11.95. No questions asked. I came up to talk to him, let him know the situation. I asked him why he charged us full price when it was HH? He responded, \"I don't know why you're doubting/questioning me *insert him scoffing*. I can't do anything about it now.  I can get my manager but it'll take a while cus he's busy.\" I'm 1000% sure it was HH when I arrived because I SPECIFICALLY looked at the HH menu, and then at my watch to show 10:05 before exclaiming to my cousin that it is HH. I then challenged him if there were security cameras so we can check the time stamp. I was fuming at the point because 1. No ownership of your mistakes 2. No empathy or even care that your customer is upset/ don't even bother to have DIALOGUE to discuss problem, just point fingers as if I'm wrong. And then just charging us the full price instead of honoring your HH. \n\nI need to make a disclaimer here: I am someone who believes is tipping and I will almost ALWAYS leave 20% regardless of how the food turns out, IF there is ANY customer service. ROB is incredible in that he DGAF.\n\nIt's upsetting that a place as fancy and nice as this sushi restaurant lacks so much in their customer service. What a bummer to this Vegas trip. Maybe it was a bad night, but I wouldn't take my chances here with the long wait, salty sushi, and price overcharge/shadiness in NOT HONORING YOUR HH."

It's a very cool environment inside, the restrooms are cool but a little dark inside, and the little round lamps make it very aesthetically pleasing. The service is pretty quick and not the kind of bothersome service. It's a sign of attentiveness and great service in my book!\n\nThe Happy Hour menu-- 3/5\n3 stars for what it is! It's good but not super memorable. It's the kind of food that you eat to sustain life but with a hint to enjoy it's texture. I will mention that the Las Vegas Roll is very good! The calamari is really good as well. The others are just semi-noteworthy and I'll let you be the judge of them :)\n\nService/Waiting-- 3/5\nThere is hardly a wait for happy hour which is always a plus! You can basically walk off the street and ask the hostess for a table. Ask for the patio if the weather is fair and enjoy people watching coming from the Wynn of shopping at the Fashion Show Mall. The waitresses has always been on point each time I've gone there. They seem to remember us each time we've gone there and that's always a \"+\" in my book.\n\nOverall experiences there has been pretty average and has yet to impress the regulars going there. I hear they have cool Sunday night happy hours but I guess I'll have to go and try to find out."

We checked Ra's website and it said they were still serving food until Midnight so we wandered down and got there a little before 11:30pm. \n\nFirst, there was music blasting so loud that I could barely hear the hostess at the door, and it was bad rap/techno blends. Then the hostess tells us that they will be closing the food soon so to go to the bar area. So my friend and I wander over to the bar which was right next to the DJ, and the bar was completely full so we sat down at a table about 5 feet away. There was people with menus and food at tables either side of us, so we thought no big deal. \n\n10 minutes go by, of waiters and waitresses, 3 of them for 2 tables, ordering and cleaning up the rest. We finally snagged one, and asked if we could order. She just rolled her eyes and said they were closing down, and walked away. Finally the Hostess came over, got our orders for 2 creme brulees, so easy to do, and brought us waters. The next 20 minutes, we sat there, totally ignored by the wait staff, even as they walked right by us, until my friend went to talk to the hostess again, who found our creme brulees and brought them to us. The only time the wait staff willing interacted with us was when it was time to pay and my friend got up with the bill fold to pay at the bar with it. \n\nNeedless to say, we didn't leave a tip. \n\nThe only reason I am giving them 2 stars at all, is the Hostess did her best to make sure we got our dessert, and coconut vanilla creme brulee was absolutely amazing."

They delivery the wrong order. Please have gotten served before us, our food order has taken over a hour to arrive to the table. \n\nI really think the only reason why we continue to go here is because we don't want to drive out for lunch. Working in the mall you run out of options so this tends to be the place for lunch. I mean the happy hour menu and their food overall isn't bad. It's the service and time!

Look up the choices online, place a call at least 24 hours ahead, and schedule a time to pick it up.\n\n I don't like going to the bar to pick up my order. The female bartender there ignored me for a group of sweaty, red faced men grouped at the back of the bar and I mean even AFTER they got their drinks. There was no one else there except for me! When she finally addressed me, she was rather stern and to the point. I tipped the person who walked out with my tray directly. Forget the uptight witch behind the counter...\n\nThe sushi on the to-go platter seems to be pretty fresh, but don't expect AYCE sushi quality. It's probably been made early in the morning and is somewhat dry and very firm by the time you pick it up.\n\nIf you plan on coming here for a date, you might want to re-think it solely based on the fact that its very LOUD. Like Nightclub loud. If you don't mind eating and yelling at your date, then go right ahead, the food is decent enough. \n\nThe spicy miso is nasty. I loooove miso soup, but the spicy miso tastes like regular miso soup with Frank's Red Hot splashed in the broth... and that's it. It takes away from the rich, full, flavor of a good miso soup and replaces it with a cheap vinegar-y taste.\n\nParking can be horrendous if you plan on parking underneath the mall in the parking garage. It took me over an hour to find parking one summer. Other times I've driven straight to the elevator area and walked right in."

Granted my friend and I were hungover and time was moving quite slowly, but wowww things were slow. \n\nWe started off with waters to help with the hangovers and put in a few orders for apps to hold us over until some other friends joined us - turned out they were too hungover to move and never managed to make it, but thats another story.   The apps took a long time to come out, but eventually we were munching away and somewhat happy.   Then we placed our entree orders.  We both went with a lunch special which was nicely priced and probably the only good thing I have to say about RA.   Then my friend fell asleep... that's literally how long it took them to get our miso soups out (aren't these already made and just need to be heated up??) and then fell asleep again before our entrees came out - and these were not complex entrees!    Geez, imagine if I had to come here for lunch on my lunch break from work - I'd probably be fired by the time I got back to work!   Anyways - food was ok, and at this point our waters had long run dry.... I pretty much had to beg for a refill.   \n\nAll in all, the price was cheap and that left my wallet happy, although personally I left annoyed and swearing off any other RA location!"

This joint is our  must come for a quick fix type of place for us because we just love the tasty treats here.  It's the same as the one in Tustin on redhill location, but  dining in RA vegas, just seems alittle more fun.  I'm a little guilty for enjoying the non-vegan dishes this time...but like I said it's hard being vegan at vegas especially trying to be fair about the places and choices of food to eat with your partner.  \n\nSo I will just make this quick.  Very nice setting as usual...I love munching in the low dim glow of red lights all over, it's very intimate and makes the time more enjoyable.  Our waitress was very pretty by the way...I was drawn to her natural beauty...something we hardly see in vegas/employees. \n\nWe got the chicken yakisoba which was mediocre. Only got it because of the veggies and noodles in it.  I love rolls...so we had over 5 different orders of rolls, and to me they all taste the same everywhere..cheap or expensive it taste the same.  The appetizers, this is a must order; the lobster spring roll. That was my favorite of all dishes.  It's lobster rolled up in fried thinly crisped wonton paper mixed with mango, cream cheese, & mild peppers.  It's the tastiest lobster roll I've ever had so I savored every morsel of it. lol because it was that good!  Comes in about 4 or 5 pieces so order more than 1 plate. The racklin shrimp was also a delight.  It's a crispy crumby type of shrimp that is placed on top of green lettuces that you dip into ginger teriyaki sauce.  Very very tasty.  I enjoyed it muchos. \n\nCinnamon tempura ice cream was such an indulgence for my sweet tooth.  The green tea ice cream was okay.  I don't really drink alcohol so I tried their strawberry ginger lemonade.  It taste like strawberry sprite. So it's a nay for me. One of the items we got was in a happy hour menu so we got about $5 off our bill.  If you're wondering, I did finish everything in my giant size stomach.  My partner and I finished everything.  Let's just say we had to walk it off for the remainder of the night.  Total: you're absolutely full & everything was worth every penny."

Yet, my one star has nothing to do with the food (which still is only a 2 in its own right). On my last visit, our table of seven requested to have one of the two TVs turned to a sporting event of our choosing. Yet, it was readily apparent that the manager was far too interested in a certain football game to change the channel. (It was also apparent that no one else was watching TV in the joint - the place was empty.) Upon a second request, the manager changed the channel of the second TV which was farther away from our table and obstructed. I am perfectly fine with not getting a TV changed if another customer requested something else before me. Yet, when it is an employee - let alone a manager - who prefers something else, they are probably in the wrong profession. Add to all of this that there were seven of us in an otherwise dead restaurant. Simply pathetic."

I was right about the great sushi part because it was actually delicious, but that does not outweigh our TERRIBLE service that we had.\n\nThe night started out fine and it seemed like our server had 15 girls under control. We ordered drinks/apps first, then entrees. Everyone's food came out randomly which is fine, but he completely forgot to bring out the bride's order... yikes. He seemed to get more gradually annoyed at us, but I guess we were a big group. You'd think they would be used to bigger groups in Vegas though. So after everyone was eating for a while, he finally brought out the bride's entree and proceeded to charge her for that, which I didn't agree with.\n\nThen comes the good part... when the check came, he put it all on ONE check. This would take forever to try and figure out, so we asked for him to split it in separate checks. I'm not kidding when I say his exact words were \"I don't have time to sit and split the check for everyone because it would take too long, and I know me and all of you have things to do and places to go\" - I mean not exact, but that's basically what he said. EXTREMELY RUDE. So guess what. We sat there for almost 45 minutes trying to split that freaking check, when we had places to be and bachelorette plans at night. He kept ignoring our table after that and avoiding us. We asked to see a manager, and his response was \"why do you want to see my manager\" ... are you kidding? The bride's mom and her friends did not let anything sit, so they were talking to our server, then finally the manager... I'm not sure how anything got resolved. So after all of that chaotic mess, we ended up putting it on one bill and giving cash/paying by Venmo, which was still a mess. What a disaster.\n\nThis was probably one of the worst service and dining experience I've ever had, and I think that most/all of the girls would also agree. DO NOT go here in big groups, and don't expect good service. It's sad because the sushi was good, but definitely not worth the experience."

When my friends and I order, it always seems like we're going overboard, but we just know what we like and we like it all. =) I can't remember everything we order.. but one of my favs is the scallop dynamite."

Like all Vegas restaurants, the food is pricy. What makes restaurants in Vegas so good is that they are ALL suppose to taste good...especially if the ambiance looks fancy! \n\nRA Sushi Bar was just decent. I wasn't wow-ed away by any of the sushi rolls my gf and I shared. We got 3 rolls: \n\nRA Lollipop: It was basically wrapped in rice paper with raw fish on the inside. I wasn't a fan of the sauce it came with because it enhanced the fish taste when I dipped it in. The presentation was nice. It rolls came on a stick so that it could emulate the \"lollipop\" look. \n\nLobster Shrimp Roll: Couldn't really find the lobster or taste the lobster flavor in this roll. It seemed more like of a California roll topped with shrimp. Not only that if you dip the roll in the pesto sauce it comes with, the sauce overpowers the flavor so you couldn't have been able to tatse the lobser with the pesto taste covering it. Also the shrimp wasn't a bright pink color like I am used to. It looked kinda dead... \n\nViva Las Vegas Roll: Honestly the best thing about this roll was the eel sauce it was drenched with. That's about it! \n\nOkay sushi place, I've had better!"

Everything tasted awesome and the prices were very decent for being such a nice place. Great music and happy vibe to the restaurant.

Our waitress was really nice and made sure she checked in on us often. Ordered a couple of rolls and decided to try every flavor of sake they had on the menu (at $1 each, why not?)....let's just say the rest of the night, i was feeling gooooood! =)\n\nThe next time I went to this place was for lunch with another friend, and we grubbed! Again we had another cool waitress that served us (she was pretty hot too....i forgot her name, but she had wavy hair and a nose ring...in case you're reading this ms. hot waitress...u rock!) The food was good and the fried tempura ice cream for dessert was yummy! I heard that this place is pretty popular with the locals, and they have industry nights complete with a DJ and happy hour specials. Gotta check that out next time! The whole vibe of the place is very hip and geared more for the young crowd. So I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Vegas, and don't wanna do the usual buffet routine...it's right outside the Fashion Show mall, off the strip. Perfect for a date or a big group of friends to hang out at for drinks and food."

So for $10 I can get wasted and feel great!  \n\nEvery time I walk in, the security already knows me and gives me a hug to greet me.  The setting is very laid back and casual.  There's no dress code and it's comfortable.  As I enter, on the right there's the DJ booth and there's always different DJ's spinning.  On Wednesday's they have an open spin night.  The decor is very modern with bamboos for plants.  There are some good art work on the wall to spice up the scenery inside.  \n\nAs I walk a few steps more, there lies the bar and on most occasions that's where I'll end up but sometimes I'll take the table if I felt like it.  The stools are very comfortable and cushiony.  There are a lot of candles lit up through out the bar to give some lighting.  For the sports lovers, a huge flat screen TV hangs above the bar for some entertainment.  I've watched the Ms. USA on there one time.  \n\nThe menu is mouthwatering and deliciouso.  I've eaten everything on there so I know it's all good.  I can't pin point which is my favorite because they're all just different.  Only sad part is they don't have any oysters in the menu.  :(  What's awesome about this spot is the different flavor sake.  i didn't realize there were so many different kinds.  I found my favorite to be Pineapple.  mmmm... yummy."

The food was good, though not great, and the service all but sucked.\n\nSat at the bar to avoid waiting and to feel the breeze from outside.  It was dirty, and no one bothered to wipe it down.  By the time our food came we were the only ones left seated at the bar, and we were pretty much left to fend for ourselves.  We managed to waive down our server/ bartender to get a fourth plate for our group of four, but had to scavenge for soy sauce dispensers that weren't empty.  Add a crab roll being brought instead of the nigiri we ordered (they did end up charging us for the nigiri instead of the roll, but we had to point out the discrepancy, and still didn't get what we'd actually ordered).\n\nPotstickers were very good.  Salmon was pretty good, as was whatever roll was basically a Philly roll with avocado and mango sauce on top.  Crab roll was OK but had lots of rice- nigiri would have been better to taste it.  I don't recommend the mango sauce on rolls without avocado- it just seemed too sweet to me, but my friend liked it so if you like sweet sushi then it'd be good.\n\nThe guy was nice enough, and maybe it was just a bad day, but all in all not what I expect when I'm dropping enough cash to do AYCE at other sushi spots.  Would consider coming for happy hour, otherwise I probably won't be back."

The waitress came and was taking our order while I saw something run behind the menu. I wasn't sure if I saw something or what but I moved the menu and saw this creature quickly running. I realized it was a baby cockroach (it was still very BIG). I jumped out of my chair and pointed it out and the waitress was trying to smack it. She then didn't see where it went and I told her it's now on my chair. She smacks it dead, actually she smashes it dead with its guts on my chair! I quickly start putting my coat on and gathering my things while she takes her time to grab a wet cloth to clean it up with. After she cleans it up she proceeds to ask what we would like to order. I look at her like she's crazy and tell her we are leaving. Her response \"oh, this is normal. It's because we have the open patio\". I don't care what the reason is when I see a cockroach running across from me and where my sushi is being prepared!! All I could picture was that cockroach and it's family running on top of my sushi!

The asparagus in the tempura was excellent, as was the avocado mini-roll, but everything else (coupled with the less-than-stellar service) was just meh. \n\nWe left without much of an inkling to go back. Sorry, Ra, you failed to win me over!"

My most recent visit, which was last week during happy hour, was pretty bad.\n\nI will start with the bad.  The happy hour menu was cheap enough, but only had about 10 things to choose from.  The sushi we ordered was fine, nothing special, but anything that came out of the fryer was terrible.  The crab cakes were absolute crabp.  The fried spicy tuna roll was not edible.  At the end of the day, I would have rather paid full price for food I could eat than half price for food I cannot.  Even at full price, I recommend paying a bit more and eating at a top-notch sushi spot, which Vegas has a lot of.\n\nAgain, the past visits were not bad, just not great.  I would have given 3 stars until my most recent visit.  The location is on the frontage of the Fashion Show Mall, just across from Wynn.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  No reservations are needed and they don't seem to have a dress code.  Park at Fashion Show in self-park or valet, or walk from your hotel."

Has a dining room area with a sushi bar.  It also has a seperate partitioned bar area where you can just drink and share a couple appetizers.  \n\nFood- Everything was very tasty, especially the lobster spring rolls.  The presentation of the food also felt chic.  We got 3 different sushi rolls, lobster spring rolls, vegetable tempura (yum), and beer for under $30 including tip during happy hour!  \n\nService- It wasn't very busy when we went, but the service was still kind of slow.  But when we did manage to track down our server, she was helpful, friendly, and professional."

When she finally got there we were ready to order. \n\nI ended up getting a bento box and a new zealand roll. The bento box included miso soup. I love miso soup. The roll was good. It had scallops and kiwi on it. It was a mix of sweet and sushi. I liked it. It was funny as we left we noticed that the restaurant had a booth for a dj.

Maybe because we were hungry, right next to the Fashion Show Mall, and it was right around Ra Sushi happy hour time. \n\nWhen we arrived, the place was pretty empty and the music was pretty low. Besides the lighting, the atmosphere was the complete opposite of the first time I came here when it was jam packed and extremely noisy. \n\nWe were seated right away in a comfy booth. The waitress explained the menu and brought out water right away. We decided to order sesame chicken wings, tootsi maki roll, shrimp tempura roll, edemame, and dengaku tofu. \n\nThe food came one at a time and we devoured each plate. My favorite dish was probably the chicken wings. They were just so flavorful and perfectly marinated. I also really loved the tofu. My boyfriend didn't enjoy it that much, so I pretty much got it all to myself, which was a nice treat. \n\nAll in all, I was surprised at my experience since I wasn't all that fond of this place the first time around. I think it's best to come here sometime in the middle of the week when the place isn't so crazy and you can actually hear the person you're with. If you happen to come at a time like this, it's actually a decent experience. The food was actually pretty good and the service was fast as well."

Delicious and super fresh fish!\n\nAlso, the sake bombs were really great here.

It has a patio area to people watch which is pretty fun.  Coming in at lunch on a Sunday was pretty quiet and they do have some nice lunch specials like $10 bento boxes and a few other meal plans.  The bento box itself wasn't too bad in terms of value.  You get miso soup, rice, the bento box entree you chose (I got chicken teriyaki) and a small salad.  I also got the sake samplers which was $9 for three different sake tastings which were pretty good.  The miso soup wasn't too shabby.  The rice was just rice - nothing special.  The chicken teriyaki was a bit salty but was cooked all right.  And the salad was not bad.  Service was solid and helpful.   \n\nThey also have a happy hour (about 4-7PM if I remember correctly) with some good sushi/drink deals.   \n\nDon't expect too much from RA in terms of the best food in the area.  However, if you're coming at the right moments (whether it's happy hour or lunch), the people watching is fun and the deal isn't too shabby either."

IT was flavor full and filled with all the veggies and goodies that I love\n\nI also had the Calamari and omg this calamari was so soft and tender that it felt like you were eating jello. But don't get me wrong the batter was still so crispy that it was so addictive. \n\nI also enjoyed the crispy onion albacore, it was so delicious that the second time we went we order three plates! \n\nThe Tropical roll was to die for! So basically it had cucumber, mango and avocado rolled onto some spinach tempura bits. But the thing that made it amazing was the mango salsa that they threw on top of it all that gave it a refreshing and unique flavor. \n\nThe Viva Las Vegas is something that you should enjoy...well when you are in Vegas! So so tasty, there is just so much in it and so much going on the flavors are like a punch to the mouth! \n\nFor dessert we had something like a banana split roll, it was like a egg roll with a banana in it sliced up like sushi. Then it had strawberries and chocolate drizzled on top. It was the perfect way to end the meal. \n\nStop by for happy hour because it's well worth the trip! \n\nHappy Eatings! =]"

It had edamame in it which I really like in my salads. My dad had the sushi dinner platter, which I had some of as well. It definitely wasn't the best sushi we've had, but it was okay. My mom is not a fan of sushi, so she had the teriyaki chicken bowl and she also ordered vegetable tempura, which was not overly battered and oily, so that was great! To drink, I decided to try the iced green tea but had to have it taken back because it was intolerable. It tasted like seaweed, honestly. That's what my dad said, I thought it was hilarious, and I agreed.\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere is quite  trendy, it's pretty dark inside too. The one thing that stands out the most about this place is that it's super LOUD. Don't come here if you want to chat with whoever you're with. \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience, and I'd give it another shot if presented with the opportunity next time I'm in Vegas."

About 10 minutes later, mind you it has been about 35 minutes for us, our shit for brains waitress comes out carrying a plate or two of food and we thought finally food is here! No guess not, she walks over to the table she just seated next to us and said something like this \"oh the kitchen messed up *stupid giggle* and they made all this extra food you guys can have it since you've waited so long *annoying giggle*\", I wanted to get up and slap the ho! She got a $1 tip for being an asshole. Other than that, the food was a trendy and some what a not successful attempt to be creative with Japanese food. I love traditional Japanese food too but I do appreciate new twists on things. Some things on their menu worked while some I just looked at the description and cringed.

In addition to sushi that most people are familiar with, RA also adds twists to many of their rolls. Their famous Viva Las Vegas Roll is great, plated very well, and is part of the Happy Hour menu! The menu is quite unique, and you will not be able to find most of the items on their menu anywhere else (sans the traditional rolls).\n\nHappy Hour is half off select appetizers and rolls, while certain drinks are marked at a set lower price. This is one of the best selling points, but I noticed that it is also one of their caveats. While I was not disappointed during regular hours, I ordered the same roll during Happy Hour, and the roll just didn't seem up to par as during regular hours. I guess they have to meet up with increased demand? Regardless, this doesn't bother me, as the quality is still far above anything else I have tried.\n\nFood: Best place to get sushi on the Strip\nDrinks: Plentiful, even better during Happy Hour\nService: Great\nIf it's busy, you can always walk around the shopping center to kill time.

Below are the dishes I personally ordered and tasted.  \n\nWe ordered \nChilli Ponzu yellow tail roll - the sauce was awful, it was literally just hot sauce no intricate flavors.\n\nHot Mess - the rice was over cooked to the point it felt like you were chewing on a rock. And they did not use King crab more like Fake KING KRAB.\n\nPork Gyoza - Normally my daughter and I can't stop eating these, but these had no flavor we left half on the plate.\n\nRa chips and salsa - I have no idea what they were thinking. They covered the sushi with a overly sweet and sticky sauce that destroyed the fish flavor. I took 3 bites trying to like them but left the rest.\n\nGarlic Edamame was the only decent edible food.\n\nThen I ordered a teriyaki chicken for my daughter because she flat out refused to eat her favorite Gyoza. Asked them to please omit the teriyaki sauce just bring the cooked chicken. What we got was disgusting. It was covered in oil and all I can assume is black flakes all over it, reminiscent of grease leavings in an oil fryer. I have no clue I don't even care, at this point I was done with this place.  \n\nAnd the cherry on top..... my husband got food poisoning and was sick for days. \n\nIt's pretty safe to say we will be telling all our friends to avoid this place at all costs.

Then the other mother got the tuna salad and it was nice but didn't seem anything special as limited tuna in it and a basic salad with tuna on top.  \nThe service was average as we had to ask for drink refills but she did check twice to see if we needed anything. I did have to ask for more ginger twice as well and we had to ask for chopstix helpers for the kids when most places offer if they have them.

Ordered their signature and expensive Gojira roll. Thought with a name like that the roll must be huge and stuffed with fish.  WRONG!  Roll was tiny and literally had a smear of spicy tuna.  Really stinky small roll totally not worth the price.  The maguro sashimi seemed fresh, but all the rest of our lunch was really mediocre.  Disappointed overall and would not suggest it unless you absolutely have no other choice."

Really.) and tried to find Ra for a mid evening snack, but couldn't. Dunno where it went. Anyhow, last time I was there it was good stuff. It's not the best in Vegas, but it was certainly one of the simplest experiences I had there. It isn't worth cabbing to the Luxor for, but once you're there and you've washed down too many three-foot ra-aritas upstairs, come slide some RAw fish down."

It does look close, what they don't realize is that with all the causeways and walkways and the fact it's 115 degrees outside and that we need to keep stopping to light cigarettes, finish our mojitos, and check our cell phones that are blowing up, that it will take 15 minutes to walk there.\n\nRA Sushi is on the Wynn side corner of Fashion Show Mall, totally Vegas style, you've pretty much got a lot of what you want in there, and also a lot of what you don't. On the darker side in regards to lighting (note: beneficial information, darker means cooler temperature, bonus) the restaurant has a large sushi bar and wonderful glowing red orb light fixtures throughout giving it a modern yet Asian feel. There's always ample seating, my servers are gracious and usually totally hot (note for men: hot sexy waitresses serving sushi, not bad) and their outside area is where you'll find me and my crew.\n\nVeggie gyoza potstickers with spicy sauce, super tasty miso soup (yes, sometimes there IS a difference), and beef skewers that just hit the spot. There's even a happy hour where drinks and sushi/appetizers are extremely inexpensive so we stock up before we hit the tables once again. The sake list is good, so you can get your drink on, and the mixed drinks aren't half bad at all. My sushi comes quickly and is always fresh. The fish is good and light, and the rolls creative and most on the larger side. You don't have to drop dollars and make it rain to eat like a rockstar here which is good, especially if you hit up Sushi Roku the night before and your 400 dollar bill isn't exactly what you were looking for to spend for lunch with your roll dawgs. \n\nMy waitress hooked me and my girl up last time like superstars, and she's always taken care of me there. We tip well, they take care of us. Plus afterwards if you've gotten your buzz on as appropriate in Vegas, you can go shopping galore inside, walk back across the street (for the high rollers) and hit the Wynn, or do as we do: Plan ahead, wear our bikinis to go to the pool, desperately try to make it everyday, and instead end up sitting at the tables, playing like it's going out of style."

The server warned me that the sushi bar was backed up and my order might take a while. Fair enough, I wasn't in a hurry.\nThe dynamite roll arrived within 5 minutes, awesomely quick, and it was delicious. By the time I was finished with my dynamite roll I still haven't received water or my sake. I flagged down the server, who finally brought me some water.\nAfter about 30 minutes the first 2 pieces of nigiri (salmon) arrived, but without wasabi. The salmon was not the freshest. After about another 10 minutes, the second order of nigiri arrived (eel) and by that time I also got my sake. The eel was good.\nSummary:\n- service was unsatisfactory. It wasn't the long wait for my food, but the fact that I repeatedly had to flag down my server to get my stuff\n- raw fish was not fresh\n- cooked items were good\n- prices are good\nI probably won't be back but give some other sushi bars in Las Vegas a try."

The cuts were perfect and thick. It's wasn't the best,but it pass.\nViva Vegas Roll how can they like this. The roll barely had any spicy tuna mostly imitation crab,and it was to sweet for my taste buds.\nCrispy Onion Albacore was a mess on the plate. The albacore looked like it was cut by a dull knife. Plus they drowned it with so much ponzi sauce were you couldn't taste the fish anymore.\nTropical Roll was ok. It was something different. Great presentation but no Wow factor there.\nThe only reason it made it to 3 star instead of 2 is because of the yellowtail sashimi was good.Other than that there's better places to get your sushi fix."

Awesome sushi and drinks which are usually half off, but recently they have changed their happy hour menu. I've always had a great time coming here with friends for a quick bite while at Fashion Show, but the service the last  three times was extremely slow. Once, the girl forgot our cocktails but we asked about them after we received our food and the girl was clueless. It felt like years before the server came back to ask if we wanted anymore food or drinks, by then I was rather upset and got the check instead. Either RA needs to provide more staffing or figure out a way to make service move a bit faster. \n\nOverall, I can't complain about this place. $2 Edamame and $5 Tootsie Maki rolls will eventually make me want to go back."

I was disappointed, both by the staff and by the food.  The happy hour menu offers some lower prices before 7pm every day, so my wife and I got to the restaurant at around 6:15pm to make sure we ordered off the happy hour menu.  Most of the regular menu prices are just too high to justify ordering.  \nSome of the food items were discounted more than others, but I was very disappointed that there are NO sushi rolls with ahi tuna on the happy hour menu.  The only tuna roll on the happy hour menu is the Pacific Roll, which has albacore tuna.  We ordered the Pacific Roll, along with a spicy salmon roll, some salmon sashimi, and a spicy tuna-crispy rice appetizer.  The salmon sashimi was the best of all the menu items we tried, and the only item that we would absolutely order again (it's also the one that's based most on the fish and least on the quality of the chefs).  The spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna appetizers were average.  The Pacific roll, on the other hand, was terrible.  The albacore tuna tasted like it came from a can, and I could not finish the roll.\nOur waiter was also pretty bad.  He started off by sitting on the table next to us while taking our order, not just leaning against the table, but actually sitting on the eating surface.  I almost felt like telling the people who sat there after he got up, and I wondered if he also sat on our table.  Once our server took our order, he disappeared into the back or just chatted with other employees the whole time.  When we were done eating, I had to flag down a buss-boy to ask for our check, and when the server brought it to us, he disappeared again for over 10 minutes before he picked up the credit card.  He then went to go chat and joke with some other employees for about ten minutes BEFORE he even ran my card through the machine.  \nWith the combination of high prices, lack of selection on the happy hour menu, bad tasting rolls, and bad service, I will not be back here again."

Like other yelpers mentioned, you come for the atmosphere and to people watch!  \n\nMy last couple of visits have been on Sunday nights, late Sunday nights.  It's Service Industry Night (S.I.N.), and they have food and drink specials from 8 pm to midnight.  It's crowded by the bar, and the restaurant is still hopping.  Grab a drink and take a seat outside if you want to chitchat or in my case last night, sit under the heating lamp to stay warm.  A lot of locals hang out there despite it being on the strip.  Located in Fashion Show Mall, it can carry a crowd depending on the night.  As of late, they were advertising Reggae Nights and 80s Nights.  You'll find a small dance floor and if the DJ is spinning out some good tunes, it'll be too crowded for you to bust a move.  But that's okay, there are some good-looking people here that are worth watching out for.\n\nWhen I leave Ra, I see red...\n\nMaybe someday I'll come by and try out their happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm on weekdays.  Or just swing by during their regular hours and have a taste of their Signature Sushi.\n\nUpdate! 03/19/08 - Why do I always find myself here on Sunday nights?  This time I had a chance to sit down and try the food.  We lucked out with a party of ten at 11:30 pm with no reservations.  We only had to wait about ten minutes to grab a table.  \n\nI took advantage of their SIN food specials and got the Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($3.25), the Spicy Tuna Roll ($3.75), and the Scallop Dynamite ($3.50).  There's nothing special about these rolls, they use Sriracha  to make it spicy, and it's not one of my favorite ways to do it.  We thought the Scallop Dynamite was going to be a roll, but it's actually scallops and Asian mushrooms baked in their 'Dynamite' sauce.  It's pretty tasty, and the BF was eating up all the onions that came along with it.\n\nI also tried their Coconut Shrimp Tempura ($3.75).  It comes with about four deep fried shrimps on skewers with a roasted pineapple dipping sauce.  It's probably best to eat them while their hot, it was okay by the time I got to them.  \n\nThe really great thing about their SIN drink specials is the $1.00 Warm Sakes.  However, they ran out of Sake flasks (tokkuris)!  The waitress arrived with our sake in wide rimmed glasses which pretty much defeats the purpose of the flask which is to prevent the heat from escaping!  They also ran out of sake cups (ochokos), so we asked for shot glasses.  She was completely out of that as well!  She did apologize profusely and it appeared she actually went around to look.  They just didn't have enough people cleaning up the tables and washing the dishes.  (I personally think it's a management problem and they should be used to their busy Sunday nights and sake drinking crowds.  Running out of tokkuris and ochokos really is unacceptable.)  As a result, I brought their rating from a four to a three."

I had a beef bento box, and I also tasted my friend's sushi dishes, because she's always one that is up to share with others. My bento box just didn't mesh together well. The flavors don't really compliment each other. The beef was average, and everything else on the box was below average. It's just nothing to write home about, but it is satisfying if you are crazy starving and still want to shop some more at the mall (but don't want to move). \n\nIt's a very easy and accessible place to revisit because of it's location, but it just didn't taste very good.

No, we haven't moved, still right here.  She drops off our appetizers and asks us if there's anything we need. Um... drinks? Waters? Please? Oh... sure, sorry. She goes over to the bar and picks them up where they have evidently been sitting for a while.  We start happily noshing and the food is so good, just what we needed after a long day at a pool party :) We ask our waitress for soy sauce because there's none on our table. Instead of grabbing one from another table, she randomly wanders off for 5 minutes only to return empty handed again. SOY SAUCE PLEASE. It's sushi! You need soy sauce! Oh, right. She gets some from the sushi bar.  Anything else? We politely ask for some glasses, she delivered our sake bottle with no glasses and there are 4 of us.  Glasses? she asks. Yes. For the sake. Oh... you mean like... oh. Ok just a minute. We literally just stared at each other in disbelief. Maybe before Ra hires people they should make them actually eat a sushi dinner first, so that the servers are aware of what normally accompanies such a meal (soy sauce, drinks, glasses, chop sticks).  haha I know I'm being bitchy, it was probably her first day or something, but jeez.

One of the best places to have sushi on the strip.The last three times I've been to Vegas, we ordered the entire Happy Hour menu, which is about 15-18 items, all for roughly $45!!!! Be sure you have plenty of people to share it with, I suggest about 4 people! Imagine, $10 per person for an assortment of sushi and other Japanese dishes!! You cannot find good quality food at this price that will leave you satisfied in Vegas anywhere!! My favorites are the Coconut Shrimp Tempura and the Scallop Dynamite!! YUMMM!!!\n\nThe party never stops in Vegas,  so expect loud music spun by an in house DJ (of course with a pre-made set), plasma screen tv's and a full bar!! Great atmosphere for the non-stop party animals!! \n\nHappy Hour prices are also available for sake and beer, just $6 for both. \n\nThis place can get a bit crowded around 8PM, so anticipate a long wait, or try to come early, or even try to come in late after the ideal dinner time. I believe Happy Hour starts at 6PM and ends at 12AM. Make sure your order is in before 12 to keep happy hour prices."

Last minute there were more people added to our party and the hostess was accommodating. Though it took some convincing and i believe it was due to them not being busy that night. We started our dinner with a round of drinks and some peppers. Their peppers were undercooked and the worst of all places i had ordered the same type of peppers. \n\nWe also ordered ceviche as an appetizer which was served with unrippened avocados, one type of fish, and maybe a few shrimp. Though it was the best of all items ordered, it was definitely not considered \"good.\" Once our drinks came out, we were all enjoying our time and placed our entree orders with the server. Our roll took the longest to arrive and it was not even the correct order. We continued to just eat the unsatisfactory appetizers to suppress our hunger and continued asking the server when our roll would be out. As everyones food finished they brought out our roll and another appetizer that they had forgotten to originally deliver. \nWe felts as though for a place like Las Vegas, we would have had more attentive servers and much better customer service. We had to wait around 20 minutes for them to bring out our bill, which we asked numerous times for. The bill had a lot of incorrect orders on it and we had to have them adjust again which required another 15 minutes of our time. \nOverall the dinner experience was mediocre at best. I understand that we were a large party and it is more difficult to accommodate everyones needs, but the lack of attentiveness we received was not acceptable. However, they did have good fried rolls, which is what a few of the other members in our party had ordered. But if you like real sushi and quality fish RA is definitely not a place to consider."

The set up is kind of odd too, I thought it was weird how the bar was sorta isolated from the restaurant, but i suppose it would be nice to sit at on a sunny day when people are dining in their outside patio.  Anyway, my BF and I were seated promptly along side a somewhat booth area on the other side of the sushi bar, right behind the bar.  The hostess was pretty nice; she told us we were able to sit wherever we liked- i'm a big fan of this option.\n\nTheir happy hour just started when we got there (4pm) so we ordered a few things on there.  $2 edemame was fine- not something you can easily mess up.  We also got a spicy yellowtail cut roll- this was alright; it wasn't bad or good- and some nigiri pieces.  From the regular menu we ordered salmon sashimi and some type of yellowtail dish served on a ginger/ponzu sauce or something like that.  The nigiri seriously looked like it was made by one of those buffet sushi machines and lacked any sushi chef skills whatsoever.  It also looked like it wasn't made to order.  My salmon sashimi was a horrible dish!!  I believe it was $9.50 for seven pieces of butchered ass cut sashimi.  OMG, the pieces were a sorry excuse for sashimi and I can't believed they served something like that.  Whoever cut them obviously lacked skill with the knife and is not a sushi chef.  I could've done a better job with a butter-knife.  Because of this horrible craftsmanship and  the not so fresh taste, i chose not to eat it and the waitress took it away.  The yellowtail dish was no different as far as cut was concerned, but it was masked by all the greens it was topped with.  The taste of the fish was edible, but i'm sure it  was because of the citrus sauce.\n\nService was ok.  It was a rather slow afternoon and things were mellow.  I don't know how busy this place gets, as it was my first time, but since it was slow our server was pretty attentive and made some suggestions.  I don't know if I would come back here, especially with all the other options in Vegas.  The prices are not bad for a strip restaurant, but you can definitely go off strip and find better quality/priced Japanese joints.  Though, I feel like I should maybe give them one more chance because I didn't really order any of their specialty/original dishes.  If i do come back, i'm definitely not opting for their sushi.\n\n*Happy hour seems like it was a definite steal.  A lot of their appetizers, small plates, rolls, and nigiri were half price.  If you like to drink sake and martinis and such they have a pretty killer happy hour for that, too.  Cheers."

Not only was the service substandard and it took over two hours to get eight dishes but then, when I saw an up charge of $3.50 for a martini after being charged $10 which was never disclosed on the menu and I question it I was told that that is their policy and they would reluctantly remove the charge because I should have known that. I have never heard of a restaurant charging $3.50 to shake alcohol with ice and add three olives. It was never disclosed and the managers attitude was nothing more then completely rude and intolerant. I have no idea where she learned customer service skills or the goal of customer satisfaction.

Nothing really has me craving to go back here and I can already think of a handful of places that I'd rather go to but the location and lower pricing for what's expected of a sushi joint on the strip gives it an extra half star. Everyone is always friendly and the seating inside has a nice date night feel. The go-tos when I come are:\n\nGarlic Edamame: I could drink the garlic sauce. Super flavorful and comes with a good amount of perfectly cooked edamame. I even dip sushi pieces into the leftover sauce lol bomb. $5.30\n\nMango Lobster Roll: lobster mix, avocado & cucumber rolled with mango on top served with mango & kiwi. Their \"lobster mix\" is basically imitation crab, I never taste any lobster at all but I love the mango and kiwi sauce. $11.25\n\nViva Las Vegas Roll: crab and cream rolled inside, light tempura deep fried and topped with spicy tuna, crab mix and light lotus root finished with eel sauce and shrimp tempura pieces. Pretty good and always a hit with the relatives visiting from out of town. $13.25\n\nThey also have lunch specials daily from 11am-3pm.\n\nOverall a nice addition to fashion show mall. A good option after a day of shopping if you're craving something lighter and lower priced however I wouldn't come here out of my way, only if I was already at fashion show. 3.5/5"

Once we walked in, I immediately loved the atmosphere. All the hanging red orbs brightened up the otherwise dark room.\n\nThe hostess was very inviting and made us feel right at home. My girlfriend and I ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, which is alright. I wasn't much of a fan of the crispy piece on top due to that fact that it got stuck on in my teeth and didn't add any flavor. On the other hand, we also ordered the crispy onion albacore which was delicious. I also really like how they plate their food. The presentation was beautiful and makes me not want to eat it and instead, frame it on my wall. The happy hour wasn't that great and prices for some rolls were pretty up there, especially for the Viva Las Vegas roll which didn't do anything for me.\n\nSadly for my friend, he was duped by the server that took care of us. When asking what we good, the server insisted that the Asian crispy tacos were amazing and would highly recommend it. Keep in mind my friend eats anything and everything...even cheap Uni from Kula sushi.  When he got his order, he absolutely hated it. I'm not sure if it was just him but for a recommendation, I would expect the server to offer an item to appeal to everyone.\n\nPresentation, hostess, and atmosphere was definitely a plus. Server recommendation, sushi, and the price is a hit and miss."

The food was great.  The kids enjoyed chicken katsu and rice, and the table shared miso soup, terryiaki chicken, wantons with pineapple/cream cheese, Gyoza, baked scallops, vegas roll, lobster/shrimp roll, and shrimp tempura rolls.  The food was good.\n\nThe problem with this place is the music.  Way to LOUD.  In fact, I think they are an OSHA violation away from being closed down; their employees could file a complaint.  When we arrived, the music was so loud I could not talk to the person sitting next to me without shouting.  I guarantee the music is over the decibels allowed by law.\n\nNot kid friendly, but kid doable."

My son & his gf recommended this place, so we walked over to nearby Fashion Show mall.\n\nFrom the moment you walk in, the fiery red glow of lanterns overhead & the upbeat music pumping throughout this trendy restaurant, will put you in a head-swingin', appetizing mood for some \"RA\"ckin' great food.\n\nOur friendly & attentive server greeted us & quickly took our drink orders. If you're not sure what's good here, no worries, just look for the red dots on the extensive menu indicating customers' favorites.\n\nMost of us got Lunch Special (11am - 3pm) Bento Boxes (served w/ miso soup, uchi no salad, rice, gyoza & a veggie spring roll) -  Shrimp Tempura $8.50 & Chicken Katsu $8.50. I didn't try any of these, but everyone said they really liked it. The Katsu sauce was served with some spicy mustard swirled in it, different, but still good though. Other Bento Boxes on the menu - Veggie Tempura, Chicken Teriyaki, Beef Teriyaki & Salmon Teriyaki ($7.50-8.50).\n\nMy son's gf got one of the Lunch Special Bowls (served w/ miso soup) - Bara Chirashi Bowl (poke-style tuna, salmon, hamachi, shrimp, avocado & cucumber with Asian greens on rice) $10. Again, I didn't have this, but she said it was really good. Other bowls on the menu - Spicy Salmon, Spicy Tuna, Beef Teriyaki & Chicken Teriyaki ($8.25-10).\n\nFor starters we got the \"RA\"ckin' Shrimp $10.25. This app was totally \"RA\"ckin'! A dozen crispy (fried-chicken style), super-crunchy seasoned large pieces of shrimp served on greens with an amazing creamy ginger-teriyaki dipping sauce. The rest of the app menu looked just as incredible -  Blue Claw Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Crispy Soft Shell Crab & Scallop Dynamite are just some of the dozen+ apps on the menu ($7.25-10.25).\n\nAs for my order? C'mon, we're in Vegas, live a little! So I order, from the signature menu , \"Viva Las Vegas Roll\" $13.25. Five unreal-crab (aka imitation-crab) & cream cheese sushi rolls, tempura battered, crispy fried, topped with a spicy tuna & crab mix then crowned with a crispy fried wafer of lotus root, all on a platter drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The flavors of the cream cheese, spicy tuna-crab mix & sweet sauce, the creamy & crunchy textures, combined with the Vegas style presentation, make this thing - simply \"RA\"mazing!\n\nAll of our orders were brought to our table swiftly, team-effort style & my Sapporo (although took a bit longer) made a dramatic entrance, hand delivered by one of the bar staff - awesome.\n\nIn the Fashion Show Mall or nearby & looking for a place to eat? Skip the food court & head to this Strip-level restaurant. No question, this will be on our \"must-eat\" for the next trip. There's something for everyone on the menu, including soups, salads, noodles, a full sushi bar & cocktail bar. Prices are decent, food is great, atmosphere is bumpin' & the service is excellent (as it turns out, our server's a North Shore homegirl) Props to our server \"Raina\" & team RA, br-\"RA\"-ah! You rock!"

Forty-Five minutes for an order of salmon sushi, really? How about the 20 minutes after that when I got my main dish, dear god I spent more time waiting than eating.

I ordered a grilled apple teryaki salmon which arrived with wasabi mashed potatoes.  I was hoping for a great meal but it turned out to be a little too sweet for my tastes and not very good.  I did however get to try some shrimp tempura and squid tempura which was okay, nothing spectular either.  I ordered a \"viva-las vegas\" sushi roll which was okay, but nothing great as well.  Overall, the food at \"RA\" isn't that great and prices are average.  Expect to spend at least $10 on each roll and $15-$20 on their limited entree selections. \n\nI still give RA three stars because of the overall vibe of the restaurant which was kind of cool and hip.  On the saturday night when we dined, there was a DJ spinning really cool music, music you'd hear at a Club or bar.  It was strange because I saw many families eating here and the music was a little inapproriate at times when there were 10 years old and F-bombs flying all round..haha!  Oh well, its Vegas right?  \n\nAlcoholic beverages were very good!  The zen mojito was really good as well as some geisha martini drink that I forget the name of.  Parking for this place sucks as you have to park in a structure for the mall it is adjacent to.  The walk through the mall can be bad so it maybe best to park at the Wynn and walk over Las Vegas Blvd. to get to RA... either way you have to walk a long distance but hey you get to check out things along the way.

They force you to walk over to the Wynn, then go over another bridge only to finally end up at Fasion Mall -- aka the spaceship. The Apple iPod is heavily advertised here and if you walk from the Palazzo to the mall, you'll hear their theme song about 200 times. \"I tried to do headstands for you...\"\n\nThe food at RA never wows me. I ordered the New Zealand Roll and it was interesting! Cream Cheese, Tuna, Scallops, Kiwi, Mangoes, or something like that. It was definitely interesting. The bf didn't enjoy this too much because it was too weird for him but I did! I like weird things.\n\nThe red lights in RA make me feel REALLY sleepy so definitely ask for their tea to keep you awake. Our server was pretty attentive to us and nice. She also told us that their green tea was heavily caffeinated and after having said that, we all wanted some to keep us awake."

            "review": "Came here for my belated birthday celebration in our bar-hopping night on and off the Strip. My friends have been raving about their happy hour which inspired me to check out Ra. Happy hour ends at 7 pm and we arrived about 10-15 minutes before that. I wanted a table but the place was full, so we sat at the bar- our fault for getting there late on a Saturday, I know. The bartenders were nice and even though we barely got there in time and probably ordered just as happy hour was ending, they didn't make a fuss about it and we still got the hh prices. Also I got a complimentary birthday drink. I really can't remember what it was (I am a hard alcohol and mixed drinks noob) but it was so good. It was supposed to be a birthday shot but they gave me just about 1/3 of a glass, so there's customer appreciation right there.\n\nThe happy hour menu has a small but ok selection for drinks, but is definitely limited for sushi. I ordered some half price sushi as well as full price. I've been enjoying sushi for a long time and while not an expert, I think I know good sushi. The quality of the sushi itself is mediocre. It's not a health hazard but the rolls did fall apart a handful of times and were definitely in the bottom half of what I've tasted. It was not bad but just ok. Their sushi is way overpriced especially for what is it (poorly constructed with small cuts) so I would not come here to get full on sushi, but just for a snack or small meal during hh. I'm usually not a big fan of the California roll but it was good here, despite the small portions. My drink was some kind of tropical punch with tequila (sorry, I said I really am a noob) and it was very good. I felt the $5 it cost was not robbery. To add, the time it took for our rolls to come was very appropriate considering they seemed pretty busy.\n\nFor a drink, a free drink and small meal (I think 3 rolls) I spent $19 including tip which is nothing to complain about. Luckily I was not that hungry that their small portions could really bother me, but I had a good experience there with my friends and liked the set up of the bar and especially the good service. Not-bad-but-not-great sushi and high prices will limit my appearances here but it's a good place to snack and hang out with people. I look forward to getting to know their happy hour menu."

It was in tempura sauce with a drizzle of eel sauce but needed more of the eel for flavor.  I added a bit of soy, and ate it with sushi ginger for some bite.\n\nCrispy Spicy Tuna ($5)- I love this at other sushi bars, but this version was just okay. It had a very big piece of rice and it was a bit cold so the crisp rice piece wasn't actually crispy since I suspect it was pre done. \n\nCrispy Onion Albacore ($5)- it was decent but not the best quality of albacore and very thin slices topped with some sesame dressing, French's onion, a bit of sprouts. \n\nThe server was friendly and kept up with drinks and checked on me whenever she passed by. \n\nI think it's a good option when you are a tourist since there is very few happy hours or \"deals\" on the strip and there are a good amount of options on the HH menu.

If you want some help ordering, go for the guest faves!  They even make yummy green beans and we also like the degaku tofu. I like the cucumber \"kimchee\".  It's not like real Korean kimchee but if you like cucumbers it's a nice refreshing side dish.  My family loves the chicken wings and the tacos in addition to their sushi and rolls."

I wanted sushi on my last trip to Vegas, but didn't want to leave the strip. I ask a friend if there was any good sushi place on the strip and she suggested this place, but she said it kind of pricey. Lucky for me we came on a Sunday during Happy Hour and the prices were actually good. \n\nI give the food 3 Star. It was good, but nothing special. Lucky I came during happy hour cause I wouldn't think it worth the full price. However there presentation is worth 4 stars it nice and very elegant. We order most of the things on the Happy hour menu and they were all good. I wouldn't order the Sashimi because it wasn't worth the price we paid since it wasn't on the Happy Hour menu, but I like Sashimi, but what we got wasn't good. \n\nThe place look very nice and hip. It a good place for a group of friends to hang out at. We had a table and later ask to be moved to the booth because the rest of our group hadn't show up yet and a booth was free. They moved us quickly and didn't have a problem with it. Services was good and everyone was nice. There was a DJ and if you wanted it to be less noisy you can sit out in the patio area where it more quited. \n\nI give there drinks a 4 Stars it was good and Strong and they have a lot of selection in drinks,  they are a little costly, but it is Vegas."

The Sunday menu is very well priced because there are about 20 items that are half off only on Sundays. Got plenty of sushi for a very reasonable price. The fish was extremely fresh and just melted in your mouth. \n\nThe downsides though; \nThe restaurant, like most of Vegas, had a sort of club like feel to it where as the music was very loud for such a small place. Also, the service is a little slow, it seemed like they were understaffed the night I went. The food is worth the wait if you can get past the club like beats playing throughout the dining room."

The food here is about as authentic Japanese as Mexican General Pancho Villa was an authentic Soviet astronaut. \n\nMaking great sushi is indeed an art, so it would seem like a no-brainer to make something like a chicken teriyaki. That is until you come to RA. Not only was the chicken dry, the rice was soggy - yes, SOGGY - the bok choi was overcooked, the mushrooms were undercooked, and the \"sauce\" was watery. It was horrible. I couldn't even finish half of this dish. \n\nAnd if it was just my dish that was bad, then I'd be forgiving. But it wasn't. My girlfriend's dish was terrible, too. She didn't finish hers either. The best thing on her chicken salad was the avacado, and that was good only because all they had to do was slice it and put it on the plate. She also had some sushi, and complained that it wasn't very good.\n\nService was terrible. The hostess was friendly enough, but the wait staff was awfully slow. We waited for almost 10 minutes while they \"cleared\" a table that was already clear... couldn't she have helped the wait staff out, or was it really that important for her to change the candles on the decor in the lobby at 3pm in the afternoon? When the bill came, our waitress didn't even bother coming back to the table to get my card - we had to take the bill to the hostess. Not the waitress, the hostess. That's terrible service. They got no tip.\n\nAnybody that thinks this is good food is obviously out of their mind, and has absolutely no comparison to good, authentic Japanese food. It's just crap here. The decor is nice, the location is nice, the people watching is nice. But if it doesn't come in a sealed bottle, don't order it, because it's going to be crap.\n\nYou've been warned."

I pointed out the screwed up orders, and he offered to fix it. We told him not to worry about it, and that we just wanted the check, as we had to go. He didn't listen to that either, and instead we were brought the correct order by the manager.

After enduring some ridiculously overpriced, mediocre meals during our visit to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, we were happy to find a place with excellent food and prices more reasonable than back home (suburban Washington DC). \n\nThe husband and I started off with a bang with bottles of sake for $4-which is incredibly reasonable- while kids had strawberry lemonade served all fancy with kosher salt on the glass rims. \n\nThe special rolls- seasonal, dragon, and Gojira, had standout flavors and were large enough to be a stand-alone meal for some (though not for my teens or husband lol). My chirashi bowl was just right- neatly cut pieces of fish, cucumber, and avocado, and a tasty yet not overpowering sauce, served over perfectly cooked and seasoned rice. It was a very generous portion-equivalent to several large rolls- for only the price of a specialty roll. My only criticism is that the menu stated it was supposed to be served with soup, which it was not. I did not complain however, because as it was I was so full (as was everyone else in my family) I couldn't quite finish the bowl so the soup would have went to waste.\n\nThe service was friendly and they frequently refilled our waters and cleared dishes which is a big plus in my book.\n\nToo bad they won't be open tomorrow morning, so we will probably be spending the same amount of money as tonight's dinner on a way-overpriced hotel breakfast."

If the parking situation and prices were lower it would be an easy 5. So basically if this spot wasn't on the strip it would be ideal to me. Although I did enjoy the outdoor seating which included plenty of good people watching. (Fun times at the fashion show mall on Christmas eve) But overall, I had a wonderful experience. \nTo start, we (my sister and I) decided to check out the all day happy hour they offered on the holiday. They did this both Black Friday and Christmas eve, so I am guessing this is a normal holiday or shopping day thing for Ra. Our other halves don't do sushi, so we enjoy exploring new places. The menu pricing seemed high, so all day happy hour was the perfect opportunity. \nWe began our meal with a garlic sesame style edamame. No doubt about it I will order this every single time I come. Why places have not been doing this forever is the real question!\nWe went with a couple classics like a philly roll and shrimp tempura. The tempura roll came with asparagus, Total win to me. I also ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll. A mix of many things topped with spicy crab and a crunchy wheel. I can't even explain it. Just trust that this is the roll you DO NOT want to miss! It started to get cold after the sun wasn't in view anymore so I ordered a Miso HOT! soup. It came out in a rod iron steel type bowl and had shrimp and green beans in it. I will come back for this alone. (well and that amazing edamame!) \nI really wanted to try the hot mess balls as well. A spicy tuna, jalapeno, deep fried ball type thing. Not too sure what it is, but I will be finding out soon! \nAlso the white sangria was super sweet, and the Cucumber Collins was a perfect afternoon. refreshing, nice buzz but not too strong type of drink. Although they didn't give us the happy hour discount on the sangria. We didn't complain because the difference was only $1.75. The real happy hour specials are the rolls.\nAlso, if you're not into sushi they had many shrimp options, and even a couple beef and chicken dishes. I would suggest trying it during one of their many happy hours!"

They got our order wrong, and she snatched the check from my friend and a bunch of paper flew on me. She didn't even apologize. However, our order was fixed, but still, that didn't help her tip!\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back to this place during happy hour on my next Vegas trip!"

The waitress lost it and brought us back another one and asked us if it was ours, and when it wasn't, told us to fill it out again.  It took her forever to bring out drinks.  If it was busy, then this would have been more understandable, but the place wasn't busy at all!   Plus, my friend wanted warm saki, and we were informed they weren't doing warm saki that night.  WTF!  Then, when we get the check, gratuity it added in -- it was one of those cases when she just didn't give a shit.\n\nAs for the food, it was average sushi.  The alaskan king crab nigiri didn't taste very good at all, which was very disappointing.  I was suprised at the fried calamari maki, which was a house speciality and it was good.  Edamame came gratis, which was nice since we were waiting forever for our drinks.\n\nOverall, when I am at a nice restaurant, paying Las Vegas strip prices at a chain restaurant, I expect something better than I get at the budget Chicago Boystown sushi joint.  That is why Ra at the Fashion Show gets 3 Stars."

When we got there, it was around 8:30ish. So not busy at all. Plenty of tables. (Should have been a sign) after we were seated it took 10 mins just to get our drink order. We asked our server what kind of tequilas they had. She replied, no one drinks tequila so I don't know. Do you want me to check? We should have left then. \n\nMy husband and I settled for water. While we waited for the \"real\" server to come and take our order, my husband and I couldn't even have a conversation because the club music was super loud! Ok, I'm not one of those, no loud music people. If there would have been a lot of people in there to absorb the sound it wouldn't have been so bad, but when our server finally came she couldn't hear us either. \n\nSo it was the first part if Feb. and they had just started a Red promotion, with a new roll and a new cocktail. Our server new NOTHING ABOUT IT, even though it was right there in the front of the menu. \n\nSo after 30 mins, we got our 2 rolls and tuna tartar. I asked for more wasabi and sarrachi  sauce, never got either. Never got a refill of our waters.

The woman on the phone I ordered from double checked with me to make sure the order was correct, but when I went to pick up the order was incorrect. I didn't realize this until I got back to work and ended up having to go back to correct the order. When I went up to the bar to ask a girl to fix my order she gave me a pretentious reluctant attitude. I waited a few minutes and because at this point I'm running out of time for lunch I asked if they could hurry and I just want to be seated and eat in. Again the girl at the bar was reluctant and said ok and didn't even offer to sit me. She just walks off! So I seat myself out side and wait. I happen to look over at the bar and see the second waitress assigned to my table just standing, leaning against the counter on her phone. I see a manager notice her and barely reprimanded her. I look over again and the other girl at the bar gives me a dirty look. Finally the waitress gives us our food and never comes by again. I did not leave a tip and I'm never going back again. Number one, please make an extra effort to get to go orders correct. Number two, you have a job, be thankful and do it with pride. Treat your customers with respect and actually give them real service."

It's not a big deal, but it makes a difference to a sushi lover like me. Overall I enjoyed this resturant and I would go back again if I was hungering sushi in vegas!"

So when Jessie asked me to do some shopping at the Fashion Show Mall and dinner here at Ra Sushi I was so down! \n\nIf you don't want to deal with the mall Ra has it's own entrance independent of the mall. I love that they have a patio that faces the strip. Totally made me feel like we we're playing tourist. The inside of Ra has a huge bar and tons of booths. Of course they have a large sushi bar so you can sit at watch all the action. But since it was a nice day we sat on the patio. There was some construction blocking our view, but it wasn't that big of a deal. It still was fun to watch all the people passing by. \n\nJessie had her birthday gift certificate that they give you on your half birthday and it's for $20. If you sign up on Ra Sushi's website ( ra sushi.com ) you can get one too. \n\nSince it was happy hour we took advantage of it by ordering the Citrus Garlic Yellowtail and the Ra Chips and salsa. Jessie ordered the Sashimi plate and some edamame. The Citrus Garlic Yellowtail was sliced so thin and the ponzu sauce gave it great flavor. The Ra Chips and Salsa was my favorite. It was tuna tartar that was mixed with avocado, cucumber, soy sauce and a fresh salsa. Instead of regular chips they had wonton chips that complimented it so well. Jessie's Sashimi plate was beautifully presented. The cuts of Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna, and Whitefish were cut so thin and came with a bowl of rice. The fish was so sweet and the soy sauce accented it perfectly. \n\nOur server was great! She kept our drinks filled and even brought us out more ice when she noticed ours had melted. She also had our food out at a fast pace. \n\nI can not wait to return to Ra Sushi! I've been dreaming about that Sashimi plate and the Ra Chips and Salsa. Those two items are a perfect meal. They do also have items other then sushi on the menu. This is a plus when you have people that don't like sushi and you do. I'll definitely be returning soon. They definitely get a huge YUM from me!"

Take a look at the menu before you go, and if all you see is Viva Las Vegas roll, Gojira roll, and Crazy monkey roll, do you really think they'd be serving you authentic Japanese sushi?? Come on... seriously. I don't think it's fair to rate a place unfavorably because of unreasonable expectations!\n\nMy favorites were Tootsy maki and Crispy spicy tuna. I also liked RAckin' shrimp. Crab cakes were a little too greasy. Spicy miso soup was actually pretty spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, don't get it.\n \nOur waiter was very friendly and helpful.

            "review": "Living in the middle of the desert.. Las Vegas to be exact.. you learn very quicky that there are 5 star sushi joints. And those are the ones you need to go to. I love RA Sushi, and the Las Vegas location(service-wise) wasn't all that when I lived there, and it wasn't all that when we paid a visit in the middle of March, but it's fresh (^_^) I honestly thought it was so-so when I lived here..but 3 years later.. there seemed to be an improvement! \n\nLet's get down to it. RA is located within the Fashion Mall at the end of the \"new\" Strip (Spring Mountain Rd and S Las Vegas Blvd, across from the Wynn & Encode hotels). Therefore it can either be really crowded or really empty. Frankly, it's usually in between..during weekends there is usually some sort of music being played at the bar, and it reverberates through the ENTIRE restaurant. Meaning diners have to listen to he latest hip hop or whatever the DJ is playing. Great if it's a younger crowd, not so much if it's full of older folks (and yes, age varies by day and time too!). Parking can be found behind the Fashion Mall in an underground garage. It's pretty spacious down there, but people drive like morons so watch out! The ambience of RA is..bathed in an annoying red light. Okay, at first I thought \"OMG how cool...\" and then when I tried to read the menu, AND take photos of my food. I had to enlist the help of my flash to get clear photos!! It's he lighting I'd expect of I was going on a date to a restaurant I guess. \n\nThe bar has plenty of alcohol to whip up numerous drinks, and oh so many sakes, wines, bottled beers and . Because sushi and sake bombs, it goes hand in hand. I'm quite the picky eater when it comes to sushi, as it is raw fish, so better safe than sorry right? At least RA has fresh fishies on my plate! RA has 5 types of sushi. Maki, Sashimi, Nigiri, and then hand rolls and specialty rolls (only found at RA locations). Personally, I prefer the specialty rolls and their Maki choices. The shrimp tempura hand roll has a lovely crunch, and fresh chunks of shrimp inside.\n\nWhen browsing the menu, I usually go for what I know. My 1st time eating here was back in 2010 when I first moved to Nevada, and I was still relatively \"new\" to sushi. Now it's a staple. The latest trip provided me with 3 or 4 different rolls. I chose the Vegas Roll, Rainbow Roll, Avocado and Cucumber Rolls, and the garlic edamame. The Vegas rolls were fresh, full of crab and cream cheese mix that played up the crab flavor and wasn't overly strong from the cream cheese.  The tempura decoration on top was tasty too haha. The avocado and cucumber rolls were both fresh, but the chunk of cucumber where difficult to bite through because they were pretty thick..not to mention I still had to get through the layer of rice..not an easy roll to eat in just one bite :(. California roll is standard at ANY sushi place, and just like any other sushi place..it tasted just like every other Cali roll I've had. But, plenty of crab! The slices of fish adorning my Rainbow rolls were fantastic. I'm leary of Rainbows because the fresh fish slices, but the chef came out and reassured me that the fish had been delivered earlier that morning and had the slip to prove it. Can't get much fresher than that..especially when ya know..there's not ocean for a good 300+ miles haha. This particular Rainbow Roll is only found at RA, and while I've seen them elsewhere, the amount of crab meat within the roll, makes it a far better one! I enjoyed my choices, but would probably pass on cucumber rolls again, and maybe the Cali rolls too, just to open up spots for new choices (^_^)\n\nService varies by day, time, and crowd. I came here many times living here, and I had good and bad service from the hostess, to the chef. The chefs are almost always fab, but there was one guy who was just snotty. Didn't see him in March, so maybe he's gone? Anywho, going around peak feeding hours or happy hour seems to generate a few cranky employers, just because it gets so darn busy! Lunch is usually better! Also, sign up for the RA newsletter and get a coupon for a half birthday discount, and plenty of deals that change weekly! I've definitely taken advantage of the half birthday deal, and it was worth it IMO. \n\nRA is a good sushi joint on the Strip, but if you know some locals, hit them up. They have the good ones hidden up their sleeves(^_~), but if not, RA will do the trick if you're wanting sushi and can't drive because you spent the day drinking. I mean, I did give it 4 stars. Service is why it's not a 5. (^_^)"

It was our last day in Vegas, and we let our server know that we had to be at the airport in about 3 hours. She said it wasn't a problem. And then it all went downhill from there.

She didn't offer to make it right or anything. When we told her, she said \"oh, okay\" and walked away.\n\nKnowing how long our food took, we didn't have time to send the wrong dish back because we wouldn't get to the airport in time.

We couldn't find her for drink refills or even the bill when we wanted to leave. I've never had such bad service in my life! Eventually, we had the hostess locate the manager for us so we could make an official complaint. He was apologetic and ended up comping our food for us, which was unexpected but kind of him. If only he had been more on top of his servers from the get go!\n\nNever again.

I arrived at 6:40 on Wednesday after booking it from the flamingo to make it in time for happy hour, only to find that happy hour is extended on Wednesdays- SCORE! \n\nJenny was my waitress and I can't say enough positive things about her- patient, kind, and altogether a nice gal. I got a dragon bite to drink...for 7 bucks, it definitely didn't disappoint- tasty and stout! \n\nI had the tootsy maki, Las Vegas roll, and seaweed salad for dinner. Extremely fast and very tasty. I also had a hot sake- a steal at 3.75 and not too bad. Too bad I didn't have room for dessert. After a quick stroll around fashion show shops, I returned for another sake before my show. Much to my surprise it was covered by the manager since I mentioned I was back for more! The bartender, Jamie, was so friendly and helpful. I will be back again at least once during my five night stay, and will definitely return again if I return to Vegas. Great job, Ra! This spot is a can't miss when trying to dine on a budget while still enjoying fresh, tasty food."

Three items, totaling $22. Most AYCE's around town are in that range, but that's just a sidenote.\n \nRA'kin Shrimp - this was the best out of the three. Lobster egg rolls: no lobster flavor, it was just fried mushy cream cheese logs. The Viva Las Vegas Roll - oh please. Was a faux California roll (only the krab), tempura-fried, with I think what was supposed to be spicy tuna on top, then a tarot slice garnish. Disappointing. I just ate the spicy tuna mix on top, and even with that, I've had much better. I'm used to really good, if not great, sushi. Another disappointing Vegas restaurant experience. Too bad we lost Cafe BaBaReeba. Should have lost RA instead. Ptttht.\n\nGood service earned that one star.\n\nNote: Looks like all the happy hour prices have been upped by a buck since any Yelp reviews you see prior to 2011."

I have become a huge yelp fan only because I feel like people use yelp to just complain about thing's . When in reality I feel like the only reason why I will ever write a review and even bother is to give the place some credit. Im not a big sushi person but my girls are so anytime they want sushi we come here they get sushi and I get miso soup, cucumber kimche and other aps. I absolutely love this place . Everyone is so nice ... the hostesses are always sooo polite . My fav bartender is Francisco he is so much fun. I had a bad waiter once but I asked to get a different server and didn't let him ruin my experience. .. happy hour here is the best !! I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;"

            "review": "For those who understand some Japanese, \"RA\" is also spelled in hiragana to sound like \"raw,\" which is a somewhat clever name for a sushi restaurant.\nToo bad this place is more like \"ME,\" as in \"meh.\" (sorry, apparently the hiragana can't show up on yelp).\n\nThe decor is nice and fancy, but there's an obsession with the color red once you step inside that is really overbearing. The lights are so red it puts such a strain on your eyes that it was painful just to read the menu. Seriously, I felt like I was trapped inside a Nintendo Virtual Boy machine or something. And when the food came out, it didn't even look that appetizing because you can't even tell what you're eating unless you take a picture with flash - then you can appreciate the colors and effort they put into the food's presentation.\n\nI ordered the Viva Las Vegas Roll and Crazy Monkey Roll. The VLV was primarily a crab & cream cheese concoction, with a nice fried lotus root which added a nice crunch. This was good, but after a few pieces, you kind of lose track of the flavor of the seafood which gets overtaken by the other ingredients (a common trait in Americanized sushi). The Crazy Monkey Roll was sweet with the teriyaki sauce glaze and cashews - the sweet and shiny look made it seem like fish baklava. Kinda good, but strangely gross too if you think about it. As for my friends, most had worse luck. Two ordered the same Lobster Shrimp Roll, but one got the short stick as his lobster tasted off ~ it seemed old. Yuck.\n\nAs for the service, it was a mixed bag. Attentive waiters readily refreshing my glass, but the chefs were slow: my CMR came almost 20 minutes after I received my VLV.\n\nOverall, if you like Americanized sushi and a flashy modern settings, then RA might be the place for you. But if you like your eyeballs and actually want to taste your seafood in your sushi, you probably have much better options elsewhere in Vegas for your sushi fix."

RA sushi is to Japanese food as Taco Bell is to Mexican...far from what it's supposed to be. \n\nGet your pre party on here for cheap and get a Las Vegas Roll when you're drunk enough to wanna eat the sushi here.

When my best friend brought me here and I saw there was no AYCE and peculiar menu items with ingredients I'm not really into, I made her walk me to Segundo next door but they were closed.\n\nAlas we went back into RA Sushi and I gave the menus another hopeful glance. Despite the large number of items I would never order without somehow deviating, such as the inclusion of mango in an otherwise delightful sounding tempura roll, I miraculously found two dishes that will for sure bring me back:\n\nThe edamame dip, for starters. I'm a classic edamame lover and when I saw this, I knew I had to give it a try. The chips they provided with it looked a little too few at first so I majorly dipped my first handful and the dip itself was amazing. If you like tart spinach dip with a little bit of a sweet pickle flavour, then I definitely recommend this appetizer. And it turned out I should have been less generous with my first chips because I had chips left over as I was practically scraping the bowl clean!\n\nNext was the calamari tempura roll. When you see it's rotating red and green colouring a from I assume the tempura crumbs, it looks like Christmas! It tasted pretty good, a little bland in flavour just because of the calamari and the cream cheese was a little overwhelming at the same time. It was OK.\n\nI saved Lobster Shrimp Roll for last because it is simply the best. I don't believe I've ever had lobster in my sushi before but the combination of it with shrimp, avocado, crab mix, and rice was AMAZING. I was so impressed by it that I ordered it a second time, I just couldn't help myself!\n\nI did spend a hefty $50 but granted it was a late Friday night with no happy hour but my taste buds justified it so it was well worth it. The service was okay, our server was very nice and polite but didn't bring wasabi for my friends Philadelphia roll and somehow forgot my iced tea would require sugar so we had to flag him down two separate times. Overall, nice atmosphere GREAT food and I wouldn't mind my next trip being soon but cheaper!!"

I guess everything on the menu was an additional $3 since we were straddling lunch / happy hour/ dinner. \n\nThe waitress was like half helping us half flirting with some other customers and dicking around in the back. This totally pissed me off. Just because they worked at the hotels and you were trying to get into some club for tonight or whatever it is - you still have other customers you should attend to! Additionally, It looked like most of the wait staff was on lunch break and they were eating pizza in front or hiding in the back. We got an appetizer and no utensils. We had to ask the busboy to get us some. All the tables around us had cloth napkins but we ended up getting bar napkins and some forks. Wait, he threw in chopsticks for good measure too...\n\nThe icing on the top was when we got the bill. She wrote a big \"THANK YOU! =)\" on the receipt AND circled the \"suggested tip\" section.

Prices for the amount of food received was totally not worth it either. Apparently they have a great happy hour for drinks,and because of that I recommend that they remodel their business into a bar, because I've ate better sushi purchased from the grocery store that sat out all day. Save your money if you have working and functional taste buds. If you love the taste of dirt. Then this is the perfect place for you. Oh I visited place Monday Feb 7th around the happy hour time.

(the bf's family is from hawaii and so is she, so they bonded fairly quickly). everyone ordered a bento, except for me (i ordered the bara chirashi bowl and his dad ordered the viva las vegas roll). food was delicious! the bowl was SO filling! hamachi, salmon and tuna sashimi, rice and avocado. i barely finished it! it was a perfect lunch - simple and satisfying.\n\nvisit #2: his parents had us watch their suite while they were away, and we wanted to go somewhere we could walk to. so - RA happy hour it is! we ordered a tsunami punch (fish bowl was $13 and the baby tsunami punch was $6. we were gonna get 2 anyway, so we opted for the regular price fish bowl). we also ordered short ribs, wings, salmon carpaccio, edamame and seaweed salad. bill was about $40. our server at the bar was awesome as well (tracy). we needed a few boxes and still have quite a bit of our fishbowl left. i think she noticed we were full and the itis was about to kick in, and since its on the strip you're able to take your drink with you in a to-go cup (i had no idea that was possible! im so use to places saying no!). we left there full and completely satisfied.\n\nthanks RA sushi!!!\n\ndefinitely check out happy hour! quite a bit of tapas and rolls available on the menu, and some pretty awesome drink specials too!

My friend waited 10minutes for a refill, then my other friend waited another 10min on top of that! She made it very clear that she didn't care. Then when we received our check, she circled in bold TIP 15%. I mean we believe if you received awesome service, then yeah u deserve that and maybe more, but knowing you gave us bad service and then expecting that, hahaha think again NOPE! \n\nThe food and ambiance is good, HOWEVER the service SUCKS! Because of this experience we won't be going back, NEVER AGAIN. And I'll make sure my friends know about this as well. And btw they got a 1star because of the food."

            "review": "FOOD\nI ordered the assorted vegetable tempura appetizer (came with asparagus, sweet potato, green beans) and the chili ponzu yellowtail roll. The vegetable tempura appetizer was pretty good and they were very generous with the number of pieces they served. The chili ponzu yellowtail roll contained spicy yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, and garlic and was served with a chili ponzu sauce. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce, but they do serve it on the side! The roll itself was pretty standard in taste.\n\nMy friend ordered the Dinner Sashimi Assortment; which I believe came with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and another type of fish along with rice and miso soup! I was so sad that find out that she had found bones in her some pieces of her fish. I know that my friend does enjoy eating sashimi, so I felt super bad that she had to experience those bones while eating. It would totally take away from my dining experience. \n\n\n\nPRICING\nTo be completely honest, I was pretty surprised when my friend and I sat down and looked at the menu. I expected their dishes to cost a lot more as expected on the Strip. However, the prices were pretty average for a sushi place! I believe the vegetable tempura appetizer was about $6 and the yellowtail roll was about $12. \n\n\n\nSERVICE\nThe service here was really attentive. Our server came to check in on us and asked if we needed anything as he passed by our seating area. I am also really glad that the manager gave my friend a discount on her sashimi plate as she had found bones in her fish."

I'm a sucker for the Gojira roll and Boyfriend gets the Viva Las Vegas roll. The appetizers are tasty and the nigiri doesn't seem to disappoint. The tempura-fried ice cream is one of my all-time favorite desserts. However, I'd like a bit more bang for my buck. We know to come here when we're not super hungry, since we can't afford to stuff ourselves here. It's a nice date-night treat though. \n\nSecond, the service: 3 Stars. It definitely leaves something to be desired. It's not that the waitresses are unfriendly; it's more an issue with the timing of the meal. It's not at all uncommon for one diner to have finished their roll before another diner receives theirs. Given that, in my case, all the food is ordered (and should be put into the kitchen) at the same time, it should all come out together. Even a delay of a couple of minutes is fine, but 15-20 minutes? Not acceptable.\n\n*For those of you doing the math and wondering why RA gets 1 star, not the 3.5 star average you'd assume based on the above, read on:\n\nThere is one thing that RA could do to turn this 1 star review into a 4 star one. It's incredibly simple and won't cost them a dime. For the love of all things holy, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN! It's so loud that you have to yell in order to be heard by the person sitting next to you. It's obnoxious and serves no purpose. Loud music is great, but not when you're trying to have a nice dinner and, you know, speak to your dining buddy.\n\nAll in all, despite actually wanting to go back (as I said, date-night treat!), we won't be returning until the music is turned down. It really, really kills what would otherwise be a perfectly wonderful dining experience. RA, please fix!!!"

For all those that think they're in for a treat after shopping at the Fashion Show Mall and craving for Sushi, DON'T BE TEMPTED TO GO TO RA!!  As convenient as it may be being right outside of the mall.  As inviting as it looks to lure you in and come inside.  DON'T DO IT.\n\nRa, please tell us why in the world it takes almost ONE HOUR to get 4 orders of Sushi when we saw 6 sushi chefs behind the bar?  Ok, we understand that it's crowded on New Year's Day which our horrible waitress claimed that was the reason why the pace was slow but seriously, ONE HOUR?  \n\nOur hot food came out before our sushi order did.  Our waitress didn't even have the courtesy to keep us updated on what was going on until we had to ask.  When we did ask all she could say was that it's busy and that \"it's like that every year on New Year's day\"  In our opinion, we've been to much busier restaurants with much friendlier service.  And another thing-- don't you think that if the restaurant knew that every year that New Year's day especially would be busy then maybe they would up the staf coverage for that day?  Hmmm, poor planning on management's part.\n\nThe sushi came out WITHOUT wasabi and ginger, uhmmmm.....pardon us for expecting those things to come with it.  Call me crazy but I just thought that was a GIVEN.  Didn't know you had to ask for wasabi and ginger with Sushi!!\n\nAnd lastly, NOT FRESH and BAD fish.  When one person had a stomach ache afterwards we thought, eh....maybe it was something you ate earlier.  When another had a stomach ache we knew......yep must be the sushi and the bad service at Ra.\n\nOVERPRICED. BAD SERVICE. BAD SUSHI."

We also got a spicy tuna roll for a starter and it was tasty.  For my entree I got the Tuna2 salad which was pretty tasty.  Sooo much raw fish on it, but the ra fish could have been seasoned or something to add a bit more taste.  It was good though.  One friend got the Ultimate Shrimp tempura roll and said it was fine..just decent, and my other friend got the.....i cant find it on the website, but it was a steak roll served with some type of sauce.  We ended up ordering a 2nd roll of that because it was pretty tasty..the meat was a little over cooked, but good with the sauce.\n\nThe service was great and the atmosphere is fun..and the heating lamps on the patio are great :)  To end our dinner my friend ordered the espresso martini and it was sweet but super good and super strong!

The sushi preparer was fine but he gave me a bad piece of Surf Clam (it was half disintegrating/rotting.

We went downstairs toward the thumping loud music coming from the sushi restaurant.  At first we were hesitant to eat here, because the music was seriously loud.  I mean, club level loud.  But we decided to eat here because they had an interesting sounding sushi roll on their menu.. the \"Crazy Monkey\" .  We had to have a crazy monkey.. because monkey is just our thing!  (no, not monkey meat silly people!)\n\nYou have to try this roll!  It was seriously YUMMY!  It was pretty much a philly roll, with avocado on top too.  But the unique this was their mango sauce they drizzle on it.  It was sooooo goooood!  We had already had our fill of drinks for the night, but we also saw someone order a Tsunami Punch... 60 oz of mixture of sake and other hard liquors that I can't remember.  The thing was huge!  for $10!  The table next to us ordered 1 and they had 3 people working on this thing.  Next time, I'm going to have one of these!\n\n***** Update Sept 2007****\n\nWe went back, and I tried the Tsunami Punch.  Sooooo goood!  We shared it between 3 people.

Pretty good, but not great -- it didn't seem like the freshest quality and the texture of the rice was a bit off, like a bit hard maybe?  I do love their menu and the fact that they have such unique rolls, extensive and creative appetizers as well.  The only appetizer I got to try was their calamari, which was thick and yummy, since they were out of their cream cheese pineapple pot stickers.\n\nWhat I really love about this restaurant is the bar!  I definitely recommend going during happy hour and getting drinks and maybe a roll or appetizers.  They have an extensive cocktail menu with plenty of fruity and sweet drinks, martinis, frozen drinks, sake, and even about a dozen flavored bombers. I loved the red white and blue bomb and the lychee saketini.  The unami punch is pretty good but insanely strong! I enjoyed a few other drinks there but I forgot the names!

My cousin and I kept dipping blander rolls with this sauce... \n\nRA'kin Shrimp was my favorite here! Panko-crusted HUGE pieces of juicy shrimp on a bed of greens with a tasty dipping sauce. If I ever come here for happy hour again, I'm gonna order 3 of these and be done with it!\n\nViva Las Vegas Roll had a thinly sliced and fried lotus root on each piece but the cream cheese was so overpowering. Why do we need cream cheese on everything? Ugh. This was alright, but I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese on my rolls to begin with...\n\nShrimp Tempura Roll... meh. Not crunchy at all. Soft and cold shrimp tempura with way too much rice. And it's not even good quality rice.\n\nCrunchy Calamari Roll was alright. Kind of same as the shrimp tempura roll, but this time, you hardly taste calamari and only the cream cheese. Again with the cream cheese! \n\nSpicy Salmon Roll was ok. Chopped up bits of salmon with a nice kick. The rice kind of ruined it, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, great happy hour prices and my cousin and I loved the seared tuna and RA'kin Shrimp. This chain is more Americanized sushi, but on the strip, we can't complain too much. \n\nAt least we were beyond full and ready to party for EDC later that night!"

Per its web site, \"the music is pumping, the mood is upbeat and the atmosphere is as stimulating as a big bite of wasabi.\"\n\n**The Menu\nSushi, plus an assortment of other dishes: teriyaki, noodles, katsu. The sushi emphasis is on rolls with all sorts of stuff mixed in. How about a Viva Las Vegas roll: an artificial crab and cream cheese roll, battered and fried, then topped with spicy tuna, crab mix, and lotus root, THEN topped with bbq sauce and fried spinach flakes.\n\n**The Atmosphere\nThe design is simple, with lots of light wood and a black industrial ceiling. Light is provided by a number of blood red globes. Music, at a moderate volume, consisted mostly of blues and rock.\n\nThe sushi bar is poorly designed. While the sushi chefs try to be friendly, the bar is so deep that it was difficult to be heard over the music. I view this as a major flaw.\n\n**The Meal\nSince this was my first meal here, I opted for some basic sushi choices. They all suffered from a basic flaw: rice that was too soft, and lacked flavor. Not a good start. Now, on to the particulars:\n\n    * hamachi (yellowtail). The fish was fresh enough but, even given the mild nature of hamachi, was bland.\n    * unagi (barbecued eel): The eel was barely warm. The sauce was watery.\n    * flying fish roe with a quail egg: Good. The rich egg flavor and the crunchy roe made the rice's deficiencies less important.\n    * amaebi (raw sweet shrimp): The shrimp were fresh enough, but lacked flavor. On request, the heads are fried. No tempura batter was used, which I thought odd but not bad. The heads were crisp, but overcooked and somewhat dry. Nonetheless, RA Sushi get points for even offering this selection.\n\n**Summary\nThe sushi was very disappointing. Go for the atmosphere. Maybe the more exotic rolls are good. Just don't go for regular sushi.\n\n**The Bill\nThe meal was $44, plus tax and tip."

SO I thought of RA because I knew it wouldn't be overly expensive and Hunnie Bunnie was rollin with us. We got there before happy hour was over, and we were sat in the dining room. I ordered the White Sake Sangria was was very tasty. Angie had her California roll which she seemed to love and we shared some Shishito Peppers and Spicy Sesame Chicken Wings and Edamame. Everything was great! Hunnie Bunnie had some Miso Soup and a big ass bowl of Udon Noodles. The only things is, if the Udon Noodles had BROTH in it, it would have been a little better I think but otherwise, no complaints! \nI used to come here ALL THE WAY waaaaaaaaaaaay back for happy hour - it's a great spot on the strip for some cheap, GOOD eats, and the service was good as well. NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE LIKE IIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!"

There are drink/food items starting at less than $4. They have seating indoors and outdoors, so when it gets nice outside, it's great to be seated right on the Las Vegas strip. \n\nDuring happy hour, which I recall being from 4-7, their hot sake is only $3.75. You can do sake bombs (sake + Kirin) for $8, which is a little pricier than other sushi happy hours I've been to (but not bad for the strip). For food I'd recommend their Shishito peppers (so good when they're spicy) and their Viva Las Vegas roll. Yum! \n\nI've tried their sashimi bowl for lunch before and it wasn't anything special. The sashimi didn't taste very fresh. The service here can also get a little slow when they're busy. You'll be calling the server over rather than having them come check up on you. \n\nOverall, a convenient sushi happy hour if you're already at Fashion Show Mall."

Came in as first timers and tried a few tolls! Forgot the names of them but the fish wasn't as fresh as I usually want to get when I want sushi. Sushi is very easy to cover up with sauces and I feel like for at least the rolls I ordered were full of sauce and just couldn't get the fish to come out of any of the bites I got. Service was great, friendly staff from beggining to end of the visit . Best of all is atmosphere and how nice inside the place is. The decor really gets you going and hits you with high expectation. Unfortunately the prices are very high and of course when you want sushi you expect to pay more than average meals. For their quality fish and such disappointment in how they put so much sauces on their rolls is a disappointment. Not feeling this one unfortunately."

Awful. The rolls were bathing in a sickly sweet candy sauce reminiscent of salad dressing that overpowered all other flavors.\n\nLike most things in Vegas, this meal was fake. However, if you are there for the racous environment and drinks, you might enjoy the atmosphere and very friendly service (for which I gave a second star). Our server was wonderful.

I'm not familiar with sushi...AT ALL, since I don't eat meat that often, but I think my mom ordered sashimi and she LOVED it. Anyways, we also ordered this appetizer which I cant seem to remember, but I want to say it was some sort of...well I dont know what they're called, like a crispy wonton thing. It was good nonetheless, but for some reason I dont remember what it was haha. Since I'm not a big fan of sushi, I decided to be American and order this noodle dish haha it was really gooood! Large portion too and we also ordered a chicken salad which was delicious and huge, as well. I took my noodle dish back to the hotel and stuck it in the mini fridge, it was so good, but the next day when we left Vegas, I forgot about it and left it there! :(\n\nHowever, I just realized there is one back home in Califrnia right next to my house wow!

Happy Hour specials for Sake & Beer (for sake bombs) is a good deal!\n\nSERVICE: BAD FOR GROUPS! The only time I'm here is for group functions. The servers are easily confused. They always run out of shot glasses for sake bombs. They forget to refill waters and drinks.\n\nSPLITTING CHECKS: For large groups, our server made a check for every 3-4 people. Not too difficult. However, for groups over 6 people, gratuity is automatically calculated 20% each check. This is WAY TOO MUCH for these incompetent servers.\n\nFood isn't bad.

You feel like you're in a club though. That's not a bad thing, if you're in the mood. But you should know that I took a close look at the DJ and his turntables were definitely \"compact disc\" turntables rather than vinyl.\n\nI enjoyed watching the patrons of the classier restaurant next door try to ignore the Brooke Hogan remix that was quite obviously blasting their faces off from the other side of the railing. The food was fine, but the service went to hell as I was never able to get my hands on a glass of water and they didn't have my beer after promising they would have it and it took close to 15 minutes to get the bill."

I just feel overwhelmed with their ambiance, and it's not a great feeling.  \n\nNow on their food section, their prices for happy hour isn't too bad.  It ranges from $5 to $7, for sushi and desserts.  I've experienced better sushi, but I didn't mind eating it for the price.  But it's nothing to brag about.  I did like their dessert though, both their fried banana wrapped thing and their Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream was really good.  I thought the waiter was a not the business though, considering she didn't bother to refill our drinks or take our order within the 15mins we sat down.  \n\nIf you're looking for a place that has the club like feel while eating a boat load of sushi, then this is your place."

This isn't your low key, authentic, hole in the wall sushi bar so if that's what you're looking for, it's best to keep moving.\n\nThey have a good happy hour menu from 4-7 with really inexpensive rolls, drinks and apps. I really enjoyed the lobster shrimp roll with asian pesto. The pesto really gave it a different flavor that I quite enjoyed. The wasabi mashed potatoes were also to my liking. I didn't actually have any bad food. Some of it was unmemorable, but perfectly acceptable. \n\nThe only thing I don't recommend is the Banzai martini.

We opted to wait a bit and head over to catch their reverse happy hour (10 pm-close). The interior is nicely dimmed and has a cozy feeling. There was a good vibe in there and thank god it was not noisy and hectic. Getting away from the crazy loud Vegas life to enjoy a meal was refreshing.\n\nOrdered off the happy hour menu. Wasn't too impressed with what I saw on there so I figured I'll go with what I know and keep it decent. From what I saw around my table, rolls were slightly small, my rainbow roll was just okay. The albacore was probably the best dish I sampled. Honestly, nothing was too memorable for me and same goes for my friends.\n\nOn  a good note... service was phenomenal, even hooked me up with a sake on the house. BUT, their idea of a large sake, is weaaaaaakkk. That's a small ass bottle my friend. A quiet, chill, not too stuffed but sorta buzzed evening gives my experience at RA a solid 3 stars."

Well drinks are $3, specialty drinks $4.  There's a happy hour menu which has some rolls and some other appetizers that are all half off.  \n\nFor food, we shared a crispy spicy tuna roll, a viva las vegas roll, the scallop dynamite (appetizer, not roll), and crab cakes.  This came out to $20 which is quite a deal if I don't say so myself!  The crab cakes were great - there's 3 so it was good for sharing.  Crispy Spicy Tuna is sort of strange; it comes on these sesame rice balls that are quite glutinous.  The scallop dynamite is this baked, sizzling hot plate with some mushrooms and creamy sauce.  Good!    \n\nNigiri is also half off (maybe only some kinds), so we tried the salmon and tuna ones.  Two pieces of nigiri for 2.50, not bad.\n\nI had the Pamatini which was kinda pomegranate-ish with other stuff.  It was tasty =) \n\nAll in all, a good place to go for happy hour!"

I don't understand why there are multiple locations throughout Tucson, AZ, but none in the whole state of Colorado.  With that being said, I absolutely love RA.  It is in my top 5 favorite sushi restaurants of all time. They have excellent service, great happy hour prices and amazing sushi.  I have taken someone who didn't even like sushi to try RA,and they became a fan. Literally. Open one in Denver!!!\n\nI always rant and rave about this place. I don't think I can say enough great things.  This time, we stopped in to the Vegas location across from the Wynn Hotel. This location is a bit tough to get to, but well worth the trek. We ordered off the happy hour menu and really couldn't decide, so we actually ordered entirely way too much food. We started with the calamari, which I had never had there.  It was lightly battered in tempura batter.  I would suggest getting this if you are sharing for a table of 4 or more.  The dish was a pretty large portion. It was good, but I am not sure if we would order it again based on the size. It is usually just my fiance and I.  Then we added the shishito peppers, which is one of my all time favs. We have ordered these at other restaurants and no one can replicate these to be anywhere near as great as RA. We then got the egg rolls and the gyoza. Both equally as tasty, just a ton of food. By that time, we should have stopped ordering, but, we needed to get some sushi.  Bring on the yellowtail! Yellowtail is my favorite fish and RA does it right. Soaking in ponzu sauce and topped with jalapenos, this dish will surely make your taste buds tingle. Top it off with more yellowtail and I was set for the day. I seriously just wish that they would open a location in Colorado.  The state will be very happy if they did."

We sat outside and could tell that the party of 9 to our left was taking up all our waitress' time, so she's forgiven.\n\nNext time, I think I'll try the Rainbow roll....yum."

If you are looking for an \"authentic\" Japanese restaurant, this ain't it.  This is more of a Japanese fusion type place, if you're into that.  Unfortunately, I am not.  I like my sushi to be authentic and traditional, not cream cheese mixed with fish.  I also ordered Chicken Terriyaki.  Presentation was beautiful, but my chicken was bland and dry.  Seriously, if you own a Japanese restaurant and you can't make decent Chicken Terriyaki, you should be shot.  This place is not cheap either.  So be prepared to spend a good chunk of change on lousy sushi.  To end on a positive note, the house sake was pretty good."

I got the salmon rice bowl, it was a bunch of salmon sashimi with rice, cucumbers, and a really delicious sauce. I loved it so much and it got full with leftovers, since it's raw fish and I don't trust leaving it in the hotel, it just sucks I can't take it to go unless I eat it quickly *sad face. That first time I got it, it was from the lunch menu, but when I came back a few months later luckily they said they were able to make me it for dinner. Weird how it's something on the lunch menu and not on the dinner though? And when I asked if I still got the miso soup (included on the lunch menu) the second time I came, the waitress told me it shouldn't come with it because at the time it was dinner hours... but it's not on the dinner menu whatsoever, it's on the lunch. I don't know how to explain it. It was just odd to me that whole situation. I told her \"oh okay then.\" Yet she still came back with it after her lowkey attitude for asking.\n\nAs for service, the first time I came the waitress I had was very sweet and super attentive. I got everything I needed to enjoy my meal before heading out to EDC that evening. The second time, I was kind of disappointed because our server literally took a very long time to take our order, to get us water... and when I needed something she was nowhere to be found, for such a long period of time my boyfriend had to ask the busser next to us to get us a side of spicy mayo (thanks dude!). That second server was probably annoyed of me asking for that miso soup earlier lol. I don't even think she was busy because the place was pretty empty when I came in. I will still return hoping to receive the service I got the very first time, hopefully they have less snobby servers in the near future. Otherwise I don't think I can handle it. I would probably just want to take it to go back to my hotel to eat it instead just to avoid having attitude on the side with my meal haha."

Got some roll called tootsy something that had crab, shrimp, that kind of thing -- it was way too sweet -- I guess the crunchies and the eel sauce were too much for me.

The presentation was good, but like someone else stated, it took a while and we were not told as to why or told when it would be out.  When we got the sushi, some of it seemed soft not firm as you would expect from sushi grade fish.  After the fact, I don't know if it was the sushi or the drinks while playing craps at the Wynn but I started to feel not so well.  I can't fault RA, as I drank a fair share, but I never had a reaction like that on any other night.  But this year when we go back to Vegas, we are going to skip RA and try Kabuki's or Sushi Roku."

The view from the patio seating at RA looks directly across the Strip at Wynn.  The music is a bit of a mystery, as RA is located directly beside a mexican restaurant that plays appropriate to theme music that competes with the fresh sounds provided by RA.\n\nThe staff was a mediocre.  They are knowledgeable about their menu, but they aren't exactly going to go out of their way to make sure that you do.

It's a louder, more upbeat sushi bar....a little more swanky and the decor a little more modern, since it is on the strip.  So for ambiance, especially for a bachelorette party...I think it fits the bill.  The food however is not good for the price you are paying.  I ordered the sesame garlic chicken wings...and it was just salty on the outside without any real flavor to the chicken and most chicken wings have a nice crunch on the outside.  I also ordered the sashimi dinner combo with tuna/albacore/salmon/yellowtail.  While the portion is decent....the fish is not fresh....it was hard to eat the tuna/albacore/yellowtail because of how fishy it tasted.  The salmon was decent, but again there is definitely better sushi just down the road on spring mountain.  They do have happy hour, so I say if you want to give this place a try...come during happy hour to test the waters instead of paying full price for mediocre food.  The service was also lack luster, we all got our food at random times and we repeatedly had to ask if our food was still coming.  The only real perk of the restaurant is the ambiance if you have a bachelor or bachelorette party."

Lots of veggies and shrimps in it, the broth was very flavorful and comforting! \n\nRaw things were fresh and tasty, the appetizer hot mess was spicy king crab on crispy rice, it was delicious but just a little too creamy for me, and it was a big plate for myself, left out all the crispy rice, shame on me! \n\nOverall we liked the food so much! They couldn't make a Bloody Mary for me at the moment cause the bartender stepped out for a good 10 minutes, when she came back in she found out they just ran out of Bloody Mary mix... well, I ordered a mimosa instead, it was tasty.  \n\nA decent sushi restaurant at fashion show mall, good spot for lunch, they have TVs in the patio, good for summer nights, and they open till late everyday!"

She was the one bright spot in this shitty shitty experience.\n\nOur actual waiter came out 5 minutes later (25 minutes on the game clock for those following) to take our order. Too late, buddy! A third waiter then brought us water.\n\nAnother 20 minutes went by (45 minutes now) and all of my sushi had come out, but my friend's chicken teriyaki hadn't arrived yet. I flagged down the lazy waiter and rather sternly asked him to track the dish down. It came out another 10 minutes later (55 min) without so much as an apology. \n\nThe menu itself has more rolls with cream cheese on it than any self-respecting sushi place would allow. I got two of the few that didn't and a couple pieces of nigiri, totaling about $40. I ate $40 worth of grocery store grade sushi. And not a good, Asian grocery store, I'm talking about sushi from Ralph's or Safeway.

You can't get a better deal than this on the Las Vegas strip! The restaurant itself has a great modern ambiance. During my early college years, this was the spot on Sunday nights with a DJ by the bar.\n\nFun place to eat and hang with your friends! I rated it a 4. It would've been a 5 if regular prices would be a little cheaper.\n\nLove the RA!"

I went here with a group of girlfriends before seeing the 9:00 showing of Mystere at Treasure Island.  So it was a little on the late side, yet happy hour seemed to be going on and on.  Rolls were well priced and sake was $1 - big mistake for management given my friends' love for sake bombs.  Joe, our friendly hot waiter/kindred spirit fan of Eastbound and Down made fantastic suggestions on the food - though I can't remember the names of the rolls, I enjoyed one with shrimp tempura in it, some mango lobster creation, and another super hot one with jalapenos (I might have been the only one who thought it was super hot).  The atmosphere was pretty cool with lots of red lantern lighting and good music - though I felt like we might have been the only rowdy group there given the Sunday family crowd they had going.  But, delicious sushi, great cocktails, and wonderful service."

Our server took our order for appetizers and drinks and that was the last good or tmely action.  The calamari tempura appetizer was tasty and enough to share.  My daughter ordered edamame but got miso soup (we finally did get the edamame).  We ordered some sashimi (salmon and yellowtail).  Our server said the salmon was super fresh.  Neither appetizer looked or tasted fresh.  The yellowtail was mushy and swimming in wasabi sauce (again, out server told us it was not very spicy when we ordered).  The salmon was likewise, soft and mushy.  We had a lobster and shrimp roll that was mediocre and saturated in what seemed to be mayonnaise....yech!  We ordered a second round of drinks (one beer and two wines) which didn't come until we had finished the meal.  One order of sashimi never came and our server had to be reminded...he finally brought it when we were ready for our check.  During the evening, we had a difficult time finding our server....we finally asked another server to locate him.  This happened three times during the 90 minutes we were there.  My beer was served in the bottle with the label still partially wrapped around the neck (Stella Artois) instead of offering me a glass.\n\nThis was NOT the Ra experience we had in San Diego and we heartily recommend that you find a different sushi/sashimi restaurant when you're in Las Vegas."

Ra Sushi is one of the few places I can talk him into going to because they have dishes that he will actually enjoy, not just tolerate so that I can gorge on some raw fish...\n\nUsually when I go to Ra it is for lunch. I typically get the sashimi combo for $11... it is 4 pieces each of tuna, salmon and yellowtail and comes with a bowl of rice and miso soup. He always gets the chicken bento box for $8... it comes with miso soup, rice, salad, gyoza and a spring roll. $20 and we both leave full and happy... \n\nI had dinner with Dawn C. last night at Ra Sushi, we had: \n\nPineapple Cheese Wontons - In a word, amazing. \nGrilled Short Ribs - Tasty but I thought they a bit skimpy on the meat, however they are served with wasabi mashed potatoes, very tasty\nSeared Tuna - Served with a tasty soy based sauce\nViva Las Vegas Roll - One of the specialties at Ra \n\nNo drinks, and the total was just under $40. Not bad for a dinner on the Strip. \n\nRa is beautifully decorated and service is usually good, although like most places the busier it gets the slower service becomes.

You can have dinner with cocktails, eat too much and hit up the bar for a beer on your way out. It's sexy with all those red lanterns hanging about but hell, it's Vegas and that's to be expected.\n\nIt's centrally located in the Fashion Show Mall so you could make a day of it to avoid the heat.  Shop a bit, and take a cab back to your hotel for a nap with no trouble.

The sushi is consistently fresh and tasty. Don't be fooled by the fact that this restaurant is located at the Fashion Show Mall, this is definitely not a \"food-court\" experience.

Every given trip we hit up RA at least once, if not more. And we have been frequenting this spot for over 5 years!\n\nTracy at the bar is hands down one of the sweetest, most genuine girls I've ever had the pleasure to meet. She is on top of her game as a server and makes a killer sake-tini! \n\nTheir happy hour menu has a variety of awesome rolls, salads, gyoza, skewers and a variety of drinks. Everything from classic cocktails, to beer and wine. \n\nThis might sound strange, but the veggie roll is out of this world. I am a seafood lover, however I always order at least one veggie roll. I'll be honest the only reason I even stumbled across this roll was when I was eating with a vegetarian friend. She ordered it and when it came out, it just looked too good. \n\nSpicy yellowtail, and salmon are my all time favs. \n\nI don't usually do the fancy rolls however, my husband loves their Vegas roll. \n\nI can't wait for my next trip back! Thanks for always being so awesome RA. My friends and I always look forward to your wonderful food and service!"

It was pretty slow, and we were able to snag a two top on the patio for some prime people watching. Our server was prompt and friendly without being overbearing. Even though it was slow, our sushi order took about 20-30 minutes to come out. We had a few drinks and didn't really mind the wait, but our server brought us some free edamame anyways. I've been to a few different Ra restaurants in the Phoenix area, but this was by far the best experience. \n\nReverse happy hour runs from 10-close during the week. There were dozens of drinks and food options on the menu, ranging from $2.75-7.75 per item. We had some pretty standard rolls (spicy salmon, shrimp, yellowtail). They weren't anything mind blowing, but hit the spot and were decently priced. The yakitori chicken came with three skewers; the teriyaki sauce was bland, and the meat was a little tough. Same for the seared ahi tapas.\n\nBottom line: our bill came to just under $50 on 5 items, two vodka drinks and two bud lights. Not the place for sushi connoisseurs, but a good inexpensive alternative to pricey restaurants on the strip. The people watching is superb."

Confused, I walked inside anyways.  The wait for a table of 7 was an hour.  Some of us decided to wait at the bar, and the hostess was nice enough to find me and frequently tell me how much longer the wait would be (which was longer than said hour).\n\nThe one thing that saves this review is the TSUNAMI PUNCH.  It comes in a glass that's as big as my head.  It's a 60oz blend of sake, SoCo, Amaretto, vodka, juices....my goodness.  Please believe me when I say that you should share this with a friend or two!"

We also ordered teriyaki chicken, vegetables were yummy but the chicken was dry."

The rolls aren't that great. I will tell you what is because I'm a heffa like that and tried just about everything on the happy hour menu. \n\nGet multiple orders of the sesame wings. That was the favorite dish at our table. Big, succulent wings that were a little crispy just how I like them. And that sesame sauce was so good we took some to go with our leftovers. Another favorite was the fried shrimp, calamari and albacore sashimi. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was just ok. I would also forgo the short ribs. They were NOT good.\n\nIf you're looking for a dinner destination before going out to the clubs, this is a good place for something fun, cheap, easy and light (you can't get too stuffed before you put your freakum dresses on 'kna mean?)."

Great environment and friendly staff. \n\nThe Viva Vegas roll is hands down the best tasting sushi roll I have ever had. No other imitations from other restaurants live up to it.\n\nI have had many different types of sushi here over the years and have not been turned off by any of them, and I'm picky when it comes to sushi. They are all very good. \n\nIf you are looking for All You Can Eat then look elsewhere as it is not offered. However, they do have an excellent Happy Hour around lunchtime with excellent offerings including the Viva Vegas Roll which is a rather filling.\n\nMy number one go-to place for sushi."

I could clearly see the restaurant was NOT busy but for some reason she had a hard time finding us a table. After 15 minutes go by, we finally were sat down. I could barely read the menu because it was so dark. I had to use the flashlight on my phone just to see what was there. Our waiter was probably the only good thing that we experienced. The food was pricey for sub quality sushi. The saki tasted like spiked water. Just an overall disappointing experience. There are other Japanese restaurants you can go to in Vegas. I wouldn't recommend coming here."

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess who sat us right away. The decor was dark and mysterious with glows of red all around. We were sat in a comfortable booth and promptly greeted by our server. I forget her name but she was nice. \n\nWhenever my cousins and I go out to eat, we EAT. By this I mean, our eyes were definitely hungrier than our stomachs. \n\nWe ordered all types of food, from the small plates (albacore onion or something or another, tuna salsa, a micro green salad of some sort, seaweed salad) which were ALL DELICIOUS, to a chicken bowl and sushi. We also ordered some sushi rolls which were bland and tasteless and obviously not their specialty. One of my cousins also ordered the sesame chicken, which we did not even touch. \n\nWe did order 3 of the Chirashi bowls. Oh boy, HAND DOWN, my favorite sushi thing EVER!!! It wasn't your typical chirashi bowl with sushi rice topped with sashimi. There was an amazing vinaigrette, tangy and complimented the fresh fish, and wakame (seaweed salad) throughout. We demolished the bowls and wanted to order more to go but sushi and the unforgiving Sin City sun was nothing to mess around with.\n\nI will definitely be returning the next time I am in Sin City."

So I have been to a couple of the other locations in different cities including Atlanta where I use to live and I have never received the type of service that was exhibited today! For starters let's talk about how excited I was to actually eat here and how that excitement quickly turned into a \"sorry I even bothered situation\"\n\nI had some girlfriends visiting from out of town and they were in the mood for drinks and sushi and suggested that since we were already meeting at Fashion Show Mall to of course try RA! Upon being seated I was greeted by a friendly waiter and had our tables order taken shortly after that. Turns out it was happy hour and we didn't even know it so we all ordered a round of drinks! 1 strawberry patron margarita..1 cucumber and lastly my traditional! After one sip I literally gagged because I said to myself \"there's no way in hell this is a patron margarita\" my friend said the same about hers.. Completely watered down and just not how that particular drink should taste! Here's the thing as a drinker that has a drink of some sort on the regular your taste buds know how it should be.. Today that wasn't the case.. Asked for a new drink and I kid you NOT it took a whole 15-20 for my newly made drink and at this point I was beyond livid that my food hadn't even came but yet my friends were more than halfway done with theirs and I'm sitting there flabbergasted! Really? Like our waiter had nothing to say other than he was sorry.. The bartender had to be new or was just that awful on not only her pour on the drinks but just in general. My problem is that they weren't even busy.. Not that that would make a difference but I'm trying to give the benefit of doubt.. \n\nWhile we were wrapping up the manager Dave comes by to ask how everything was. Hmm of course I explained everything to him that I just typed above and let him know that this was completely out of the standards that I had for RA! He simply responded with \"well I'm sorry but that's illegal to water the drinks down and I'm sorry you had the experience..here is a free appetizer card for the next visit..bye\" like really? Oh and then they thought that just taking $4 off those late ass margaritas they served us was going to be a peace offering? No thanks! I will never go out of my way to be back and take a chance on being bamboozled again.. Super disappointed with the lack of professionalism and just the approach that he took as a manager. What ever happened to looking the part? He strolled up in some jeans an oversized flannel shirt with his monotone nonchalant tone. Yeah I can't...and I won't..."
