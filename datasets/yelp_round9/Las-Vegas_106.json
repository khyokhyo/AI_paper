I've had my crab cravings in the past, and I'd call around the buffets in vegas (Bacchanal, wicked spoon) to ask if they specifically serve snow crabs. Why pay $40-$50 when all i want to do is get my mulah's deal worth on some crab action.\n\n4pm-10p.m. only on Fridays. I came here around 5:00p.m., thinking that there'd be a line, but no, it was a shoe-in. Service was quick, waters were constantly filled, and the crabbies were loaded on my plate. You get two sides included (which isn't AYCE). I highly recommend the SWEET POTATO WAFFLE FRIES. Probably the best I've ever had in my LYFE, SON! \n\nThe french fries, mashed potatoes were average, and the fresh chips were really good. I just ate off of other people's plates, hence I got to try my medley of sides. \n\nI was stuffed by the end of the night. They also had some cookies that they sell Subway style by the cashier. I like my oatmeal cookies so it was yummy for my dessert. \n\nI'll definitely be back to fill my snow crab cravings!"

Every time in Vegas I NEED to eat here or somewhere that has steak and eggs because it almost feels like tradition.  If I didn't it'd be taboo or something and my weekend wouldn't receive a blessing haha jk I'm just being a dork.  The service is always good and my boyfriend says that he feels like the steaks are shrinking in size or getting thinner, but $5 food is $5 food and I'm not complaining!"

Marilyn's Cafe is definitely brighter and nicer in ambiance.  However, the potatoes from Ellis was better; and the beer at Ellis was cheaper too!\n\nOur server was friendly and food came out quickly.  Check out both places and decide for yourself."

Literally after coming from a club it's the best place to enjoy delicious hot meal. \n\nThey ask you how you want your steak and how you want your eggs. Yum!!! \n\nThe waiters are so nice and so helpful....

The fact that the breakfast was tasty and excellent gives them another star.\n\nI tried their sausage Benedict with grits, it came with a biscuit and gravy and some hash browns.  Firstly, very large portion, you can't leave hungry.  I wasn't too big on the grits but the rest was so tasty I wish I had room for more.\n\nAnd the coffee?  Well this is the USA....so it was excellent.  Rich, strong and tasty, what a treat from the Canadian brown water we are subjected to.  Maybe this is why I travel the US so frequently, I love the quality of food.\n\nAnd the prices...unbelievable.  Starting at $3.99 for endless pancakes.\n\nMy meal with coffee came to $10.00.\n\nOther bonuses...free wi-fi, nearby casino, nearby patio = heaven!\n\nWill come back for sure!"

I must have had four grilled cheese sandwiches over the course of the weekend, each time with mashed potatoes and gravy so I could dip each bite of that buttery-ass sandwich into the gravy. I also had the fish and chips, though ALSO with mashed potatoes and gravy, as well as green beans, which, God bless Marilyn's Cafe, had bits of bacon in it. And grease.\n\nService was snappy and friendly, even when the place was packed to the gills with geriatrics and hungry drunks. They made a minor error with a to go order but quickly resolved it.\n\nEven if I don't stay at Tuscany again, I think I'd still consider eating every meal here."

I assume due to the deal. It was decent for what it is. I would recommend getting the steak rare. I usually eat my steaks medium rare, but you know with these random cafes. Also if you like your hashbrowns crispy, get well done and they cook it on both sides. Yummy."

Agree with some other reviewers here, the cole slaw is the best of the sides.  Breakfast another day was the French Toast plate, OK but I asked for all bacon and got bacon and sausages... and the coffee was nothing special.  Portion size was ample but not overwhelming, best value when using 1/2 off coupons."

This time I made sure to request to be seated in my top choices of servers' area (I know them by name since I go there a lot). What I conclude is that  one time was a fluke but if it was my first experience I would've never gone back.  Anyway, all is good after I make the precaution of where to sit. \n\nFood: as great as usual so here's a general list of things that I have ordered before.\n\nCoffee: The most important thing during breakfast - awesome. I'm not sure where they get the beans but IMO, it's better than Einstein's Bagels selection and it's better then Egg Works. Not that the other 2 is bad, I just like this coffee more.\n\nSteak and Egg breakfast special: One of the best choice you can ask for if you are a steak fan. Every time I have ordered it it's made to perfection of the medium rare. The steak is lightly seasons so some people may want to add more. I've never been a fan of hash brown but this place makes it good. You get a choice of pancakes or toast.\n\nMarilyn Starter: No way a person can get it wrong. Generic breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon and pancakes. Ordered it a few times but only once that they over did the salt.\n\nGrits - just right consistency. Great with butter and adding a bit of salt. \n\nCountry Fried Steak: First time having CFS. Steak was moist and the batter was good. Would recommend.\n\nQuiche: I had one with ham, pepper and onions and it came with a fruit cup. Probably the only thing I have ever gotten that I didn't really like. I was not a fan of the crust.\n\nSweet Potato Waffle Fries: A-mazing! Partial bias because by default I love anything with sweet potato. Still awesome to try.\n\nBiscuits and gravy: Was a bit cold when I got the plate. Gravy is not bad but I think it would be better if it had some bits of sausages in there or just something else to add on the mushy texture.\n\nCountry Sausage Lovers Bowl: Aside from food coma in the middle of eating i. it's really good. Heaviest meal I've ever gotten from here. For $9 it fed me for 2 meals. \n\nGrilled Chicken & Eggs: Usually a gamble when it comes to chicken but the chef had chicken breast moist and tender and lightly seasoned.\n\nOverall: Just give this place a try, you can't go wrong."

It's remodeled since I've been here and for a minute I thought I'm at the wrong place. \nMarilyn's Cafe is very nice. I didn't expect servers with ties. Anyways,  I ordered the T-bone dinner ($16.99) and added half a Caesar salad ($2.99). It was pretty good.

The prices are an ode to old school Vegas back when awesome food specials would draw you into random hotels. Perfect for after the club \"sober me up\" delectables.\n\nTHE BAD: The wait!!!  Oh my goodness!  You'd better have plenty of time to spare cause you'll have 3 major waits to deal with. First off its not on the strip, Second you'll wait a while to be seated and finally you'll wait a longer while to actually get your food.  I believe the long waits puts an unnecessary additional amount of pressure on the taste of the food.  We wanted Steak and Eggs and Yelped this place specifically for that reason.  Sadly the steak was REALLY tough and the hash browns were bland and uneventful. \n\nALL IN ALL: Gets the job done but not at all memorable! Again it was probably the long wait that hurt the taste so I gave this place an additional star. With all that said I'd definitely go back at some random hour with less expectations."

They are located within the Tuscany Hotel and Casino on Flamingo Ave off the Strip.  When I arrived at 4 30 am, it was very empty.  Table seating was instant and so was the table service.  I had ordered the \"Big Winner\" and it called that because it is a big breakfast!  2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, ham steak, toast or grits AND 2 pancakes!  Just what I needed because we all know the airlines don't serve food anymore.  The price was very reasonable for the amount of food and it was NOT a late night special.  It is on their regular menu."

I can't remember her name, but our server was one the best servers I've ever had...and I'm not just saying that because she was cute.  The party in my table came one after another so we all ordered separately.  Our server didn't mind at all coming a multitude of times to take orders and run the food.  She was the best!  The other servers during that time slot rock also.  As for the food, surprisingly the cut of the steak isn't that bad.  I only had to slice off a bit of fat strip on the end, but after that the steak was pretty good.  On the down side, this cafe doesn't have A1 steak sauce.  They have Lea & Perrins which is sweeter, kinda ketchupie, but it isn't A1.  Pancakes were delicious and plentiful.  So plentiful I shared half my stack with my little niece.  Can't wait to come back in Christmas time to take advantage of their $3.99 steak and eggs!"

WOW $4.99 for steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast that is such a great deal! It took awhile for the food to come out but oh well it was worth the wait! I was a bit bummed that my steak was more on the almost well done side than medium-well. All our steaks were not all correctly cooked to what we wanted but hey it was only $4.99 and it's late so maybe the cooks were tired too lol Definitely a spot to hit up for some late night grubbin!"

(why me when I seen others getting the legs) The claws were so hard to open I even spilled over the tealight trying to fight with the claw.\n  I asked the waitress can she give me more legs because it is difficult for me to open these hard claws.  The waitress was gone for a while and servicing others because it was quit busy in there due to the all you can eat crab legs.  When she would return she was always nice to me but she said, one thing and that this is all they have.  I was so disappointed due to I seen alot of folks with the legs.  So i order some prime rib taquitos.  (not good to me) \n\n There was this one lady who seemed as if she was a \"busboy\"  always coming around asking can she get you anything and she is so happy to serve and help you. She did that a few times.  I thought How cool was she. I should have asked her to get me the legs.  I DON'T EAT CLAWS. LOL"

A couple days ago I started craving a Mouth watering grilled steak. I ordered one from my hotels room service.... I almost cried. Such a waste of $40. If you've been or are pregnant, you know that craving will NOT go away until that spot is hit perfectly. tonight I decided to walk next door and give their cafe a go after hearing the food was decent. To my surprise- it was amazingly more then I would have ever expected for $14. Perfectly cooked meal, extremely friendly staff (thank you Rueben!) and desert decedent enough for the most lavish bakeries.  \n  All in all. I highly recommend if in the area. More then worth the price and great staff. I'll be back for sure."

Right away less than 10 mins after getting our food I told the front cashier since our server was no where in sight after waiting 10 mins more she came to our table. I showed her the hair and she did not apologize but asked if I wanted something else (obviously I said no) and she walked away. Me and my friend sat there for 15 mins and decided to just leave. We walked outside and security came after us. I explained what happen and they said I had to speak with the manager. When we asked if the manager could come outside so it wouldn't cause us an embarrassing scene they threaten to call the police repeatedly. We went back inside. The manager was not waiting for us. It was the waitress with our check telling me that we walked out on our bill and I put my own hair into my food.  I told her my plate was barely touched. My hair is very long and black and my friends hair is very curly long and brown. The hair is pretty short, it was found under my steak and it had the root on it. This is why I was sure it was not my own hair. After accusing me the waitress walked away and I had to ASK a manager be called. I ASKED the cashier to call the police since my food was tampered with but he stated they could not call the police we would have to (after we were threaten several times that they would call on us). The manager arrived and wasn't told that a hair was in my food or that I notified two people before we left. He had to go find the waitress and confirm that information. He returned and told me no one in the back has long hair. At that point I asked him to look at the plate with the hair on it. He immediately looked at the hair and the food that was completely untouched and apologized and told us the bill is covered. We demanded security stop following us. It was a horrible experience. The customer service was terrible. If they sent security after us then a manager should have been notified, if a guest complains a hair is in the food a manager should be notified. I should not have been left at a table for 15 mins with no indication that the waitress would return nor resolution. It is poor customer service. Disrespectful to patrons. I will NEVER go to this place again. I will let everyone I know travelling to Vegas this year not to go here."

The staff was on point. While one hostess was helping a customer paying the bill at the register, another one saw us to get us seated at a table. They seem to work well together noticing when refills were needed for beverages. I like that my chicken and waffles were tenders. It's been slightly annoying for me as of late to have to pick apart the chicken from bones. I am pretty sure that if I come back to Vegas again I would definitely stop in here for another meal.

Prices keep increasing every time I come (it was like $3.99 back then but now it's $5.99), but it is still the best late-night steak and eggs in town. Note, this pricing only applies after 1am or something super late like that, but hey, it's perfect for those after-clubbing munchies. I've never ordered anything else here.\n\nMy steak is always cooked perfectly medium rare. The one at Ellis Island is always overdone. I get my eggs sunny side up with runny yolk. Sourdough toast, which they spread melted butter all over. You don't even need the jam that they give you. And then hash browns to round it all out. Some places give you fried potatoes, which is just not the same. \n\nLocated inside Tuscany Suites, which is only a few blocks away from the Strip. Open 24 hours, for obvious reasons. Never a wait. Seriously can't beat that!"

(Because the performers at the rat pack is back we're different than the ones that I thought I was getting you could sing on key.)\n\nI asked what do you do for birthdays and they said oh we do nothing. Marilyn's doesn't have one dessert listed on their menu and I asked pacifically bring me something cake or something with a candle they couldn't even do that!\nFinally, after having the most un-festive birthday I ever paid for in history, I went back to Marilyn's  at one of the morning and the manager on duty found a massive dessert platter and put a candle on it and she sang happy birthday to me.\n Why the hell couldnt they have done that when they were supposed to?\n Why was I told they don't do anything for birthdays, no cake,  no ice cream etc?"

It's just located around the corner from Ellis Island Hotel & Casino, another gem of a place for good and bargain eats. \n\nMarilyn's Cafe is open for 24 hours and they have a daily special from 4PM - 10PM ranging in price from $7.99 to $18.99. Check out their menu here: http://www.tuscanylv.com/d/tuscany/media/PDF/marilyn_menu/marilynmenu.pdf\n\nHowever...there's another special menu from midnight to 5AM. Yes, the special and staple that's ubiquitous of Vegas - The Steak & Eggs. \n\nHow much? $4.99\n\nThat's more than a bargain; that's a Willie Mays steal of 2nd base without a throw from the Catcher kind of steal. You get an 8 oz. of juicy, delicious steak and eggs cooked to order. These steaks ain't the cheap kind they serve in Reno for the same price. It's a good-sized piece of steak that's tender, meaty and flavorful. Don't expect a cheap steak for a cheap price, but it was pretty decent quality for the right price. \n\nThey also have an All-You-Can-Eat pancake for $3.99 for their midnight special. I'd have to say that's a lot of carbs for me, but it's there should you get the munchies. \n\nAnd I have to add that service was impeccable. I forgot our server's name, but he was a nice gentleman that was well seasoned. By that I mean experience and class. Servers from other fine-dining establishments could learn a thing or two from him. He made us feel at home, comfortable and relaxed. \n\nSo the next time your in Vegas and hungry and starvin' like a broke-ass college student, don't run to the border or any closest fast food joint on every corner. Get some quality instead and your stomach and wallet will thank me for it."

The steak was cooked well with larger portions compared to Bill's, hash was delicious, and the best part was that Marilyn's had A1 sauce (YESSS!!). A cheaper quality steak without A1 sauce is just not amazing to me. \n\nI truly believe that Marilyn's renovation did nothing but benefit them. The food quality has improved leaps and bounds and the dining area is spacious enough for late night dining and extremely clean. \n\nAlso, I went here three times in the 9 days I was in Las Vegas during this past summer and I always had the same waiter. I wish I remembered his name because he was such a sweetheart. He was peppy at three in the morning and was extremely polite. He made the experience even better!\n\nI am confident enough to brush off my prior statements of the Steak and Eggs at Bill's being better than Tuscany. Fellow Yelpers, Marilyn's Cafe for Steak and Eggs is the way to go! You wont regret it!"

So when I checked on Yelp I figured it was Tuscany Gardens, which has some really good reviews. Big surprise when it turned out to be Marilyn's Cafe.  It's an effin' coffee shop!  No atmosphere, unless you like the \"ambience\" of a tired coffee shop.  And lots of people who can't talk in a normal tone of voice, along with shrieking children.  And a waiter (not ours) who goes to clear the vacated table next to us, finds no tip, and SLAMS the hard plastic drink card onto the table loud enough to make me jump out of my seat.\n\nTo further compound the misery, it was my birthday.  We weren't here to celebrate it, gawd no, but needed a quick bite to eat before an 8:00 pm Lionel Richie concert at PH, so we were captive.  \n\nHaving said all the negative stuff, I had a Reuben, and it was genuinely good.  I hate it when I order a grilled sandwich and it's floppy and ungrilled, but it actually was perfectly done.  The table had the usual condiments, but I like deli mustard on a deli sandwich.  When I asked if they had it, the waiter brought me a cup of a very drippy Dijon.  Not quite what I had in mind, but it was better than yellow mustard.  I can't remember what my husband ordered, but just as before, he liked it a lot.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, and if we're ever in the same circumstance, I might consider coming back.  The sandwich was that good.  But I'll bring my own mustard."

Steak that isn't too bad as long as it's not overcooked! \n\nI would come back all day any day I feel like have a cheap decent meal.... & honestly... wouldn't really care if I got bad service... you are getting McDonald's price for quality food! =]"

This is where all the bad people who do really, really horrible things are forced to go after they die.  Trust me.  As a person with 26 years of management experience in all manner of retail and restaurant, I can tell you that this place is falling apart and has lost its bearings at ALL levels.  The food comes out cold and with the attitude of \"I have been under a heat lamp for 7 hours, dear God please help me!\"  I have been here once and already know that their mantra is \"we can't do that, sorry we can't do that, sorry you can't do that No NO NO.\"  This is the complete opposite of customer service.  Want some specifics?  Okay:  Breakfast for Dinner?  Eggs cold and mixed with what appears to be Rico's Nacho Cheese from a 1985 General Cinema theatre.  Sausage out so long it has a hard outer shell like an armadillo.  Vanilla Milkshake that has all the right ingredients - milk, ice cream - but they aren't mixed up right, so you basically have 2 balls of ice cream floating in milk.  Nice try to deconstruct that dish my friends!  Pancakes were ok.  Hashbrowns were ok - ketchup can cover up all manner of sin.  My son ordered that awesome \"milk float\" and it took over an hour to finally get the thing.  He said, \"Dad it doesn't taste good, but I am SO thirsty!\" and promptly drank it.  I tried it.  Yep, ice cream in milk without being mixed.  We saw our waitress whenever she wasn't helping the other three hundred guests.  The drink guy understood a few words.  He made it with the water a couple of times.  Then we asked for separate checks and the waitress told us we could pay separately at the counter.  Then we were told they don't do that.  That would be ten times were couldn't do something.  The customer is always wrong at Marilyn's.  After a long discussion and working our way up the chain of command the manager, the wonderfully non-delightful Dana gave up arguing with us and told us flatly \"we will not separate your checks, just pay.\"  I gotta tell you, I've never been arrested for a thing, but I really did want to just walk away without paying.  I wouldn't even use my card because I don't trust this place enough to give them any information.  And that is ok, because they will never be getting another penny from me.  The casino either.  Oh, and did I mention I have some pull, some blogs and some juice here in the Valley?  Yeah, word of mouth is gonna grip tight on this one.  I guarantee it.  Go at your peril dear friends.  Better yet, get better service and some decent breakfast food just up the Strip . . . at Denny's."

And let's face it--every cheap breakfast place you've stopped at is probably horrifyingly average.\n\nAMBIANCE: 3 - The Cafe, or at least the inside seemed out of place. The Tuscany looks like a classy casino, until you step into the cafe, where it seems a bit worn down and old. However, it was very spacious inside and they try to sit everyone at booths since not a ton of people come visit them! \n\nSERVICE: 4 - Our waiter was really friendly and fast at servicing us. Our food came out quick--I know, how can it not?! It's steak and eggs!--and they left us alone for the most part except to refill drinks. \n\nFOOD: 3 - Word to the wise: Alert! Alert! BYOW. Bring Your Own Water. The water I had was nasty. I would strongly suggest some bottled water, or maybe you could get a soda! My steak and hash browns  were okay, as long as I had it with steak sauce! Don't get me wrong, the steak was big and juicy, there was just something off with the taste.  The eggs were good! I usually order either scrambled or over easy with cheese. \n\nFun Facts: Their jelly that goes with their Toast is Heinz jelly instead of Smuckers! It's way, way better. \n\nTimes were fun, MC.

One friend had a nice scoop of it nicely on a plate, while I had mines scattered and half the size of his portion. My other friend had only more than half of my size of rice and it looked like the rice was old and leftover. They tried to trick us is into thinking all the rice was the same by not arranging it into a scoop like my one friend. \n\nService 6/10- We came here after an event.

I use to love the AYCE crab dinner here because the crab was so warm and juicy. This time the crab was just room temperature and the sides were just blah.The only thing that improved was that they now put their butter on burners, so it never solidifies. The thing I hate the most was that they raised the Crab Dinner price to $15.99 (drink not included)!! That's 3 bucks more than when I use to come here not too long ago. That's a big difference. For just a few bucks more than that I can go to a seafood buffet with unlimited drinks. I don't think I'll be coming here again for the ayce crab dinner. It's no longer a great value."

I can't expect big time stuff from this 24hour cafe. I ordered the French toast with eggs, hash browns and cheesy grits for all under $11. You can't really mess up basic breakfast so if a place does, then it really must not be good. French toast portion was 3 huge Texas toasts and they were fluffy, comes with the standard powders sugar and butter. My eggs were scrambled well and my hash browns had decent seasoning and golden brown. The grits were cooked well and had good texture to it. They put grated cheese on top just the way I like it. It could've used more salt, but hey that's preference. Good cheap breakfast right off the strip close to flamingo and koval."

It's nothing to write home about.\nOur waitress was really nice and attentive. She even had a great personality and was funny. She made it a better experience than it would have been otherwise (+1 star).\nThe music and sound of the nearby casino is the major downfall. It's in the \"Tuscany\" and they have pop music on. If that odd mix of genre isn't enough, there is a slot machine that plays western ompa polka music about every 30 seconds and it's louder than the pop music.\nOverall it's a good cheap breakfast."

Yes, if I don't have to wait more than 30 minutes to get to my food.  \n\nI will suggest Sear's Fine Foods in Union Square as an alternative.

I get my side of rice of course to eat with my eggs. The perfect meal to end a night.\n\nI honesty don't even know where this place is even located in Vegas, I just get in the cab and tell the driver Tuscany steak and eggs haha. The $5 deal I believe is late night only.\n\nThis place can be filled with lots of drunk people in the early morning but that's okay - the food is what matters :)"

This is far from a hole-in-the-wall establishment; this is a \"I want a sit-down dinner for less than $10 a person.\" The menu is your standard casino cafe fair: breakfast, lunch, dinner.\n\n I made the regretful choice of picking dinner (I really love breakfast food). I opted for chicken cordon bleu with a side of mac and cheese and broccoli. I had my doubts about ordering the chicken cordon bleu and I really should have stayed away  and stuck with breakfast. I'm 85% sure my entree was fried along side my friend's chicken tenders. I could hold the chicken breast in my hand and it wouldn't fall apart. The mac n cheese wasn't anything special and the broccoli was standard. \n\nDespite an uneventful dinner, we still ordered dessert. We knew what we were getting into defrosted dessert pies. They were about $5 each and didn't taste the price. The dessert was $3 less than the entree. \n\nOverall, if I was stuck in the area again and wanted a cheap meal, I'd probably go back. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."

The $4 steak and eggs here are as good as it gets. It definitely satisfies your drunchies - it comes with toast and hash browns too! I've also tried the chicken pot pie, but it's $7 and still not as good as the steak & eggs. I've never had to wait in line, but then again I only come here around 2-4 AM. Every single time, we see a certain waiter - James - and he is the absolute best! I don't know how he manages to stay to happy and friendly and perky at 4 AM to all of us drunkards. I will be coming back again, and again, and again, every time I come to Vegas, and each time with new friends, so long as there are $4 steak and eggs here. This place is an essential part of all my Las Vegas memories."

Although this place is a little far ways from the strip(you'd probably have to drive/cab here) but it was so worth it! I came with my boyfriend and my friend and her boyfriend on a Tuesday afternoon after the advertised deals. But our waitress was SO nice to us. She was friendly, she joked with us, and she hooked it up! \n\nInstead of paying $12.99 for New York steak and eggs, she let us have it for the special price of $6.99 even though it was 3:30pm before any of the deals started. My boyfriend and I both got this deal and it was worth the out of way trip here! The steak was nice and tender and I can't complain for the price! The servings were generous, and the buttered toast was to DIE for (: My mimosa was originally $6.95 I believe but the bill showed it to be $5, so she definitely hooked that up too! It was just the right amount of bubbly! The meal total came out to be about $20, which I think is a really good deal!\n\nI heard that there's a $3.99 deal for steak and eggs between 12am-6am so I'll definitely come back for that the next time I'm in vegas! Good food, even better prices, and amazing service !"

The atmosphere can be for casual or romantic occasions but, as far as I've noticed, a lot of people eat there after partying so expect a few energetic crowds. That could be because I always arrive at odd hours after clubbing or raving--anywhere from 3-6am. The decor is warm, the furniture placement is spacious, and the whole setting is inviting coupled with some of the best service experience I've had. With the right friends, this place is perfect. I remember a couple years back, after my friends and I drunkenly collected handful of escort cards walking down The Strip, we played our own version of 21 with the cards and the staff didn't bat an eyelash. The waiters and waitresses are very charming and friendly. Once, they even warmed up food I got from Earl's Sandwiches. Ask for something nicely and they'll return in kind. So overall, the staff and environment is really great.\n\nTheir menu is so vast--spanning at a whopping 127 total entree choices for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner (~40 each; not including beverages)--yet they don't lose the quality of their food and their portions are very generous. Each entree comes with your choice of bread and butter or jam. They gave me enough (delicious) baked ziti to last me a couple of days. I've also had their vegetarian omelet a few times which was a little more bland than I would have liked but, luckily for me, I like dousing my omelets in spicy sauces or dip it in ketchup so it tasted just perfect. My friends always, always, always order their Steak and Eggs which I would recommend for anyone who loves Vegas' meaty breakfast foods at affordable prices--sometimes they have Daily specials for this at $6.\n\nWhether you're pumping yourself full of food for a hard night out, hungover, or just hungry, this is the place to be. With the friendly environment, great company, delicious cuisine, and college student-friendly prices, it's a perfect dining experience. My friends and I always visit here whenever we're in Vegas and we have some really great memories here. It's a tradition we plan on continuing for as long as we hang out in LV together."

About a year ago I gave in, and feel like an idiot for not coming earlier.\n\nThis restaurant is located off the floor of Tuscany casino.  Don't let that bother you.  If you want a home style meal, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Marilyn's is perfect.  I have had both breakfast and dinner here.  The menu is extensive, there is something for everyone.  I always get the half-chicken dinner (it comes with big fluffy rolls and 2 sides of your choice (a list of anything from potatoes, veggies, salad, fruit, etc).  Dinner is always super fast and delicious.  The breakfast menu is expansive, as are the portions.  They serve a very high quality of food here.\n\nI have never had a bad meal here.  It is not a fancy strip restaurant, more of a diner ambiance, but that is part of the charm."

The waitress brought her a bottle with about a quarter inch of brown liquid in it and said this is vinegar.  It wasn't.  It was soy sauce, so that went back. . .\n\nWe asked to talk to the manager; we had to ask four people to speak to the manager until he finally begrudgingly came over.

The club gods were not kind to us, so at 3am we went back to the hotel instead of having food.\n\nSteak and eggs were still on our minds the next day, so we came out here before heading back home. It's $13 during normal hours, but you get 8 oz of steak, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast (we opted for English muffin) and hashbrowns.\n\nService was quite slow due to large parties, even though the restaurant was not full. The food was really good - not sure if that's due to my hangover state or the actual food. The steak was cooked nicely, although a bit more on the rare side of my medium rare than usual. It could've used more spices. But then, I'm not judging it like a steakhouse, considering for my one steak at CUT in LA I could've gotten 10 of these.\n\nTip: ask for the butter on the side. There was so much butter on all the toast/english muffin/etc that one of my friends thought she got a grilled cheese instead of toast before biting into it...\n\nOverall, good cheap-ish option. Would have totally given this a 5 star if I had the $6 steak and eggs. Ah well, there's always next time."

I will say the hash browns were good, but that is the only thing that was good. They use a disgusting version of cheddar cheese that tasted like powder and was almost not edible. The pancakes were obviously sitting in the heat lamp too long and the top of the top pancake was hard as a rock (and the plate was extremely hot which is usually a sign of heat lamp exposure).\n\nThe third time we went for dinner. I was between the chicken fried steak, the chicken cordon blue and the ribs. The waiter told me not to get the chicken fried steak (never a good sign when the waiter tells you not to eat something), and another guest told me not to have the chicken cordon blue. So by process of elimination I was stuck with the ribs which were also bad.\n\nThe ribs came with two sides. I chose the mashed potatoes which were okay but the mac and cheese was absolutely horrible. Probably because they use the same cheese as I had on my eggs at breakfast. Guess I should have anticipated that. Another person at my table also had the mac and cheese and also hated it.\n\nThe service was okay for a coffee shop, but overall, this place is crap. I will never go back."

The first morning we just needed a quick bite before we started the day with some friends so we worked our way down to the caf\u00e9 in the hotel l. Luckily I decided to take a look at the menu before we were seated because the prices were way out of line.  A standard 2 egg, toast, bacon and coffee breakfast would have run about $13 each.  I figure that this is Vegas baby and I want a cheap steak and egg breakfast with all the trimmings for under $10. We then stopped by the buffet and found that the Friday morning breakfast buffet cost was over $20 each! What happened to cheap eats at the casinos? Needless to say we walked out and found McDonalds next door and had a quick cheap fast food meal for under $10 for the both of us which was much more to what we really were looking for. The next morning, after a late night out of fun and drinking we wanted a good sit down breakfast but again we didn't want to over pay by double so since I did have a car I figured I would yelp some local breakfast joints.  There were many but for some reason Marilyn's really stood out to us.  It was close, had tons of great reviews and it just sounded like exactly what we were looking for. Marilyn's is located at the Tuscany suites on Flamingo inside the small casino. Parking was a breeze and since the casino was very small we weren't too far from it when we walked in the front door. We got there around 10:30am and found it was perfect timing because we got a booth right away and the place was packed about 30 minutes later and had people waiting for a table by time we left just after 12. The menu was varied and you can choose breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime but we opted for breakfast.  I had the 2 pork chops and eggs any style that was served with has browns and toast which I subbed out for a biscuit. The  pork chops were thick sliced, center cut and cooked to perfection, the hash browns were crispy, the eggs were perfectly cooked to over easy with the whites cooked all the way through and the yolk runny and the biscuit was nice and flakey. My wife had a ham and cheese omelet  that was very tasty and also came with all the standard breakfast trimmings.  I noticed that they do offer a $4.99 steak and egg deal that is served midnight to 5 or 6am and then goes up a couple of bucks after that until I think noon and then goes up a couple of dollars more. We enjoyed our breakfast so much that we took our friends there after midnight on Saturday night and we all had the steak and egg special that is the perfect nightcap to a night of drinking dancing and gambling! I highly recommend Marilyn's for any meal and will go back next time I'm in town."

Service was great and FAST which is excellent when it's 3 in the morning and you kind of just want to creep off to bed before the food coma hits you too hard.\n\nMy steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was MUCH more tender than the steak over at Ellis Island. No sawing necessary. \n\nPark to the rear of the casino building for quick and easy access."

            "review": "While some Vegas hotel-casinos are known for their grandiose buffets, others are more known for their cheap, late-night steak & eggs specials. Marilyn's is an unassuming diner found within the Tuscany casino. Open 24 hours a day, this special only runs midnight to 6:00 am and is off menu. \n\nLooking back at reviews from a few years ago, the price of the steak & eggs special has been steadily increasing by about a dollar a year. It was $3.99 back in 2011-12, $4.99 in 2013, and now currently $5.99. Still, it's a cheap deal for a 6 oz. NY strip (see what they did there?), 2 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast (wheat, rye, or sourdough). Don't expect too much because the steak isn't like Lawry's across the street, but it'll do for late-night eats. \n\nThe best tip I can offer is to order the steak one level rarer than what you usually get. I once received a well-done steak after ordering a medium-rare. My rare order last night came out a decent medium-rare."

John, our first server, was close to ending his shift and rushed us through the ordering process. When we got our food it was barely warm and drinks had to be requested twice. We were not impressed. I didn't know what to say to the family as I remember the cafe as being quite good for the price. We ordered a second round of crab plates when John disappeared without a word. No waiter, no crab, no drink refills. \n\nI was about to approach the manager. And another waiter saw my distress. James saved the day. He has a smile, customer skills, and took responsibility for making the rest of our dining an event and fun. He was there with drinks, hot sides of potato chips, and steaming hot tasty plates of crab. Thanks Marilyn's Cafe. We had a great time. John almost lost the place a few customers. But thanks to James and Sonia for making it pleasant. \n\nOn Fridays, arrive early (before 4pm) or late (10pm for new shift). The staff said the wait can be up to 2 hours otherwise. Ask for James and tip him well, hard worker."

Until LDW '14 my world was about the change.\n\nI've heard many stories of \"The Steak and Eggs of Tuscany Suites\"... And finally got to experience th for myself this Labor Day Weekend! After night at the nightclub, this was the brightest of ideas to pop into our semi-sober minds! To my astonishment the fabled Steak and Eggs were located at Marilyn's Cafe inside of Tuscany Suites! Stayed there on several occasions and in retrospect, am ashamed I did not take advantage of this when staying only minutes walk from where we stayed.\n\nWe were seated immediately and got straight to business! Majority of us went straight for the meal of stories while others went for the Spaghetti and Meatballs which was advertised on the board when walking in. \n\nOnce the meals were out and it was finally right before my eyes, I was in amazement of the quality cut of beef they used. Cooked medium rare, just the way I liked it. This was hands down wayyyy under priced! Quality was way better than any steak you would get at any Denny's or Applebee's for 1/2 the price. Me being a good friend... I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality late night meal! \n\nOh and don't bother trying anything else... That good. The spaghetti and meatballs aren't anything worth mentioning... But until next time! When the 250 miles are no longer between me and my tastebuds. My wallet will miss you in the meantime."

This is clearly a blessing to late night partiers and midnight snackers alike. It was so great to enjoy a hearty sit down breakfast at 4 am after not having time to eat a proper meal all day. It's slightly off the beaten path of the Strip, but not too far to be inconvenient.\n\nThe food itself was average at best, but it was so cheap that it didn't really matter to me. If you care about the quality, then maybe you're better off going elsewhere. My steak had a lot of gristle on it that I had to cut off. The other elements (eggs, hash browns, toast) are hard to mess up so those were fine. I think the quality is comparable to normal diner food. My friend ordered a basket of calamari and it was not good, but then why would you get calamari at a diner? \n\nService was polite and quick given the hour. This is a great spot for late night comfort food, good and simple.\n\nFood: 2.5, Service: 3, Environment: 4, Price: 5"

It also looked like the environment was a lot better than Ellis Island.\n\nOnce I arrive I have to wait 5+ minutes to be sat because the host is off somewhere else. Then I'm sat and NO ONE comes to greet me, ask if I want something to drink or anything for 10 minutes! Finally a server on his way to drop off a guest check at the last remaining occupied table in my section stops and asks if I have been helped. I told him no and he takes my order and brings me back a water using lots of 'here you are beautiful'. He was the only saving grace of my visit but that was short lived because I overheard him telling his last table that his shift was over. \n\nI order the four piece fried chicken and it is brought out in about 12 minutes by a lady. No one comes back to check on me the entire time I'm eating. When I'm done I ask the food runner who I can get my check from and he says he'll let my server know. I find that interesting because 'I' don't even know who my server is. The lady who dropped off my food but never introduced herself or spoke to me drops off the check and asks if I want a box. I say yes. It then takes a little bit to get the box. As I get up to leave to go to the cashier she then yells out \"Thank you so much, have a nice day!\" as if she just remembered she wants a tip for her non-service.\n\nSo then I get to the cashier and it's a whole new barrel of monkeys. I hand the cashier my debit card and she says she needs my id for credit cards. I tell her I didn't bring it in my little wristlet because I didn't want to gamble and just came over for lunch. I say it's debit and I'll put in my pin. She says they don't have the machine and that I would need my ID.  I only left $8.79 in my wristlet and my check is $9.74 and I tell her again I didn't bring my license cause I walked and wasn't planning on gambling and just brought my debit card. I ask for a manager. She goes away, comes back and says the manager is busy but that it's their policy to need ID even for a debit card cause they are going to run it as credit and that I can go use the casino ATM. I tell her there is no way I'm taking out cash at a casino ATM and that there should have been a notice prior to a guest sitting down and eating in the restaurant that I would need id to use my debit card as that is not common practice to need one at restaurants. The large sign by the cash register only says you need id and room key if you are going to make a room charge. Seeing as how I'm at Tuscany eating and staying at The Westin that didn't apply to me. She then walks over to a small notice in small writing on the other side of the other register that says for credit cards you need id. Again I tell her that I brought by DEBIT card, and that little sign won't be seen by anyone, AND it would be seen after the fact. After someone has already eaten. I told her I'm trying to pay but I'm not using using their ATM and I only have $8.74 in cash on me and if the manager is too busy to come speak with a guest (I even showed her the copy of my work id that I have a pic of on my iphone that shows I'm airline crew which has helped many times at hotel front desks when I've locked my room key in my room and I need them to reissue me another one) then thatbis not my problem. Finally, she goes back to wherever she went before, comes back and takes the cash I do have and says next time bring ID, and I tell her there won't be a next time.\n\nBetween the horrible service, then the cashier incident, I would not go back to that place. The food was fine, but nothing special. Not to mention the pieces of chicken were 25-50% smaller than any normal sized chicken pieces you would get at KFC or the grocery store."

It was pretty late in the Evening last week, and we heard about the popularity of the $3.99 Steak & Eggs - there really aren't any more CHEAP Breakfasts around Las Vegas any more - this is one of the remnants from the good ol' days. The inexpensive Steak & Eggs, from what I understand, are especially popular with Students.\n\nMarilyn's is named after one of the original owners of the Tuscany Casino... even though presently, the Tuscany is corporately owned. Decor is laid-back 50s, especially with the dim incandescent tube lamps over each table or booth. Reminded me of a Spanish Hacienda or an Italian Villa themed restaurant with the dark woods and dim lights.... in keeping, I guess, with the Tuscany theme of the Casino.\n\nOn the menu...\n\nPrime Rib (**** $10.95) Meat! That's what I like! The only qualification of a good cut of Prime Rib, IMO, is... leave some Fat in my cut of Prime Rib! And that's what the Chefs at Marilyn's accomplish. Quite a bit more than the 10 ounces stated on the menu... that's alright by me! Side of Cauliflower (** 1/2) - way, way over-cooked, though. And a side of Baked Potato (*** 1/2)... pretty hard not to mess this up. Prefaced with some Dinner Rolls with Butter - OK. Also came with a tin of Au Jus - kids were asking why I wasn't dipping - I never mess up a piece of good meat with anything else!\n\nAt less than $1.00 per ounce of Beef - a very, very good value, especially with some Fat left on the Prime Rib. Lucky for me tonight, Marilyn's didn't try to get \"Healthy\" on me... Ate the Whole Thing! Nothing left on the plate!\n\nFried Bananas (****) The low rating for this Dessert was primarily my fault... took a little longer to finish the Prime Rib than I thought it would. Therefore the Fried Bananas just sat for a few minutes longer than it should have. I'm a meat guy... wanted to finish off that Beef before starting on the Sweet Stuff! Don't \"mess\" with the Fried Bananas with a side of Ice Cream... liked it the way if was... just Fried. Really, really good finish to the meal. \n\nIced Tea\n\nValue (**** 1/2) As with most restaurants in Casinos, the value factor in a restaurant is usually pretty high because the losses you incur at gambling usually will cover the expenses that most Casino restaurants incur. \n\nNot crowded on a late weekday evening, just three tables occupied when we dined here... BUT, as with any restaurant associated with a Casino or Hotel in Las Vegas... there WILL be lines and lines of people on the Weekends! This is a basic Casino Coffee Shop, if you don't equate Marilyn's to Fine Dining you'll be OK."

It's a good deal for the crab, but in my opinion there are so many options in Vegas that surpass Marilyn's Cafe.\n\nPros:  \n  *  There's an AYCE crab feast for $15.98 per person on Friday nights\n  *  the AYCE option comes with 2 side dishes \n  *  Free refills on drinks \n  *  Service was pretty good.  The manager of the restaurant even came by.\n  *  Quality of the crab itself was mediocre\n\nCons:\n  *  Outdated ambiance\n  *  No refills on your sides\n  *  Slow service\n  *  Raised the price on the AYCE option (previously $12.99)\n  *  It was cold throughout the restaurant.\n\nOverall:\n  Since the last time I went here, it seems that they have boosted up the price a bit on the AYCE.  That was the main thing that Marilyn's Cafe had going for them was the crab at a killer price.  Since it's a bit more expensive now (in comparison to before), there are other places throughout the valley that offer AYCE for a little more money (way better quality though and more for your money too).  It also doesn't help that was extremely chilly inside the restaurant.  It made my meal less enjoyable.  I live in the Northwest side of town and it's always a pain to get to Tuscany Suites from home (especially on a Friday night).  I do not think I'll be coming here for their AYCE crab anytime soon.  Perhaps on another night for their regular menu, but I have yet to try that.  I'll definitely update my review once I do though.  From reading other reviews, it seems like they have some other good deals that are worth checking out (such as the Steak and Egss for $3.99... unless they changed the price on that too?)\n\nTips:\n  *  Make sure to check out the menu for all the other days.  Different days = different specials\n  *  Bring something warm to wear.  It was very cold in there.\n  *  You have to walk out of the restaurant to use the restroom, but its right around the corner."

She actually seemed to be happy to do her job, not like some of the soulless eyes that stare back at you in Vegas.  \n\nJeff got the eggs benedict.  He had ordered them the day before and decided to do them again.  They looked great and the eggs were perfectly cooked.  He got some orange juice.  It was ok, but it had a flavor that we couldn't quite place.  I think there may have been something else in the juice mix, maybe tangerine.  \n\nI got the chili omelet with grits.  The grits were delicious, not too dry and not undercooked.  They added a dollop of butter, which is the way that everyone should eat grits.  (Now, if they had some cheese, I might have added a little of that, too.  I guess I could have asked, but a chili omelet is already enough gut-busting damage as it is.)  The chili was kinda funky and didn't have much flavor.  The omelet was well done, however.  It wasn't too dry nor too runny.  I wasn't going to order toast, but then I changed my mind.  Nedra had toast out to me in less than a minute and it was hot and buttered.  Damn, that is good service.\n\nJeff got excited and accidentally knocked over his juice, all over the toast.  Within 3 milliseconds, there was a waiter/busboy with a stack of napkins to wipe up the spill.  He was gone and back in a flash with more napkins.  Nedra came over, tsk'd us, offered more juice and brought out more toast.  So impressive. Most places would just ignore you.  \nThe style of the restaurant reminded me of broken-down Santa Fe style, though I'm sure they were trying to imitate some rustic Italian villa.  (It doesn't work.)\n\nNormally, I would give this place a 3 star, but Nedra made it 4."

The server was a little slow to take my order, which was surprising since there were only two people in his section at the time. I ordered the chicken parmesan, which came with garlic toast and spaghetti; no other sides. The wait for the food seemed a little long; again surprising since the crowd wasn't very big. \n\nThe meal was a huge disappointment. I never thought there could be too much cheese on Chicken Parmesan but boy was I wrong. It was completely smothered in goopy greasy mozz. The chicken was obviously a frozen reheat. The pasta was overcooked and soggy (honestly I'm usually okay with overcooked pasta, but not soggy). The sauce was the worst; it definitely tasted canned, almost Chef Boyardee-ish. Yuck!! The only positive was the dinner rolls that were brought to me half way through the meal. The service throughout the meal remained mediocre.\n\nI was tempted to give them a one star... but to be honest, most of the people around me were ordering the prime rib (which was on special) or breakfast items. The prime rib with the salad and baked potato looked delicious and everyone seemed to be enjoying their breakfasts. And as you can see there is a multitude of positive reviews here at Yelp.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and TWO STARS.\n\nUpdate: Not sure why, but I went back for breakfast a few days later.  The breakfast wasn't bad.

No apology, no visit from the manager. Nothing. I said no thank you and tried to eat the rest of my food. My fianc\u00e9 had ordered a bagel, which after asking two times never showed up. After pointing this out to our server she appeared to realize her tip was in jeopardy and wrote us off. With an eye-roll she walked away and did not come back to refill drinks or ask how our food was. My food was cold and a bit salty. Another friend of ours got the fires with gravy. He stated they were just \"ok\". \n\nI am really not getting all the positive reviews for this place. Service was awful, managers were MIA, no attempt to remedy the problems or care that we were happy in the slightest. Avoid at all costs. There are way too many choices in Vegas to settle for this mediocrity."

We had the eggs and steak and hashbrowns for five dollars which is a fantastic deal. We did have a trouble ordering a beer for some reason it confused the staff. We waited quite a while for the food but we had no complaints given it was so late and we were so hungry. The value and the atmosphere were good. One thing I would not recommend if you are sensitive to smoke - there was a lot of cigarette smokers inside the casino. \n\nFood quality was really only 3.5 stars."

One word comes to mind: impressive. \n\nA very warm and inviting atmosphere with a good view of the casino. It's a casual dinner witch is always a plus and also does room service for the hotel. \n\nAvoid a-la-carte items as these appeared a little heavy to me for a dinner. However the special menus(daily and lunch were VERY attractive.\n\nThe prime rib was sensational. Something I'd expect out of a higher end steak house. I asked for it rare and got it that way which was very pleasing. The horseradish was a nice balance of spivey and flavor. The greens and mashed potatoes were fresh and cooked just right. \n\nThe service was just as good as the food and I'll probably be back a few more times this week!"

Took 10 minutes for someone to come up to us and greet us, by then we were already set on the steak and egg deal that I thought was $4.99. \n\nSteak and eggs was nothing  extraordinary, Norms is much better than what I was served. They over buttered my English muffins to the point where I scraped a few good chunks off. The steak was asked for medium rare and was over cooked to well. It was decent but nothing to get excited over. Had to use hot sauce and salt for more flavor. I ordered my eggs over medium since I love it runny and that was surprisingly cooked perfectly. I like combining it with the steak or hash brown, it helps give different texture. Eventually we finished our meal but service was no where to be found for a refill of water. I just grabbed my sister's water and finished it. Eventually we flagged our waiter to get the check and paid our way."

Portions are not huge, though satisfying-- option for a double order steak and eggs available for about $10. The late night steak and eggs special is not on the menu, but very much so available. Their thick, creamy clam chowder is also tasty and very filling! Despite being open 24 hours and numerous drunken encounters throughout the night, all of the employees here are wonderful! In addition to this, if you are sober enough to drive yourself here (don't drink and drive!), Marilyn's parking is easy peasy-- located right outside the Casino. No complicated parking structure to venture through. Marilyn's is perfect for late night, cheap eats."

It's located in the Tuscany hotel and casino.\n\nPARKING: Free, huge parking lot.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Has that denny's/ihop feel to it but we got a big booth for 8 of us and were seated right away.\n\nFOOD: Coming at 2:30am they had the steak and eggs special.  I didn't see it on the menu but just ask for it and the waiter will get it for you.  I think it was $4.99 or $5.99 but either way very cheap.  Ask for it more rare than you normally order it because it is pretty thin and they tend to overcook the meat.  I got medium rare and it was only pink.  \n\nThe platter comes with steak, 2 eggs, hash browns and 4 pieces of toast (you can choose).  I got the eggs over easy and they were runny but not gross.  I got sourdough toast, where they put the butter on it for you and it was SO GOOD.  The hash browns were tasty, not bland and hard but still hot and crispy.\n\nThe steak was OK, as you can imagine for such a cheap price, but the flavoring wasn't bad.  It was just slightly tough.\n\nOverall, definitely a must for your trip to Vegas."

I also don't like eating late at night but he told me I'd regret it if I didn't.\n\nI was starving by the time he got back since I stayed up waiting for him to return. My take-out box had steak, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast. The steak, to be honest, was barely edible and had a ton of fat. Another friend, who was also starving, thought it was delicious and ate most of it. The eggs were scrambled, pretty bland, and could've used some salt. So... why 4 stars?\n\nThe Loaded Hashbrowns -- it's $1 more to get them loaded, but do it anyway (uh, it's only a $1). I can promise you you won't regret it, because it's the most delightfully delicious concoction of hashbrowns, gravy, cheese, and only God knows what else (crack?); especially when you're starving at 4 AM.

Have been there before, and the food was good, but the servers were so busy they couldn't spend much time. Sort of threw food at you. This time though, John, our server, was outstanding. He was right there when we sat down, asked for our drink order and didn't wait for the busser to bring them. Asked if we were still having crab legs, as we go there EVERY FRIDAY for them. We said yes, and he brought the bucket, my extra lemon and extra napkins before we even ordered it. Dinner was served promptly and he kept the crab legs coming, even asking if I wanted more just before I was finished with first order so second order would be there right as I was done. (So we wouldn't have to wait, since they were so busy). John is one of the best servers in the bunch. We have been there numerous times at different days and times since we are locals, and John ALWAYS knows what we are drinking and usually has some idea of what we are going to want to eat. He makes sure our drinks are always full, and if the bussers are busy he even clears the table so we don't have a bunch of plates piling up. If you want excellent food and extraordinary and attentive service, GO TO MARILYN'S CAFE AND ASK FOR JOHN.(he only works nights)"

So when my husband takes me to an all you can eat crab legs im in heaven.  \nThe restaurant was very clean and it was nice, Tuscany Casino is a small casino compared to what you expect to see near the strip. I wasn't sure on what to expect, but i was very pleased. If you order all you can eat crab legs and you want bread, you need to ask. They will only bring you bread when you ask. \nThe crab legs where delicios and warm/hot, which i love. You get to pick 2 sides. I got green beans and mash potatoes, both were great. \n\nI'm giving them 4 stars because it took them a little while to bring more crab legs and also for soda refills. The waiter was really nice, I could tell that she got very busy and she was going back between tables. It's fine with me, i worked at a restaurant before and i understant how that can be. Over all great experience and the price is only $19.99 per person. *plus drinks"

The avocado verde sauce was DECENT but, in all honesty, I can do a better job in my own kitchen. My boyfriends waffle wasn't any better. I think he would've been happier with a stack of Eggos. And my best friend described her pancakes as \"no better than iHop.\" Not to mention, her hash browns were drenched in oil. Our meal was not worth the price. I would have rather bought groceries and cooked breakfast on my own in my hotel room. \n\nThe ONE upside, (which is why I had to give two stars instead of one), is that they will bring you complimentary bread upon request.

The service was just right. Only coming back when plates were clearly done or to refill beverages which clearly needed to be filled; and they were friendly about it.\n\nThe food was pretty darn good. The $3.95 all day all you can eat pancakes are beyond adequate for that price. The steak and eggs special, while not on the level to make Gordon Ramsay not scream, were very good for the price and you got to pancakes as a side. The steak was a bit thin and had some more fat on it thenI would have liked, but nothing to cry about. The eggs weren't perfect, but having been to Vegas 8 times in 6 years and having 40+ breakfasts, I am yet to find good eggs. So I was not unhappy. I didn't get sick and they looked/tasted like eggs. Little ketchup and Tabassco did wonders (as they usually do).\n\nMy group also, took part in the all-you-can eat crab legs on Friday night for $16.95. We took down 100+ legs. None of us were sick or even felt uncomfortable...just full. Again, not the best I have ever had, but really, quality shell fish in Vegas is hard to come-by (I live in CT, good seafood is a staple in my neck of the woods, so I am spoiled...very few places in Vegas come even close to what I experience on the norm).\n\nI will agree with one Yelper down below...BRING YOUR OWN WATER. The water was a bit funky. It may be the local filtration process, I do not know. But after a 'long night in Vegas', water the next morning is clutch. Not from here though.\n\nI would give this 4.5 stars if possible. But I went with 4, because of the Water thing, and the steaks were a 'tad underwhelming' (that may be too harsh, but it is the best I can think of).

The decor is very pleasant reminiscent of an outdoor cafe along the coast of Greece. \n\nThe food is great. It was so good we ate here two days. On our first day we came for breakfast. My hubby had breakfast and I opted for a patty melt. The patty melt was de-lish-ous! It was well seasoned and just enough of a portion where I didn't feel like I was overeating. \n\nOn our second day we came for lunch. I had the shrimp skewer (which came with 12 very large shrimp). The prices are very reasonable also. You will not be disappointed visiting the place. 2 thumbs up"

We were here around 9 am and it was busy but no wait to be seated. Our waitress, Rebecca, was very friendly and kept our coffee cups full! I'd definitely come back again for breakfast! Compared to other 24 hour Vegas cafes this is one of the best - clean, comfortable and a great value."

Still the service was great as always. I would suggest bringing your own cracking instrument as they have this little plastic one that doesn't really work.  My husband was jealous of this young lady at another table, who was eating her crab while she was talking and bringing out huge pieces of crab everytime.  I took a picture of him because he was so hilarious.  Needless to say this was his first time eating crab legs and he didn't get stuffed or even full. Next time we'll bring pliers and do it right so he can get stuffed."

It's not some prime cut ish you would find in a bitchin steak house.  But for the price you pay, you definitely get something well worth it.
