            "review": "AMAZING. \n\nThis is the best restaurant I have EVER eaten in my whole life. \n\nThis restaurant is located in Downtown Vegas in the Golden Nugget hotel. Compared to other restaurants I have seen in Vegas this one is a bit smaller, which isn't a bad thing because it provided a more intimate/romantic feeling to it. The staff was amazing and on top of everything. The only thing I did not like about this restaurant was the bathroom. It was located outside the restaurant in the casino. Seemed a little out of the way to me. \n\nThe Food. \nAppetizer 1: Oyster Rockefeller http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vic-and-anthonys-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?filter_by_userid=True&select=gPS8SUN9C0iTjZdP_qVKOQ&userid=to5QXyxyI84QCR9JJMXrSw#R8SdoBWP1QGfsTU_oMhfiw\nThis was my first time trying oyster Rockefeller. It tasted amazing! This was a great way to start our dinner. It also came with half a dozen. \n\nAppetizer 2: Steak Tartare  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vic-and-anthonys-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?filter_by_userid=True&select=gPS8SUN9C0iTjZdP_qVKOQ&userid=to5QXyxyI84QCR9JJMXrSw#XidOHOant3N9loHPOzgivA\nThis app is served on a salt block (which was amazing because I have never had anything served on a salt block before, only seen it on iron chief) comes with chips, cornichons and whole grained mustard. TASTED AMAZING. I think everyone should try this.\n\nEntr\u00e9e 1: 8 oz. Filet Mignon \nI ordered this for dinner and added the Jumbo Lump Crab Oscar topping. Wow. It tasted great. \n\nEntr\u00e9e 2: 16 oz. New York Sirloin \nMy boyfriend ordered this for his entr\u00e9e and he said it was amazing. \n\nSide: Mashed potato \nGOOD!\n\nOverall, this restaurant was fantastic and everything tasted amazing. I will 100% recommend this place to all of my friends that go to Vegas :)"

            "review": "Okay, if you're a guest of the casino, Vic & Anthony's has one particular meal that you simply can't pass up.  It's an Australian lobster tail they fly in and it is gooooood.  The reason I mention guest of the casino is because while I love an awesome lobster, this particular one is outside the range of what I'd pay for a single meal; it's I think around $120 to $130, and that's before you order drinks, apps, sides, etc. If Golden Nugget is picking up your bills though, oh mama, you better order this monster.  It's very close to a pound, post-cooked weight, so you could probably even split it if you wanted.  It's an unusual taste, kind of sweet, so completely different than what you'd get from a Maine lobster tail.  I had it twice on my last visit, saved half and turned it into breakfast the next day; simply fantastic.\n\nAs far as everything else goes; I've always been very pleased with the food and drinks here.  The place is very dimly lit but still has enough light to see some of the old Vegas memorabilia on the walls; lots of photos from days gone by.  The service has been excellent every time I've visited.  They, along with Golden Nugget, are also very accommodating to guests of the casino, so if you're a last minute kind of person, and they are full, ask your casino host to get you in and it will happen; love the service from them and Golden Nugget.\n\nTheir caprese salad is excellent; large fresh crisp tomatoes and big blocks of mozzarella with just the right amount of balsamic vinegar and basil.  Steaks; fresh and always cooked perfectly.  Their servers, and more importantly their cooks, understand how to cook a steak Pittsburgh style so don't hesitate to order it that way if that's how you like it.  Even the sides are excellent; cream corn, onion rings, etc.\n\nThere are a million steak houses in Vegas, and this is probably my number three option; good enough to go out of your way for.  Just as a point of reference, my #1 is N9NE at the Palms; their surf & turf is simply the best meal I've ever had, so it will be very hard for anywhere else to ever displace them."

            "review": "The filet mignon was among the five best steaks of my life. My wife had the best seabass she's ever eaten.  The atmosphere is romantic but not stuffy or overly formal.  The service is good (thanks Dennis) the drinks are reasonably priced ($6 beer) and the entrees fetch standard steakhouse prices of around $40 for a steak. \n\nThe sides are nice but the creamed spinach could more accurately be described as cheese with a bit of spinach. The pear salad was amazing and the potatoes Lyonnaise were great too. \n\nI'm a steak lover and the filet was really outatanding. It had a nice flavor as if it had been seasoned or marinated, but the taste complemented rather than overpowered the meat. The filet wasn't so heavy that I felt like I was biting into a cow.   I would dine here again in a heartbeat."

The chilled seafood appetizer had the most amazing oysters and my filet was perfect as was my fianc\u00e9e's ribeye. The au gratin potatoes were as decadent as grandmas. Jim brought us bread pudding dessert made from cinnamon croissants that topped an absolutely perfect meal. Lovely ambience, Sinatra in the background. Love love love this place."

            "review": "On everything that doesn't involve the food this place gets a 5. Nice decor and a very professional wait staff. Great wine list as well. It's very pricey but not outrageously so considering where you are and what you expect to get.\n\nNow onto the food. Which is what really matters when separating a steak house from a really great steakhouse.\n\nWe started out with the calamari with peppers. It was good, interesting flavor with a touch of heat. We also had the chips and strings which are exactly that. Homemade potato chips and onion string served with ketchup. Nothing special that would make me get it again.\n\nThe specials include a 27oz dry aged \"Cowboy\" ribeye steak for $149. Considering that the 16 oz ribeye was $48 we didn't bite. Dry aged steak is great but not at those prices and the big bone , the cowboy part, is nothing more than a gimmick adds nothing to the food.\n\nThe sides we ordered included the brussel sprouts, wild mushrooms, baked potato and mashed potatoes.  All tasty and overpriced but while in a \"premium\" steakhouse not unusual.\n\nNow for the steak. I ordered the prime ribeye. Cooked exactly as I ordered it, so kudos to the cook. Unfortunately I've had a better piece of meat from Costco. It was not seasoned very well, if at all. The meat itself was tender but not what you would expect from a prime steak.  \n\nMy wife had the lobster mac and cheese which she liked. The lobster tail is lightly breaded and fried. The cheese sauce was light and tasty. A good entree.\n\nOverall not bad but there is certainly better places to spend your money for a premium steak."

We had drunks before we got here which I should've slowed down on but once we got out food, I was just blown away. And to make things worse I was so toasted I forgot to take pics. Damnit. Haha. Next it's dinner before the drinks. My dinner date had so much wine she's passed out next to me. This place was money well spent and we'll definitely be back sooner than later. Our waiter Jim? was excellent. Best lamb cutlets I've had since Australia. Next time no scotch since it doesn't mix well with lobster bisque. Anyhow, if you want great food downtown on the old strip off Fremont, this is a small place but you'll enjoy it. 5 full steins from me.."

We had a delicious foie gras appetizer that wasn't on the menu followed by Maine lobster and a lovely rib eye. All of it was superb and I am very fussy about such things. The service was knowledgeable and professional. \n\nI have to drop a star because they charge $10 for a baked potato. I expected this place to be expensive and it certainly was but I think that's ridiculous. They also allowed a large group of tourists to come in and stand by my table which was like being in a fish tank. That was undesirable."

I like to play at the nugget so its pretty convenient. The mood is dark and old schoolish except for the flat screens over the bar..kinda odd..but i don't really mind it just don't ever remember seeing it before. The lobster tails are from fukushima nuclear plant....I have never seen them so big....serious 3 eye action there. All and all pretty solid..but not the best."

Nothing on the strip or off the strip can compare to this place. You MUST check it out. As you walk in from the time you leave, First Class all the way. The hostess is very professional, the bartenders are all top notch, my server was outstanding and the ambiance was perfect for Las Vegas. We enjoyed Salmon and Crab legs with a bottle of the bubbly. A perfect and romantic evening for my wife and I to enjoy a delicious dinner while listing to the rat pack and actually see photos of the Golden Nugget back in the day is truly remarkable.

            "review": "Vic & Anthony's is located inside the Golden Nugget right next to the lobby/check-in counters.  Compared to the other restaurants in this hotel it is very discreet and kind of hard to find on the bustling casino level, but there are several signs directing you which way to go and plenty of employees who could do the same.\n\nThe first time I went was on a Saturday at about 7pm, and it was very busy. I was by myself and looking for a restaurant with a nice bar area where I could have a drink and a nice dinner alone, without feeling too on display.  Though at full capacity in the dining area, the hostess took me immediately to the bar area where there were a few empty spots and I was seated promptly, a pleasant surprise.  The bar area is fantastic, classy, comfortable, and removed from the dining area enough to feel a more comfortable/casual atmosphere, yet close enough to feel an elegant and intimate vibe.\n\nThough the bar was busy on both occasions, I was immediately acknowledged and given a dinner menu and wine list.  After debating over what drink to order, I was greeted by the sommelier, Brian, who was very educated and passionate about the wines offered.  It was an added treat to talk to someone familiar with the Washington wineries I have so often visited. Despite his extensive knowledge and expertise on the subject, he explained the selections very clearly and in a way that did not overwhelm me and or seem pretentious, as sommeliers so often tend to be.  It was very refreshing and his suggestions were excellent.  The wine was definitely a highlight of my vacation.\n\nThe lead bartender both nights, Noah, was hands down the best I have ever come across. It was very fun to watch him make drinks all night. Friendly, efficient, and masterfully trained.  His cocktails were like works of art and so exciting to watch him create.  He also gave me suggestions on the dinner menu, all of which were perfection.  The first night I ordered the raw oysters as an appetizer, and they were wonderful.  There were 6 oysters served on the half shell on a bed of ice with fresh horseradish, tabasco, lemon, cocktail sauce, and mignonette as accompianments.  I am a big oyster fan, and these hit the spot.  This was followed by the wedge salad which was so good I ordered it again the following night. A heaping plate of creamy, tart roquefort cheese and crisp iceberg lettuce, it was the best I had ever had. And at $9 it was a steal! The following night Noah suggested the crabcake as an appetizer, which I was hesitant about because I have had so many bad ones, but trusted his judgement and went with it.  This was absolutely delicious. For dessert you must order the bread pudding.  I was told it was award winning, and was not disappointed.  I had this both nights as well, justifying this indulgence by telling myself I was on vacation and could eat whatever I wanted... No regrets.\n\nIf you are anywhere near the Las Vegas area, you must come here.  Could not recommend this place enough!"

            "review": "And you thought Downtown Las Vegas was a place for cheap drinks, thrills, gambling and titty bars.\n\nThis place rivals most of the fine dining places on the strip and the pricing is actually very reasonable for the caliber of food. The portions are very large and the service is very fast and friendly. The atmosphere is dark and very intimate though there are spots in the middle perfect for casual dining, if you take your significant other then make sure you get a table along the walls of the place for an even nicer experience.\n\nI would recommend a good cut of steak, the veal or the big 25 oz rib eye is the way to go. Pair it with a Pinot Noir and the lobster bisque soup. If you are not a meat fan ( you really shouldnt go to this place then ) but seriously if you just are not feeling steak then i would definitely get the jumbo shrimp and crab cakes.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place, it is also a great last minute nice place to eat just in case you forgot to make plans or need a place to impress with little or no time advance or reservations."

It's been a while for me, however, Ruben took his mother for her birthday last year since we enjoyed it so much and they had a great time! \n\nWe started our meal with the Calamari with Sweet and Spicy Peppers ($13), Beefsteak Tomato & Onion Salad with Roquefort Cheese ($11), and Lobster Bisque, finished with Cognac ($11). I enjoyed the sweet and spicy sauce on the calamari and the bisque was delicious. The salad was good, but disappointingly scarce with three slices of tomato and four very thin slices of red onion.\n\nRuben and I both enjoyed an 8-ounce Filet Mignon ($39) with Wild Mushrooms ($11), Steamed Asparagus ($10), Macaroni & Cheese ($9), and Sea Salt Fries ($8) as our accompaniments. Their steaks are USDA Prime Midwest Grain-Fed and were perfectly prepared (medium rare) and really delicious. We were very pleased with all the side dishes as well.\n\nService was spectacular and we enjoyed a complimentary chocolate cake at the end of our dinner. Vic & Anthony's has been a highly recommended steakhouse choice for both of us and we will always love to return!"

            "review": "I recently found myself in Vegas on business and decided to head down town on my last night on a recommendation to try Vic & Antimony's. I had read a few reviews and was excited to enjoy some of their signature items.\n\nWhen I arrived I was impressed with the decor, which I like to describe as 1977 meets 2007.  It's got dark woods and some cream colors with heavy curtains, that adorn large windows and decorated walls. Very tasteful.  I immediately noticed the glass display case featuring rib-eye, new york, and porterhouse cuts as well as LARGE (and i mean HUGE) Australian cold water tails that were 18-20oz EACH. They also house two lobster tanks with 3-4 pound lobsters which they offer at $29 per pound (which I think is a little high).\n\nWe were sat at a nice table in the center of the restaurant and ordered several items.  I did not opt for the lobster tails, as they are $145 each (not a bad price, but a little outside my range for the evening). Next time though I will bring my brother and split a 12oz filet and 20oz lobster.\n\nTo start, we got the Calamari, which is tossed in a onion-pepper sauce. The portion was large and included LOTS of really nice caramelized onions, however in my opinion the sauce was too thick and the rings should have been tossed in it instead of just placed on top. Also the breading on the rings was more crumb based and heavy. Would have been better with panko. Rings and tentacles were nicely cooked however, not stringy or rubbery.  $12.95 7/10\n\nNext we received the Pear and Saga Blue Cheese Salad, mixed field greens with teardrop tomatoes, candied pecans and house-made creamy vinaigrette.  A really excellent salad.  The pears were nice and ripe, the pecans crunchy and fresh. There was quite a bit of avocado as well, just enough dressing which was sweet, tangy and slightly thickened. A nice compliment to the pear and cheese.  I would go back for this one again. 11.50. 10/10\n\nOur third course was their famous lobster bisque. It's not an overly large portion, but what was lacking in quantity was more than made up for in quality.  I've had few better bisques.  Rich and creamy (but not overly so) this dish did NOT suffer from having too much sherry cream, but at the same time the sherry flavor was front and center but not overbearing. It's also finished with cognac, and that is easily tasted too.  Decent amount of lobster meat, intense (in a good way) lobster flavor. I could eat it non-stop! 10/10 A STEAL at $9.95.\n\nMain Course was the Sea Bas ala Nage.  They use Chilean Sea Bass as the protein, sauteed in a Dunginess crab butter sauce, balsamic, harcourt verts, roasted tomatoes and topped with a few lumps of dungeness crab.  I've eaten a lot of chilean sea bass in my day, it's probably my favorite protein. This ranks in the top 2 for sure.  Wonderfully cooked, perfect crust on the fish, perfectly accompanied by the butter sauce, nicely cut by the sharpness of the balsamic. Verts were al dente, and nicely cooked. The mound of roasted tomatoes also helped cut the natural oiliness of the bass.  Melt in your mouth. A true triumph. $36.95 10/10\n\nI also tried some of the 8oz filet, and it was beautifully done and seasoned. Rock salt in the preparation makes all the difference! I definitely would not hesitate to order cut beef at this restaurant if I was in the mood. They offer a number of sauces including a bone marrow borderlaise, which wasn't ordered, but I would love to try it in the future.  9/10\n\nFor desert we ordered their famous bread pudding, which is served like a layer cake slice in a pool of whiskey sauce alongside praline ice cream, and a brittle sculpture (edible).  Amazing.  Totally moist, amazing flavors. Everything you want out of a bread pudding without the sloppy look. Ice cream was divine.  I ate pretty much the entire brittle decoration which was killer good as well. 10/10 We also got a flour-less chocolate cake topped with unsweetened whipped cream and surrounded by chocolate sauce. VERY DENSE, very good.  Somehow not overbearing and dry-tasting like ones I have had at Ruth's Chris. Difficult to eat all of on your own. Split the chocolate if you get it. 9/10.\n\nI also got earl grey tea, which I wouldn't normally mention, but it came in a very interesting tea pot of stainless and blown glass. Hard to explain but I thought it was neat.  If you're a tea drinker try it.  The tea itself was excellent as well.\n\nAll in all, this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I will be returning as soon as I can for that massive Lobster!"

            "review": "It makes me a little sad to say it, but this place has declined a bit.  This past weekend we had our latest visit.  We've been there 3 or 4 times previously over the last 4-5 years.  The last time I was there in 2013, I had the best steak I've ever eaten (half of the porterhouse for 2), and this was in line with the quality of my previous visits as well.  This time, they missed that mark by a pretty wide margin.  Mind you, the steak was still excellent, but no longer outstanding, and below the quality of many other expensive, top-line steak houses.  They no longer offer the porterhouse for 2 - although they still have a porterhouse on the menu, and it is still plenty for 2 people (it is now 32 ounces, it used to be over 40, like I said, still plenty for 2 people, but you now have to split the order).  Anyway, the steak was expertly prepared as usual, but the t-bone half was tough.  I had encountered half a dozen pieces of unchewable gristle in the T-bone half.  The filet half was fine and tender, although both halves were not as flavorful as I remember.  It certainly didn't see 'prime' grade.  More like 'choice' grade.  Mind you, this steak comes in at nearly $90, so I think its justified that expectations for it be very high.  It made me wonder if with all the premium steak-houses opening across the country, it is just harder to these high-end places to get the same quality of meat as before.  On the other hand, a dining companion shared a bite of his NY Strip with me (half the price of the porterhouse -note, also 1/3 the weight), and it was absolutely perfect and delicious.  \n\nOther things that have declined.  Our favorite appetizer, \"chips and strings\" (home-made potato chips mixed with fried onion strings) was half the size as before.  Mind you, it also was still plenty - but it was no longer (as a waiter described the previous version) \"Las Vegas over-indulgence in excess\".  Now its just plain over-indulgence.  But worse was that it didn't taste good.  it had a distinct 'old cooking oil' taste to it this time, which was unpleasant.  \n\nEverything else was as before. The restaurant is elegant, the wait staff exemplary, the wine list contains many reasonable price range choices (as well as some highly unreasonable ones too, if that's you thing ;-).  But it will be hard to come back and pay the ultra-premium prices for a steak that is now a step closer to ordinary.\n\nWhile I'm complaining, I'd like to add just one more thing.  While the PA music selection is nice and appropriate (Sinatra and similar), it has always been played too loud (this time and on all my previous visits).  It makes conversation at the table difficult, as you have to raise your voice to be heard over the music.  I wish they'd turn it down by half."

            "review": "food was great here!  Great art deco design. The service was interesting to say the least.  We walked into  the restaurant where we stood for 10 minutes without the hostess acknowleding we were standing there or even looked up. Our server came by several times to check to see how the food was or if we needed anything.  At one point he came by to make small talk that was painfully forced.  The busser was subpar...he came by several times to fill up water and spilled it all over my phone and didn't even notice even when I said something.\n\nWe ordered the foie gras apppetizer, lobster bisque soup, bone in prime ribeye, onion shoestrings, mac n cheese, and creamed spinach.\n\nThe appetizer and soup were okay, but the ribeye and sides are top notch.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly rare as requested. It was super tender and seasoned perfectly.  The onion shoestrings came out as a heaping pile of crispy salty perfection on a plate...enough for 4 people. The mac n cheese was creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. the creamed spinach was loaded with cream and cheese and had a crumbly topping. All the sides were large enough for at least 2 people.\n\nMy only wish was that I had room for dessert...will definately save room next time for the creme brulee or the bread pudding!"

We even got to meet the Chef to tell him how great the meal was.  Wedge salad was beautiful and delicious, but the star of the show was the lobster tail.  It was more than enough for two of us to share and was cooked absolutely perfectly.  I don't remember having better lobster anywhere.  We also loved the au gratin potatoes-rich, cheesy, and delicious.\n\nThe old school vibe brought me back to what I imagine it was like in the old days of Vegas.  Very relaxing.  Vic and Anthony's knocked it out of the park!  Fantastic experience from beginning to end.  We will definitely return on our next trip."

            "review": "My high expectations were met with disappointment. The food was just okay for me. The meal was rather forgettable, nothing really stood out enough for me me to say \"I'd order this again!\"\n\nThe dinner service got off on a very rough start when they refused to seat our party of 11. They refused to seat us because 1 out of 11 of us was running late. ONE person out of 11......does that even make any f'kng sense?\n\nThe 2 doctors in our party tried repeatedly to request to the servers and even the manager, but they refused and kept us waiting at the small narrow bar area for almost 45 mins. Some of us got tipsy while waiting for our tables, while most of us just got agitated for having to wait so long. \n\nIt would've been 35 min wait, but the manager seemed to be OCD or unsatisfied w/the table set-up so he made the staff move and rearrange our tables further down from the its original location. Tacking on additional wait time for us at the cramped bar. \n\nAs I said earlier, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular, nothing memorable.\n\nCHICKEN PAIGE ($26.95): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\nScallopined/thinly cut chicken breasts lightly breaded and pan-fried in a lemon butter sauce. The menu also listed capers and sundried tomatoes cooked into the sauce, but I found cooked down regular tomatoes. No biggie. The portion size was generous and it was tasty. \n\nFRESH FISH A LA NAGE (halibut was the fish special that night, $36.95) \nThe halibut filet was stuffed w/jumbo lump crab meat and served w/baby vegetables. \nI didn't get a chance to take a pic of it, but I was able to steal a couple fork-fulls. \n\nThe under-seasoned halibut was unevenly cooked, some parts were dry and overcooked. \nI'm not so sure if the \"a la nage\" or poaching part was entirely true. \nPerhaps the poaching liquid or \"nage\" was just used to dress the fish after it's been cooked. \n\nJUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES (1 crab cake for $19.95): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=vMTQgbpbzaTeSUFUAhOp5A\n\nYes, you read that right. It's $19 for ONE crab cake. \nThe crab cake was topped off with additional crab meat and a chive buerre blanc. \n\nFor me, a good buerre blanc should be light and airy, yet rich and thick enough to coat whatever food it's drizzled on. \n\nThis sauce was darker and more orange, I've never seen any buerre blanc (means \"white butter\" in French cooking) that dark before. It looked very similar to the sundried tomato sauce that was in my Chicken Paige dish. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA#DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\n\nBROILED PORTABELLO MUSHROOMS W/RED WINE VINAIGRETTE ($9.95):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=07F2D7XHPQxYjnyOYYg6zw\nDressed w/basil oil, fresh diced tomatoes and \"fresh mozzarella.\" \nThe mozzarella had no flavor and was a bit on the dry side. Some cubes crumbled very easily, almost like feta cheese. \n\nWhen I see \"fresh mozzarella\" on the menu, I'm expecting the cheese to have a higher moisture content, resulting in a more soft to semi-soft cheese. This was not the case. \n\nRAW OYSTERS (6 for $14.95):\nPlump fresh oysters. 'Nuff said.\n\nOYSTERS ROCKERFELLER (6 for $15.95):\nEveryone raves about this dish, so of course we had to get a couple orders for our large party. It was okay. I got chopped herbs, bread crumbs and butter. I wasn't wowed by this dish. \n\nFRIED OYSTERS w/malt vinegar tartar sauce (6 for $11.95): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=NwbMJiBs__-RuwiMIjRLLA\nOut of the 3 oyster dishes, this was the one I was looking forward to. Like the raw oyster and oyster rockerfeller, these fried oysters were also plump and juicy. \n\nThe crust (although very greasy) had a nice crunch to it, but that's where the buck stops. \nThere's nothing more unappetizing than biting into a crunchy fried oyster, only to be disappointed when you find out that you're chewing on some RAW BATTER. \nPerhaps they should go back to the basics and use deep-fryer thermometer? Just a thought. \n\nFRESH SPINACH SALAD ($8.95):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=MWLoXcv3T_MXTLgqCp2Ubg\nThis was a favorite amongst most of us (I only got input from our side of the long table, the other half of our large party didn't mention anything about it). \n\nThis spinach salad had a mixture of chopped bacon, eggs, kalamata olives, and artichokes. That's my kind of salad! Can't go wrong with crispy bacon! The citrus vinaigrette was the perfect addition to the salty bacon and kalamata olives. I enjoyed this dish very much. \n\nIronic that my favorite part of the entire meal was a damn salad.....especially when I don't even like veggies. That's actually the very section that I avoid like the plague when I dine out."

I opted for the bone in rib-eye,while the lady chose seafood.  The steak literally melted in my mouth, while the side of Au Gratin potatoes served as a welcome compliment to the meal.  The wife raved about her salmon as we also slowly enjoyed a recommended bottle of bubbly.  \n\nService was beyond amazing and the atmosphere was beyond comfortable during the entire dining experience which is important for a Vegas fine dining rookie like myself.  \n\nHopefully, I'll be back downtown in the future and will be able to avoid the football full of liquor long enough to appreciate Vic and Anthony's for a second time."

It was only due booking a hotel for a last minute trade show that we found ourselves at this hotel and had no other choice for dinner as all other reservations in the city were completely filled. But I am happy to say Vic and Anthony's became the shining, mouth-watering, reputation boosting, savior of my entire stay.\n\nI've had Morton's, Mastro's, and Ruth Chris, and honestly on more than one of my visits to these places, I've had to send my steak back due to it being overcooked or undercooked, and once received the most horrid service.\n\nThe 21oz bone in rib eye was nothing less than DIVINE. And standing at 5'1\" 105 lbs, I ate every single last bite of it, down to scraping off the bone. \n\nEvery single bite was so tender, juicy, and full of flavor and as consistent as it could be throughout. I've found in other rib eyes, the outer rim of the steak was always much more well done than the center. Our waiter was so helpful and suggested that we order the steak rare, since the plate is very hot and it will continue to cook at the table. I am so thankful we did this as my steak was a consistent medium rare throughout the entire meal. \n\nWe shared a crabcake for an appetizer, and all I have to say is you MUST get this. I was worried about it being too heavy before our entrees but there is very little breading, so it was more crab than cake, which worked wonderfully.\n\nWe were a party of 3 and ordered a side of broccoli (which comes out in 3 GIANT florets, simply cooked) and a side of the duck fat potatoes. The duck fat potatoes were fingerling potatoes soaked in a confit, and i simply must order anything and everything with the word \"confit\". However, these were a bit underwhelming. Definitely delicious but they actually just tasted like breakfast potatoes. Which felt out of place with everything else we were eating.\n\nWe also ordered a side of bearnaise and peppercorn sauce for our steaks. I ended up not using either as I thought the steak was perfectly delicious on its own.\n\nI guess I'll be coming back to the Golden Nugget after all."

I wanted a vermouth - they didn't have the very specific one I was looking for but they gave me a short pour of a really perfect replacement on the house. My partner and I both ordered steak, he started with the roasted bacon and I ordered the bisque. \n\nThe bacon was just absolutely sublime, but the portion was far too large. It was a full 8oz of bacon, people. In two rashers. They were enormous. But the fat rendered perfectly, and they really were delicious. The bisque was standard steakhouse lobster bisque - good, but nothing lifechanging, which is fine.\n\nMy steak was cooked perfectly, but there just was something...not great about it. It was a bit chewy, and required a bearnaise. Last year when I was in Vegas I went to Cut and had the steak I compare all steaks to, and this one didn't meet that standard. \n\nWe ordered coffees, and split.

Please do yourself a favor and just try this place. It is our new favorite! The prices on the strip are outrageous for what you get and quite a number don't deliver. This place is worth every penny for a special evening. My wife and I went recently to celebrate her birthday this year. The original Vic and Anthony's in Houston is consistently ranked as one of the best in the country. This is their second location, if I remember correctly, and it is every bit as good. Before I say anything about the food, let me just express how incredible the service was. From beginning to end, my wife said it was the best service she has ever experienced and she used to work in the food and service industry for years. They hire excellent people and they will take care of you. The restaurant is located in the best hotel off the strip, the Golden Nugget, and it has a beautifully focused menu. To start the lobster bisque was perfect and the crab cake - Best I have ever had. Furthermore, the drinks are excellent and well priced. The steaks are all cooked to perfection and are served all by themselves, with an optional sauce, topping or any of several sides you can order. The key here is that the steaks are of such high quality and seasoned so immaculately that they don't need anything. I am not a filet man, as like most chefs, I agree it has less flavor than other cuts. However, my surf and turf was sublime! My wife's new york was equally good. We finished with dessert wine and a killer red velvet cake. Everything will be so good you will have to share dishes just so everyone can try a few things."

(B-).\n\nThe hostess greeting was OK, if a bit lackluster but we found it odd that a couple who checked in right behind us without a reservation were seated ahead of us (we had reservations). Give her a C.\n\nOur waiter was competent but offered little help in menu discussion, showed no personality and seemed to be doing little other than going through the motions. Another C.\n\nLandry's and The Golden Nugget need much more from this place if they want to compete with the strip.  Our meal at Andiamo (at the D) was far superior in every way."

I was in Vegas for the weekend (go figure) and one of my friends said he has heard rave reviews about Vic & Anthony's, however once I heard it was in Downtown Vegas at the Nugget I questioned how good would it be? Afterall I am not really a downtown Vegas type of guy but the other guys wanted to check it out so I went along. Decor is your typical dark wood and paneling steakhouse with lots of old photos on the walls, nothing too spectacular. The food on the other hand was very very good. everyone ordered a different cut of meat from a petite fillet to a huge bone-in rib eye, each with different preparation and temp from rare to medium well and everyone's food came out to their liking. Prices are not bad at all especially when copared to steakhouses on the strip. Now if you are on a budget this is a great place to eat some great food but don't forget to factor in a cab or limo ride fromt he strip to downtown. If you are staying downtown then for sure give it a shot."

            "review": "(Review based on 3.5 stars)\n\nLocated at The Golden Nugget in Downtown Las Vegas, directly across from the Chocolate Box and very close to the hotel lobby check in.\n\nMy husband and I arrived here for dinner on Christmas day while spending a little vacation getaway in Las Vegas. We arrived right on time for our 5:30 pm reservations (another couple had walked in and asked how long would the wait be since they did not have a reservation and the seating hostess told him it would be about 45 minutes). \n\nAfter we were seated and greeted by our server (unfortunately I do not recall his name), we were given menus. We ended up ordering:\n\nSourdough Bread- This basket of complementary bread was pretty \"meh\". Although it was served warm, it did not have much of a taste. It is served with butter (with good reason). But since we were both feeling hungry, we ended up eating 1/2 of it. \n\nJump Lump Crab Cake, $21 prior to tax- Although this crab cake was a large size (and a fair amount to share for 2 as an appetizer), I wasn't really impressed with it. I thought the breading was not seasoned well. But the crab pieces itself was good. The butter sauce on this crab cake was good but the crab was good all by itself. I wouldn't say this is worth ordering again.\n\nRoasted Salmon, $32 prior to tax- This salmon is served on a bed of potato puree (mashed potatoes) and a delicious lump of crab. This dish is also served with asparagus. I had requested for the asparagus to be steamed. According to our server, normally the asparagus is sauteed in butter. I thought this salmon was perfectly cooked. The sauce was wonderful and I liked the diced tomatoes on the salmon. However I didn't find the capers to really enhance the flavor of the salmon and rather overpowered the delicate flavors of the fish. The crab cake that was served was much better seasoned and better tasting than our appetizer. The portion of this entree is more than perfect for one person. \n\nPrime Ribeye (16 oz), $47 prior to tax- My husband ordered this (since he is a big steak fan and we are in a steak house). We were both actually surprised that this prime ribeye entree was just meat and no side like my salmon. When we had dined at other steakhouses in the past, the steak entree always comes with some kind of vegetable and/ or starch. So this was a little disappointing. In general, the prime rib was cooked a bit more than my husband wanted (he ordered it medium rare). But the steak was still juicy. It would have been nice to have an accompaniment of sauces to be served with this steak (unfortunately that is not free). \n\nHaricot Verts, $10 prior to tax- I requested to have these green beans steamed. Normally this would be served with a buttery sauce. I thought these green beans were cooked perfectly. It was nice to be able to taste the natural sweetness and tenderness of the vegetables. \n\n--------------------------\n(Total= $150 after tax and tip)\n\nThis was quite a special meal for us to celebrate Christmas. Our server in general was friendly. But was not quite as attentive, but that seems to be the norm for steak houses (so that isn't what caused me to deduct stars on this rating). \n\nWe were disappointed with my husband's entree not coming with a side dish, also disappointed that his steak was cooked a little more than he had requested. We were also disappointed with the bread they served (thank goodness it was free at least because we have been to a steakhouse that served bread for a $5 charge and it wasn't even good). Another thing that did annoy my husband was that there is no restroom inside this restaurant. And so you have to use the restaurant in the casino (a short walk, but you still have to leave the restaurant to use it). And lastly, the crab cake we ordered as an appetizer was not worth it. Overall. this place is worth a solid 3.5 stars.\n\nThe couple next to our table did order the bread pudding and it truly looked amazing but we were too full to make an order. If you do come here, I would recommend you consider making room for this dessert. \n\nBy the way, this restaurant will validate your parking ticket for 3 hours. (Parking is not free at the Golden Nugget unfortunately but with validation and for hotel guest only it is free)."

The wine list is fantastic as well.  The dark paneled atmosphere and big leather chairs make you comfortable to sit down and enjoy your meal.  \n\nThis past visit (5/3/10) was no exception, we were dining with clients and part of our group was running way behind.  The hostess was able to work with us on our reservation and we happily split the time difference between the bar and munching on apps at the table, again perfect!  This is a steakhouse not to be missed!"

We decided not to risk it with my 2 year old niece. Having said that, when we were at the restaurant, we did see children that's about 5 or 6 years old. So, parents:  use your best judgement :)"

I was completely blown away by the gorgeous woodwork, the ambient lighting, and overall old school \"fancy\" feel. The hostesses were great and welcoming. Our server was amazing. He recommended great wines and let us have tastes when we were indecisive of what to order. We were lucky to have stumbled upon the distinctive dining offer. What an amazing deal. We first started off with the lobster bisque. My goodness was that ever decadent. So flavorful with big chunks of lobster. They did not skimp with the serving size either. Next, we had the 8 oz filet mignon. Perfectly cooked to our desires of medium rare and medium. They also had this peppercorn sauce on the side. It was a perfect complement to the meat. Not overpowering, but a great enhancement. We chose the broccoli and au gratin potatoes as our sides. I was awe-struck by the portion sizes. The broccoli was HUGE. I am not exaggerating either. It had an awesome flavor- far from your average steamed broccoli taste. The au gratin was rich and decadent. All of this yummy goodness paired with a nice, generous pour of Malbec. For dessert, BT had the bread pudding, which he LOVED and I had the lemon sorbet. What I appreciated most is that our server was very concerned with my allergies, and went to find out what I could have in lieu of the pre-set dessert choices. The service was top notch and we never wanted for anything. This was a very special experience of amazing service, food, and setting. Definitely worth the 151 dollar tab (not including tip) So, Treat yo' self to Vic & Anthony's. You deserve it."

We sat at a table tucked in a balcony area, where our server, Ben, gave us superb service as he provided us with dinner specials, suggestions for drink pairings, a little bit of history, and entertaining jokes throughout our evening. \n\nThe four of us shared a bottle of Pinot Noir that Ben recommended. We followed this delicious and smooth wine with individual cocktails, I had the Spiced Pear Martini, which might not have been the best choice to pair with my filet and lobster tail, but it hit a great spot my taste buds were desiring. \n\nWe shared a calamari appetizer that was mixed with shishito peppers. The plate was just right for the four of us, especially since two of us aren't big fans of this particular seafood. \n\nFor our second course, we chose different salads. I enjoyed the heirloom tomato penzanella, which seemed to be a variation of caprese. It was rich, light, and scrumptious. Around the rest of the table were Caesar salaf and Spinach salad. \n\nThe main course consisted of two specials of 8oz filet and I think 12oz lobster tails with fingerling potatoes and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (yellowfoot, bluefoot...and one other that I can't recall at the moment, mostly because I have them to my man to enjoy since he is the only fun-guy I like! lol). The other two plates were filled with porter house ribeyes that my cousin and my husband savored until they couldn't eat anymore. Yes, leftover meat taken back to the room and chewed up for breakfast. \n\nOur additional sides were au gratin potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and in house made creamed corn. We covered the table with our feast, everything set in a wonderful presentation, flavored amazingly, and eaten with great delight. \n\nBen paid attention when we mentioned we were there to celebrate my cousin and her husband's wedding anniversary, and he generously brought out a creme brulee with a candle. It was just the right amount of sweet for four spoons that filled us to our limit. \n\nIt was a fabulous evening of food, conversation, service and overall memory making that the four of us will get to share and enjoy the rest of our days."

Demitri's is my favorite mix, but for a cocktail that pairs so well with meat, I'd have expected a house-made mix. And, \"spicy\" meant extra tabasco, not the right answer in our age of scotch bonnet, bird and ghost peppers. \n\nThe soups: fantastic. I ordered one for my dining companion, took a taste, and was so impressed that I immediately ordered their other soup option for myself, to try both. \n\nThe large ribeye was delicious and well-cooked, but I have to be straight to my readers about the bone-marrow sauce option. I chose to come here specifically for that sauce, and I can't fault it for being what it is: I just had to learn, somewhere, sometime, that it's a black, salty, sticky sauce with chunks of greyish paste-y marrow. \n\nMy dining companion had the salmon, and was relieved that the Roaring Fork's is better. It'd be a shame to have raised the bar on one's favorite entree at such an inaccessible place. The grilled wild mushrooms came in nice variety, three of four types.\n\nDessert, the flourless chocolate cake, was too rich for words, of course, and fabulous, but if you're reading this in Austin, go to the Mesa Grill in Northwest Hills for its rival.\n\nWe went for the old-school atmosphere and the interesting menu, but the service was top-flight, the best waitstaff I've had outside Paris, the kind of service that makes you remember that serving can be one hell of a classy profession."

I have been to other steak house on the strip and they do no t compare in taste or price to what Vic and Anthony's has to offer. I always sit at the bar and the tenders are more than friendly and professional. I have asked for slight changes in my app and the kitchen will always accommodate, the filet always cooked to perfection. They serve a drink in a tumbler. Always good! Though someone in another review complained the key lime pie was too crusty, the key lime pie has a crust and the actual filling is the tartness it should be."

They were extremely cheesy in a good way, and also very big. We've been told so many times \"it's big enough to share\"  only to be totally disappointed. These are! No worries though as they were so good we ate most of them and took the meager amount left home. \n\nWe had the creme brulee and chocolate mousse for dessert. Both were very good and the creme brulee in particular was large enough for two. \n\nThe bill was over $200 and I didn't bat an eye because everything was so good. That's what I expect in a high end steakhouse. Vic and Anthony's completely delivered in every aspect from food to service."

My husband had the steak and lobster special and I had the stuffed salmon. Both entrees were like nothing I have ever had. Very unique and delicious! Our server (and I'm going to butcher her name, Ayko??) was fabulous. Gave us amazing drink and menu recommendations, and was at the top of her game with service. Best server we have ever had.

I had the filet mignon 8 oz which was cooked to perfection and a side of the Brussels sprouts which was great. When the food came to our table (of 4), it was all extremely hot which makes you feel like it just came out of the kitchen and straight to your table, none of this waiting under a heat lamp for service. One of my friends happened to look online and find a great 3 course alternate menu for a significantly cheaper price than if you ordered it all separately.  It was presented to us by the server from her billfold when we inquired about it, leading us to believe it is a unadvertised special. It must be asked for. A few small complaints, which are actually pretty minor, the wine list is veeeeeery long. Almost overwhelmingly long, it took us forever just to decide on a wine to enjoy with dinner. Also, you must physically leave the restaurant and walk through the casino to find a bathroom.  However our server was great and the staff was fantastic. Plates cleared within seconds of finishing.

Even though we were staying at the NY, NY on the Strip, we ventured into the old part of town for this meal at the Golden Nugget. After the $30 cab ride, we kept our fingers crossed that the meal was as great as we'd read about and were not disappointed.\n\nAmbience: The restaurant exudes that traditional steak house feeling! The dark wood, leather, and dim lighting made it the perfect environment to enjoy a lovely meal.  They even had very beautiful stained glass ceiling pieces in the area where we were seated that were unlike anything I'd ever seen. The restaurant was busy, but the tables were nicely spaced and my husband and I never felt as though we were being invaded upon by other guests. There was even a large table nearby, but again no issues!\n\nFood: We decided to enjoy our bread and butter and also a cup of their lobster bisque which was perfect. Off to a great start! We also ordered two reasonably priced glasses of merlot (recommended by our waiter, Mario) from Washington State.  It was so tasty that we bought a bottle upon our return home and have bookmarked the winery (Sagelands) in our favorites. My husband ordered the rib eye (rare) and I ordered the filet (medium). These steaks have to be among the very best we've ever had, and we've dined at several of the finer steakhouses in the US.  The meat was seasoned perfectly, and so juicy that we savored every bite until the end. We chose the asparagus spears as our veggie to share, and they too were wonderfully seasoned (huge stalks, by the way!) We did look the dessert menu over, and there were many choices that looked appealing but we passed. \n\nService: As others have mentioned, the service was top notch. Our waiter, Mario was friendly, knowledgeable, and visited our table just the right amount of times during our meal. We were so impressed by the quality of his service that we asked to speak to the manager on our way out to share our compliments. Needless to say the manager was concerned at first that something had gone awry with our meal, but was very happy that our first experience had been so positive.\n\nBottom line: While expensive, Vic and Anthony's triumphs over the typical Vegas steak. Make the trip! I know the next time we are in Vegas; we will definitely stop in for a repeat performance."

We were not disappointed.  We both thought it wouldn't be too busy on a Tuesday evening, but we were wrong.  It was about an hour to hour and a half wait, but that is on us, since we didn't make reservations.  They did take my cell phone # and would call when our table was ready.  We headed out to the casino.   I got a call after about an hour and we headed back to the restaurant.  The atmosphere is dark, quite, very nice.  We received bread and water almost immediately after we were seated.  Our waiter came over and went through the specials and menu.  We ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad for an appetizer.  I ordered the special which was a filet with three shrimp in scampi sauce, garlic mashed potatoes,and sauteed fresh vegetables.  My wife opted for the ribeye with baked potato.  We received our appetizer quickly and it had been split onto two plates which was nice.  Our steaks arrived shortly after we finished the appetizer.  Our waiter asked us to cut into them to check that they were done to our liking and they were.  The filet was melt in your mouth tender.  The veggies were a little under cooked, but I like them al dente.  The mashed potatoes had way too much garlic for my taste and I really like garlic.  My wifes steak had that nice intense beef flavor and was cooked perfectly.  The skin on her baked potato was a little tough, but inside was light and fluffy.  The service was awesome and we had a truly pleasant dining experience and were able to de-stress after traveling."

This was actually my first time walking through the Golden Nugget after the renovations and it was great to have had a dose of Fremont after spending so much time in the past few years on the Strip.  Alas I digress!! \n\nOkay... so, you come to Vic & Anthony's for the fine dining, great steaks and dark atmosphere that really gives it that nice touch of \"Oooh, fancy-smancy!\"\n\nV&A delivers on all fronts, walking in across the selection of cuts and lobster aquarium, through the dark corridors and to a nicely spaced dining area you really get a sense that you are in for a treat. \n\nThe service is wonderful, our server was very accommodating and attentive.  Our food came out fast and drinks were consistently filled to the brim.  Absolutely NO complaints here, I would say the service is some of the best I've received in all of Vegas.  FANTASTIC!\n\nThe meat (the important part right?) is great but not pinnacle of all steak houses in my opinion.  I ordered the rib eye ($55) and had a taste of the bone in cut that clocked in at about $69 dollars that night for a 21oz cut (Market Price).  I enjoyed the marbled taste of both ribeye but the flavoring was a bit peppery in some areas as the seasoning did not appear to have been spread across the entire cut as well as I had hoped.  I had a chance to sample the filet mignon as well and that was great, but again not something that I immediately fell in love with.   Overall a very fine experience and I will definitely be back, however when it comes to my FAVORITE steakhouses I'd have to still say Ruth's Chris and Craftsteak are still my favorites.  \n\nDefinitely worth the try for EVERYTHING as an overall package.

My wife and I made reservations for 9:45. We are greeted by the hostess who was very friendly. The dining room is not very large, but it did not take away from the fact that it has a very intimate / romantic atmosphere. Perfect since the wife and I were there celebrating our 5th year wedding anniversary that night. The room is dim lit, with candles burning on every table. \n\nAs we are escorted to our table, every single waiter is gretting us with \"Good evening\", which was a very classy touch.\n\nWe are seated and served our bread basket. The bread alone was so fresh and warm. We start looking through the menu and I plan a strategy. My wife is set on the New York steak which is pretty big. I know for a fact she will not finish it. So I order the 8 oz filet mignon. That way I will eat my steak, and finish her left overs! \n\nOur waiter finally comes around and addresse's me as Mr. \"my last name\" the entire evening which made me feel like a big shot. My wife's New York steak is at market price for $46.50. My filet mignon went for $38.50.\n\nOn the side we ordered the Au Gratin Potatoes.\n\nLet me just say that my plan worked perfectly. My wife did not finish her steak, so I got to enjoy them both. I order my filet medium, and my wife requested her's medium well. The steak's literally melted like butter with every bite. Whatever seasoning they used was simply amazing which only enhanced the flavor,. By far the  best tasting steak I have ever had. I will consider it a crime for someone to come to Vegas, and n ot dine at Vic & Anthony's.\n\nThe Au Gratin Potatoes were incredible as well. They were baked with cheese on top.\n\nThe sides are portioned to share by the way. Very generous portions.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the croissant bread pudding. You seriously do not know what you are missing if you dont try this piece of sweetness. According to our waiter,it won the dessert of the year award. I believe it. It was too good.\n\nIt is a pricey restaurant, but well worth every pennie!\n\nWe will no doubt be dining here again on our next Vegas trip.."

Sometimes these prime or prime prime meats have chunks of fat in them; not this though, it was a nice and even. I even got the port peppercorn sauce on the side just in case but it wasn't really needed.\n\nParents had the Filet Mignon and Veal Chop.   I think my dad liked the chop since it disappeared pretty quickly.\n\nGot the au gratin potatoes and the risotto (crab based) as sides.  The Au Gratin Potatoes had that nice deep cheddar flavor with a good crust as well.  I'm not a real 'crab' person but I appreciated how the risotto was so smooth with that good 'crabby' flavor.  Both sides were so tasty with a depth of flavor that seemed truffle oil-ish, but it wasn't overwhelming (so probably not?).\n\nEven though we were full from that, we got the Caramel croissant bread pudding.  It comes with a scoop of ice cream and toffee chips in the sauce (see pict). Each bite was sweet and succulent.\n\nAlthough price is usually a factor in my rating, this place's rating will be different.  The quality of each dish at this steakhouse matches the best steakhouse dinner I have ever had before (Mastros BH). Even being in downtown, it crushed other steaks I've had on the Strip (Craftsteak, Prime).  I haven't tried the very top steakhouses in LV but I know if I want some great steak in the future and I'm over here in downtown, I'll try to come back here again."

But as the night was, I was in the company of 4 older people, all of who were not about to indulge in a steak with me and I was not about to order one of those bad boys myself.  But it looked SOOOO GOOD in the showcase.  \n\nI did have the tartar though, which they did up in small chunks, seasoned, and plated on a salt brick.  Very nice going down.  Between the 5 of us, we had seafood, seafood, and seafood.  I won't comment on the Alaskan King Crab legs because I think that they are all the same.  The AKC pasta though, was wonderfully light and fresh.  My dad had the special which was scallops, shrimp and swordfish over polenta with a baked potato on the side.  Perfectly done.  HUGE SIDES! I suggest sharing, especially if you order the mashed potatoes.   \n\nSalmon was also done well.  \n\nNice ambiance - dark like a real classy restaurant, but like Hawaii, because it's Vegas, the dress code is not that strict.  I wore shorts. But in true Vegas fashion, there were large screen tvs through out the place that played sports non stop.  Service was great, quick and friendly.\n\nI look forward to going back with a meat eater and killing one of those $90 porterhouses or $60 rib eyes."

The service was top rate, but the steak was well below par, and their was a group of a dozen or so that overflowed from the small bar and gathered around our dining table.......not a great setting and a piss poor meal. My wife's meal was fine, but a steak cooked medium should have some sort of juices remaining.....dontcha think?  Not again!"

            "review": "The bone-in ribeye had the best flavor and texture of steak I have ever had. Being a native Houstonian, I've had my share of steak! I ordered my ribeye medium rare (which at Vic & Anthony's is nice and pink) and it literally melted in my mouth. I hardly had to chew--it just melted! The steak cuts like a tender piece of meat, but when it hits your mouth is it truly similar to the texture of butter. Unbelievable. I never quite understood what people meant by comparing foods to butter, until I tasted Vic & Anthony's steaks. The meat isn't overly seasoned or overly salted---its a perfect balance (maybe just a dash of salt and pepper) with a quality cut of meat. When you taste a steak from Vic & Anthony's, you are tasting the meat in its best form--not covered up with a bunch of spices and seasonings. Simplicity at its finest!\n\nBe careful though---once you eat there, you'll have risen the bar so high on good eats, that you may have a hard time tolerating food from other Las Vegas eateries. No matter where we went, nothing we ordered compared to the experience of our Vic & Anthony's meal. \n\nThe asparagus and the mushrooms were wonderful accompaniments. The asparagus was medium-sized, lightly seasoned and al dente. The mushrooms tasted like they were tossed in a wine sauce of some sort. Served sauteed and whole, these mushrooms were firm and absolutely delicious! A fun appetizer to order is the steak tartare. Delicate and whimsical, the steak tartare is served with a mildly spicy ground mustard, chips and an egg yolk in the center (which becomes like a rich sauce when you break it open). A slab of salt that resembled marble was used as a platter for this appetizer, which added some light salty flavor and lots of fun to this dish. \n\nThe decor inside Vic & Anthony's is dim, warm, soothing and elegant--as is the music playing in the background. Be sure to check out the photography on the walls, as they are all tributes to Las Vegas history. Beautiful restaurant, and excellent food. You are making a huge mistake if you miss out on Vic & Anthony's!"

            "review": "My girlfriend and I had been planning a trip to Las Vegas for quite some time and finally the day arrived where we were in our car and driving through the desert. I can be classified as a meticulous planner. I had everything planned from what shows we were going to see, to where we were going to stay to where we were going to eat. My girlfriend and I are HUGE fans of Steakhouses and I knew Vic & Anthony's happened to be in the lobby of the Hotel we were staying at the 'Golden Nugget.' I figured since we were driving around it only made sense to enjoy a dinner close to our Hotel this just happened to be in our Hotel. Quite honestly even if this Steakhouse was the other side of town we would of driven there, it is that good. \n\nI made our reservation for Vic & Anthony's using the Yelp feature on my phone. We arrived and from the moment we checked in with the receptionist we were treated like absolute royalty. I due honestly believe we were given the 'STAR' treatment because of the whole 'Yelp' reservation. \n\nAs other patrons were being seated on the 1st floor of the restaurant we were taken to a small 2nd level that overlooked the entire restaurant almost like you were on a balcony with curtains obstructing the view of the commoners below you=) As described on the Vic & Anthony's website 'Our Las Vegas locations offers a Private Tasting Room in an elegant setting, featuring beautiful wine country murals. The tasting room will seat up to 18 guests, and features our award-winning cuisine with and extensive wine list.' We were the only ones seated in section until just before our dessert arrived. We were also dressed the part which added with the 'Yelp' check-in was the icing on the cake. The d\u00e9cor was stunning. The chairs we sat in were leather with 'brass tacks,' the menus were hard/thick leather. The music playing was everything 'Old School' Las Vegas offers you, it was a medley of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and various other artists from the day. You honestly felt like you had been transported back to the 1950's, you were literally looking at the front door of the restaurant want for Bugsy Siegel or Al Capone to walk in the front door. \n\nFrom the moment we sat down we were treated great by the staff. If you asked for anything they were on the ball and it was done. The staff brought out fresh bread with whipped butter and hard butter upon request. Our waiter 'Hector' arrived soon after our bread did and 'Hector' was one incredible waiter/server. Hector had us laughing, smiling and made our night so much more special than it already was. I am not a drinker at all and nor is my girlfriend but we will enjoy a glass of wine every now and then. We immediately asked 'Hector' what wine pairing would go great with a Filet Mignon, Hector quickly suggested 2006 Rutherford Hill Winery Napa Valley which was amazing. As I stated above I do not see what all the hub-bub is about wine and how is pairs with a meal until this glass of wine and this meal. The wine 'Hector' suggested was fantastic. It was so good (and by 'GOOD' I mean 'GREAT' and by 'GREAT' I mean 'AMAZING.') that several days after we left Las Vegas I actually called the restaurant to get the name of the wine we drank so we could purchase it on our own. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were debating if we were going to split a Cesar Salad or also order Tomato & Mozzarella as an appetizer. We asked 'Hector' who asked what we were planning on having for dinner. We told him and he suggested we go with something lighter, we ended up just splitting a Cesar Salad 'Good call Hector.' For an entr\u00e9e my girlfriend and I both ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon, my girlfriend ordered hers Medium rare, I ordered mine Medium. All of the side dishes are A' la Carte. My girlfriend and I decided to go with the Wild Mushrooms & Sea Salt French fries. \n\nOur meal was fantastic; you could literally cut through your piece of meat with a spoon if you wanted to. The steak was cooked to perfection. The edges of the steak had a char to it that complimented the Filet so well. I have been to several top end Steakhouses and nothing even comes close to Vic & Anthony's, I mean they are not even close to being in the same Ballpark. \n\nRight when my girlfriend and I thought we could not eat another bite of food 'Hector' brought the dessert menu and we decided to split a piece of cheesecake. Be advised one piece of cheesecake can easily be split between 2-3 people, so do not eat with your eyes here, order 1 piece=) We ordered out cheesecake with the blueberry dressing on the side and it was simply mind boggling it was so good. \n\nThere are several other Steakhouses I want to try in Las Vegas but it is so hard to give them a shot when you know you are going to get such great service and such good quality of food at Vic & Anthony's. I am counting the day's until I can come back here and have another meal. \n\nMy girlfriend and I wanted to thank 'Hector' and the entire staff for making our meal such a special one."

The hostess guided me to the bar, where a random waiter ensured that I got a seat. I ate at the bar -- Noah was the barkeep that night -- and wow he delivered. Noah has a deep knowledge of the food menu, as well as cocktails and wine. He even went so far as to sample up several different wine varietals that could pair perfectly with the steak. \n\nI went with the 8 ounce filet and lobster tail combo. Both came out superbly. Many restaurants err on the side of cooking a medium-rare steak too long. Not here: it came out just the perfect shade of deep red in the middle, yet still warm, and nice pinkness on the outside. The lobster tail was fluffy and tender -- no need for a knife, just melted off the fork. The chef himself even made an appearance to talk meat with the bar patrons. \n\nI am telling you, treat yourself to an epic dinner and get in here."

We have dined at 3 starred Michelin restaurants, and we have NEVER EVER seen an unholy markup on wine as we did at this restaurant. In fact, the table next to us were saying the same thing. They were in total disbelief. Of course, there is significant mark up at restaurants for wine, but this was just plain insulting.\n\nMy husband got the $155 steak which was a rare beef and that was great. I got the prime bone in rib eye, and was severely disappointed. I get bone in ribeye regularly (it's my cut) at Fleming's, Mastro's, Ruths Chris and other high end prime steakhouses, and the bone is always long and runs across the steak. Here, it was a \"bone\" that was barely an inch! How is that possible? It just didn't look right or taste right--it lacked seasoning, and it was 3/4 fat. Rib eye is a fatty cut of meat, but I get it regularly and never experienced this much fat.\n\nThe sides were disappointing other than the mushrooms. Brussel sprouts lacked seasoning, duck fat potatoes would have been superb, but some pieces were not fully cooked. Au gratin potatoes were okay, but the consistency of the cheese was like Velveeta. I prefer a firmer cheese with a crunch at the bubbling top. Also, the creamed corn was salty. Weird.\n\nOur bill came to about $550. Not worth it. Our server Luciano was spectacular, or I would have given it a much lower rating."

I know I have. \n\nWhat I really liked about dining at Vic & Anthonys, apart from the food (which was fabulous, more on this in a minute) was that I didn't get that \"fishbowl feeling.\"  Not once. And the service was just as good as any of the five-star dining experiences on the strip. There were waiters, bussers, and servers filling your cup at every turn, never intrusive, always on the ball. I was impressed. \n\nThe ambiance is old-school Vegas steakhouse, with old black & white photographs of celebrities gracing the walls, dark wood, wrought iron details, and lighting which made it cozy but not so dark that you couldnt read your menu (dont you hate that?)\n\nWe ordered the lobster bisque with cognac - some of the best bisque Ive ever had - and the quail for an appetizer. Id never tried quail before, it was tender, juicy, and the skin was crisped perfectly. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it!\n\nI ordered the stuffed salmon in an attempt to eat (somewhat) healthfully. Salmon can be iffy, but I figured this place got a 4.5 stars, its bound to be good. I was mot disappointed. Wow, was it good! Lots of capers, just the right amount of sauce, i savored every bite. Surprisingly, the mashed potatoes were some of the best Ive ever had at a restaurant. My hubby was sneaking bites of them off my plate!\n\nHe ordered the special, a snapper dish that he also enjoyed immensely. \n\nThen we shared the vanilla bean creme brulee, which was big enough for two and also some of the best creme brulee ive ever had. \n\nThats three items that were the top of the list for me, EVER. Id say that makes this place a 5+ stars. \n\nA few side notes: there seemed to be a lot of men dining here with other men. I think the ambiance made them feel more comfortable (back to the goldfish bowl thing again). \nAlso, it WAS pricey. Most of the entrees were in the $40- $50 range. A few were lower, like the chicken and salmon. The alcohol was pricey too, the low end was $15 per glass. You're not going to get away with less than $100 for two. More like $200. But well worth it for a special occasion. \n\nHubby said he'd love to make this his go-to place for special occasions. I wholeheartedly agree.  Kudos to the Golden Nugget. I really enjoyed dining here and will certainly do so again."

The d\u00e9cor and ambiance are terrific, but that fell apart.  We were dressed for a 5 star meal, but not everyone in restaurant shared our wardrobe.  There was literally 5 or 6 tables were men were wearing ratty cargo shorts and tee shirts.  I saw a woman in yoga pants.  I was very disappointed to pay $50 for a steak and see someone that was barely dressed for Chipotle.    Our waiter, Jay, started out great, but fell apart later (details to follow).  We both ordered the same steak (NY Strip).   The price was $55 including the blue cheese topping.  Ala Carte, this is hefty, but I am willing to pay for quality.    My girlfriends steak was cooked well, tasted great, but was tough (very tough - we mentioned it to the manager but he did not seem concerned about it).  My steak I ordered rare.  It was medium well to well when it came out.  I cut it in half and called Jay over.  He agreed and cooked me a new one.  The steak part deux was not tough (like my girlfriends), cooked perfectly, BUT, I had asked me to put blackening seasoning on it.  I took a bite and had a Pierce Brosnan reaction in Ms. Doubtfire when his shrimp was too spicy.  They used Cajun Blackening.  This seasoning made the steak way to salty (and I like salt) and very spicy (and I like spicy).  I was not what I expected.  I informed Jay about the seasoning and he said he would investigate.  After that, we surmised Jay entered the witness protection program because we did not see him until the bill came.  This was strange, because we were discrete about our concerns.  When he did bring the bill I asked him about the seasoning and he said 'oh yeah' they ran out of regular blackening and used the Cajun instead.  True story.  I finished the steak.  When Jay did finally emerge from the shadows he inexplicably gave the check to my girlfriend (she quickly shuttle passed it to me so no damage was done to her wallet).\nThe check included $0 off for our issues.  For newbie diners, this is NOT usual for well-dressed well-mannered diner where the kitchen screws the pooch.\nWhile I am piling on complaints, one more.  There is no restroom in the restaurant.  The restroom is literally half way across a crowded, smoky, dare I say dingy casino and that restroom, well let's just say it was not as clean as it could have been.  Again, for a high end dining place, I should not have to walk 4 minutes one way and get some free longshot horse advice from a guy in the next urinal smoking a cigar.  Not what I was expecting.\nOverall, maybe we got unlucky.  However, I would recommend avoiding this place for 2 reasons.  1. Do not support a fine dining restaurant that does not enforce a dress code and 2. Do not support a restaurant that cannot resolve a problem.\nEvery casino hotel has a steakhouse, avoid this one AND the Circus Circus steakhouse.  Same problem there - no dress code, no problem resolution."

Sure, they are pricey ($42 each plus $14 for the \"Oscar\" style) but pretty much all food in Vegas is expensive. You'll likely forget your $25 breakfast, but you'll definitely remember the steak at Vic & Anthony's. \n\nWe ordered some wine and other drinks with our meals, and had cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. It was a bit of an odd presentation, served on a plate instead of a bowl, but that allowed for maximum br\u00fbl\u00e9ed surface area lol.

As if Vegas doesn't have enough to write about, this little gem is in one of the remaining standouts of what some call \"Old Vegas\".  The meal got off to a great start at the bar as we waited for our table.  The service was fast, the drinks were well made and naturally they were top shelf.  I was particularly pleased with the professional look and feel of the place.  Its very old school, mafioso, dark, white linen, with the sounds of clinking wine glasses and lively conversation in the background.  \n\nThe food:  Excellent!  Your steak is served as intended, well aged beef cooked to order on a hot plate...nothing else!  Fantastic.  The sides are of sharable portions so agree on one for every 2 or 3 people unless you plan on toting a box of leftovers around Vegas.  The mac and cheese is perfect as is the smooth and creamy lobster bisque.  The other members in my party had several cuts of meat and one had a chicken dish...my sincerest apologies for not having info on those.  Fact is, I wanted every square inch of space in my belly for the rib eye on my plate.  Like sooo many other reviews about this place, it was melt in your mouth good.  We also ordered a chocolate gnash desert that could only be made better by eating it off of your favorite super models body, otherwise it was absolute perfection.  \n\nService was superb.

Steak was fantastic, but if you don't order the crab cake, you have missed something special. Ask about the off menu 4 course dinner. Will be eating here every time I am in town!"

Not only is it close to home, but I've literally never had a bad experience here....on the contrary everytime time has been amazing! From service to food and start to finish!  It blows my mind that some other restaurants in this companies portfolio disappoint? Because this place just blows not everything other steakhouse, but every other restaurant out of the water"

They were right.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe damn Filet Mignon that I've had!  It was so tender - it was almost tender like fish (I always order rare).  It was perfectly paired with the Peppercorn Steak Sauce.  If they sold it in a bottle, I'd buy it.\nThe service was very friendly.\nThe environment was classy, laidback, and filled with jazz music.\nThe prices are far more reasonable than the prices on the main Las Vegas strip!  (The filet was around $40 something)\n\nWhat could have been better?\nThe Oyster Rockefeller had large juicy oysters, but was overall OK: too much cheese and spinach for my taste.  The chopped salad was nice but not outstanding.\n\nOther notes:\nI want to return and try the FREAKIN HUGE Australian Rock Lobster tails (they are on display).  It was the largest lobster tail that I've seen in person for sure.\n\nBTW: The people who referred me to this restaurant just called it \"the restaurant at the Golden Nugget.\"  \n\nSo definitely try the outstanding steak + peppercorn sauce and check out that lobster booty."

My wife's 8 ounce fillet cooked medium was also amazingly tender and juicy.\n\nYou must also have the Wild Mushroom side, and the creamed spinach and the asparagus is awesome...\n\nCalamari starter was great too.\n\nWine is a little pricey, as is the food, so be prepared for that..2 cheaper bottles of wine and food for 6 was $900 with tip but the food is great..\n\nLook forward to my next trip."

When I first visited Vegas in 2011 I tried this place and became hooked! Now it is at least a yearly visit for me.  I always find an excuse to travel across the country because of this restaurant. \n\nFrom the moment you walk in to the moment you leave you are treated to a wonderful dining experience. The ambiance is such that you can get dressed up and make it a formal dining night or make it a semi-casual evening filled with mouth-watering food.\n\nThe steaks are cooked well enough that sauce is not needed, but I love their peppercorn sauce so I always order it.  This time I ordered the creamed spinach as a side dish and it was all that you would think a creamy cheesy spinach dish should be. My husband ordered the 12 ounce filet and I ordered my usual prime ribeye. When the steaks came we didn't speak to each other until we devoured the steaks lol. \n\nOh the drinks there are also made to perfection! There is nothing bad I can write about this place other than I wish there was one in Miami. :-(\n\nUntil then, I make a point to visit at least once a year."

Restaurant was extremely dark with no rest room. You had to leave and go through an extremely smoky casino. Not a big deal for a quick meal - but not a good setting for a business dinner where you're doing a lot of talking.\n\nFood was good / very good. I wasn't thrilled with the recommendation from the waiter and it was just okay for the price. \n\nWorst part - they delayed us on the food order - and then brought out all our food at once! If this happens at Applebee's - no problem - this should not happen at a high end steakhouse. Even worse - the wait staff never took away my plates (salad) and it was saddled next to me for the duration of the meal. 1st class pricing with 3rd class service.\n\nAgain - I'm sure you can have a better experience here. I won't be back to enjoy it with you. Too many options in Las Vegas to sit in a dark restaurant with zero ambiance and so-so service and food at high end prices. I have no problem paying for high end food / service - I just have some higher expectations."

It could have been here.

We thought the vinaigrette was a little off - kind of tasted like creamy Italian or something. Not our favorite but I still wanted to give it 5 stars because I think that small shortcoming was trumped by a really impressive overall experience. We also had a couple of amazing Moscow Mules and for our entree we had filets, which were perfect, and delicious along with a baked potato - which was huge and more than enough for two, and asparagus. The cherry on top came in the form of a traditional and HUGE piece of NY style cheesecake with strawberry sauce. It was so big we had to take half to go.

Why am I leaving our suite at Cosmopolitan, not to go downstairs to dine at STK, but to drive all the way to the business district of Vegas for...Vic & who?\n\n\nMy first impression was that this restaurant's decor was dated, sort of Sinatra old-school.  I scanned the room and was surprised it was full of people all seemingly in rapture with their meals.  Probably local Las Vegans whose desert-baked brains can't comprehend modern upscale dining.  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, no accoutrements.\n\nJuicy.  Tender.  So good I sat up from my slouch.  I was enveloped by a wisp of humility as that savory hunk of steak yelled out to me:  IN!...YO!...FACE!\n\nWhen my sweetie asked if my filet mignon was up to par with those from LA, I answered, \"It's not bad\".  \n\nDamn, I really got ripped-off at Cut."

Turned out to be way too much food...we all ended up waddling away with \"to go\" boxes...but it was well worth it. The sides are enormous, they are meant to be shared so keep that in mind when ordering. For the 7 of us I would say 3 sides would have been sufficient. We had  2 potatoes, 2 creamed corn, 2 broccoli, and 1 order of onion strings. My favorite was the creamed corn (which I would have never ordered on my own)...and the onions strings which went well with my perfectly cooked filet. I also enjoyed the rich lobster bisque...had just the right amount of yummy, chunks of lobster. Delicious! But the real star for my sweet tooth was the creme brulee...it was HUGE! It's served in a shallow, but wide bowl so you had a lot of hard shell to share :).

Tried the ribeye, splurged on the caviar and had the wedge salad. All were impeccable and delicious. Dinner was so good that I almost forgot that I was at a work function. Yum."

We arrived 10 minutes early and were greated warmly by the hostess.  They offered to seat us immediately or to let us enjoy a drink at the bar.  We chose to be seated immediately.\n\nOur waiter, Hector, arrived quickly with the menus.  Bread, butter and water arrived before we even opened the menus. The sommelier accomodated our request quickly and spent some time discussing a couple of our favorite Paso Robles wines.  \n\nGreat choice for dinner.  Had a great meal, great service, and a reason to dress up on Fremont Street.\n\nThank you for a great evening."

Don't get me wrong, it was a good, but not great meal.  The problem is that it's priced like it's Delmonico, Cut or Carnevino.  And, it ain't those places.  My wife had the special, which was crab stuffed lobster.  The lobster had a strong fishy odor, which indicated to us the lobster was not totally fresh.  Perhaps this was why it was used for the stuffed lobster rather than being steamed and served whole.  She had the filet, which was fine, but not overwhelming and certainly not worth the cost.  I had the ribeye, which again was fine.  Certainly better than your neighborhood Outback, but not worth anywhere near what they charged.  \n\nService was adequate.  The wine list was average I would say, probably decent for downtown.  If you plan on spending this much on a meal, I would recommend Prime, Brand, etc....."

Classy w/  \"Old Vegas\" ambiance and style. \nTo call this a \"Steakhouse\" is a disservice. This restaurant is flawless fine dining.\nFrom the food, to the service to the fine details everything here is perfection.\n\nMy wife and I dined here on our recent trip to Vegas and had the absolute best meal I've ever experienced in the more than 14 years that we've been coming to Vegas regularly. Every course was perfect.\nHonestly, we didn't even have reservations upon arrival at 6 pm and actually were somewhat under dressed upon entering but the hostess was kind and graciuosly seated us almost immediately.\n\nOur meal:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nSoup of the Day: Chicken Tortilla - Rich and smoky w/ fresh grilled corn, cotija cheese & fresh toasted tortilla strips.\nIt was the perfect balance of  layered spice, crunch and smoothness.\n\nSpinach Salad - Seriously the best sald I've EVER had! \nWarm, fresh leaf spinach w/ bacon, chopped eggs, kalamata olives & artichoke hearts served w/ a citrus honey vinaigrette. This could have served as the perfect light entree on it's own.\n\nEntrees:\n\nJumbo Fried Shrimp with Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes - My wifes entree. Classic ingredients done flawlessly. She loved it. Simple,  seasoned and cooked to perfection\n\nSea Bass A La Nage - My dish and our servers suggestion. \nChilean Sea Bass poached and topped w/ jumbo lump crab meat and paired with roasted baby vegetables. My favorite course of the night.\n\nDessert :\n\nCroissant Bread Pudding w/ Caramel Ice Cream - Another of our servers suggestion as a must try dish and It was everything he promised and more.\nLayers of Croissant stacked, combined and plated into a delicious bread pudding with cinnamon and caramel sauce and paired with a toffee brittle with freshly made caramel ice cream.  The actual plating itself resmbled a swan with a caramel ice cream body with a toffee brittle neck and head perched on a crunchy tuile and balanced with the bread pudding sliced into a triangle alongside. \n\nOverall, a wonderful meal and one we plan on repeating again soon the very next time we're in town. I especially can't wait to enjoy the Spinach Salad, Sea Bass & Bread Pudding time and again."

We went with their silver menu and I cannot express how delicious everything was.  I was so full from the jumbo crabcakes and shrimp cocktail appetizers that I could barely eat my perfectly cooked filet mignon or the au gratin potatoes.  Also, the slice of cheesecake they put in front of me I thought was to share with my fianc\u00e9, but then they put another slice in front of him.  I mean they were absolutely huge and the seasonal sorbet was delicious as well, ours was strawberry.  I know that everyone at the dinner fully enjoyed all the food since we took all the leftovers back to the hotel and every piece of leftover was eaten by the time we left the following Monday.  The servers were great as well with drinks, as soon as you started getting low, they would be asking you if you wanted a refill.  This was the perfect place for a smaller, intimate group dinner and hanging around Old Town the night before was amazing.  I will highly recommend Vic & Anthony's to everyone having their special day in Las Vegas."

Also, Nick has a tradition of wanting to eat at a steak house at least once while we are in Vegas and this was our only chance on the short trip we took there recently.\n\nWith that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the meal and I'd easily go back again. I ordered a classic filet and Nick ordered a strip and both were cooked perfectly. We also shared some of the mac and cheese (sooooo good), the Brussel sprouts (eh, average), and a chop salad that I really enjoyed. And while I know it's not part of the menu, the bread and butter were worth mentioning as well. I'm normally not much of a bread person, as I prefer my carbs in the form of purer sugar, but man alive! I couldn't stop eating this stuff.\n\nWhile it isn't the high roller steak houses you can find on the strip I think the quality is definitely great here and you also miss out on the waits and attitudes you might find in some places on the strip. Plus the cost, while high, wasn't as high as some of the other steak houses I've been in Vegas. More money for doubling down is always a good thing!"

We got dressed up and did the whole 9 yard. So for our anniversary  we travel to Vegas . We figured hey it's a little pricey but what the heck. Let's go for it and splurge.  We both got dressed nice. Her in a fine black cocktail dress. Myself in a sport blazer,pants and a headdress. Recently I have be wearing my hair long so it keeps it nice and neat, tied back and out of my face. We were staying at Bellagio and wore something very similar to Picasso for dinner the night before. Not a single problem there.  And was treated with the utmost respect and services.  Not at Vic and Anthony steakhouse Vegas. Don't worry we will get to the food very shortly. The hostess sat us down and asked me to remove my hat in the dining room.  I told her it's not a hat it's a headdress.  She walked away.  Than the waiter came to take our order and asked, \"Would the gentleman kindly remove your hat?\" I told him it was not a hat and this gentleman would like not to be asked again.  Than the manager came and as me to remove it. I told him that this headdress is culturally accept around the world and is also used by many religious group and can be very offensive if asked to be removed.  He looked at me like I drew the race card on him. I noticed how the whole senerio was making the evening unpleasant for my wife so I reluctant removed it. Than we noticed a older man in jeans and a cowboy had behinds us. To the right of us a group of people in shorts and t shirts.  You know the ones with the US flag on it. The food was  2nd rate. But the service was awful.  Never have I been made to feel so uncomfortable in a restaurant before. As we sat there I noticed one more thing. The only minority present was me."

My girl ordered the steak-lobster special and I ordered a 8 oz fillet, we both ordered them medium rare.  \nWhen the steaks came I was instructed to cut into the center and check it, if you dont like it we can fix it.  I'm like what?, but I'll get to this in a minute.  So the steaks come, hot as hell, I'm guessing they didn't even let it stand, anyway we cut into them as instructed and the suckers were cold and raw in the center.  It was even too rare for my girl which She will basically eat hers usually very rare.   The waiter instructs we we can just heat that up more.  Ok here's what I find wrong.   Medium rare should be warm in the middle, even by just pressing on the steaks I could tell it was rare.  Shouldn't a steak house charging these types of prices know better.  Once you cut the thing in half then put it back on the grill its going to dry out.  Away, so they give it a good again, steaks come back, plates hot as hell, but the damn thing is cold in the middle, huh?   The servicer quickly says , I have them make another one and hes gone.   So what comes out is this tiny fillet thats about 3/4\" thick, dry and over cooked.\n\n    At this point, I realize this is not going well, I just shut my mouth and eat.  I'm  not all that hungry, since I was snacking on her lobster, which was good.  The pesto and basil mash potatos were very good.   So in the end, I left not filling my desire for steak from a steak house, bummer.  I can't knock the service, I found the service to be excellent, but in the end the steak was the disappointing."

I had the 8oz fillet Mignon and appetizer of raw oysters & a side of broccoli. \nMy only complaint is that the waiter was not friendly, nor unfriendly, he also did not warn us about the size of the side dishes. Our group of 6 ordered 5 and were overwhelmed. We expected better of the waiter. Otherwise it would of been a 5 star. Though, other tables seemed to have had better staff serving them. We will try them again on our next trip to Vegas"

We've been dining out in Vegas for over 20 years and this is a first. Upon being seated I am asked to remove my hat as they have a no-hat policy. I think to myself, must be fancy, as I remove my hat and begin to enjoy a great dinner. Food and service was very nice. As I am enjoying this succulent filet mignon, I notice that most other guests in this place are dressed for an outing to Wal-Mart.\nShorts, dirty tee shirts from 80's rock concerts, etc.. I ask the waiter why they are offended by people wearing hats. His answer was very polite as one would expect. Hate to ramble here, just make sure you don't wear a hat around these folks and you'll have a great time."

I definitely have more of an Asian Fusion Tongue of sorts. But I did love my Bone-In Ribeye from Ruths Chris long ago. I had a great steak at what once was 3950 at Mandalay Bay. And I loved N9ne at Palms.\n\nBut this experience at Vic & Anthony's was Amazing! Maybe I wasn't expecting much as we were in Downtown Las Vegas, where the entire area just reeks of something so different from the likes of Mandalay Bay, Caesar's Forum Shops or even Restaurant Row down Flamingo. But it's not very difficult to recognize great service, a tasty steak, and some decent ambiance!\n\nLike I've mentioned, I had the 24 oz Bone-In Ribeye that just may be the best steak I've ever had! Aged to perfection, and cooked EXACTLY the way I wanted, soft and juicy on the inside, some great seasoning along the outside, especially around the bone. This steak was so good I have been craving another every day since I left there! Also in our party - a Ginormous Lobster, the Sea Bass and a no-bone Ribeye. Everyone was completely satisfied with their entrees as we didn't even get to the asparagus and other sides!\n\nOur server was extremely attentive and friendly as she also recommended a great red wine to go with our meal and threw in a couple of desserts for us to share for our birthdays (3 July Birthdays and 1 August Birthday), I thought she went completely out of her way to do that for us, but it totally completed a Great Evening there. The Creme Brulee and Chocolate Cake really did finish off our meal to Perfection!\n\nCan't recommend it enough! Another Wonderful Dining Experience with Great friends, Great Food, Great Service!"

That's not such a great idea if you're on a budget (like we were), but you'll quickly find out it's worth it, even if you are.  We were in a secluded room above the main dining area and had one server who was fantastic.  He had a lot of help, so the food was always hot and timely, but it was a feat nonetheless.  He was happy, knowledgeable, and on top of things.  He was also knowledgeable about Vegas and stuff to do, so he helped us with some useful ideas for what to do on Fremont St after dinner. \n\nThe food was the reason to come, though.  I ordered the Chicken Claire or Jaime (can't remember and it's not on the menu online), which was Chicken Scaloppine. Totally mind-blowing.  Best chicken I've ever had.  The guys sitting next to me with their filet and lobster were a little disappointed they didn't have what I was having.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough, after I shared it with half of the table.  The others said their dinner was really special, too.  \n\nWe also had most of the sides (duck fat potatoes were the hit) and desserts (pass on the creme brulee and get the bread pudding), but the main courses were exceptional.  I'm sure there are a lot of amazing restaurants in Vegas, but this one was worth the price if you're looking for a quality steakhouse with great service."

The steaks melt in your mouth, you don't even need to cut them with a knife, they are cooked to perfection. Writing this review 4 days later is making my stomach rumble and mouth water. This is fine dining, and yes it is very pricey but reasonable for what you get. The waiter warned us that the sides are meant to be shared, we ordered broccoli and wild mushrooms...... they were fabulously cooked, and seasoned perfectly. I would not change a thing. Yes, the steak is a piece of meat that comes on the plate, by itself. It does not need to be garnished, it is perfect by itself, it is rich and flavorful. All these low ratings for it being expensive.. HELLO it's a steak house, mind you a FINE DINING steak house, go to outback plebeian if you want to complain about the cost of your steak vs quantity/quality.  Also the low ratings about garnishing, again HELLO steak house,  you're getting a steak or meat... it's not coming with anything unless you ask for it. Also if clearly states on the menu upgrades for  sauces on your steak will cost you, so people complaining about hidden fees/cost, learn to read. Honestly, I'm 28 years old and I understand how to read a menu and how to punch in numbers on my cellphone and decide whether I can afford to eat some where. \n\nIf you're looking for a seriously nice dinner that you'll remember, come here.

It gave me a good view down the steps of the people walking by the restaurant.  That area of the upstairs is somewhat narrow and I had my back to the room so I couldn't see more of it.\n\nVery quickly, I was brought water and my order for iced tea was taken.  My server, Victor, came by and told me about the specials for the evening with prices--a nice touch that some restaurants don't do.  You have to ask them about the pricing.  I ordered lobster bisque for a starter, their 12 ounce filet, an order of sea salt fries (I was advised that this was small and manageable for one person, and then chocolate mousse for dessert.\n\nI was brought warm bread and a plate with piper butter.  Nice presentation.  The lobster bisque  was finished with cognac and it had a fair amount of the cognac flavor in it.  \n\nI ordered my steak blue--Victor asked if I wanted it seared 1/3 inch on all sides and I said yes.  The steak was about 2 inches thick and the searing was just perfect for not cooking it too much.  The interior was very rare, exactly the way I like my steak.  The fries were good with a large amount of salt on them.  If you're watching your sodium intake, get something else.\n\nWhen it came time for dessert, I asked for suggestions.  Victor recommended either the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e or the chocolate mousse cake.  For the most part, I find cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to be almost the same from one place to another so I opted for the chocolate mousse cake.  That was the correct choice.  It was creamy, chocolaty, and simply a great way to end the meal.\n\nService throughout was great!  My iced tea was replaced several times with no need to ask.  The only detriment was the group of five very loud men at the next table.  Because of the narrowness of the restaurant here, I heard the whole conversation including talk of Leonardo DiCaprio and other personalities from an insurance guy.  Go figure.  All this while using four letter words quite liberally.  This was something the restaurant can't control, but it was a drawback from the overall enjoyment of the meal.\n\nFinally, you're paying close to Strip prices for a downtown steakhouse.  It is worth it because the filet was very, very good."

That being said, if you are looking for a great steak and are willing to part with a few Andrew Jackson's (or more), then Vic and Anthony's is worth a visit. All of the steaks come ala carte and the side dishes will set you back a few bucks as well. \n\nI opted for the 8 oz. Filet Mignon and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and the potatoes were outstanding. Although the side dishes are a little pricey, the portion size is generous enough to share. I would rate the steak and mashed potatoes as some of the best I've ever had.\n\nThey also offer chicken, fish and lobster, but all in our party opted for beef. I will say the Australian Lobster tails on display looked rather tasty though. If you are a salad aficionado, they have you covered there too with eight to choose from on the menu. They have a fairly extensive beverage list, including specialty drinks, wine and bottled beers. \n\nThe service was impeccable and the atmosphere was what you would expect from a high class steak house. Located inside the Golden Nugget Casino, the clientele ranged from those in tuxedos and dresses, to others in blue jeans and T-shirts. Typical Vegas tourism in an upscale environment.\n\nMy 8 oz. Filet was $41 and the side dishes ranged from $9 - $12. The three of us split two sides, or Accompaniments, as the menu refers to them. We ordered a Crab Cake appetizer (not listed on the menu) at the recommendation of the waiter. It was outstanding, despite the $21 price tag for one four ounce Crab Cake.  For dessert, I went with the Chocolate Mousse. One in the party got the cheesecake, which rivaled any I'd seen before. All total, for the three of us, including a few adult beverages and the tip, we left happy and satisfied, even after dropping just north of $300.\n\nIf you are looking for a great meal, in a great atmosphere with outstanding service, and don't mind dropping a few bucks, I would recommend Vic & Anthony's. Their menu is also available on the Golden Nugget website, so you can peruse it before you go."

A party of five.  We arrived fifteen minutes late from our reservation.  We had to wait for a couple minutes and were seated shortly after.  I love the mahogany decor and the dimmed lighting - very romantic.  \n\nOur server, Victor, was very nice.  I was skeptical of his nicety at first - thinking he is going to try to sell me the most expensive item on the menu.  As it turns out, he kind of knew what he was talking about.  He recommended a promotional red wine, which our party loved.  The boyfriend ordered a bombay sapphire, and he liked it.  (He then finished up the bottle of red wine also.)  \n\nFor appetizer, we had the steak tartar, the infamous crab cake, and a dozen of the fresh oysters.  All were delicious except for the crab cake.  Not that the crab cake had anything wrong with it, but it was \"a crab cake with an edge\" to quote the boyfriend.  It was chunky crab meats, which is always a plus, but it didn't have as much flavor to it as I would have liked.  So go ahead, give it a shot if crab cakes are your thing.  It was by no mean terrible.  The steak tartar was very fresh - no one got sick afterward.  The oysters - almost comparable to those served in Santa Monica, CA. \n\nOur group shared a caesar salad and the spinach salad (recommended by Victor), and they were also delicious.  The spinach salad triumphs the caesar, however, in my humble opinion.  The spinach salad is tossed with this honey vinaigrette, that is to die for, really.  It is a very flavor dressing but not one that weighs down your palette.  It leaves a fresh, light, summery feel to your mouth after each bite.  We also tried the lobster bisque, and it was also very good.  However, Joe's Stonecrab at the Forum Shop might have a slightly better one - just slightly... \n\nOnto the entrees!!!  We had the bone-in ribeye - medium rare, prime ribeye - medium, organic lamb chop - medium rare, and the shrimp scampi.  The bone-in ribeye was to die for!  I mean, the meat literally melted in my mouth!!  The perfect texture and temperature - I couldn't believe that I had found a better place for ribeye (Flemin's and Joe's was previously my favorite.)  The prime ribeye was good, but maybe because it was cooked to the temperature of medium, it made the texture a bit tougher than I'd like, but still very good.  As for the lamb chops - I don't personally like lamb chops, but I had a bite, and to my little knowledge with lamb chop, it was passable.  The boyfriend had the lamb chops, and he killed it - finishing it by picking up the rib and torn what was left off on the bone.  Lastly, the shrimp scampi was good, but I think by the time we tried the shrimp, we were so full.  What was interesting with this shrimp scampi was the sauce - it was of a spicy tomato sauce, which was very good with the fresh ciabatta bread they serve throughout our meal.  \n\nWe also had the wild mushrooms and mac and cheese as sides.  No one, except the boyfriend, liked the wild mushrooms.  Mac and cheese was okay...  Nothing special. \n\nWe didn't have dessert since we had cake at home, but they do have the largest scotch menu I have ever seen.  \n\nLast but not least, I promise to wrap this up, the service there is great!!!  I mean, I am a true believer of good, friendly customer service.  If they serve good food, but terrible service, I wouldn't see the point to come back.  Our glasses were always filled, and Victor was so honest about what was good (or maybe the menu just didn't have anything bad...)  Anyways, the service is what made me give this place the fifth star. \n\nI hope I have convinced those who want to come to Vic & Anthony's but are skeptical of going downtown to the Golden Nugget thinking how could downtown has good steaks to offer.  I was skeptical once, but now I am a true believer.  I would definitely come back to Vic & Anthony's.  \n\nEnjoy!!!"

They are serving high end food, at big ticket prices, while food and service are top notch, it just takes away from the ambience to have patrons yelling at the NHL game during a meal, IMO. YMMV. \n\nOur waiter started us off with cocktails and suggested the Shrimp & Crab Martini appetizer, it sounded chaotic: jumbo shrimp, crab claws and lump crab meat with kimchi\nslaw, plaintain chips to \"dip\" out of eponymous glass...but boy did we love it! Very unique, and a great kickoff to set the tone for the meal. \n\nForgoing wine for a second round, he had the filet mignon special served with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus, savoring every bite. My twin lobster tails were perfectly executed, we shared a side of spinach which was simple and delicious. Before dinner, we (I!) decided to order the Artisan Cheese Board in lieu of dessert: it was magnificent, we battled over the accoutrements as much as the five excellent cheeses which were chosen by the Chef. \n\nThis was a superb meal, with 5* service throughout, Vic & Anthony's remains a favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, but for a quiet, romantic evening, not my first choice. \n\n* great for group celebrations *\n\n** still have fantastic gynormous whole lobsters & the biggest tails (3# is not unusual ) I've seen in Las Vegas  **\n\n*** my pics do not do the food justice, but I abhor flash photography in fine dining settings ***"

I usually use Yelp to find ethnic and other interesting restaurants but this time I used it to find a good steak house and I was pleased to see the reviews were accurate.\n\nWe were a little worried about leaving our beautiful hotel on the strip to go to the Golden Nugget for dinner but after reading the Yelp reviews we had to take a chance.  I told my wife not to worry because we weren't going to be hanging out in the Golden Nugget just eating at the restaurant inside. First, I was surprised that the Golden Nugget had been remodeled to pretty high standards. Second, Vic and Anthony's makes a very nice initial impression and it frankly it doesn't really matter what casino it's located in because you'll only see it coming and going."

Sorry.\n\nMaybe it was the high expectations from the raving reviews, maybe people who reviewed have been to the Outback too many times, I don't know, but Vic & Anthony's, while good, didn't stand out at all.\n\nLike a good steakhouse, they're going to give you a black napkin if you have black pants on. They're going to put it on your lap for you. They're going to expect you to use your forks and knives in the right order and take them away as the courses progress. The steaks are going to be about $30-$50 bucks. You're going to order sides to share. Your steak is going to be served on a hot plate and they're going to tell you to cut it in half to make sure it's served correctly. It's going to taste well seasoned and melt in your mouth.\n\nThis.... I can get anywhere. So is there anything else that makes me want to come here rather than any other steak house? No.\n\nThe only note of originality here is that the wedge salad is huge (too big, really). The Prime Ribeye is also A LOT OF MEAT. \n\nThe Au Gratin potatoes are covered in a Velveeta-like cheese that sticks to your mouth and sits like a rock in your stomach. Not in a good way.\n\nThey have a good wine list and I recommend the Cab/Syrah wine by the glass if you're leaning in that direction.\n\nStill giving it four stars because there's nothing to really complain about... the food was good, the service was boring but standard... there's just nothing to rave about. For $150 bucks we were pretty well fed, but I'd rather have spent it somewhere else."

This was our first time here and I do have a few complaints as well as praises.\n\n1) At first, when we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we couldn't valet unless we were staying at the hotel, and that the garage sign said it was full. We drove around for about 10 minutes before asking again about the garage, and were then let in after telling the guy at the gate that we had reservations. When we got into the garage, it wasn't even close to full.\n\n2) We called ahead and made reservations and then had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated. There were people that just walked up before us, with no reservations and still got in before us. What's the point of making reservations?\n\n3) The saving factor was that once we were in, the customer service was good and the food was excellent. \n\nMy wife and I had a whole lobster, which ran about $90 by itself. We had the crab cakes for the appetizer, which we shared with our friends. They ordered oysters that they shared with us.\n\nFor the main course, we both had blackened ribeye and a baked potato. We had other food that we tried as well, but when it was all said and done, we spent about $385 with tip. Our friends spent $140+ tip.\n\nIt was definitely worth it if you're looking for somewhere very nice to eat. We sat and talked for about 45 minutes after we finished the meal and they continued to serve us water and iced tea (what I had). Not once were we rushed.\n\nIf I didn't have the parking and reservation complaints above, they would have gotten 5 stars from me."

We were seated, it is a nice place like any other nice steak houses in Vegas. When the waiter, Jay, came over to take our order, I felt he was very rude!! He acted very impatient with us, as if we couldn't order fast enough. When I would try to ask him a question, I felt he ignored me! He pretended he could not hear me. This happened quite a few times. They also didn't leave he right number of water glasses on the table so when we let him know, he made my mom feel as if she was bothering him!! It was terrible!!! \n\nThen dinner came out... And the steak was actually pretty good!! They were cooked just the way we ordered, which I have found a rarity in the steakhouses around Vegas! The salt they sprinkled on top really made the difference!! The creamed corn was delicious! Kids loved it! Mashed potatoes were not good, over whipped and you could taste it was really gummy. My mom ordered the plain 3 oz lobster... But our waiter Jay brought out the stuffed lobster. Well my mom thought it was what she ordered and we didn't know until we reviewed the bill later in the night... But Instead of her $30 lobster she ordered, He wrote down the wrong thing (feeling as if it was an intentional mistake) and charged her $80!!! So watch out!! Clarify your order because they can be sneaky!!!! \n\nAnd RIGHT after dinner came the bill!!!! Not once did Jay ask if we wanted coffee or dessert!!!! We had two tables side by side to fit us all, well the other table got coffee, he didn't even ask our side!!!! Who does that????? Very rude!! \n\nI truly feel our waiter Jay did not want to \"deal\" with any of the women at the table, he just wanted to talk to the men!!  He was the one who brought the credit card back to the table for us to sign... He handed it to my dad (it was my card), so I told him \"I'LL TAKE IT!\" Loud enough to make sure he heard me!!! He then handed it to me and said \"this card?\" I said \"ITS MINE!\" And once he knew I was paying, he was all smiles and thank yous! \"Thanks for coming have a great evening blah blah blah!\" Unfortunately the tip was included since we had such a large party. He was lucky it was!  Not sure if I would go back there because of JAY! For $400+ I expect MUCH better, more respectful service!!!!!! \n\nThe gentleman who bussed our table, Richard or Ricardo (I can't remember his name!) he was amazing!!!!!!! I wish he was our waiter!!! So attentive, very polite! He acknowledged my kids!!! Made sure no hot plates were in front of them!! Where as Mr Jay put a giant steak knife right in front of my son! Hello!!!! Moron!  \n\nHope the steakhouse smartens up and hires more appropriate staff!"

But what a delightful surprise this restaurant was.\n\nMother in law was in town a few weeks ago, and we were running late to the Gordie Brown show.  Originally we were going to try the steakhouse at the El Cortez, because I had a restaurant.com certificate, but we took so long showing her the strip we just didn't have time to go there before the show.  So we came here instead, because we could have a quick meal in the same casino.\n\nWe were seated right away, without reservations.  My mother in law and my husband had the fillet, and I had the ribeye.  They had a really nice surf and turf going on that night and I should have ordered that, but for some reason the ribeye was calling me, even though I mostly order fillet.  I guess I didn't want to copy everyone at the table.  We also ordered lobster bisque, caesar salad, and the potatoes gratin, spinach, and asparagus.\n\nI have never seen my mother in law get excited about anything we have eaten, in Las Vegas or anywhere else.  Mostly when we go out to eat, she constantly complains about the expensive price of restaurants outside of Montana, and acts like she is mad we went out instead of cooking.  She did have a fit at first about eating here looking at the prices, but after tasting her food she loudly exclaimed \"oh my god, this is so good,\" and shut up about how much it costs.  But this is a woman who grew up on a farm mostly in poverty and worked for the government her entire career, raising my wonderful husband alone, so I cannot be mad at her attitude about it.  I try to take her occasionally to nice places because, well, she deserves it.\n\nEvery steakhouse in town I have eaten at always has something not executed correctly, or the quality of food isn't that great.  This literally was the most perfect steakhouse meal I have had.  The meat was so flavorful that my husband still dreams about it, and was executed with the right amount of char that we love at the perfect temperature.  Sides were so perfect and good they could not have been better.  Lobster bisque had lots of nice chunks of lobster in it.\n\nI'm not sure why Carnevino and Cut and some of the other steakhouses are considered the best in town, but this really blew everything I have eaten away, including CraftSteak which was garbage compared to this meal.  Maybe I will try Carnevino and Cut next just to compare!"

But on a price/location/quality nexus, this place is in the top 10 in town. (Going back next week)"

Very traditional surroundings. My brother and a friend of mine loved their steaks and thought the filet mignon was one of the best they had had and cooked perfectly to their taste. The sides were good and the waiter was helpful and friendly. The only small negatives were that the restrooms were a trek through the casino which wasn't ideal and the red wine was rather too chilled. The air con was also a little fierce. We were too full for a pudding put the neighbouring table ordered what looked and they confirmed was a rather spectacular cheesecake. A lovely evening and would recommend if you are a steak lover."

After seeing the 4.5 star average on Yelp I was expecting greatness, however the food and service were mediocre/poor. I hate to give negative reviews, but this place deserved it in my mind. I hope my Yelp friends who gave this place 4 or 5 stars would crusify me.\n\nMy mother had the Tuna Tartar with avocado, citrus vinaigrette & chips. We both liked it, but it didn't blow us away. I ordered the Prime Ribeye with the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. My ribeye came out and we were told the side dishes were coming in \"ten seconds\".  A few minutes later our waitress came by to see how everything was and I informed her that I still haven't started to eat my steak since I am waiting for my sides. She assured me they will be out shortly. Seven minutes after my steak they finally came! Bullshit! I expect my sides to come out at the same time as my steak so I can enjoy them together. I think that is pretty standard and not an outlandish request. When they were brought to our table there was no apology for the delay. Unlike other steakhouses I have been to Vic & Anthony's didn't serve the first scoop of the side dish onto your plate. I know that makes me sound like some regal, high expectation asshole, but I'm sorry, that's one of the many things that makes the best steakhouses stand out (Mastro's for example). I wasn't crazy about the creamed spinach and the au gratin potatos were waaaaaaay to cheesy for my liking. The steak was not what I was hoping for.\n\nLastly, our waitress was inattentive, unfriendly, unapologetic, and I don't think smiled once throughout our meal. Maybe it was an off night, but when you are paying big bucks for a nice steak dinner there should be no off nights. I'll be back in downtown Las Vegas in two weeks and I will be sure to avoid Vic & Anthony's."

We walked in without reservations.  Luckily they do offer a full menu at the bar.  The three bartenders who helped us out were readily available with professional helpfulness.  \n\nNoah suggested the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake was not to be missed.  I concur that it was indeed a treasure on the appetizer list.  It's definitely jumbo with so much crab packed in.  The flavor of the sauce enhanced the full flavor of this lovely cake.  \n\nI am always thrilled when my friends want to spilt entrees so we can try more than one item.  This evening it was split between Roasted Salmon and Filet Mignon.  The steak was medium and perfectly pink.  It was so tender that it felt like slicing through butter.  The steak was delicious that it didn't need any sauce or extra seasonings.  \n\nThe roasted salmon was good being served over asparagus and potato pur\u00e9e.  The roasted salmon was supposed to be stuffed with Gouda and Jumbo Lump Crab but I didn't taste much of that if any.  I still enjoyed the dish very much but has room for improvement.  \n\nThe broccoli we ordered on the side was really eye opening! It was as if two huge heads of broccoli were steamed and put on the plate.  Yes this side will feed a village! \n\nIt was a pleasure to dine here and I look forward to my next visit!"

So we roll downtown into old Las Vegas where we normally dine next door at Hugo's Cellar but thought we would give this place a try. \n\nArrive to bustling place heart in the Golden Nugget where our party of 8 is seated immediately at a nice round table.  Service is brisk where OK bread is provided as we peruse a fairly overpriced wine list and a similar menu as its NJ counterpart.   Everything is Ala Carte and pricey as a top steakhouse is but if they deliver you don't mind \n\nAfter selecting some wine we are off to the races. \n\nWedge Salads with Blue Cheese \"Homemade\" dressing is truly outstanding with a rich Roquefort cheese chunked in.  \n\nThe Shrimp Cocktail were large fresh and cold but the cocktail sauce in short was extremely disappointing. \n\nCesar salads were OK nothing special. \n\nEntrees: \n\nVeal Chops Absolute perfection, grilled and charred to proper temperature and as tasty as they come. \n\nThe Rib Eye's were in short OK but not as good as the Veal Chops. \n\nI'm not a filet Mignon person and this large piece of prime beef did nothing to change my mind as it simply has no flavor. This is a personal preference. \n\nThe NY Strip was top notch. \n\nSides were good but not great as baked potato was a disappointment while the mushrooms were excellent as was the creamed corn. \n\nService was 100% outstanding all night. \n\nAll and all a bit pricey, gratuity of 20% already added on so no problem there, but I've had better steakhouse experiences for the price points, and I certainly think they A.C.

The atmosphere is extremely classy and although our waiter was super knowledgable and nice, the hostess was not. She didn't smile, and seemed like she didn't want to be there. Also, even though we had reservations, it still took about 20 minutes to get seated and it seemed we got seated at an awkward table right at the entrance. \n\nThe steak here was delicious but I do wish they had a smaller sized cut that was not a filet mignon (i like a lot of marbling, something the filet mignon cut does not have). Definitely cooked to the right temperature. Everything you can ask for in a top tier steakhouse. In comparison to Mastro's and Ruth's Chris, I would say the taste is slightly less than par. Don't get me wrong, still delicious but nothing out of this world. With all the steakhouses in Vegas, it wasn't so good that I'll return here again. \n\nTry their crab cake! (Singular, because theres only one). Super chunky crab meat, great flavor and great sauce. If you want to make your visit extra special and different from other steakhouse visits, you must try their crab cake! \n\nI believe our total for 2 was about $150 and we got the crab cake and a side of creamed corn."

Decor is dark, mahogany, jazz music and white table cloths. Great atmosphere, you forget you are right in the center of Fremont Street. The service was excellent, with an extensive wine and cocktail list. I had the pear cocktail which was sweet, but a perfect start to the night. My friends had old fashioneds and sazeracs...lots of bourbons and ryes to choose from...\n\nWe started with a round of appetizers--the tartare and cheese plate. Both were excellent, but I have to call out the cheese/meat plate as outstanding. The truffle salami was superb and the three cheeses they selected were liked across all guests at the table. Next we ordered salads--all of which were VERY generously sized. I had the roasted beet salad and highly recommend! The beets were fresh and the goat cheese dressing was the perfect balance to the sweetness in the beets. For dinner I had the filet--cooked perfectly--and everyone at the table was pleased with their steaks. We tried several of the sides...MUST try is the au gratin potatoes (as long as you like A LOT of cheese) and the mac and cheese. Mashed potatoes were good, but didn't compare to some of the other options.\n\nA few of us tried desserts...again...awesome. I had the croissant bread pudding (which was a HUGE serving...definitely share with several) and my friends had the strawberry ice cream. \n\nAll in all...great evening and overall dining experience. One of the few places that actually lives up to \"strip prices\"...Between the ten of us, we've tried several of the downtown steakhouses and this was one of our favorites!

Our waiter was fantastic. Nice moustache. Great care for the patrons. He came back out with the maitre'd and a totally clean unseasoned and perfectly medium rare masterpiece of a NY. Probably pushing 3lb to be honest. I ordered more wine for the table and made sure the waiter was taken care of. Here is my guidance to the establishment: Almost everything was over seasoned that night. I don't know if that's typical. The vegetables, particularly the beet salad, were perfect. If you could arrange to have a restroom that was in your own space and not in the casino that would be helpful. I would eat there again in a heartbeat even though I had to send my steak back the first time around."

Stakes were amazing too. and the best thing was their potatoes with cheese on top. I tried to cook the same thing home after we came back from Vegas.\nThe thing I dont like about the place is that they display raw pieces of meat and half dead lobsters  - I felt so sad about those poor creatures who were killed for our pleasure. (but C'est la vie.)\nAlso they dont have a bathroom in the restaurant   and just to wash your hands you need to travel all the way  through casino."

Walking into this place on a thursday evening is a fairly easy. But its very very busy in there.\n\nI am a little dissapointed that we dont get to seat in the side seats somewhere instead of being seated in the middle of the dining room. But let me tell you that the experience is that great. I cant never drink my water glass till its empty.\n\nIts always full somehow. I think they have ten servers assistant who just walk around filling up water. Their server assistant are wearing chef uniform to make the whole place looks very classy and elegant. \n\nThey even take the time to bring black napkin to my fiance's black dress so that it match her outfit. All I can say is, this place rocks.\n\nAlright, lets get on to the food. We try the lobster bisque for $9.95 absolutely worth it. Have lots of lobster in it and taste very seafoody. \n\nNext, the appetisers, we try the maple glazed quail thats to die for. The maple glazed on the quail is so damn good, we wouldve swallow the quail bone if its not because the head saying dont swallow it.\n\nWe ordered a couple of fillet mignon and prime rib eye thats to die for with peppercorn sauce. Keep in mind that everything is not free. \n\nPeppercorn sauce additional $2.95 and sides like mashed potatoes are $6.95. I dont mind paying but some yelper might find it helpful that I write down some prices.\n\nThe fillet mignon cost $38 something and its absolutely worth it. My rib eye cost $45 and its HUGE!!! I cant finish it and lemme tell you something, I can eat some steak!!! \n\nAll in all, its a great experience and we definetely put it up there as one of the best steak we ever ate and our server BEN is really great and on the ball as well as fully knowledge in his craft!!"

The Golden Nugget had a ad in the room that you can take the restaurant where you get an appetizer (I got the Wedge Salad), main course (8oz  filet mignon and mash potatoes for me) and a desert (Went with the chocolate cake) for less than $50, a great deal. It was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten, no joke. \n\nThe side that you get is more than enough for two people, so my wife and I ordered two different sides, she got the creamed spinach, both were excellent. The service of course is top notch. I didn't eat much of the desert, not only because I was really full from the meal, but the chocolate cake was really too rich for me. However, I loved the steak so much, I could have cared less about the cake!\n\nIt is pricey of course, but if you're staying on Fremont and want to go all out for one a great meal, this is a good spot to do it!"

For me, it was the concierge at our hotel.\n\nI was trying to put together a dinner-show package for clients. Trade shows in Vegas usually come up for me around the first quarter of the year. And when entertaining clients, I've got a short list of reliable spots in Vegas for dinner. And it's not just about the food; it's definitely about an enjoyable evening, which has to include a relaxing, and tasteful ambiance. V&A's is all that, and reasonable.\n\nIn the past, I would have made reservations at Joe's Prime Steak & Stone Crab at the South end of Caesar's Forum Shoppes. But now, I have a very good alternative. And about those \"reasonable\" prices? Not as high as you might think. For our party of four, a couple cocktails and sodas, two appetizers, the NY strip, a bone-in Ribeye, a salmon entree, a chicken entree, three vegetable sides and a dessert we four split, our bill was about $250. That's very reasonable for a steakhouse meal. \n\nFunny thing. When we had been seated for a bit, a group of four young guys came in, sat down, opened the menus........ and then in concert, stood up and walked out. I'm thinking they thought they were in the hotel's cafe? \n\nThings that I really like about this hotel restaurant...... it's easy access, just inside the East side valet entrance to the hotel. The servers are formal, but very accomodating and non-intimidating. The atmosphere is really casual, and the food is very good. Even if I'm by myself, I'll consider getting my next Vegas meal here. And I don't like eating by myself, but for their steaks I'd break that rule."

Seriously did not disappoint & the food lived up to the hype. Quite possibly one of the top 2 most delicious filet mignons I've ever had in my life - and I have had my fair share, it's usually my go-to. \n\nReservations were for 4, and I decided to have their prix-fix which included lobster bisque, filet mignon, creamed spinach & creme brulee all for $50. The filet alone was worth $50 and everything else was delicious too... I actually gave my meat an applause & saluted the last piece before I ate it. If a vegetarian would have tried it, I'm sure they would have been happy that the animal turned into a fine mouthwatering morsel. Life changing it was.\n\nOther food at the table included an oyster platter, where the oysters were very big but our oyster expert friend was amazed at how good they were for being so big (I don't eat them.) A wedge salad that looked big & satisfying, a large cheese & meat plate that our friends mostly wrapped up to eat later. My dinner date had some chocolate cake souffle thing and I - who doesn't care a whole lot for chocolate - would really like to eat it again. \n\nIf you love wine - they have an amazing wine list as well. I only had a Malbec & a sparkling wine but I could have moved into their wine cellar. \n\nAmbiance was great, staff was pleasant & attentive, the only thing I could possibly think of that I didn't like was the restrooms were out in the casino. But I'll gladly walk 10 times for the food here, especially with great service at a decent price.\n\nEveryone in our group loved it & will definitely be going back!"

We were planning on watching a show over at The Smith Center and wanted to eat somewhere within close proximity. I would not be dissappointed in our choice. First we were greated very warmly and seated right away. I would recommend making a reservation and you could easily do that on their website. The atmosphere was very warm with all the dark wood features.\nOn to the service and dishes. The service was impeccable. My ice tea actually was filled with ice and I continued to get ice tea AND ice throughout the dinner! Perfect. Most of the time at other restaurants I get a glass with 5 cubes of ice that melt by the middle if the dinner and unless you ask for extra ice your not going to get it. It's the big things that count but all the little things count just as much. Also the wait staff was very friendly and welcoming.\nThe dishes we had were the best I had in awhile. We had the calamari in which the caramelized onions were delicious! I had the seared tuna which I cannot even begin to describe. The dish was just amazing. The tuna melted in my mouth. Unbelievable. If you love sushi you will love this dish. My wife had the shrimp scampi which she loved. My brother had the prime rib eye which he stated was cooked to perfection and my cousin had the pork chops that were cooked just right. I have to say that previously we ate at the steakhouse inside the sunset station and I would most definitely have paid a little more to eat at Vic and Anthony's.\nDon't pass up the opportunity to eat here. I would probably compare the quality of food to when my wife and I ate at BOA Steakhouse about 3 years ago. Happy Dining!"

Finally, while in town for meetings, I suggested it to a coworker and he agreed. So we met downtown and gave it a shot.  \n\nThe atmosphere is upscale and upbeat yet relaxing. Dark cherry wood, low lighting, open spaces but with an air of privacy. There is also a bar with eight seats and I noticed there were always a couple open. There were two servers/bartenders back there which is one for every four seats. Not bad.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to get in without reservations, but I highly recommend making them. It was a Tuesday night for us so not too crowded but I'd never try walking in like that during the weekend. Unless maybe you want to dine at the bar.\n\nI ordered the Prime Ribeye and added some Mac & Cheese. Both were absolute five star dishes. I can't say enough about them. Outstanding. One of the best steaks I've encountered on the earth thus far. The Mac & Cheese was amazing in it's own right, baked just right with the perfect combination of taste and texture. Not salty at all, like many restaurants make it. \n\nThe service was beyond courteous and professional. I'd give it six stars. Everyone there clearly wants you happy and wants you to come back. The staff combined with the pleasant atmosphere made us want to hang out a little longer than we usually would. So we did. \n\nOf course, when I go out something a little odd has to happen to me. Tonight was no different. A guy at a nearby table ordered a side of broccoli and these two HUGE broccoli florets come out on a plate. He's shocked (and a little hammered) and starts walking around other tables with his plate begging people to take a slice of his broccoli. When he got to us, we politely declined and he was a little indignant and said: \"What's wrong with you people, don't nobody like broccoli?\"\n\nFinding no takers, he sat back down at his table with the two trees still on his plate and went at it alone. \n\nDinner and a show. \n\nThis is a somewhat upscale place but I noticed a few patrons in shorts. I wouldn't recommend it because Vic's calls for better than that. I personally wouldn't wear them because, in this dark environment, I'm afraid my legs would glow in the dark and be the spectacle of the evening. Even more than that broccoli guy. No, I wore some dark jeans with some way cool dress shoes and a long-sleeved polo and fit in just fine. \n\nThis is a must visit if you're downtown and looking for the right place to dine. Don't wait years like I did to try Vic & Anthony's. It is a supreme steakhouse."

We sat at the bar as the 4 of us were very causal. Very comfortable bar stools, spacious, nice dark lighting, perfect old music...\n\nThe portions are huge so be careful of over ordering as we did. The broiled portabella was juicy and tasty. The caprese salad was very well prepared. The tower of chips and onion strings were ok (the chips were better, but a gigantic portion of onion strings)\n\nNext came the wedge salad. They cut it in half for my husband and I to split, and my plate alone was a huge dinner portion salad! Very crisp fresh iceberg lettuce and they served it on a chilled plate! Very smart touch.\n\nFinally, my husband and I split sides: Broccoli, creamed corn, grilled asparagus, and the baked potato no bacon. Again, huge sides. But all very good and very fresh. No microwave tasting potato or rubbery canned corn here.\n\nOH I forgot another fantastic part. The Pinot Noir from Oregon is fantastically smooth. The cheese platter is delicious. Its pricey though.... says market price on the menu so ask if you are interested. Ours came out to $27 I think, but they gave us a variety of 8 cheese (good portions of each), honeycomb, seasonal, sweet blueberries and blackberries, and dried sugared orange rinds. Perfect spread to construct many tasty little cheese breads.\n\nWill be back... great romantic spot for couples!"

This isn't a tucked away bargain on Freemont, its a destination restaurant. A great guy's place for that one \"big meal\".  It's not in a league or price range, with Crafsteak, but it could very well be the best steak you eat all year.\n\nYeah, the service was an issue. They were friendly but they delivered our entrees one at a time, while the rest of us were still working on our appetizers.  \n\nThe apps were fantastic-- here's what I say: They have the best crab cakes on the strip,  topped with a sweet and tangy chive sauce, bold but complimentary to the pure and rich crab. Sensational  The sirrachi quail was ordered as a lark--  I've always wanted to bbq with \"the rooster sauce\" but, now I actually \"get\" why they have the rooster on the bottle-- it works with bird amazingly well.  The quail was delicate, juicy and a bit gamey, but the sirrachi glaze was such a strong contrast that every bite was an experience. Excellence! \n\nThe freshwater oysters were also a hit, they were in fantastic condition, and with a little rock salt sprinkled over them and some seriously coarse pepper, delicious. We also tried the shrimp cocktail which came with about #4 shrimp, huge babies! The sauce was a compote of cherry tomato, chunky garlic pieces, that beautiful coarse black pepper and some sherry. There was a hint of the sarachi in this as well. This is one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever tried, and it was in my opinion, a value. If a couple were splitting this, it would work as a first course for sure.\n\nNow to the steak. I ordered a bone-in rib eye, others in my party also ordered the fillet, the stuffed sea bass (amazing) the stuffed salmon (creative and maybe the standout) the lamb rack (4 to a rack) and of course there's always one...he ordered the chicken. \n\nMy steak ordered Medium rare was cooked to perfection, lightly seasoned, every bite was juicy and had that tangy-tease on first bite, followed by the deep beef flavor. Magnificent!    And rib eye lovers take note, the meat near the bone was intense, a true sign of proper aging.  It was delicious and I left nothing but the bone.  I tried the stuffed salmon, which was filled with gouda and onion compote, and flakes of fresh herb, it was sensational-- I believe it was cooked on some sort of exotic wood because it had a unique flavor. This is the best salmon I have ever tasted. The cheese, the herbs, and the wood flavor only made the flesh of the perfectly cooked fish blow up, it was raining slamon flavor in my mouth, with dimensions I can't explain-- I want to go back and have this dish!  \n\nThe sides were of course above average. You don't get a Michelin star for slacking in detail, but I am tired of baby veg, and chunky mash potatoes. but they were very very good. The onion strings, and asparagus (cooked with truffle oil) were fantastic. Also, I really liked the wedge salad. It was huge of course, but the cheese and two types of bacon, house dressing really was impressive, I mean its as if this great sounding salad we've all ordered before came to new life. It's perfected here. \n\nParking: work with the people at the Nugget and you'll have less of a walk.  Service: Knowledgeable, and very friendly, good reccomendations without seeming like they are up-selling. Above average. Young table runners though seem a bit out of whack. Wine service is a true value here.\n\nHighly Recommended\n\nPer person with wine, drink, app, salad and entree about $95 with tax.\nPer glass wine service is generous and reasonable, and they are known for heavy pours.\n\nClean restrooms, and old school decor. Men should wear a \"going out shirt\" gals dress up here, but there's plenty of clientele going casual on the night I was there, so I can't say any dress code is firm. I'd call."

I've had a few steaks on the menu, all of which were incredible, but my personal favourite is the veal chop. It is so mouth wateringly delicious and getting sweat on my brow typing about it.

The Filet Mignon was some of the best steak i have had-yummy yummy yummy. The tuna was not that great and i barely ate any of it.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all. \n\nDecor is dark and almost feel like you walked into a SpeakEasy. The TV at the bar kind of threw the whole thing off though. Unless there is some big event that everyone wants to watch like the Derby or Super Bowl, it should be turned off. It really detracted from the cool ambiance the restaurant had.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and they truly have it all-even Screaming Eagle which is rare to find. If you go, get the Filet Mignon and you will have a fabulous dinner!"

The room is very comfortable, lots of wood and stained glass and two of us noticed that it was a nice change that we were able talk with out shouting even though the room was busy. Our waiter, Vic, was wonderful, very professional, and helped us thru a couple high maintenance food allergy food requests.  I started with a crab  cake - excellent, no noticeable filler, just good well seasoned crab. My friends liked their salads. I had one of the best veal chops ever, my friends had a steak and a lobster tail, both excellent, the steak cooked perfectly. The sides are  big enough to share. I thought the au gratin potatoes might have been a bit too cheesy, but still quite delicious. The wines by the glass seemed reasonable, for vegas, and the pinot noir I had was a good choice, our waiters recommendation, with the veal. The deserts were good, I had a flourless chocolate cake and it was one of the richest, best ever. We casually mentioned during the meal that all three of us were celebrating our birthdays and when the check came, the deserts had been comped. Yay! nice touch. Thanks guys.  I only have one complaint  - when our waiter delivered our steaks, he asked us to cut into the middle to check that they were cooked correctly. I HATE THAT!!!!  I expressed my hatred to that bullshit practice, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically, to our waiter. It's not voodoo, its a matter of temperature and if the \"cooks\" cant tell if the steaks are cooked to order, they shouldn't be in the kitchen or just use an instant read thermometer. In a dim room, cutting into the center is a crap shoot, you cant see well. and even if you can, I don't want  to. Hopefully he passed my message on to management.  All in all, it was an excellent dinner. Everything, food, service and ambience were great. I plan on returning soon."

            "review": "One of several restaurants inside The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino, Vic & Anthony's is a classic steakhouse, full of old Vegas charm with a modern twist. While not inexpensive, the menu provides value if you order correctly because the portions are HUGE - almost too big to share between only two people! My best friend and I shared an amazing artisan cheese plate (market price, $26), each had a salad (she, the Pear & Saga Blue Cheese; me, the Classic Wedge) and finally split Chicken Paige. In the salad course, we questioned how we could even ATTEMPT to eat our entree, so large were the two previous portions. \n\nOur table service was perfect: a charming, well-informed waiter, at the ready with suggestions. The host/hostess stand could use a few pointers, however. Our 8:30 PM reservation became a 9:00 PM seating, seemingly because a wedding party staged an impromptu post-ceremony dinner. Likely because the restaurant sits on the main corridor of the Golden Nugget's shops, bars and restaurants, its seating area is limited to one, very small, two-person bench. Waiting consists of wandering around in the fluorescent horror of the meeting point of consumerism and casino gambling or clinging to the wall inside the dark hipness of the restaurant, with the glow of the cold case and lobster tank as light sources. That's jarring enough, but the hostess and host talking about how much they hate Friday nights while failing to recognize incoming guests isn't exactly a confidence booster. Thankfully, we shook the wait off easily once we were seated.  \n\n This is old school, coursed dining, so don't expect a quick meal between table games or use it as a stop on a stroll of Fremont Street. Prepare to linger in its dark, vintage ambiance over an incredible wine list, a menu filled with a options a plenty (even vegetarians can find something) and some great people watching. DO heed the warnings about entree and side sizes: either go hungry or attempt to choose one side for every two to three people at the table. The desserts we saw were far closer to individual size, but - especially after a meal like one could easily have - sharing those might be an excellent idea too.\n\nWhile casual dress seems allowable, select something finer and have a time-honored, high roller Vegas dinner, even if you don't gamble!"

Located in the Golden Nugget in front of a chocolate shop, you walk in and see their meat display and lobsters, dim lighting, cozy setting with the chairs close but not too close to each other, friendly and quick service, and oh the food. My husband usually only gets one thing when we go to steak restaurants and that is a filet mignon. Lets say he has had quite a number of filets and this place served it just perfectly. The filet was the perfect texture, not rubbery or chewey, melts in your mouth, wonderful color when cut, and does not need any help to boost the flavor because its all there. I had a few bites and it was excellent. \nI have never had a sea bass and since they had it on special I went ahead and ventured on in there and ordered their sea bass. I was not disappointed at all. I like my fish a little salty and again this did not need any salt or boost, it was everything I expected and more. Their potato puree is amazing as well. Their bread is great and since it was our anniversary we got a complimentary cake. Layers of chocolate, peanut butter and raspberry. It was a big slice as well and we were already too full to finish it but oh it was delicious as well. Our server was polite and fast."

Vic & Anthony's was more than accommodating.  While their private room could not fit our group of 26, they made sure to place us in a somewhat cloistered area at 3 large tables.\n\nThe service was amazing.  The lead waiter was constantly checking with me, my husband, my father, and my father-in-law to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction.  Even though we had a large group, the kitchen and servers managed to get each course out to the entire group at the same time.  When it came time to cut the cake, the lead waiter brought it out for a very nice presentation, then took it back to be cut.  The restaurant gave us no problem for bringing in our own desert, and only charged a small cake cutting fee (which is pretty standard).\n\nThe food was some of the best I've ever had, and I am a real foodie.  The restaurant allowed my guests to order off of the standard menu which was really nice since so many places require a large group to have a smaller set menu.  The crab cakes were the best I had ever had.  Everyone who ordered steak really enjoyed it, and my in-laws said it was the best steak they had ever had.\n\nThank you to everyone at Vic & Anthony's who made my wedding dinner an amazing event.  It was well worth the cost!"

The place is dimly lit & has the old school darker decor with some framed pictures on the wall. There is an intimate feel but not crowded like I've seen at other more modern strip casino steak restaurants where you are seated close to others but yet can barely hear your own conversations because of how loud it is.\nI felt comfortable to have been wearing jeans, a nice top & heals, without feeling under dressed. It is definitely not a shorts & sandals kind of place but how many steak restaurants are aside from Outback? \n\nJim was our server & he was professional, polite, & came around just enough times to make sure we were taken care of but also allowed us to enjoy our dinner. His team was also very efficient in quietly clearing the table in between courses. \nWe started by splitting a Caesar salad. It was good but nothing special. I had the 12 ounce filet and husband had 14 ounce prime NY strip. Both were cooked to our liking & seasoned well. The steaks were moist & very flavorful. My filet was the cleanest piece of meat I have had. I had absolutely no gristle & didn't cut away any bit of it. It was tender & needed no sauce whatsoever. They were served on piping hot plates that kept the steaks very warm but didn't cook it. \nWe also ordered au gratin potatoes & steamed asparagus. Potatoes were slightly saltier than I liked but very creamy & cheesy and decadent. Asparagus were cooked perfectly, al dente. \nThe food was so good, we laughed at how quiet we both were, just savoring every bite & not saying too much. \n\nWe finished off the meal with some really good coffee & a nice chocolate mousse  that was a perfect end to the incredible meal. \n\nIve been to a few steak places in town but compared to some places I have been to such as Strip Steak, Hugo's Cellar (both horrible meals & we felt ripped off by the first)The Barrymore (great meal), Flemings, Mon Ami Gabi, Morton's, SW Steakhouse, Sonoma Cellar, Del Friscos, and Hanks to name a few, this was the meal we enjoyed the most! \n\nNow the bar is set."

If you've been downtown Fremont street you know what I'm talking a bout. It's a freak show, my retinas are still burning from the human filth that scoures the area.... Well once inside the place it's old Vegas , high back leather, dim lights, service was spot on, real good, but not bothersome. They tend to your every need. Good wine selection and wow, I drink bourbon, they had a list of high end stuff to choose from, very nice, we had roast beet salad, Caesar salad which they were more than happy to split for us, filet mignon, and of course lobster tails. Steak was great, cooked to our likes! Perfect. And the lobster was fantastic... Tender, sweet, and cooked so well. They don't give you the greasy butter bath to dip it. It needs nothing but cut and enjoy, so we'll done. It's not a cheap experience, dinner for 2 was over 300 with of course a well deserved tip ! When back in town, I will go back to Vic's! Tackle the 35 oz cold water lobster tail. One more thing. We dressed nice, you'll see tourists wearing hawaiin shirts, one ass wore shorts and flips, dress right people, they won't stop you from dining if your that guy. But you make the place a lil less with your old ratty clothing.... Oh, I would of went 5 stars.... Take away one for the young snooty girls who work the front desk and seat you. Lighten up ladies, your not solving the worlds problems, they don't make you feel welcome... They act like they are doing you a favor! Not a good first impression. I almost told them to stuff it...

Here's my break down and I think you'll see why I  had to go with four:\n\nFood: 4\nPrice: 4\nService: 5 (can I give more than five?)\n\nSo now lets talk about those points:\n\nFood: The food is delicious. Excellent quality and flavor. I also love their extensive wine selection.\nWe ordered-\n-Crab cake app: just ok in my opinion, everyone else loved it.\n-Chips & strings: didn't like it at all, again everyone else did.\n-Roasted beet & goat cheese salad: delicious.\n-Lobster bisque: delicious. I am a freak who hates bisque and even I liked it.\n-Crab legs: You don't get a ton, but these are excellent quality and just cooked perfectly. Love.\n-8 oz. Filet: Ordered it medium rare and that's how it came out. I didn't try it but the person who did loved every bite.\n-Bone-in Ribeye: Thank God for cows. Again, it came out cooked perfectly and was just... amazing.\n-Au gratin potatoes: Yum!\n-Mushrooms cooked in wine sauce: Holy hell these were amazing. My expectations were low enough that these were actually the shining star for me. \n-Cheesecake: The best. Just perfection. The crust is to die for.\n-Flourless chocolate cake: I'm a chocoholic. This was sublime.\n\n\nPrice: I, and everyone else in the party, eat at top steak houses on a fairly regular basis. We know great steak and we know how much it costs. I feel like because of where V&A's is located and it is Vegas, you're sort of a captivated audience and they therefore stick it to you price wise. Is it worth it? That's up to you. It was for us. We would go back, keeping that in mind, and perhaps not go as crazy with the ordering again. Bottom line is that we would go back.\n\nService: I feel like I saved the best for last. I am kicking myself for not making a note of our servers name because he was superb. When you think of high dining and the service that should accompany that, this guy blew those expectations out of the water. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated by an equally friendly/polite seating hostess, who just blew my mind with this next thing-- I was wearing black so she replaced their standard white napkins with a black one for me so I wouldn't get white lint on my black clothes. That's honestly never happened to me and I've been to really high end restaurants before. I love that extra attention to detail, and the pleasant surprise. Our water glasses were never empty. Everyone that works in V&A's was just so helpful and attentive. So, back to our server: he asked how were enjoying our time in Vegas and we told him that we were supposed to be seeing Elton John but the show was cancelled at the last minute. So, you know, the trip wasn't exactly going great. But we were in this amazing restaurant and had a bottle of Merry Edwards on the table, so come hell or high water we were going to have a great night. Well, aside from the flawless service we received, our server remembered our sad story and brought us a dessert plate he had put together since he felt bad for us. Um, what? Maybe this is sad statement on the people we encounter in our day to day lives, but we were all shocked. Vic & Anthony's has nothing to do with Elton John or Caesar's Palace. He could have just left it at \"I'm sorry your show was cancelled, that sucks.\" And we would have been happy and never thought anything of it. But this man went above & beyond to make sure we had a memorable evening, even if it wasn't the one we had planned. \n\nI want so badly to give them 5 stars, but I feel like I would be cheating other people who read this review. If I was rating on service alone then I would give them 10 stars if I could. I just feel like V&A's has a small way to go with the food and especially the pricing. For my own personal taste some things just could have been better. Again, I did say we would go back if we are ever in Vegas again (which I'm sure we will eventually). Next time I'm trying the stuffed salmon."

I started with the Tuna tartare with citrus vinaigrette and chips. The tuna was really fresh and high quality and with the classic company of avocado and the crispy chips it was a great start. My company had the scallops with appleslaw/bacon and a tabascovinaigrette. This was even better then mine and the combination of perfectly seared scallops and the appleslaw together with the spicyness of the tabascovinaigrette was awesome! \n\nFor a maincourse i took the medium fil\u00e9 that was juicy and good pared with a peppercorn sauce that was ok but nothing special. Me and my company shared a side of mashed potatoes and this was the big dissapointment. I prefer my mash silky smooth like for example at the Boa Steakhouse in L.A or the now closed Dakota Steakhouse but this mash was full of lumps and the potatoes had its skin left. I know that some people think lumpy mash has this good old home feeling but that aside the mash lacked any flavor. So this was a real downside. \n\nI rounded of the dinner with a classic creme brul\u00e9e with berrys wich was good but nothing i will remember. My companys chocolate cake was a step up and she was really happy with it. \n\nIf the steaks and vibe of the place is worth a 4 there something more then the bad mash wich brings the points down. The service was not close to the service i remembered from my first visit. Our waiter made us feel rushed and felt a bit annoyed by the fact that we wanted to eat the appetizer before deciding on our main dishes. Whats the problem? \n\nSo for us the appetizers wich should not be missed gets 4,5 , the steaks gets 4, the sides and the service gets 2. All and all a solid 3 pointer. Would go back but hopefully get a better waiter. And skip the mash and try the gratin or potatoes lyonaise instead."

Instead of going to the in house bar to wait, we went to the casino cocktail lounge around the the corner and watched the shark tank and sports updates until we were called by the hostess for our seats.\n\nThe venue is dark, classic steak house, it was busy, but it was also very private, as someone stated before, there are many restaurants which has a fishbowl effect with people gawking at you while dining, its not the case here. I've seen a few local celebrities here while dining. A good spot if you want to keep a low profile.\n\nThe service was top notch. Our drinks were refreshed regularly, the staff was friendly and the courses were served in a timely fashion.\n\nPricing is appropriate for a US prime steakhouse with market prices for beef and seafood. We never had any of the seafood so the review is focusing on the steak.\n\nStarted off with cocktails and the bread roll which was very nice, soft and warm with whipped butter and a crispy crust.\n\nFollowed that up with a Cesar salad and chili, the salad was ok, with a nice balance between tart and creamy. The chef special soup for that day was a prime beef chili which was horrible. They added sugar and what seamed to be off the shelf chili powder.. it wasn't much better than the stuff you get out of the can which is really unfortunate.\n\nThe main entrees were cooked properly, nice well marbled beef with our table having steaks cooked from rare to medium, it has the buttery flavor you often see with the Salamander prepared steaks.\n\nThe sides we had was Brussels sprouts, the potatoes au gratin, mash potatoes, asparagus and creamed spinach. All were excellent speaking from a standpoint that I hate brussel sprouts generally. The au gratin potatoes was loaded with cheese so expect a fair bit of grease.\n\nWe skipped dessert. \n\nIt's a nice option to have in downtown vegas, I'll be back again."

The service was great, our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. Maybe I just had too high of expectations, but I've been to a better steak house in Reno. I'm not saying it was bad, but just not great. I ordered the Prime Strip and it was cooked exactly how I ordered it, but I wasn't too impressed. My husband ordered the veal which was pounded very thin and breaded, it seemed there was more bread to meat ratio. I also ordered the onion strings on the side, which came out as a huge mound on a plate (not very appealing) and they were mediocre, no better than you would get at a fast food joint. Luckily the desserts were delicious. I ordered the pecan crusted ice cream with caramel sauce, it was amazing. I can't remember the dessert he ordered but it was so good he was tempted to order another. So overall I think it was worth 4 stars. I don't think I would go back during future trips to Vegas, I'd like to try somewhere else."

They were good.\n\nI ordered the Chefs Special; an 8 oz filet and lobster with pur\u00e9ed potatoes. Not sure they know how to. cook a steak medium well vice medium. I asked for my filet to be cooked medium well. It came out medium. Our server then proceeded to take the steak off my plate so that they could cook it to medium well. When it came back out it was significantly charred on the outside, and still medium on the inside - unbelievable.\n\nThe lobster was delicious. It was served atop a garlic butter sauce. This was the perfect accompaniment. The pur\u00e9ed potatoes were too salty to eat.\n\nMy mate ordered the ribeye. From my understanding it was just \"alright\". \n\nWe also ordered the scalloped potatoes. They were good but very rich. \n\nThe manager comped my filet and offered to have something else made for me, but I politely declined. \n\nWe thought we'd pay our bill and then hit the strip, but suddenly a ginormous piece of red velvet cake and two mini cakes aside it came to our table. We were informed that the cake was made in house. We were doubtful of this as it was ice cold and appeared to be store bought. It was okay nevertheless.\n\nWill I return? No. There are too many far better steakhouses in Las Vegas.\n\n5 stars for the service. 2.5 stars for the food. My total rating for Vic & Anthony's is 3 stars."

Luckily for us, the restaurant is located at the Golden Nugget, where we were staying. We also received a $125 gift certificate for the restaurant after attending a timeshare presentation. It seems like we were destined to dine there!\n\nWe were able to make a reservation easily through OpenTable on the Yelp app. As we entered the restaurant, we were awed by the restaurant's display of live lobsters as well as steaks and huge lobster tails. The restaurant itself was dimly lit and had jazz music playing in the background.\n\nThe food at Vic & Anthony's was delectable! To start off our meal, we had the seared scallops with crisp apple slaw; the scallops were perfectly seared and paired well with the mouthwatering apple slaw. We also had the pear and saga blue cheese salad; loved the combination of flavors! My boyfriend and I both ordered the filet mignon and shared a side of au gratin potatoes. Both of our steaks were tender and cooked perfectly to our preference. We ended our meal with their vanilla bean creme brulee...yum!\n\nThe service at the restaurant was fast, attentive, and accommodating. When we first got there, the hostesses were friendly and they promptly guided us to our table. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, and even gave us some wine samples to help us choose what we wanted to drink. Our water glasses were never empty, and our completed dishes were taken in a timely manner.\n\nOverall, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse has tasty food and amazing service!"

This place is good but nothing to run home and tell my mom about. \n\nPros: Server was kind, food was served quickly, steak was cooked as we asked, proportions were large, drinks were strong, dessert was comped because we were celebrating our anniversary, water glasses were always promptly refilled \nCons: We were NEVER addressed by our last names although we had a reservation, tons of people were wearing shorts and flip flops, we were never offered bottled water (automatically served tap), not the best steak we've ever had :(\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the crab cake, one large cake with a butter sauce that is richer than Bill Gates and the oysters Rockefeller, good but was just an oyster with spinach, bread crumbs and cheese. Entr\u00e9es were both steak, better than most places but nowhere near the best. For sides we had the au gratin potatoes which needed more potatoes for all the cheese and creamed spinach which was a bowl of the same stuff on top of our oysters Rockefeller. Dessert was pretty darn good though. Croissant bread pudding was the highlight of our meal.\n\nBottom line is that the place is good but not great, I say check out the band in the lounge area....they are awesome!!! Prime in the Bellagio and Anthonys in The M Resort are still my top two steaks in Vegas!"

I mean, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left, perfect. \n\nI came here on a Saturday evening a few weeks ago with my friend to celebrate my 30th birthday. The only thing I wanted out of this dinner was a perfect filet mignon and a drink, and that's it. While I appreciate a nice steak, I'm very basic in what I'm looking for. I really only want to talk about the food, so suffice to say the service and ambiance were perfect. I have nothing to complain about, so let's get to the food. \n\nOur appetizer was quail -- absolutely perfect. I wish I could use profanity to explain the amount of motherlovin' flavor on those guys. Yeah there's not a lot of meat, but oh my face they were perfect. The flavor was absolutely on point and they were cooked to perfection. I, at that point, was pretty ready to die. We also each ordered the lobster bisque: I personally thought it was on point, but my buddy said he thought it should've had more texture. My buddy ordered the special that night, which was a buffalo steak served with mashed potatoes and scallops. I ordered the filet mignon, cooked medium. Both were perfect. I mean, I'm an ok cook, but I'm in the d-league compared to the gentleman who cooked our meals.\n\nThe place isn't cheap. For us two dudes, our total was somewhere around $200. That total included 2 lobster bisques, quail, filet mignon, buffalo, and we each had one drink. All in all, totally worth it. As a matter of fact, I think I know where I'm going for my 31st birthday!"

If you want a memorable wine experience, enlist the help of the sommelier. This wonderful French gentleman picked a lovely French Chablis and Bordeaux-like Napa blend for our meal. I described our tastes (oenophile sister to Merlot Mom) and he delivered selections that exceeded our taste buds.  \n\nI ordered from the Prix Fixe menu and was a fan of the Haricot Verts. Wonderful!! Filet was ordered medium-rare but was pretty rare... too rare for me. The waiter did warn us. Creme Brulee comes in a flat dish  vs. ramekin so you get more burnt sugar than flan. My sister had the Oysters Rockerfeller and it was tasty. I ordered the bacon appetizer and yes, it tasted like a sweet bacon dish. I was expecting more of a Pork Belly phenom. \n\nThere were 7 of us for a family reunion and the reservationist delivered what I asked... a quiet area so my hard-of-hearing dad could hear the conversations over the dinner din. Bravo and Thank you! Great experience. \n\nCON: restrooms are in the casino -- quite a walk and not a direct route."

First off, this place was amazing, the food was excellent, the service was superior to many other \"fine dining\" establishments and all in all it was a great experience.  The only tiny downside is how close the tables are to each other so it was a bit hard to talk but other than that everything was on point.\n\nHector was our server and he truly made the experience phenomenal.  His recommendation of the Peju wine made a good meal great and even though my friend and I sat there for 2 hours he never rushed us, checkin when it was appropriate, kept our wine glasses full and all in all gave top notch service.  You rock Hector and I would come back just to hang out with you again.\n\nThe food consisted of three courses of mouth watering goodness.  We both had the preset menu and it was worth every penny and then some.  \n\nLobster Bisque - I seriously could have just had a big bowl of this and been completely happy.  It was creamy and smooth, rich but not too rich, a hint of tomato and nice sized pieces of lobster.\n\nCreamed Spinach - ok confession.  I love, love, LOVE creamed spinach.  And when a place does it well like Vic and Anthony's does I love it even more.  Ugh just cannot say enough good things about this dish.\n\nFilet Mignon - excellent cut, cooked just right.  Soft and flavorful.  Excellent.  I ordered mine medium while my friend ordered hers medium well and both came out perfectly cooked.\n\nChocolate Mousse - ok lets be honest.  By this time I was stuffed so it was hard to eat anything else but I did try it and it was creamy and fluffy and if I wasn't ridiculously fully I would have probably ate the whole thing.  \n\nSo, all in all a great night of eating and drinking and seriously one of the best meals overall I've had in a long, long time."

            "review": "EXCELLENT.\n\nI know there are a ton of options for fine dining in Vegas, but Vic and Anthony's was really exceptional for a number of reasons. \n\nFOOD:\nI came here with a group of 7 and 5 of us ordered from the $50pp 3 course prix fixe menu, which boasted some great options. I opted for the lobster bisque for the first course, fresh fish a la nage for the second, and creme brulee for the third. The lobster bisque was HEAVENLY. It was rich, butter, and full of lobster meat. The fish (it was salmon) was served with delicious sauteed carrots, haricots verts and zucchini and was topped with crab meat. Very tasty. The creme brulee...... I had a bit of a spiritual moment with that dessert. It was served in a large, flat dish so there was a lot of crispy, delightful caramelization to break with a spoon. Beneath the crunch top was an absolutely decadent creme, chock full of vanilla bean. It was so good I actually cried. It was so good I turned down bites of my boyfriend's chocolate mousse cake. It was so good I kept eating it and eating it even though I thought I was going to burst at the end of the second course. I have seriously never eaten a dessert THAT good. \n\nSERVICE:\nExceptional. Our waitress was patient and attentive, making sure that we were well taken care of. My glass of water was never left empty. My empty plates and used utensils were taken away at just the right time. Our food was well-timed and we were treated very well.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nPersonally, I think Downtown Vegas (Fremont Street) is about 1000% cooler and hipper than the strip. The Golden Nugget, in which Vic and Anthony's is located, is a classy establishment with a dash of funk and fun from the vibrant promenade outside. The restaurant itself is dimly lit, very classic steakhouse decor with white table clothes and dark finishes. There are candles flickering on every table. Frankly, I would have happily eaten this food on a bus or in a cab or at my aunt's house or anywhere because it was so good it wouldn't have mattered, but the ambiance and feel of this restaurant really amplified the experience. \n\nOverall, superb restaurant. Go if you have the chance!!"

However, Vic and Anthony's was amazing--a shining beacon in a land of sad, $7.95 steak dinner offers.  As said by others, this place is comparable to any fine dining place on the strip and the prices are very reasonable.  Our waiter (coincidentally named Anthony) was incredibly helpful and friendly.  \nMy boyfriend and I had wedge salads--huge and very good.  The only thing that would have made them better would have been some bacon.  (But honestly, doesn't everything need a little bacon?)  We then split the ribye and crablegs special.  OMG.  Best. steak. EVER.  It was perfectly cooked and amazingly tasty.  Perfectly seasoned, tender, and had a great beefy taste.  No steak I've ever had (Ruth's Chris, Mortons, Mastro's, Houstons...) was this good--and I love my steak.  Plus, the crablegs were huge!  I can't even imagine the size of the crab who lost his legs for my meal--he must have been the Shaq of crabs.  We also had the creamed spinach, which was good, but not great.  It was very cheesy and a bit spicy--in a good way.  \nBased on the fact that I came for steak and I was rewarded with the best steak I've ever had, I give Vic and Anthony's 5 stars."

Later on that night I wanted to go back just to have more soup.  It was the best Lobster Bisque I have ever tasted.\n\nWe shared the Porterhouse for 2.  The meat was perfection and we had the Mac and Cheese side, yes it was rich, but I was on vacation so I treated myself.  It was perfect.\n\nFinished off with a complimentary Cr\u00e8me Brulee to celebrate my sister's birthday.  It was very delicious.\n\nI will say the meal was amazing and the service was 5 stars.  Will definitely eat here again.  I hope I get the same waiter."

Vic & Anthony's delivered the perfect atmosphere, exceptional service, and  an incredible culinary experience. The atmosphere is very dim and perfect for a romantic night. Victor was our server and he delivered flawless service. I've been in food and beverage for 9 years and have worked at some of the top steakhouses and restaurants on the strip and I was very impressed by him. If I had my own restaurant, I would want him on my team- My compliments to the restaurant for finding him! He was extremely knowledgable on the wine list, recommending the perfect wine pairings for our meal and even brought tastings to ensure we would be happy with our choice. Now for the food:\n\nTo start we got the infamous crab cake (I don't even like crab) and every bite was delicious. You have to try this!! \n\nPear & saga salad- I was skeptical about ordering but I'm so glad victor recommended it. The BEST salad I have ever had. Everything about this salad flowed and it was perfectly proportioned. I could go on and on but do yourself the favor and get this!\n\nFor entrees I got the 8 oz filet with a side of peppercorn (loved the peppercorn but the steak was cooked so nicely and was full of flavor so it didn't even need it) and my date got the American Kobe filet special that came with lobster.\nAlso got a side of macaroni & cheese which was good but very rich (what Mac & cheese isn't?)\n\nFor dessert- OMG CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING. To die for. I was already in a food coma from the appetizers and main course but this was so amazing I finished it. Thank you chef!\n\nAll in all, out of all the restaurants I've tried, this is definitely one of the best culinary experiences I've had. I underestimated it, being located in the Golden Nugget and all, but wow- I was mistaken. Definitely don't come here unless you've got the money to spend. Our bill was $240 for 2 people but worth every penny."

We wanted a steak house for a couple of reasons; one to please the men in our party and also I have allergies to gluten and know that a steak-house menu is easy to order from.  \nWe picked Vic & Anthony's based on their yelp reviews and availability on a Friday night (during a fight weekend).  We were sat right away and our server Annette was funny, curteous, and most importantly put up with our motley crew.  The sommelier on site was great too.  I forgot his name, but he had great suggestions.  The food - oh the food! - came out at a reasonable pace and was delicious!  Our friend actually said \"I don't want to swallow because I want the taste to last forever!\"\nBecause we had a large party, we ordered a number of different items.  My personal favorite was the scallops and the cheesy potatoes.  The best part were the steaks!  They were seasoned perfectly and cooked to mouth-watering amazing-ness.  Most of us in our party work in the restaurant/bar/service industry and we were over the moon with this restaurant.\nIt was a wonderful evening of food and family.  We will recommend this place again and again.\nPS - it was fun to walk out on to Fremont Street afterwards to people watch!"

I really don't understand the hype.  I think a chain restaurant like Ruth Chris's or Capital Grille really is a lot better than this place.  I ordered the special which was a filet with a little lobster tail on top that was supposed to have a vanilla type cream on top of that with a little pile of saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms on the side and some asparagus.  All of this was sitting on a small puree of something or other.  Parmesan polenta maybe?  It took a while to get to the table and mine was completely tepid in temperature.  The whole plate - not just one item.  Here's the kicker.  They didn't reflame anything, they just put it in the microwave.  YUCK!  How can one tell this?  The color of the filet went from brown to gray.  What was I going to do at that point?  Send it all back and have them remake it all?  No.  We just won't go back, so big deal.  The flow of the restaurant is awful..  I get it, more table and chairs, more people = more money.  But for a place that has been around this long, shouldn't they know by now comfort for both servers and patrons really makes for happy faces everywhere in the restaurant?"

Two people in our party tried, for twenty minutes to get a second drink.  When the entrees (mostly steaks) were served, they looked like little brown islands in the middle of a huge white sea (large plates).  Part of a fine dining experience is eating with our eyes.  A little garnish, or smear of color on the plate would have enhanced its appearance.\nFive of the entrees came pretty close together, and the 6th was several minutes behind... NOT GOOD!  Several minutes later the potatoes, and other side dishes were served.  We were halfway through our entrees when the sides arrived.\nThis is not the kind of service one expects at a $75-$100. a plate restaurant!  I have been at inexpensive casual restaurants that send the food out with several servers at the same time, so that the meal can be enjoyed as ordered.  Don't know if they were short handed on a Wednesday night, but that problem should not be extended to the customer!"

I saw no sign of being well marbled, and it was like a steak off of an outdoor barbecue where the person buying the meat and cooking had no idea what they were doing. The side dishes of creamed corn, sauteed mushrooms, and duck fat potatoes were all mediocre at best. The creamed corn had no taste of 'creaminess', like I experienced of other 'fine dining' restaurants. Really. The corn had crunch to it, and the cream was mostly non-existent. The mushrooms were REALLY chewy. Mushrooms should not be mushy, but should definitely not be chewy. The duck fat potatoes were like home fries cooked with bacon fat. Not horrible, but something I'd expect from a breakfast house. I can't overstate the steak though. Tough, not tender, massive disappointment. This restaurant lives on it's reputation, like a lot of Vegas restaurants. I would not return to dine there. No chance."

There were about 30 of us and they had no problem accommodating us in the back corner of the restaurant. Everything about this place was good. \n\nThe service: Our waiter was Matt. He was THE DUDE to have. He knew everything there was to know about the wine, beer, food and specials. He was courteous, fun, attentive and cute.\n\nThe food: The food was outstanding. Our appetizers were crab cakes, calamari, beefsteak tomatoes and cheese, crab legs and bread. The crab cakes were to die for, they will spoil you forever for crab cakes anywhere else. The steaks were cooked to perfection, the seafood (I had the salmon) was excellent and the salads/soups were a good round up on the entrees. Their side were said to have been good, I only had the mashed potatoes which were decent.\n\nThe drinks: The drink list, wine list and beer list is extremely impressive. We had a double magnum (yes, DOUBLE MAGNUM) of Prisoner that served the entire party no problem. The beer was exclusive, you don't find what they had on their menu anywhere else very often. The bourbon my husband had was 180 proof, crazy!\n\nAll in all a great experience. I would definitely come back here again!"

            "review": "Ok. the bottom line is i ate the BEST steak that i have ever eaten in my life at this place. I was familiar with all the stellar reviews and decided to venture to Freemont to check out Viv and Anthony's. I am a huge foodie and use yelp and trip advisor to help guide me in selecting top rated establishments. I was in the mood for a steak that rivaled my previously favorote steakhouse in Vegas: Mandalay Bay's Strip steak. I was a bit skeptical that Vic's could equal the cut i had at Strip Steak. Man was i wrong. Big time! First off, i don't mind splurging for a pricey steak every once in a while as long as it is worth it. Even though i really liked Strip steak a lot, i was simply not impressed with the 18 oz size. I know for most people this is plenty big. But if i'm paying a premium i expect at least 20, preferably 22 or 24 ounces for a 65 dollar steak. Vic's bone in ribeye clocks in at either 22 or 24, and let me tell you: when i first saw it the first thing i thought to myself is \" it's a good thing i'm pretty hungry.\" The server brought it out and warned me to be careful because the plate was piping hot. He then told me to cut into it to make sure it was medium rare as i requested. I did so and it could not have been cooked more perfectly despite it's size. i took the first bite and the flavors burst through like no other steak i had ever tasted. The damn thing was so juicy that i had a little puddle that formed in the botton of the plate that allowed me to simply enjoy at as a de facto steak sauce. I cut the steak into multiple bite size pieces and completely destroyed every bite. The most amazing thing i noticed was that each bite was just like the first. It was as if my palate was cleansed after  every bite. The ladies sitting at the bar next to me were in awe that i devoured the sizeable cut in such short order. I told them that i simply couldn't help it. The damn thing was just that incredible. Needless to say Strip Steak is a thing of the past for me. THIS place is where i will eat steak exclusively in Vegas from here on out. Keep in mind how incredibly difficult it is to garner 4 1/2 stars on yelp after 200 plus reviews. This place has earned every bit of the hype. The atmosphere is intimate and has that old vegas vibe. I went on a Saturday night and there was a line, so i sat at the bar. I knew when i saw the crowd that the place must be something special. And it most certainly was. My meal consisted of oysters rockefeller that were pretty good. A bit too much spinach and parmesan, but the oysters were big and very tasty and their flavor wasn't at all overpowered by the toppings. Unlike most places. Next time i'll simply request a little less of both. I ate my steak a la carte because i knew it was huge and i didn't even want a salad to go with it. The 65 dollar cut i had is known as the chef's cut and believe me: It was worth every single penny!"

Again, it was perfect and lived up to all the expectations. \n\nDad got the distinctive dining menu with the filet option. He said it was a great steak. His side was the creamed spinich, which if you read my initial review you will know I thought it was slightly off mark last time, not so this time. The roux was prepared better and the breadcrumbs much more crunchy so everything didn't blend together. I am thrilled to see what was a good side made great. He enjoyed the wedge salad as his starter. Good as he remembered. He raved about the steak. He was thrilled everything was as good as before. Stepmom also had distinctive dining menu. She got the fish. She is not a seafood lover but wanted something different. She was blown away. However, because she is not a  super seafood lover she left the perfectly crisped skin behind. I can say it was perfectly cooked. It was just her personal taste. She enjoyed her wedge salad. Thank goodness she got the au gratin potatoes. They were ridiculously good and I cannot wait to go back to Vegas just to get them. Seriously, amazing. Seriously. Rich, cheesy, cooked perfectly, stick to your ribs perfection. Worth every calorie.\n\nI got the pear and saga cheese salad. It was a bit overdressed and the cheese not well presented on the plate. Flavors were great but I am one who likes my salad lightly dressed so overdressed is going to be a little off for me. I should point out my dad tried some of mine and thought it was perfect, so I think it really is my personal taste. I would get it again and next time alert the server to my preference. I have full confidence they will prepare it the way I prefer. I ordered the  Veal Chop and it was as lovely as I remembered. Fatty and tender. Slightly overcooked and I do mean slight. I asked for rare side of medium rare and got more medium side of medium rare. however it was still nice and rare in the middle and near the bone, this is a slight issue, I almost feel silly mentioning it but I am trying to be honest.. If we had been at straight medium, I would mark them down a star. It worked out because boyfriend prefers some medium pieces and traded some of his near bone rare pieces of his ribeye. Yea for me!\n\nMy boyfriend got the bone in ribeye and it was perfection as before. Melt in your mouth and lovely. Simply the best steak I have ever passed between my lips with the exception of Bern's Steakhouse Chateaubriand. For those who know their steakhouses that is rare and exceptional company.\n\nWe got two crabcakes for the table and they were divine, just like before. They really are all crabmeat with barely enough breading to hold it together. I am not sure how they even flip it over when cooking it. My boyfriend who gets crabcakes at every steakhouse for an appetizer said it was exceptional and very few if any were better.\n\nWe shared some of the croissant bread pudding for desert that came with the distinctive dining menu. It was amazing. Everyone at the table is bread pudding fans and we loved the idea and execution. Although the lactose intolerant in the group was disappointed to see the ice cream on top. It wasn't on the menu he saw and he cannot have it. He ate around it. He did not complain because he knows he would have been accommodated if he knew to request it and the portion was so big there was plenty that didn't have ice cream on it.\n\nService was impeccable. We will return on our next trip to Vegas for a fourth time happily."

Specifically, we got the mushrooms, which were above-average, potatoes au gratin which were like a cheese soup with very little potatoes, and uncooked and underseasoned brussels sprouts.  My salad had watery tomatoes and a really bland dressing.

We don't usually go to downtown LV, but it's actually pretty cool! \n\nAnyway... this steakhouse is great! We ordered: \n\nCrabcake appetizer -Yumm, it's basically all crab meat and no filler. Totally great. The crab pieces are gigantic and plump. It comes with a little sauce drizzled on the top with a few chopped tomatoes. Delicious! I wish I could eat some right now. This was probably the best thing I ate. \n\nFilet Mignon -Perfectly cooked medium rare. They're great cuz they verify what medium-rare means to them, so that no one gets something they weren't expecting. \n\nAustralian Lobster Tail -Mmm... So many times I have overcooked lobster and it just tastes so gross. But this was so good. Dipped in butter... yumM!! I forgot prepared, but it doesn't matter! \n\nAu Gratin Potatoes -Just cheesy potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it. So good! The potatoes are chopped into little pieces rather than sliced and the cheese is perfectly burnt just a little on top.  \n\nWe also ordered the most amazing red wine, per recommendation of the waiter. Wow it was so good. It was the first time that I actually saved the cork. Unfortunately, I can't remember what it was (perhaps I drank too much!) \n\nWe didn't have time for dessert, but I'm sure it would have been good :) Or if you're here you can skip dessert and then go across the street and get some deep fried oreos to end your night! If you are in downtown LV, definitely stop by Vic & Anthony's!"

The steaks were as big as my head. They were cooked to order, juicy, and delicious. The au gratin potatoes were all right. It tasted like they just melted Velveeta cheese over the top. And the asparagus were cooked just right. \nWas it expensive? Yes ($200; tip included). \nWas it worth it? Definitely! \nI mean, it's not like you do this everyday. And, you're on vacation.

The setting is really romantic and we were upstairs in a private area with only a few other tables.  The lobster bisque is truly the best I have ever had with chunks of Maine lobster. The portobello mushroom app was large with large chunks of tomato, mozzarella & basil.  I had the chilean seabass a la nage at it was buttery and amazing.  My fiance had a 4 1/2 lobster ($140) (the waiter recommended we share but it was his birthday) and he couldn't even eat half of it but it was cooked perfectly! I had creme brulee served in a wide, narrow dish so there was a lot of crust and it was pretty good and they brought the birthday boy a beautiful (complimentary) croissant bread pudding that was pretty great!  This place is high end so it isn't cheap but I thought it was worth the money!  Victor was a truly gracious waiter and glasses never were empty and he anticipated everything. The only thing I didn't love was the hot tea; it was bitter but I just assume the water was too hot so it didn't steep properly.  Definitely will be back.  For a great deal, go to their website for the \"distinctive\" dinner...four courses for $50!  I had it and was so full I couldn't move!"

We do not drink alcohol, and the waiter (Ben) seemed to take it as a personal offense when we declined to see the wine list.  My husband does not eat red meat, so he inquired about the chicken.  Even more offended, our waiter proceeded to tell us that \"it's cooked in a pan\" and literally just stared at us.  Finally, he said \"We're known for being a steak house.\" I think I saw him roll his eyes, but it was kind of dark in there.  I even chuckled to myself when he mentioned the high priced lobsters that he is sure we noticed in the tank on the way in.  What made that statement funny was the fact that I did look at the tank as we walked by, and it was completely empty!!  Our waiter was so rude that we basically couldn't wait to get out of there.  Needless to say, he treated us with absolute contempt when we declined the dessert menu and the after dinner cocktails.  When my husband put the gift card and additional cash in the bill binder, the waiter actually said \"I presume this is a gift card of some sort?\" then scampered off to verify it before we left as though we were some losers who planned to \"dine and dash\".  Although our meals tasted really good, it was a horrible experience."

I would suggest splitting the sides though...they're huge and way too much for one person.

It was a busy weeknight (the rodeo was in town), so while service wasn't super speedy, we were acknowledged quickly, and our server was very sweet and personable. \n\nI had the Apple Mule, upon my server's recommendation, and it was quite tasty, a nice play on the Moscow Mule, with a green apple slice as garnish. \n\nMy business partner and I started with the calamari and crabcake as appetizers. The calamari was very good, lightly battered, tender, and piping hot. Initially, we thought there was no sauce, and requested a side of marinara. The server very nicely told us that she'd have to get it from another restaurant on property, and we told her never mind, that's ok, but she got it anyway! By that time, we'd discovered that there actually was sauce! Underneath the calamari, were sweet onions with a sweet and spicy sauce. It was great! I feel badly that she got the marinara anyway. \n\nThe crabcake... Wowzers!!! I think it was the best crabcake I've EVER tasted, and I'm a seafood fanatic. Light, barely any breading and filler, sweet, with a cream sauce.. It was amazing. I'm contemplating returning just to get another. I ate the entire thing, my partner didn't get a bite. \n\nNow, to the meat! We both ordered the filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. At the first bite, I initially thought it was a little overdone, but by the third bite, it was perfect.  I think it just might not have been evenly cooked. Regardless, it was very good, and well seasoned.\n\nWe split an order of fries, and they were also tasty. Not too crisp, just enough on the outside and soft in the middle. \n\nWe didn't have enough room for dessert, so we called it an evening. The bill totaled around $150, which we thought was pretty fair. \n\nFinally, I can check Vic & Anthony's off the list. Good showing!"

Sure, I was apprehensive but V&A's is Michelin rated, granted it's just one star but, that's one more than most of the restos on the Strip.\n\nFirst off, do your research, check out their menu on the Golden Nugget website and make reservations.  They offer a prix fixe menu, which is a super deal.  It comes with your choices of soup or salad to start, three entrees to choose from, a selection of sides and a dessert to share.  For $46.95 per person, it's a super deal.  If you calculate it, between two people, you're getting one side and the dessert for free.  However, you have to know to order this PF deal, as it will not be listed on the menu nor will they offer it to you.  Think of it as an exclusive secret society menu...mwahaha!\n\nHowever to start,  we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, which seriously had to be the,  \"Best CC I Ever Had.\"  Why do I say that?  Well, it was jam packed with pieces of lump crab just as the name states, not crab shreds, crab filler or krab with a k.\n\nThe s/o and I had the Lobster Bisque, which was truly rich and creamy with bits of lobster in it.  We both literally licked our respective bowls and used pieces of bread to clean the bowls!  This LB was the,  \"Best LB I Ever Had.\"\n\nI was going to order the Sea Bass but the s/o gave me a dirty look about ordering seafood at a steakhouse.  I'm just not a fan of Filet Mignon and it's thick cut but, the s/o's right, it IS a steakhouse.  However to my delight, the FM was so tender, juicy and flavorful.  Hmm...V&A has made me a believer, maybe I've just had crappy FM in the past?  So again, this was the \"Best FM I Ever Had.\"\n\nWe both got a choice of side, which is big enough for 2-3 people to share.  We ordered the Creamed Spinach and Au Gratin Potatoes.  Both were not necessarily the, \"Best I Ever Had\" but both were quite delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we choose the Croissant Bread Pudding.  Wow, there's something about the elegance of a croissant that just made this bread pudding like no other.  Instead of being flat and heavy, it was just the opposite.  The side of ice cream was a pure delight.  So, was this the \"Best Bread Pudding I Ever Had?\"  Damn right!\n\nThe service was truly outstanding!  From the hostess, to our server and other wait staff.  My only thing was that the restaurant was really dark, or maybe my eyes are just going bad?\n\nV&A is top notch and is worth skipping the toney Strip restos.  And in closing, I'm ending this review the same way Drake ended his song, \"Best I Ever Had,\"\n\n\"See this is the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody, make sure it's that special somebody....\""

I have only been to a handful of places that even offer steaks costing more than $20 so I have limited experience here but this was by far and away the best steak I have EVER had. Melt in your mouth delicious!! Oh and the potato wasn't bad either lol :) \n\nAfter this amazing meal -Chef Rodriguez came out to thank us for coming in and then we talked about his visits to some of the #Vegas restaurants he had visited during his stay concluding there's so much to discover and it's such a fun and tasty adventure. \n\nTo our surprise the Chef presented us dessert--Cheesecake with blueberries and sauce and croissant bread pudding w/ice cream and lots of lil extras that just took it over the TOP:) \n\nThe desserts were GREAT but after taking home the bread pudding and trying it the NEXT day it seemed even BETTER \n\nWhat a wonderful dining experience-pleasant atmosphere, truly fantastic personal service, and the food was to die for. I would recommend it to EVERYONE and if you are on Death Row(Texas reference) and have to select your LAST MEAl-If you wanna feel that feeling like you've REALLY lived now-ORDER it from Vic & Anthony's!!"

Make reservations because this place gets packed. \n\nJumbo lump crab cake: the best crab cake I've had outside of Maryland.  They are not lying when they say jumbo lump and they are not stingy with it.  Barely any breadcrumbs which is what crab cake should be like. \n\nBroiled portabello mushroom: great especially with a piece of mozzarella cheese.\n\nIceberg wedge salad and Caesar salad: standard salads nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nLobster bisque: yummy!  There is a strong  taste of cognac.\n\nSea bass a la nage: the best fish dish I have ever had.  This is how all fish should taste.  It was heavenly and not only that they sprinkle it with jumbo lump crab!\n\nPrime ribeye: cooked to perfection.\n\nAu gratin potatoes: simply delicious!  I really liked the cheese it was baked with.\n\nMac & cheese: good, but the potatoes were definitely better.\n\nVic & Anthony's is one of the best steakhouses I have been to.  No complaints here."

I was tired and want a steakhouse and did not want to leave the hotel.  It ambiance is traditional steakhouse along the Morton's line . . . Morton's has always been a place I loved to go when on the road too long but that is another story . . . centered on familiarity.  And so it is with Vic and Anthony's.  I started with a Booker and suggested that an associate try one.  I thought South Africans could drink . . . well now I have two.  I had a beefsteak tomato salad, excellent, and followed it up with a ribeye and some creamed spinach.  Next time I will upgraded to the bone in ribeye.  The quality of the steak was Prime and it sang out its quality on the first bite.  The creamed spinach was spot on.  Stag's Leap bottles were 1/2 off on selected bottles.  I had some with dinner.  Finished with a espresso.  \n\nIn summary, I would have not searched it out.  But is a very good steakhouse and hits all the right notes.  So why then only 4 starts . . . now this could be really pissy but the service was over attentive . . . there is a fine balance when serving between attentive and annoying.  To be fair, I would have given them 4 1/2 stars, maybe even 4 3/4 stars, but I just can't give them a 5 star review.  I know I am a bastard . . . but in the end it comes down to the fact that I would return only  if it was convenient but I would not search this excellent restaurant out.  Instead I would be more adventurous."

They are few \"private\" tables, and we shared a bench, with a large party (8 or so.) Not ideal for a special birthday dinner.

That is was brought us back for round two a little over a month later. The food again was absolutely delish. We both ordered the 8oz filet and a 1/2 pound side of crab, pur\u00e9e potatoes and asparagus. We also had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert which is a must!!! The second time around, the service was absolutely dreadful. Growing up in this town and seeing how things work, we more often then not get mistaken for \"children who probably won't tip well.\" It is ridiculous. Just because I'm young doesn't mean I'm going to tip like shit. Now that you have given me terrible service and only touched our table once since we got our food, that is what will give you a bad tip. We constantly needed refills. Our server at one time glanced at our table, saw my husband needed and coke, then proceeded to greet the 8-top that just sat down. His spiel took almost 10 min. Fortunately we both work in the industry so we know what good service and bad service is, but when you are paying $100 per person to eat, you think the service would be above the rest. \n\n**One server does not make a restaurant terrible. It is just unfortunate that a great restaurant hires incompetent servers."

We were so disappointed.   The chicken was very dry.  It came with mashed potatoes that were nothing spectacular, just home made.  It also came with two spears of asparagus that were cooked well but bland.  We both commented that I could have made a better dinner at home.  I didn't come to Vegas to spend so much on chicken that I could have done better myself.  I was so bummed out.  We did have the scallops as an appetizer and they were pretty good on their own.  The mix that came with it had dry old bacon bits in it.  So I guess my only advice is don't bother with the chicken unless you are looking for a dried out home cooked meal arranged all fancy on a big plate.  I will say however, the service there was excellent and I give that part 5 stars."

Chef Eric has his steak cooking method down to a T. \nFrom the second we walked in the atmosphere; the server was so knowledgeable yet not pushy in the slightest way. The food from ...the crab cake to the Tomahawk, to the bone in filet, to the bone in ribeye, to that lobster tail was unbelievable. \n\nI work at a steakhouse on the strip here in Vegas, but was beyond impressed tasting Chefs food. It was an unreal experience. \n\nCrab cake- sorry but holy F@&k!!!!!!! So much crab. Big, thick, a light lemon bur blanc sauce. 5stars\n\nQuail- enough to share for 6 ppl, the nice spice was perfect for the dish\n\nTar- tar make it as salty as you'd like, as it comes on a salt block. \n\n48oz tomahawk Australian Wagu- speechless. Full of flavor. The best cut of beef I've ever had\n\n15oz 180 dry aged Bone in filet- bucket list. Crossed off. Couldn't ask for something more worth trying. \n\nOther guest got the bone in ribeye and the lobster tail. Both biggest steaks I've ever seen. \n\nDessert- biggest cheese cake ever, a chocolate cake that was as rich as some of the gamblers here in Vegas, and a bread pudding that would knock you off your feet. \n\nTo finish with the beat espresso Martini I've ever hat. \n\nBy far...  The best steakhouse in town."

I'm dinging a star from the review because I had to call multiple times to get everything correct: finally they just gave me the manager's email address and we corresponded that way.  After you visit the restaurant you can see why they have so much trouble: they take the reservations from the front desk, and it's just too loud.\n\nSo I was in charge of preparing everything for 10 Japanese executives. Over email with the manager we created a set menu that had everything except dessert already decided.  They did a great job getting everything ready for us.\n\nOur menu was three appetizers (quail, crab cakes, jumbo shrimp).  My guests liked the quail and crab cakes, but the jumbo shrimp was pretty ordinary for them.  I liked the quail.\n\nWhat I thought would be the most boring part of the meal got the most positive response: the iceberg wedge salad.  The dressing was very good, and they way it's presented makes it appetizing.\n\nNext up was the filet mignon.  I had them cook the steaks medium with only salt and pepper.  Vic&Anthony's has a lot of options for sauces, but I think simple is always best with great meat.\n\nI met with Brian who manages all of the wine and explained the budget ($50 per person for initial drinks: beyond that each person must pay their own way).  This is a typical way Japanese groups handle these outings, because it gives some slack on what drink choices are available.  Brian suggested a magnum bottle of a good cabernet sauvignon, which hadn't even occurred to me.  It really impressed my guests because you don't see magnum bottles in restaurants very often in Japan.\n\nWe ran out of wine just before they served the steak, so I went in half with one of our younger guests for a standard sized bottle of wine.  I wanted to get an idea of the wine markup, so I asked for a bottle of something I knew they would have.  Based on the price they quoted me, expect to pay between 2~3 times winery prices, which is a little on the high side for restaurants, but they brought out the decanter as well, so factoring in everything involved I can understand the higher prices.\n\nOn the tasting room: it's private but not closed off from the rest of the restaurant.  Think of it like a VIP room in a club and that should give you a good idea.\n\nThe service charge was included in the bill (20%), and if you pay with a credit card they'll ask to see some ID."

We decided to have a selection of appetizers instead of an entree and she helped us decide on the perfect selection.  We started with the fresh oysters - there were 3 different kinds and Megan explained where each came from.  The oysters came with lemon, horse radish, cocktail sauce, and my new favorite dipping sauce for oysters - balsamic with green onions - divine!  The pear and saga bleu cheese salad was yummy and the calamari was perfectly prepared.   We also enjoyed the jumbo lump crab cake which had large lovely pieces of crab and just enough breading to hold it together browned perfectly - just the way we like it.   We finished off the evening with an amazing chocolate cake - again Megan's suggestion.  If you are near the Golden Nugget, I highly recommend visiting with Megan at the bar in Vic & Anthony's.

Basically, it was too salty, buttery, and lacked the finesse that such a high-end restaurant should have.\n\nWe got a variety of meat and vegetable dishes. The meat was very good. But the vegetable dishes - potatoes au gratin and mushrooms - were very mediocre, too fatty and salty, and lumped in such a big quantity in big dish, slightly unappealing. No elegance.\n\nThe deserts were also extremely mediocre. We got the key lime and the chocolate mousse. The key lime had a huge crust... the chocolate mousse didn't taste interesting... it felt basic.\n\nAlso, I didn't like the fact that the waiter pushed the most expensive wine first, then the next expensive one... it was a bit obvious.\n\nThis is not a place I'd come back to. If the prices were half of what they are, I might, but at this value, it doesn't seem worth it to me. I guess what I'm saying is, it should be priced at half the price it is. That would be fair."

We asked for a fresh glass and they demonized us, saying we we re the bad guys. We had basic expectations of service - that they would appreciate our time and money, but Vic's decided that they could treat us how ever they wanted - that our time was not important and that they could treat us however they want. The service was extremely disappointing. I will not recommend the restaurant to others - and I hope others will recognize that Vic's does not care about the quality of their experience and that they give extremely poor service"

Our waiter was super nice and printed it for is and allowed us to order from it. Thanks :)\n\nI had the filet and the husband had the fish of the day (halibut). My filet was perfectly medium rare and the sides, au gratin potatoes, were to die for. For real. I'd die for them. Husband's halibut was a bit dry on top, but the flavor was very good. We also got bread pudding for dessert. Amazeballs. The other two diners we were with enjoyed their meals as well. Lobster bisque is apparently fabulous and the roasted chicken was perfect. \n\nGo here. Spend the money ($50 for a 3 course, with side, prix fixe). You will not be disappointed."

We'd heard so much about the service and food and the restaurant lived up to the hype! \n\nFOOD & DRINKS: We had the Bone Marrow w/ bruschetta, which is a phenomenal dish. However, it is heavy. I was only about to eat about half the bone marrow before I was ready to move on to something lighter. My two favorite dishes was the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and Steak tartare, which was both the best I've ever had! I would come back to just eat both dishes all day. The crab cake was juicy, meaty and the sauce really made it a well-rounded appetizer. The steak tartare was unique and different. The rare steak went well with the chips and whole grain mustard. It's served on top of a Himalayan Salt Block too! The steak was tasty and cooked well. \n\nSERVICE: Excellent service, but they did seat us near the entrance so it was a little noisy and we were hit a few times by the traffic coming in and out of the entrance. \n\nAMBIANCE: Typical steakhouse that is dark and busy with a lot of fun conversations happening around us, which I absolutely love!\n\nPRICE: Great value for what we received. The dishes were unique, the presentation was pretty and the service was great. \n\nOverall, I give this place a 4 out of 5. I would definitely come back again. :-) \n\nHappy DIning, \n\nJ Tran"

Attitude!\n\nI would have given this place a higher rating if it weren't for the AWFUL service  and SNOBBISH attitude we received from the blonde hostess when we walked in!  If I wanted to be treated terribly, I would have stayed home and dined at \"Mastro's\" in Beverly Hills.  Take my advice guys, dine else where!  There are plenty of better steak houses in LV that will treat you like a human being!  \n\nI have always wanted to try this steak house but always dine across the street at Binion's Ranch.  But this trip I had a party of 5 that I needed to entertain and they have all been to Binion's, so we decided to try a new place and Vic & Anthony's was the choice.  I booked the dinner reservation about a month in advance for a WEDNESDAY night when I knew they would NOT be busy, however when I arrived EARLY for our reservation, I was immediately greeted by a RUDE, OBNOXIOUS, SNOBBISH, L.A. wanna be little blonde starlet who treated me awful and refused to give me any service or grant me the option to seat us at a comfortable round table!  Her response?.....oh, sorry sir, the round tables are RESERVED!  We can only seat you where we can seat you!  (This was coming out of her mouth at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night with a total of 2 parties dining in the entire restaurant and probably only 5 reservations for that night!  What a joke) and by the way, the round tables were available the ENTIRE NIGHT we were there!  4 hours and $860.00 later, I left Vic & Anthony's with a bitter taste in my mouth but not from the meal, it was from the blonde hostess who's unwelcoming attitude will assure that I never return to this restaurant and discourage others from dining here as well.  \n\nThe Bottom Line:\nAwful rude service from the front, an extra salty steak that isn't great (but good), but surprisingly; probably one of the best Veal cuts one could ever taste! \n\"Try the Veal, it's one of the best in the city\" - Godfather\n\nEnjoy!"

The first thing that put me off was the fact that most people were wearing jeans and t-shirts, a few had shorts. When I am spending $300 on a special occasion I like to dress up a little, if I wanted to sit next to loud and drunk people in jeans and sneakers I could have saved over $200. Service was very good but not perfect, plates stayed on our table for 10 minutes after we were done. Filet mignon was the best I ever had while the rib-eye was ok, lots of fat and one side was very tough. Both meat dishes were done as we ordered. Quail appetizer was sublime, I would like to see them try this with duck or pheasant. Asparagus side was very good while the scalloped potatoes were very very rich, enough for 4 people. Creme brulee was good but on a saucer plate and only 1/2 deep. Espresso was the worst I have ever had, looked it was a cafe latte as it was not black. Waiter took it off the bill and said it was a little lite? We will go back for the filets and the quail."

It is only $50/person! It includes your choice of starter. We had the wedge salad and lobster bisque- ahhhhhmazing! Next is your entree, we both chose the 8oz filet which was unbelievable and I really couldn't choose words to explain how wonderful they really were. The meal comes with your choice of sides. Be sure to choose 2 different sides as they are more than enough to share. We chose the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Delicious!

However, the giant aquarium nearby (with a tube for bathers to slide thru among the sharks) makes for a pretty entertaining place to wait. And, in fairness, once we got seated, it didn't seem like there were empty tables.\n\nOnce we were seated the service could not have been better. Our waitress struck the right balance between friendly and intrusively friendly. There were always assistant wait staff to fill water glasses and take plates away. One never had to look for the waitress for help with some item. I liked that our waitress told us the specials and the prices. I don't like to ask what the price is but I do like to know. I was a little annoyed that some of the menu items were \"market price.\"\n\nThe complimentary hot bread was not really great; it usually isn't in Las Vegas.\n\nI had the salmon which turned out to be the value meal as well as the allegedly heart healthy one. It was $29 and came on a bed of mashed potatoes, and with three big asparagus spears cooked just right, along with some diced tomatoes and capers.  My wife had the 16 ounce prime rib eye steak at $46 by itself. I had one bite and had to admit that it was delicious. It was rare with a charred surfaces. I avoid charred meat out a concern that it might be unhealthy, but it sure tasted good. She also got a monster $9 baked potato that was shared. \n\nOne of my sons had the $10 roasted beet salad as an appetizer which we passed around. It was impressively good. Another had the pepper crusted tuna which was a generous portion at $36.\n\nI would have preferred slightly softer music. \n\nIt was a tough decision whether to give this a four or five star rating. I think you can expect consistently good service and food, albeit it pricey."

Ate here for the mother's day dinner and I must say that they have some of the BEST customer service I've received from a steakhouse! I originally booked my reservation online on the opentable.com website because of the cool perks of dinning perks! Reservation was for 5:15 PM. We arrived a little early but no problem because we were seated promptly at 5:15! The ambiance in this place is remarkable we were sat upstairs in this more private seating area! What a plus that was because of the privacy and sharing the special Mother's Day occasion. Let's get to the food, oh but before I start let me tell you that the \"Mojito 23\" drink that they have on the special drink menu is terrible, if you are a regular mojito drinker like myself take my word for it, it's horrible. The main food course we ordered were mainly the Surf & Turf specials which originally came with an 8oz Filet Mignon however my brother and I upgraded our steaks to a 22OZ Bone-In-Ribeye which btw is TO DIE FOR. We added this blue cheese butter to the steak that made it mouthwatering! The lobsters that came with these orders were cooked to perfection and nice with the butter sauce. Sometimes places can over cook the lobster which makes it tough but this defiantly wasn't the case, they nailed this whole entr\u00e9e! The macaroni and cheese we ordered was horrible, put it like this we could have saved that $8.95 and went to Wal-mart and bought a box of Velveeta that would have been more worthwhile! Pass on that side dish FOR SURE! Over all other than the 2 minuses on the Mojito 23 and the macaroni and cheese I'll give this place a 4.5 stars! Will return for sure!"

There were three bartenders behind the bar providing service for five of us.....   I felt completely ignored, to the point I spoke to management.   They don't know they have a problem if no one speaks up.  He knew it was bad.  He talked to me for at least ten minutes, the entire time both my coffee and water were empty and no one did anything!   He finally said something to the bartender, and admitted he was embarrassed and sorry.  I am guessing the dining room is different.  I say again, food was amazing,I will be craving that creamed spinach!"

            "review": "If you happen to be in downtown Las Vegas and find yourself hungry for some of the best steaks in the country, I highly recommend Vic and Anthony's steakhouse.\n\nThe food was what you would expect for a top notch steakhouse... the best.  For starters, their lobster bisque and seafood chowders were wonderful.  The pear and blue cheese salad was very good and was large enough to be a meal in itself.\n\nNow to the heart of it all.  The 18 oz. Australian rock lobster tail was amazing.  The meat was sweet and crunchy, but not chewy.  It was so good, I've ordered it twice (and I'm not much of a lobster eater).  The steaks here are some of the best anywhere.  The 24 oz. bone-in ribeye and 18 oz strip were both juicy and flavorful.  The extra marbling really gave these cuts quite a lot of flavor.  Also, everything was cooked as ordered.\n\nIt is also worth saving some room for dessert.  The bread pudding here is excellent and comes with a scoop of ice cream.  It goes well with a cup of espresso. \n\nService here is excellent.  Servers are both very knowledgeable about every dish and wine selection on the menu, and may even make a suggestion for something that is not on the menu.  They are also very amenable to splitting orders into smaller portions (we had our lobster tail cut into medallions) since the portions are quite large.  Everything arrived as expected and any requests were handled promptly.\n\nThe only warning I would give is that every dish here comes in large portions.  You might have to pace yourself to enjoy the full spectrum of what Vic and Anthony's has to offer."

            "review": "WOW...\n\nI don't give many 5-star ratings. That being said, Vic and Anthony's earned all 5 with ease....\n\nWe dined here on our last night in Vegas.  Being from Houston, we were familiar with the Vic and Anthony's brand, as they have a restaurant there.  \n\nWe actually stayed in the Golden Nuggett so we wanted to have a good last night dinner somewhere in Downtown Vegas.  We'd already been to Hugo's Cellar before(awesome by the way) and we had heard Binion's Steakhouse was quite good.  \n\nWe dropped by Binion's but changed our mind at the last minute and went to Vic and Anthony's instead. In retrospect, this was a excellent decision.  The restaurant is not that spacious however, on the other hand, the coziness provides the dining couples with a much more intimate and romantic experience.  \n\nThe waiter was very courteous and immediately wished my wife a happy birthday (earning valuable points) and then guided us through the wine menu and liquor/after-dinner menu.  The wife had a crown and 7.  I had a Makers Mark 46 with a splash of 7.  If you like Bourbon, give Maker's Mark 46 a try.  Both drinks were prompt, cold and stout, just the way they should be.  \n\nWe skipped the appetizers altogether and went straight the entrees.  I do hear, however, that the crab cakes are quite good\n\nBecause they serve such large portions, we shared a 16 oz. Prime Ribeye cooked to perfection.  As sides, we had the Creamed Corn and Truffle Mashed Potatoes. \nAll were wonderfully flavored...\n\nIf you order a topping for your steak, I highly reccomend the Port Peppercorn. Have them serve it on the side, instead of on top of the steak. You won't be disappointed.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared the flourless Chocolate Cake.  This was quite good but a little too rich for us.  Should have stayed with the tried-and-true Creme Brulee.  \n\nThis place was almost as good as Hugo's Cellar in Vegas and Pappas Steakhouse in Houston.....very very close.\n\nIf in Vegas, either Hugo's or Vic and Anthony's would be an excellent choice."

We had the crab cake, lobster bisque, filet w/baked potato, chicken dish (can't remember) and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Morton's, Flemings, and Ruth's Chris have nothing on this place! Beware though...it's very dark in here. Good for a romantic dinner!"
