            "review": "In a city with less dining options this would be 4 stars. For me and my wife, this was definitely one and done. Just because there are too many great choices nearby. \n\nA good dinner if you are on the property already - I wouldn't make a special trip, or even take a cab. There are just too many other great places to eat in Las Vegas. Nice decor, reminds me of a Beverly Hills restaurant. Dim lighting - lighted menus would be nice and I expected them but no dice. \n\nI didn't feel the wine selection was appropriate either - would have been nice to have more selections by the glass. \n\nService was ok. Nice enough, I wouldn't call it warm or friendly.  Just not up to par compared to similar priced locations on the LV strip.\n\nThe raw oysters appetizer was very good, nicely presented. For sides the twice baked truffle potato was great - very good. I had the swordfish, which was good but not great or exceptional. I added the poached lobster tail, bummer. Just not what I expected, a half tail - a small one, and over cooked."

            "review": "This is a 4.5 Star Review.\n\nI was here while on my bachelor party this past Saturday. We chose Charlie Palmer's because they had the Cut of the Week deal for some of my cost conscious friends. Out of 7 of us,  4 ordered a la carte, while 3 got the Cut of the Week. \n\nThe food was all excellent. As far as the steak,  the quality of the meat and the preparation were as good as any I've had. The appetizers and sides were all very enjoyable. \n\nThe kitchen also accommodated a change to the Cut of the Week deal, which, to be honest, no one expected. It was a welcome surprise. Also, at the end of the meal the kitchen sent out two complimentary deserts for the table, which was a really nice touch. \n\nThe half-star only comes off because of slight service issues. Other than that it was a great meal and a high-quality steakhouse."

            "review": "The food was great. We had a tasty, creative 4 course meal that included a bottomless flight of wines. The service was horrendous. We had 2 waiters who were supposed to work in tandem.... Neither one ever asked if wanted another drink, if we had questions about the menu, EXPLAINED the menu, asked how we were doing, if the meal was OK, etc. I guess each waiter assumed that the other waiter had taken care of these things. They were completely disinterested in us, even after I explained how we felt overlooked and forgotten. Rude and ridiculous. Just awful. There seemed to be a restaurant full of waiters running around looking busy, meanwhile only 1/3 of the tables were full with customers. We had a third waiter who poured the flights of wine with each course. He was nice. My husband and I came here for a much needed romantic night away from our kids. It was an awkward and upsetting dinner. Although we are in our 30's, we look young for our age. Maybe they didn't take us seriously? We were certainly dressed appropriated and definitely had a lot more class than the wait staff did."

            "review": "I've had plenty of expensive, gourmet dinners in my life, but none more so than Charlie Palmer Steak at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas. Good grief was this place overpriced!\n\nI recall having a 7- or 8-course prix fixe dinner at Valentino in Santa Monica that, after tax and tip, cost something like $230 for two people. That was a memorable experience, and one that I will talk about and cherish forever.\n\nBut with this restaurant, you spend that amount (or, in our case, more: a new record of $250 for two people!) to get a 3- or 4-course dinner that meets expectations but does not surpass them in any way. To use a sports analogy, Charlie Palmer finishes the golf course at par, when you really hoped it would sink a hole in one somewhere along the way.\n\nThe starter? Good.\nThe steak? Good.\nThe cocktail? Good.\nThe dessert? Good.\n\nBut nothing was great or mind-blowing or made you close your eyes and just go, \"Mmm... delicious.\" The decor was basic -- it felt like I was in a hotel, when I really wanted to be transported to another world and forget where I was.\n\nAnd I couldn't believe how lax they were with the dress code. My friend and I showed up in our best, and were dismayed to see couples walk in where the guy wasn't wearing a tie or had his shirt untucked or was wearing jeans or, in one case, khaki shorts! I feel these people should be turned away at the door -- it definitely makes the place feel less classy.\n\nWould I eat there again? No. That doesn't mean it's bad -- not at all. It's just, for me, not worth the price. I'd rather have something that leaves a bigger impression on my senses than on my wallet."

Our sever, Yash, was on top of everything even before we know we needed anything. He made great recommendations, explained each course brilliantly, and knew just the right wines to pair with the meal. The food was equally outstanding with every course out doing the previous. Truly one of best meals I've ever had."

            "review": "The good Ol Charlie Palmer Steak House! The myth is true! Definitely one of the best steak houses in Las Vegas! From the Service to the Food leaving me with an impeccable impression and enjoying a restaurant that still follows expert high standards for service that you can clearly see in EACH AND EVERY employee! Pride passion and dedication is what I witnessed last night and it was a relief considering this is my anniversary dinner! With that being said they nailed it making it a perfect dinner, better then expected of course! The food was great! If you haven't heard of the cut of the week, please look it up! Because it is clever to go that route weather you are going on a budget, or just going for a special occasion and want to have a little bit of everything. We did the Colorado Lamb T-Bones with Harissa Powder giving it a unique flavor that matches perfectly with the wine. For those who know how big I am with wine, I can tell you the Somm is really a Genius for the Angeline 2014 Pinot Noir. That wine is kind of rare considering it was produced in a drought, and the flavors of cranberries and orange zest really bring out the Harissa Powder on that Lamb! Now on to this Black Velvet Apricots. The California  Brie really stands out because it is grilled i assume as a whole on the Wax side letting it taste outstanding as you experience literally \" A Grilled  cheese\". Now Eat that with the watercress that is tossed in a clean balsamic, and a piece of that apricot giving you an experience I guarantee you haven't tasted! 5/5 for the salad. Roasted farm squash very nice; Sweet Garlic Pomme Puree, nice to clear the pallet for the next incredible bite of Harissa Lamb! Last was the Panna cotta with coconut lime. More Lime the coconut, but the Shortcake Crumble balances it out with a beautiful texture allowing you to enjoy every bite vs some panna cotta dishes that leave you putting down the spoon as an intake of \"Too Savory\". Overall, that is a 5/5 experience for me, and the rest of you should make an effort to shoot out to CP Steak!!!"

This is a great bar, especially in the tackiness that is the epitome of Las Vegas.  The bartenders were professional, engaging, and poured a good drink.  This is a mature place for a cocktail, and if the bar is any example, I would bet the steaks in the restaurant would be excellent.  I shall return."

Only a brief wait for seating.  We ordered the Cut of the Week and MJ One special. Both are excellent for the price. I had a bone in NY strip. It was cooked as ordered and even though I am a filet girl I enjoyed it. We had swiss chard and parsnips as sides, both were good. My dining partner had red snapper, it was crisp on both sides not over cooked. Their banana foster creme brule made me wish I ordered it instead of just stealing off the hubby's plate :) Overall a very good meal and a bargain."

            "review": "I love steak and this place makes a tasty one. Dry aged beef and flavor full sides keep bringing me back. I went on my birthday with some family and friends and had a good time with good food. We first started with a dozen oysters with a champagne Mignonette that were nice and fresh but i wanted more heat maybe more horseradish. Next  was a truffle fried egg salad with prosciutto ham and a warm bacon vinaigrette very tasty! For my entre i had a bone-in ribeye cooked to perfection with a shallot sauce that was juicy and tender.  The side were flavorful as well, we had the sauteed spinach, asparagus w/ Citrus Sauce, truffle baked potato, parmesan potato gratin, and steak fries (too many potatoes). To finish the meal we had a spread of desserts, Meyer lemon tart with caramelized citrus lemon sabayon, chocolate peanut butter bar with vanilla ice cream dark chocolate sauce and peanut anglais, citrus cheesecake with blueberry compote mint essence, classic vanilla bean and mocha creme brulee. Service was excellent as always plus it does not hurt to know some of the staff.  Everyone was totally stuffed and satisfied. Not that I do this often but when you do go all the way enjoy yourself. If you happen to be there late and Billy Joel is in town its likely  he might stop in for a bite and \"Tune the piano\" for a few hours after his concert."

I was feeling under the weather, so I opted to share my husbands entree as I just ordered the soup.  He had the 24oz porterhouse and ordered me the lobster add on.  I can't seem to remember what kind of soup I had, but it was similar to a lobster bisque.  Very rich and full of flavor.  His steak was cooked just as ordered, medium rare and tastes just right.  We had the foie gras with seared pears to start off and although it was good,  I preferred BOA's on this dish.  We topped off the dinner with a bottle of Ehler's 08' Merlot.  By the end of the dinner, I was one full, happy camper."

But my worries disappeared in no time when the server started chatting with my kids, even showing them pictures of their own kids. WOW! The kids had the corn soup, with lobster and pancetta, they finished it in no time despite steaming hot. Hubby ordered the prawn cocktail, very nice. For entrees, I had the filet mignon, hubby had the ribeye, kids shared the roasted chicken. Wonderful, this really is one of the best steakhouse we've dined at. Everyone else pales in comparison. The kids saw someone ordered the chocolate bombe for dessert , they ordered that too with vanilla ice cream(which I had to stop them from licking the plate afterwards, ha), hubby and I shared an order of berries with creme fraiche, and two cups of capuccino. Perfect ending."

The food is outstanding (best steaks ever), the service is fantastic, the atmosphere the way I like it...dark and mostly quiet.  We even had a problem with a service lapse and they tripped over each other apologizing.  \n\nMy only beef, and the only reason I don't give it five stars, is that the atmosphere is slightly spoiled by a bar tucked in by the entrance with a flat screen blasting light and noise into an otherwise perfect dining setting.\n\nGet rid of the stupid sports bar nonsense, and Charlie Palmer would be perfect."

The staff is always on point. The service here is exceptional! The atmosphere is sophisticated and elegant. But the best part, the quality of the meal and which it is presented!  This is by far my favorite place in Vegas for a great dinner. The side dishes are ala carte and perfect for sharing! I recommend the au gratin potatos highly. The steaks are always cooked perfect and the best I have ever had. They always have several freshly flown in fish options. The best part of a meal for me is dessert! The banana split is to die for!! They thinly slice the banana and lightly fry it!!! Fresh baked cookies are always brought to the table or packed to go. They also have a wide selection of fine cigars in the bar to choose from. This is a guaranteed PERFECT MEAL!!"

I had a late reservation from overdosing on fun the last two nights but also since my friend gets off at 9:00pm.  in short, Palmer Steak is closed on Sunday's and I'm guessing the staff was pooped out from a long week because the service was nothing like we had at Verandah last year.  \n\nI don't know why but we had butt squeezing seats last year, this layout looked exactly like Verandah and once again I get a butt squeezing seat!  Damnit, next time I'm going to be picky with the seat.\n\nBut onto the food, my soup was good.  The soup for my first course was a potato lobster soup.  The dropped sour cream and bacon crumble inside added a wonderful taste to it.  Bravo, I love soup with this chilly type of weather.  The main attraction was supposed to be the Australian Wagyu Strip Steak, I don't know.  Maybe I would have to see this cut before believing it was a short cut portion of an Australian Strip Steak.  Loved the asparagus and potato that came with it, these always pair well with steak.  Dessert was the peanut butter sandwich thing placed on top of a dark chocolate sauce with an added scoop of dulce de leche ice cream.  I liked it but I really wanted the cheesecake!  \n\nIn all, I came here because of everyone's raving reviews last year.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the fat through the meat of the medium rare steak?  I love RW because it affords us the opportunity to try different restaurants I would normally not give a second thought to.  And the biggest thing for me is that it may make me a regular returning customer, I may return again to try their Cut of the Week that the server was explaining to us but we'll see!  Thank you for participating again in RW!"

While they are priced pretty high (to be expected at a legit steak house), they are amazing.  So, definitely make sure you try a couple of them when you're here.  The service is also amazing but it does borderline on a little excessive from time to time.  We were here for a bachelor party and I got the sense that some of the guys were not in their element with a guy pouring water over their shoulder every 10 seconds.  \n\nNow, as far as the food goes, sadly, this is where the disappointment comes in for me.  Everything was pretty good but I don't want pretty good when I go to a Charlie Palmer restaurant, I want amazing.  The portions are huge so that is nice but I tried a few of my friend's dishes (in addition to my 3-course prix fixe dinner) and they are all ho-hum for me.  The wine that accompanies the prix fixe dinner is ok at best but since it is all you can drink, I don't really think I should complain too much.  Overall, I probably will not be coming back and will stick to Brazilian BBQ for the next bachelor party in Vegas."

It's a small space that serves small plates, offers the complete winelist, and is a really cozy place for a light meal at bargain prices. We liked it the first time we visited so much we went back the next night for dinner. Their small plates are a steal for Vegas. For example the four cheese plate with accompaniments was $8, and two Kobe sliders were $10. Compare that to $17 for a Caesar side salad in the restaurant. The ambiance is great, and we had the place almost to ourselves, even though the restaurant was packed."

The clientele fit the surroundings for a high end luxury restaurant. And the live jazz/dinner music was such a delight to listen to during our meal. \n\nHowever, everything was delicious up until the steak arrived. The salad was blend of Oak Lettuce, Crunch Grapes & Camembert cheese which was paired with a fantastic Moscato (and I don't really care for white wine). I ordered the NY Strip rare because I love the flavor or the meat, but it was a bit tough. In fact, so much so that it was hard to cut through with their steak knife. My jaw was left aching after my meal and although the meat tasted savory the work it took to eat it took away some of the enjoyment of eating the steak. The Pecan pie with Caramel Ice cream was so delicious and a great way to end our meal. \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to see how the other half live, just don't expect to be blown out of the water."

            "review": "\"I'm having a fruit salad for dinner.  Well, it's mostly grapes.  OK, all grapes.  Fermented grapes.  I'm having wine for dinner.\"\n\nWe came here for a romantic night out on Saturday for our 7:30PM reservation.  It was all glitz and glamor inside this fancy dark restaurant.  I got The Cut of the Week while Mr. W. had The Tribute to Michael Jackson.  Two three-course meals, he clearly chose the better one.  Let's break it down:\n\n* The Cut of the Week [changes weekly but we'll still talk about it]:  \n\nFirst course was \"Baby Iceberg Salad with Late Harvest Corn, Bacon Lardons, Creamy Blue Cheese. Wine pairing was a Riesling, St. Urbans-Hof, Mosel, Germany.\"  It's basically a 60's-style wedge salad with a flavorful dressing and some bites of sweet corn and chunks of bacon and bleu cheese.  It was light and refreshing and a great way to start off the meal.  I ended up having two glasses of Reisling and I have no regrets.  That perfectly chilled, crisp, white wine.   Yum.\n\nThe main course was \"Marinated Culotte Steak with Truffle Butter with sides of Garlic Pomme Pur\u00e9e and Haricots Verts with Pancetta.  Wine pairing was a Merlot, Opolo, Summit Creek, Paso Robles.\"  I had it cooked a medium rare and it was perfect.  The seasoning was on-point, there was the perfect amount of pinkness, and the sides were great.  Since the husbie's three-course didn't come with sides, I shared mine and we still couldn't finish.  The potatoes were so smooth and creamy and oh so garlicy while the green beans provided a nice sweetness to the savory meal. \n\nDessert:  Warm Apple Coffee Cake with Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream.  What a perfect way to end dinner.  I had a second glass of Riesling with dessert and I was happy.  Now let's talk about that Tribute to MJ!\n\n* Tribute to Michael Jackson [you get options for your courses]:\n\nFor his first course, he chose the Brentwood Corn Chowder with Alaskan King Crab, Bacon Lardons, and Chive Batons.  Oh. My. Gawd.  This was so delicious!  It was warm and creamy and that sweetness from the corn and crab was mind-blowing.  Mr. W. scraped his bowl clean and I can't blame him.  It beats my wedge salad.\n\nHis main course was Charred Bone-In Filet Mignon with Garlic Pomme Pur\u00e9e and Black Truffle Natural sauce.  He had ordered his' medium rare and oh goodness.  It was sooo tender and juicy.  It literally melts in your mouth and has a great beef flavor.  It's a filet mignon so what do you expect?  Once again, blew my main course out of the water.\n\nFor dessert, he chose the Lemon Raspberry Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with Vanilla Chantilly and Citrus Zest Confit.  This was a citrus explosion!  It was fun and bright on the tongue and a great palate cleanser after all that red meat.\n\nThe Cut of the Week came with bottomless wine but they still offered Mr. W. the same treatment. Overall, it was a fabulous dinner and I'll definitely be back again.  I hope the Tribute to MJ menu sticks around for a while because I want everything Mr. W. had.  *kisses fingertips*  Awwww yiiiiissss!  Thank you for a beautiful meal!"

I think that spells trouble because it seemed like we were the loudest ones in the restaurant. Just having a good time out together. \nThe service was great and I was confused as to who was our server. It seemed at one point that someone else took over and it was fine. All were very courteous and nice. \nI had the pork tenderloin with some white beans that were a bit on the salty side and some mashed potatoes. The pork was prepared perfectly, but I don't think it was the absolute best I've ever had. We shared the sides...carrots, lemon infused asparagus, potatoes...all were average, nothing really moved me. \nCharlie Palmer's is worth trying. I think for what you pay for, the food should be phenomenal. I just don't think it was. Oh and a couple of the girls had the filet and were not raving about it. I'd really be back for the service, but not so much for the food."

Bottomless wine and excellent food, what more can you ask for? We will be back for their cut of the week specials, which changes every week (it's on their website) and is comparable to the restaurant week deal - complete with bottomless wine, for $58. It's a great deal for this high caliber restaurant. My only complaint is that the wait staff is a bit surly. The type of attitude you'd expect from a French restaurant, perhaps, but not a steakhouse. That's the only reason it's not 5 stars."

            "review": "This steak restaurant located on the lobby floor of the Four Seasons Hotel is not to be missed. Not very crowded at times and thats a good thing. It seems like every steak restaurant in Las Vegas is filled to the gills and annoyingly loud. I have eaten at least 10 different steakhouses in Las Vegas and this is the classiest and still my favorite. It feels like a cross between an updated clubby steakhouse sans booths, and an elegant, dark, and nicely appointed restaurant. One different aspect is the smoking section. Its this seperate beautifully sectioned off area filled with overstuffed, beautiful and very comfy cushions. It gives a feeling of a more relaxed classy dining experience as oppossed to big booths to eat large slabs of meat. I still choose to dine there and I already quit smoking years ago.\n\nThe service is excellent and extremely attentive. It will feel like you do not wait for anything. The bartenders understand the importance of paying attention to making a cocktail instead of just pouring liquor to the top and adding a splash of something.\n\nOf course if your there for steak, the most important aspect is the meat itself. Quality and portions wise, it ranks up there with the best, but its not the best. The meat is wet aged and I prefer dry so thats why I am probably put off slightly. If you prefer dry aged beef only, this is probably not for you. I always get the bone in ribeye and never left hungry or dissapointed. Everything else is a la cart.\n\nThis is a very beautiful classy way to enjoy a steak in Vegas. Bachelor parties are better off at 9ine at the Palms (Which I also have been privy to). Much more livelier and raucous, filled with the \"beautiful people\" but the food and service suffer accordingly."

However, that doesn't mean that I haven't been eating excellent food for the past couple of months.  So I am back to review some of the restaurants I've been to.\n\nThe wife decided we should check this joint out and thanks to all of you yelpers, we went for the cut of the week special.  Its 3 courses and bottomless wine pairing.  Pretty good deal for such a high end restaurant.\n\nWe started out with a salad that was disappointing.  Iceberg lettuce, tomato, beet, and feta? cheese, and a vinagrette.  The salad looked sloppily made and the beets were sliced into these very large chunks.  The wife is a salad lover and she did not finish her plate.  That says it all.  Came with a pinot grigio.\n\nThe main course was Osso Bucco and it came with sides of haricot verts and polenta.  I thought the Osso Bucco was very tender and flavorful, nice deep rich gravy to with it.  Then the wife gave me a slice of her Osso Bucco.  Tough, dry, lacking in flavor.  Very disappointed that such a highly thought of restaurant could not cook two Osso Bucco the same way.  I was going to give this restaurant a 4 star review but after tasting the wife's Osso Bucco, I docked it a star.  The polenta was nice and creamy and the haricot verts were cooked just perfectly... crisp and clean flavor.  Came with a french blend red.\n\nFor dessert we had a carrot cheesecake with a coconut lime sorbet on top..... perfect.  Gave it a slight tartiness to go with the creamy cheesecake.\n\nAs I said, if I had only eaten my own meal I probably would have given it 4 stars but the wife's Osso Bucco was so over cooked that my wife is probably writing her review and giving this joint 2 stars."

We got there for an early dinner at 5:30 and were one of two tables in the place. It took about 10 minutes to get menus and then another 10 to get water. The steak was not great at all. I had the surf and turf which is lobster and a filet mignon. The steak was not tender or soft or the way it should have been. The knife to cut it was more dull then my spoon. Either the steak should have been the way I expect an expensive filet mignon to be or the knife should have been super sharp so that I didn't notice. I was basically sawing my steak the whole time. The side of blue cheese fondue was delicious, but it was basically just a TON of blue cheese. We also got the Parmesan gratin and it was basically liquid potato mush. The only thing that was super delicious was the dessert. The Meyer lemon creme brulee was amazing.\n\nOur waiter was terrible. He only had our table to help and he kept sitting at the bar and watching some hockey game. I had to wait too many times for my water to be refilled. I will not go back. I expect a meal that cost $280 for two people to be amazing. It was not!"

Make reservations ahead of time and you should have no issue with being seated when you arrive.\n\nWe had cocktails before dinner, and then chose to order from the extensive wine list.  If you ask for the Sommelier and it's JB, he will be able to guide you through the list with ease, and you will be delighted with his extensive knowledge and exceptional service!  Our server was not as personable or as charming as JB, but he did make sure we were happy with our dining experience throughout the meal.\n\nThe menu is simple, with a few unique updates on the classic steakhouse fare, nothing too flashy, but a refreshing take on old favorites.  Below are a few highlights from our dining experience:\n\nChef's Choice Sashimi :: Buttery yellowtail with a light, tangy ponzu that cut through the richness of the fish perfectly - a definite must try!\n\nSeafood Tower :: Overflowing with seafood, the crab legs and oysters were my favorite!  Comes with a light cocktail sauce and plenty of horseradish.  The shrimp were a bit overcooked for my taste, but they were huge and full of fresh flavor.\n\nKagoshima, Japan Kobe Striploin :: My husband did not leave one bite left on the plate!  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, accompanied by a red wine sauce that was just as good as the steak.  A rich dish, so come hungry if you plan on ordering it.\n\nSorbet Tasting :: Light & SO refreshing!  Really unique flavors, a great way to have a bit of something sweet after a decadent meal.\n\nOverall Charlie Palmer is a steakhouse oasis tucked away in the Four Seasons Resort that is definitely worth a visit!  Cheers!"

I'm so glad they never took our order and we chose here to eat.  \nCP Is located within the Four Seasons. \nWe made reservations and were seated about ten minutes after our arrival. \nBetween the four of us, we ordered:\nTuna tartare, shrimp cocktail, surf and turf, porterhouse for two. \nFirst on the list:  \n1.  The bread basket\nAn assortment of breads. The cornbread, by far, was to die for. I typically don't care for it, but it was so moist and delicious.\n2.  Yellowfin Tuna Tartare \nPinkerton Avocados w/ Lavash Crisps and Citrus Ponzu:   Delicious.  The tuna was like butter and melted in your mouth.\nWe love tartare and typically choose it as an appetizer, be it beef, fish, etc.  but this dish exceeded my expectations. I could have had another plate of this and had been satisfied!  That's how delicious it was. The ponzu sauce gave this dish the extra kick and just took it to the next level. \nCitrus Marinated Wild Baja Prawns \n3.  Carrot Salad w/ Classic Cocktail Sauce: \nCousins got this dish and they said it was delicious. They typically do a shrimp cocktail and loved how this dish was prepared - saut\u00e9ed in a butter/lemon sauce. \n4.  Surf and Turf:\nMaine lobster and filet. Also ordered was the truffle potato gratin.\n5.  Porterhouse for two, medium rare.  \nWhat words can I use to describe the best piece of meat we've ever had?  Fu**ing delicious?   Yeah, that's about right!   Worth every penny. We also had the truffle potato gratin and it was just amazing. The truffle did not overpower the dish at all but added another layer of flavor that perfected a typically average side. Also ordered was the Brussel sprouts which I thought were very good. They were cooked to crispy perfection with water chestnuts.  \nThe husband has always wanted to try  blue crab so we ordered that as well. It was okay. Nothing special. But at least we can say we've had it. \nAt the end of our meal, we were given four caramel turtle cookies when we decided to not have dessert.  \nOverall, a great experience for two guests from out of town."

Saying that it was a 3 star experience amongst the greatness I experienced this week is not a lose. It was just the attentions to details that brought down the overall rating.\n\nThe food was decent. It would have been better if there was a little more option and the food coming out hotter. The potato leek soup with lobster and sour cream dumplings had a rich and balanced flavor, but was plagued by its lukewarm service. The proscuitto wrapped heart of romaine lettuce caesar also had this problem... Just kidding. It just was not special. I did enjoy the fresh anchovies filets and the presence of fish in the dressing. It was not drenched in it either, which was nice in contrast to the saltiness of the cured pork.\n\nThere was no option for entree. I was excited because it boasted a cut of wagyu with truffled potatoes and asparagus. The plates were not hot so the food cooled by the time it hit the tables. The sides were cooked in pans and were piping hot. They were the best part of the meal and came in a generous portion for three. The steak itself did not taste like wagyu. It was on the tougher side and had no presence of marbling to it. At certain spots, it was dry. \n\nAs for desserts, they ran out of the intended offering and subbed out the peanut butter chocolate bar. It was light and I was thankful because this was the second steakhouse on my trek through Restaurant Week. \n\nMy friend saw that they offer a beef tasting menu for $120. I am intrigued by this. Just hope the quality will be better than the one set for this event.\n\nAnother aspect that dragged down our experience was the ambiance. It was all dark with shadows. Nothing popped or made for a great focal point in the restaurant. It all just blended together into a bland atmosphere."

The prices were decent, but the steak was definitely not as tender as CraftSteak. Too bad we ate at CraftSteak the day before, or we would have been more impressed. \n\nThe restaurant is very dark inside, yet very loud.

We ordered Vanilla Cheesecake for dessert, and it could have been richer, but I guess that's up to your personal preference. \n\nIt was also my first time trying bone marrow - it really didn't taste like anything. Maybe the pepper covering it overpowered the original taste, I just don't think it's worth it to pay almost $10 for the little bits I scraped off. \n\nI would probably not come again, considering how competitive fine dining is in Vegas, I would want to try something a little more outstanding."

We had been there previously several years ago and were very pleased.\n     This visit was immediately dampened by an unfriendly greeting from the hostess who marched us to a side alcove table away from the main dining room.  Because this area was a little dark they had a big screen video on the wall above our table, which created an unpleasant and garish atmosphere.  We said \"no way\" and she then showed us to a similarly dismal table for two near the bar with my view being a blank wall, again not in the main dining area.  We were not happy and her only response was \"We are bought out tonight and nothing else available\".  OK, what was my reservation all about?\n     After sitting there a moment  the waiter appeared and we said we were getting ready to leave.  He said he would check with the manager.  Within 5 minutes they had cleaned another nice table in the main dining area and we were moved.  All was well again.  I do think it is a lame excuse to say \"We are so busy tonight--so many convention reservations--blah, blah, blah\".  Hey, you are in the restaurant business; treat all of your customers as friends and guests to be successful.\n     The food was good with a very expensive wine list--3-4 times mark up as usual. It just seems if you are paying $300 for a dinner for two it should be a great experience."

We got the New York Strip for two, as did our friends. We ordered ours medium rare and they ordered theirs medium. Both came out cooked the same exact way. Food was ok, service was horrible. As much as these places charge, I expect great service. Our busboy was on top of it, but our waiter was non existent. He took our order and he checked on us once. Our water glasses went empty, my friend asked for a diet Coke that was forgotten about, we asked the busboy for the Coke and it came about 15 minutes later! I don't know if it was a staffing issue or what but it was not that busy so there is no reason for the bad service. The manager? Came around and asked how everything was, but we hadn't been there long enough to really gauge our experience at that point. We also decided mid meal we would like wine, and asked for a wine list which was never brought to us. Overall a very disappointing experience."

Once we found the place (which took a little search) we grabbed a couple seats at the bar.   The normal bartender was off taking care of something away from the bar.   The manger was there to give us drink menus and water.   No worries, we had to figure out what to have.   The bartender was back very quickly and we picked our drinks.   They were well made with high quality ingredients.   A very nice way to start the evening.   Good job.   \n\nWill I be back?  Yup, I'd like to try dinner there to go with the drinks!"

It is a nice quiet little restaurant tucked in the corner of the Four Seasons. \n\nThe restaurant was amazing. We did one of their preset menus, and I was glad we did. Everything was so amazing. The bib lettuce salad was the most amazing salad I've ever had in a restaurant. The lettuce actually tasted clean, compared to other restaurants where the lettuce tastes like dirt. The filet mignon was beyond amazing. So wonderfully seasoned and cooked to perfection. There were wine pairings with each course, and it was all you can drink! \n\nOur waiter was the absolute best as well! Unfortunately his name escapes me at the moment. My husband told him it was my birthday, and he brought me a huge slice of chocolate cake, along with the dessert that came with out meal. He also brought us a sorbet selection sampling. \n\nThe overall experience was amazing. I felt very attended to, and all of the staff was so polite and accommodating. I can't wait to go back!"

            "review": "I honestly think this is a middling four. It's not a three, but it's maybe a tiny bit weak for a four. \n\nDining with a family member, we split a couple appetizers: their caprese salad and the seared foie gras. The salad was outstanding. Nice, flavorful ripe heirloom tomato halves (not slices, but big meaty halves) paired with some decent mozzarella cheese (needed a little more salt to my taste) balsamic vinegar, and a very nice, slightly bitter, green and fennel root salad. I loved the large tomato chunks, and I'm a sucker for fennel in salad like this. Coupled with a night light dressing, this was a hit. The foie gras on the other hand...wasn't really up to the same standard. It's a nice sized helping of simple seared foie gras, but on top of a pineapple upside-down cake. Seriously. The cake and the liver really do nothing for one another. We each had a bit of the combination, and then just ate the cake, cleansed the palate, and set in on the foie gras. The liver itself was pretty rare, which I guess it OK with me. I think I'd just rather have this in pate rather than ad a whole piece of liver. I don't think we'd order this again. I would say I'm a little disappointed that they didn't have the traditional steak house soups. No lobster bisque? No french onion? Just a spring garlic soup, which yours truly is not ordering when the word garlic is in the name.\n\nFor main course, each of us had filets, medium rare, with a side of the royal trumpet mushrooms and the bleu cheese fondue. The steaks came out looking very dry - almost cold. Not sizzling, not glistening, nothing. It seemed odd, but they were definitely served on hot plates, weren't cold, and tasted pretty good. I think personally, a little more salt and pepper crust would have been good, but they had good beef flavor and were very tender. I liked the mushrooms as a hearty compliment - very meaty, large mushrooms in a nice brown gravy. And the bleu cheese fondue was very good - mild and creamy, great with the filet. I usually don't get sauces with steaks, wanting them to be able to stand on their own, but this was nice to have. Maybe I'll do it more often.\n\nFinally, we opted to skip dessert. Kinda. First there were complimentary little ice cream cookie sandwiches. Which were good. And then, since I had mentioned it was someone's birthday, was a complimentary butterscotch creme brulee, which was quite nice of them. This was actually very good. I wouldn't probably have ordered it myself, but it had great rich butterscotch flavor, silky smooth texture, and a nice burnt (but not too burnt) sugar crust. Very well executed. So I guess we got dessert anyway.\n\nFinal note - their iced tea is some kind of...mango or fruit flavored tea. It doesn't say this, and they didn't say it, and we didn't ask for it. But it definitely is flavored. Some people like this, some people do not. We...tend not to. That fruit flavor gets really floral in tea. Just be warned if that's not your thing. I'm surprised they didn't say anything or call out that it wasn't standard iced black tea.\n\nSo do I come back? Wellll...no. Four stars, right? That's good? But in Vegas, my bar is so high, and there are so many other steakhouses and other great restaurants, that if I had to make the choice, I would opt to try something new or duplicate at another spot. This was pretty good, but not good enough to make me want to come back right away at the expense of other spots. But I think it's better than Foundation Room (in the same hotel) if you're looking for a traditional steak."

This place by far was probably my least favorite out of all that I have been to so far. \n\nI ordered the surf and turf. The lobster was ok. But the filet mignon was completely dry. I had even asked for them to cook it medium, and the meat was no where near pink inside nor was it tender or juicy; it was pretty much well done. \n\nThe only thing I would say that I did enjoy here was the mashed potatoes and the bruseel sprouts as the sides. But I mean you can never go wrong with adding truffle oil into mashed potatoes, it makes everything 10x better. \n\nThis place received three stars because the service was excellent, wish I can say the same about their food."

Paired with Atea Evodia Spain 2010\n\nSides: Parmesan potato gratin and white clamshell mushrooms\n\nDessert: Chocolate peanut butter bar with dulce de leche ice cream and chocolate sauce.\n\nOverall food and service was first class. The male sommelier was very generous with his several pours of wine per course. I really enjoyed the red Evodia Garnacha from Spain which was rich yet smooth and paired excellent with the rib eye. The waiter and his staff were also incredible and the dinning experience at Charlie Palmer was memorable. \n\nI would definitely recommend Charlie Palmer Steak."

My husband and I were staying at the Four Seasons for our first anniversary and had dinner reservations here. After reading other Yelp reviews, I had high hopes for a wonderful evening. Our waiter brought our menus and I asked about the Cut of the Week. He proceeded to tell me it was a lesser cut of meat and didn't recommend it. So we ordered lobster bisque soup, a bone in rib eye to share, twice baked potato, brussel sprouts and a glass of wine. The soup didn't arrive but our steak came out quickly followed by the potato and veggies. Steak was cooked properly at medium rare but the inside of the potato was COLD! Brussel sprouts were tasty. The problem could have been easily rectified if our server ever came to check on us. We decided to start eating so the steak wouldn't get cold. Finished the steak, didn't eat the cold potato. Finally waved down a bus boy who brought our server over. We told him we didn't get the soup and the wine never came. He asked if we wanted them now and we said we did not. As we're talking to him, the wine finally arrives. I've had more attentive service at the Sizzler. Even though this restaurant is located inside Four Seasons, it is not owned by Four Seasons and may explain the lack of customer care. No manager came by to speak to us about our experience before we left. So sad because Four Seasons is my go-to hotel but I won't risk ruining another special evening by coming back here. One star for the bus boy who made sure our water glasses were always full."

We went for the steakhouse classics: Shrimp Cocktail, Caesar Salad, Steak and Potato. Such a straightforward menu, executed to absolute perfection. The shrimp were wild Baja prawns that were big (not too big) and delicious. The Caesar salad was so snappy, crisp, with creamy dressing (not too much) and garlicky. The filet was simply seasoned and cooked perfectly. I opted for the Au Gratin and my wife got the mashed - not sure which was better. I loved my Au Gratin - which were broiled on top to provide a little crunch. I also got a bleu cheese sauce on the side that was to die for. The wine list had a good variety of big and small wines. I am fully aware that I sound as if I work at the restaurant, but I don't. I simply wanted to give props where props are due. I am a businessman and I have to go out to a lot of dinners over the course of the year. I can safely say that this was one of the best meals I've ever had. I think there is something to be said for a place that has perfected the standards, the classics, and this is one of them. Cheers to the Charlie Palmer Steak House. Please, please, please keep up the great work. We shall see each other soon enough...and I can't wait."

The food is delicious and they are always switching up the menu items and keeping it fresh. This is sometimes a negative because last year's salmon over lobster risotto was an absolute to die for dish. Dishes like filet mignon are a mainstay. This year's Ritz cracker stuffed 2 lbs lobster took the winning medal. It was so filling that my husband barely ate any of the sides we ordered (lobster fried rice, saut\u00e9ed spinach, and au gratin potatoes).\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary last night and they had champagne for us. We figured that was \"the treat\" as we know from previous years they always do something special like a dessert. This year they topped it and then some. After being deliciously stuffed to the brim with our meal we decided to forego dessert, but I still had to have my coffee (opted for the latte). Well, next thing we knew our server brought us cheesecake (I don't know flavor, but delic!) and two chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches. Unbelievable. They truly made our night special.\n\nWe will absolutely be back every time we are in Vegas. \n\nThe restaurant may not have views of the Bellagio fountains or overlook the Vegas strip, but it is an absolute hidden gem in Four Season's Hotel @ The Mandalay Bay."

We had a private room to accommodate our party.  The menu was a set 3 course meal with 2 choices for each course (The Michael Jackson Tribute Menu).  They actually printed new menus with my brother and SIL names which was a really nice touch.\n\nSo for $50 I got a three course meal consisting of roasted tomato soup , a bone in filet and carrot cake, with bottomless wine pairings for the first two courses.  Before I start on the dinner, I just want to mention the bread basket had some of the best cornbread.  Now for the dinner.  The tomato soup was tasty with 2 crispy wontons with mascarpone cheese and served at the table.  I've never heard of a bone in filet, but it was tender & perfectly cooked medium rare.  I usually like a fattier cut like a rib eye, but the filet was the best I've had.  I suspect it was the bone.  The carrot cake was moist and the serving size for the desserts was huge.  I don't think anyone could finish their dessert.\n\nService was impeccable and they also accommodated 2 children under 5.\n\nFor $50, this has got to be the best deal of any high end steakhouse in Vegas. The bone-in filet would be $50 at most places ala carte, so I'm not sure how they throw in a first course, dessert and bottomless wine pairing at this price, but I won't complain."

Sweet, clean beef flavor  and it literally melts in your mouth.  Think otoro tuna.  The wet aged USDA Prime charcoal grilled filet is excellent.  Extremely high heat charcoal creates the perfect crust.  The charcoal imparts a good smoky bitterness that elevates the sweetness of the usually boring cut.  Finally the 28 day dry aged porterhouse.  Well trimmed with a more mild umame finish.  Nutty but not much bleu cheese flavor.\n\nSides are steakhouse standard but the standout remains the twice baked truffle potato.  Seriously good eats that adds a deem earthy flavor and richness to any steak.  Why more steakhouses don't make twice baked potato is beyond me.\n\nNot calorie counting and wanting to splurge?  Add seared foie or bone marrow to any steak and put it over the top.\n\nTip:  Do check out their prefix menus which include bottomless pour wine pairings.\n\nExcellent wine list with many smaller, hard to get producers.

Ends up costing a little over $60/person.\nThe restaurant is located steps away from the hotel lobby, so unlike many other hotel/casinos, you don't have to walk for miles to reach the restaurant.\nService was exceptional. Would return next visit if we visit Vegas again."

So 6 of us made a reservation. The service was awful for a fine dining experience. Our waiter (who had a waxed mustache) was rude and had no experience waiting tables. He would be gone for 10 minutes at a time and took awhile to bring out our requests. Bus boys also took awhile to clear plates and glasses. Very frustrating!!  Food?  Steaks for tough and didn't have much flavor. Would never go again or recommend to anyone. The ma\u00eetre de and hostess were talking together the whole time and not watching what was going on in their restaurant. Very poor experience!!!"

Charlie Palmer's RW menu is pretty limited and the only portion of the meal that you can choose different options was the appetizer.\n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras Terrine (regular menu):\nNutella, raspberry spaghetti, black mission figs and Texas toast. The terrine was perfectly smooth and creamy which is why it worked so well with the Nutella.  The warm Texas toast just makes the terrine smoother and creamier.  The raspberry spaghetti lacked flavor - it added color to the plate and that's about it. The figs added texture. 4/5 \n\nAustralian Kobe Beef Carpaccio:\nCame with truffle salad. The salad would've been great had it not been extra salty.  The carpaccio itself was excellent...the salad ruined it! 3/5\n\nCharred Bone-In FIlet Mignon:\nCame with bone marrow flan and Port Wine reduction.  The bone marrow flan was good. We always gets our steaks cooked medium-rare...we got rare and the thing was still mooing. I'll eat a steak as long as it's not a hockey puck but if you're a steak place shouldn't you be able to cook medium-rare? 3/5\n\nJalape\u00f1o Creamed Corn and Parmesan Potato Gratin:\nThese sides were really good. The creamed corn wasn't spicy at all for having jalape\u00f1o. The gratin was delis and the melted parmesan on top was great. 4/5\n\nChocolate Peanut Butter Bar:\nServed with caramel ice cream, and chocolate sauce. I don't like peanut butter and chocolate together but that's just a matter of personal preference. The ice cream was good and I finished it then gave the friend the half of my peanut butter.  I mean, the peanut butter wasn't too bad since it wasn't really that pronounced - I was just not in love with it to finish it. 3/5\n\nThe night we went, there was an event (some business mixer) and no hostess was there so we were quite confused. The service was quite bad. I asked first server that came to our table for the RW menu and he said he'd get it but he never came back. We were waiting for somebody to come to our table again but that took 20 minutes! Second server came to our table asking us, \"are you guys ready to order?\" uh...it's quite difficult to place an order if we don't know what's on the menu! My patience left and ate somewhere else."

While CPS is in a few other cities in America, it feels like a one of a kind, that listens to their base clientele.  going for loyalty, rather than assumed market demands for something else. Chef Steve is super talented, the Soms, the server, and full staff are a flawless orchestration of what needs to come back to Vegas. It is located in the Four Seasons, and somewhat hidden, it is a gem that sparkles once found. The lighting is perfect, romantic even, and sets the tone. I don't even feel like I am in Las Vegas when I'm there. I feel like I am in a true resort, somewhere on the coast of California.  This place hasn't lasted 16 years just because they have steak.  They have the BEST steaks in all of Vegas and Charlie Palmer keeps to his roots and identity as a chef, and my dining experience reflects that. Our server stated he had been there 16 years and looked as happy and proud of his work. Please go!!!! You will feel like a VIP and the only table in the house, they treat you well! Better than most of the new places in Las Vegas.  Thank You Charlie Palmer. To many more great steak nights at the Four Seasons!!!"

We started off with several cold seafood platters and some sweet and sour calamari. Along with the apps we ordered a first for me double magnum bottle of wine. This thing was huge but we managed to polish it off by the end of our meal. The apps were all tasty and fresh and I especially enjoyed the heat in the calamari. \n\nFor my main, I got the bone in ribeye steak with sweet onion.

Unfortunately the food quality and service have now been surpassed by many local steakhouses in town. I always have found the women at the front desk cold and unwelcoming but I have always looked past that because of the great food and service. Clearly we were not a priority on this visit. We were stuffed into a corner in the back of the dining room where we were motley forgotten about. Our servers style was that of a sports coach shouting at a team. The ordering of drinks was quite delayed and took a long time between each order. Food arrived about an hour after ordering. Salads and soups were mediocre in flavor and presentation. Steak quality was very chewy and undercooked compared to our past experiences. Sides were soupy and overcooked. The new sommelier was no help in choosing wine as he was too pre-osccupied and also had lost his voice. I miss the former sommelier who was excellent. The server kept doing drive by check-ins and kept forgetting what we asked for throughout the evening. Just not acceptable overall experience for the Four Seasons in my opinion.  Fortunately we are discovering other fantastic steak houses in town with much better food and great service for less money. We are loving Barrymore's, Twin Creeks Happy Hour, Flemings and Silverado Steakhouse!!"

As soon as you walk in the restaurant is just a few short steps away.\n\nThis time we started at their bar so we could finish watching the baseball game. Tommy the bartender took great care of us as we ordered an appetizer and drinks. He was very knowledgeable and even though they did not carry our first choice of beverage he was able to make a perfect suggestion that paired perfectly.\n\nAfter the game we moved to a table so we could have more privacy and catch up. I opted again for the Cut of the Week while my friend chose a prosciutto wrapped romaine salad and swordfish on a bed time of crab risotto. Once again the Cut of the Week menu did not disappoint. It started with an apple arugula salad with blue cheese. The main course was a fontina crusted pork porterhouse wish smashed taters and kale lollipops. Desert this time was a baked Alaska style banana split. Oh and we can't forget the bottomless wine pairing!"

Why cover up a perfectly cooked top quality piece of beef by covering it with gross sticky goo!! While my steak was great, I really had trouble getting past the brown sauce. It didn't taste good, and texturally it really bothered me to have liquids all over my steak.. for $42 I can find a tasty steak elsewhere.\n\nWe had some side dishes, but despite the fact that I sampled them just 15 hours ago I've already forgotten them all .. yawn.\n\nThere are so many delicious steak spots in Vegas, I can't say I'd ever return here, but for those that like their steaks covered in sauce this might be your spot.."

Every week, they have a new cut of meat.  I made the dinner reservations for a party of 5 about a  week in advance and on the night of the feast, I'm proud to say we were all blown away!  The ambiance was modern but with a twist.  Dim candle lit room for a romantic unforgettable moment type of vibe but well balanced with the dark wood for a touch of masculinity.  \n\nWe were sat promptly after checking in.  Every girl had a waiter to help pull out our chairs.  We were served bottled Fiji water and had deliciously warmed varieties of breads.  There were cornbread, sourdough, french, and wheat rolls.  I loved how when someone from  our table got up, a waiter would come and fetch our current table napkin and replace it completely with a brand new one.  No empty water or wine glass.  Every time it started to get low, there was an immediate refill.  They're so Ninja!  \n\nWe started of which their cheese platter.  It had 3 different types of cheese that I cannot remember but it was served with seedless sliced red grapes and bits of honey comb.  I loved the sweetness of the honey it played on the cheese.  It was accompanied by warm and fluffy brioche.  For our 3 course dinner, we started off with a watermelon salad.  It had a mild goat milk cheese and a balsamic dressing.  It was light and refreshing.  Our meat of the week was a grill New York steak.  It was cooked to perfection.  No one had any complaints about their steaks.  For the sides, it was served family styled.  We had grilled baby asparagus and oven roasted fingerling potatoes.  It was a satisfying meal.  On top of that, we had the most knowledgable and nice sommelier.  He was very generous with each and every pouring.  He also took the time to walk around the table to give us a breif description of each wine.  I think our table alone, help finished a couple of bottles.  For our last course, we had a chocolate covered hazelnut creme.  On the side, they threw in homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches for us.  I felt soo special that night.\n\nEverything about this place, from the food to the service and the decor has definitely surpassed my expections.  It's no wonder Charlie Palmer is who he is with soo many great accolades.  He deserves it and I'm just happy to have tried his food."

The food is what you would say, a \"good bang for your buck.\" It's quite surprising how good it is for only $49. However, there can be improvement in the service department - staff can be more attentive and less defensive/confrontational about diner's requests. More specifically, when asking to have our steak re-cooked (I asked for medium rare and my dish arrived with much more rare center than expected - it became difficult to cut through and there was quite a bit of bleeding), the server insisted that it was our fault for miscommunication of the cooking style. I did not appreciate having this argument at what seems to be a fine dining establishment, over a small issue of how to cook steak. My boyfriend's father cooks steaks on a daily basis at his restaurant; I think we know the different degrees of steak doneness. Nevertheless, the pricing for the food quality is enough for me to recommend this restaurant for others to check out."

The waiter was not the worst waiter ever,  he just didn't seem all that interested in our satisfaction, when one of the servers brought the wrong entree he had to check with the waiter who was standing about fifteen feet from our table,  without acknowledging error or apologizing he checked his computer screen and redirected the server.  My steak was not good and not terrible but at these prices it should be excellent or at least good. We asked for more bread and after a while had to ask again before it was delivered.   I could also see the waiter  \"marrying wine bottles\" at his station in the dinning room ,  not very classy,  (not to mention not legal in some places). The soup was very good.  Basically  just not the fine dinning one would expect from a place in this location with these prices. \nI expected to return for another try at this place but haven't had the time so let me say that after writing my review I was contacted by management and they were very interested in making things right.

After our meal, it was very clear Charlie Palmer didn't need to give choices. The menu they selected was near perfect, with each course satisfying your taste buds, with a little bit of everything.\n\nI'm not a soup person. I rarely order it anywhere. However, I had friends rave about their corn chowder, so we had to try it. My boyfriend and I rarely order the same thing, but boy am I glad I had my own bowl. It was poured table-side,nice and hot on top the grill rock shrimp and jalape\u00f1o bacon. As we watched it pour, my boyfriend both were anticipated it to be thick hearty and heavy, as most chowders are. Nope, it was light and bursting with flavor. As I devoured each spoonful, I got a different taste with each one, a slurp of chowder accompanied by that amazing shrimp, or a little salty and spice with that bacon. I can't believe I've written this whole paragraph about soup. It was that good.\n\nWhen I read that the entree will be Petite Medallions of Filet Mignon, I thought what many people might think, that it would be \"petite.\" I've eaten at enough steakhouses to understand the restaurant language of menus. I was pleasantly surprised to see the portion was very substantial, even for my boyfriend and his huge high-metabolism\nappetite. More importantly, it was cooked medium-rare to a tee. Incredibly tender, it melted in your mouth like a filet should. The lobster was juicy and buttery.\n\nOf the two sides, the star that took the show was the truffled potato gratin. It had lots of truffle flavor, creamy, and so comforting. A dish I would love someone to bring for every holiday meal and put on my table. The creamed spinach was good, nothing to complain about. My boyfriend isn't a fan, and I was too busy scraping the bottom of that potato gratin bowl.\n\nI've never had Foie Gras before. I declared that the next time I dined at a fancy restaurant, I'd order it. I think it's one of those dishes you definitely have to try more than once. It was decadent, rich, buttery, and fatty. I took small pieces and ate it with my filet. I can't say it was love at first sight, but I enjoyed it. The verdict is still out till the next time...\n\nLast but not least, the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar dessert. Served with almonds, dark chocolate sauce, and dulce de Leche ice cream, it was heaven. You ever have a plan when you look at your dessert and say to yourself, \"I'll just have a couple bites, because I can't possibly eat that whole thing...\" Well, that was my exact thought when I picked up my fork. Guess what? It's not what happened. Bite after bite, I loved the dessert even more. Even with the dark chocolate, which I usually think is too rich and bitter for me, as I took a little bit of ice cream, a little piece of the peanut butter bar, and maybe an almond, my tummy was seriously just doing the happy dance. My boyfriend finished his dessert and pointed out the complimentary miniature ice cream sandwiches they gave in addition to our bars. He said they were great. I had a bite, but I was still in a haze, completely captive and enjoying a very intimate moment with my peanut butter dessert.\n\nThe service - this is something I really don't need to mention, because it was what anyone would walk in expecting at a place like this. The water was always filled, the courses came out with precision timing, the crumbs were cleared off the tablecloth, every empty dish or plate was cleared away within seconds. Our servers were friendly, smiling, helpful, and of course, amazingly attentive. As we settled our check, we told them how much we enjoyed our dinner there, and they expressed their gratitude and welcomed us back. We were happy to hear that Charlie Palmer almost always participates for Las Vegas Restaurant Week.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I patted myself on the back for choosing Charlie Palmer as my last dinner for this fall's Restaurant Week. It'll be on the list of restaurants to consider for future special occasions.\nDefinitely."

The service is top tier ad the food is amazing.\n\nI judge a business by how they treat their customers and I can attest that CP values the patrons that walk through their doors. I've been here several times with my girlfriend, and we have always had a pleasant time, with the exception of one off night. I sent a nicely written email to their customer service explaining that the night seemed off in a way and let them know that I would still be coming back regardless. The way they handled that email sets this company apart from so many others.\n\nThe assistant GM got into contact with me and went above and beyond anything I imagined. Adam's actions on behalf of the company all but assured that CP will have a very long time customer in myself.\n\nThe food is better than N9NE and the staff is knowledgeable and attentive. If you get a chance to check out Charlie Palmer Steak in Four Seasons, do yourself a favor and go.\n\nIf you are budget conscious, they have the Michael Jackson Prix Fixe menu with unlimited wine pairing for $49.00 per person or the Cut of the Week with unlimited wine pairing for $48.00 per person. Last weeks cut was a deliciously prepared t-bone, cooked to perfection. I could go spend more than that on alcohol alone anywhere else.\n\nThis is a great date night spot or a place to get together with friends for delicious food and conversation, but don't take my word for it. Check it out yourself! (anyone catch the Reading Rainbow reference?)"

The steaks were really good, they cook it exactly how you want it. As for the source, you will have to pay extra for an exchange. That's no big deal because the waiters are going to make you feel like kings and queens there. At least that's how I felt.\nWe ordered the iced shellfish plate, which taste amazing, but I felt cheated in some ways. Maybe it was my misunderstanding of the menu. It says \"$ 35 (Minimum 2)\". I thought it means at least feeds 2 people, but it came out you have to at least order 2, that makes it $70. While would someone put a price for 1 when you must to order 2?"

Charlie Palmer Steak (located @ Four Seasons hotel - next to Mandalay Bay) offers a special menu that you have to know about to ask for called \"Cut of the Week\".  COTW is a prix fixe menu paired with 2 Bottomless wines, 1 white & 1 red for $48 served Tues-Sat weekly.  There is always a red meat in the COTW, which could be various cuts/preparations of steak, lamb, veal.  Also includes a salad, 2 family style sides, & dessert.\n\nI didn't understand the whole \"bottomless wine\" part until I finally enjoyed COTW.  The service is absolutely fantastic.  Both of my wine glasses never emptied.  There were at least 2 servers dedicated to just keeping an eye on everyone's wine glasses who quickly topped my glass off every time I had taken more than 2 sips.  I didn't even realize how much I had drank until we were walking out because my glass was always full.  Can you say tipsayyyyy??  I slipped as I was stepping on the escalator and cut my arm.  Seriously, only Me!  Yes, I already had a driver for the night because of the words on the menu \"Bottomless wine\".\n\nYou really can't beat the outstanding food and service quality for under $96 for two people before tip.\n\nOn our first ever visit to CPS we had a slight service mishap, which they more than made up for.  Approx a month prior we had booked reservations for an April Friday evening because close friends from out of town were visiting us.  When we arrived we were informed that a group had reserved the entire restaurant for a party and they could no longer honor our reservations.  We were clearly disappointed because no one had taken the time to call us before we got dressed up and drove over with dreams of beefy goodness that can only be derived from Charlie Palmer.  However, they walked us into their sister restaurant in Mandalay Bay, Aureole and told the hostess to comp all of our food because they could not honor our CPS dinner reservations.  Furthermore, they told us that they would take care of our first round of drinks upon our next visit to CPS.  They really did.  They also know us by name and face on every return visit since the mishap on our initial visit.\n\nMy only minor complaint is that over the past 2 months they stopped offering different wines on the COTW.  Of late they offer the same 2 wines every week: 2009 Chateau Montfort Vouray Demi Sec from Loire Valley & 2008 Universo de Los Andes Malbec from Argentina.  I REALLY  REALLY hope that CPS goes back to varying the COTW wines on a weekly basis."

I have had great vacations at several of their properties. I have never understood why the Las Vegas Four Seasons has continued to maintain its asscoiation with the Charlie Palmer Restaurant... they aren't in the same league.\n\nMy latest foray was at Thanksgiving. When I learned that my parents made a booking at Charlie Palmers for Thanksgiving diner... I was disappointed. In the past I had several dinners there but was never impressed. About five or six years ago, prior to turning vegan, we had a Thanksgiving diner there and I remembered it as being extremely mediocre... I hadn't been back since. \n\nWe had a booking for about twelve people. I called the restaurant two days prior to let them know about my families food restrictions... myself, my wife and my two daughters (10 &12 years old) are vegan. At first they said there was no way they could accommodate us and suggested we book somewhere else. Then when the Manager noticed that we would be canceling a group of twelve, she said she would check with the chef to see what he could do. She called back and said they the kitchen could offer us a choice of pasta with vegetables or a risotto for our main courses. I ordered the risotto for my wife and I, and the pasta with vegetables for my daughters.\n\nAfter arriving for dinner... we ended up skipping the first course as their was no vegan option, then we were served a very plain salad. When our main courses arrived we all looked at each other with deep concern. What was presented did not look appealing. Well we all took a few bites... our risotto was flavorless mush... my daughters pasta hardly had any vegetables and was also flavorless. I thought they'd be the easy ones to please... they love pasta.\n\nThe food that was served was appalling... I have no idea how a chef in a first class restaurant would ever let such poor food leave their kitchen. \n\nNeedless to say we walked out... we were all starving... so it was off to Yard House down the street. \n\nI eat out at numerous upscale restaurants and rarely do I have a problem getting a vegan meal. In fact Steakhouses often provide me with the best options.\n\nI do not understand how a supposedely first class restaurant can make a commitment to provide a restricted meal, on Thanksgiving, and then make as little effort as possible to deliver a decent product.\n\nClearly there were red flags going up when I called ahead to make arrangements for our food restrictions... my mistake to not take heed."

The Four Seasons is easy to access since it isn't in the middle of the Strip and all of the traffic. We were immediately greeted by a valet and told that the $24 valet fee would be waived since we were dining at the hotel. The restaurant is a very short walk from the front door. I liked that I didn't have to walk through a casino to access this restaurant.\n\nThe host at the front warmly greeted us as soon as he seated the party in front of us. He provided us Restaurant Week menus as well as the regular menu. The regular menu looked great for a future visit, but we were set on RW for this visit.\n\nThe service was excellent from start to finish. Our waiter was professional and timely. We were checked on regularly, drinks refilled constantly, and all courses were presented with an explanation of what we were being served. The service definitely met if not exceeded the level of service one expects at a steakhouse.\n\nThe bread basket that is brought out before the courses was great. There was a nice olive bread, cornbread, and a regular crusty bread. All of the breads were delicious. The Bibb Lettuce Salad was simple with some bacon and ranch, but was good. The RW menu also included bottomless wine. We were served white with the salad and red with the main course. The red was on the dry side and was my favorite of the two.\n\nThe Surf & Turf was very, very good. The steak was prepared perfectly with a well seasoned char on the outside and tender meat inside. The stuffed lobster had nice pieces of lobster and crab with a tasty stuffing. The jalapeno creamed corn was very tasty and the jalapeno didn't overwhelm the other flavors. The smashed potatoes were good, but not the most exciting side this restaurant offers. The finale to the meal came in the form of a Lemon Tart. I liked the crust and tart tasting lemon filling, but the meringue was my favorite part."

No more follow-up, no are you okay, can we get you something, can we dry clean your shirt and pants, how about a free cognac for dessert, nope towels and soda water. So, I don't know. I loved the food, thought something was lacking. By the way, quick mention, CP is a long walk when coming through the Madalay Bay located in the bottom of the Four Seasons. Not prime location, but the food is so good and the atmosphere (loved the funky furry seats I was in) is great. Save for the wine bath which no one seemed to care about...love the food, always will. They have my heart sons of bitches."

            "review": "First off, I'm not normally one to complain...I was a server myself before and know how hard it is to put on a \"perfect\" evening for a large group.  There is no such thing as perfect, nor do I remotely expect it.  What we experienced at Charlie Palmer Steak at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas however, can only be described as pathetic and insulting.\n\nWe were there for a Valentines Day wedding party dinner with 27 people, with the bride and groom paying for dinner including a wine/beer/cocktails package for everyone.  We were told there was to be an open bar for 3 hours.  For starters, the wedding couple was surprised to find that the setup they were expecting (a standing/mingling area for drinks/appetizers and a separate sit down table for dinner) was not provided.  Rather there was simply a cramped back room stuffed with a table for 27.  Oh well, moving on.\n\nIMO from the appetizers to desert, the staff showed their incredible lack of competence, care and integrity.  Appetizers that never made it down to our side of the table because they didn't distribute them properly (big plates, hard to pass around).  Drink orders (at least 4 requests by my wife and I, and a few from others around us) that went ignored.  Whatever, we took it in stride as we didn't want to complain with the wedding party there - and they did bring wine out a few times during appetizers and the main course.  Small pours however.\n\nFrom there on however, more waiters disappearing without bringing our drink orders.  \nNot responding to our requests for wine.  Making excuses like, \"We're busy preparing the cake, we don't have time to serve wine\".  What? With all the servers there, you don't have one guy that can pour wine (after you've ignored our requests and empty glasses for the last 30 minutes)?  I was dumbfounded at the response.  \n\nFinally the guy came back around to pour wine...but by the time he made it to my wife and I, he had little left.  He poured about 2 ounces in my glass and then unbelievably poured literally a FEW DRIPS into my wife's glass and then walked off.  NEVER TO RETURN.  From there on, I asked at least 3 times for wine only to have them tell me they'd bring it...when they never did...then ultimately \"sorry, no more wine, serving time is over\".  What?? \n\nIt gets better.  Then they start serving the cake...only to apparently run out before serving at least 4 guests.  Again, my wife and I...and the Groom's own Mother!  As they are serving coffee and picking up finished cake plates from people right across from us...it wasn't remotely apparent to them that they left many people unserved for cake and coffee.  I didn't say anything because I was just too disgusted/dumbfounded at that point.  At that point I was just sitting back, watching the carnage unfold.  \n\nFinally, another 30 minutes later when we're getting ready to leave (about 9:45pm), the waiter comes over with a bottle of wine and offers me a glass!  What??  After all that, you now offer it??  I promptly told him, no thanks, no longer interested.  I had literally \"lost my appetite\".\n\nIn the end, I feel like these guys took attention away from what should have been a more enjoyable wedding dinner party.  IMO, they RIPPED OFF our friends who paid $250 PER HEAD to have an open bar, wine and beer service.  IMO, they added insult to injury with the way they handled things.  This was literally the worst \"fine dining\" server experience I have ever had and I feel inclined to share this.  I will never step foot in another Charlie Palmer Steak house.  These guys were absolutely terrible.  I strongly urge you to reconsider hosting any dinner parties at this establishment."

The waiter made a subtle hint at tipping by  stating his helper and he work \"as a team.\"  I didn't appreciate that.  \nAll items on menu are al a carte - not an issue.\nThe salad was good, as was the freshly baked  bread(s).\nMy guest &amp; I both ordered the rib eye steak - med. rare.  Sides were yukon gold potato puree, and grilled onions with wild mushrooms.\nThe steaks and the sides arrived at the table lukewarm - and I like my food HOT.  The steaks were about 30% fat.  I mentioned both the  temperature and the fat to the waiter.  He tried to convince me the fat content was normal.  To be fair, he did offer to have another steak cooked for me - I declined.  I know wild mushrooms are supposed to have an \"earthy\" taste - but not supposed to have actual earth in them.  They were gritty.\nThe dinner ended up costing $200. without drinks or wine.\nI can duplicate the menu at home for a quarter of the cost and it would be far superior.  \nThe cook should have a serious talk with his kitchen staff and wait staff on getting food to the table hot and without dirt in it.\nI do not recommend this to anyone who has a good idea of decent \"steak restaurant\" food."

The staff present were more interested in polishing glasses and cleaning than making sure we were taken care of.

I  actually felt that i was in a Game of Thrones episode and the waiter was one of the faceless men. Does the waiter have a name? i guess not!\n\nIn any event, we  proceeded to order our meal from the faceless brethren, i ordered a NY strip, medium and my wife an 8oz filet. To my horror, my strip steak came out covered in cloves of sauteed garlic! Not what i requested, or would ever do to a prime cut of beef. \nThe faceless waiter said he could scrap the garlic off and \"re-fire\" the steak. Are you kidding me? At $58 they should have replaced the steak. So they re-fired the steak, which I had to politely return once again, as it was so chewy and was almost impossible to cut without rocking the table. Perhaps i should have ordered the oysters, clams and cockles? \n\nIt was at this time, I was approached by a faceless manger. Does the manager have a name? Nope! How can the lack of social graces in what is supposed to be a high end establishment be so prevalent? I mean you don't have to know my name but please introduce yourself and make a party feel welcome.\n\nTo their credit, they did eventually replace the steak, and got me a beer for my inconvenience. \n\nDoes this restaurant have a name? Yes, Overrated!\n\nP.S. they had a three piece band playing jazz that was Awesome."

Their website advertised \"best steakhouse...\" And they had such great Yelp reviews we thought we'd check it out. Here's what I expect when dining at a finer establishment 1) to be seated promptly at my reservation time 2) for the waiter to be polite and engaging 3) the food to be great enough that I want to return.\nMy husband ordered the spinach salad and I ordered the Bibb salad and we ordered the porterhouse for 2 that comes with truffled potatoes. The porterhouse comes with a $105 dollar price tag but since we wanted good steak that was fine. \nBoth salads came out and both were underwhelming. My husbands spinach salad was ok but the dressing was overpowering even though they drizzle it in for you at the table. My Bibb salad was the opposite. It was supposed to come with bacon, my salad had 3 tiny scraps of it. The dressing was bland and the salad wasn't cold just more like room temperature. Bibb lettuce is best served cold to retain crispness. \nWe ordered our steak medium as per the waiters recommendation. We wanted it slightly pink in the center. What we got was well done around the edges and rare in the middle and it wasn't good. It's a big portion but it just wasn't good. It had no flavor, it wasn't juicy and it was just bad. The potatoes were alright but again the flavors were very overwhelming instead of subtle. \nI have no idea why this steak house gets such great reviews. In my book the one thing that should have been delicious was a disaster. There was nothing good about the meal and the service was ok."

I had no intention of eating here, but I was starving and a few people said Charlie Palmer's was a great spot. I gave it a chance and I'm very happy I did. First of all, they had some insane deal where you get three courses and unlimited wine pairings for $50. I was sitting at the bar and the bartender said to give it a try because the veal chop it came with was the best... he wasn't wrong. The first course was a salad which was quite good, the second course was the veal chop with roasted vegetables and some type of potato. The veal chop was amazing and the roasted vegetables were the perfect match, I didn't eat the potato, but they sure looked good. I decided to forgo dessert so they happily substituted a cappuccino. The bartender I had was awesome, and he wasn't kidding about the unlimited wine... the bar scene was very lively so I hung out for a while and probably went through a bottle myself (he continued to pour for free even after my meal had ended). I feel like if this place was more centrally located on the strip it would be a gold mine. I would love to go back and give a steak a try, but I have a hard time believing it wouldn't be very, very good. If you find yourself in the Four Seasons, near it, or anywhere in Vegas absolutely try Charlie Palmers."

They were all great and a hit. I really enjoyed the Tomato Caprese salad, as the mozzarella cheese was truly fresh and tasteful.  I ordered the filet Mignon and it was perfect other than the fact the meal arrived on a cooler side, again I attributed it to the large party and crowded restaurant . But when my coffee arrived lukewarm, I was not very pleased as it seems that a restaurant of this status should pay more attention to he service, the meal is great if served properly.

It took very long to get the waiter to come over once we had been seated.  The waiter, although apologetic about the delay was not really very informative about the menu, acting pretty much as a note taker as we told him what we wanted.  After the meal nobody took our dishes away for enough time that we needed to flag down another table's waiter to get it done for us.  He was NOT very happy about it, and made a LOT of noise with our dishes as he cleared the table.  (Perhaps a small hissy fit)?\nSteak was very good, potato au gratin may have been  Stouffers frozen.  \nThe Sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable and helped pick a great wine that was very reasonably priced for the quality.  A bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming and average dining experience.  If it was Outback Steakhouse then OK, but not for Charlie Palmer's.   Will not return, too many other great choices on the Strip for a steak."

Little foot traffic is always good for convenience though! \n\nI had the Bibb Salad. Filet Mignon, sides galore, and Hazelnut Bar. \n\nThe salad was tasty. Again, clean simple flavors. Appropriate portion. \nThe Filet was good. It was cooked very well. I wouldn't say it was the best steak I ever had but the sides made up for that. \nOf the sides we got I recommend the mushrooms, whipped potato or au gratin (BOTH Great), and haricot verts! \nTo end the night, I had the hazelnut bar with was delicious.

I can't help but wonder whether all their steaks are the same quality as what I had, or how much more better their regular steaks may be... But maybe I shouldn't be complaining for the price I paid.

A friend who went the night before warned us not too go and told us that steak was way too salty and a bit dry and dessert was way too sweet. I thought I would still give it a shot since there are many other great reviews. However, she was absolutely right about this place. I hated my steak and dessert. Soup and salad was the only two things I could eat. Service was just okay.\n\nI would not recommend anyone to come for their restaurant week menu. Even though this is supposed to be for charity but the food just was too horrible."

In a city that has some of the best food in the world, Chalie stands out.\n\nI had the surf and turf which gave me some of the best filet mignion and lobster I have ever had in my life. Yes it's very pricey. It's pricier than a lot of the other steakhouses on the strip but it is more classic and less trendy.\n\nOne thing, please please please do not get drunk and rowdy here. It's not the place. There was a very loud bachelor party next to us and definitely disturbed my quiet birthday meal. I mean I'm paying 100 bucks a plate, can you please not yell \"Fucking twat\" in the restaurant?\n\nThe servers were amazing though and apologized profusely. I understand, they were probably making a fortune off those douchebags. At least I got a free dessert and drink out of it."

It also look like my grandmother was the head interior designer.  I've seen better design aesthetics in a Wichita Hometown Buffet.  \n\nDry and Wet aged steaks sounded amazing so we were excited.  When I asked if they were aged in house and found out no, they're aged \"somewhere in Arizona\" I got a little weary of the $70 Porterhouse and even more weary of the $40/oz Kobe (4 oz minimum and they help you with the math).  The steak was fine otherwise, just fine.  Save your $ for David Burke or a real steak house where they age in house.\n\nEvery single other item we had was 1 star.  \n\nFois Gras Terrine - I guess I missed the terrine part but to me you don't advertise Hudson Valley Fois Gras and then put a cold hot dog on the table.  Expected a nice piece of seared Fois.  Poor presentation, gross in general.\n\nAsparagus Almondine - flavorless logs of cold green mush.\n\nAu Gratin potatoes - Rather have Betty Crocker boxed from my mom in 1989. \n\nBone Marrow - cold gelatinous fat \n\nThis place is clearly accustomed to serving Bubba and Janet Johnston from Columbus Ohio who have never even heard of Wagyu let alone seen it on a menu.  The service was poor (we saw our server once during our meal, I couldn't even find him to complain about the Oscar Meyer Wiener Terrine so we just choked it down instead). Although I will say that in general, I have rarely been blown away by the food in Vegas.  I think the attitude on the strip is, \"these people are on vacation from the mid west and don't know a thing about food or service so lets give them mediocre food and overcharge them\".\n\nI rarely write reviews, this place was just comically overpriced and sadly underwhelming.  Choke job Charlie P!  I expect more for $225/person I guess, but that's just me."

            "review": "*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week menu ***\n\n\nFirst the food:\n\nThe bread basket was brought a fair amount of time after I ordered.  I was told there was honey wheat, ciabatta, white, something else, and their homemade corn bread. As you can see from the photo, the basket was mostly corn bread which was good, but another piece of bread was just plain.\n\nFor the first course,  I ordered the potato leek soup with lobster, sour cream dumplings, and jalape\u00f1o bacon crumbles.  The dish was presented as a bowl with the lobster, dumplings, and bacon in the bowl and then the soup was poured from a server onto the ingredients listed.  I was asked if I wanted some freshly ground pepper.  When I said yes, the server began a hunt to find a pepper grinder.  Evidently they had been put away from the day before and hadn't been brought back out.  The soup wasn't very hot.  The dumplings were the best part of the soup.  I also liked the bacon.  As you chewed it, the jalape\u00f1o flavor was released and left a little heat in your mouth for the next spoon of soup.\n\nThere was no choice for the main course.  It was Australian Waygu strip steak with a bone marrow flan and some wine reduction.  I ordered my steak black and blue.  It came out medium rare.  The steak looked a bit like a rectangular hockey puck and it cut about the same.  Inside, it was tender, but the outside was damn tough.  The flavor of the steak was nothing that I'd remember past the immediate bite I was consuming.  It was bland, also.\n\nCourse 3 consisted of two sides--asparagus and truffled pave potatoes.  The potatoes were absolutely the blandest thing I could eat.  I ate the truffle pieces that were on the top and enjoyed that the most.  Pave potatoes is their slang for fancy, stacked, thinly cut potato slices with no flavor.  The asparagus was OK.  It was crisp and better than being cooked until it's soft and mushy.  \n\nFor dessert, you had a choice of cheesecake or cheesecake.  The menu was different from their Restaurant Week menu online.  The mascarpone cheesecake on carrot coulis had some sorbet and pineapple pieces.  It was good.  It was not the chocolate peanut butter bar I was hoping to order.\n\nThe service:\n\nI was stunned by the lackadaisical manner of the staff that served me last night.  I saw my waiter twice, when I ordered and when he brought the bill.  I saw the person who delivered bread and non alcohol drinks 3 times, once with the bread and twice for iced tea.  I saw a bus person three times when he came to remove dishes.  \n\nThe score for my pink wrapper test was 50/50.  One test was a fail and one was a pass.  No one came by to ask how the meal was.  I waited a long time before the liquid person came to ask if I wanted some more iced tea.  In short, people just didn't seem to care.  I had more conversation and rapport with the young woman seated at the table next to me than I did the staff.\n\nWhen my server brought the bill, I asked him to do me a favor.  I asked him to tell the chef that medium rare was not black and blue.  He hesitated for a few seconds as if things didn't connect and then said, \"Oh, it was cooked too much?\"  He left the table and never said another word.  It was then that I started to fill out the comment card, something I rarely do.  When the server came back with my credit card slips, he curiously removed the salt and pepper shakers from the table.  Did it look like I was going to slip them into my pocket?\n\nAs for the ambience of the place, it was nouveau dark as this photo shows:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charlie-palmer-steak-las-vegas-3#ZR8UVgbVry2CagHkQEp4lA\n\nFor some reason, after I was there for about 15 minutes, the lights came up half bright for about two minutes and then went back down to this level.  Cozy, romantic, and very dark are all appropriate words.  What really got me the most was looking toward the other room and seeing the reflection of a basketball game.  It was coming from the bar/lounge.  Can't we do without TV in a restaurant like this.  This just bugs me to no end.  If I wanted to eat in a sports bar, I would have.\n\nI really was disappointed by this whole evening.  With so many great steakhouses on the Strip, I won't be returning to Charlie Palmers."

After much research, I opted for Charlie Palmer Steak House at the Four Seasons Hotel.  First I am glad that this restaurant has a full menu bar which allowed me to eat without sitting at a table for one lol.  The bartender recommended a Mai-Tai to start which I enjoyed and had  two for the night.  For appetizer I ordered the Citrus marinated wild Baja prawns which if I paid more attention to the menu, I would not have ordered it since it was a cocktail shrimp.  Thought it would have been cooked in a citrus sauce so not what I expected but decent...why such beautiful prawns are cocktails is beyond me.  The bartender did not charge me for the prawns after I explained my disappointment but not due their fault but mine and I ate only 1-1/2 shrimp out of 5-6 provided.  The Main course per recommendation from the bartender was the bone-in Rib-Eye and an add-On of half a lobster for an additional $25.  The steak was cooked to perfection of medium rare with, as expected, rare near the bone.  The steak was well marbled and as stated earlier perfectly cooked.  Now the flavor was...I was not blown away.  The seasoning was not spectacular and I should have ordered a bernaise sauce of truffle butter to supplement the flavor.  I love the steak seasoning from Cattlemans of Indian Cliff in El Paso Texas, they know how to flavor a steak.  The lobster on the other hand was delicious and wished I ordered the 2lb lobster instead but this is a steak house and steak will be the main course.  For dessert, again recommended by the bartender, I had the coconut tres leche  can.  I like the cake, being I am a Hawaiian boy, which was moist with freshness if the thinly sliced strawberries, Crispy coconut flakes, a mild mouse, a strawberry sauce, and a dallop of coconut ice cream.  Many ingredients that combined to pleasant dessert.  \n\n-Atmosphere/ambiance, beautiful restaurant in a beautiful hotel 5\n\n-Service, I had the bartender who was on point 5\n\n-Food, being I had high expectations due to advertisement as best steak house after only 4 months opened, I have to give this restaurant a 3.  I enjoyed the lobster and dessert but I wanted to be WoW'd by the steak and I wasn't.\n\nI wish I could award a half star for 3-1/5 stars but I just wasn't WoW'd.  By far, the Cattlemans at Indian Cliff s a far better steak house, granted I did not eat the $35 and once Kobe beef but that's beyond my budget.\n\nTotal cost $138 for the meal with a $50 tip since they comp my appetizers."

The atmosphere was nice and dimly lit with excellent service. First off we started with a cocktail while waiting for some of our party and i must say $17 for a shot of patron was a little shocking. We had the aged New York and Filet Mignon and it was definitely lacking in seasoning and flavor so I ended up dipping it in my friends blue cheese sauce which defeats the purpose of aged steak. The lobster fried rice was amazing probably the best thing i had there but the baked potato i could have done without. Dinner ended with a sampler of desserts and they were all really good. Over all it was a new experience but we will not be returning."

            "review": "My gf and I dined here last night as part of our Restaurant Week excursions. \n\nI made reservations for 8:15 and upon arrival, we were seated immediately at a cosy booth near the bar. I really liked the seating arrangement for tables for 2. They are like \"half-booths\" and you are seated right next to your dining partner. Also, our booth was at the wall immediately adjacent to the bar, so I could see the entire restaurant from my seat. Also, I really enjoyed this location because I could hear the soft tunes from the playlist that was being played at the bar - a nice mix of Coldplay, U2, Lana, etc. \n\nWe were immediately greeted by a waiter who asked for our water preference and brought us the cocktail and wine lists. My gf really wanted a sweet, strawberry flavored cocktail. They didn't have it on the menu, but they had a similar orange creamsicle type beverage. I asked the waiter if the bartender might be able to make something similar with strawberry - he returned within 5 minutes with exactly what we wanted. \n\nAnother waiter brought us bread and explained the menu to us. I was temped to diverge from the restaurant week menu, but really wanted to try the corn chowder. I had the corn chowder, the only entree option (filet medallions and lobster) and my gf had the caprice to start. All dishes were delicious. We also had garlic spinach and truffle potato gratin. Those dishes were also good - a bit heavy and the potatoes were very \"truffle-y\" but I was not disappointed. The steak and lobster were cooked perfectly. The filet medallions were not the best cut of meat I have ever had nor the tastiest, but I was satisfied with the way they were cooked and their overall flavor. The side dishes were large and neither of us were able to finish our meal. \n\nAfter dinner, they brought us each dessert which was a small ice cream sandwich looking thing that was kind of peanut-buttery with creme brulee ice cream (tiny scoop) and some chocolate sauce. It was delicious. Small, but delicious. I was already stuffed from dinner. \n\nOverall, the service was great. One complaint though is that there were about 4 different waiters coming to our table at different times, so it was difficult to know who was taking care of us. Generally, I prefer one waiter, maybe two, so that it is more of a personal experience. \n\nThe atmosphere here is wonderful and just the way I like it. Dim lights, classy, and tables spaced far enough away from one another so that you do not feel like everyone can hear your conversation. \n\nReally nice meal and I am happy I chose this restaurant. \n\nTip: If you do not want to self-park at Mandalay and then walk the miles it seems to take to get to the Four Seasons, there is a lot just outside of the entrance to the Four Seasons where you can park and then walk up the driveway towards the hotel entrance/valet."

I have been to one other Charlie Palmer Restaurant and had a good experience and therefore thought that the quality of food at the steakhouse would be just as good.  I am a local Las Vegas attorney and routinely frequent many of the higher end steakhouses in the Las Vegas valley including Del Frisco's, STK at the Cosmopolitan, The Capital Grille, etc.  The prices at the Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse were comparable to other high end steakhouses and hence I expected that the quality would be on par.  I ordered the 40 oz Tomahawk Bone-In Ribeye which cost $110 (not including side dishes). The steak had very little marbling and was overcooked.  Put simply, the steak lacked flavor.  Moreover, at no time did the waiter ask me about the quality of my cut, which for a high end steakhouse is unusual.   Perhaps, the chef that night was having an \"off night\" but I am unlikely to return to Charlie Palmer Steakhouse."

We tried making last minute reservations but they only had 5pm and 10pm available and since we didn't want to eat with the blue haired patrons or eat with the wait staff, we decided to explore our options. \n\nCut also only had a 5:15pm available and Carnevino had no openings... so I went down my steakhouse list and found Charlie Palmer Steakhouse. Anticipating a booked night, I still called and was surprised by how many openings they had. I originally asked for 8pm and then changed it later to 7pm and with each call, there was a \"sure no problem\"... All of this should have been a precursor to our meal. \n\nMy steak preferences are as follows:\nI like when steak is seared with a crust and then finished in a really HOT oven. I like when steak is seasoned with a bit of salt and pepper prior to being cooked. Good steak should never be covered in a sauce. Finally, I like when they take out a really hot steak and finish it with a little bit of butter. Is that too much to ask? \n\nWell the steak that I ordered at CP did not have any of the above. In fact they poured a wine reduction that they called a \"jus\" and it lacked all taste. \n\nI would never go back..."

I am going to do my best to cover all the bases here, but I gotta be honest. Charlie Palmer Steak delivered one of the greatest and most synchronized dining experiences I have ever had and this is how the story goes. \n\nThe location:\n\nLocated inside the four seasons hotel, the restaurant itself is a bit darker than I enjoy, but it's a huge location that is very inviting. There is a very nice bar located near the front that seemed to be a bit dead. More than likely that has more to do with the fact that if your reservation is for 7PM you get seated at 7PM. That is how it went on Wednesday night, so I am not sure how it works out on the weekends when there are more folks in town.\n\nThe menu: \n\nVery extensive menu that hits on a number of different price points. They give you an opportunity to go small, medium or big and big is B-I-G!!! They have what's called the \"cut of the week\" which is a pri fix menu option that includes 3 courses and two sides for $48. That's a great deal for the amount of food they serve. \n\nThe Food:\n\nI knew before I sat down that I was going to pay a premium for dinner and that wasn't an issue for me. I was just hoping that the food would be off the charts good and I would get what I paid for and that's exactly how it went down. \n\nWe ordered oysters which were from the pacific northwest (I forget the name but I'm not hypercritical about the specific types of oysters when I dine at a high end restaurant) and they were amazing. Perfectly chilled, perfectly shucked and almost as fresh as the oysters I get here in San Francisco. My date doesn't even dig oysters and she loved them.\n\nMy date for the evening, Lizzy, ordered their \"cut of the week\" option and it was as follows:\n\nFirst course Bib lettuce salad\n\nThe lettuce was too large to eat and probably could have been chopped to fit on the fork. The blue cheese was really strong for my taste but the bacon lardons were perfectly crisp and delicious. Overall the salad was good, but nothing special.\n\nSecond course 16 oz. NY Steak\n\nThe cut was a very large portion and it was cooked almost perfectly. It had a bit too much gristle for my taste but it Lizzy killed it so she clearly didn't have a problem with it. Seasoned well, tender and the sauce that accompanied it was flavorful and a great addition. \n\nDessert Meyer Lemon Creme Brulee \n\nCustard is not my thing but I tried it. It was a bit too tart for my taste buds and I wouldn't order it. \n\n2 sides Baby Broccoli and Garlic Mashed Potatoes\n\nBaby broccoli was cooked just they way I like it. Crisp, bright green and still crunchy but cooked all the way through. Garlic mashed were good. It tasted like there was a bit of truffle oil goin on but I was focused on the red meat more than the starch. I mean, I didn't come to Vegas for the mashed potatoes. Feel me??\n\nMy Entree  Surf and Turf\n\nWonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked filet mignon. Melt in your mouth good and absolutely amazing quality on this cut. Each bite tasted better than the previous bite. half tail of Maine lobster, cooked perfectly, with drawn butter and it was stuffed with a truly delicious mix of lobster, lobster stalk, fresh bread crumbs and a few special ingredients the waiter left out. Lobster meat was pulled away from the shell, which is a nice touch b/c who really wants to sit there with a bib on shucking lobster from the shell? I sure don't. \n\nDessert\n\nThe waiter comes out with these tiny, fabulous house made ice cream sandwiches, compliments of the chef. They were too kill for! The cookies were soft, delicious and the ice cream was a creamy dream of wonderful. We could have eaten about 8 more of those bad boys without an issue. \n\nThe service\n\n10 out of 10. The waiter was friendly, he knew the menu up and down, answered all of our questions (and we had plenty) and was on top of his game. A step further. Our waiter had a party of 8 and a party of 6 seated as we were eating dinner. Instead of ditching us all together, another waiter came over to make sure we were doing ok and was also on top of his game. The communication between waiters, servers and the rest of the staff was absolutely perfect and I had never seen anything like it. Something as simple as pouring water in a glass was handled with such care. The waiter would hold a napkin over the glass each time she/he poured making sure we didn't get splashed. At times, they were a bit too fast for their own good. They took away my fork, knife and small plate after they cleared the oysters, but I'm not complaining because I was flat out impressed by the attention to detail. Each and every person working the room had a smile on their face, they were chatty but not too chatty, they took pics of people who wanted them to and it was truly a top notch dining experience and I can't wait to head back for more."

One of the best ways I've had Foie Gras with sweets!\n\nFirst course was Australian Wagyu Carpaccio with Truffle Salad. Carpaccio was tender, tasty, and melt in your mouth! The salad was salty, so the truffle taste was hidden.  I ate up every bite of the beef, but left almost the entire salad, and I love truffles :(\n\nMain course, Bone-In Filet Mignon: Bone Marrow Flan and Port Wine Reduction. First bite, I noticed it was a little \"cooler\" than I am used to...then I realized it was cooked rare. It was pretty tender and flavorful, but towards the bone, I started to hear it Moooing lol. Port Wine reduction was ok, a little distracting personally. No real char on the outside...they probably oven cook it to temp with no major sear.  Bone Marrow Flan didn't do much for me either.\n\nThe sides, Parmesan Potato Gratin and Jalape\u00f1o Creamed Corn.  Both were creamy and yummy...I liked the melted cheese on top on the potatoes. Good stuff!  And it was very tasty corn! I didn't notice the jalapeno at all though...so no, it was not spicy in the slightest. I did scoop out pretty much all of that corn though! Yum\n\nAnd for dessert, Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar: Caramel Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. This was super rich and tasty! I love peanut butter desserts!  \n\nService was a bit slow, steak was cooked wrong, and overall the food was good but not great.  A-OK in my book...\n\nMaybe I'll come back and try the cut of the week deal when the time is right.\n\nPics :"

            "review": "This year has been an amazing year for food, I must say, especially since I've seen or met many famous celebrity chefs that I've seen on TV and eaten at their restaurants.  Do I have Las Vegas to thank for this?  Maybe so!\n\nThere was Mario Batali and Tom Douglas in Seattle earlier this year, Hubert Keller, Rick Moonen, and now finally Charlie Palmer.  And Mr. Palmer actually cooked my dinner!\n\nAs people have expressed in their reviews here, Charlie Palmer Steak has one of the best specials going on the strip that I have ever seen, their \"Cut of the Week\" prix fixe 3-course menu with UNLIMITED WINE PAIRINGS for only $48 per person.  Yes you heard me, ALL YOU CAN DRINK WINE PAIRINGS.  This is no cheap wine either, my friends.  This is the good stuff.  One of the courses we had was this wonderful Bastianich Winery selection, which goes for probably $40 per bottle.\n\nThis particular week the courses were:\n\nFirst Course:\nComposed Salad - organic watercress, poached pairs, goat cheese mousse, hazelnut Vinaigrette.\n\nMain Course:\n14 ounce Grass Fed New York Strip Loin - with caramelized sweet onions and smoked sea salt\n\nSides:\nButternut Squash Risotto, Roasted Root Veggies\n\nDesert:\nDark Chocolate Spearmint Bar\n\nWithout going into massive detail about each course, everything was pretty spot on and lovely.  Except the steak.  Not my husband's steak, my steak.  It was weird, the flavor was completely different from his, and it was tough and bland.  \n\nYou're probably wondering why I gave a tough and bland steakhouse five stars.  Since it tasted so differently than my husband's it was an obvious execution mistake, so I sent it back.  They were so apologetic and went to recook it.  When it came back, it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  They said, \"chef made it himself,\" and I looked up and there was Charlie Palmer himself running around in a cook's jacket.  Very impressive, and it was amazingly cool.  On top of it, we got a complimentary truffled baked potato, which was amazing.  Every time I have had a truffled potato dish in a high end restaurant, I have been disappointed.  This was perfect.\n\nAnyway, I have seen some great selections on the cut of the week menu.  A few weeks ago they had some snake river farms beef selections.  If you have not had snake river farms waygu beef, it is absolutely amazing.  I believe this is the American Waygu beef that Cut uses on their menu as well.\n\nSo to wrap things up here, try Charlie Palmer Steak mainly for the cut of the week menu.  I can't compare it to other high end steakhouses on the strip because they don't have such an amazing deal, but my husband and I really loved this meal and are looking forward to going again."

I had a couple of their \"Knickerbocker\" cocktails. They were really good. We also enjoyed some oysters for an appetizer. Nothing extraordinary about them, but they were yummy.\nService was very good. I like a place that keeps my water glass filled. We didn't order dessert, because as usual we were too full. However, the waiter brought over some chocolate chip cookies filled with vanilla ice cream. Funny how I had room to try one. I must say, it was tasty.\nI liked the ambiance here. I like the fact that we weren't dining on top of other patrons. Some Vegas restaurants squeeze in as many people as possible."

            "review": "The slots upstairs would have provided a better value than this meal.\n\nOn a recommendation my wife and I along with some friends chose Charlie Palmer Steakhouse for dinner. We were promptly seated upon arrival at a sizable table for our party of five; however, the chairs were awkwardly arranged and required some uncomfortable shifting and straddling of table legs. The service while friendly seemed to be mildly disorganized to the point of being somewhat intrusive.\n\nWe were asked four separate times if we needed assistance; however, it is the wine list that needs the help. We found the selection to be extremely lacking and incredibly overpriced even for Vegas. A \"budget\" Bordeaux at $95 was reluctantly selected and even more reluctantly accepted after tasting. The wine had not spoiled but was by far one of the poorest quality Bordeaux's we have tasted, deep apologies for not remembering the vintner.\n\nThe table bread may have been the highlight of the evening and I applaud the chef for producing a cornbread that my wife thoroughly enjoyed, she hates cornbread... I will also give a nod to the butternut ravioli soup; it was flavorful and with a rich consistency. Sadly this is where the praise ends.\n\nMain course was bone-in rib-eye and the potatoes au gratin. The steak was properly cooked but had the consistency and taste of something one would order from Sizzler. The potatoes were undercooked, overly starchy and lacking in overall taste. When paying for a premium aged steak I expect to be delighted by every bite not struggling to put the meal down to justify the premium price tag. Everyone in our party ordered something different with similar results.\n\nVegas is all about knowing when to walk away and we didn't bother trying the desserts. As hard as it is for me to dislike a steakhouse, I have to strongly recommend against visiting this establishment. For your money you are better off at Morton's or Sinatra (Encore).\n\nGood luck!"

I want to say we had one of the best steaks yet so far in my short steak eating history and my husband who is a steak connoisseur(so he believes) said it was a fantastic dry aged steak. Not to mention the baked potato was cooked to perfection and the Burrata salad was just awesome melt in your mouth!

Everything impeccable, also very pricey and the low light doesn't quite hide the pricey. We went with glasses of Prosecco, $15, tasty and found a pinot by the glass that we really liked, Slate?, for $14, otherwise bottles start near a $100 and we had already planned on just EATing here while drinking before and AFTER. HUGE interesting wine list.\n\nOur server, Raymond, was very helpful and was having as much fun as we were after awhile as the place started slowing down after 9pm. We had the sweet and sour calamari as an appetizer and it was a very complex with just enough heat to make it really memorable.  We went with the 10 ounce fillet, perfectly medium rare of course and my other half loves pork chops and somehow always gets the best ones, this one was almost 2\" thick a Berkshire with Mango-Pineapple Chutney, lovely. I added some of the best french fries I have ever had as a side, along with the HIGHly recommended wild mushrooms with carmelized onions, and a caesar salad. And it was all VERY good. Each mushroom saute is prepared to order and I am going to spend the rest of the year trying to duplicate that recipe. \n\nWe aren't that big a Desert eaters but we went wild, special occasion, with warm Maple Peach Crisp (scoop of Oatmeal Cookie Ice Cream) and the Lemon Raspberry Creme Brulee, actually that last one was a gift from the restaurant because this was a birthday dinner. Thanks Raymond, also for the extra olive bread.\n\nI can certainly recommend this for special occasions or every night if you've got somebody's corporate card. Portions were largeish and we did take home half our dinners as delicious leftovers. I believe there is also a monthly special, \"cut of the month\" for $49 with a couple of sides and wine that would also be a way to come here a little more often and keep it under $300. You are worth it."

            "review": "I dined at Charlie Palmer Steak many years ago when it had just opened.  I remember it being really good back then. By his time, it was very mediocre.  I had the wagyu short rib with sweet and sour beets and horseradish cream.  It's as if The chef forgot to season the beef- it was so bland.  Short ribs are typically so tender that you can cut them with a fork.  Not this. I struggled with cutting it with a knife because it was dry.  The beets were fine, but the horseradish lacked the spicy kick that is typical of horseradish.  I also had hamachi sashimi to start.  This was underwhelming.  The best dish was the potatoes gratin.  These are very good.  The creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts are good as well.  We tried the Pineapple Upside Down cake for dessert, and this was underwhelming and dry.  I was intrigued by the thyme ice cream, so I ordered a scoop of that- except it came in an interesting \"rack\" of 6 scoops.  Had I known and was told, I would have gotten some other flavors.  Couldn't eat 6 scoops  of a single flavor that was just so-so.  The service was friendly but slow.  A few of my dining mates sent their plates back because they were cooked incorrectly.  Overall not worth the high prices.  With so many steakhouses in LV, you're better off going somewhere else."

At the end of our meal, he offered a side of the gratin potatoes to go and ON THE HOUSE!  What??!!  I've never heard of that happening before!\n\nFood and beverage...The first time I went here, I ordered the filet with blue cheese over it.  Steak was good, but too much blue cheese.  The second time I went, I opted for the rib-eye with bernaise.  It was awesome!  The wine list is ridiculously over-priced.  We ordered Silver Oak and I think it was over $300!\n\nIf you're willing to splurge while in Vegas and are a carnivore...check out Charlie Palmer Steak!

Three hearts of romaine were rapped with Serrano ham, the tastiest white anchovies I have ever had, and then dressed with a homemade Caesar dressing and croutons. This was hands-down the best Caesar I have had. While we were eating out salad, the drunk guy at the table next to us advised us to order these \"hatch chili peppers\", which are apparently a rare pepper only found in New Mexico and have the tendency to only be good two months out of the year. I am glad we listened to him because these grilled hatch peppers were amazing. They had a delicate flavor with a thin crisp skin. Some of the bites were spicier than others but the taste was similar to an Anaheim pepper mixed with a Serrano - fantastic. I ordered the 20 oz. New York strip steak and my friends ordered the Porterhouse and Hanger steak. All the steaks were prime cuts of Omaha beef, perfectly seasoned with coarse salt and pepper and then scorched under the broiler. Each steak had a nice crust and some grill marks, but wasn't over powered with char or that grilled taste. My NY strip was sheer perfection. The two-inch thick hunk of meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and just had the most amazing after taste.\n\nWe also ordered the saut\u00e9ed spinach and Yukon gold puree for sides. The mash potatoes were very good but lacked a bit of salt. The spinach was perfectly executed. It was cooked beautifully, having seasonings that nicely accompanied the leafy taste, while not having any bitterness what so ever. The spinach was definitely the best rendering of the boring vegetable I have ever had.\n\nAll in all, we could not have been more impressed by Charlie Palmer Steak. The steak was probably the best I have tasted while the appetizers and sides made the meal even more memorable."

The bread basket had several choices and the cornbread was very moist and delicious with the sweetened butter, and the olive bread was good as well. The first course of pea soup with crab was very fresh and springtimey tasting. The crab itself was a bit too salty but when mixed into the soup, tasted great. Then the burrata and strawberry tomato with balsamic was just scrumptious. Super fresh and creamy burrata, tasty and lightly sweet tomato. Again, the greens on their own  tasted oversalted, but if eaten together with the other components, it was just fine. The Australian wagyu was the most boring part of the meal, the sides of spring vegetables and mashed Aligot potatoes were average, but the Poached Egg/Bone Marrow Fried rice was quite unctuous tasting. The Caramelized White Chocolate Cheesecake with Candied Hazelnuts was just okay. But the oyster, burrata, and the pea soup were such standouts that I will definitely be returning here soon. Oh, and the unlimited wine pairing: while not stellar wines, were good enough that we had a glass and a half of each."

Filet with bleu cheese fondue was amazing, cooked to perfection.  the oysters appetizer was delicious.  You will be well taken care of here, and it is one of the few places in Las Vegas that is quiet even busy.  Dine here with confidence."

            "review": "This was one of the most overrated restaurants I have ever eaten ate.  My husband and I love a good steak; and had the fortune of living in NYC for years and getting to eat at all the best steakhouses. If this one was in NYC I don't think it would stay in business long. We were at The Four Seasons for a 3 night mini vacation. We decided to go here on our last night. The prior nights we went to Aureole (excellent) and Verandah next door - also excellent. This one fell flat from the start. The biggest thing was the service. They have the typical steakhouse multiple servers - and they were so slow tending to our needs that I almost got up and poured our own champagne from the bottle we ordered. To start; my husband has the raw tuna and I had oysters - both were the highlight of the meal; and excellent, but of course involved very little preparation. For dinner I had the filet and my husband had the bone-in New York Strip. My husband's was above average; the filet was below average. \n\nWhen the bill came there was no pen so we had to ask the host for one (we wanted to charge it to our room). He made a big deal about wanting to verify that we were actually staying the hotel. If that was the the only weird thing I'd be OK. But they also made a big deal wanting to verify the champagne we ordered. Together, that was classless.\n\nThe only defense I have for the restaurant was that it was restaurant week and the place was packed with people ordering the $50 prix fix. The couple beside us ranted and raved about their steak and told the waiter its so good, we never get to do this, the only place we go out for dinner is Burger King. If Burger King is your normal restaurant, then this place is probably good. If you are going for fine dining, I'd take a pass. If you want to try a Charlie Palmer restaurant; aureole is 1000 times better."

We had a gift card in the amount of $400 and used it 2x while visiting Sin City. The only drawback is that you have to search a little around for the restaurant since it's located inside of Mandalay Bay. \n\nWe ordered the surf and turf with a few entrees and were very pleased. The lobster was fresh, soft and very meaty. I would also say that the steak was premium quality. \n\nThe food was sensational, but the real bonus is the fine customer service this place offers. We had no less than 3 different staff members waiting on us at any given moment, each doing their best to make sure we had a great time. \n\nFinally, their coffee is some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. I ordered a carafe, and polished off the whole pot. I can't say enough about superb this restaurant is."

No problem getting there with a short cab ride.  Was a relief to be away from the loud masses of people for a while.  I had read about this restaurant on several review pages, so we knew to ask for the Michael Jackson tribute and cut of the week options.  This was an unbelievable value for 49 a person with three courses including wine pairing with two.  We both went with the MJ meal and chose the bone in filet.  First course a delicious Bibb salad with a French pairing of white wine blend was very good.  Excellent bread basket and attentive service throughout.  Our next course of filet was superb.  A perfectly cooked melt in your mouth filet was accompanied by a delicious sauce and a small amount on garlic mashed potatoes.  We were surprised at the large portion of steak for the price point.   The pairing with this course was a red Shiraz from California.  I wasn't overly impressed with this selection, but it was acceptable.  Finally out third course included three full desserts.  Yes, three.  I was in dessert heaven.  Unfortunately too full to eat too much of it, but he chocolate cake is calling my name from our hotel fridge right now.  Banana's foster cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e was our favorite.  Hazelnut dessert also delicious.  Chocolate cake complimentary for husband's bday hasn't been eaten yet.  This is by far the best deal in Vegas.  We will be back again in the future!"

The cut of meat was a New York Strip.  Very tender and flavorful.  \n\nSince everything was ala carte the price really got stupid high with an appetizer, salad, and vegetable.  I would say other than the steak the food was average.  What swings it back up to 4 stars was the perfect service.  Just the type you could expect."

We ate there last Wednesday while on vacation and were seated immediately (although we were a little late for our reso)...BUT we sat there for 10 minutes before we even got a menu/water/hello! Nobody even acknowledged us for far too long! We finally got water then sat for another five+ minutes before we got menus and then the waiter briefly stopped by (he didn't introduce himself so I don't know his name but he was a larger guy), very unfriendly. He took our food order before he took our drink order...strange! Too make things worse, he took one person's drink order (4 total) and then he walked away real quickly and started chatting with another employee! ummm hello? the rest of of us would like a drink too! He came back after a minute and when someone asked where he went, his response was \"oh uh I walked over there for a minute\". Anyway, our food came out fairly quickly and it was very good. 4 stars for the food! Very similar to the Flemming's style food I'm used to...although N9NE in the Palms blows them all out of the water! \n\nConclusion - If I'm spending that much money on dinner I at least expect the service that I get at Chili's!"

While we enjoyed our meals, the food was on par or slightly below other comparable high end steak restaurants on the strip. My steak was undercooked initially, which was quickly addressed by the staff. While we had a good meal, I think we would only go back for the cut of the week deal ($50/3 courses).

            "review": "Sure I was intrigued by the Wine Angels at Aureole in Vegas.  Who wouldn't  be?  Yet, was it enough to pull me into the restaurant?  As someone who usually finds \"special effects\" movies boring and lacking in substance, it left me a bit leery.  However, after years of hearing about how innovative Charlie Palmer is as a chef (some of these raves from friends whose opinions I value greatly) and watching his restaurant empire grow, I am happy to say I finally have tried not one, but two of his restaurants.  In order to give both of these restaurants the attention they deserve I am writing about them in two parts.  This, the first part, will detail my outing to Charlie Palmer Steak in Las Vegas.\n\nNestled inside the Four Seasons Hotel, it is a nice departure from the rest of the Vegas Scene.  Don't get me wrong, I do love the hustle, bustle and noise of the whole strip scene, but it is also nice to take a short break from it for a more refined experience.  That refined experience is definitely reflected in the decor of the restaurant. The arched doorways, ceilings and ochre walls hint at Southwestern Spanish Architecture, while the dark mahogany paneling and furnishings give it an Upper East Side Club Room feel.  The mix of these two styles work beautifully together in creating an atmosphere of relaxed elegance and sophistication; taking two old world styles and making them somehow modern.\n\nI experienced Charlie Palmer Steak as a party of six. No, I didn't eat enough for six people (although it did feel like it), it was myself plus five others.  A table full of foodies with everyone wanting to try out as much as possible, we had a fairly wide range of the menu at our table.  I will do my best to cover as much of it as humanly possible. :)  Sadly the photos that I took did not come out (need to remember to bring a flash camera!).\n\nWhile four in our party waited for the final two, we enjoyed a glass of Tamarack Cellars Merlot 2007 (nice full bodied with flavors of raspberry, black cherry and hints of chocolate) and took in the atmosphere.  When the final two arrived, the game began!! Not only did we order a full array of appetizers, but our crazy group made a special request to the chef to make us potato chips (not on the menu), and he did!!  And by the way, the freshly made potato chips were awesome.\n\nOn to the appetizers!!  I had the Wild Arugula Salad with Roasted Beets, Oregon Blue, Pecans and a Sherry Vinaigrette.  The arugula was fresh and crisp and the presentation was beautiful with slices of roasted beets and a puree of beet.  The combination of elements came together perfectly for a perfect salad.  The rest of the table shared several appetizers. The Ahi Tuna Carpaccio had barely hit the table when it disappeared and additional servings were immediately ordered (I think that says it all!!).  In rapid succession, Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Oysters on the Half Shell and Brocconcini Mozzarella w/ Cured Tomatoes arrived at our table and were ooohed and aaaahed over.  Like the arugula salad, the presentations were just right and  inviting.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers which lived up to Charlie Palmer's image of being a pioneer of progressive American cuisine.   The fusion of classic American cooking with Soba Noodles and a ginger lime vinaigrette (Ahi Tuna Carpaccio) or Foie Gras and White Plum Tart expands the concept of American cuisine to a whole new level that left everyone chomping at the bit for the main course.\n\nFor the main course, Surf and Turf (Roasted Maine Lobster/Filet Mignon), Filet Mignon with Roasted Shallot Jus, American Kobe Beef Tartare and Crispy Skinned Japanese \"Suzuki\" Sea Bass were thoroughly enjoyed by the rest of our group.  I feasted on a plate composed of sides: Wild Mushrooms w/ Carmelized Onions, Garlic Broccolini and an order of the wonderful CP Steak Fries. just thinking about the amazing flavors on my plate is making my mouth water as I write this. There were also sides ordered for the table: Lobster Rice, Sauteed Spinach, more CP Steak Fries and a Truffle Baked Potato.  The Truffle Baked Potato was amazing, but so rich that I didn't have much room left but to have a small bite.\n\nAt this point I thought that I might have actually been restrained enough to leave the restaurant without having someone roll me out, but then dessert was ordered.  Everyone shared an order each of the Warm Summer Fruit Crisp, Strawberry Vanilla Ice Cream Terrine, Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar, Chocolate Brownie Sundae and a selection of Fruit Sorbets.  I initially swore to only take little tastes of each to be able to experience them, but my resolve was not strong enough and I hate to admit that I had more than a taste of each.  I just couldn't resist!!  \n\nAs we wrapped up our meal and prepared to leave, I had to admit that I was impressed with the entire meal, both presentation and ingenuity in blending flavors.\n\nwww.ladieswholunchtravel.com"

Only complaint on the surf and turf is for $70, I would have liked more lobster meat. Half of the shell had meat, the other half had a stuffed lobster that tasted cheesy, which I didn't care for. Filet was perfectly cooked, cut well and was delicious. Shared a truffle baked potato, and potato gratin which were outstanding. Brown butter apple pie was a great choice for dessert as well, and we loved every bit of it. We will definitely be back."

My friend was able to find a deal on a \"Cut of the Week\" prix fixe menu that was going for about $50 with unlimited wine to boot.  The meal came with bread, salad, and 3 side dishes (including asparagus, potatoes au gratin, sauteed mushrooms) and skirt steak as the meat of the week.  It also included unlimited pairing with 2 selected wines (1 white and 1 red).  Granted I'm not a huge foodie and my palate is not as discerning as some, but the meal was fantastic and even a better value.  The meat portion was huge, but most of us still managed to devour it all, it was so good, perfectly seasoned and cooked med rare.  The side dishes were also very good, though slightly on the salty side.  But $48 at Charlie Palmer??!!  with liquor??  The ambiance is very upscale and service is very attentive, worthy of a high end steak restaurant.  I'd highly recommend this place for a great meal in a cozy, upscale environment which is both suitable for a date or bunch of drunk friends (ok ok you still should at least wear a button-up shirt and have closed toe shoes)."

However, the yukon gold potato puree that comes with the meal is amazingly good also. Yes, we ate them both. So...... we had to take our yummy chocolate cake back to our room and savor it in bed.\n         Service was impeccable, and I rarely say that.

I started off with the butter poached Alaskan King Crab Spaghettini.  Simply put: outstanding.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, crab did not have that sometimes-salty seawater flavor - instead it blended perfectly with the sauce (which was not overly added).\n\nFor my main course I chose the dry aged 14 oz bone in New York strip.  The steak was cooked/seasoned perfectly and loaded with flavor.\n\nDessert I opted for a molten chocolate souffl\u00e9 with a side of Gran Mariner sauce.  Again, the dessert was made perfectly and the complimentary ice cream cookies were an added bonus.\n\nAs for the food, I cannot say anything bad at all.  This would easily be a 5-star review if it were not for the service.  Our server, who complained loudly to the hostess about being overworked, sat us down and stated \"I will bring bread over immediately\".   His version of immediately meant us asking three different servers for bread and another server twice for drinks.  After our server took our order, we again had to ask multiple servers for drinks and we did not see our server until after our main courses came out.  The last part of the lack of service came when one member of our group noticed that her steak was overcooked (there was no doubt about it as the dryness of her steak could be observed visually without even cutting into it).  She asked for a second steak - no problem was the response.  However, some random server came out and proceeded to tell her that the lighting gave the steak the impression that it was overcooked - even though she took a bite and saw that it there was no red (she ordered medium rare) in the entire steak.\n\nAgain, Charlie Palmer steak - 5 stars for the food.  The lack of quality service knocks it down only 1 star because the food was so good.  Highly recommended.  Can't forget that the live band took my request and played it!"

The Best Steakhouse I've ever Been to yet.....\n\nSince we've been town we have been trying to decide which steak house to go to and finally decided Palmer's, and it was a great choice. The atmosphere was classy, inside  the four seasons hotel near Mandalay Bay Resort. The Food we ordered was all great. (shown in pictures if you want a visual) The shrimp in the cocktail was very fresh and the sauce had a sassy sweet taste, the tar tare was French style and very well seasoned, if you close your eyes you wouldn't know it was raw. I really enjoyed the Iceberg salad, the dressing was just enough and bleu cheese was the real deal. The Short Rib was very rich and tender, the best I've ever had. The bone in Rib Eye was the most tender perfectly cooked piece of meat on the planet, I wish I had more. For Desert it was the Chocolate peanut butter bar which was something out of \"GRAMMAS\" kitchen and the biggest surprise of all was the Lemon Tart which was completely original and extremely well presented. \n\nThe only imperfect thing about Palmer's was the service wasn't as good as I've had at other high dollar facilities. As of right now I'm calling number one for Steak In Vegas but there are still more visits in the future, Vegas has dozens of prime steak houses.\n\nCharlie Palmer's Steak :\nPresentation - 4.6 stars\nFood - 5 stars\nService - 4.2 stars"

One annoying thing at this place was that the butter was so hard/cold you couldn't use it on the soft bread.  Get with it."

The food was ok, the server was terrible. \n\nWe both ordered the filet mignon. I had the ahi trio, he had the jumbo shrimp. The ahi carpaccio was the best out of the three. The shrimp was good. Overall we felt like the food was under seasoned. It would have been nice to have salt and pepper so we had the option to season our food.\n\nThe service - it started out good. The server was initially friendly. Early on, him and the table next to us realized they had some kind of connection. That's when our service basically ended. We got our appetizers before the table next to us and heard the waiter ask the runner why he did that. He checked in and chatted with the table next to us, refilled their glasses, gave them extra food \"compliments of the chef.\" We barely got a second glance.\n\nThe food runners were very nice and accommodating. The GM stopped by and checked in with us. He was very nice but at that point we were over it. For the price point, the experience should be memorable in a good way. We're pretty sure we will not return."

The service was perfect from beginning to end. We were served good quality bread with butter as an appetizer. We ordered some red wine that was suggested to us by a manager, however, it was a little too dry for my taste even though we asked him to suggest something that wasn't too dry. I guess everyone's tastes are relative anyway. Moving onto the main course, the food and steak really lives up to all the hype!! The meat was very juicy and tender. The meal was so good! My boss even told me he specifically comes here to eat every time he goes to Vegas. I was full and for the price and service I think it was worth it. It came down to around $100 a person for the meal excluding dessert. The dim ambiance also adds a special touch here!"

Everything was prepared perfectly and the red pepper aoli is to die for. I'm not normally a dessert person but the mint ice cream sandwich is amazing. The mint is a true to taste herb mint (not the fake mint flavored ice cream you get from the supermarket) and the dark chocolate crisp went perfectly with the port we ordered. \n\nAfter one meal Charlie Palmers has earned its place as one of my top three favorite restaurants and I now understand why my boyfriend is obsessed with it.

Visit coincided with Restaurant Week 2013, but that's not why we were there; nevertheless, the waiter immediately pushed that menu - he didn't even bring us the regular menu or wine list, only placing the Restaurant Week menu in front of us.\n\nRight away some others in my party decided to do the Restaurant Week menu, and the waiter refused to allow others to order a la carte. I can understand requesting the entire table stick to the same tasting for a multiple-course extravaganza that makes serving different numbers of courses too awkward and difficult, but a 3-course appetizer/entr\u00e9e/dessert combo is typical enough that it just should not be a problem.\n\nService continued to be very bad throughout the night. There's just too much that went wrong to list, but highlights include:  A busser clumsily refilling waters all night, splashing me once and another party member twice; a nearly 40-minute wait for the steak; said steak winding up being severely undercooked anyway; a food runner managing to drop two pieces of bone marrow onto a party member's dress and not even bothering to pick the pieces off the floor, leaving them scattered around our feet; and nearly getting run over by a waiter hurriedly pushing his serving table around a corner, him having to stop so suddenly that utensils flew off the side. The raw volume of problems combined with the staff's generally blas\u00e9 attitude show a systemic customer service issue at the restaurant, probably due to lack of sufficient standards and training.\n\nAs far as the actual food, the potato leek soup was pretty good as was the truffle scalloped potatoes - but the steak was just way too salty and over-seasoned (and again, severely undercooked - as in gushing red when I requested medium rare). The salad and dessert were just OK. The wine pairings tasted awful and were a horrible deal at $25. Reading other reviews here, maybe it was supposed to have been a \"bottomless\" wine pairing, but this was not explained to our table nor were we offered refills. I certainly would have chosen a quality-over-quantity alternative for wine had it been mentioned. Maybe people who just want to get toasted off cheap wine are the ones who appreciate it.\n\nGiven my good experience at Aureole a few years ago, this was certainly very disappointing. I would normally feel inclined to try the regular menu to give the place a second chance, but the numerous service issues and lack of concern demonstrated by the staff leave me disinterested."

We're glad we did because this place did not disappoint!\n\nWe parked at Mandalay Bay and walked over to the Four Seasons, whose entrance is located by the lobby of MB. Once you're in the Four Seasons, the restaurant is located on the lower floor so take the grand stairwell and you will be led towards Charlie Palmer and their other restaurant, Veranda. \n\nWe were immediately welcomed as we walked in. We made a reservation a couple days before and it was a nice touch of them to acknowledge us by name. We were seated and handed their regular menu and their RW 2016 menu. \n\nWith the RW Menu I went with:\nBilli Bi Soup- WINNER OF THE NIGHT. The soup is first presented to you with just the mussels and garnish then the soup is poured in front of you. The soup was creamy, delicious, and full of flavor! \nSurf & Turf- Meat was tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. Really enjoyed the lobster stuffing that accompanied the decently sized piece of lobster meat. It had an interesting taste that really complemented the taste of the steak!\nLemon Tart- Best way to end the meal, tart but light!\n\nWe all received a glass of red wine and white wine to pair with our appetizer and entree. And in case you were wondering...yes, it was a bottomless wine. Between the five of us, we also received 3 sets of Creamed Corn and Mashed Potato to share which was more than enough for us! \n\nService was also flawless! Our server Reymond stopped by our table regularly to make sure everything turned out great, the bussers immediately filled our water glasses whenever it's almost empty, and their management team even stopped by that we were well-taken care of! \n\nOverall, everything was amazing! Considering the price we are paying for Restaurant Week, we received PLENTY of food that left us leaving happy and stuffed!"

Followed by a PERFECTLY COOKED rib-eye steak that impressed me because even though I ordered it medium well most restaurants tend to overcook it, but it still had some pink inside. Had a sweet onion brown sauce which was a little over salted. Steak was not tender, a little tough which I found strange. Had fingerling potatoes-good, potatoes au gratin so-so and broccolini which was very good. It was my wife's birthday and as a nice touch they brought us a creme brulee and ice cream cookie sandwich that were both delicious. Service was understated, no rush and unattentive which was a little bothersome for a restaurant of this calibre. Would I go again to the Vegas restaurant?

Sides were ok and desert was good. Wine pairing here was always well done and the red was spot on a Spanish Grenacha but the white was a monkey bay sauv Blanc that you can buy for 5 bucks at any grocery store.\n\nI know that the wines are bargain wines but they had always done a good job finding off the wall brands or regions which made the wines at least interesting. \n\nI hope management reads this part.... This has been a great Vegas secret for a long time and has always felt like a deal, the main cut needs to be something of quality. what was served was embarrassing to the restaurant and the Charlie Palmer name. Either charge a little more for a decent cut or serve lamb or veal or less expensive flat iron and hanger but for the first time I felt I overpaid for what I got from you guys.  Get it together"

(you would think a high end place like this would have an hd feed.)\n\na jovial waiter showed us to our tables.  my friends and i were famished from a day of loitering, gambling, and gawking so we tore into the bread.  to be honest i don't recall what it was but it satisfied us. between the four of us we ordered the filet mignon (2), rib eye, and a ny strip.  all these fancy steak houses say their steaks have been dry aged for x amount of days, weeks, years, decades, millenia, etc.  to me this reminds me of saying you can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig.  i'll stick to this assertion until i have a dry aged steak that knocks my socks off or beats what i can get back home in rural iowa.  \n\ni sipped on a jack and coke to dull my hunger pains.  just as i finished off the second jack, my rib eye appeared.  it was shaped like africa and grilled medium rare, just the way i ordered it.  i let a  bit size piece sit in my mouth and waited.  as a steak connoisseur i relish this brief passage of time, from the moment a steak touches my taste buds and the info relayed  to my brain for decoding.  it's akin to watching a beauty pageant and waiting to see who will be the new queen and who will be the first runner up.  you really want a certain contestant a while back as your favorite to win but you never know  until the end.  it's the same with steak-you really want it to be great but never know.\n\nand the winner is ...\n\nnot charlie palmer but a steak house to be named later.   the rib eye was tender and pink but it lacked the sweetness and depth that i'm looking for in a top notch steak.  to me it needed a bit more fat.  a sublime rib eye is marbled well which gives the steak flavor and a more lively texture.  my friends' filet mignon had a bit more taste which surprised me, but i've had better and even cheaper before.\n\nall in all i think charlie palmers is still a solid place. their sides were outstanding with impeccable service. and the classy but non fussy ambiance is refreshing in vegas.  but i'm still searching for the perfect steak house."

Ever.\n\nWhen we made reservations, they tried to lure us with a fixed price menu of: salad, filet, and dessert for $55.  This was their idea, not ours.  \n\nWhen we arrived, they said that was not available.  After our waiter conferences with the chef, the manager, and several other people who met in hushed tones in the back and then asked us who exactly was it that told us that a fixed price was available, they offered us a salad, a strip steak, and two pieces of ravioli each.  \n\nGiven that this is a steakhouse, I was very underwhelmed.  I think they justified our \"special accomodation\" by giving us the oldest, chewiest piece of steak they had.  Neither myself or my dining parter could finish the steak.  Frankly, it hurt my jaw.  \n\nIt was unacceptable steak at any price."

I was trying to order light, so I ordered the sea bass with asparagus.  We all shared multiple veggies.  However, if there was a spoiler to the night, it was when our COO ordered the wagyu steak but clearly told everyone he is allergic to mushrooms.  Unfortunately, it came covered in sauce so he didn't notice until near the end of the meal when he felt sick that there were mushrooms in the meal.  Our waiter was so kind and apologetic and we knew it wasn't his fault but there was a breakdown in either communication someplace among the staff or there was a lack of oversight in the kitchen.  Pity because we had so enjoyed the restaurant until the food allergy took over the night.  I hate to give them lower stars, but they were clearly alerted to his food allergy."

            "review": "Easily one of the two or three best restaurants in all of Vegas.  Located in the ultra elegant Four Seasons, you are treated like a high-roller as soon as you pull up in your cab and the doormen greet you.  The restaurant is exactly what I want when I go to a high-end joint.  Quiet, dimly lit, and inviting.  They even sometimes have live piano music.\n\nThe best thing I can say about an upscale restaurant is that it knows how to be classy without being snobby.  On one summer trip, I did not plan to go anywhere \"fancy,\" so I did not pack long pants.  I called and asked if I could come in shorts.  Without hesitating, I got this response: \"Yeah, sure, just come in.\"  Hello???  One of my biggest gripes is restaurants that insist you dress up in long pants and a blazer in 110-degree weather.\n\nBut all this would be meaningless if not for the food.  On my first visit, I started with the foie gras, brilliantly accompanied by - get this - a mini pineapple upside down cake!  If you know foie gras, its fatty richness pairs exceptionally well with something sweet and fruity.  This is among the best I ever had.  I was jealous of my friend's gorgeous Caesar salad, plated in an original way I never saw before.  I had it on my second visit, and it was killer.\n\nThough a steakhouse, I have never had a steak here.  I am sure they are great, but I cannot resist their stuffed whole lobster.  At $70.00, it is as good a deal as you can expect at a restaurant like this.  And it is big - and best, it is shelled for you.  The least messy lobster you will ever eat.  The Ritz cracker stuffing - which initially gave me pause - is delicious.  A little melted butter (okay, a lot), some lemon, and a little salt is all you need to put you in lobster nirvana.\n\nIf you are a foodie like me who thinks great steak and lobster are the hallmark of a superior restaurant, you will not regret dining at Charlie Palmer.  Outback this ain't!"

We were running a little late but the hostess greeted us right when we walked up, quickly located our reservation, and escorted us to a table for two.\n\nThe restaurant gives a classic feel - tables dressed in white tablecloth and dim lighting to set an intimate atmosphere.\n\nI wish I remembered our server's name! He provided us menus, waters, and gave some great recommendations. We started off with a bottle of the David Arthur Cabernet (Cab is my personal favorite paired with steak and this Cab was phenomenal!) and took a moment looking over the menu. We wanted to split the Porterhouse for 2 but unfortunately they were sold out for the evening. We decided to go for the NY Strip Steak and a couple sides.\n\nBread basket\n- Came out shortly after our waters. A variety of breads (cornbread, rye, sourdough and others) served with butter. My friendly loved the cornbread!\n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese\n- Strong truffle flavor but that's to be expected - you can never go wrong with Mac & Cheese! Very creamy and delicious\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Spinach\n- Holy sodium overload! For someone who loves salt, this side dish was a bit salty even for me. It was saut\u00e9ed in garlic which gave it a nice flavor, however, the garlic was overpowered by the salt \n\nNY Strip Steak\n- Cooked to perfection. I asked for mine medium and my friend asked for medium rare and the chef cooked the temperature exactly the way we wanted. The meat was incredibly flavorful, tender, and juicy!\n\nOur server stopped by throughout our dinner to check on us which was nice. There were also several others who came by to replenish our waters. What very attentive servers!\n\nOverall I enjoyed Charlie Palmer. I would give 5 stars for the elegant ambiance, excellent service, and juicy NY Steak - 2 stars for the sodium enriched Saut\u00e9ed Spinach. Highly recommend a different side if you decide to dine here!"

It could be we're from Colorado and our expectations of a good steak are higher than your average diner, so I'll give them that. \n\nMy wine glass had leftover lipstick from a prior diner and they did remedy the situation with comping the wine and our dessert.

This has to be one of the best joints in a city loaded up with great restaurants, and a breath of fresh, quiet air to be sure.\n\nSomewhere in my reading about Vegas I came across the \"best restaurant deal in Vegas\", that being a weekly dinner special at Charlie's, which includes the Bottomless Wines. I took advantage of it and concur: BEST DEAL in Vegas. A grand total of 48 bucks for their special which includes weekly curated selection of \"bottomless\" reds and whites. And yes, that's all you care to drink, within reason. \n\nThe chardonnay I had was sublime and insane (Sbraga Ranch), and the red (I was past the remembering point...) was very good. USDA Prime Strip Steak that week, plus the salad, sides, dessert (peach tart) and the wines, all were first class and flavor-loaded.  \n\nThanks to the great wait staff, also quiet and refined.

It was accompanied by a butter poached lobster tail filled with stuffing and succulent lobster meat.\n\nThe dinner also included sides served family style. Both the sweet corn succotash and Russian banana fingerling potatoes were delicious.\n\nRounding out the meal was a creamy, and surprisingly light, citrus cheesecake with pistachio olive oil ice cream.\n\nIt was a great meal in a nice setting, but service was spotty. After being seated, we sat around for a good 10-15 minutes before we flagged a waiter down to take drink orders. After that, service was slightly more attentive, but far from a personalized, engaging experience. There were two waiters for our table and both seemed like they wanted to be elsewhere. It was the start of college football season, so maybe they did. Can't really blame them if that's the case."

The steak was grey on one side and charred on the other. Tasted like it was steamed and not cooked consistently. It was not even good enough quality for steak and eggs at Denny's.  Assistant General Manager Adam Curling couldn't even bring himself to apologize and blamed us.  Waiter gave us the bill and then come over three separate times to see if we paid yet. Most attentive he had been all night. Complained to the hostess about the rude manager and she returned saying we already spoke to the General Manager and he didn't want to speak with us again.

I wish there was an extra \"powerball\" star for those few businesses that deserve beyond 5.\n\nFood was what you want at a five star restaurant.  In our case, we had 30 people mostly ordering filet and lobster tail, and every steak was cooked to perfection.  Everything was served hot.  It was like you get when you go to a top end steak house for a dinner for two, except many more at the same time.  Everything tasted amazing.  The sides were a huge hit.  We had people saying \"i hate Brussels sprouts but please pass them over here so I can have more.\"  I didn't meet the Chef, but, his/her creations were top notch.\n\nIf you are in Vegas, take you special someone here for an unsurpassed experience.  I will be back for sure and I highly recommend.\n\nThe dining staff were as good as it gets.  Attentive, friendly, fast and knowledgeable.  At one point, I thought we had a major pre-planing miscommunication crises, but they resolved it within minutes.  As a patron of many good restaurants, I can attest that the dining staff at Charlie Palmer's are as good as you can get.  In addition, there were a few folks we worked with in planning our event.  These folks are highly professional, responsive, customer focused, and very helpful.  We had a quick pre-planning meeting with the manager the day before the event, and walked away talking about how impressed we were with the experience."

It was interesting at best.  I thought the presentation of the fois gras was not very appetizing.  2.5 stars.\n\nFor the main course, we ordered the bone-in ribeye (we were at a steakhouse!) as well as a salmon dish for our daughter.  The salmon dish was worthy of 3 stars, not bad.  It came out lukewarm, which was okay for my daughter but now other diners would have liked it that way.\n\nThe rib-eye.  We ordered it medium.  The first one came out medium well plus (if you squinted you could see some pink).  It was the first night of our New Year's Eve vacation so we thought we should have it right.  We sent it back (in hindsight, a mistake).  The second one took a long time and when it came out it was rare (not medium rare...rare).  Just to make this wasn't our bias, we asked the manager to come to the table and asked him what he thought the meat temperature was and he said rare.  By this time, we had already eaten the sides, ate a lot of bread (which was actually very good), so didn't want to have the kitchen attempt #3.  The manager was very understanding and took the entree, as well as the other entree and sides off the bill.  All we ended up paying for was a bottle of wine and the appetizer.\n\nThe sides we ordered were brussel sprouts and onion rings.  I would give the brussel sprouts 4.5 stars and the onion rings 2 stars (about the level of a fast food restaurant in both appearance and taste).\n\nThe wine list was not very good.  Only moderate number of selections overall and very few good ones between $75-300.\n\nPretty sad that a upscale steakhouse can't get the meat temperature correct."

Ambiance was relaxed and cozy due in part to the subdued lighting. There were only two other tables of diners when we had arrived. We found it somewhat odd for it to be so quiet on a Friday evening. However, additional patrons arrived toward the end of our meal.\n\nDespite the lack of guests, service was remarkably slow to start. A visit from the Sommelier helped to pass the time while we waited on our menus. Too bad we had no clue what we'd be eating. A variety of breads were delivered to our table and our drink order was finally taken, but we still had not seen a menu. We grew impatient so I dug into the bread, sure enough that's when our waiter appeared with menus in hand.\n\nWe opted to start with citrus prawn cocktail and Caesar bib salad. We selected Filet Mignon and Veal Delmonico as our entrees and chose to share a side of Parmesan potato gratin. We devoured the basket of delicious breads while we waited. The corn bread was particularly notable.\n\nOur appetizers were excellent. The filet was prepared with roasted shallot jus. The Delmonico was served with peppercorn sauce. Both were flavorful and tender. Although, as a matter of personal preference, we rather have sauces served on the side. The potatoes were outstanding; a crisp crust formed across the top and the inside was rich and creamy.\n\nOur bill came to $146. In the end, service was sufficient, but I'd expect a higher caliber from Charlie Palmer and the Four Seasons. Nonetheless, it was a fine meal."

Server was rude and had no clue of the no-corkage Monday promo that is ALL OVER the Charlie Palmer LV website.  Wine sommelier came over and took the rude-level up a notch. Literally told us he would \"allow us\" to drink our wine in the restaurant, and that we are getting charged the corkage fee.  At this point I pulled out my cell phone and showed him the promo.  He came off very defensive and never apologized.  Both employees left us with \"Let me check with my manager.\"  Neither came back to let us know the status of the promo, which in the end was applied. But it's the lack of tact that left us with a bad taste.

As a matter of fact, just about every steak serving establishment can lay claim to winning some \"best\" award from one publication or another at some point.  While I have yet to try out some of the newer acclaimed places like Carnevino or Strip House, my sense is that those places are overly trendy and noisy.  That's why I like Charlie Palmer Steak.  Located at the Four Seasons Hotel, attached to the Mandalay Bay, Palmer's is clubby, quiet and refined.  This is not for the normal Vegas party crowd.  Have a well-crafted cocktail (perhaps a Sidecar or ice cold vodka martini) in the lounge and prepare yourself for an excellent experience.  Service is exceptional, always nearby but never hovering.  I have eaten here half-a-dozen times or more, and the 20oz NY shell steak is my favorite.  Get it with a side of wild mushrooms and the truffle twice-baked potato.  Heaven.\n\nThe wine list is very deep, sharing the same cellar as sister restaurant Aureole upstairs.  Desserts are OK, nothing to write home about."

I loved the soup, which was both delicate and hearty, and the burrata was fresh and tasty. My husband was a huge fan of the fried rice, but because I HATE poached eggs, I took a few small bites and was done. Although we both ordered our steaks medium rare, mine was a little tough. And while I thought the dessert was good, my husband proclaimed it one of the best he's ever eaten -- if only there were a few more of the candied hazelnuts. (Again, I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, so I'm not the best judge.) \n\nAlthough the food was great, the real draw is the unlimited wine pairing. We each had several glasses of the red and a bit of the white. The staff was attentive and not stingy on the refills, which is always a plus when it's \"all you can drink.\"\n\nA side note: Although this was a special menu for Restaurant Week, there's a different 3-course \"Cut of the Week' each week for $48, and it also includes the unlimited wine pairing. So while we will probably wait until the next Restaurant Week to return to Charlie Palmer Steak, we may be back again for another special occasion. Yum!"

Our server had amazing recommendations that really shaped our experience. \n\nDecor was a little outdated, especially considering the rest of the restaurant collection at Mandalay Bay/Four Seasons. \n\nCocktails were perfect. I ordered the El Diablo & it came with a single long ice cube in a Collins glass, literally the way it was meant to. Extremely refreshing! My boyfriend got the Old Fashioned & that was also a hit. \n\nOur food was amazing. I got the filet and my boyfriend got the rib eye. Both steaks came out according to temperature & literally melted in our mouths. Garlic au jus & bearnaise sauce were delightful additions as well as the potato gratin & creamed spinach. I would have liked the potatoes in the au gratin a little less firm & a truffle addition would have been nice. Overall, one of the best steaks I've had in Las Vegas. Dessert menu lacked anything to write home about. We were disappointed that some of the gems people wrote about on Yelp weren't on there (ice cream sandwiches, peanut butter bar, smores bar). Pineapple Upside Down Cake tasted like an dry old fashioned donut with pineapple baked into it. Although, we were given chocolate cookies upon leaving & that did seem to quench our thirst for something sweet. \n\nNot bad for a random Tuesday date night! We loved this place & will definitely return."

            "review": "I ate at Charlie Palmer with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago in July on our last night in Vegas for our date night dinner without the rest of the group. We loved it!! We had booked a reservation and planned on having the \"cut of the week\" prix fixe menu. We were happily surprised to find out that the entree was actually lamb (the description of the prix fixe menu says each week the chef selects a 'unique cut of beef' so we were expecting beef). It was my first time eating lamb so I was happy to try it out. \nThe atmosphere was very nice. I personally love very dark, dimily-lit atmospheres for dinner, and this was the perfect level of subtle lighting that gave it an intimate and warm ambiance. That really has an impact on the whole meal experience for me. \nThe prix fixe meal comes with 'bottomless' wine, a white that comes with the salad, and then a red that comes with the entree. The white that came was a blend of some sort, I can't remember exactly, but I believe something blended with a pinot gris. We definitely liked it. It was refreshing, on the dry side but not overwhelmingly so. I tend to prefer slightly sweeter wines, and I ordered a glass of the Reisling that was available in a glass from another server who was not our main server (in addition to the white) since I thought it would probably be less dry than the white we had. I felt sort of bad ordering a glass of a different white wine in addition to the white that was served to us, so I explained to him that I definitely enjoyed the white we had but also wanted to try their Reisling as well. He was totally understanding of this and didn't act as if it was a stupid request. They also brought a bread basket that had a few different types of warm fresh-tasting bread. Very good, but didn't want to fill up too much and ruin the dinner. The salad was tasty and its presentation was nice. It was basically a round slice cut from a head of iceberg lettuce sitting flat on the plate, dressed with a creamy greek dressing and veggies on top. It had a nice balance of the dressing to crisp veggies and lettuce. Very good palate awakener. \nThe entree was delicious! I loved the lamb! My first time ever trying it and I was very pleased. It was moist and cooked perfectly. The sides were also great! Our sides that night were Israeli couscous and ratatouille. Wow! They were both delicious. The couscous was moist and flavorful and the ratatouille was very flavorful and fresh tasting. The 2 sides complemented eachother very nicely--the creaminess of the couscous with the freshness of the ratatouille. They did bring us the red wine with the entree but I personally can't really handle drinking red wine unless it's organic/sulfite free because of headaches, so I drank very little of it just to try it out. \nWell, we were both stuffed by the end of the meal and I didn't finish my entree. I probably ate about half the lamb portion and I was FULL. Also, the sides were more than enough to satisfy both of us and there was still some leftover that we just couldn't eat. \nThe dessert was the perfect way to end the meal--it was a tiny but flavor-packed lemon tart with a dollop of frozen greek yogurt. Definitely cleansed the palate and left a sweet but fresh taste in my mouth. Great way to round out a delicious dinner. \nThe food was fab, and the atmosphere made this a meal to remember!! And at the price of $48.00 per person, (*especially in Vegas!*) this was a great value for the quality of the food and service we received! Charlie Palmer definitely delivered!"

Ownership and management has changed, and the current establishment is horrible, starting with the wine list, and including the menu and service.  The fillet was inedible...potato gross, service completely lacking.  We had one bottle of wine (over $100) and the server didn't bother to see if we wanted another one.. We typically have at least 3 bottles of wine, and although we thought the wine list to be very thin on quality choices, we would have ordered at least one more bottle if given the opportunity.  Only one person ate their steak...the other 3 were nearly untouched (completely charred on the outside...and dry as an old shoe...no juice or flavor).  Wouldn't you think a high ranking restaurant would notice that 3 diners barely touched their entree?  Would they not want to correct the problem, or at least try to compensate?  Apparently not... My advice...go to any of the at least 100 better establishments in town."

Luckily my husband asked to move so that we could easily enjoy our meal with all the elbow room needed. We started off with the oysters and tuna tartar. Everything was on point and I could have had another half dozen oysters easily. They put just enough salt on the oysters to give it enough flavor. Tuna tartar was great! No stringy bits and it went down pretty smoothly. \n\nI wanted the surf and turf and that is what I got. My filet was pretty dang tender at medium rare and the lobster was good. The ritz cracker stuffing with the lobster wasn't my favorite though. It was really salty. My husband requested his steak to be medium rare as well but it looked like medium well to me. He didn't want to send it back and it was gone by the time I finished so I assumed he enjoyed it somewhat.  The Parmesan potatoes were a bit of a disappointment. It looked delish but the lack of seasoning was a turn off. It just tasted like mashed potatoes with no flavoring and a cheese crust on top. The artichokes were ok. It was nothing worth yelping about. I asked my husband how the sausage tasted in the artichoke and he said that I wouldn't  have enjoyed it. It looked like Vienna sausages from a can. \n\nThe s'mores bar was on the cut of the week menu (which is neat and budget friendly). I asked for that and they made it happen. It wasn't overly sweet and pretty good. The cookie ice cream sandwich was alright. I love soft cookies and I know hard cookies work well with ice cream sandwiches. \n\nOverall service was good. It did take some time for them to pick up my check but they have a lot of people working there. I am just not sure I would choose CP as my go to steakhouse. \n\nPS. The Pom martini was delish!"

It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and my wife declared that it was one of the best steaks she has ever had.  We've tried many dozens of high-end steak houses around the country and specifically in Las Vegas, so that is saying a lot. \n\nI ordered a bone-in dry-aged strip steak, kind of pricey at $54, but also cooked and seasoned perfectly.  \n\nCharlie Palmer also has an excellent wine list although the wine prices are exorbitant, but you'll definitely find a good bottle or two on the list.\n\nBring a shawl or wrap if you are sensitive to a draft and cool temperatures.  The Server told us the hotel \"upstairs\" manages the temp and the restaurant gets the shaft. Nothing can be done to warm things up, apparently. \n\nI recommend Charlie Palmer Steak for a special outing."

Since it was raining when i arrived back in town, and I always wanted to go here, we went to dinner.  There were 3 of us; we all ordered different things.  To be fair, the place is pretty, really pretty, and the staff is nice.  The salads/app's were good, although what they called home made mozzarella cheese tasted store bought, but the heirloom tomatoes were spot on.  My significant other (we'll call him the one who doesn't like to complain) and his niece ordered filets well done, like hockey pucks, so no review there, not fair!  I ordered the porterhouse medium, and asked if it was \"plain grilled\" without sauce or topping, my preference.  My steak came with this thin mushroom sauce and mushrooms on top, which I like, but didn't expect.   Especially after asking.  The meat was good quality (it should have been, it was expensive, I recall $70) We were too full for dessert.  In summary, I thought this place would be better.  Many other choices, although this was certainly convenient located in the 4 seasons.  Not too pricey for 3, with drinks and apps and dinner, no dessert, about $300 without tip.  If you want plain grilled high quality steak try somewhere else.  If you like sauces, etc, this might be for you.  I would have offered 3 stars but for the experience about asking about steak with no sauce and having it appearing with sauce.  I could have returned it, but, i was too tired from the 5-1/2 hour flight.  Hope this helps.  I would even try again."

On our last visit which was Saturday night we noticed a delightful improvement in the overall attention with not only our waiter, wine steward but also the manager, Kirk Perry.  He came over to our table at the beginning of our meal and introduced himself to us and said he would be overseeing every aspect of our dining experience. He checked back with us throughout our meal.   Both my husband and I were so impressed with his caring, professionalism  and above all, personal attention to every detail that evening.  It was my husband's 80th birthday and we were so satisfied that we decided to go here for this very special occasion.  \n\nThe food was elegantly presented, the timing perfect and above all delicious.  We like to take advantage of the Cut of the Week which is a pre-fix menu with wine.  The price at $48. is a bargain.  We get a notice in our E-Mail each Monday so we know what they are offering for this week.  I found out that they also have another pre-fix dinner called Tribute To Michael Jackson for $49.  With that one you have choices with each course.  We look forward to trying that very soon.  If you want to experience an \"Old Vegas Steakhouse\" definitely give this a try."

It was a menu in tribute to Michael Jackson and the Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil show at Mandalay Bay.  \n\nSLOW ROASTED CHICKEN Cauliflower / Hazelnuts / Truffles\nEverything was tiny.  I received a chicken thigh and one piece of broccoflower cut into small pieces.  It wasn't even a full thigh.  It was the size of an organic chicken thigh, not a thigh from say KFC.  The skin was thin and crispy which was nice.  However, it had way too much salt on it.  The meat had an odd rubbery texture that was hard to cut.  It felt like you weren't cutting real chicken.  The sauce was decent.  There were little slivers of truffles on top of the chicken.  The couple next to me ordered the same thing and had their dish split into two plates.  They both received more cauliflower than me.\n\nCHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER BAR Caramel Ice Cream / Dark Chocolate Sauce\nFor a \"bar\", I found it to be lacking in texture.  The whole thing was soft cream except for this thin layer of peanut butter and chocolate at the bottom.  It was razor thin.  There was some chocolate sauce smeared on the plate and a few peanuts on the side.\n\nOur waiters were all over the place.  One dropped a dish.  Another couldn't figure out who ordered a side dish.  After running back and forth for a few minutes, he just left it in the middle of the table for \"anybody who wants it.\"  Luckily, the person who ordered it discovered it was there before people started eating it.  My friend asked for some cracked pepper.  I watched the waiter acknowledge and then walk over to the side to chat with some coworkers.  After a few minutes, she requested the cracked pepper again.  He said he had completely forgot.  Overall, I was not impressed and will not return."

The breads were nicely filling.  We started with the salad, which was fine.  The bibb salad had a buttery flavor and match nicely with the ranch, but it was not particularly memorable.  The sauvignon blanc and the Spanish garnacha that came with the meals were uninspiring wines, and I eshewed a refill.  The filet was tender, but did not have much flavor, no char at all.   Our waiter was gracious in taking back the two miso cods because they were too salty.  When they returned,  they were slightly less salty, but lacked flavor.  It was as if they were marinated too long in miso and were stripped of their natural taste.  The house offered a few complimentary side dishes, which was appreciated, but even those were not quite up to the standards we had expected.  None of the sides were completely eaten, and frankly I don't remember any of them.  The creme brulee was nice, but again not memorable.\n\nThere was a nice small ensemble playing Christmas classics, and they were pretty good.

Our bill came and our waiter told us the manager took off a considerable amount, but not counting the complimentary sides, they took off the miso cods, which was fine.\n\nWe were wowed by our first visits to Charlie Palmer--the quality and taste of the food matched the waiters' professionalism and the pleasing environs, but I have to say I was disappointed by this last visit.

Turning up without a reservation was a bit cheeky as this place is always booked out, but after a friendly conversation we were able to secure a nice table for two. \n\nThe meal was excellent, the wine recommendations both needed and spot on. \n\nOverall a very enjoyable experience though I would definitely recommend booking!"

            "review": "WOW.. Where do I start with Charlie Palmer Steak?? Listen I have to be honest about this place. I was extremely nervous booking my reservation here for my anniversary due to all of the mixed reviews. I was so afraid of not receiving good customer service and from reading the reviews some of the staff has been rude. Well I am here to say that I was fortunate enough to visit them on one of the nights they delivered! I made my reservation for originally 9:00PM through opentable but ended up changing it to 9:15Pm instead! I love that you can modify your own reservations without actually having to call. Upon arriving we were greeted right away from a nice gentleman who seemed to be the manger. He confirmed my reservation and actually gave us the choice of having a booth and sitting next to each other or a table where we would be sitting across! So because it was my anniversary of course we choose the booth to sit next to each other. For starters they brought us two glasses of champagne on the house for our celebration! What a nice gesture! We didn't order any appetizers because my partner ordered off the prix fixe menu which already included a nice salad! Very tasty I might add. The special for that night included a Porterhouse Pork Chop (cooked medium well) and for my dish I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye (Cooked Medium) with a Blue Cheese Fondue on the top. WOW again! I will have to say one of the best steaks I've had and not to mention I do believe it was worth the $60! I have to shout out my server for being so involved and helping the celebration of my anniversary go fabulous! In addition to the chocolate cake that came with the prix fixe menu we were brought some of the sorbet's of all different flavors! Each and every one of them was delicious! All in all I would say that I will be returning on my next big occasion.. or wait maybe even before than! Thanks Charlie Palmer!"

You absolutely can not beat the \"Cut of the Week\" or MJ Tribute deals.  3 course meals with bottomless wine for about $50 from a top notch steak house, unbelievably great.  We started with the sashimi and citrus shrimp apps, which were delicious, although the serving size for the sashimi was rather small.  The soups and salads were perfect and the steak were melt in your mouth tender.\n  The servers were attentive and professional, wines and waters were maintained at full levels.  The atmosphere is nice and quiet, but dark as heck. Turn on your flash if you want pics."

            "review": "I was able to visit Charlie Palmers a couple times on my last trip out to LV and was really happy.  Both times I ordered the \"Cut of the week\" (different weeks though) and it's by far the best deal you will find in LV.  I won't elaborate on what I ate but the simply seasoned salt and pepper ribeye was delicious and the lemon cheesecake dessert I had on the first visit was absolutely light, tart, sweet, and delicious.  The place could use a facelift but it's still one of my favorites.  Try it.. what's the worst thing that could happen??"
