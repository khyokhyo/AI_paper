Why do I want to watch football while eating sushi and sake.\n\n- One thing I have heard good about this place is that it is open late. Until 2-3 ish, when all the famous people come over.\n\n- I'd come here again, but I'll say this is the 3rd time..give me the \"3rd\" time omakase. It seems they have a set menu for the omakase dependant on how many times you have beeb, which i did not like... i thought it was suppose to be more of an improv attitude based on what was fresh that day."

            "review": "Sushi is my favorite type of food, sashimi in particular. What I love about Sen of Japan is the portion of the seafood. Seasoned deliciously. No soy sauce necessary which in my opinion if you have to dip your sushi in soy sauce then you're cheapening the taste and looking to enhance the taste of your sushi. \n\nSen of Japan, by far is the best sushi restaurant in Vegas that has a high end taste."

This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as the owner is a former Nobu chef; a small, pretty well known eatery. If you're looking for fresh fish, great entrees, and a fun environment, check this place out."

Like all the other reviews for this place, I have to agree that the Nobu style is clearly evident in their cuisine. Miso cod! You simply have to have this dish. I had the beef tataki here and it was excellent. The tasting menu is some thing that first timers must have. Food, price, service and atmosphere, this place will not let you down.\n\nSen of Japan gives Nobu a good run for it's money."

I must admit that after a cursory glance at the bare scattering of local Japanese eateries, I was skeptical of finding quality Japanese fare. I'm happy to report that my trip to Sen was the shining highlight of our weeklong trip to Las Vegas! Come for a sumptuous meal at a palatable price.\n\nL A N D\nSen's rendition of a classic smoked duck tataki was divine. You absolutely cannot miss this!\n\nS E A\nAll the basic sashimi selections - yellowtail, albacore, o-toro - were dressed up in ginger, ponzu, lemon juice, and spicy mayo. (Please note that they only serve Hokkaido uni, which is not our preferred source.) Most notable was the grilled black cod soy, which was a deliciously unctuous miso-glazed filet.\n\nS W E E T S\nUnfortunately, our tamago was soggy and overwhelmingly eggy. However, Sen redeemed itself with its molten chocolate souffl\u00e9 with green tea ice cream, silky custard-filled almond yuzu frangipane cake with vanilla ice cream, and green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nWith a $300 dinner tab that could've easily hit double at Kabuto or Yui, this place is a winner in my book for casual-yet-creative takes on Japanese cuisine."

            "review": "I give 3 stars. \n\nJapanese fusion at Sen is pretty good - pretty much the same as Nobu but the half of the price. \n\nBut today, Japanese restaurant business is very competitive in Vegas - people have more experiences than 10 years ago -we all know how to use chopsticks - meaning that Nobu is no longer considered as a great restaurant - its just for yuppies who wanna talk about it to show off,,, that they have $$$. (Tho, all my wealthy friends from Japan think Nobu sucks a lot, that they don't wanna even talk about it).\n\nI am sick of eating sashimi with jalape\u00f1o and kabosu, sashimi with stupid ponzu sauce, etc.\n\nSo, I decided to seat at the sushi counter just to eat traditional sushi.\n\nIt was a big mistake.\n\nThis young sushi chef didn't know what he was doing. He didnt even know the manner. While he was making sushi, he talked a lot,,,. He was even watching baseball game on the fuckin tv screen. \n\nOk, no sushi chef talks when he makes sushi because then it means he is spitting on the food. I was like, shut the fuck up and make sushi. \n\nWatching tv? I mean, no sushi bar in Japan (except ghetto sushi place) has tv,,, they are not supposed to,,, because it is annoying. Sushi is very sensitive in taste. You have to really focus when you eat. \n\nWell, he wasn't a Japanese chef, so maybe he was trained by all-u-can-eat place before he came to Sen. Vegas quality!\n\nSo, my suggestion is to sit at the table and order fusion dishes (3.5stars). But then, I would go to Raku (4stars) or Kyara(3.5stars - with better service) for fusion,,,, meaning there is no point to go back there anymore. \n\nBtw, my standard is high. I give only one star for those all-u-can-eat places. So, regardless of the rudeness, 3stars is pretty ok. I just hope Nakano-San trains chefs,,, like Mr.Miyagi from Karate Kid."

But after a visit to Sen, I was quickly sucked into the hypnotizing world of sushi. I now come here about once or twice a month with my fiance and it is our jam! \nWe don't eat shell fish so I can't vouch for those items, but any of their fish sashimi or negiri is amazinggg. So fresh, CLEAN, tasty, delicate and refined. The albacore is my favorite- feels like a pillow puff in my mouth. \nThe staff is incredible as well. They all have the extensive menus memorized, so attentive and professional.\nTo sum it up, you're getting Nobu quality but better tasting for half the price."

My date did well in leaving the ordering up to the chef. I  was really impressed with everything that the he made for us. The food kept coming and every dish was even better than the last. The fish was so fresh and the flavor combination in every dish was perfect. I'm generally a sushi roll gal, but on this night, it was all about sashimi and nigiri. I don't even look at sushi rolls the same anymore. It was a great experience all around and I highly recommend checking this place out. \n\nThe restaurant is cozy, clean, very nicely decorated and the service was great! If I had the option of adding an extra star, I would.  I will definitely be going back!"

I went late with my boyfriend for a late night dinner and the place wad empty ( should have known right then and there) i ordered a few things and as im eating i swear my waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes. She didnt even give us soy sauce for our rolls and wasabi. (Screaming orgasm sauce? It was the worst ive ever had) anyhow im waiting there for my refill and no waitress for 20 minutes. The place was empty where was she? So i walk towards thw kitchen and i ask someone cleaning for the waitress and he asks me what do i need. Hahaha i need some SERVICE thats what i needed. I told the guy i wanted my check and as soon as i said that the waitress came to my table 3 times in 5 minutes. \n\nI was looking forward to this place but the service turned me off. We were the only table there but she couldnt even give us refills for 20 minutes and made us walk up to the kitchen guy for a refill and our check. \n\nUntil i try again with a different waitress? Its just wasnt worth my money tonight.\n\n---- so i go again after about a month and a half since ive written the first part of this review. Same problem but much more wait. I took my own bottle of water this time so i wont go thirsty. I ordered a few things first and i added a bowl of rice. When she came i asked for a spoon since their rice got choppy cus it was old (i know this cus im asian and know exactly how rice should be) anyhow rice was fine but i just wanted a spoon to eat it with and no joke it took 15 minutes. There was one table other than mine and there were two servers. By the time she came with the spoon it was too late i got tired from the wait.\n\nIt sucks that a place with such good tasting food has such low quality service. Sad tsk tsk."

The chefs have an attention to detail that you will not find at the majority of sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  The quality of the fish is excellent, therefore the focus of the dish is the actual fish (and not the sauce, like other sushi restaurants).  The entire staff takes pride in what they do and it truly shows."

The sushi and sashimi are super fresh and tasty, with some creative sauces and pairings.   Some of the entrees were a miss for me, namely the Filet Mignon with Aspargus in a mustard soy sauce.  Prices are reasonable, definitely worth a trip off the strip if you're visiting."

I cannot believe I have never review this place! \n\nIt is owned buy Sushi Chefs from a fancy place on the strip, they left and created their own.  And oh my they did it right.  The decor is spot on the staff is so incredibly nice, and they almost stand behind you (it seams) to gather your plates.  We like to sit at the sushi bar, so we can talk to the chefs and get the best ideas from them.  They recognize you after a few times and always treat you right weather you are old or new.  \n\nThe fish.  This is not a AYCE.  The cuts of fish are worth the price they are always amazing, my mouth waters as I speak.  If you sit at the bar they will guide you, tell you what is fresh and what is best.  I recommend listening to them and also ordering off the special menu.  It has the most amazing flavor combinations in the world.  I also never NEVER even use a soy sauce, ever since I have been coming.  Most of the Chefs guidance will guide you to the best fish and cuts and styles.  That is why you never need soy sauce, why ruin perfection.  I Japan it is actually disrespectful to use a soy sauce on anything you make.  It is considered a art and a highly respected art."

            "review": "Wonderful nigiri and sashimi, very interesting (in a good way!) sushi rolls. \nI hated doing the \"vendor dinner\" thing for work, until I started bringing them to Sen. Now all my vendors ask to go there. These guys are from San Antonio, Denver, New York, Boston and LA. All cities with great food, and they all love Sen of Japan. I've never had a dish at Sen I didn't like, and most I absolutely love. \nNot a huge Saki fan, but I did discover one that I love. It's a sparkling Saki. A lower alcohol treat that goes really well with the Hawaiian Edamame and spicy sushis. \nDuring the \"family dinner hour\" it can be tough to get a table right away if there is more than 4 of you, but make a reservation even a couple hours early and you'll get in. \nAlso helps to have a little patience, and fun company, if you do like I do and ask them to bring \"whatever the sushi chef feels like creating\". It's a blast and a super fun way to try all kinds of fun food concoctions. \nIt's not a cheap meal, but far less expensive (and better!) than the schmancy places on the strip. Enjoy!"

At one point I think I even hid my excitement with a napkin to avoid creepy stares. Whoever thought to experiment with kiwi, mango, and other exotic fruits along with sushi should be given a Nobel Peace Prize(yes, it's that important)\n\nSadly, my second visit wasn't as good even though the food was just as delicious. We ended up going for the late night happy hour and when we arrived we were the only people there. We tried a shrimp tempura and orange appetizer along with the delicious black cod lettuce wraps which were off the charts tasty. The only problem with our dining experience was the fact that one of my rolls basically took 30+ minutes and I was given no explanation and our waitress didn't even offer any compensation for a 30 minute wait. I really wanted to give my first experience 5+ stars and my 2nd experience 3 stars so I guess 4 is where I'm at."

            "review": "So - this place is about a 10-15 min cab ride from the strip (which = about  $20 + tip). Some background:  We are big sushi fans and regularly try to find great sushi places after her trip to Japan.  I in a previous life, used to manage a great japanese restaurant and worked with authentic Japanese chefs for a while. I've eaten at high-end japanese restaurants in many different cities (Nobu, Hiro, Masa, etc....).\n\nSummary: Go!  This is te best sushi and japanese cuisine I've had anywhere.  This is not the typical sushi joint, nor is the typical high-end japanese restaurant, it is low-key - with a focus on great food.  Our Server John also became my second favourite server in the world (yes - the world!).  The Hot kitchen chef is previously from Nobu.   Pricing is entirely reasonable and cheap compared to the strip.  Spend the taxi fare to get here and rationalize it like this:  Nobu on the strip for a similar meal would be around $400 or so...here it is $150 (incl $60 bottle of Sake).    The restaurant decor is certainly nothing like Nobu, but is clean and relatively modern and is perfectly fine for a nice date - but if you impress people based on fancy decor rather than taste - you're going to the wrong place by coming here (I agree with previous reviewer: the TV is out of place behind the sushi bar).\n\nDetails: John is an awesome, friendly server with great background knowledge who also suggested a great bottle of Daiginjo style cold Sake.  We didn't go Omakase, but John was our guide to the menu that night - based on our preferences he suggested several dishes that all ended up being delicious.\n\nTempura was great - not too greasy, good amount of batter.\nSushi - each had it's own\"secret\" sauce...great pairing.\nFish - all very fresh.  O-Toro was superb (unlike previous comments), yellowtail was very good (had red flesh elements), maguro had an interesting twist of Jalapeno pepper and a fried garlic chip (ummm!).  Also they had several selections of fish/cuts that aren't available or on the menu of most restaurants (awabi, Kanpachi, Chu-Toro, O-toro...etc)\nEntree - The Black Cod Miso dish with Foie gras was rated very highly by my foie-gras-mad-girlfriend. \nMakis - Great selection, and the curry spiced shrimp tempura was delish.\n\nMost other sushi places have something like 12 ingredients they are working from to create \"new\" makis (ie: cucumber, lettuce, mayo, spicy  sauce, eel sauce, tempura bits, and some other ingredients)....resulting in some unsurprising variations in their rolls.  Sen of Japan must have something like 30+ ingredients they use to mix it up....resulting in some tasty and interesting flavour combos.  (ie: japanese curry + red onions + tuna+ tempura shrimp).\n\nI've never written as effusive of a yelp review before, but that's really because I haven't had this good of a japanese meal in a while...so it is well deserved.  We had already decided we will be going back whenever we're back in Vegas before we left the restaurant!\n\nScrew Nobu, Wazuzu, etc.  They are overpriced and the fish isn't even THAT great there (had some so-so tuna and toro).  Spend your evening at an off-the-strip place and get some serenity....\n\nALSO - Call a cab about 20 mins before you want to head back into town....or ask the cabbie who drops you off for his phone number."

She and I eat a lot of the same foods and enjoy spice, but she was happy with the flavors. So maybe I was on a off night. LOL I would hit again"

            "review": "We were in search of an authentic sushi bar where they serve high  quality fresh omasake menu owned by a Japanese sushi chef but knew that none would exist on the vegas strip.  After all, Vegas isn't exactly known for sushi.  I found Sen of Japan on Yelp and noticed their high rating from 60 reviewers and voted as the best sushi restaurant in Vegas by Zagat.   Well, worth the try!!  \n\nThis place is around 10 minutes away from the Vegas strip.  We sat on the sushi bar and ordered the Omakase.  Our sushi chef's name was Sunny.  I would have to give him 5 stars for excellent service.  He was very attentive and worked quickly to serve not just our dinner but also the orders he had to full fill from other customers.   \n\nThe sashimi were all nicely plated and were topped with different garish on each fish.  The layout of every dish was so pretty but the taste was even better.  I loved the way they prepared the rice where it was perfectly moist and wet.  Some places gives you a glob of dry rice that ruins the whole experience.  \n\nOmasake was $55-$85 per person depending on how much you wanted to eat.  I was full when I reached the $55 mark.  After the last toro fish, I felt content.  \n\nLA offers higher quality sushi places but for being Vegas, it was good enough for me to rate them at least 4 stars.  \n\nIf I were in Vegas again, I'd come back here. If you're sick of all those typical hotel buffets, go try Sen of Japan.  I don't recommend ANY sushi restaurant on the strip.  Those are catered to non asian customers who don't know the difference between sushi or sashimi and are content with previously  frozen fish."

            "review": "After hearing and reading the much touted reviews of Sen of Japan the wife and I had to go there on our last trip to Vegas. Yes, we have heard that the head chef here was the former head chef at Nobu, yes we heard that Andre Agassi likes to eat here. \n\nBut talk is cheap. We set out to find out for ourselves.\n\nLocated about 6 miles away from The Strip, Sen sits a bit unassuming within a local shopping plaza.  Upon entering, we were even more surprised by the somewhat austere layout.  But that is probably why they can sell an omakase for $55 and $80.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and asked us if it was our first omakase here.  Apparently, if you have had it before, they give you different selections - awesome!  He also gave us an introduction to each course.\n\nThey were as follows:\n\nyellowtail with yuzu and jalapeno - wonderful citrus notes and soft tender yellowtail.  Jalapeno added a nice touch and was very mild in heat.\n\nkumamoto oysters with ponzu - very creamy and soft, with a delicate finish\n\nsashimi salad with yellowtail, tuna, and salmon.  Spring greens gave a nice contrast and the dressing seemed to be a sort of soy vinaigrette - a nice light tartness.  All the fish was fresh.\n\nSeafood spring roll - filled with crab and halibut, and topped with tobiko caviar.  This was deep fried and had a nice light crunch.  But the meld of the seafood made it a bit generic with the real crab inside getting a bit lost.  But still tasty.\n\nBraised black cod with seared Hudson Valley foie gras - a nice contrast of flavors, but the textures did not make a great complement.  The cod was ultra tender and foie gras was less so.  Not the best foie gras I have had, but to be fair, it was at French Laundry.\n\nFilet mignon was cooked perfectly and so very tender.\n\nClam miso soup - the normally mundane miso soup was transformed into something extraordinary.  The clam provided a flavor profile that can only be described as a match made in heaven with the miso.  Best miso soup I have ever had.\n\nAssorted sushi - big eye tuna, scallop, fluke, young yellowtail, sweet shrimp, and snapper with a kiwi based sauce.  All the sushi was so fresh and delightful.  The kiwi based sauce was a nice touch and very unique.\n\nAt this point, everything that we had was so good we decided to go over the top and add two more items.\n\nWe ordered a roll that had crab, mango on the inside  topped with salmon, shrimp curry sauce, and diced red onion.  As far as rolls go, this was a wonderful change of pace to the standard mayo-creamy rolls that glut the sushi places.  Real crab melded with sweet mango combined for a very harmonious pairing and the salmon with curry sauce on top completed the entire pan-Asia tropical theme.  \n\nThen the coup de grace was the o-toro.  Most places just serve toro, but some places like Sen, distinguish between chu toro and o-toro.  They are both from the belly of the tuna (tuna's equivalent of bacon), but the o-toro lies further from the muscles and hence more fat marbled in.  It is a much lighter shade of pink.  The sushi literally melted in my mouth, I did not need to even chew.  If I had dentures, i would have gummed it and it still would have been tender.  It can only be described as heaven on earth. \n\nDessert consisted of a almond frangipane cake with pineapple sorbet and chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream. The frangipane had a nice light almond flavor and pineapple sorbet was a soothing complement.  The chocolate souffle though was a bit doughy and resembled more of a lava cake since it lacked the delicacy of a souffle.\n\nOverall, the meal we had here represented an unbelievable value.  It would be easy to pay twice as much on The Strip and not be half as good.  The only negative point I would say is that the omakase consisted of flavor points too similar.  With yuzu, ponzu, and other similar acidic-salty tastes, there was little need for any soy sauce, but it also had the adverse affect of being a bit tiresome on the palate.  But this is just a slight technicality, all items were top notch, regardless.  Definitely a place that we will frequent on future trips.\n\nBest Thing - o-toro and clam miso soup"

But this is something that's been a long time coming and I'm finally breaking.  \n\nI arrived, was greeted, and sat for almost ten minutes with no menu or beverage.  I SHOULD have walked out.  Waitress finally comes, takes my drink order, brings my drink, takes my order, and leaves me with no napkin, chopsticks, soy sauce, etc.  \n\nWhile I was waiting, a couple came in and waited fifteen minutes to get a menu and be told, \"Kitchen closes in fifteen minutes so last call is in five minutes.\"\n\nThe food is well-prepared, the late-night happy hour is a great deal, but for what?  To sit around for half an hour for your appetizer?  The poor girl was so swamped since she \"HAD\" to cut a server at midnight so it was just her lone self running around, taking care of nine different orders.  It took fifteen minutes for my beverage and she completely forgot my edamame.\n\nThis isn't anything new, though.  Usually I sit at the bar and eat sushi and service is okay because I have the chefs in front of me.  But sitting at a table?  Forget it.  Service was just terrible.  Never again.  No more late night Sen of Japan.\n\n\nEDIT: ALSO!  Be forewarned that this place may just randomly close at will.  I've seen them close up shop at 12:30am on a non-Sunday, so if you're going, hoping to see if you can squeeze in - CALL FIRST and save yourself the frustration."

It was, for the most part, underwhelming: a forgettable sashimi salad, a lackluster lobster salad, and something else that I forgot about.\n\nThe black cod \"soy\" (sound familiar?..hmmm...) was very well done and had tons of flavor. What's more it was topped with a nice fatty piece of foie gras which accentuated the already rich flavors of the miso...OOPS...I mean \"soy\" glaze. The dish also had a drizzle of wasabi sauce which cut through some of that richness.\n\nThe main course was a barely grilled (looked almost poached) filet mignon with a miso dressing. The sauce was good, but the filet lacked seasoning and didn't have much flavor to speak of.\n\nThe best part about this place is the nigiri. The fish is, of course, fresh, but the garnishes are so unique and so beautifully executed that I completely forgot about the disappointing previous dishes. Yuzu with garlic, truffle oil and chopped chile, etc. Really good stuff.\n\nA cheap knock off of Nobu is still a compliment in my eyes, but this place is much more than that. Nice work guys. I'll be back soon."

            "review": "There's only a handful of Sushi Restaurants & Bars that are worth going to and it is a NIGHTMARE to traverse the minefield of, 'dead fish on bed of broken dreams' bilge  and 'what you call sushi,  I call a bad bowel movement' fusion rolls with sushi menu lists longer than the Bible (Roll over and get out of me already Roll)....\n\n  And going to the Strip can be a disparaging experience;  first of all, the transient slag can be obnoxious and utterly annoying-leaving all manners behind the minute they step off that plane.  And the looks of abject ennui / annoyance from the staff, either giving you condescending looks because they think you're an ignorant tourist, or trying to buddy up with you and being totally unprofessional, (I'm still trying to figure out if all that chummy conversation's for a better tip, if they're just high or completely incoherent)...\n\n  Being an independently run business in Vegas can be rough; first, you have to compete with the Casinos, (who have unlimited resources and budgets to produce the most mundane mediocrity at exorbitant prices) and then the local environment can be pretty desolate.  As is the case with Sen, it's located in a commercial center, which in its definition, reeks of banal modularity.  The front facade won't be on the cover of Restaurant Victim's Quarterly, nor will the inside win any interior design awards anytime soon.  But it's dark and moody in a semi-Japanese minimalist way, which is better than an over worked, over designed, venus fly trap of laser cut metal panels and lucite curved walls.....\n\nThe head chef/owner Hiro Nakano left Nobu at the Hard Rock to open up Sen, winning Best Japanese restaurant in the US in 2008 from Zagats as well as a recommendation from the Michelin Guide.  And most importantly, Sen is not outrageously expensive, considering the quality of fish that Mr. Nakano is able to procure.\n\nWe like to start off every meal with a little app, and here we had the Assorted Japanese Pickled Vegetables, (cuz we need more salt in our diet)! and a Cucumber Salad in Vinegar and Lemon. We also had a little bit of Sake (pronounce sa-KEH, not saki, please).  We ordered the Sake Flight-three glasses of various distilling methods that encompass the spectrum from light to full body.  Starting with the Junmai -Otokoyama from Hokkaido, the Nigori (unfiltered Sake) is the Momokawa Pearl. And finally, a Daiginjo: Hakutsuru Sho Une. I had a particular affinity to the Nigori, it had a great texture and complimented the Sushi. The Junmi was very light which was good with the lighter fishes but kinda petered out when it came to the oilier, heavier ones.  The Daiginjo was really bold (fire breathing dragon bold) and was akin to rocket fuel Grappa.  Smooth tho......\n\nSO if it's your first time to Sen, I DO recommend the Omakase Course, it's the Chef''s choice selection of Sushi that is innovative, creative and delectable.  To call it fusion would be an insult, however, it is a diversion from traditional sushi flavor profiles. For most sushi, Soy Sauce is not necessary, the Chef brushes specific Soy Sauces to each Fish served, as well as various condiments to supplement its natural flavor, (jalape\u00f1o, ginger, micro greens, capers and scallions). Sen serves one of the few Western-Japanese hybrid cuisines that is flavor wise, successful and in very good taste (no spicy mayo globs here).\n\nWe got the Wild Shrimp Tempura, Apple and Inariage (seasoned fried bean curd) Roll with Tuna, Salmon, Mango, Micro greens and a Balsamic drizzle- it looked gorgeous!!!  With the Apple, Mango and Balsamic - it was on the sweeter side, but good nonetheless.\n\n We ordered Sushi a La Carte and it was delicious (Rick's words...such the poet).... It was superlative; mouthwatering and fresh, we relished every bite.  Starting from the lighter fishes, we had the Tai with Scallions and then the Hirame with Capers.  we had the Maguro, the Hamachi and Saba afterwards.  being a little too elated, I forgot what condiments were on the Maguro, but it was good enough.   I loved the Hamachi with the Jalpeno, and Saba is always my favorite of the silver skinned bluefish....\n\nThe waitress said they had the Shima-Aji in today, (another blue fish favorite) it's got a little more refined tasted than Makerel, but still a robust fish that is satisfying.\n\nWe ordered the Unagi, which is just yummy with the sweetened Soy Glaze.  And we ordered the Uni (Sea Urchin) which is an acquired taste, (Rick is slowly getting used to the texture and briny flavor-even I admit in the beginning, it was like taking a gulp of sea water and sucking on a barnacle.. I was a kid then).  It was pretty fresh, Rick and I thoroughly enjoyed all our Sushi items.\n\nAlso, Sen has a full non Sushi Menu-so if you are a Sushi enthusiast, or just looking for a great Japanese Restaurant, Sen of Japan will not disappoint you!!  And having eaten at all of the Sushi restaurants along the Strip, we will go as far to say that this is one of the Best!"

I'm not a local so I had to rely on Yelp and other websites to find a good place to eat but I really didn't want to go to a non-Japanese owned sushi place.  Many of you won't probably notice but for us, from Japan, we can tasted the difference, especially the sushi rice.  Still, I couldn't spend too much money knowing how much I eat, I needed to find a place that is reasonable.  Sen of Sushi's website was one of the few websites that had prices on their menu.  Their nigiri prices were about the average so I've decided to try.  It was a bit of drive from the Strip but it was easy to find.\n\nPlace was smaller than I expected and I sat down in front of the head chef for the day (not the owner/chef).  They did not have two items that I was hoping to get, ankimo and sea urchin.  But they had Kumamoto Oysters which were good.  Overall, the fish was very fresh and everything was good.  The chef suggested some of their fish of the season but most of them were white fish which I really don't care for.  Many special nigiri he recommended were seasoned with ponzu.  They were not bad but I prefer more oily fatty taste so that was a bit of disappointment but that's just my personal taste preference, nothing was wrong at all.  \n\nI've ordered one large sake, miso soup and their chocolate cake dessert and the tab came about $60.  It was a bit cheaper than I expected.  I would like to try other places in Vegas, but this place was very good.  I will definitely go back."

Didn't feel like paying exorbitant prices on the strip so we yelped and up came Sen of Japan. \n\nThe two of us started out ordering sushi (Nigiri mostly) off the menu and then we decided to switch over to Omakase (This is when you leave it up to the sushi chef as to what he serves you) which was the best decision!!  We didn't want any  food from the kitchen so we had the option of Nigiri or Sashimi and were able to switch it up between courses. \n\nWe were served approx 5 pieces of Nigiri or Sashimi for each round and the plates were presented so beautifully with simple and complex flavors (fingerling limes, red wine vinaigrette, yuzu ponzu, etc) .  There was even an order in which to eat the sushi.  Our taste buds experienced something truly magical that night.  We have never had flavor profiles like that and the experience was like nothing else we have experienced.  The fish was also very fresh.  \n\nPrices were extremely reasonable!! I'd even say cheap!  This will be a staple on every Vegas Trip.  You locals are so lucky to have this place nearby!"

Started off with popcorn shrimp with orange Aioli sauce, Black miso cod with butter lettuce, Fresh water eel roll, Black snapper sushi, #1 roll spicy albacore with tuna and spicy garlic ponzu and finished up with house made red bean ice cream.

It was pretty busy, and busier than their norm, so the service was lacking, but the sushi was amazing!  Definitely on par with the sushi restaurants on the strip.  I heard before that the owner was the head sushi chef at nobu and it definitely shows.  A lot of the menu items are almost identical to nobu's menu.  But I didn't mind that at all since nobu is my fav!  However, soj goes further outside of the box with their menu.  For sushi lovers I would definitely recommend the shin's special plate.  It was amazing! Delicate, beautiful, fresh pieces of assorted sushi each topped with a special sauce.  I would also recommend the yellowtail and salmon in spicy ponzu sauce.It was beautiful and delicious as well.  We also had the Hawaiian style edamame, too salty for me, uni, not the best I've had, but not the worst!  Spicy tuna handrolls, amazing. Oysters with salsa, amazing. Tempura, really good. And chocolate cake with green tea icecream for dessert, identical to the bento box dessert at nobu! \nOverall a great meal, will go back again soon."

The waitress Tiffany had the menu locked down and for someone who was not familiar with this type of food she knew what I would like and aced it. The GM was dropping by regularly to make sure we were taken care of by the staff and check on the quality of the food. Now for the food, it is hard to say anything could have been better the sashimi was so fresh you could have dropped it in water and it would have swam away. The rolls were world class rolled to perfection and OMG fresh.

Started with the yellowtail sashimi, very flavorful, and a great start....then we had sashimi salad with garlic ponzu, it was okay, not an item that stood out...next we had black cod soy, which was a split decision between my love and I... it had a slimey texture for him, while I enjoyed it...i think it had a good balance with the sweetness and the miso...the filet mignon was decent, but I think I'm a bit spoiled with steak, hence I might be an unfair judge, its decent, but not something I'd eat again at this restuarant...the final dish that came out was a dish of assorted nigiri sushi with two pieces of tuna roll at the end... i think out of all the dishes we had, this was the most disasppointing, the wasabi under the fish for the nigiri was a bit too heavy, which would of been okay if it was fresh made wasabi like Kagaya in LA, but it wasn't, therefore it was just a overpowering addition to the sushi..\n\nThe fish overall, I would rate it around a 3.5, since good tuna melts in your mouth, and salmon should be sweet without any other additional sauces for flavoring, hence why they only received 3.5 stars for the fish....\n\nFOOD = 3.5 stars\nFOOD & Service = 4 stars, the chefs were definitely fun to chit chat with..."

We were not disappointed.  Sen combines sushi (extraordinary fish) with a bistro - which we didn't sample - but it's nice to know it's there.  No foie gras during our visit.\n\nFrom the 'usual' starter, hamachi sashimi, the chef suggested a special digression nearly transparent yellowtail, dressed with razor-sliced chili pepper, garlic flake and cilantro leaf, I was on a 'journey' directed by our chef.  Maguro tuna followed for grounding, then 'house smoked salmon' with remarkable subtlety and texture.  Aji (horse mackerel), hotate (scallop) and hirame (fluke) with special dressings spared the wasabe and soy dipping action.\n\nInventive, thoughtful and humble describes the sushi chef demeanor at Sen.  No broad-stroke arrogance to a \"gaigin\" lacking knowledge.  Having scoured the streets of Tokyo, Osaka and other cities in Japan for over 30 years, the attitude detector is sensitive.  I'm pleased to recommend Sen for both taste and value.  Not at all an AYCE spot, but their unwritten policy of \"no gouging\" is appreciated.  You won't be disappointed.  Let the chef be your guide."

Around 6:30-7PM my wife and I were graciously greater by the gal who seated us right away across their beautiful sushi bar and the sounds of simple yet hip music being played in the background. A few minutes later the manager Nick came over where I introduced myself and my wife and told him we were from LA, read their reviews as it was our first time there and we didn't want to be unhappy like we were from the night before. Nick has excellent customer service skills and gave a run down of their menu, how it is served, and the uniqueness of their selection of fresh fish. On top of that he said to keep room for their special chocolate shuffle with homemade green tea ice cream desert as it was on the house since we mentioned YELP.  \nWe looked at the menu to find items that stood and different from what we have found at other sushi places. The items we choose were fresh wild salmon sushi with mango puree (also available as sashimi with mango puree) Fresh wild shrimp tempura with apple slices topped with a hint of mango sauce, fresh black snapper sushi, fresh blue crab, chicken yaki skewer their special fried avocado appetizer and our standby favorite rainbow roll.

I found my new favorite late night place and it's close to home for me.  Woo hoo!\n\n The service was fantastic too!  Tomoyo was very personable,  knowledgeable, and attentive. Everything she recommended was very very good! \n\n I eat a lot of Japanese food around town so I think it's safe to say I have a lot to compare with hehe. I like this place also because it's a bit of fusion. There are a few menus to choose from late night.  So we ordered away . EVERYTHING we had was incredibly fresh and extremely delicious!  Some items we ordered....\n\nPeppered albacore on the specials menu. Gotta try this if you're a fan of these two things.  Try it if you're not.  It comes with a butter sauce. The texture was so soft. It almost melts in your mouth. \n\nAsari (clam) miso soup.  It came with a few clams in their shell.  Very fresh and full of flavor. The clams really complemented their miso soup.\n\nTamago sushi. You can tell a lot about a sushi place just by their tamago. Made in house and it was the right balance of sweet for the egg,  very fluffy.  They do it right. \n\nKamasu nigiri.  Japanese barracuda.  On special guys., I don't see this too often.  Served with fresh wasabi olive oil. Incredible!  Soft in texture. Very fresh. I would highly recommend this if you like to try different nigiri or fish. \n\nA few from late night happy hour menu:\n\nBlack cod lettuce cups.  Come on I couldn't pass this up after all you yelpers talked so highly of it.  And yes. It was as good as everyone says it is.  Must try.  Nice and light and packed with flavor. \n\nTempura shrimp with orange aioli.  I'm not usually big on the mayo dishes but this was good.  It came cut into pieces and tossed in an orange aioli. Also had mandarin oranges in there, nice touch. \n\nSalmon carpaccio.  Wow! Buttery and super fresh pieces of salmon lightly seared on one side.  My picture down there was of it half eaten.  It's a great value on the happy hour menu.  Try it if you like salmon!\n\nWe ordered much more than this! And we LOVED everything. (See receipt pic)\n\nDesserts were pretty epic! Out of the two we tried, both made in house ( see pics below) my favorite was the almond flanjipan with pineapple sorbet and mountain peach. It was hot and very moist.  reminded me of a pineapple upside down cake and flavored with almond extract. The tart sorbet balanced the sweetness of the cake.  Very well thought out dessert and flavor combination. \nI love how they offer mochi ice cream from Bubbies, Hawaii.  I'm from there and this is a popular local company back home. They make really great flavors. \n\nHad a great dinner and can't wait to come back again to explore and try more things on the menus! Hopefully I can catch our same server."

But then, try to order some other dishes too.  The h1n1-4 was awesome .  We went there for late night meals with happy hour plates.  The lettuce wrap was the bomb, a must have.  The calamari tempura was great.  The salmon carpaccio was to die for....I guess I was listing just about everything I ate there was great.\n\nHighly recommend it.  The chef was very friendly.  Service was top notch"

Sen of Japan, quite simply is! \n\nYellow tail belly was perfect, Tai served two ways was great, Shima aji, Kanpachi, Toro, all worthy of 5 stars.  The rice was slightly overcooked, but still the best in Vegas. \n\nIf you like sushi the way that I do, and you are in Las Vegas, there is no other choice. I know, you're in Vegas and you need everything to be way over the top, and taking a cab to end up at some regular strip mall doesn't sound fantastic...but for me it's all about the food. \n\nI know there is a real Japanese sushi bar in every city, it just takes time and patience to uncover them! Yelp is a good resource to help find them, but the problem is many of the highly rated places are so Americanized that it can be misleading.   I don't like rolls!"

            "review": "After reading the reviews here, I was quite excited to go. My experience was probably lackluster at best however.. I'm not exactly a novice to sushi either, having enjoyed the most fresh sashimi from Japan. \n\nI went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and assuming that it would be quite busy, we made a reservation at 7. When we got there (which was at least 10 minutes before 7), we saw a group of three without a reservation get their seats before us. The more infuriating part is that we had to wait for 15-20 minutes to get a seat even though we had a reservation!! It was pretty priceless to see the faces of the waiters when they realized that they had sat a group without a reservation before us, but they did nothing about it. \n\nThe service went downhill from there. It was almost laughable how poor the service was. We had to ask several times to just refill our water once. The wait for each dish was about 30 minutes each, which is absolutely unacceptable in my opinion, especially when you are waiting for sashimi dish that was so small! I have seen better sushi chefs cut bigger, more professional, and fresher pieces of fish that filled a plate 5x bigger than that size in 15 minutes. \n\nAs for the food, I will say that it was not horrible but it was not great either. We had cod lettuce wraps (taken off the menu now but they said they still made them) because my boyfriend raved about them. I thought that they were just okay. There was a crunchy topping reminiscent of fish bones that made the whole dish pretty unpleasant... \n\nThe other dish we had (which I cannot remember the name exactly because their website does not work..) was tempura with orange slices and mushrooms. I found the combination to be absolutely revolting and hard to swallow. I consider myself to be very open about eating strange foods (i.e. will eat anything), but for a dish that was not even that strange, this was just gross. \n\nOverall, I think this place is extremely overpriced, especially for poor service and just okay food. I think the idea of this restaurant is pretty good but put into action, not so much."

In fact, it might just be my fav sushi spot period.  \n\nLocated in a non-descript strip mall on desert inn ( across from TC's Rib Crib and It's a grind - that place was hoppin' last night )  - it's a simple, clean, comfortable restaurant.  The service is top-notch.  Twice, i dropped my napkin on the floor and twice the server was there with a fresh napkin before i could blink an eye.\n\nWe decided to go large  - the $85/ person omakase. - 3 cold courses, 2 hot courses and dessert.\n\nstarted with a couple oysters topped with a sweet onion salsa and then a yellowtail with a daikon and fried green  onion filling - both were very fresh, refreshing.  the gf and i are usually not fans of oysters - we're having 2nd thoughts.\n\nnext up - a sashimi salad with an amazing light, citrus-y dressing - the sashimi included ahi tuna, salmon and scallop -  the flavor buds are dancin' now !\n\n1st hot dish - lobster with a lemon grass sauce - lobster was lightly grilled - the sauce - lemon-y, but it did not have that thai -influenced flavor i expected when lemongrass is used.\n\nNext up - seared filet mignon with crisp  sweet potato / potato shavings and asparagus with a mustard sauce - holy cow , perfect tenderness, the mustard was not too heavy - all good !\n\nthe last cold dish - sushi - salmon, shrimp, yellow tail, mako and a couple pieces of ahi roll.  The yellowtail and mako - awesome.  a little disappointed that they include boring shrimp - it was good though.\nalso included a coup of miso and clam soup - great.\n\nfinished with a molten chocolate cake and green tea ice cream.  chocolate molten cake never gets old for me - it has some unusual spicing in it - i forgot to ask the server what was in it - had a slight spice to it, but i don't think it was a pepper source.  \n\nI was saddened to see how little biz they had when we were there - i hope it was just a slow night because this place is a gem."

Thank you once again for your delightful company. You have to know that I was stuffed to much contentment, I should probably feel guilty about it. This couple, my fellow yelpers, are buddies from school I've gotten to know better over the months and setting aside any possible bias I have for them, I gotta admit (and you will too if you come here) that Jo is quite the chef! \n\nThe night began on a more exotic note: Hawaiian Spicy Edamame, followed by one order of the spider rolls and another of the shrimp tempura rolls. Both were of decent sizes, enough to fill your stomach up halfway. I especially admired that little touch of mango on the spider roll. \n\nAnd everything only crescendo'd from there. We then had the Calamari with Jalapeno Salt which was 'succulent' - a word I would never have seen myself associate calamari with, fyi - and that's a compliment, because the sauce/topping that was sprinkled on top of each calamari gave it a vinegary taste, a unique alternative to the usual tartar sauce. There was also the mixed seafood with apple vinaigrette although I must swiftly move on to pinpoint the highlight of the night - the Chocolate Souffle with green tea ice-cream. All concerns regarding weight loss and a possible diet regime disappeared as soon as it got to our table, I tell ya! I probably don't even have to go on and speak in awe of this dessert for you to know that Veronica and I loved it to tidbits! \n\nWill definitely keep this restaurant on my list of go-back-tos. It had a cozy atmosphere, dimly lit with candles, perfect for long talks or a cute date night. The staff was very friendly (props to you Kayla) and I couldn't quite forget the lightning tearing up the sky in the background that night - all while we were talking about ghost stories too! \n\nFancy that."

Eel with scallop, I can't think of a much better combination, so I went with it.. It was good but lacking something?.. something that would give it that edge for praise..\n\nBlack Cod Soy: filet of fish, served with a pepper on top, nice presentation and every slice just flaked off. Had a sweet, mild wine flavor.. Not as common as the usual usual salmon/tuna.. I'm used to but it satisfied. \n\nHalibut with Truffle Sashimi: This was suggested by the chef behind the bar counter. When he mentioned Halibut, I was sold, then he mentioned truffle and truffle oil.. I started salivating.. 2 super thin slices of halbiut, a couple truffle nuggets on top and a drizzle truffle oil.. 6 Stars, easy!!\n\nAtmosphere was live (at least at the bar) and the japanese sophisticated clean decor paired with their menu offerings nicely. Service was Awesome and Prices were reasonable. Keeping in mind all the other Japanese restaurants out there for comparison, that are laying down some serious food, I feel this place is just short of a 5 star review from this dining experience alone.."

We had the $55 omakaze tasting menu (#1 of 4 from what I'm told).  I see the others have already listed the dishes served with the omakaze #1 so I won't bore you with the details of each dish, I'll just make a couple comments.\n\nYellowtail with jalapenos and sashimi salad were excellent, very fresh fish.  Miso cod, I'm kinda over this dish (probably had it once too many times at Nobu) but they do execute it very well here.  Filet Mignon - unexpected but solid.  Mixed sushi - nice to be able to sample all their fish - I liked the hamachi and salmon a lot but absolutely loved the halibut.  I felt the cake and ice cream were uninspired and the cake not that good.  Also a little heavy to end that meal with.  \n\nYou must must must order the uni here.  If you've never had uni before this is the place to try it for your first time.  I thought I'd had good uni before but this was head and shoulders above the rest.\n\n$55/man with two people tax and tip plus the order of uni it was $160, not cheap but half the price of Nobu Hard Rock and imo a much better meal.\n\nI will report back when I return for omakazes #2 - #4.

Most items were from the menu.\n\nThe best thing out of several courses was the black cod, and although the fish was stellar, the fois gras was a bit chewy. \n\nThe filet was lackluster, lobster came with a strange sauce, and nothing really stood out. One of the courses was a sushi platter with a plain tuna roll. Seriously? The fish was sliced incredibly thin and narrowly. \n\nI could have put that dessert together with stuff from Trader Joe's. \n\nNormally, I care much more about food than ambiance, but I do not like the vibe here at all. It is not welcoming/comfortable/elegant/unique, and the giant tv behind the sushi bar is seriously annoying. The chef was very professional, but seemed insincere. Our servers were great, though.\n\n**UPDATE** I was just contacted and questioned about my review. \"Were you on drugs?\" No, but I wish I were, as it might have been a better experience!\n\nI grew up in SF and had my first sushi in grade school. I've enjoyed amazing and horrible meals in dives and 5-stars, food carts and Michelin-rated restaurants all over the world. \n\nI am not questioning the quality of the fish. I just thought that the idea of omakase is to get something special that is NOT on the menu, and a tuna roll as a course is a sad joke...\n\nI was actually depressed for a few days after this let-down. I was expecting the Per Se of sushi. For almost $300 for two people, I should have been floating on air after the meal. Instead, I was deflated.\n\nDon't believe the hype...\n\nCheers~"

The waitress that served us was very knowledgable about the menu items, and she said she has built up that knowledge from the fairly long length of time she has been working at Sen of Japan.  And from the thoughtful way she is able to recommend items on the menu for us to try, to knowing what additional ingredients that are served in each item (not mentioned anywhere in the menu description), you can tell she is a top notch gourmet restaurant waitperson.\n\nBut with the HH pricing Monday - Saturday from 10:30pm to 1:30am, you can order enough food to satisfy your stomach and still leave with a reasonable tab.\n\nThe Fresh Salmon Carpaccio Style is absolutely a must try.  It is sliced thin and seared quickly and served with a sesame ponzu sauce garnished with fried mizuna.\n\nThe Black Cod with Butter Lettuce Wrap was also very excellent.\n\nThe Red Snapper Nigiri was very fresh and tasty.\n\nThe Sweet Balsamic Chicken sounds interesting, but I felt the sweet soy sauce overpowered the balsamic reduction, and rendered it almost like your average teriyaki chicken.  Except the chicken was cooked perfectly, and it would have made an excellent Chicken Teriyaki at any Japanese restaurant.\n\nThe Fried Shrimp with Orange Aioli was good. But the most interesting part of the dish is the Orange Aioli, which gets its heat from Sambal Oleke, and would undoubtedly make an excellent dipping sauce with perfectly fried calamaris.\n\nThis restaurant is perfect for a special date or an excuse to treat yourself.  Come for the HH to explore the menu, and return to check out more items that are sure to please your palette."

It's cheaper and just as good.\nIf you want good Japanese food, go to Raku.  It's also cheaper, and probably better.\n\nNow, if you're looking for an upscale-esque, \"cool\" Japanese sushi place that serves to the \"cool\" white-collar businessmen, with an overpriced menu that reminds you of a dining experience on the strip, while not being on the strip, then \"sen of Japan\" is definitely for you.\n\nENJOY"

But the quality of the food - in this case their sushi - is not on the same level. \n\nI've been to Nobu and Matsuhisa. I can see that Sen of Japan tries to emulate these gems, unfortunately they can only go as far as the list on the menu. Words such as foi gras or truffles don't impress me much if the simplest dish can't even be prepared decently.\n\nDuring my visit, the fish was fresh but the sushi rice, the base of the word \"Sushi\" itself, can't even go unnoticed as being a decent or even standard. The rice was dry, it fell apart even as you tried to lift the nigiri or the rolls. Barely tasted the sweet vinegar infused in the grain, the rice was rather chewy, a bit like sweet rice (sticky rice).  \n\nThe fish slices are quite thin. I thought with sushi you suppose to eat and taste the flavor of the fish, with rice as accompaniment not the other way around??\n\nAs usual I ordered a spicy tuna handroll - to see how they manage spiciness with fresh fish. I always give credit for trying to be creative, but only praise when the creativity was done right. A handroll is a handroll. Its shape is a basic cone and people usually put their creativity in its presentation. I just don't get it when I saw the handroll that looked like a sushi roll gone wrong. Perhaps by mistake they made a mini sushi roll and then realized that the order was actually for a handroll? It was a flatten cylindrical shape with a small piece of rectangular seaweed to cap the bottom of the roll. 2 pieces of seaweed to make a handroll alone already rolled my eyes. Top that with soggy seaweed, a handroll that looks like a patch-up job, spicy tuna that's so salty I could not taste the fish at all, can't even see the fish as well for it was so finely mashed the mixture was a pretty color of pink. The prominent taste was only that of the mayo and chili sauce. The tuna/mayo paste was very soft, the little patch of seaweed that plug the end of the roll could not contain it.\n\nAgedashi tofu, the deep fried slightly battered tofu, took so long to come out. It supposed to be an appetizer, but it came out at the end of the meal, despite our inquiry to the waitress (twice). When it came, the batter was so thick and hard it was rather tough to puncture with the chopstick. I was expecting a silken texture of the tofu, instead I got a rough hard tofu that not just crack under my chopsticks, it tasted dry and tasteless. Not a good texture to feel on your tongue, \n\nDo I dare order anything else after that? I think not... So, 2 stars. One for the place and one for the people."

The seafood salad was good, the filet mignonette and the cod were fine, but the rest was a blur.  For that, I won't order this prix-fix menu again.\nMy friend ordered the omakase from the sushi bar, in which the chef picked out the sashimi or rolls for you.  All the fish that we had were heavenly.  The toro was the best.\nI want to take more people here again."

They must use liquid nitrogen in their batter or something because the result is tempura that is amazingly crisp and light.  Truth be told I came here for sushi, but the kambocha pumpkin tempura really stole the show.  \n\nOne tempura dish that was horrible however, was the shrimp tempura with orange aioli.  The dish arrived with chopped pieces of shrimp tempura that were absolutely saturated, soaked, and drenched in a deluge of mayonnaise.  Combined with the oil from the deep frying, this dish was nearly sickening.\n\nIn terms of the sushi, it was very good but not mind-blowing.  With all the glowing reviews I was expecting to see the heavens to open up and hear angels singing the Hallelujah chorus, but alas that did not happen.  The hamachi was good, as were the salmon skin roll, and the California roll made with real crab.  Unfortunately, the chu toro at $10 was a disappointment.  Normally, chu toro will make me pause and cause my eyes to roll back as I savor each buttery bite.  Not so much this time.  \n\nAll in all my experienced was mixed, but I'm willing to give them another chance to try their omakase."

We had asked for the freshest fish of the day and were promptly advised which ROLLS to try. Which I promptly gave our standard reply of No, Thank You. We only like Sashimi, what is your freshest fish of the day? Which again perplexes the Sushi Chef, luckily the chef working the other side of the bar jumped in and advised us to try the Halibut. \n\nOnce the issue of no rolls only sashimi was worked out I was referred to an area on the menu where they had Sashimi plates (about 8 total) which fit our needs. To say the food was spectacular would be a stretch, it seemed fresh enough but the difficulty in ordering was quite annoying and for the prices the sashimi plates were lacking. \n\nAll in all, ok Sushi joint but yes overrated. For about the same money we could go back to Hachi at Red Rock http://www.yelp.com/biz/hachi-las-vegas , which really had a nice spin Sashimi and that trendy vibe you sometimes are willing to pay extra for. \n\nBut so far for our weekly sushi fix, we are really liking Wayne's Sushi Bar http://www.yelp.com/biz/waynes-sushi-bar-las-vegas \nHe's funny to hang with and he has quite a few dishes that are phenomenal, and we didn't even have to order.

Also heard this from some friends of mine who go there.  They Always say there are no tables, even when there are more than 3 empty.  Don't get me wrong it's a busy restaurant, and they've only been outright rude once.  It's just that so often we sit at the bar and no one ever comes for the tables during our 90 minute dinner.

It went down smooth....almost too smooth. :)     We ordered a couple of big bottles of beer as well.\n\nOur favorite roll, the #17 -- Spicy Spider Roll -- Yum!    As we ate it we thought \"Where is the spipce\"....but then, a minute or so after eating the first piece, we felt the nice afterburn. \n\nWe had both the Albacore Salad and the Sashimi Salad; we really enjoyed them both.   Too bad the Albacore Salad didn't have as much sashimi as the sashimi salad; nonetheless it was damn tasty.\n\nThe salmon sashimi was quite buttery and tasty as well.\n\nI tried a black cod appetizer in a lettuce leaf.... it reminded me of a savory fish taco where lettuce was used in lieu of a tortilla.  Thumbs up again.\n\nPlace was a rock solid 5 until our last two orders.   \nWe tried the special Kanpachi nigiri (with a garlic chip), of which neither of us cared for the texture of the fish.   We also tried the #1 roll, which was a bit disapppointing when it came to flavors.   Neither were bad, but they didn't hold a candle to the flavors and textures of stuff we had prior.\n\nTaking the last two orders into account along with the $116 pre-tip price tag, the place finished out as a very solid 4.5 stars.  And I am hit with the Yelper's dilemma, to round up or down:  I choose because of the excellent server and sushi chef who really made it an enjoyable time!\n\nAs Arnold famously said \"I'll be back!\""

Anything with yellowtail there is incredible and so is the filet mignon tataki. The giant maki rolls, especially ones with cooked elements, are hit or miss. They're showy and trying to give customers lots of variety, but it's overarching and tends to either miss the mark or just be a jumble of flavors that don't always work well together. The #16 roll (salmon tempura roll with seared scallops in mayo sauce) is a prime example. It was pretty bad.\n\nOne friend who wasn't a fan of sushi but came along in the group ordered the filet mignon citrus soy and offered me a bit. The steak itself was good, but it was drowned in a goopy almost sickly sweet sauce that reminded me of bad teriyaki. A terrible thing to do to a fine cut of beef.\n\nAs far as sushi restaurants in Vegas go, you could certainly do far worse. The quality is good overall and prices are reasonable for the food and experience. It's worth a try if you're visiting and want to go off Strip for dinner, if you're a local living on the Westside, it's a near-must. \n\nI'll likely return again, but now I know which dishes to probably stick to, and which ones I shouldn't bother with."

But well worth the travel.  And if you are a Nobu fan, you've gotta try this place.  Oh, and after eating here, you'll know whey they are Michelin rated!\n\nHighly recommend the $55 Omakase tasting menu.  We must of had 7 different dishes.  The amazing part was that everyone at our table didn't have the tasting menu, yet the food was sync'd between the tasters & non tasters.  We all had food at the same time, so people weren't waiting around.\nThe tasting menu was just delicious.  Visually stunning and delicious.\n\nIf you have the tasting menu, you have to tell the waitress how many times you had it before.  This way, they can change the menu for you.  Apparently, they have 4 tasting menus. After the 4th trip, then its chef's choice.\n\nSen of Japan was so good, we went twice in a weekend!"

The servers are very knowledgeable with the menu and are always so cheerful. :) My drink is always refilled promptly and I am checked up on to make sure all is well at the table  but never to the point of being overbearing. \nThe food is absolutely AMAZING. This is why I continue to come back aside from the great service.  The food is consistently good. I think the food is so unique with the raw fish having garnishes and sauces created by Chef Shinji and the kitchen food is great and I feel that I cannot get the same kind of food anywhere else. These are my favorites:\n1. The mushroom salad is so delicious. There is a variety of mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in butter and yuzu. \n2. Nebayaki Udon. I love the broth and the egg is cooked so perfectly; I can't get over it! I love the bean curd and the portion of the vegetables as well in this scrumptious soup. \n3. Black cod lettuce wraps. I love the way the black cod is marinated. I know other places have miso black cod but the one here definitely has the most unique marinade and goes great with the kataiffi in a small snack sized bite in the piece of butter lettuce. \n4. Scallop with spicy lime nigiri. I am not the biggest fan of raw scallops but the combination of the red onions, micro cilantro, and the spicy lime dressing make the raw scallops taste so great. This is a must try if you come here!\n5. Salmon spicy style nigiri. The salmon literally melts in your mouth. The bonito flakes and the spicy ponzu sauce is a well thought out combination. \n6. The home made chocolate souffl\u00e9!!!!! By default it comes with home made green tea ice cream which my wife really loves,  however I enjoy it with the home made vanilla bean ice cream. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 is perfect for the chocolate lovers like myself. It takes around 15 minutes or so for it to prepare but it is absolutely worth it! \nThese are my favorites but there has not been a single dish that I have not enjoyed here. Lotus shrimp is also a great piece created by Chef Shinji. :) \nI have not tried that many rolls because I always want to save room for more food,  but as far as I have tried I really love the #19 roll, which is the yellowtail and yellowtail roll with yuzu soy. I plan to come back another time and try the spicy salmon tacos created by Chef Jae.\nHAPPY EATING :D"

The T.V. at the sushi bar is fun for sporting events if you are just going to grab some sushi with a friend or with your boyfriend etc., etc. And it is a great place to take people that don't eat sushi because they have an entire menu of cooked food.

This was my second visit, so I thought it was best to dine with the Omakase menu.\n\nJohn was our waiter, ask for him when you go.  He is knowledgable and just a genuinely nice person.  The national championship game was on the tv behind the bar, so I had everything I needed for a great meal.\n\nWe opted for the $85 Omakase, which was 7 courses:\n\nKanpachi sashimi with Oysters - \n\nLike Butta!  Smooth and succulent, the kanpachi was served with a dash of ponzu, fried garlic chip, and micro greens.  The oyster was served with a garlic slaw of sorts.  The oyster was flavorful and light, and a great way to start the meal.\n\nSashimi Salad w/ spinach and micro greens - \n\nTender and delicious cuts of salmon, tuna, and red snapper nestled around a bed of spinach and micro greens with a light vinaigrette.   This dish was fine, but forgettable.  The sashimi was cut very small, which affected the presentation a little bit, but the flavors and quality still shined through.\n\nFried Fish Eggroll - \n\nThis wasn't an egg roll at all, but I am lost for words to name it.  This was various fish, not sure what wrapped in a shiso leaf and fried topped with tobiko.  A little dry and my least favorite bite of the night, but it was very creative.\n\nBaked Black Cod in a soy sauce topped with foie gras and a shiso pepper - \n\nBest dish all night.  The cod was perfectly cooked to retain some moisture and finished in a light soy sauce.  The foie on top made the fish even more decedant.  The chef nailed this one, it was an evolution of flavors with each bite, and I wanted more.\n\nFilet in mustard ginger sauce - \nCooked closer to medium than medium rare, this dish was executed well.  Nice amounts of salt and the right amount of mustard, let the beef shine through instead of other flavors.  \n\nVarious nigiri - \nTuna, Salmon, Kanpachi, Ebi, Snapper.  All delicious and perfect.  I didn't even use soy sauce with these, it just felt wrong since the fish was of such high integrity.\n\nDessert - Chocolate souflee with homemade green tea ice cream - \nGreat soufle, the chocolate oozed out as my fork pierced the fluffy cake.  The green tea ice cream was made with matcha and complimented the bitterweet chocolate in the soufle wonderfully.  I was so full at this point two bites was all I could handle.\n\n\nSen of Japan is close to being perfect.  It provides great individualized service, superior quality product, and creative execution."

What it doesn't have is food to match.  \n\nOur party of five was eager to try what was purportedly one of the best sushi restaurants in town.  We drove all the way from Hendo - in rush hour traffic - just to eat here.  On the way, we decided that we should do the omakase and let the chef put his best foot forward.  Here's what was served:\n\n1.  Yellowtail with peppers and garlic chip - the presentation was wonderful, but the flavors were overpowering.  The ponzu was too strong for such a subtle fish.  The addition of garlic and a spicy habanero (or jalapeno?) just kills any chance you can taste the fish, let alone feel the texture of it while your mouth burns.  \n\n2.  Mizuna salad with salmon, tuna and albacore - This would have been a nice dish, had it come before the spice of the yellowtail.  In fact, this is how good, fresh fish should be served: with very little detraction.  As an individual dish, however, I'd rather just have thick cuts of sashimi instead of thin cuts of fish with a salad on the side.  \n\n3.  Soy Miso Block Cod - really good execution of one of my favorites.  Only downside was that I didn't have a bowl of rice to go with it.  By itself, it was supremely tasty and buttery.\n\n4.  Fliet Mignon tataki - this was good and tender, but lost in sauce.  Fliet has zero flavor profile, so covering it with any sauce really just makes the meat a sauce delivery vehicle.  Chalk it up to personal preference. Also a personal preference: I would really have liked it to be medium RARE rather than medium well.  \n\n5.  Miso soup with clams - delicious.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The combination of clams and miso just hit the rights notes or flavor and smell.  Really good stuff.  I could have just had a couple bowls of this with miso cod and called it a night.\n\n6.  Nigiri - The fish looked and tasted fresh, but the texture of the salmon was slightly mushy.  The rice was really good, with just the right about of koshi that makes me happy.  +1 for the rice.\n\n7.  Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream - I love green tea ice cream and this didn't disappoint.  The souffle, however, was another matter.  It was hard and nowhere near as fluffy or light as it should be.  IMHO, if you offer it on your menu, you need to execute it well or don't bother.\n\nBeing hungry after all that, we ordered two additional rolls:\n\n8.  #24 (Shrimp tempura with tuna on top with pineapple wasabi) - This is one of my least favorite rolls...ever.  The sushi itself probably was good, but the sauce killed any chance me wanting to take another bite.  It was too sweet and too much of it all over the roll.  \n\n9.  #25 California roll with soft shell crab - this one at once pretty good and also fairly standard.  I'd probably choose this if I didn't know what else to try.\n\nI liked this place, but it's a tough sell at 4 stars.  Out of 9 items, only 2 stood out as things I would make it a point to order again.  \n\nI've read the reviews.  I've heard the raves.  I finally tried Sen.  I just don't get what the fuss is all about."

I don't remember much of what we ate because we only took suggestions from the chef. Everything came out perfect, flavor was out of this world and the black cod lettuce wraps? YUM!

I've never been here and most of us girls haven't, but Christina was a regular.\n\nMiso black cod lettuce wrap had good flavor and the fish was nicely cooked. Only thing was the fish was piping hot so maybe rest so it doesn't sear the lettuce. \n\nCalamari oriental salsa- calamari was tender but only 4 pieces. I liked the bright citrusy salsa on this. \n\nShrimp tempura orange aioli - this was similar to something I had at Nobu and was crunchy while with a creamysweet and tangy sauce. I think this was my favorite out of the HH items I ordered. \n\nBlack snapper nigiri - the sauce overpowered it. It was too sweet for garlic soy.\n\nEel roll - I just wanted something simple and this was standard, but good. \n\nSpicy salmon roll - again, just wanted something simple but the salmon in this was delicious. \n\nChristina kept trying to feed me some of the nigiri she ordered and some of them were amazing. The giant clam and kanpachi and lean tuna was among the stand outs. \n\nI was so so full. I think the price to quality ratio is pretty good here as I enjoyed my meal quite a bit. \n\nThe service was pretty decent. My drink was refilled in a timely manner, plates were cleared and most of our food rolled to our table fairly swiftly. \n\nI didn't come here because I just figured it would be just alright and I'm not in this area often so I didn't come out my way to dine. However, this was a really positive experience so I will probably be coming in soon with the fiance and see what he thinks. I liked it quite a bit though."

Who in the world is open at midnight?  Lots of places in Chinatown.  Except I was lazy to drive out further.  \n\nSurprisingly not too far away, Sen of Japan is open til 1:30am!  Whaaaat... Yeah let's go!  Omgosh look - its across MadHouse Coffee.  Could be a great thing... :D\n\nHappy hour menu til 1:30 too???!  I like these kinda surprises!  What's to order:\n- Baked Escolar is baked super white tuna w/jalapeno pesto sauce topped w/pumpkin tempura red pepper corn.  This is superb!  One of the fancier items on their HH menu.  It's small but powered with flavor!\n- Cut sushi rolls like Spicy scallop, Alaska roll topped w/seared salmon, and freshwater eel.  Okay maybe you have to have a thing for these choices.  The flavor was a little different than just simple nigiri sushi.  But suggesting to at least try em out.  Eel was my fave.\n- No.1 spicy albacore top tuna was something we ordered first, but it came out second to last.  Irony? Yes and it was just okay.  Not number one for me.  They didn't save the best for last... It was different.  I would've preferred plain unfancy nigiri for both the albacore and tuna separately.\n- Salmon carpaccio was the absolute last served to our table.  And this hit homerun for my taste buds.  This definitely I would order again!\n\nThe interior is really clean and proper as you would expect a typical Japanese restaurant to appear.  Check out their sake collection!  Huge sake bottles lining a countertop and stored in their ref.  Nice ambience and cool music, though not traditional music.  \n\nService was pretty professional for a late night meal.  So impressed with how the dishes were explained by the young man; even how he hand gestured to point palm up and detail the ingredients.  Wait...was he the chef?!"

The reason for this update is that sadly, I do have to agree with some of the yelpers who have said that customer service was bad here.  \n\nMy husband and I usually sit at the bar, but sometimes we come in when it is pretty crowded and have no choice but to sit at a table. This was the case during our last visit. No big deal, we are regulars here, so we understand that on some days, if we don't come in around the time that they open, there will be no open seats at the bar.  The problem was that customer service was not great like it usually is for us. I think our waitress was new because I have never seen her before, and most of the staff already knows who we are. She was not very attentive. She took a while to refill our drinks and because she did not check up on us, we had to wait a long time to put in our second round of orders for sushi. Thank god the waiter who knew us stopped by our table to help us! We also noticed that if you order sushi, they service the customers who sit at the bar first, which also explains why we experienced a longer wait time. There was also a family sitting in back of us who was complaining about not getting their food. We wanted to order dessert, but decided not to because we didn't want to spend another 30 minutes (or who knows how long) in the restaurant. \n\nSo the bottom line is this: if you want good service, sit at the bar! Get there early or right when they open at 5pm. All the sushi chefs are great, but I think my boy Sonny is the best!!"

I got the $55 omakase so I could experience a selection of Japanese food and not order a roll or two and be stuffed.\n\nMy omakase is just as others have described.  Course 1 - yellowtail with garlic and peppers.  Course 2 - Mizuna salad with tuna, salmon, a wonderful dressing and some capers for added flavor.  Course 3 - Black cod with a soy miso glaze.  The fish was very flaky and delicious.  Course 4 - filet mignon done medium rare.  I would have liked rarer but it was very good.  Course 5 - Assorted nigiri and a bowl of steaming hot clam soup.  The nigiri was quite good and the clam soup was excellent! Course 6 - I had a choice and I took the chocolate souffl\u00e9 with a scoop of green tea ice cream with a mint sprig.\n\nI enjoyed the meal and I left not having a stuffed feeling of having eaten too much.  I was going to get the more expensive omakase, but my server steered me away from that because some of the ingredients--lobster and foie gras--were not available.  That was an honesty I like.  \n\nI would have rated this dinner 3.5 stars, but I rounded it to 4 based on the great servers who were most gracious, attentive, and pleasant."

It is a bit expensive, especially if you opt for the foie gras add-on. Ahh...I found something I do not like...whoops! The foie gras. (I love foie gras!) The add-on foie gras is tiny and is an additional ~$14. And when I had it, it was not cooked well, nor paired well. I think they should take it off the menu until they can prepare it better.

Luckily they like to share so got a chance to try their food, the soft shell crab roll was to die for along with Ellen F's spicy tuna.\n\nOK so apparently the sushi here is a good size compared to other joints that offer AYCE, when I do the AYCE at other restaurants the rolls are tiny.

The atmosphere was cool.\n\nThe verdict - outstanding sushi - meh everything else - you have to really be in the mood for sushi given the drive.\n\nSmiley face"

The food is simply ---insert any uplifting adjective synonymous with good, spectacular, awesome, amazing---!  It is a bit off the strip but it is a find when you get there.  Go with a big group and give this place as much business as you can.  It deserves it and you will all have a blast getting loaded up on the saki and the meal, whoah.  Wonderous.  And here is a tip, if you went to Vegas and forgot to make reservations for a place to have a good meal, just come here.  Just be forewarned, once you eat here, Japanese food will never be the same anywhere else."

Yes, there may be better places in LA or San Francisco or even Japan, but for Vegas, it was great.   \n\nWhen soy sauce is not needed for sashimi, it speaks volumes about the taste of the fish and the complementing garnishments.\n\nMy menu for the night:\n-Yellowtail Tar Tar (~$10)- had this unique wasabi soy sauce sorbet \n-Filet mignon tataki- thinly sliced in a light sauce\n- #23 roll (~$15)- Spider roll topped spicy tuna- the crab had a nice flavor to the batter\n\n-Shin specialty platter ($20)- 7 types of sashimi, each with it's own complementing garnish; now that's labor intensive to prepare individual pieces\n\nOne of my favorites dishes oddly enough was the Calamari with Jalapeno Salt (~$10). It was served on top with a light dressed spinach salad.  The calamari was just so soft.  It was between a squid and white fish texture- very tender. \n\nI would stay away from their \"skewered items\".  We had the combination skeweres ($9.50)- chicken, beef, veggie and scallop.  Heavily sauced and just plain.  Definitely not even close to Raku standards for skewers. \n\nAll in all- great experience.  Outstanding service.  We sat at the bar and had the Chef Shin talking to us the whole time."

Mostly they're closer to the strip in China Town and Spring Mountain area, but here is Sen on Desert Inn. You wouldn't think much of it from the outside and the surrounding shopping plaza, but it is actually quite a nice restaurant. Great local spot for Summerlin, Sen offers the usual cuisine at a slightly higher price. They have an ok Happy Hour late night, but there are a bunch of better places just 10 more minutes down the road. It's not my favorite sushi spot, but it's quality."

Everything I ate was on the suggestions of the chefs, except one spicy tuna roll (great) I ate as filler, it was all superb.  \n\nSecond off the rice was perfect, it has that perfect balance of sticking together just enough until you bite it, when it bursts apart in your mouth.  The seasoning was spot on for me, just sweet enough so you can taste it but not overwhelming.  \n\nThird off, THE SERVICE WAS HANDS DOWN THE BEST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A SUSHI RESTAURANT.  I always hear about this fantasy world where you have a local sushi bar where you have a relationship with the chef, he gives you the best stuff they have, you trust him to serve you, and you like it.  In reality every time in the past when I have asked what is fresh today I get back, \"It's all fresh\", bull crap!  Well folks I found it, literally everyone i saw at the bar knew the chefs and the chefs knew them.  A regular group came in for a birthday and sat at the bar and said, \"wow\" me and take your time.  Even by the time I left all the chefs knew my name and visa versa.  This place is legit,  I was handed mackerel nigiri that was sauced and had some garnish and he told me \"no soy sauce\".  I mean thats fuking awesome, I am not mad because I don't like being told what or how to eat.  You go to a good sushi bar to have a chef prepare you food, not just for food (make sense?).  In other terms, don't fuk around, he knows more than you do so do what he says, you will thank HIM for it.\n\nGo to this place for fish not rolls.  If you order cal roll and shrimp temp roll and some other roll crap with cream cheese covered in eel and ponzu sauce and dunk it in a bowl of wasabi with a splash of soy sauce this place isn't going to stand out in my opinion.  For that type of thing selection is key as long the fish is pretty good.  The prices here are a little steep to be eating fried cream cheese monstrosities.  \n\nNigiri 5-7\n\nBasic rolls 6-8\n\nSpecial rolls 12-14"

I am up here visiting my parents and my dad loves to go out for sushi when we come up. We normally go to a  different place but saw some good reviews so we thought we would give it a try. The place is clean and presents itself well.  Our server was attentive and took decent care of us. \nWhile that is great I go out to sushi for FISH.  While it was fresh, the proportions were terribly small, to the extent that we were joking about it. The fish was sliced really thin, you could almost see through it. The premium sashimi plates (30 bucks apiece) we ordered, once again, had decent quality but such limited quantity, it was very disappointing. Lots of rice in the rolls. Not kidding, we spent a considerable amount for dinner and on the way home stopped at another place as we were still hungry.  \nThe night before we had sushi of equal quality (we had gone to Ohjah, close by) but spent a lot less (still not cheap, but way more reasonable) and were quite satisfied with the experience.   I really wonder what people are comparing this place to when they are rating this place so high."

            "review": "What sets Sen of Japan apart from Momo Sushi, I Love Sushi, Sushi Fever, and hm, all other sushi places I absolutely love in Vegas, is its crunch.  Momo offers a yellowtail sashimi dish with cilantro, jalepeno and soy/citrus ponzu, but Sen adds a crispy little garlic piece on top. I'll pay the extra 75 cents for that type of perfection. As another example, Sen makes the traditional spider roll but theirs is skinnier. You can order it with spicy tuna on top (number 23 on the menu). What's special is that the spicy tuna doesn't overpower the spider and, again, the spider has a little extra crunch-- carrot --that sets it apart from all other spicy spiders. \n\nPlus, Sen offers much more than sushi. The filet mignon tataki was an unusual treat. The citrusy soy sauce on top the thinly sliced, perfectly undercooked beef made me feel less guilty than I should have with that dish. The flavors were all very well-balanced (just like my Riesling!). We also tried the yellowtail tar tar, which you mix at the table with a little caviar and a wasabi soy sorbet. \n\nTop all that off with great service and I think Sen of Japan is my new favorite restaurant in town.\n\nWith two glasses of wine, 1 large Sapporo, and about 4 really outstanding dishes, our bill came to $85 without tip. So Sen is a bit pricier than all my other favorite spots, but it's worth it."

Although I was at the sushi bar, the waitress who served drinks and edamame was actually fantastic.\n\nWhy only 2 stars then?  Funny you should ask.\n\nWhile sitting at the sushi bar watching one of the chef's prepare someone else's nigiri, I happened to catch him proceed to throw the fish down on the preparation surface to flatten it a couple times, and then some error in trajectory resulted in the 3rd throw landing on the floor in front of him.  He picked it up, washed it off in the sink, looked right at me, and then laid it neatly across a rice ball.  It went onto a plate with several others and off to a table it went.  Call me crazy, but there is no 5 second rule in restaurants!  Washing it off doesn't change that rule!\n\nSo, a few minutes later, while conversing with my dinner partner, the same chef, who appeared to be more tenured or the ranking official behind the sushi bar, called out to the waitress behind us and scolded her abruptly about a customer waiting for a to-go order.  She happened to be directly behind me and not only was it rude and inappropriate to do so in front of customers, but it totally stopped our dinner conversation dead in it's tracks.  She responded that it was being taken care of and went about her business.  I think I just sat there with a dumbfounded look on my face.\n\nSufficed to say, there are many excellent sushi choices in Las Vegas.  I prefer one that takes values sanitary practices in preparation of the food and where the staff is a little more pleasant to one another.\n\nThis will likely be my first and last visit to this establishment."

I don't think they expected the prices to be as high as they are at Sen so they proceeded to order almost nothing and wasted the chef's time with all sorts of requests for extra sauce here and this and that.  I couldn't keep it straight.  The chef responded by being totally rude to them.  Stuff like \"I thought you were gonna order more\" and answering questions with one word and walking away shaking his head.  They eventually made up a reason to return one of the rolls (The crab in the california roll wasn't cold.  It was room temperature?  Where are we?  The Safeway sushi aisle?)\n\nIn any case, on to the food.  Really excellent quality meal.  I loved every moment of it.  Let's get to it.\n\nCod lettuce wrap - one of the best things I've had.  Cod was super tender and flavorful which contrasted nicely with the crisp lettuce.  Super flavorful and delicious.\nJapanese pork - don't think this was pork belly even though it was as tender as belly.  Believe it's a braised piece of the shoulder.  In any case, all the parts of the pork were super tender and melted in your mouth.  Served with a wonderful sauce.  It was pricey but I could eat like 10 of those.\nSnapper nigiri - very nice.\nJapanese lasagna - I probably should have skipped this as it's more of an American type roll.  It was good....but compared to the really clean flavors of the other dishes it tasted too unbalanced and rich.  Forgot what was on it since the cream cheese overwhelmed the roll.  They kind of warned me against it in a very subtle way but I must have missed it.\nSalmon carpaccio - raw pieces of delicious salmon topped with a heated sauce that slightly cooks the salmon.  The salmon flavor was wonderful and it had enough fattiness to make the dish really come alive.  Highly recommended.\n\nThing about this place I love is the fatty dishes have enough acid in the sauce or preparation to cut through the rich taste so it evolves into something even better.  The pork was fairly fatty but the sauce was so perfect with it that you didn't feel gross eating the pork.  Love this place and their \"reverse happy hour\" and will definitely return.\n\nGrouchy Chef - cheer up dude.  Seriously, the guy is hilarious but God knows how many customers this guy is costing them with his behavior."

They served me all the fancy top-graded stuff from appetizer to dessert: hamachi, oysters, sashimi salad, red snapper, cod, foie gras, steak, nigiri, and molten chocolate cake. From the beginning to the end, every dish was equally mouth watering. The service was top-notched. Everyone from the chefs, the managers, and the waitresses was extremely nice and helpful. I felt so happy when I left the place. I wish I could bring this place and Raku back home with me. ARIGATO, Sen of Japan."

            "review": "Scam of japan. We were fed lies! I'm going to go ahead and swim against the tide on this one. This is not the first time that the ever so promising 4.5 star raving-review-average has steered us wrong. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got here right at 10:30pm for the late night happy hour. The manager, who also happened to be the host sat us immediately and the server came up to us right away and took our order. Everything started off perfectly. \n\nThen came the wait. There were 3 sushi chefs on duty and the restaurant was far from full, but there was a decent wait time. I was in a fit of hunger, so we flagged down our waiter (who was sweeping) and asked him to add in 2 orders of miso soup, so that we can have while we wait for our food. He said sure and then went back to sweeping. (He was slow as molasses!) I kept thinking to myself, The food is going to come out before he ends up putting in the order for the miso soup - and what do you know, I was right. After some more waiting and looking around nervously, out comes our sushi orders and then the (slow as a slug) miso soup comes. Now, the annoyance of this was short lived and it was all forgivable (I was just crabby since I was hungry). \n\nThe deal breaker for us was that the happy hour rolls we ordered were beyond basic. I could get better sushi rolls from a buffet on the strip! We ordered the HH No.2 roll and the Lisa Lisa roll. Sadly, they didn't even give us the right roll. Instead of the recommended Lisa Lisa roll, we were served the unagi roll. We ate it anyways since we didn't know any better (and I was starving). Hey, I get it, mistakes happen. But they were crazy basic, bland, and boring. They were not impressive or memorable. Both rolls were exceptionally dry and one noted. A plastic, chemical flavor permeated the garlic ponzu sauce, possibly from the container it was sitting in. \n\nThe worst dishes we ordered had to of been the miso soup and the salmon carpaccio. Although we loved how the miso soup came out scalding hot, it was very sour. I've never in my life had a sour miso soup before, it left a terrible aftertaste. We both didn't finish it. The salmon carpaccio was delicate, yet offensively oily. Yes, they advertised that they use sesame oil in the dish, but that's all that we could taste. It did not compliment the salmon whatsoever. It coated our tongue and throats with oil and left such an unsettling feeling in our stomaches. We decided to politely but quickly cancel the rest of our orders - we couldn't eat anything else. The oil wrecked our palates.\n\nThe servers were very timid and apologetic. They really didn't care to know what was wrong. Though, we felt it was necessary to explain to them our disappointment. They said sorry about that, disappeared for a little bit, and then they brought out our check. We could see the manager pacing back and forth and going about it like nothing happened.\n\nWe paid our bill in a hurry and left over 75% of the eel roll, 60% of the #2 roll and 50% of our miso soup, when we walked out. There was a hefty amount of food that we left. (See picture). In the end we paid $33 for half of food we didn't eat and a stomach ache. We left unsatisfied and hungry, and we immediately drove to yummy sushi and grill. (We ended up spending $60 at yummy to get our fill, so, a grand whopping total of $100 for our dinner tonight - just because of our deplorable experience at Sen of Japan).\n\nWe are not in any way trying to hitch a free ride or freeloaders, but we truly felt that the management was unexceptional. The manager was dodgy, didn't show any effort, or even try extend his hand to help alleviate the situation. He didn't even come to the table to talk to us. Instead, he just said sorry about that as we were already walking out the door. As I was already half way out the door (standing in the doorway with my hand holding the door open), he then quickly asked us what was wrong with our food. We politely gave him detailed feedback and explained our issues. His response? He just said sorry about that and then defended the dish, telling us that the dish was supposed to taste like sesame oil. Ha. \n\nI can't even. Too much disappointment for me to even continue. I would never expect to encounter such a poor experience from a highly rated, tried and true restaurant. To each his own."

I don't think I've ever used soy sauce here, it just isn't needed. The rolls are delicious too, but I believe it is the quality and plating of the sashimi which sets them apart from all other sushi restaurants in the U.S. This never disappoints, I've been coming here every time in Vegas for the past 14 years and every time I eat here it gets better! If you're not willing to pay for the freshest fish this may not be right for you. It truly doesn't get any better than this."

We each ordered a different white by the glass, which the waiter brought to our table in small carafes and poured. As is our habit, we tasted each other' s wine, and we were  shocked to discover we had been given the same thing. When we informed our waiter, he brought over an already open bottle and poured from it, proving absolutely nothing. It, too, was the same! We should have required two bottles to be uncorked in front of us, but Instead of making a further to do ....we continued with our meal.\nSoft shell crab was good, some sushi was fine, but one roll, a simple California roll, was not edible.\nThe only reason I give them stars at all, after feeling defrauded, is the service, which is impeccable.

Our waitress told us that the lemon had been abandoned and that the dish now came with a ginger chili paste.\n\nThat was a good call.

Every piece tasted uniquely like no other sushi I have ever had to date. All simple, delicate, artful, refined but with unique clever twists and ornate presentation. It is easily the freshest fish I have ever tasted outside of Maui, Honolulu or Tokyo. I am honestly speechless! If I had a last meal this would be it. Go here and don't ask any more questions. Set aside everything you know about sushi, sit down at the sushi bar and just put your hands and tatsebuds in the hand of a wonderful chef.

The desserts at Sen are made to order in house, and are to die for.\n\nSen is open late. Even if you eat elsewhere, you can come here for dessert. You will not be disappointed.\n\nAlmond Yuzu Frangipane Tart 5/5\nLuscious, soft, crispy, molten, delicious. Words fail me when trying to describe this. It's incredible. It takes everything I have not to ooh and ahhh like a baby every time I eat this. It's more like an upside down souffle than a tart. The \"crust\" outside is perfectly crisp, the inside is molten almond lava. On the side is a scoop of fresh pineapple sorbet, eat them together and you get a crazy mix of hot, cold, crispy and gooey textures, sweet, nutty, and zesty flavors. It's complex but it really works. If you like almond flavor in the least, get this.\n\nChocolate Souffle with Green Tea Ice Cream 5/5\nLike any good souffle, this is made to order and served hot, fresh out of the oven. A souffle is difficult to perfect, not just the recipe but it has to be baked for just the right amount of time. They get it right on the money every time here. The outer layer is crisp, the chocolate center is molten and gooey. The chocolate is rich and the flavors go very well with the green tea ice cream, bitter, earthy and sweet.\n\nYou really have to give this place some credit for making these desserts to order, and even making the sorbet and ice cream in house. These desserts take longer to get to your table than premade desserts, count on waiting 10-15 minutes for them to come out after you order. If you are in a hurry, put the dessert order in before you are finished with your food. It's worth it!"

Service was good.  We eat at a lot of other sushi place so we think our reviews are fair.  Food is above average and the price is also higher than the comparable sushi place.  There are better place to go eat for us. For example, I can go to Suncoast Oyster Bar and get much better spider roll for a cheaper price.  For a little more money, we can just go eat at Hachi at Red Rock which has better roll and service."

Dim-lighting, soft music and wooden floors.. It was a little warm at first at our table but it eventually cooled down.. \n\nWe ordered :\nSashimi Salad: Fresh cuts of fish & I liked the capers in the salad\nSoft Shell Crab Roll topped with Spicy Tuna: The spicy tuna really stood out in taste and appearance.. you could just tell it was very good quality..\nFoie Gras Udon: I don't think it was worth $18 haha came with 2 tiny little pieces of foie gras.. I will say that the broth had a nice deep flavor and it came with lots of yummy greens.. \n\nFor those 3 items without tip it was about $50 so it's not cheap by any means but if you are looking for a nice sushi place that's a step up from your neighborhood joint but don't want to go all the way to the strip then Sen of Japan is perfect for you~\n\n\nHOT TIP: Late night HH (Mon-Sat; 10:30PM-1:30AM)"

            "review": "Yikes! Reading the other reviews here, I'm wondering if everyone else went to the same restaurant I did! Unfortunately, I have to go strongly against the grain:  Sen of Japan was an incredibly poor experience.\n\nThere were early warning signs. First off, our waiter couldn't even pronounce the Japanese fish names correctly. Then, on the menu, kanpachi was listed as \"baby king mackerel\" (see picture). These should have been big red flags that Sen of Japan isn't a passable sushi joint; nevertheless, we continued on. Let's just say we gave them a few mulligans.\n\nThose mulligans were proven undeserved when our orders of the otoro sushi were a disaster. When we picked up the sushi with our chopsticks, the rice literally fell apart. Not a single person in my party - and we're all very experienced sushi eaters and chopstick users -  was able to pick up the otoro and eat it before it disintegrated. Want a picture of the most epic fail (that barely made it two inches above the plate before crashing and burning)? See attached. Ya, I'm not exaggerating. Seeing otoro like that brings a tear to my eye.\n\nWorse yet, the chef loves drenching everything in sauce with totally overpowering flavors (the waiter touted the nigiri with sauce as the chef \"specialty\"). I just don't understand it. Nigiri is something that should implicitly taste good. It's not something that anyone should need to cover up with other flavors in order to be edible. When a chef puts toppings/sauce on nigiri, the goal should be to complement the existing flavor or possibly even evoke a new perspective or understanding of the central ingredient - not completely overwhelm it.\n\nUnfortunately, at Sen of Japan, overwhelm the fish is exactly what the chef does. I could barely make out the salmon underneath all that heavy citrus fruit flavor from the orange miso sauce. It was horrifying. And the sauces aren't even tailor made for specific nigiri. The waiter offered either an orange miso or a spicy sauce with the salmon, and told us we could get those sauces on other sushi too. I honestly felt like we should have been at McDonald's dunking our nigiri like Chicken McNuggets in those sauce packs.\n\nThe chef takes the same approach to the sumibiyaki. No matter what we ordered - and we got the chicken, shrimp, squid, and scallop - the skewer is absolutely drenched in sauce. Very disappointing.\n\nService was also quite poor. Refills on tea and water were far and few in between. Waiter disappeared for a long time with our credit card when we were trying to pay. Also, a waitress got a huge attitude when another party member asked her where they source their duck meat, responding sarcastically \"I don't know, is there somewhere it should be from?\" We were all taken aback, and have no idea why that was an offensive question to her. (Speaking of the duck tataki, I'd recommend skipping it; it tasted more like hickory-smoked BBQ pork than duck.) Finally, they also charged us for fresh wasabi. It's not even in the point-of-sale system, as evidenced on our bill - they just tacked it on as an additional charge. C'mon, I think we ordered enough food that you don't need to nickel and dime us.\n\nAll in all, Sen of Japan fails because it is neither a passable Japanese restaurant nor a passable fusion restaurant, and the service is bad to boot. The dishes we tried had at best a vaguely Japanese vibe, and even the chef's 'specialty' item - nigiri drenched in overpowering sauce - is utterly lacking in execution."

One of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in LV.\n\nThe restaurant itself is in a shopping center so it doesn't seem all that but it SO IS ALL THAT! Our server was also very kind, attentive and efficient.  \n\nStarted off with some edamame, I really like their edamame because they season it so well to make it so tasty.  Here's a break down of what we ordered:\n-Filet mignon tataki: SO GOOOOOD. I saw pictures of this dish and knew it would be gooooood. And I was right. For raw meat lovers- this is a must. Tender and a generous helping.\n-Salmon Carpaccio: Pretty good, the seasoning was a bit much so I scraped it off. Still good!\n-Philadelphia roll: According to my friend, she could have had 2 orders of this dish! Must have been great!\n-Cajun Albacore with Garlic Ponzu: I had to honor of having this fantastic dish! AMAZING AND A MUST TRY. The mushrooms and the garlic ponzu greatly compliment the seared albacore. So sooooooo amazing.\n\nAnd for dessert we had the chocolate souffl\u00e9 of course, with the green tea ice cream. I was a bit puzzled about the combination but found it to be quite tasty!! Souffle was not bad at all.  I would give it a 7/10.  \n\nThe bill came out to be around 70$ total. Which isn't bad at all considering the quality of the food!! I would DEFINITELY recommend coming here if you're in the area... definitely going to come back too!"

After reading the reviews, we both decided it would be a great place to try.  Upon finding the location in a common looking strip mall, I was initially unimpressed.  We walked in and I turned to my spouse and said, \"I'm glad that we didn't get dressed up\".  After that everything went perfectly.  \n\nJohn, the server was so great.  We told him we were from San Francisco and he said \" you must be foodies\".  We told him that we came for the  OMAKASE SPECIAL  I knew it was pricey but it wasn't the first time, we'd drop over $60 per person at a sushi place.  Since it was a special occasion and I had planned on spending about $100 per person, the price  of $85 per person was expected.  \n\nWe were given an impeccable 8 course menu.  John absolutely knew the menu well and was able to recite what we were being given without it seeming rehearsed.  The sashimi  was outstanding and so fresh.  The sauces on the sushi were creative and had a great balance of flavors as well as being beautiful to the eye.  The dishes that came from the kitchen were wonderful and though we didn't necessarily agree on which dish was our favorite, we definitely felt that the sushi chef gets an A for effort as well as an A for taste and presentation.  \n\nThe wait staff was so friendly and helpful including the Sake choice.  We were not disappointed.\n\nThis place doesn't have the curb appeal of the strip.  What it does have is creativity that clearly shows the love of the chefs.  The chef actually came out to ask us if all was okay and wanted to genuinely know how we felt about the dishes.  Some were a bit tart and others a bit on the sweet side, but no soy sauce was ever used nor encouraged to be use as each bite needed to be experienced as the chef intended and not masked by soy.\n\nWhen returning to Vegas, we'll be sure to stop by again.  Perhaps this time just to have an ordinary dinner which I'm sure will still be well above grade."

            "review": "Went to Sen of Japan a few nights ago, got 6-course Omakase. They asked if it was our first time there, and we responded yes. Probably a *huge* mistake. \n\n1. Yellowtail sashimi w ponzu and toasted garlic. Executed well but uninventive.\n\n2. Sashimi salad - 2x tuna, 2x salmon, 2x albacore sashimi. Greens, dressing, capers. The salad and dressing were good. Tuna was tasteless. Salmon and albacore tasted very good.\n\n3. Clam and miso soup, 2x tuna roll, and nigiri: tuna, salmon, albacore, yellowtail, fluke. Haven't we already had all of these except fluke? Salmon and albacore tasted great as before. Everything else meh. And no interesting pieces of fish. Honestly the fish at jjanga has been comparable IME and that's $25 AYCE and I get way more variety.\n\n4. Miso black cod w wasabi aioli and eel sauce reduction. The absolute nuts. Everyone has a miso black cod, but this might be the best I've eaten. Very much the saving grace of this meal, and the only reason I'd consider coming back.\n\n5. Beef tenderloin w asparagus and greens in a mustard sauce. Meat was barely flavored. Mustard sauce saved the day. But Jesus, good meat like this shouldn't need saving with a mustard sauce...\n\n6. Dessert: green tea ice cream and chocolate souffl\u00e9. Ice cream was not overly smoky (a problem with a lot of green tea flavored desserts) but it also barely tasted like green tea. Souffl\u00e9 was good but pretty standard.\n\nLook, I get it: 6 course omakase for $55. I wasn't expecting Kabuto or Yui. But I felt like the offerings were completely uninteresting and for something designed that simple, every dish needs to be perfect, even @$55. This fell way flat.\n\nHere's my real gripe:\nI felt like we totally got the gringo treatment as the host or mgr continually told us how his chefs would create off-menu experiences for repeat customers. Like wtf we just dropped $180 on dinner and drinks, off-strip, and you gave us one really good and 5 mediocre dishes. So what, we're supposed to come back and do it again and hope it's better next time? I asked what would be on a sample \"repeat\" omakase menu, and he just said \"whatever's freshest and whatever the chef thinks would be best.\" \n\nWell, what the **** was the \"omakase\" I ordered? It's not really omakase if you give everyone the same intro-to-sushi menu. They should call whatever this was something like the \"Sen 6-course prix fixe.\" Honestly I'd prefer it if they'd call it something that people who know good food would never in a million years order -- maybe the \"Samurai Special.\"\n\nI think it's a mistake to think people haven't had good Japanese food before, especially in this town.\n\nI have foodie friends who eat there a LOT and rave about the food. And I've read a ton of reviews about the quality of their fish. But I'll have a hard time going back anytime soon when I can spend less for more at dozens of places in town. Really pretty upset in hindsight, especially since I took my wife for her birthday and was super excited based on what I'd heard and read. \n\nWaitstaff was friendly and engaging. Restaurant was clean and inviting, including restrooms."

            "review": "I have a rule of thumb when it comes to passing final judgement on an Indian restaurant: the quality of food should be based on their a la carte dinner entrees rather than their buffet since the drop-off between the two can often be quite steep.  I believe there is a Japanese restaurant corollary in that one should judge the quality of food based on their omakase (tasting menu designated by the chef) rather than their a la carte menu items.  Of course, there is usually a hike in price in both cases but sometimes you pay for what you get, and what you get here for omakase is definitely money well spent.\n\nOne would never guess that tucked away in SW suburbia lies a restaurant opened by Hiro Nakano, the former head chef of Nobu (Hard Rock Casino) and was listed in the 2009 Michelin guide.  I met up with some work colleagues and since my boss was treating the group, we decided to indulge in the $55 omakase experience (an $85 option was available, but one should not test the limits of generosity when being treated to a complimentary meal by your superior).  Probably the most interesting question I have ever encountered when deciding on the omakase was being prompted by the server as to how many times I have had the omakase specifically at their restaurant.  Apparently the chef likes to vary the dishes so as to create a different experience for the diner much like a video game character advancing to higher levels of play!  Apparently the variations can go up to \"level 5\" and possibly beyond so I found this to be a ingenious incentive to return for repeat tasting adventures.  A couple members of our party were second-timers so it was cool to get a preview as to what I would be expecting after my first omakase here.  I'm sure the chef would be more than willing to mix and match specific items since the theme to this idea is thoughtfulness towards the customer.\n\nItems I could recollect along with occasional sidenotes with regard to the level 2 menu.\n\n1) Hawaiian yellowtail marinated with yuzu soy:  unctuous and refreshing with bright notes of citrus from the yuzu, very nice start to the meal (level 2 was japanese red snapper)\n\n2) Sashimi salad- delicate slices of assorted fish mixed with shredded daikon and greens in a subtle onion vinaigrette--very clean flavors\n\n3) Miso Black cod with grilled shishito pepper- perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fish pretty much melts in your mouth and goes well with a nice salty crunch from the pepper (I think in the $85 omakase, this dish is accompanied with grilled fois gras....talk about umami overload!)\n\n4)  Sliced filet mignon served with grilled asparagus-  found this one to be slightly underwhelming since while being cooked medium rare, was a bit under-seasoned and would have liked some asian flavors to be incorporated (the second-timers received a similar cut but was topped with a spicy chili sauce so I'm thinking that version was tastier)\n\n5) Miso soup with wakame (firm seaweed) and mini button mushrooms-  the cute little mushrooms are not only tasty but also provide an artistic glow to the otherwise cloudy earth-tone broth. \n\n6) Nigiri assortment- fairly standard with a couple tuna sushi rolls, one regular shrimp and mackerel nigiri, and pairs of salmon and tuna nigiri....nothing mind-blowing, but helps to fill you up with the added load of rice.\n\n7) Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream-  nice way to round out the meal.  Souffle could have been more fluffy, but definitely a unexpectedly pleasant flavor combination with the green tea ice cream...I got a chance to taste the almond frangipane cake with pineapple sorbet in the second timers dessert course and that was equally exquisite.\n\nI'm thinking I may have omitted one more sashimi course, but as one can see, this is quite a spread for $55 and I definitely did not go home hungry.  Folks residing in this part of town should definitely take advantage of having such a fine dining option nearby and for those trekking from across town, definitely a nice introduction to omakase at a reasonable price with opportunities to \"level-up\" with subsequent visits.  Be sure to also take advantage of their excellent sake selection."

I've been resisting this place ever since I met my fianc\u00e9 two and a half years ago, but I finally gave in this weekend.

I think the overall gist of it was that the more expensive option had the more expensive meats/fishes.  In our conversation with our server, what impressed me what they do cater to your tastes depending on if this is your first time versus fifth time there.\n\nWe decided the $55 Omakase and planned to order a la carte if we were still hungry.\n1.  Jalape\u00f1o Yellowtail with olive oil ponzu sauce - Ponzu sauce can make a lot of things taste good and this is one of them.  Tangy, spicy with jalape\u00f1o. \n2.  Sashimi salad with various basic cuts of fish - no wow factor but the salad dressing was good\n3.  Beef Filet - just a tad overcooked but nice concept\n4.  Nigiri Sushi (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, shrimp, tuna roll) - not super fresh but not bad either.\n5.  Miso soup with clam - very bland soup\n\nA la carte\n1.  Uni - very fresh.. mmm butter of the sea\n2.  Oh toro - not the freshest but still good\n\nConclusion:  Fish shipments are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, hence our fishes not being the freshest on our visit Monday. My overall experience was good, and I think Sen of Japan has some potential for becoming my dedicated omakase joint.  3.75 stars for now.  I'll hopefully upgrade with subsequent visits. =)"

In terms of the entree, from past experience with filet mignon, if it's good, I don't need to dip it in sauce for flavor, but this one constantly needed dipping. My mom's sukiyaki was cloyingly sweet and therefore gave off a superficial taste. My dad's sashimi combo was nothing exceptional; presentation was alright with the bowl of sushi atop a bowl of ice to keep it cool, but in terms of taste it was average. The bottom line is that the food was edible but not noteworthy for the price, plus there might have been some MSG because my mom had an allergic reaction afterward.

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and they were incredibly quick to pick up dishes when we were done. The atmosphere was nice and cozy, esp. because they sat us right next to the only other party in the restaurant leaving the rest of the place completely empty. I dunno... I think I would have preferred a little personal space. I expected to be blown away by the food since the exec chef trained under Matsuhisa. But the whole experience was underwhelming. Other items on the menu sounded great so this place might be worth another try."

So as you can imagine this place was awesome and the fish was super fresh.\n\nI went with a group of 6 people and we decided to not look at the menu. We chose to have the chef serve us whatever he likes. He served us many standard rolls, raw pieces with amazing sauces on them and lots of different types of cooked fish.\n\nIf you choose to eat this way, make sure you tell them when you are getting full because they will just keep it coming for hours. This is not your standard pricing for sushi, it is a little up scale. So don't expect to get all you can eat here for 20.00."

You'll become a regular for sure. \n\nThe quality of the fish that you will find here is outstanding. The food is also prepared very well. I've never walked out of this place unsatisfied.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat romantic...the lighting is dim and the music puts you at ease...perfect to where you can hear the other party but not have to constantly be conversing to avoid awkward silences. \n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the Black Cod Miso with Foie Gras. The dish is just delicious! The sauce is so addicting!!! Sweet but not too sweet where it overpowers the fish...I found myself dragging the last piece all over the plate to make sure that I had every last drop. \n\nTheir desserts are also amazing. They serve Bubbies mochi icecream which is a popular brand that comes from Hawaii !! Their chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream is a must try for those who love chocolate!! The souffle is made to order and served hot fresh out of the oven. Out server always suggests this to us while we are ordering our main dishes so they they could get a head start.  It is perfectly gooey and lava like on the inside and crisp on the outside like a delicious souffle should be.\n\n\nThey also had a wide variety of Sake to choose from if you enjoy that with your meal. Overall the service is fantastic. The food is impeccable. Sen of Japan just does it right. \n\n\n*****1030-130 happy hour!!!"

They start off with a few courses including black cod, and finish with nigiri sushi.  If you have had it before, they will give you omaksase version #2, etc.  They have fantastic lunch specials on the weekdays as well.  The almond franjipan dessert is not to be missed.  Then again the warm chocolate souffle cake with green tea ice cream is superb too.  It costed about $40 to cab here from the strip, but boy it was worth it.  And you're paying half the price of the trendy Japanese restaurants on the strip."

We were recommended to get the $85 Omakase so we did we got 2 and ordered other dishes that weren't a part of it. For a local place it's got really gold quality fish! Service was excellent our server was very thorough and explained every dish to us as it came to our table! It was a near close to Nobu experience with out the ambiance and a better price. Our tab came out to $400 plus 20% tip so be prepared to pay about $100-$150 a head for a good meal! It's not bad for good quality food! I would definitely come back and try more dishes I probably won't get the Omakase again. My only complaint is the portions from Omakase were pretty small, the foie gras on top of the sea bass was the size of a quarter so that def wouldn't fill you up so I was glad we ordered extra sashimi & nigiri on top of that. So 1 star off for that."

I've recently been twice, however, and am happy to report the food is as good as ever.\n\nBoth times I had the Black Cod Soy, because going to Sen of Japan and not getting the Black Cod Soy is like going to Italy and not getting pasta. It's a buttery piece of fish with a caramelized, but not overpowering, sweet exterior. Each bite melts in your mouth it may be the best piece of fish you've ever tasted. The pickled shoot that adorns it is also fantastic and offers a complementary acidic element ($13.75, add $9 to top it with fois gras).\n\nBesides the cod, I sampled a few other old favorites, the home-made Japanese Pickles and the Mushroom Salad. The pickles are made from yamagobo (similar to a carrot), turnip, Japanese yam, cabbage, and something reminiscent of a caper berry. Each piece has a slightly different flavor and texture, but all offer a colorful, crunchy start to the meal ($8.50). The mushroom salad consists of a warm mound of gently sauteed mushrooms, including enoki and wood ear. It has a heavy dose of yuzu that makes it taste bright, and a bit tart ($7.75).\n\nThe sashimi is of the caliber of Raku, but here you can have rice with your fish at the full service sushi bar. The spicy yellowtail hand roll ($4.80) is bursting with flavor and filling, but a new favorite is the Sashimi Combination Salad with Garlic Vinaigrette ($12.95). Impecably fresh slices of normally mundane varieties, including tuna and salmon, are arranged around a pile of delicate Japanese greens topped with finely shredded radish. A light dose of garlic vinaigrette and sprinkling of capers complete the masterpiece.\n\nAnother surprise favorite was the fried calamari with onion (around $9). Tender strips of squid are paired with onion slices then beer battered and toped with slices of jalapeno. These taste like onion rings of the upscale variety.\n\nThe sukiyki was the only thing I wouldn't order again, but that's probably because I'm partial to preparing my own sukiyaki at Swish (review to come later). Overall, however, Sen of Japan is a place you should try at least once, even if it might be a little inconvenient to get to."

With so many reviews of high praises had me highly anticipating this meal, and at the end of it i thought WTF. The dining room isnt anything fancy at all, its actually not even warm or inviting in any way. I can say that service is super attentive, and they are knowledgeable of the menu so a star for that. But when it comes down to the actual food, although it was good it simply wasnt anything that made me want to return. Especially after the $120 bill for 2, when i could have went to any number of spots and eaten for half that and felt the same way after my meal. Having a combination of both the rolls, and their signature sashimi and nigiri with special sauces. Its different of course with combinations like Salmon w/ Orange Miso, or Scallop with Spicy Lime Dressing, but different doesnt always mean better and i think thats true in this case. I read that rolls with mango were a must, and we tried a few of them but id say only one of them really \"worked\" well together. Toward the end of the meal i found myself ordering a final roll in the more traditional offering because all the weird sauces etc didnt do it for me. \nIf your looking to get away from the more traditional sushi offerings with weird sauces, unique ingredient combos, etc then sure come on by, but expect to drop a decent amount of cash on the bill. But if you enjoy sushi because of the taste, texture and quality of the actual fish and preparation that doesnt taka away from that then go elsewhere. I will not return."

The first person that picked up the phone did not speak English that well, asked me to hold and came back on line again five mins later. I inquired about going in for dinner and then she said hold on. At that time an English speaking person got on the phone and said that if we wanted to, we could come in at 7:30 and if there was tables available they would sit us, otherwise put us in the sushi bar. Okay, since the sushi was highly rated we decided to give it at try. This place is in the burbs off the strip and is about a $30 taxi ride each way including tip, \nWhen we arrived, there was no hostess at the area where the counter was so we just sat in the chairs waiting. A man came up to us, looked at us and then sent another person to come to us. She asked if we had reservations and I recognized her voice and told her we had spoken on the phone and she told us to swing in to see what they could do, and she said, oh yeah I remember, please wait. From our view we observed two tables that each sat two people that where empty for 20 minutes. Two workers came in and looked at us as more people where arriving and hoovering around, yet when we inquired about the two empty tables we were ignored. \nOne employee greeted another employee as she arrived for work with the phrase, \"Welcome to Hell\". \nAfter 45 minutes we sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef said I will be with you in a minute. 15 mins went by, and we ordered Miso , Edamame, Tempura Sweet Potato, to start. It arrived 20 mins later. after that was finished, we just waiting for his que to order as he was too busy yelling at the other sushi chefs for making mistakes. After being at the Sushi bar for a total of 45 mins, (those two empty tables still empty), we ordered 28 pieces of sushi. \nThe first order arrived 15 minutes after we ordered and then it started to trickle in a bit faster. \nThe quality of the sushi is by far some of the best I have had and in my opinion would beat anything in the Bay Area for quality. \nHowever, the overall 3 hour dining experience was not worth it. \nThe price is reasonable, we spent $180 on the food + $60 for the taxi. \nBut again, it was perhaps in my opinion the worse managed Japanese restaurant and poorly trained employees I have experienced in my life time. \nWe won't go back"

To be honest; I haven't had red meat in over twenty years, so maybe I'm not the best judge of this - but the steak was SO flavorful. the texture was perfect, and the gentle citrus/mustard glaze seemed to hit every taste bud in my mouth all at the same time. It was almost overwhelmingly delicious. I would bring my Meat-and-Potatoes father from Nebraska here just for the steak.\n\nThe service was wonderful; with a friendly wait staff that seemed to love answering questions about the food.

They helped us decide on a wonderful sake.

It was simply amazing what the chef was able to put together for us on a Wednesday evening at 9:00 PM with no notice or reservation. It was simply the best sashimi I have ever had and the most creative, given the selection of fish available that night. The chef even apologized as we walked out, \"Sorry, it was all I could do.

He didn't give anything other than plain sushi - no great eyes-popping-out-of-my-head surprises. My husband ordered a chicken dish and it was half mushrooms (we thought it would only have just a few mushrooms), so he left quite hungry. Disappointing."

Had I not looked it up on Yelp, I never would have expected to find such good nigiri in this plaza, let alone for such good late happy hour prices!\n\nQuality of the fish here is outstanding. Highly recommend coming during late happy hour, 10:30PM to 1:30AM, Monday through Saturday. Seems to be a popular HH, as all the seats at the sushi bar were taken so I had to dine solo at a table. Service throughout my visit was attentive and non-judgmental, despite my ordering half the menu.\n\nHighly suggest ordering all of the HH nigiri listed- the black snapper with capers, red onion, and garlic soy sauce blew my mind. Salmon was thick, buttery, and beautiful, baked freshwater eel was just okay.\nThe designated HH rolls are also good- HH1 and HH2 both involve the albacore and spicy garlic ponzu sauce but somehow still manage to taste like fairly different rolls.\nIka-Age calamari, black cod butter lettuce, and mushroom miso weren't as memorable as the sushi options, but all were very solid. The lettuce wrap in particular was a very tasty small bite, the ika was enjoyable but not a must-have, and the miso was a good starter for the sushi, made heartier by the three thick slices of mushroom.\n\nInterior d\u00e9cor is upscale, service is friendly, HH menu cannot be beat for pricing and quality- definitely a good secret date-night place!"

(2)\n\nMy hubs and I came here about 2 years ago to sample their Valentine's Day omakase. Although there did appear to be a lot of cooked items, the quality of the food was enough to make us contemplate coming here again last week.\n\nWe arrived with a friend for some good eats but were disappointed on many levels.\n\nFirst of all, the service is highly lacking. Our waitress had the annoying habit of always trying to get us to order more expensive items on the menu. No, we do not want a miniscule bowl of edamame you want to charge $4.50 for when I can get a massive bag of it for less than $2. No, we do not want to order alcoholic drinks. No, we don't want any of your appetizers.\n\nAfter we kept politely declining her suggestions, she pretty much ignored us until she wanted to us to clear the bill. Which was frustrating because she didn't even bring out a bowl of rice that came with our meager meals. Not to mention that they removed our small plates when our food came out. \n\nLet me tell you, it feels totally ghetto eating out of their massive sashimi bowl because you are likely to drip soy sauce on the other pieces of fish. \n\nNot cool. Not zen. All ghetto. Sorry, but it had to be said.\n\nEnough about the shoddy service. More on the food.\n\nOur friend and I ordered the Sashimi Special Combination ($29.95) while the hubby got the Shin's Special Plate ($19.95).\n\nFor $19.95, the only special about Shin's Special Plate is how epic a rip it is. Although beautifully presented, the fish texturally, lack the firmness of really fresh product. The size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side. Although the seasoning of the various fish was varied, the pairing of flavors were only okay in my books. Nothing terribly innovative. And for 7 pieces of nigri, it is very expensive.\n\nThe sashimi special combination (sashimi plate, bowl of rice, miso soup) for $29.95 is also very expensive for what it was. The thin slices, the small portion size left me very disappointed. Top it off with fish that wasn't the finest quality (I went on a Thursday - no excuses!), I cannot recommend this dish to anyone.\n\nOverall, it's disappointing because there are very few decent sushi joints in town. But between the shoddy service, the lackluster fish quality and the skimpy portions, this place gets a 2 star."

The King Crab roll was by far the best crab roll I've ever had (seared, not tempura, so fresh!).  You could tell the rainbow roll had real crab, it was great. I want to say it was perfect, would be a 5 star review...unfortunately, we had bad salmon--both in the nigiri and the spicy salmon sashimi\nappetizer--both tasted really fishy. The spicy tuna also tasted very fishy--couldn't even eat it, literally left a bad taste in my mouth.  Service was great and the rest of the meal was perfect, but having not one, but 2 types of bad fish was really disappointing."

This is a perfect example of why.\n\nThe first time I ate at Sen I had a full dinner experience at normal dinner time. The fish is off the hook fresh and when combined with the chef's delicate sauces you experience yummytown. I know that is not sophisticated, but it is accurate. On the first trip, I was still not completely open to fish as a consumable item, but we were being treated, so I politely ate everything. The ingredients are so quality that I had no problem truly enjoying it.  \n\nAfter that first visit, we did not make it back for quite a while. I am not sure why, but one evening when I remembered it was open until 2am, we decided to return. This is when we discovered the reverse happy hour! They have a good selection of tasty treats. We almost always get yellowtail with ponzu, which is not on the happy hour menu. And, on the happy hour menu, the black cod lettuce wraps kick every other lettuce wrap's tush! I am generally suspicious of these green tacos, but I love these little guys. The flavor is miso. There is a little crunch, and the portion is not meager.\n\nFellow night owls and insomniacs: I'll see you at Sen City!"

We were given a 15% discount card after a few of our visits for being locals and regulars.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the service has greatly declined in the past year.  During previous visits we always received our food quickly, our table was cleared after we completed each course, our drinks rarely reached the half-full point, and we promptly received our bill when finished with our meal.  The opposite has been true for each of my last three visits and especially bad during the final one, in which a tempura dish was repeatedly forgotten despite reminders.  It also took over thirty minutes for us to receive our bill.\n\nAs much as I love Sen, and despite the memories and significance it holds for  my husband and I, we will not be returning.  The cost of a meal is too great for us to be treated poorly by our server.

Alice was her name I believe.  I think she was just into Yusaku and maybe thats why we got such good service.  I'll have to go again on my own to confirm what I will conclude in this review.\n\nGo to Sen of Japan if you want nobu for half the price and a tenth the pretentiousness."

Fish has always been really fresh every time we eat here. Also the chefs are really clean. I sat at the bar and watched our chef wash his hands like every 5 minutes."

            "review": "Sen is an interesting spot.  It's Japanese restaurant, fusion-type d\u00e9cor, and Las Vegas sports betting all mixed into one.  Let me explain.  So, the Japanese part is easy - hot towel when you walk in, Japanese food on the menu, and a sushi bar in the corner.  The d\u00e9cor had some other themes to it and was somewhat of an eclectic selection from the candle holders to the wall art.  Now, the sports bar?  I've never seen a Japanese restaurant with a big screen TV behind the sushi chefs with the popular football game of the night on.\n\nSo I was here to take The Wife on a long-overdue date since our son has been an incredible beast lately.  Honestly, raising the next generation of Yelpers is tough, especially when they share your \"pizzazz.\"  So we came for a quite dinner for The Wife's favorite, Japanese food.\n\nThe softshell crab roll she got was unremarkable.  There's only so much spicy tuna, ponzu sauce, and sriracha that people can experiment with to come up with the next \"creative\" sushi.  I'm a traditionalist - give me normal nigiri or sashimi and be done with it.  I had the chirashi and was disappointed - the chirashi at Tachibana in McLean had more fish and better variety for a \"special\" box than they had at Sen.  I felt like I had wasted my money.\n\nAlso, our server acted like she was high the entire time - and I'm talking baked on the good stuff since she didn't seem to connect sentences properly and would look at some ghost behind me through droopy eyes when we spoke.\n\nNo thanks, I'll go back to Raku."

I'm sure there are a lot of really good sushi places, maybe even better than this place, but I've never had any.  \n\nThis place is off the strip, a little bit of a drive, but ABSOLUTELY worth it!!!\n\nYou have to try it yourself, so I will leave it to you to decide.  But ask for the sushi roll that isn't on the menu.  It defies all human understanding! LOL!"

I told the sushi chef what fish I was in the mood for (akami tuna, hirame, fluke, hamachi) and he created some spectacular duos (see pictures) - the fish was definitely fresh, although some of his creations were better than others, and some were overpowered by his use of greens, resulting in lack of flavor; Which is why I only give them 4 stars. \n\nThe Black Cod soy was phenomenal, but I recommend you share it with someone as the tastes can be a little too much after a few bites.\n\nThey have an excellent Sake menu as well. Service was sub par as far as politeness. One of the servers actually shouted across the restaurant while we were dining, so I'm not immediately jumping in my car to try this place again- maybe in a few months."

As one diner commented, the quantities were small, but delicious.  Considering the restaurant was about half full when we arrived, the prep time was very fast.  We tried the green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and it was delicious!  We will definitely return again soon.\n\nThe place is a bit noisy due to hard surfaces, but once we adjusted to it, we were fine."

Who the fuck would have thought, this tiny little place west of the strip would have some incredible fish?\n\nSo surprised, and now I'm converted from naked fish. Dollar for dollar, best sushi I've ever had. From the sashimi/nigiri to the innovative rolls, it was an awesome dining experience that I'm excited to have again and again and again.\n\nBlack snapper, that's all I have to say.\n\nTrust me, I'm a doctor."

I like this place because you can order an array of dishes so that you can try each one without getting filled up.  \n\nBlack Cod- A must!!!\nGarlic Yellowtail with Yuzu- Yum!\nSashimi Salad (the one not listed on the menu-ask the server)- good! \nMochi ice cream- Mango is the best\nTofu Eggplant Agedashi- good\nSashimi-  tuna, albacore and yellowtail here is really good.  The salmon is just eh\nSeafood Ceviche with Kiwi- Just okay but worth a try\nCurry Sushi- Interesting\nFilet Mignon Citrus Soy- Ok\nAlmond Yuzu Franjipan- Good\n\n\nI would definitely like to come back to try more dishes.  I left happy!  Oh, and apparently Andre agassi is a regular here and was there at the time I ate. Fun!"

Seriously, it was some of the best I've ever had in Las Vegas and it could easily beat most sushi I've had in LA. I had the following items:\n\n1) Shrimp Tempura, Masago, Cucumber and Cream Cheese Inside with Salmon and Eel Sauce on Top (BOMB. Seriously, I have nothing against cream cheese in my sushi so it was grand. The fish was very, very fresh and tasty as well.)\n\n2) My cousin had Shrimp Tempura Roll with Seared Salmon and Sweet Chili Sauce on top and it was so fresh and the sauce was good as well.\n\n3) Quail Meatball Skewers (Delicious, fresh, and well cooked. It came with a poached egg to dip it in! Yum.)\n\n4) Kalbi Short Ribs with butter lettuce. (This was a wrap and was super tasty!)\n\n5) Salmon Nigiri (Fish was super fresh, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Good price for it though!)\n\n6) Peanut Butter and Chocolate Mochi. (SERIOUSLY. Try it. You won't regret it!)\n\nAll of this + two bottles of sake = happy me. It wasn't cheap, but you get what you pay for.\n\nOh and the service is good! What more could you ask for?"

Sen of Japan is as good of a sushi place as they come (and let's be real, we live in a desert). Always fresh, always great service and the variety of different flavors is incredible. You know how you go to sushi places and they put the same sauce on every roll? Not here. Mango, strawberry, pineapple sauces...on sushi! It's crazy...but it works! Kind of a weird location in a strip mall but hey, they gotta hide from the tourists somehow! I love Sen of Japan and try to make it in here for every birthday and special or even non-special occasion!"
