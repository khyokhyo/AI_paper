On my second time back here, I had the duck noodle soup and tom yum soup again, and DAMN were they OILY. I felt like I was just drinking luke warm oil. The pad thai and the curry I had we're just okay. I don't think I'll be coming back here, I didn't feel so good after eating here... Look elsewhere and don't let other drunken people convince you it's good."

This is where I come for my Thai/Chinese fix!\n\nThe restaurant is on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View Blvd. You'll find parking in the strip plaza. It does get busy though!\n\nIt's very nicely decorated inside. There is plenty of seating, the booths are pretty big but if you need something for a larger party then there are plenty of tables to go around.\n\nRestrooms are typically ok.\n\nThere is a full bar but I have never really seen too many people sit there.\n\nFREE Wi-Fi.\n\nCustomer service is usually fast and efficient. The waiters are very friendly and knowledgable when you ask a question about the menu or a dish.\n\nThe food is to die for! Always fresh and hot when it comes out. My favorite dish is the Mongolian Beef/ Chicken. It's topped with some fried noodles that totally make the dish! My husband likes many of the dishes so he does not have one is particular. We usually get an order of potstickers but they are deep fried and are too crunchy for my tastes.\n\nGive this place a try! You will get hooked!"

We ordered 2 plates of fried rice, 1 plate of kung pao chicken, 1 plate of spicy cat fish. We then added an order of shrimp. After waiting for close to 45 minutes!!!!!, and watching other people getting served who came way after us, and multiple enquiries, we got only the shrimp dish. Again after multiple queries, we got the full order, but only one serving of rice. The catfish was burnt beyond imagination. The shrimp tasted like a reheated plate...very leathery and burnt crispy. An old lady (may be owner or management ) asked us \"how was it\"...we said we are really disappointed.  Her response..\" you still finished your food, didn't you\"...!!!!!!"

            "review": "I would love to give 5 stars, and if it was based off strictly food and price it would be. Very affordable and very good food. Some of my favorite fried rice in Vegas and hard to put down once you start eating. I haven't sat down to eat here yet but ordered take out a few times.\n\nIf they are not busy, take out is fairly easy as someone usually sees you walk in and comes to help you. However on busy nights such as this past Monday, I went in to pick up my food and waited about 10 minutes before someone acknowledged me being there. I then waited close to 10 minutes for them to ring me up in the back along with another guy who was there before me while our food sat there bagged up on the table. Food was still very hot when i got home so no issues there, just think they should have a dedicated \"host/ess\" when you walk in. If you walk in now, it's like whoever is available will come over and seat you or take your order.\n\nSeemed like many of the people sitting at the restaurant were frustrated with wait times for food or service as well. Saw one guy get up and go grab the water jug from the server stand since nobody was coming to his table to refill and one table had to grab a server so that they would take the order for the table.\n\nMinus the obvious service issues on busy nights, I highly recommend this place for the food! We have enjoyed all dishes we have had and I absolutely love the fried rice."

The small Asian knick knacks in the interior of the restaurant could use a good dusting/cleaning.  Once you notice, it gets really distracting."

            "review": "Note: This is a review on my take-out only experiences with this restaurant. (4 in total)\n\nKung Fu Plaza brands itself as a Chinese-Thai eatery, but my experience has been that its Chinese dishes do not taste authentic at all. \n\nThe chicken noodle soup is extremely oily, to the point of being inedible. I had ordered this for a sick friend, and was quite unhappy about its quality. The wonton soup is much better, but nothing above the ordinary. The hot and sour soup is nowhere near the regular Szechuan version that you would expect - this one is orangey-yellow. The chow mein is passable, but your best bet is probably the thai curries, which are quite tasty, and as a plus, taste good as leftovers.\n\nWhat I do like about them is their cheerful and quick service."

Between the two of us, we ordered the chicken fried rice, chicken pad siew-ew, and the pad woon sen. I would have added pictures to this review, but I was so hungry when the food got here I completely forgot to take pictures, ha!\n\nThe process to order online was seamless and, for an Asian food restuarant, in my opinion, ahead of the game in comparison to other restaurants (http://www.kungfuplaza.com/). Their website is very clean and well laid out. It lists out all of their food items, descriptions of the foods, as well as pictures. When you go to check-out you fill in all of your information and it offers places to add comments should there be any special requests, option to add tip, as well as an option to pick when you want your food delivered (in case you were ordering for later and would not have time to put an order in or for future deliveries).\n\nI was sent an emailed receipt detailing all of the tidbits I added on to my order including my instructions on where to drop off and which number to call upon arrival and a breakdown of the receipt. I don't usually get impressed by a site or receipt so it says a lot when I say I was very impressed by this.\n\nUpon arrival, the driver called to let me know he was five minutes away and where he would be. The food was fresh and was still piping hot when I took it back to the office. It was very flavorful and they gave us so much for the price!\n\nThanks, Kung Fu! We will be ordering again."

We came in anyway.\n\nAfter looking over the menu, we picked out a soup, a noodle dish and a few more Chinese dishes.  The food took some time, which was kinda weird since they weren't very busy!  When the food started coming out, it was one at a time, we generally enjoy family style, with a little bit of each on our plates, but the food was so slow, we had time to eat one at a time. \n\nThe food as good, very good flavor and we weren't disappointed, but the service wasn't what we're used too!"

I also happen to see a guy I went to high school with who is now a drummer in a famous band, but that's another story.\nAnother tasty place for Thai food."

Their Thai food is excellent though!  I always order the same three dishes:  the fried chicken wings, the pork salad, and the mint chicken.  So if you want really really good food, order these three items!\n\nThe fried chicken wings have almost never failed me, except maybe once or twice in 5 years.  I love how crunchy it is on the outside and how moist it is in the inside.  They don't seem to put much spices or salt on it, and it's just delicious the way it is.  The pork salad is also really good, and it's kind of sour, sweet, and savory.  The mint chicken is also to die for.  There's just something about it that is better than any other versions of mint/basil chicken I have ever had at Thai restaurants.  Give me some of that with the jasmine rice and I'm good to go.\n\nTheir service is not always the best, but servers are always polite and fast.  I've never had a problem with a long wait.  Of all Thai places I've tried, this is still my favorite!  Maybe because I LOVE me some good crunchy and crispy chicken wings and this is as good as it gets!"

I feel like whenever I take a bite of their food, this is what Thai food should taste like. Their Chinese food is pretty good too, although it may not be as authentic as a normal Chinese place, they serve some good Chinese food here as well.\n\nI've been coming to this place with my family for a number of years now. I always love coming to this place for the food and I enjoy chatting with some of the waiters. It's friendly for family, and large parties if necessary. \n\nMy favorite things to eat from here are the pad thai, pad se ew, and general Tso's chicken. Kung Fu gets pad thai correctly and cooks their pad se ew well and both have flavor. Their general Tso's chicken is sweet and has a slightly spicy flavor to it and this is best eaten at the restaurant so it is still crispy when you eat it! I have ordered their curry, vegetable dishes, tom kha soup, and I enjoy them all!\n\nDon't be scared to try this place, it will not disappoint. A lot of people enjoy coming here and you will soon find out why."

I ordered the chicken pad Thai and my man had the combination pad Thai.  We split a bbq pork fried rice.  Needless to say we had a ton of left overs as we could have split one meal and been full.  Everything we ordered was great!  Loved the delicate sauce on the pad Thai.  \n\nCan't beat the location as it's just off spring mountain and valley view.

I ordered a yellow chicken curry. Usually curry comes in a semi-thick sauce but they was plan soupy. The rice we ordered for our curry ended up being over cooked and dry. Even though the curry sauce wasn't as thick as I'm used to it was still delicious. Not as spicy as I wanted it but It was an \"Americanized 10\" not Thai 10 on the scale of spicy. \n\nChinese Food: 2/5  I'm not much of a Chinese food eater because I've noticed a lot of Chinese dishes are super oil and greasy. BUT We ordered some kind of stir fried Mongolian Beef dish. It was definitely a Chinese dish because the sauce was oily you could see the oil bubbles. \n\nService: 3/5 The service was good even during busy hours. The place was a bit of mess though. There was rice and pea's ever where, but I just brushed it off because there were children running around. This place seems family ordinate but it was also loud."

I discovered a large menu and quite the assortment of Chinese and Thai dishes.\n\nLocated at Valley View and Spring Mountain, you're close to one end of Chinatown.  For those who haven't ventured down Spring Mountain Road to see and sample the amazing assortment of Asian shops and restaurants, this may be a good place to start?  Three of us went in for lunch.  The restaurant was dark inside, almost under-lit, giving me the impression that they don't want folks looking around too closely.  It wasn't obvious, but it made me wonder if the place was dirty or not in good repair.  I couldn't tell.  Even thought there were only a few other customers at tables, it took a minute for someone from the staff to realize we had walked in the door.  Even so, the greeting was friendly and once noticed, we were quickly seated, drinks were put on the table and our orders were quickly placed.\n\nI ordered Beef and Green Beans off the Thai menu.  The food came out hot and tasted fine, and by fine I mean it was okay.  My honest impression was that the menu is large enough that many of what could be unique flavors for specific dishes may be blending together or lost for the cooks.  There were no unique Thai flavors in the dish I ordered and actually had to go back and look to be sure I ordered a Thai dish and not a Chinese dish.  Drinks were refilled regularly, there were no issues paying, and we were on our way after lunch without any unnecessary delay.\n\nWas it great?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  Would I go back?  Sure, if someone I was with wanted to eat there.  If you're in this part of town, I think this is probably a safe place to grab a sit-down meal that's going to be consistently good, but with all the other options very near by, I'm sure you can find restaurants with a more tailored approach to the specific dish or dishes you're after.\n\nOne final note:  the shopping center where Kung Fu is located can be busy.  It's not a problem, but depending on your luck with parking spots, be prepared to park down the storefront quite a ways if you're there at lunchtime."

We entered the establishment, 2 of us, and there was a party of 3 behind us.  The waiter said to us, \"Take that table there.\"  He pointed to a table by the wall, and I asked if that was the table he meant.  Yes!  He proceeded to seat the party of 3 while we seated ourselves, and he then brought us menus and took our drink order.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive, but we decided on appetizers of crab rangoon, bbq pork egg foo young, and Thai beef w/vegetables.  The table had been previously set with lunch size plates.  The waiter brought the appetizer, set it down and left.  We mixed the sweet & sour sauce with the mustard sauce on our plates and ate the crab rangoon.  It was just ok, but my husband removed half of the filling because it really was way too much in the won ton.  This extra filling he put on his plate.  We now have lunch plates with sauce and filling sitting in front of us.\n\nThe waiter returned with our food and just sat it on the table and left.  Not a word, no eye contact.  We looked at each other and said, OK, and proceeded to place our food and rice on the dirty plates.  Every wait staff in the place refused to give us any type of eye contact or acknowledge us.  My husband finally said, \"Do you get the feeling we are not wanted here?\"  \"OMG, Yes!\" I said.  It was so uncomfortable in there.  No one ever came over to see if we needed anything or to refill our tea.\n\nTo say the least, this was the worst Chinese and Thai food we have EVER had!  The egg foo young was so bland and almost had a water taste to it.  The brown gravy on was in was tasteless.  I actually added table salt to my beef and veggies in order to try and liven it up a bit.  We wanted some soy sauce, but do you think any person would even look at us?  NO!\n\nBUT, when it came time for us to leave all of a sudden we had all the smiles and help we needed.  Someone actually refilled our tea!  And, everybody was trying to wish a good evening, etc.  Guess the thought of a tip was overpowering to them.  Surprise!  The tip was $3, which was way too much!\n\nMy thoughts?  Stay away from this place as I am sure there are some fabulous places in Las Vegas for Thai and Chinese food!"

Now that we have eaten every animal on land and sea we got an order of Sauteed Chinese Broccoli. \n\nThe service is quick and attentive, Our water glasses were always full and dirty dishes were taken away quickly.

Everyone in the office is completely sick of Jason's Deli 3 days in a row, so we tried something different and so glad we did. I've only had the Thai food from Kung Fu, but it's one of the few places in Chinatown that delivers, and figured we'd give their food a try.\n\nWe did the order by phone since it was catering, but I was really surprised that their website allows you to do the order online for delivery or pick up. Helps a lot with the language barrier - I don't speak Chinese or Thai, but my coworker made me order (in English!) because she had trouble understanding them. \n\nWe were able to feed 12-14 people for about $160 which is really good. Delivery was on time and there was no minimum or delivery fee. I wasn't blown away by the Chinese food, but it was above average with generous servings at a really reasonable price. I think each half pan was around $40. \n\nIt's not my personal go-to for Chinese or Thai, but the fact that they're cheap, so close to the strip and have delivery makes this place 5-star if you're visiting. Beats paying $25 for sweet & sour chicken from a casino restaurant."

Anyway the attitude of the waitstaff is \"I don't care\"..they're the type that are only attentive if they feel like it, and if they're not they don't care about apologizing. Kinda like when you're in the checkout line at a store and you tell the cashier you've been waiting for a long time and she ignores your statement completely, rings you up, and sends you on your way. Thats the attitude here. Maybe its because they know they're in a good location, so business will come regardless of a few unhappy people. If you tell them they have horrible service they'll literally respond \"I don't care, we don't want you back anyway\"...then when YOU start to have an attitude one of them will follow you out the restaurant and scream \"Don't come back okay!!\"......thats right, I definitely won't!"

Penang Beef comes with Jasmine steamed rice, lovely.  \n\nI was really surprised to see so much Zucchini in my Penang Beef though.  My first serving, I had 2 small strips of beef, and the rest Zucchini.  Second serving yielded more beef, but not much.  I think the dish SHOULD have been called, \"Zucchini Penang with Beef\".  I very much enjoyed the dish, and the Spring Rolls though.\n\nI do love Thai and have enjoyed many Penang dishes in the Bay Area.  The spices were perfect (although I was questioned when I said I wanted a \"7\" on a scale of 1-10 for spice).  It is spicy, but not too spicy.  \n\nKudos to Kung Fu for their service.  I would rather have excellent customer service than amazing, knock-me-down food with crappy service.  Their food was good...and service excellent.  In this city, that's great!"

I have to say that the consistently good Thai dishes are enough for me to say that this is now my second favorite Thai restaurant!  Oh, and the Thai iced tea here is really, really good.  Perhaps the best I have had!  Very original taste, and just the right level of sweetness.\n\nThe tom kha chicken was excellent.  I think it beats even the versions at Komol and Prommares, and gets close to Thai Grill.  Thai Grill's broth is fuller and more sour, but what is great about the tom kha gai at Kung Fu is the super tender chicken chunks.  They must slow cook the chicken somehow, because it simply melts in your mouth.  It was amazing.  If only I could have this chicken in the Thai Grill broth!  \n\nThe panang with beef was good too.  There was a definite peanut flavor in the first bite or two, but that flavor quickly blended away as I kept eating.  I added chili powder to the curry to balance the slight sweetness.  The pairing of the chili powder taste and the curry was simply perfection.  I wouldn't say that the panang is especially unique in style, but for the style that it is, it is nearly as good as the panang at Komol (which is the best dish I have had at Komol).  The beef was also very well prepared and tender.  As you read on you will see that meat is one of the things that Kung Fu does exceptionally well.\n\nOn to the Rad Na! The Rad Na here was one of the few versions that I actually would order alone, and when you can order Rad Na by itself, it must be damn good!  Prommares still makes the best Rad Na in town, but this is a close tie for me with Thai Grill for second.  The noodles were fresh, and the sauce was lightly sweet, and flavorful.  There was lots of bright green, thick Chinese broccoli stems and leaves.  Very fresh and very good.  The pork, again, was incredibly tender.  Very high quality meats here at Kung Fu. \n\nKung Fu's Thai food is very strong, and authentic.  Every time I come here, there are large families/groups of Thai people eating.  People who don't know Thai food might not realize what they are eating, and I believe that the negative reviews here are a reflection of this.  I can tell you though, if you are a Thai food lover like I am, this place makes some fine Thai food.  \n\nOn the other hand, the food here is a bit heavier than the food at Thai Grill (and probably TSNH), and not as original as the recipes at my favorite Thai restaurant.  I think Thai Grill is uniquely healthy compared to Kung Fu (and most other Thai restaurants).  Between these two restaurants though, I can thoroughly satisfy my craving for Thai food.  I can't wait to try more Thai dishes at Kung Fu Thai and Chinese, especially the desserts.  \n\nUpdate: Losing a star for a couple of reasons.  I like the curry here, however it still doesn't have the unique flavor that I am looking for.  It is well done, but a little bit generic in style.  Secondly, the Thai menu is dwarfed by the Chinese menu.  I understand that this is where Kung Fu probably gets most of its business, but this means that Kung Fu can't offer as many Thai dishes as it should.  I find myself not wanting to go back because there is nothing new to try.  \n\nDisclaimer: this review and the prior one are for the Thai food only."

We love Thai food and either dine at Archi's restaurants or order in from Weera Thai, but ever since we came here last month, I prefer this place over anywhere else. \n\nWe ordered the chicken larb, which I can only describe as a Mexican shrimp ceviche except with chicken and a bit more spice. Granted, you can order your food based on a \"hot\" scale and we got the 7. Needless to say I absolutely love ceviche and am now in love with the chicken larb.\n\nIn addition to the larb, we also ordered chicken pad thai noodles. We ordered the noodles without any spice and the dish actually had a hint of sweet to it but in the most amazing, warm way. It was the perfect balance between spicy and sweet. All of this comes with a side of white steamed rice but we also ordered two side orders of sticky rice. I've recently discovered sticky rice when Weera Thai mistakenly placed some in my take-out bag and I haven't gone back to anything else since. Im Hispanic so I eat a lot of my foods with tortillas and that's what sticky rice reminds me of. Roll it in a ball, flatten it and grab! I also like to soak it in the larb juice. So amazing!! Also, the best Thai Tea ever and I am not a huge fan of Thai tea.\n\nThis is literally the first time I have ever had to tell someone to take a plate away from me or I was going to make myself sick from eating so much. \n\nAnd, finally, the most important part: the staff. \n\nThe staff was so nice! So, so nice! I am a firm believer that you can have the most amazing food but if your staff sucks, the entire experience sucks. I will admit that I don't know much about other cultures or what they believe so I am hesitant when going into restaurants like these because we are lesbians and I've had a bad experience before. But the waitress could not have been nicer. She was so sweet! So, so sweet!

            "review": "I went to Kung Fu because I, and two friends, were in the mood for Thai Food around 10 pm, and that was the first restaurant we saw when we arrived in Chinatown.   We shared chicken satay and fried won ton as appetizers, and shared three entrees:  chicken with spicy garlic, sweet and sour pork and seafood pad thai.  \n\nOur waiter was new to the job and had to be urged to check with someone to give us information about the drinks at the bar (rather than just saying \"I don't know\" and leaving us with that) but he redeemed himself by returning with the owner, who explained the ingredients of the pina colada, and told us that the pina coladas and mai tais are the most popular bar drinks requested.\n\nAs far as cleanliness, the nasty-looking carpeting was a problem. I believe the furnishings were rather worn-looking as well, but the space is brightly lit and relatively spacious.  The decor was nothing to write home about; the place is basically a white box with decorative Thai art and dusty-looking travel posters on the walls.\n\nBut we came for the food, and I must say that everything was delicious.   For all of the above orders, a beer and a Pepsi, the bill came only to about $50, which isn't bad.  We all said we'd come back."

I was craving tom yum soup and while going through their extensive detailed menu, I noticed they had tom yum NOODLE soup......never had it before so I decided to give it a try.  \n\nWe started off with papaya salad (medium spicy) with salted crabs.  I kept thinking the sliced green veggie was peas and wondered why the hell the salad was so damn spicy, turns out they were chilli peppers and NOT peas. ....oops.  the salad overall was tasty, fresh, and delicious.\n\nMoving on to the best noodle soup I've ever had in my whole entire life: TOM YUM NOODLE SOUP.  Words cannot express just how amazed I was.  It was extremely flavorful with the right amount of spices and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  I'm constantly looking for cheap flights so I can fly out there just for this.  \n\nService - You're average asian restaurant.   Poor guy had to go back and forth with our orders since we kept asking him for extra stuff.   But my experience here was pleasant.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."

Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating. \n\n  Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.\n\n  The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus. \n\n  Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table. \n\n  The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill. \n\n  I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, \"The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business.\" Or the fortune cookie might of said, \"You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city.\" Or the fortune cookie could of said, \"There is nothing like competition.\" To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time."

This little bowl is nothing like what you see in the Bay area in California. But for Las Vegas, I suppose this will do.\n\nThe first time I was still hungry when we left, but this time, We all ordered the crab papaya salad as well. With this and my noodle soup, I left happy and content. The soup was a little on the sweet side which I am not accustomed to or favor.\n\nI ordered my soup without bean sprouts, and it came with bean sprouts , I also asked for extra cilantro and they didn't give me any..\n\nIf you are not sure what you are craving.. you will definitely get lost in this menu. This thing is like 10 pages long, ranging from Thai curries, to soups to Chinese fried rices and more dishes!\n\nCome prepared with an idea of what you want..\n\nI'll probably try some more Thai places in the area next time I'm in town before coming back."

The style of service here is family style, but there are entrees for one serving available as well.\n\nAtmosphere: Vibrant, Organized\nThe decor of the restaurant seems to be based around Thai decor. Upon entering the restaurant, the decor is vermillion-colored. Nothing too flashy, but there are pictures and statues that seem to be Thai-themed. Nothing too obnoxious or flashy, but there is just enough decor around the restaurant to catch your eye.\n\nService: Good! \nUpon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately at a booth. When were seated, however, instead of the waiter asking us for what we wanted to drink, he just gave us all ice water. We were able to ask for hot tea (which one of us wanted) later upon request. The table where we were seated had plenty of space for us to sit. We took our time finishing our dishes, and when they needed to be cleared, they were cleared with efficiency. The only thing I did not enjoy would be the busser stacking dishes at the table. He should have brought a cart or a tray in case something might have splashed on us.\n\nFood: Well prepared, delicious, and memorable\nWe ordered the crab ragoons as our only appetizer. They were crispy on the outside with a creamy filling. Six were served to us on a bed of shredded cabbage with a side of horseradish sauce and sweet and sour sauce, both of which complimented the ragoons very well. What I liked about the service when we ordered the ragoons would be when the waiter told us that if we order wontons they would be plain and if we order the ragoons they would have filling. This was very considerate of him.\n\nThe two soups we order were the wonton soup and the tom yom with \"big\" rice noodles. The wonton soup came with shrimp, pork, carrots, baby bok choy, scallions, and pork wontons. The wonton soup was decent, but needed some salt and pepper. The tom yum we order was medium spiciness and came with fish balls, imitation crab, some ground pork, bean sprouts, scallions, and a fried wonton on top for garnish. The tom yum was incredible: full of flavor, a little savory with a complimentary kick of spiciness.\n\nThe dishes that we order were the chicken pad thai, Hon Sui Tofu, and beef and broccoli in oyster sauce. Chicken pad thai came with purple cabbage and parsley on the side. The pad thai had a good amount of chicken and seasoning. The Hon Sui had great juiciness in the tofu and great flavor in the meat: totally delicious and savory. The Beef and Broccoli was probably my favorite dish; the beef's smokiness and seasoning was absoutely amazing. The Beef and Broccoli in oyster sauce is a must try!\n\nOverall: Good experience, would go again!\nAlthough the service was not great, the food we were served was some great Asian cuisine. The food was probably some of the best I've had in a while. Visit this place for some great Thai and Chinese food!"

So sometimes we just can't hack it, and call in for some more-edible options. One of those places is Kung Fu. It had some good reviews and a full menu online, so we gave it a try.\n\nIt's exceptionally pleasing! Of course, I had to go with Pineapple Fried Rice (my favorite!) and theirs comes in huge portions with chicken, pork, shrimp, and crab! What a catch! (You see what I did there?) My coworker went with the pad thai and she liked it.\n\nThe best part is that delivery is in pretty reasonable time, and they deliver anywhere to the strip. It's a pretty good option, especially if you just want to chill in your hotel room before going out."

Noodle salad was only average.  My wife, who is Chinese, said the Thai food tasted like bad Americanized Chinese food - so salty she had to eat it with a lot of rice and three glasses of water (which saltiness is not typical of true authentic Thai).\n\nIt's a shame this formerly excellent restaurant has careened downhill."

So far, I think you can't really go wrong as pretty much all the Asian restaurants I've been brought to has yet to disappoint me. This place was no different.\n\nIt's one of the typical informal Asian restaurants you'll find in Chinatown....dated decor and nothing 5 star about it. That's fine as these places are frequented for the food and not the decor. Not to say there isn't any atmosphere as there's hodge podge of Thai and Chinese antiques and motifs.\n\nLike most Asian restaurants, it's probably best to go in larger groups as there are so many dishes to try and the portions are quite generous. Since it was just my friend and I, we just ordered the fish cakes, Pad See Ew (fried flat rice noodles) and the Pad Wan Sen (fried clear noodles). The flat rice noodles was pretty good, but just a bit sweet for my taste. I had actually ordered the fried clear noodles which were quite delicious. However, I had just had this this dish at another Thai restaurant a few days ago, and the other restaurant's taste edges out this one a bit in terms of taste quality. Still good though, and a good sized plate of noodles. The fish cakes were not too bad either, but for some reason parts of it were dry or hard to the chew. \n\nFor a good Thai and Chinese restaurant both in one, and not too far from the strip, then this is definitely a place I'd come to again. Service was good (likely because it wasn't a busy time of day), good sized portions, and the food was worth the money. The other Thai restaurant I really enjoyed was a good 4-5 miles from the strip in a suburban strip mall, and probably a bit too far from the strip to venture out to, unless you have a car and GPS. This place is convenient."

We went at night, so it was just our huge family of around 30 and another small family at a table near us.\n\nFoods I ate:\n-Tom Yum soup\n-Seasoned fish (forgot what it was called, but I hate fish and this was one of the only times I enjoyed eating it!)\n-MONGOLIAN BEEF *YES YES YES*\n\nI forgot all of the other dishes, but I'm sure that they all had just the right seasoning, texture, and taste.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try if you're ever in the area!"

I have been ordering delivery from this place for 5 years, I called tonight to place an order and the lady on the phone rudely told me we don't deliver to you anymore! I tried to explain to her that they have delivered to me 2-3 a month for the last 5 years, she now starting yelling at me and said I told you 20 times we do not deliver there and hung up on me. I work In a casino/hotel on the strip and have always recommended them to guests and also ordered huge orders for my department! They charge for delivery but have always tipped 20-25 percent. I am so disappointed in this establishment of how they treated me and I will pass it on to everyone I know! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! You lost a great customer! Zero stars for you Kung Fu, you should be ashamed of your behavior!!!!!!!!!"

Heard good things about it and fellow colleagues always go, so today me and Ellen F. decide to check it out. \n\nLocated on the southwest corner in the strip mall on Valley View and Spring Mountain, can't miss it with a name like Kung Fu on the outside. We were seated right away, place wasn't too busy so a waiter took our drink orders promptly. \n\nThe place looks old school but don't care about that, has a lot of Thai decor with elephants and pictures of the motherland. I get the feeling this place is geared more toward Thai than Chinese but who knows. If you want pad Thai don't fall for the trap and order it from the menu as they offer it as a lunch special for $6.95 Mon-Fri 11am-3pm. I fell for this and ordered the combo pad Thai with an order of rice, it was huge!! Enough for two people. \n\nI doubt the lunch portion is as big but still much cheaper and comes with soup or an egg roll. The pad Thai was very good, along with the rice, the quantity was more than enough and the bill was reasonable. We will be returning during lunch hours to take full advantage of the specials. If your looking for a cheap meal in Chinatown with no frills it's worth a stop."

Mongolian Beef - NOTHING...and I mean NOTHING- tops their MB.\n2. Tom Yum Soup with Tofu - I cry because San Francisco doesn't know how to make it like Vegas does. I have tried numerous Thai restaurants in SF and gave up because they all use some kind of tomato tasting broth that totally turns my taste buds off. It was heartbreaking when I moved away from LV. Kung Fu knows exactly how to make my spicy and sour broth!! (Try Komals if you want the very best Tom Yum in LV)\n3. Orange Chicken - Very strong flavored orange glaze over crispy chicken. YUM!!!\n4. Thai Vegetable Fried Rice with egg - love it!\n\nWhile visually its not the greatest looking restaurant, don't mind that because what's looks got to do with it?!?\n\nService always weighs heavily on my mind when forming opinions about restaurants, business etc. that I go to, and I can't emphasize enough that the staff here just gets is right- 100% of the time...for me anyways, but maybe the just like me ;)"

I can't stand the name of the restaurant, but the food is not too shabby. A few years ago, I thought this place was the bomb, but I think because of the combination of food we ordered, I left feeling underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't so spectacular either. This restaurant offers both Thai and Chinese cuisine.\n\nGotta have Tom Yum. We ordered the seafood. For 13 bucks, they didn't give us much soup, and the seafood was sparse, but it tasted alright. \n\nThe Pad Thai was decent. Kind of hard to mess up pad thai.\n\nMy sister ordered the Cashew Chicken. This was just an average dish. \n\nThe Pan-fried Catfish was everyone's favorite. The fish wasn't perfectly fried by a long shot, but the sauce was very good. I'm not sure why it says that the sauce is \"curry like\" on the menu, but it was a bit spicy, and the basil added fragrance. I love spicy! \n\nOk, let me tell you about this dish that hubby ordered. He has a history of ordering bad dishes. This was the Pa Nang Curry with Beef. It was like scooping a spoonful of peanut butter into my mouth. My mom said it was \"so weird\" in Vietnamese. It was.\n\nLots of photos and full review on my blog."

Since I'm always game to try things that people seem to be so passionate about, I thought why not?\n\nFirst I will say that the parking was a bit confusing. Kung Fu is located in a strip mall on Spring Mountain but the actual restaurant faces Decatur. You can't actually see it from the parking so you really have to know that it's there or you would totally miss it.\n\nAfter looking through the pretty extensive menu we decided on the Crab Rangoon for an appetizer, the half duck and the chicken Pad Thai. Well one of my pet peeves is when the appetizer arrives the same time as the entree which is what happened here. I still can't figure out why anyone would rave about the duck. It was super rubbery and none of the fat was rendered. The Pad Thai was solid however but not enough of a reason to come back. And lastly, the service was not very attentive. We even had to wave someone down to get our check.\n\nChina Town has so many great restaurants in the area but this one is not going to be on my radar in the future unfortunately."

A cab driver had just recommended this place 3 days before. They have Beef Tendon Soup so I knew that would be perfect (I'd never had it). When I saw online ordering- whoohoo! No language/accent barriers with ordering . I also got Jumbo Shrimp Curry and Tom Yum Mixed Seafood Soup, and my daughter got Orange chicken and egg roll. What a great meal and the delivery time was fast. It exceeded  my expectations and I absolutely loved the curry, and the soup was also very good. We'll definitely be repeat customers."

The food is okay.. they have a lot of options for family style. We always order well over 10 dishes since we come in a big group, which gives us a lot of variety. Some items worth trying are the beef salad, chicken larb, spicy cat fish, and minced chicken."

            "review": "We went to our favorite restaurant in China town in honor of the Chinese New Year celebrations going on downtown over the weekend. I have to admit, I was disappointed that there wasn't a special offered or some type of unique meal for the occasion. But none the less, we all decided to try something different than our \"norm\" on this trip and it was Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp - we've always seen and admired it at other people's tables, so decided to give it a try. On the scale of spice, we asked for medium. I'm not much of a spicy person - medium turned out to be way too much for both my mother and I. In fact, my sister, who loves spice, tried it and it was way too much for her. It ended up ruining our dinner this night. My lips were numb from my small sampling of it and I couldn't taste anything more the rest of the night.\n\nWe were surprised that it wasn't crowded when we arrived, however, by the time we left almost every table was filled. Although I've given the restaurant four stars, this night didn't really deserve a one star. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order. Others arrived after us, received their food before us and were on their way out the door as we were finally being served our main course. For me - this is an automatic negative review for me unless circumstances occurred causing the delay. But this was before the place got really busy. It took another 30 minutes after we were done to have our table cleared and ask for the bill. And another 15-20 minutes after receiving the bill to flag someone down to take our payment. I think we only saw our waiter once the entire night. The rest of the servers were people we had to flag down for one reason or another. \n\nAlthough the soup ended up ruining the rest of the meal, I can tell you the food there has always been wonderful! Appetizers of Crab Rangoon, Calamari, Wings (really good), Satay and combo platters have always been tasty. We make it a must to have at least one appetizer each time we go. The Pad Thai is really good - they even give you a choice of the type of noodles to have with it. Mongolian Beef is awesome! So is the Ginger and Pepper Pork/Chicken or Beef (we've had one of each). Egg Fu Young (whichever type you have) is moist, delicious and so flavorful. Overall - we really love the restaurant. Just wasn't at its best this past Saturday evening."

I went with my good gf and we had a quick lunch break to chat and enjoy good cheap eats! This was the lunch time and considering it being the peak time where people from office or casinos have their lunch break most restaurants were not open? It was odd so we knew that Kung Fu had never let us down and was great to eat. We had the lunch specials where you can have a soup, egg roll and chicken wing with steam or fried rice and an entree of your choice. The entree was either Chinese or Thai to choose from. And the order was quick and fast. There were several patrons there on their lunch break too and looked like they were having the lunch special too?! It's only $7.25 and anything other than the lunch special depending on the entree should be around $7 and up. They also deliver! That's an added Plus when you can't get out of the office and or job. Super recommend!"

After waiting for ten minutes to get our drink order taken, we were greeted by the rudest server ever. He kept getting our order wrong and had to repeat several times. Two of our plates  came out in a timely fashion, but we waited for all plates to come out so we could all eat together. Not an unreasonable request. 30 minutes of waiting for the rest of our order and our waiter hadnt even come to check on us. There had been 3 parties seated and served in the time that we were waiting. After 45 minutes of waiting for the other 4 plates, we asked the  waiter if we could just pay for our drinks because we weren't  going to pay for food we hadnt receieved. Somehow they magically had two more of our plates ready as we were standing up to walk out.  The waiter first tried to ignore our request, then hid in the kitchen. We were very calm in out request and just kept getting blown off. A lady came out of the kitchen and shook her hand at us as to dismiss us. Thats when our waiter came out with our checks for our drinks. \n\nWe paid for our drinks and left. \n\nAs you can imagine, we wont be returning. What a disappointment!"

At 9:45 I called to check on the status of my meal, they said a driver was out with my food. \n\nOn pressing them, they asked the driver (Who was actually at the restaurant), and then insisted several times I had signed for the food. When I sternly pressed that I had not received the meal, they had put the driver on the phone. The driver immediately described the wrong house and gave me my neighbors' address (The store owner had the right address, which was not my neighbor.)  The driver then suggested, an hour after he had delivered it, that I should go to my neighbor's house and ask for my food.  \n\n  After having ordered here for at least five years, I would have at least hoped for a discount or a free appetizer. They charged me full price for the meal and offered to remake it and redeliver.  I think most people would have declined the charge outright.  \n\nI hope they manage to sort out their drivers. Almost four hours for a meal is insane. Furthermore, they did not deliver the correct drink.

A guy came for several times, we paid a good tip and there were no issues, and then, out of the blue, the person answered the phone told us they they could not deliver to our area, it was \"too far.\"  When we pointed out to them that they had delivered several times before, the person on the phone informed us categorically that they had never delivered to that area and accused us of lying.

A local recommending a good thai restaurant - it MUST be good. she also recommended the stuffed fried chicken wings which also sounded bomb.\n\nGPSed this place and went with 4 other people. I first looked for the chicken wings under appetizer and found it: Stuffed fried chicken wings (2). WHAT THE HELL. 8.95 for 2 wings? Whatever, we ordered it anyway since the dealer recommended it. I ordered the laad na with beef (flat noodles topped with gravy sauce with beef), my bf ordered the pad thai with chicken, my other 2 friends ordered pad see ew with chicken, and the other ordered roast duck over fried rice.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say, it took almost half an hr just for the waitress to come to our table to get our order. Second, it took another 45 min for the food to come. The thai ice tea came out pretty quick though and was pretty tasty.\n\nThe stuffed fried chicken wings came out first. Man, that was a small portion. We all took 1/5 of the wing and it was mediocre.\n\n30 min later,  My laad na was finally came and was DISGUSTING. I dont think ive ever had nastier laad na than this place. It was bland, the noodles were not pan fried at all, and the beef was dry and overcooked. My bf's pad thai was soso. The pad see ews came with 90% noodles, 5% veg, and 5% chicken. The duck fried rice looked disgusting also. I think the only tasty item in this restaurant is their thai ice tea.\n\n-2 for food, - 2 for service, and +1 for thai ice tea."

Therefore, I have mixed feelings about this place because food is good, but being in the heart of Chinatown; I'm certain there are better options/hidden gems around the same price range. \n\nWe didn't love the broth of the vegetarian Tom Yum Kha soup bc it lacked coconut milk. From the reviews, it seems like the non-vegetarian version is the way to go.  Our main dishes were much better, getting usuals like Pad Thai, Chinese Cabbage, and Beef & Broccoli.

Their menu said the shrimp pad thai and shrimp fried rice comes with plump shrimp ...what we got in these dishes looked very small and not as advertised---very disappointing.  The flavors were good though but they shouldn't have underlined \"plump shrimp\".  The cat fish was very good and almost made up for the shrimp.

Seafood combo dishes mostly imitation, however.\n4) Portion size varies anywhere from meh to very good; meat ratios vary even more wildly.\n5) Online ordering system is fantastic for convenience.\n6) They deliver fast and have never gotten the order wrong, and reliable delivery is a rarity in Vegas.\n\nYa, probably averages out somewhere a bit above a 3*, but I think rounding up to 4* is a bit too generous especially since I avoid the Chinese food.

Came across some good reviews for Kung Fu so I placed an online order.\n\nAbout two minutes after the order was placed, a gentleman called from Kung Fu to verify some of the things on my order. Whhaaaaat? A restaurant that doesn't just guess but actually follows up with the customer? Amazing! He told me the food would be delivered in an hour but it was more like 30-45 minutes.\n\nAnd it was sooooo good. I was craving egg drop soup and theirs didn't disappoint. I had also ordered the chicken with chili and mint over rice and received a HUGE portion for the price. Got a large drink too.

He was an older Asian man who proceeded to complain and moan about my delivery to no end. I pretty much closed the door on him. I felt like I was being scolded by my father or something. He complained about things I couldn't control like the fact that my complex is too dark for him to see the building and he complained about how he had to drive SO far (not even 20 minutes). When I apologized for the inconvenience I had caused him he just repeated how far I made him drive. I will never give this restaurant my business again because of that driver.

We stayed at The Hard Rock and they have Chinese food there but its expensive and nowhere as good as Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant !! We had both Thai and Chinese. The fried rice was light and not heavy with oils as many seem to make.It was so flavorful. When we first walked in the smells wafted in the air and we knew right away that we found the best! Worth the drive from the overpriced strip and an Uber ride is cheap and with the money you save by not paying over inflated LV strip prices the Uber ride ends up almost free. We will always stop here each trip we make. This was our Thanksgiving mealand one I will always remember. Thank you to the cooks and all the nice people we met there!!"

It was absolutely amazing, and I usually don't care too much for hot/spicy things.  \n\nThe Mongolian beef was delicious:  tender beef with great flavor and a little kick to it, with peppers and onions and carrots.  \n\nThe Shrimp Pad Thai was good too...the noodles were perfect.

Also, I'm not entirely sure if the take-out menu has all the items that are in the in-house menu. I have never been to the restaurant itself. Decided to try the take-out menu because one of us was feeling sick and was not up to going to the casinos for a meal. We were staying at a timeshare near the strip that did not have room service.\n\nFirst, I tried ordering online because they have a convenient online ordering system through their website at kungfuplaza.com. The ordering system was very well organized, with pictures of the food you're ordering. However, after putting in my order, the final page indicated that the delivery address was my credit card's billing address which is in another state and not the hotel that I was staying in. I cancelled the order and called in the order instead. The woman who took the order had a strong accent, but she got my order right. The woman asked for spiciness level on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being really spicy. I was quite tickled by this method. Food arrived exactly an hour later as promised. There is a charge for delivery; I think it was six dollars or thereabouts. If paying by credit card over the phone, the delivery person will ask to see the credit card that you paid with along with a picture id. \n\nThe dishes were good; nothing spectacular, but sufficient for a take-out. The seafood tom yum had very little seafood but quite tasty. The roast pork noodle was okay. Pad Thai was quite good, and so was the beef larb. Portions were good, neither too little nor too much.  Thai iced-tea was delicious. The restaurant included Styrofoam bowls and plates, and plastic forks, knives, and spoons. They also did not skimp on the paper napkins, fortune cookies, and hot pepper sauce.  All in all, a good take-out experience and I would definitely order take out from them again. For the four dishes, drinks, a side-order of  steamed rice, and delivery charge, dinner was about fifty dollars."

Tom Yum Soup w/ Soup - 2 Stars\n- Probably the worst Tom Yum soup I've ever had. Watery in taste and only had mushrooms. I think we ordered the Shrimp one but do you see any floating or drowned shrimps. Neither did we. No heat, no flavor, the flattest soup ever\n\n02.  Water Spinach - 2.5 Stars\n- One of my FAVE Asian Veggies if not my FAVE Thai veggie dish. It was limp and watery. No flavor that seemed to come to our taste but just bland. It tasted like steamed Water Spinach. \n\n03.  Pad See Ew (Beef) - 3 Stars\n- Probably the best dish of our lunch. At least it tasted more like what Pad See Ew should taste like but theirs was more on the sweet side.\n\n04.  Beef Salad - 2 Stars\n- CHEWY Beef and not even spicy. It kinda like a non-Thai dish to me. Just horrible in taste. We didn't finish it.\n\n05. Chicken Basil - 3 Stars\n- 2nd best of our meal. It was really sweet and not spicy as most Chicken Basil is. The hint of Basil wasn't enough to give it a fragrant smell. Was hoping this dish was better than the rest. \n\n06.  Sweet & Sour Chicken - 2 Stars\n- This took 30 minutes to come out and when it finally did, it was such a disappointment. SOGGY, SWEET, and STICKY. 3 \"S\" is not ever good. The kids didn't even like it. Another one we tossed away.\n\n07.  Some SWEET Fish they recommended - 1 Star\n- Couldn't even tell it was fish, it had some weird sweet sticky sauce that was just too hard to eat through. The fish had a lot of bones. This was the 2nd WORST dish of our lunch. \n\n08.  Thai Ice Tea - 3 Stars\n- The only thing that tasted authentic today. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE - HORRIBLE and they were so slow.\n\nFOOD - Nothing there was authentic. I get it, it's a touristy area and loads of buses come through here. Anywhere that is a combo of 2 countries, usually isn't good. In this case, it was absolutely true...NOT GOOD.\n\nVERDICT - Never coming back and Never listening to my friends that recommended this place to us. I cut them some slack, they are not Yelpers so failures like this could happen. Won't happen again, though. Thanks but NO thanks!"

I am so disappointed because I was expecting their menu to have basic chinese dishes like crispy house noodles, crispy duck, honey walnut shrimp, and bbq pork. Everything I wanted was not available or was altered from what I was used to. We ended up ordering chicken chow mein, kung fu duck and orange chicken. The chow mein was oily and reminded me of the chow mein you get at the fast food mall food court. The duck was good, wished that it was crispy. The orange chicken was overcooked and somewhat burnt. It contained mostly batter. A problem we had was that we ordered the duck quarter size because it was just my husband and I and they ended up giving us the half size. We thought it was big but we were hungry and no one came to check on us for us to let them know. We never realized it was half until we got the check and we already ate half so we just paid for it without complaining because it took them almost ten minutes to grab our payment. This is definitely a place I will not be coming back fo chinese again."

I was also surprised with the portion sizes as they were pretty generous at a reasonable price point. \n\nWe ordered the Tom Yum Kha which had a very traditional Thai flavor. We also ordered beef and broccoli, pat see ew and the Thai beef salad which were all good choices. The best dish was the combination fried rice which was very tasty. We also had the sweet green chicken curry which was somewhat of a disappointment and I would not recommend it. I guess the part that I did not enjoy was the fact that they used cucumbers for this dish. \n\nOther than the curry, the flavors were great with mainly all of their dishes. So whenever you cannot decide between Chinese or Thai food, you can come to this restaurant and have the best of both worlds! Again, not a fancy place but this is a good and reasonable priced restaurant."

We got seated and we were promptly brought water however we waited about fifteen minutes for someone to come by to take our drink and food order. After about twenty, a server finally came over and took everything at once. \n\nAfter another fifteen minutes, still no drinks so I got up and asked where they were, and as soon as she brought the food is when we got our drinks. The food was decent, however we had to get up, travel to a dirty table, and get our own soy sauce. Also the portions were pretty small. I ordered the general tso chicken and she had the bbq pork wonton soup.\n\nThe food like I said, was decent. It's just the service was so awful I couldn't take it, I honestly considered just walking out. There were only about 4 servers on the floor and obviously they were very overwhelmed. The bussers were amazing though, they really hustled their asses off. \n\nNext time hopefully the management staffs up for higher volume because I know this place has been in business for a long time and has great potential. Perhaps on a slower day we will check them out again if we are in the area."

A DEFINITE must-have in your Vegas trip's arsenal of contingency plans for when you are too hung over to leave the hotel for food, too broke or sick of the room service food, and you want variety.  They have an extensive menu, and they DELIVER?!?  \n\nI expected the Mr. Chau/Panda Express equivalent of Chinese fast food, so I was not excited whatsoever.  When the boyfriend read off the menu options and said they had an extensive Thai menu as well, I already knew what I wanted: Their green coconut curry w/ chicken.  I don't remember what the hell else everyone ordered, but it was all in my belly quick, and the coconut curry was the BEST I've had, hands down.  The chicken was tender and moist, the veggies were crisp, and the curry itself was a sweet and spicy blend of perfection.  Not too salty, and not too bland.\n\nI was surprised the price we paid, and bitter we wasted almost double that on 3/4 less food from room service the night prior.  We also waited JUST AS LONG for our food, too!  \n\nDefinitely put this place on your speed-dial when you're there.  It was nice to have a break from the traditional American food fare at all the buffets, and even better: it saved us $$$ when feeding a grip of hungry and broke people chillin' in our hotel room.  \n\nConvenience, price, speed, service, good Asian food = 5 stars."

Then the waiting game it took a very long time to get the food. The lunch special comes with egg and flour soup which we received first. It was bland and not very good, had to add soy sauce to it to make it even palatable. About 30 plus minutes later we received our entrees. The food was underwhelming at best. I had the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice, egg roll and Thai fried chicken wing. The chicken wing and egg roll were not too bad, but the rest was sub par and not very good. I believe I could have gotten a better meal at an Asian fast food restaurant. Then it took close to 15 minutes to get our check, followed by another long wait to get it back. It caused one of my coworkers to miss a meeting. Not sure how this place has made it as long as it has."

My husband said, \"Don't look down.\" Good advice.\n\nMoving beyond the floor, which I am sure at times is immaculate, we came in to try some Thai. When I go for Thai, I go for curry. I ordered the panang tofu, as that was the curry listed under their vegetarian selections. I forgot to ask if they were able to do soft tofu instead of fried, and the dish came with fried. I thought the tofu was perhaps over-fried, as the texture was a bit chewy, and the flavor a little greasy. As for the curry itself, it had a very heavy peanut flavor. Based on what I know, the inclusion of peanuts in curry is sometimes a personal preference of the chef, and some people may enjoy the flavor. However, for me, it was overly sweet and the curry was incredibly thick. I kept telling my husband that it tasted like peanut butter and tofu, which wasn't pleasing to my taste buds. This is not a dish I would order again.\n\nThe service was efficient.\n\nOne bad dish and some lackluster floors creates a less than ideal first impression. Still, there is a whole menu of potential, so as I said in the beginning, I'll stay neutral."

I also want to say that by far, they have my FAVORITE Tom Yum and Yum Woonsen. Order it every time. No other restaurant makes it as good as they do. But to the docking of stars. My husband no longer wants to dine here after basically being ignored one visit. We were barely acknowledged, just enough so that we finally got to place an order after being seated for 20 minutes ( again, we know what we want and just wasn't approached prior to this.) When we got our food, I was willing to dismiss the lack of service in the beginning, because the food is just so dang good and  I had an ok history with them. Buuuut, we weren't even on their radar during the meal. Our waters were not once refilled (or offered), no one asked how our meal was, or even if we would like anything else. Nothing. My husband was furious. We talked to them about how we felt neglected from the awful service, and their decision? Give us 10% off. Um. Ok. We are very reasonable people and are pretty polite, even if it comes down to complaining. Had we had a large bill, 10% would have been sufficient. But for two meals, they basically covered tax. Poor customer service recovery, in my opinion, especially for someone that has frequented there often. \nReally disappointed."

The panang curry doesn't have any curry favor\u200b, it was made by the peanut butter. The combination fried rice has too much moisture in it. Garlic chicken little too favorful, but if eat it with rice. It will be fine. Pai Thai was kinda disappointing. It lacks favor and it doesn't taste like Pai Thai. It tastes like Chow mein instead.

The Thai wings and fried shrimp were just huge blots of fried  cold batter.... lots of dried out boiled rice and two very small containers of tasteless, limp cold food.  THEN they hit me up for a $4 delivery charge............\n\nGO TO WEERA - HEARD EXCELLENT THINGS AND WILL TRY IT NEXT TIME.  KUNG FU THAI - YOU SUCK!!!"

Not amazing, just good.\n\nA lot of solid expected sightings like lo mein noodles, sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, & eggrolls.\n\nAgain, nothing that I had was amazing but I was very pleased with the more than acceptable quality of the items available.  Nothing seemed to be sitting for long periods of time and all of the foods were being served at the appropriate temperature.\n\nOverall: Decent offering of Chinese buffet food at affordable prices.  Great place to stuff your face full of okay food.  Thumbs up for not making me feel like puking afterwards as most low end Chinese buffets do."

I went a few weeks ago though and found the waitress a leetle on the rude side, but everything else was fine.\n\nThis place has a large menu and has thai dishes, but also some chinese ones as well! I guess that makes sense since the place is called kung fu? Lol.\n\nIve tried multiple items and liked everything. I am boring and almost always get a pad thai though. Found the noodles to be a little sog this last visit, but flavor was good."

            "review": "Yum! I had the pleasure of trying this place out when a couple of my coworkers decided to order some take out! The shrimp and pad Thai was my option of entree! I also ordered the fried wontons which I wish I would've got more clarification that they weren't the ones with the cream cheese because i was slightly disappointed once they arrived. For future reference I was told to order the crab ragoons if I wanted the cream cheese. I dinged them for a few stars because the delivery driver took over 2hrs for the order to arrive and then the customer service I received over the phone was horrible. The food is what would get me to return if I ever do!"

They have Chinese and Thai and everything I've tried is delicious and good quality, service can be better though. The place is very outdated carpet looks dirty and overall needs a good remodel to make it more appealing to come back. They can accommodate large groups."

When we were waited on, the food came out quickly and was really good.  My office is close by so normally, I have it delivered.  It's a little pricey that way but the portions are much bigger.  I wind up having tons of leftovers.  \n\nMongolian beef is my favorite.  The Tom Kha is really good too.  Totally worth trying."
