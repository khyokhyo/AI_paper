            "review": "While in Vegas I had to try Mesa Grill. I'm a huge Food Network fan, and I've always seen Bobby Flay work so much with chipotle peppers, that I had to see what this place was about.\n\nWe went for lunch on a Monday afternoon and the place wasn't that crowded. We were sat promptly and our server came to ask if we had ever been to the restaurant before. Nope.... That we haven't. He explained the menu items and the favorites everyone orders. There was also a three course special they were offering, but that sounded like too much.\n\nBoyfriend and I ordered the Mesa Margarita and it came out in a heart beat. This is def one of the smoothest best margaritas that I've had, but I thought it needed some \"kick\". Figured it would come out with a chipotle salted rim or something. I mean it IS Bobby Flay. But overall really happy with my drink.\n\nAs soon as the waiter came back we ordered. Boyfriend got the Salmon and I got the Mesa Burger. It was really tough for me ordering off this menu, because all the menu items are so complex which is why I guess many people love it here. But I'm more of a plain Jane, so the burger seemed fail proof. After ordering we were given a basket of bread with blue corn muffins, raisin bread, and a jalapeno bread. Jalapeno was right up my alley, but the rest weren't hitting the spot. Not a fan of blue corn, not a fan of raisins, so that's really MY fault. Shrugs.\n\nAfter the good components of the bread were gone, and the margarita gave me that nice little buzz everyone needs when they're in Vegas eating lunch, we waited... and waited.. and waited....\n\nA family of 5 set down next to us about 10 minutes after we arrived, and got their food well before us. Actually finished it before ours came out. Another couple ordered after us as well and were gone before our food came out. We spent a good 1.5 hours there, and most of that was waiting on our food. Something like 45 minutes? The server came out a few times letting us know that it would be 'right out'.... Not sure what happened. Maybe someone lost the ticket.. but I think the server was pretty irresponsible for not checking with the back after the 20 minute wait mark.\n\nAll in all I think this is a great little get away in Vegas. If my pallet was more up to par, I would have enjoyed my food more. Horseradish mayo = ewwwie. My boyfriend's salmon did not have any sides with it, and for $22 I expected more from his plate. My favorite part was my chipotle salted french fries. Not sure if I'll be back for an actual meal, but next time I'll get some chips, salsa and a few margaritas."

            "review": "I want to be upfront and let everyone know I'm probably a little biased with this review. I watch a lot of food porn (food network) and Bobby Flay is king. \n\nWent to Mesa Grill at 945pm for a late dinner. Thought the waiters may be ready to go home but that wasn't the case at all. We had great service the entire meal. \n\nWe stared with 2 shrimp tamales. 1 wasn't enough. \n\nI had the ribeye (sauces on the side). Best SW steak I've had. My wife got the coffee rubbed filet also deadly. \n\nOverall this was a great culinary experience and I'll be back."

            "review": "Been here a few times, and I've loved it each time. Tonight's particular occasion was to celebrate my boyfriend's mom's birthday. We originally had our hearts set on going to Bacchanal, the buffet inside Caesar's Palace, but the line was ridiculously long. So we checked out the wait at Mesa Grill, and the tables were filled, but they were able to seat us without too long of a wait--thankfully!!! I was famished!!\n\nRight in the heart of Caesar Palace's casino, the decor is colorful and inviting. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. The dress code can be anywhere from casual to dressy. We were dressed casually, but never felt that we were underdressed. The atmosphere felt easy and had an eclectic array of patrons!\n\nWe started off with classic margaritas. Not too tart or too sweet, but refreshing. They brought out a bread basket which came with an assortment of cornbread, a jalape\u00f1o bread, and a raisin bread--all done with a southwestern flair. The jalape\u00f1o bread definitely had a kick!\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the shrimp and grits. It was one of the specials they had for the night. Two jumbo sized shrimp on a bed of corn and grits, with a spicy, chile type of sauce with hints of cilantro and peanuts (which gave it a Thai kind of flair, I think).\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the blue corn crusted halibut. It was served on top of a \"warm salsa cruda\" which was a mixture of olives, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, and capers. The blue corn crust added a delightful crisp to the fresh and flaky halibut, and it's flavor and texture were only complimented by the salsa. Delicious! I also ordered a tamale as a side. It had some jalape\u00f1o butter melted right into the tamale--yum! My boyfriend had another one of the specials: the pork chops. It was served with vegetables and potatoes, and had a nice smokey, spicy flavor. My boyfriend's mom had the salmon with a side of mashed potatoes. The salmon was grilled and slightly charred, which added a good smokey flavor to her dish, as well. The mashed potatoes were also delicious!\n\nAt this point, we were pretty stuffed but my boyfriend's family is friends with Chef Augustine, and he brought out 3 different kinds of dessert: a strawberry tarte, an assortment of sorbets, and a coconut cake. The strawberry tarte was my favorite. It reminded me of a fancy strawberry shortcake, a buttery tarte shell, filled with a strawberry compote type of consistency, topped with a fresh whipped cream. The sorbet assortment came with 3 different favors: coconut, raspberry, and mango habanero (which was such a strange and exciting burst of flavor lol). The coconut cake consisted of several layers with a coconut creme anglaise and toasted coconut--not to sweet, great with coffee, a must for coconut lovers!\n\nFinally, for the service. They've got the friendliest, knowledgable, and thoughtful group of servers, hosts, and food runners. \n\nEverything about this place is pretty great. You gotta give it a try!"

            "review": "i was extremely disappointed with my experience here - and this is coming from someone who has eaten here before and enjoyed it back then (albeit, that was 7 years ago...). \n\nthe menu selection was minimal - barely two pages to cover the entire menu of drinks, starters, entrees, and desserts. i barely found anything i wanted to eat with such few items to choose from. however, i was there with a group for a birthday so i had to find *something* and be quiet about it. i decided to get a soup and an appetizer and eat them both as my meal.\n\nunfortunately, however, i did not end up eating any of the food that was brought to me. \n(1) the corn soup i received was cold the first time it arrived, so i sent it back for a warm one. however, it was overly sweet and tasted more like a dessert soup than a starter. it was also too spicy, i would have preferred a milder soup that allowed the natural sweetness of the corn to shine. \n(2) i also had a smoked chicken quesadilla that was SO overly smoked that i thought i was eating pork. the chicken was also overcooked and dry. i took two bites and left the rest. \n(3) finally, i got the peach mojoto which must have been 4 parts sugar to 1 part mojito. it was like drinking pure cane syrup.\n\ni will not be returning here, and i will not be recommending it to any of my friends, either. my share of the dinner was $50 and i had two spoon fulls of soup, two bites of quesadilla, and a sip of mojito. such a waste...\n\ni'm giving two stars instead of one because our server was a very nice lady, and she made sure our party of 8 was tended to regularly."

            "review": "Like many Las Vegas restaurants whose homes are inside the luxury hotels along the strip, Mesa Grill has an impressive space decked out in top-of-the line furniture and decor complete with a seating lounge area and full bar. Our group of 8 made a reservation here for brunch on a Saturday. We waited around 10 minutes in the lounge before getting seated. The menu for brunch had great variety ranging from your typical breakfast items with eggs, to lunch items like hamburger and dinner-like items like salmon and roasted chicken but of course each choice is riddled with Bobby Flay flair. I'm not a big fan of tex mex, so I opted for the Hamburger. LIke my review, this burger was A-OK. I didn't favor the ciabatta bread and there really wasn't anything too special about the meat or fixings. The fries on the other hand was a nice change. It had a chipotle dusting over it and what impressed me most was the horseradish mustard. I've never had anything quite like it before. Other than the food and decor, our service was top-notch. Out main waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and always there to bring us everything we needed. The busboys were attentive with the drinks/water and clearing out the food. I probably wouldn't go here again just because I was not that impressed with the food but it was more due to my own taste. I'd recommend it for others to try though."

Convenient if you stay at Cesar Palace. 4 star.\n* Meals: flavorful, quality, rich and savory! Not many choice for vegetarians though. 4 + star. \n* Service: excellent! Constantly serving waters, drinks. Orders and food coming out at constant pace! Best service by far! 5 star. \n\nThis is averaged to 4 1/2  star... extra 1/2 star for their excellent service and accommodating!\n\nYou gotta try thus place once when you are in Las Vegad! Is it the best food I'd ever had ... not really!\nBut dining at one of the best iron chef... it is an experience itself! \n\nWe came here for 4th of July dinner while staying at Cesar Palace.  RSVP via OpenTable since we could not get through the phone. The bar is beautiful. Our servers are friendly and attentive.  They work as a team... so when our server was busy, other servers came to fill up drinks,  clear the table, bring our food out! Best service by far!\n \nWe had Sophie 's chopped salad, honey glazed salmon and rib eyed steak. The chopped salad is fresh with diced roman salads, cheese cubes, peas... A but busy! The salmon is cooked perfect with a bit of salsa on top to give some tangy and spicy taste! Rib eyed steak is perfectly cooked, very tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned... what you would expect from Iron Chef! For side dishes, we had saute spinach and corn. Everything is savory and perfectly cooked! \n\nOverall, it is a great experience... worth to try it once...!"

The bartender David was super cool and very knowledgeable. We tried a couple different tequila's, as they have a good selection. He gave us a few recommendations on the menu and he was right on. Very cool guy!\nWe had the squash blossoms for an app and they are very tasty. The sauce had amazing flavor. I had the huge NY steak and it was perfect. The homemade steak sauce was so good. It also came with a twice baked potato, tasty. B-friend  had the pork tenderloin and it was the best ever. Huge cuts and it also was served with two great sauces. Food had so much flavor!\nService was very good and the decor is nice. Seating is a bit tight and you do need a reservation. You can eat at the bar, but there are only like 8 seats. I could not have been any happier!\nVery nice wine list too!!"

            "review": "Bobby Flay comes off as arrogant premadonna...his attitude on TV comes through as someone who's got a chip on his shoulder...\n\nYes, he may be egocentric but I'm giving him this; He has mastered the craft of blending southwestern flavors in ways never seen before!\n\nAfter deciding to take my old man to Vegas for his 55th birthday, I made reservations at Mesa Grill. Knowing that my father appreciates southwestern spices and flavors, I knew it was going to be an adventure for both of us. 8:15 PM reservations on Friday night (10-10-08) and we were seated immediately. Started with some Black Widow Mojitos and some shots of Patron Silver. The mood of the restaurant was definitely busy and loud (not overly loud...I was able to have a nice conversation with my father). I wouldn't recommend it for a &quot;romantic&quot; dinner between two people. I did love the vibrant southwestern colors that covered M.G.\n\nWe ordered up a Smoked Chicken / Black Bean Quesadilla for an appetizer. Cut in four equal slices, these little triangles of taste bud bursting goodness satisfied as well as brought mass excitement to what was coming in the main course. The flavors that popped from the chicken were amazing, very tasty!\n\nMy father got the Chipotle Halibut (which he raved about for days after the trip, stating &quot;The best meal I have ever had&quot;). I got the Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye with Green and Red Sauce, which was extremely tender and full of flavors of chills, garlic and grilled aged beef...well worth getting if you are a steak fan (ask for it medium rare!). \n\nAfter reading some of the reviews pre and post my visit to the Mesa Grill in Las Vegas, I have got to speak from the heart...and from the heart of someone who likes to enjoy a good meal...\n\n- If you can't hang with the high end cost...DON'T GO! I look at a meal like this as experiencing art and taking in everything as an experience as a whole. Food, at this caliber, shouldn't be consumed as a burger from In-N-Out or a Pizza from Round Table. It should be enjoyed bite by bite. Some people just don't understand how someone could drop a C-Note + for a meal...but then again, some people can't and don't understand the arts. \n\n- Small portions aren't necessarily a bad thing, especially if you take it bite by bite and enjoy what you are tasting. Buffets are all good when you are down to get stuffed for a good price. Here, you pay for high quality dishes that will be sure to stuff you if you take your time and enjoy it. \n\n- The dishes I tried definitely brought the heat! Amazing flavors that aren't afraid of leaving some sweat on the brow! (The Black Widow Mojito is really a refreshing beverage when eating some of the more spicier dishes). \n\n- While I heard about the poor service, the staff were on the ball (consider this was on a Friday night from 8:00 - 9: 30 PM). Very friendly and helpful. \n\n2 Black Widow Mojitos\n2 Shots Of Patron\n1 Smoked Chicken Quesadilla Appetizer\n1 Chipotle Halibut Entree\n1 Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye\n\nTotal W/ Tip : $180.00\n\nYeah, Bobby Flay has gained some respect from me and I'll be returning to his institution for sure!"

Then, an odd moment...we waited for like 15 minutes then the server came by with our check which had our app and food order on it but, we didn't get the food yet. We were both confused. Of course we told the server we didn't get our food yet and it came right out. I guess it was a communication issue. The entree's were great so I can't complain there. Nor sure if I'll go back because it was a little pricey and I've had better at more affordable restaurants."

The pork was my favorite entree but the bone-in ribeye was also a delicious choice.\n\nI could go on about all of the other entrees we sampled but the praise would get redundant.  \n\nThe only negative was the sommelier who had a terrible attitude and was not excited about pouring a bottle of wine under  $70.

If it wasn't for the fact that it is in the middle of Cesar's Palace, I would have guessed that it was just your average South-Western/Mexican restaurant.  It was when the hostess asked me to remove my hat when I realized that they take themselves pretty seriously here, and thanks to the food, rightfully so.\n\nMy meal was delicious! I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Sweet Corn Tamale as an appetizer, the New York Steak as my main entr\u00e9e, and mash potatoes as a side.  I actually had a difficult time selecting what I wanted, because although the menu is small, most of the items were unusual dishes that I wasn't interested in trying.  The menu consisted of a lot of seafood and less traditional meats, and I just wanted something basic.  Thankfully everything that I ordered turned out to be really good.  The highlight was the shrimp appetizer.  It was ridiculously priced for how tiny it was, but the combination of flavors was outstanding.  The theme of the meal in general was flavor, and everything from the bread to the pear margarita that I ordered pack a ton of it.  \n\nIn addition to my food, I tried my date's Pork Tenderloin.  It was amazing!  I would highly recommend it as a main dish, and it is most likely what I would order the next time I am here.\n\nMesa Grill is not a place that I could eat at all of the time, nor is it a place I would take someone to impress with ambiance.  However, they have superbly flavorful food that was well worth the visit.  It will not be one of my 'go-to' places when I visit the strip, but I can see myself coming back from time to time."

And even when I ate it in the restaurant, there was lots of fat.\n\nOne dining partner got the specialty grilled pork loin and proclaimed it fabulous.\n\nFor a side we got a group-split of two servings of the roasted corn, and that was terrific.\n\nMy cocktail was something with grapefruit juice. It was so refreshing (I totally love grapefruit.)."

Ribeye was sold out (couple hrs before they closed on a Monday night), so I got the NY strip steak.  The seasoning and the sear on the steak were just right, cooked to medium rare, and served with a circle comprised of 3 sauces.  One of the sauces had a little kick but lended a complexity to the flavor.  It was unlike any steak I've ever had before.  If you want a steak but possibly something different, I would highly recommend this place.  I could tasty salty and spicy among other things.\n\nNY strip steak = 5/5\nShrimp & corn tamale appetizer = 5/5 (big enough to share w/ a friend)\nRoasted corn side = 5/5 (couldn't begin to finish all of it, share a side w/ a friend)\nComplimentary bread and butter = 5/5 (several kinds of bread)\nShell-Off Lobster = 4/5 (I tried my friend's entree and didn't have my own, so this is based on 1 bite really)\nService = 5/5\n\nWith no microwave at my hotel, I made a point to finish the steak at the expense of leaving some of the other stuff behind."

We did not have a reservation(I recommend that you do).We arrived at 4:40pm, 20 minutes before their advertised opening time. After being told we could not get a table until 10:00 pm, they offered us a seat at the bar were we able to order from there. This is where our evening began to become exceptional.\n Our bartender/waiter Efren, outside of the food was to become our highlight of the evening. As always when dining at a new restaurant I rely heavily on our server for recommendations. Efren was perfect from our cocktail (margarita) to and including our dessert. His patience, warm personality and ability to find exactly what we would enjoy was \"spot on\".\n We started with a classic margarita where our servers inquisition of our tastes paid off. A little pricy but well worth it. (Fresh squeezed lime juice and a generous pour) \n First course from the appetizer menu:BARBECUED RIBS with Peanut Chipotle Sauce + Green Onion - Peanut Relish $15. SOUTHWESTERN SPICE CHICKEN SKEWERS Mint, Butter Lettuce, Cilantro + New Mexico Chile Sauce $15. Shared we both loved the flavours. My wife thought the ribs could have been a little more juicy. The chicken was served with small corn tortilla wraps to make some small soft taco from the chicken skewers.\nOur main course, again shared: GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS Blackberry - Cascabel Barbecue Sauce + Collard Greens with Smoked Chiles $44 and ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON\nSpicy Black Bean Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema $32 with sides\nRoasted Corn Chipotle Aioli, Lime +Cotija Cheese, Mashed Potatoes\n+ Green Chile Queso Sa.... perfection.\n Could it get any better? I was excited to try a Bobby Flay dessert. Known for his use of chocolate and spice I had to have the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Not really a pudding but more of a cake and not on the advertised Menu. Sweet, salty and oh so good.\n If you are like me and usually avoid reading lengthy reviews and skip to the last summation...Eat Here! Do not be afraid to sit the bar and tell Efren I sent you."

(Sure wished he was)\n\nAnyways, the pricey burger was not cooked to temp, I think due to error by the server even though he repeated back to us \"Medium Well\"...which somehow when it came out turned into medium rare...which was not even \"medium\"...it was like red-raw-dripping cold meat.  Total turn-off.  Not the kitchens fault if the server biffed the order...but \n\nOnce we sent it back and it came back out, it was cooked correctly, but honestly, still was not a burger to write home about.  Massively over seasoned with mostly salt from what I could tell.  Fries were also way over seasoned to the point where I really did not want finish them.\n\nSoooo, I have to think this was just a bad visit?  I am encouraged by the other reviews, but at least for me, the Mesa Grill was not memorable good, but rather memorable bad.  We had one other burger experience during our two-day trip to LV, and we kept comparing Holsteins at the Cosmopolitan to the Mesa Grill and it was like night and day."

That's the best word to describe it.\n\nMy wife,  however, had the cobb salad.  The was so salty,  it was inedible.  So, she sent it back.  Asked them \"light salt\".  So, what did they do?

My boyfriend and I stopped by for brunch and we were pleasantly surprised. They brought out a bread basket while we waited for our appetizer. The bread was delicious! There were tiny jalapeno biscuits, cornbread, blueberry cake and a raisin scone. Everything was perfect. The bread was warm and very fresh. I could seriously eat like 10 of those jalapeno biscuits!  \n\nWe ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido as our appetizer. So good! The cheese was topped with red and green peppers. They served it with some light and crispy blue corn chips. I'm already craving this again...\n\nFor my entree I ordered the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles. They were pretty good, but very different from the chilaquiles I'm used to eating. The tomatillo salsa was good, but my favorite part was the side of hominy grits. They were very flavorful!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. It was SO good! If you like sweet potatoes, you will love this dish. It was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. \n\nWe didn't save room for dessert, so we will have to go back one of these days to give that a try.

The glass windows were shades of yellow, red, blue, and green; the ceiling looked like the hull of a ship; the chairs were adorned with cow print. Apparently this was supposed to be a revolutionary interpretation of the restaurant's theme of southwest cuisine theme.\n To start, the bread was adventurous but not a favorite. Now that I remember it, the bread was a corn muffin with jalapeo and corn kernels in it. At first the muffin just tasted rather bland and stale; then the jalapeo aftertaste bitch slapped my throat and said \"fuck you\" on the way down.\n As an appetizer I had the server-recommended tiger shrimp and corn tamales with a cilantro-garlic sauce. Never having tasted tamale before, I had no idea what to expect. The cilantro-garlic sauce elevated the dish to a new level. The tamales were spicy and flavorful with bits of corn hidden inside, just for fun. The shrimp were cooked just right and didn't last long on the plate. Bob Ross would've called them \"our little secret\". Then, he would have threatened your life to make sure you would never tell anyone that secret.\n The entre was fine but not memorable - lamb tenderloin with a cilantro-mint sauce. The lamb was a bit overcooked and on its own not incredibly flavorful. What was impressive was how Southwest American and Mediterranean cuisines seemed to have wild sex on the plate. The mint took me for a ride to the best gyro-serving establishment I've never been to. The cilantro took role of the prison bitch to the powerful mint flavor. All in all, it was a very satisfying meal."

The fries were nicely seasoned and crispy.  Lots of places can pull that off.  While the pork sandwich was very tasty, I was still disappointed considering the establishment.

That being said, I can easily give the Mesa Grill a 4 star if they paid better attention to not overcooking the duck, making the pork sandwich a more decadent experience, or just dropping the price 5 bucks across the board.

Always was a winner.\n\nPros:\n- extremely efficient wait staff\n- tuna entree was excellent,5star\n- chilli rellenos was good, 4 star\n\nCons:\n- chopped salad was old lettuce and slightly wilted. Chopped tomatoes and canned kidney beans, canned chick peas and canned olives. The salad was dry and void of adequate dressing. After served by server our waiter saw it, and with a frown on forehead asked if we wanted more dressing before we could ask for it. The waiter did comp us the salad. Bobby Flay, \"Whats up for $17\"\n- White wine by the glass had 6 or 7 choices. I knew reisling but all other varietal choices were unrecognizable. Told wait person the wine choices were Greek to me. \"What was like a sauvignon blanc? The recommendation was not very good.\n\nWith all Vegas Strip food prices stratospheric, I think Mesa Grill is off our list. Tons of new options."

Not knowing when I'd have the opportunity again, I hiked all over Ceasar's Palace in my search for lunch.\n\nI like that they had a Prix Fixe lunch menu for those of us who want to tour around the menu and don't know where to start.  I loved my waitress Catherine, who while overstretched and busy, was attentive to a lone diner.  Without even having to ask, she searched out the pastry chef, realizing that there was a nut allergy, so that I could eat my lovely dessert.  I loved that they seated me at a table, instead of the bar, even with luggage in tow.\n\nFor the appetizer I had  the blue Corn Pancake, which is a very succulent BBQ'd duck in a blue corn pancake with a habanero chile sauce with a hint of anise.   For the Entree I had the Seared Sea scallops.  I wish I knew what it was, I think the searing and basting method made it taste a little off.  The sweetness of the scallops was missing. For dessert the chef's selection was a Banana's Foster ice cream with a hazelnut brittle.  YUM \n\nI would give Mesa 3.75 stars I think.  Things didn't come off as expected of a Celebrity Chef experience. The bread served with the meal was cold.  My waitress was stretched beyond the limit, meaning I had to wait a considerable amount of time before I could touch my ice cream.  (Deathly allergic to macadamias...I don't mess around).  The appetizer, not the entree, stole the show."

Waiters are attentive, tables and cleaned within seconds, and the staff knows the menu inside and out. Our waiter said he had been there for over 5 years - so, that's an amazing testament to how great it must feel to work there as well!\n\nWith that said, the food was everything I could ever hope for.\n\nPork Tenderloin: Great, hearty portions of tender pork. Cooked in bourbon, giving it a great flavor. Tasty ancho chile sauce on the pork. Accompanied by a sweet potato tamale with a pecan butter - amazing! Must try this. It's supposedly one of their signature dishes, so you really can't go wrong with this.\n\nGrilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: Smaller portion compared to the tenderloin, but still an amazingly well made dish. Serrano pepper sauce with a mint chimichurri. Comes with a blue corn tamale with basil butter. This complimented the dish really well, although I preferred the tamale that came with the pork tenderloin. \n\nSide of grilled asparagus that wasn't anything special, but complimented the dishes very well.\n\nGive this place a chance and make sure you have reservations beforehand. It's well worth a trip!"

However, I would recommend it to someone who was looking for tex-mex with signature flavors that tends to be on the spicy-tangy side.  Lunch was expensive but I think the prices are fair when compared to hotel cafes.\n\nP.S. they have a delicious chocolate tequila on their dessert menu!"

All of these dishes shared Bobby Flay's signature sensibilities...a bit of heat, a touch of sweetness, maybe a bit of tang, and a mixture of textures.

We were feeling brave so we had our waiter Kent surprise us with two margaritas, two appetizers, and two meals. As crazy as this may sound, Kent already won our trust over by introducing himself and having a conversation with us at the bar prior to the restaurant opening. \nI'm not going to attempt to describe the dishes we got because It would be a disservice to the chef, but they were all GREAT.\nThe appetizers Kent ordered for us were the tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale and the blue corn pancake. The tiger shrimp was the favorite of the two, but i feel that's more of a personal taste preference than anything because the Blu corn pancake was killer too!\nThe entrees consisted of the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and the grilled lamb porterhouse cops. Both were seasoned to perfection and complimented with the perfect sauces.\nIf you're looking for a nice dinner to compliment your Vegas experience you can't go wrong coming here. Ask for Kent and if you have an open mind and an empty stomach have him order for you  :)"

But a was a little worried that Mesa Grill could be one of those \"just marketing\" or \"just name\" kind of restaurants, as Bobby Flay owns this. That was not the case.\n\nMesa Grill delivers the goods. Located in Ceasar's Palace, it does look a little unassuming from the outside, but once you go inside, you get the full perspective, sections and layers of levels make the most of the somewhat limited space. I strongly suggest you make reservations first.\n\nThe service is quite good, with a very knowledgeable waiter, who knows the menu by heart and can guide you and help you make the right decision. \n\nWe started off with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, the rough cut Tuna Nachos, the Tiger Shrimp with the Roasted Corn Tamale, and a Crab Cake. They were all good, but the Tuna Nachos and the Tiger Shrimp were just superb.\n\nOur waiter told us that there are two dishes that made this restaurant famous, the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon. My friends ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak and I ordered the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. My dish has to be one of the top 10 dishes I've had, period. You would not believe this was pork if they didn't tell you, it was tender and juicy, cooked just right.\n\nWe ate so much that we couldn't finish our dishes even though we tried to.\n\nI must say, that this place is on the pricier side, but this is Vegas, and this was a memorable meal.\n\nMake Mesa Grill a stop on your next Vegas trip."

The plating was a little unexpected; this is not your typical tamale were the protein is cooked in the middle of the Maza.  The Maza is wrapped in a corn husk, steamed and sliced open.  The shrimp are prepared separately.  Everything is swimming in a yummy corn sauce. Not spicy at all.  Big enough to serve as a stand alone meal. Would definitely eat this again.\n\nHad the pork tenderloin for a main entree.  It was masterfully cooked.  I loved the combination of sauces - sweet with mild heat.

The restaurant was a mad house which was ok as we knew it was going to be lively and it's literally right in the middle of a casino. We took a seat in the bar and were immediately struck by how unkempt the actual bar was. There was a 2009 best cocktail recipe book stuck on one of the shelves and a bottle of jug wine sitting next to it. I asked for a glass of sparkling wine or champagne and was given a mini bottle that tasted so terrible I had to send it back and get a margarita (which was delicious). We were seated shortly thereafter and our waiter was great - really on top of things and enthusiastic about waiting on us. We ordered a few more drinks (S getting one that was bubblegum pink so he made me switch with him) but were saddened by how awful the wine list was. There were no California wines which would have matched up perfectly to the Tex Mex style of food at Mesa Grill nor were there any great wines to try - it was as if the wine list was a complete afterthought. We persevered and placed our order - to start we ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the Salmon and Tuna Tartars. The cheese and salmon were delicious but the tuna smelled really fishy so we sent it back. We were brought another scoop of salmon and all was made right in our worlds. For our main courses, I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and S had the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. My dish was inedible because the spice rub was too heavy and all you tasted was spice - not seasoning but spice. S was happy with his dish especially the Brussels sprouts he ordered as an additional side. Our waiter handled the situation perfectly and was awesome when I sent mine back so it wasn't a big deal. All in all, I had high expectations for Mesa Grill and they fell flat against what was delivered. It felt like Bobby Flay put his name on the restaurant and just left. I can't imagine that he'd be thrilled with the food that was leaving the kitchen and the atmosphere didn't feel like a celebrity chef was involved except for the conception of the idea and that where it stopped. The one bright spot were the Brussels sprouts - amazing and only a handful of ingredients (you can find the recipe in his Mesa Grill cook book)."

We ordered a nice bottle of wine but had to flag our server down to order, then to get bread, then to get our plates cleared, and then for the bill...and we were patiently waiting the whole time (i don't want my food spit in) Then the couple next to us decided to go through a divorce...I mean it.

From the ancho chile-honey glazed salmon to the smoked chicken black bean quesadilla to the Mesa burger and southwestern fries, every dish was a solid choice. \n\nGiven his grilling expertise, I felt compelled to get the Mesa burger. The whole thing was pretty much perfect. A juicy burger complemented by some onions and subtle cheddar cheese where the taste of the grill showed all the way through.

However, this place impressed me astronomically. The appetizer we got (the warm goat cheese spread with corn chips) and the bread basket with all baked assortments was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the lamb chops and the veal, amazing. The sauce and aioli just make everything on all of Bobby Flays' dishes, and you can tell when you're eating, that he put a lot of his effort into what's on your plate in front of you. The veal was a 16oz veal, which we didn't even know you could get that big..and once again, amazing.\nI believe each plate comes with a special tamale as the side dish, each one is different though. Although I'm not a big tamale fan, my boyfriend chowed his right down (so it must have been that good).\nOverall, I was definitely impressed by the portions, much bigger than expected (we were most definitely full leaving dinner). Not as expensive as I would have guessed either, good surprise. Also, I believe the menu does change from time-to-time (as all big name chef restaurants do often) but not too often that you'd be upset that you couldn't get what you got last year. I was very satisfied with every aspect of the restaurant and our waiter was also very helpful, he explained all of our questions we had on the menu.\nWe will definitely be putting Mesa Grill on our \"must go\" list every time we come back into the city."

Would eat here again in a heartbeat, I can honestly say I haven't dined at such an expensive place, but don't regret it for one second.  The flavors suck you in and let you navigate and explore food flavors like you haven't before."

            "review": "I haven't tried their dinner menu.  The 2-star rating is only for their lunch menu.  In summary, this has NOT met my expectation of how Tex-Mex should taste like.  I had much much better Tex-Mex food at San Antonio (Rosario's, for example).  I wouldn't not take another lunch at this place.\n\nI ordered the aged tenderloin tortillas (~$24).  Thin sliced, and yes, the tenderloin was aged, great quality meat, nicely cooked to the way I want BUT the size was like... 4oz only?  The beef slices were occupying less than 1/4 the size of the dish and the rest was covered by chopped and diced mango, avocado, pickles, etc, and 4 tortillas each folded twice in a quarter circle.  Other than the tenderloin, the rest is about what you can get at Acalpulco or other local Mexican restaurants at half or cheaper price.  This make it an overpriced dish.\n\nThe BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad is good though.  Pretty strong lamb aroma and flavor from the meat and the goat cheese.  But other than that, I don't see how \"Tex-Mex\" this dish is.\n\nThe spicy chicken + sweet potato hash.... Nice sweetness as an appertizer dish but too sweet as an entree.  \n\nWe liked the spiced pork tenderloin burger.\n\nServed after seated, the muffins, corn bread, and the bite-size jalapeno biscuit were good, especially the jalapeno biscuits.   Finally there was something new and tasted good.\n\nAgain, this place does not live up to be a good \"Tex-Mex\" restaurant.  I would rather visit Texas again (if I found cheap flight deals) for real good Tex-Mex food."

Wow, that was an amazing dish.  I usually shy away from cioppino because I'm not that big on tomato broth.  Green chile sauce makes it more than worthwhile.  My wife had a grilled chicken that had mango salsa and 12 spices (that's one more than you get at KFC).  Dessert was another great creation.  We split an order of the churros that came with a chocolate sauce that was flavored with star anise.  The waiter recommended it.  It often pays to listen to what dishes they recommend.\n\nAnother standout dish I had on a past visit was the pork tenderloin.  Absolutely amazing chile sauces with that one, also.  The strawberry shortcake that time was good, but not nearly as good as the churros.\n\nAlso, I have to give kudos to the service.  The staff was more than friendly throughout the evening.\n\nThis restaurant is a must, whether in Vegas or New York (though Vegas is much easier to get into than NYC)."

And so we did. Now my parents aren't really big fan of American style restaurants like these and I think that this place didn't change their minds about it. \n\nFirst of all the service was okay...our waitress seem a little preoccupied or rather annoyed with us taking our time.....so I didn't feel like her service was all that great but it wasn't all that terrible either....I would like to think that she probably just had a long day and was really tired.....so I will let that go. \n\nBoth my parents ordered the Pumpkin Soup and I didn't like pumpkin but that was the only soup they were serving so I didn't get a starter. My bf tried their Blue Corn Pancake with bbq duck....it was really meant for one serving...actually after seeing that I realized all the appetizers were made for one serving....bf said it the duck meat was overloaded with Hoisin sauce so it was pretty sweet. I didn't know that the appetizers were going to be so small because I didn't really want to eat that much so I ordered the Blue Corn Lobster Taco as an entree....turns out it was three bite sized tacos....it was good but for the price it was just not worth it.\n\nI ordered the Veal chop for my mom and the Green Chile  Cioppino for my dad. I guess he really didn't like the flavor because he only ate the one jumbo prawn and the scallops but not the Bass, Clams or the Mussels. He said the fish had a weird texture and the flavor was weird. My mom liked the veal chop...I tried a piece of it and it was indeed very tender and flavorful. We had a side dish of spinach - $9 dollars for a small bowl even though it was meant to be shared.....ehhh not worth it. My bf apparent enjoyed his Mango Spiced Rubbed Tuna Steak....it did look pretty good and I tried a piece of that too and I guess it was pretty good. \n\nThe bill came out to be around 250ish plus tip....I was expecting a three digit bill however I didn't expect it to be in the 200's.....the quality and quantity of the food was just not worth that amount of money and I don't really think I would come back. I wasn't really satisfied with the food or service and quite frankly I left still hungry.

The decor is cute, a little outdoorsy and casual. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. He let us know which were more popular and wasn't afraid to tell us which items he didn't like either. Usually, servers just try to sell everything to you so I like that he was honest with us. Overall, the service was great. They always kept our glasses full and we never had to search for them because they just always happened to be there when we needed them haha\n\nWe decided to use their fixed menu and chose items off that list. For appetizers we ordered something Blue Pancake and Salmon & Tuna tartar. Personally, I liked the tar tar better than the pancake but my bf loved the pancake more than the tartar. The tartar itself is great but the chips that come with it are someewhat of a fail lol. For entrees we ordered sea scallops and their salmon entree. Both were DELICIOUS. The salmon was cooked realllllly well and the scallops came with avacado, chips, etc. Basically, both were the highlights of the meal, hands down. Lastly, we shared the Vanilla Profiteroles for dessert. I don't know what profiteroles are but it basically looks like a fancy icecream-filled puff to me. Haha either way, it was pretty good and a nice way to finish the meal. I think our meal cost an upward of $80, pretty pricey for lunch but I still thought it was pretty damn good. The Michelin star is well-deserved."

I ordered scallops for my main course and they were too salty for me.  There were 4 jumbo scallops on the plate but I could only eat 3 because of the saltiness.

The tamale was grainy and falling apart and not sweet enough. My husband had the chicken which he thought was amazing, and it was topped with mango chunks which is pretty yummy stuff. My mother in law had the salmon which she found lack luster and also found a bone in it (weird). I'm from Chicago and have had the pleasure at eating at some of Rick Bayless restaurants, and I hate to compare,  but let's just say this was definitely no where near what I was hoping for.

I think we asked for atleast 3 of these among 2 girls. so f'n good. they even had this awesome jalapeno relish jam ditty to spread on it that was just heavenly. for sides, the grits are just amazing. again, savory and just really really nice. it was my first experience with grits and I was in love.\n\nwhen I found out there was also one in vegas, I was all over that like a hobo on ham sammich. next vegas trip, I was there for brunch. the spicy chicken sweet potato hash was JUST as good. think of an eggs benedict to the nth power. god, Im getting antsy just thinking about it! the bread basket was just as tasty but they didnt have the jam. oh well. went back ANOTHER time a few months later with a group of 20. raved about the spicy chicken sweet potato hash. about 18 people ordered it and there were smiles all around. this should have stopped here...\n\nok so the mistake....\n\nCOMING FOR DINNER. bleh. friends wanted to check out this place for dinner on the last vegas trip and I must admit after reading the reviews was a bit wary. so here's the lowdown. he has a few amazing standout dishes but everything else is just MEDIOCRE and dull.\n\ncactus pear martini- strong as hell. it was good. not o-m-g but it was good.\n\nblack widow mojito- tasty\n\nfresca- this messican koolaid was not too shabby either. definitely stronger than ur average koolaid though =P\n\nbread basket- just so so, not as good as the brunch one but the jalapeno white bread was very tasty. the corn jalapeno muffin thing just crumbles and is a bit dry and tasteless.\n\nappetizers:\n- mushroom grits with poached egg- ORGASMIC. I swear I would have licked the plate if I could. instead I used the bread to mop it up.\n\n- ceviche sampler- CRAP crap crap.\n\nentrees:\n\n- veal chop- average at best. sauce was meh. it was really just so so. the wild rice tamale that came with it was okay. \n\n- 16 spice duck breast- i HEART duck. the sauce was delicious, they cooked it a good rare plus the way I asked. it was nice but a little tougher than how I like my duck. I would give this dish 3.5-4 stars. the goat cheese chorizo tamale that came with this was just aiiiiiiite.  I liked the duck more than my friend who picked the restaurant initially. she literally just left half of the dish. after the meal, she said she utterly disappointed and PISSED. eep.\n\nthe food was meh at best (except the grits). other than the ceviche nothing was really BAD BAD but c'mon for the money and bobby's big ass mouth and cockiness, STEP IT UP!!!! (yeah I said it)\n\n\nfinal thoughts:\n\n- stick to brunch. order the spicy chicken sweet potato hash with grits. get on that bread basket as many times as u can!\n\n-  if u ever see grits or any type of poached egg on the menu, GET ON THAT!!!\n\n- bobbly flay is still a cocky ass bastard and although has a few really good dishes, needs to work on the consistency of ALL his dishes. throw down NUTTIN....seriously"

I know he didn't cook my food but everything was very good. The cactus fruit margarita was AMAZING! My friend and I shared the special prawn appetizer that night and I sopped up the sauce with bread it was fantastic!  I had the chili rubbed rib eye, I enjoyed the 22oz three times;  once at restaurant and twice at home. Great doggy bag! My friend had the rellano, I tasted a bite it was very flavorful.  For dessert my friend had the coconut cake, it had a great mouth feel and the coconut flavor was not strong. I had the blueberry lemon tart with blueberry marshmallow ice cream. It was good. The tart shell was too hard which decreased the enjoyment. The service was good. If I could have I would given a 4.5, but you can't so I went in the fair direction.  I just may return ;-)"

We were looking forward to try out their burgers because we heard a lot of positive comments on it but it turns out the burgers were on the lunch menu and not their dinner menu therefore we were a little bummed out. Their menu is limited, did not offer much selections. Their portions were really small for its price but was still tasty. They have side dish options but cost $10. The side dishes do not come with the entree they our separate. This is why the price is too high for what it delivers. On a positive note, they did have good bread served before our main dishes arrived and  their service is great. Our server was very informative what the day specials are and if there were any changes to the menu. They have very clean bathrooms, and also display multiple Bobby Flay magazine covers which is interesting to look at when you're waiting for someone to finish up in the bathroom."

            "review": "Was very excited to try this restaurant out. Like some of other reviewers, am a Bobby Flay fan. There were 4 of us in our party - 2 adults & 2 kids under age of 10.\n\nMenu varies for lunch & dinner. We chose to go for an early dinner - around 5-ish. We were seated right away in the back part of resturant in a round table. Was a nice \"view\" of the resturant, cooking stations, and other tables. Perhaps a little less noisy than the rest of the place. We were able to talk amongst ourselves just fine. (Even share a bit of conversation wtih members of the table right next to us.)\n\nAdults had the Tuna steak. (I really enjoyed it medium-rare. My husband had it med-well.) The poblano-peppercorn sauce was tasty and married well with the couscus. Our portions were a good size, I thought. We also had an order of the lobster tacos - good flavor. I agree wth Cat P. that the asiago cheese jalapeno bread was the best of all the breads in the bread basket ;-) \n\nWe initially were going to order a couple apps for the kids - but our waiter suggested a burger or cheese burger for them. (Nice touch! And worth the $12 for a grade-A burger w/ fries.)  They enjoyed refillable sodas/lemonaide. While the adults drank tasty margaritas - go ahead, try the signature White peach Margarita!  \n\nDesert... ah, the finishing touch on a great meal. We shared 2 deserts: toasted coconut cake and banana cream pie. Not too sweet and hit the spot. \n\nService notes: Our waitstaff was attentive, knowledgable about the menu, and were delightful with the two kids.\n\nWhat we might do differently next time: Say no to the mineral water ($8.50 per bottle was a bit too spendy.)\n\nIt was a good meal that came with a price. It could be considered your \"big spend\" item while visiting. We would consider coming back (just with Adults). \n\nSave a Margarita for me.....!"

Sadly, Bobby was not there, and to my chagrin our server said we just missed him; he was there the week before. Ah well. \n\nThe restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all the waitstaff were very professional and friendly. They have several lounge \"cubicles\" to wait while your table is being setup too, which I thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait. \n\nWe ate:\n3 course meal of: \n1) Blue corn pancake: bbq duck + habanero chile + star anise sauce - Pretty good, but a little on the salty side\n2) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: pretty good, light and fresh, came with Mexican spiced fries too that were really good. This is what everyone calls the #1 dish here, but I really think that award goes to the corn tamale (below). \n3) Panna Cotta: SO GOOD - nice and light and the fruit was soaked in some type of liquor and really fresh and ripe. \n\n\nOthers:\nAppetizers: \nCremini Mushroom Quesadilla: pretty good, but will try something else next time\nTiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: OMG I could eat this all day, every day, for the rest of my life. The shrimp was nicely seasoned and tender, not overcooked, the tamale was sweet and savory, the white corn was fresh and drowned in this yummy creamy corn sauce. YUM....\n\nFriend got the Chile Rellenos, which was also quite good. Melt in your mouth cheesy-ness. Mmm\n\nGet the corn tamale!!"

            "review": "We've been dining at Mesa Grill since it first opened over 10 years ago. And I'm happy to say that it's just as good every time we go. The only thing that I think this restaurant is missing is some updated dishes. I think after 13 years it's nice to see some new options on the menu. \n\nThe best items are on the menu are the appetizers and  think the entr\u00e9es could do with a bit of an update. I was happy to see that the restaurant was busy, because on my last couple visits it was on the slower side. The major downfall of this restaurant is that the servers, managers hostesses and others don't seem like they enjoy working there. \nOne of the best things about going out to eat is creating an environment that makes people want to come back. I enjoy servers who aren't too intrusive but yet fun to be around. I also felt like the greeting at the front desk left a lot to be desired, her main concern was that everybody in the party was present rather than greeting us and welcoming us to the restaurant. It really sets the tone for the evening the way you were greeted at the door. I kind of felt like I walked into Denny's. No offense to Denny's. \n\nWhen we sat down we waited quite a while to be greeted and after our drinks were ordered it took quite a while for the bread basket to be delivered. I just felt like it was difficult to get anybody's attention and that there was a pervasive feeling of apathy throughout the entire staff. Sometimes when a restaurant stays open for a long time people get complacent and forget that you're being welcomed into a new environment and you're paying a lot of money. It's around $100 per person in this restaurant that's definitely not a cheap evening. And I expect everybody around me to be on their toes with a smile on their face, ready to  fulfill any requests. I was wearing a black velvet dress and asked for a black napkin since they were only white ones on the table. I had to ask three times and noticed that there were several black napkins sitting at a busing station nearby. \n\nI also was disappointed with the signature cocktail which was a pomegranate martini. I think Bobby Flay has a great flair for cocktails and unfortunately this cocktail did not represent anything that I think he would be proud of. It just tasted like a glass full of vodka there was no flavor there was no subtlety it was just all alcohol.\n\nMany people in our party ordered the steak and everybody felt the steaks were top quality and very delicious. But at the end of the day it's just a steak I think it would be nice if they updated the side or did something a little bit more creative that reflected Bobby's complex flair for seasoning and ingredients. There's really no Southwest influence in any of the main dishes. So I'm not really sure why the menu was developed with the appetizers representing the theme of the restaurant where the entr\u00e9es are definitely standard fare. You could have a twice baked potato and pesto mashed potatoes anywhere with the steak. In fact you could probably make it at home pretty easily. I had the salmon with a honey glaze it was perfectly done and delicious but as somebody who dined out very frequently it really was not a memorable dish in anyway.\nI always come back to this restaurant whenever we visit Vegas a couple times a year, but I think it needs to be reinvigorated both in the service department and a little freshening up with a menu."

I am not at all a fan of Las Vegas, so if a restaurant can earn five stars, it certainly stands out amongst the smoke filled recirculated air and endless casino noise!  Very comfortable, colorful ambiance; the private dining room is a great spot for groups.\n\nHad the great opportunity to diner here during a recent business trip.  As we were a larger sized party, we had a limited selection menu.  Note -- and still, Bobby get his five stars!  The roasted garlic corn tamale (sans roasted shrimp for this non-crustacean gal) was delightful -- his recipes take very simple plates and create amazing layers of flavor.  The corn cilantro sauce was great, and altogether, the dish had a surprising kick hidden within -- fantastic!  The grilled Mahi Mahi was cooked perfectly - left very tender, with a roasted pineapple/chili sauce and a pineapple salsa -- the combo of sweet, warm, and spicy!  (Mr. Flay certainly knows exactly how to use chiles and while he likely even includes chile with desserts, it works!  Service was excellent. Wine list was plentiful and had great options to accompany spicy foods!\n\nOh - and I LOVE the dining chairs in the main room -- wood frame with a red leather seat, backed with a cowhide insert on the back side of the chair. If anyone knows where I might find something similar, drop me a note!  Any San Francisco Mesa grills on the way??!"

We had to get a reservation more than 24 hours in advance, and the place was packed when we arrived.\n\nWhile waiting for our table, I used the restroom. There was a little bit of \"number two\" on the toilet and on the wall! When I told the guy at the front desk he immediately called someone to have it taken care of. So that was impressive.\n\nWe sat and waited in a comfortable and contemporary couch. We were called almost exactly at our reservation time.\n\nAt our dining table, we were served bread which was unique and delicious. The corn meal muffin was slightly dry and very crumbly. We ordered a second basket of bread.\n\nEntrees range from $32 to $50. Steaks are on the high end. We ordered Salmon and Duck. We did not have appetizers and we did not order drinks.\n\nBoth of our entrees were absolutely outstanding. The salmon was not farm. It was fresh, moist, fatty, and perfect. The duck was glazed, medium rare, and great\n\nFor dessert, we split a coconut crusted piece of cake. It was very light, and very sweet. Really good. \n\nWe left the restaurant stuffed and satisfied with great food. Total came to $85. I left $75 in vouchers, $10 cash, and another $15 tip. So $100 total for two dinners and one dessert. That's a little on the high side for me. I imagine the price would double if we'd had an appetizer, a couple of drinks and one extra dessert.\n\nOnly down side was the service. It wasn't bad, BUT for these prices you expect better and faster service. They should fill your water almost as soon as you are at 50%. They should pull out your wife's chair, and give you or napkin. They should take your empty plate faster, and take your empty bread basket faster. Just better attention would help a lot.\n\nOverall, great experience, with opportunities in the waiter area."

I don't know whether the sauce was supposed to be for the fries or for the burger, but I used it on both and they both were delicious. \nWould come here again if I won jackpot at a casino or something.

Also tried the peach marg and it was good too.   \n\nApps:  definitely get the queso fundido and for a bigger group, the smoked chicken quesadillas were excellent. The names of the items sounded regular but the quality of the food and ingredients made it very special. The quesadilla had toasted sliced garlic and also avocado that was really good. The romaine salad was dressed with the perfect amount of dressing and the Parmesan crisp was really cool. \n\nWe all got different entrees and I got to try a bit from everyone's dish.  My favorite was the salmon dish. It was cooked perfectly and the ancho-chili honey glaze formed a slight crispiness that was also sweet and savory.  It was perfect!  The new york strip was large and also cooked perfectly.  Another unique dish was the halibut. It was crusted in blue corn which gave a slight crunchiness to the outside and the sauce it was sitting on had capers and olives among other goodness that was delicious.  The pork tenderloin was also delicious and the burbon and chili sauces were great to dip in. \n\nSide dishes are quite pricey. For 10 bucks a side, we got mashed potatoes, corn, and spinach.  My favorite of the three is the corn.  It was prepared with sauces that complimented the corn perfectly. \n\nFor dessert we split a deep dish banana pie which was amazing.  If you like banana pudding, you cannot go wrong with this dish. \n\n\nOverall, the quality of the service and food was outstanding.

We still had to wait about 10 minutes but that is not out of the ordinary on a Saturday in Vegas. \n\nThe decor of the place is...unique. It's like some kind of post-modern-meets-old-southwest looks with colorful window tiles and earthy toned walls. Odd but cool. Anyways, the food was simply amazing. I can't remember anything I ate except for the Coffee Rubbed New York steak. That's because nothing else really mattered. It was a unique experience for steak and it was simply amazing. The sides that it came with were also amazing...wasabi mashed potatos and aspragus I believe. I loved it.\n\nThe one complain was with the service...it took our waiter about 40 minutes to bring us our check at the end of the night..which was enough to ruin it for most of group (I was still happy with the steak). Looking at other reviews, maybe this was a one-time blunder or a rare occurance, but I can only speak to what I saw.\n\nRegardless...good center-Strip location the Caesar's...good decor...and awesome Bobby Flay food!"

My last visit to Vegas I ended up only at the bar as I forgot to make reservations so my boyfriend and I just came for mojitos. Yes, just mojitos. And you know what, they're worth the $14 a piece for them.\n\nSo over the years this place has progressively increased their prices which sucks, but the quality of food has always been top-notch. Plus, it's rare that I have good Tex-Mex cuisine. What I get is always California washed out Mexican food. This is a fantastic change while keeping the integrity of so many familiar ingredients.\n\nMy favorite appetizers are a tie between the goat cheese queso fondidu and the the blue corn pancake with BBQed duck. Now, many years ago the queso fondidu used to be melted goat cheese with a poblano salsa which I actually preferred over the rajas they serve with it now. That's just my personal preference though, but I still really like it a lot. With the blue corn pancake I've had inconsistencies with the amount of duck, and how they've plated it. Mixed in --- or sliced on top --- I'm assuming maybe it was just the quality of the duck, or from where they got the meat from. Breasts slice nicely, so that goes on top. Thigh not so much, so that get mixed in? Ok. Still good. I love duck in any way, so no complaints on my end taste-wise.\n\nFrom the most current menu, I'd have to say the pan roasted venison is my favorite and a close second would be the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloi. I've never ordered the 16 spice chicken however I've had it a couple of times over the years from picking off of other people's plates and the chicken has always been consistently good and never dry. \n\nThere used to be a spiced steak on the menu a long time ago and I wish they'd bring that back. :( The last two times I haven't ordered a steak so I don't know if any of the new steaks even compare. The ribeye looked fantastic, maybe next time I will order that. \n\nI'm sure next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back again, like I always am, even if it's just for a mojito. I love Mesa Grill."

My girlfriend had the salmon, which was cooked absolutely perfectly and seasoned amazingly. It was stunning. \n\nI had the Mesa burger, which is easily the best burger I have ever had in my life. Cooked medium, it was amazingly perfect. Seasoning, bun, the sear; I still think about it often. I wanted to hug the guy on the grill. \n\nOn top of that, great beer selection, and the service was really magnificent. Pretty reasonably priced too. (Lunch for 2 with appetizer and drinks was about $60). Well done guys, well done."

Our group shared an assortment of appetizers and loved every one.  Spicy!  My fave was the tuna nachos.  Prickly pear margaritas, yes please.  Ask for an extra order of bread, you got it - served with soft butter, I might add.  Who knew dinner also came with a show?  Our server was a spritely Eastern European who gave us the inside scoop on all the celebrity diners (Girls Next Door, super nice, Simpson sisters, bitches) as well as a fascinating and slightly inappropriate monologue on the price of beauty in Vegas.  Anyhow, I digress.  Dinner was delicious, service was great, and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."

After all we were seated for a 10 pm dinner, James, the server, if you don't want serve people than don't work the dinner shift.  When he came over to take our orders, he didn't even bother to find out what we wanted to drink, he just took our entree orders.  When our food came out it was alright.

Food, service, ambiance were all excellent.\n\nWe were seated as soon as we arrived, a little early, for our 7 PM reservation.  We were immediately greeted by water service, and our waiter offering me their Marguerita menu - oh my.  An enormous list of tequilas and several margueritas.  I was attracted to the peach and ordered that - it was SOOOO yummy!!\n\nWe ordered the Shrimp & Corn Tamale appetizer.  It was very good.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the dish was very tasty.\n\nHubster ordered the Chili Relleno - and the moans from across the table told me that it was very, very good.  It was definitely not your traditional Chili Relleno.  The exterior was crispy, there wasn't a tomato sauce over everything, but there were a couple of colorful sauces on the plate to run your bite through.  The stuffing was eggplant and mechanga cheese - again not a traditional stuffing.  But it was reported to be very, very good.\n\nI wanted something light for dinner, so ordered the Chicken Skewers appetizer.  This came with little tortillas, so you could make little tacos if you wanted, and a peanut sauce.  The chicken was nice and spicy, but not painfully so.  It was a small portion of 3 skewers, which was exactly what I wanted.\n\nI loved the ambiance.  It's a nice warm room, with warm southwest colors and a copper hood over the kitchen.  The kitchen was behind glass, and you could see the chefs at work, which I love.  We had seen a show on the Food Channel about the development of this restaurant, so it was really fun to see it in person.  \n\nI would definitely eat here again, there were several things on the menu that I would like to try."

Best part was since she was newly pregnant, I got the chance to eat what was left on her plate, yes, even after eating my entire meal! We finished off with dessert which I believe was a flourless chocolate cake. Decadent!!! And I must add that the service was extraordinary. Another friend was trying to mess with the waiter by asking him to bring him bottles of beer that had a SPECIFIC date stamped on them and the server happily accomodated his insane requests!

It was the first time we were at a Bobby Flay restaurant and were looking forward to a good meal.\n\nThe restaurant was modernly decorated. The noise level was high because of all the people, but it was still possible to have a conversation without raising my voice. It was really cool atmosphere. You could see into the kitchen right at the chefs doing the grilling too.\n\nThe bartender took good care of us and knew the food menu really well. I was joking with my buddy about getting a Flay cookbook and the bartender said \"Bobby will sign it for you. He's here in the kitchen. He was out here earlier.\" I walked over to take a look through the kitchen but didn't see him. I tried later too but no luck.\n\nWe started with a chicken quesadilla appetizer. Sounds pretty standard, but with the first bite the flavors just explode in your mouth. Goodness gracious I was not expecting that at all! The guac on the top was so fresh and had a hint of lime in it. There was an orangish sauce on it that had a nice kick and the chicken was grilled perfectly.\n\nOur entree was a the pork tenderloin with a goat cheese tamale. The dish itself was presented artfully and with care. The pork was cooked medium and had a slightly pink center. The outside crust was a pleasant brown with drips of the orange sauce on the 3 pieces. Taking a first bite of the pork was heavenly. The rub on the outside had crusted up just right while the inside was tender. The barbeque sauce on the plate was a little sweet and a little tangy, but paired well with the spic, orange sauce. It was truly and enjoyable dish.\n\nThe only problem was that we were too full for dessert. And it would've been cool to see or meet Bobby in person.\n\nThe staff was excellent, friendly, un-pretentious. Worth the money and I'd go again."

Instead of letting it drop, he came back with an open bottle of chardonnay and not only let her have it by the glass, but gave her the last glass complimentary.

Great mixture of cheeses.  There were not enough of the blue corn chips though.  Come on Bobby... for another penny or two throw a few more of those on the plate!  For lunch, the pork tenderloin sandwich was very good.  The panini style sandwich was crispy, and the spices were perfect and the pork was tender.  The only real downside was the size... not too much filling the sandwich.  The southwestern fries that came with it were not very good at all... more points off.  Some were soggy and/or oily, and the seasoning was just meh.  Points could have been added if a good dipping sauce came with it.  I stole my buddies horseradish mustard to use.\n\nService was very good overall with a few flaws.  We did not get the basket of bread until half way through our meal, and they were a bit slow on the response when we needed something.  Otherwise our waiter did a good job and was attentive.\n\nThe major points off here are for the price.  It simply was not worth the money.  For 2 burgers, 1 pork sandwich, 1 app and regular drinks... the bill was very close to $100 with tax and tip.  My good was decent with flaws, and the burger was nothing special either (although good).  Do yourself a favor...if you want selection and a decent cost, try somewhere else."

But I semi-refused to conclude that it was all that before I saw it with my two eyes.\n\nWe walked in a little bit after the normal lunch time (totally the way to go if you want to get some decent service at this busy and exposed venue at Caesars) - chilled with some margarita and a basket full of tasty breads (including the jalapeno mini biscuits which are my absolutely favorite).  The margarita was very satisfying - tangy, not to sweet, and just the right zing.  \n\nMy friends ordered the southwestern burger and the home fries as well as the filet of salmon with the sweet potato cakes.  I ordered the scrambled eggs prepared southwestern style with the fried tortillas, cheese, and the salsa embedded underneath the eggs (oh heavens...).  I'd have to say that all three were equally tasty and cooked just right.  None of the dishes were greasy, salty, or clashing with each other.  It was southwestern at its best.  I was fearing that it'd be just a fancy version on typical mexican dishes...but their interpretations of the classic southwestern dishes were quite impressive...based on the taste of each of the dishes.\n\nToo bad we were too full to taste the mexican donuts (i reckon we could have really done it if we wanted to)...but we wanted to empty our stomachs for the wine and dine at bouchon that night so we held our own at that moment.  \n\nOverall a very pleasant experience, I'd definitely come back here to eat and also spread the word that it's NOT an overrated restaurant with the face of a celebrity chef nowhere to be seen."

We had a total group of 4 dining.  Other entrees included the grouper, pulled pork sandwich, and bacon quesadilla.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  A number of us also enjoyed their amazing and spicy Bloody Mary's!  I've eaten here a number of times.  Every time, I really have enjoyed my meals!  The flavors are so vibrant and interesting.  Things can be spicy, so if you like that...you'll love Mesa Grill!    Basically the food & drinks are delicious!\n\nService:   Mike P was our server, and he did a fine job.  \n\nHints/Final thoughts:   The food here is really super tasty!  However, the only real complaint is that a lot of the dishes are not changeable.  Given many marinades, sauces, and preparation...apparently, they can't make many substitutions.  For my wife, who can't eat cilantro, this made ordering a little difficult.  They will try, but sometimes there can't be much done."

            "review": "I have noticed that Bobby Flay is one of those chefs that people really like or really hate.  His television persona exudes a bit of social akwardness that at times comes off as arrogance.  It is undeniable that his New Mexico flavor profile brings a dimension to food that is beyond good cuts of meat that can be a dime a dozen here in LV.\n\nThe duck tacos as recommended by our server were excellent.  The smoky taste of the duck was well balanced with the sweetness of a hoisin style sauce, and then further complemented with a bit of heat.  That is the one thing I have noticed about food here at Mesa Grill.  They add heat without burning your senses but yet retaining the flavor profile of the chile peppers.  Tuna nachos were also very good.\n\nThe bone-in ribeye was excellent with a nice spice rub.  I prefer ribeyes when it comes to grilling because it provides a better taste when the fat gets slightly burned. A bit kinky, but delicious.  The side dishes went a bit unnoticed except for the corn with green chiles and cotija cheese.  Eating this reminded of the fair food where you get the corn on the cob and you can pile on the toppings.  Having a tequila menu was an added bonus."

            "review": "I really liked Mesa Grill.  Yes, I went here because of Bobby Flay.  No, I don't think he's pretentious (but maybe he is, I've never met him :P).\n\nThey first brought out some breads -- blueberry spice muffin of some sort, jalapeno corn bread, fruit scone, coffee cake.  I was surprised that it wasn't just regular bread and butter but I liked it more!  Jalapeno corn bread was a bit bland though so it could use a little something.  The blueberry spice muffin thing was a bit strange.  The coffee cake was pretty good!\n\nTo drink, I got the cactus pear iced tea.  The waiter wasn't hesitant to recommend this one, and I'm really glad I got it.  Tastes mainly just like iced tea but has a subtler sweetness from the pear, though I have to admit I didn't taste the \"cactus.\"  They also brought out liquid sugar and knowing how much I love sugary iced tea, this was ideal!  Free refills too :).\n\nNext, I got the pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern mesquite fries.  The pork wasn't pulled pork (don't know why I expected that), but it was juicy and tender (not dry at all) and had a good kick of a spice to it!  Bread was grilled panini-style and the sandwich was really good!  The fries were well-seasoned but still needed ketchup.\n\nEnded with a chocolate corn bread pudding and it tasted pretty good, good amount of spongey-ness to the corn bread pudding and was drenched in some chocolatey sauce, though I have to say I think I tasted a bit of cheesiness to the sauces (like a cheesecake thing) and I didn't like that too much since I don't like cheesecake, but maybe that was just me.\n\nI didn't finish most of my fries and didn't finish half my sandwich and had to force myself to eat the dessert and I was sooo full.  It's pretty pricey for a sandwich and fries ($16) and dessert ($11) but I'm really glad I went.  Definitely more affordable for brunch than dinner."

I look for and find all these places they operate/own/are affiliated with and dont stop bugging till my bf takes me. \n\nMesa Grill was close to the top of that list and finally this year we went. Reservations are very necessary for dinner. It gets packed. Prices are well a little ridonkulous but expected. Their margaritas are strong and good not overpowering and pink! (well some are anyway, at least the one I got was) \n\nWe gorged on the bread basket, blue corn jalapeno something and raisin bread and just a bunch of yummy stuff. Well here comes the four stars...it's just my personal taste...I love Bobby, I thought the food was good but the entree selection (like at most of these celebrity chef places) was limited and typically that's fine but I guess none of the proteins stood out terribly and I really wasnt in the mood to pay over 30 bucks for bbq chicken. I'm not a fan of bbq, some other sauce maybe? more poultry selections and less selections of steak by the ounce would have been nice. You can have great steak anywhere I wanted signature stuff. \n\nWell as I mentioned earlier we piggies made the mistake of eating all the bread and when we saw the entrees were limited to like 6 choices other than the 3 sizes of steak we decided to order two apps each and try a bunch of different things. We asked the waiter a whole bunch of questions and let him steer us in the right direction. We ended up getting the two different quesadillas (chicken and black bean and the wild mushroom one) but we both got our own tiger shrimp and garlic tamale. We weren't in the sharing mood. \n\nBig mistake! It was soooo much food! Four appetizers for two ppl and two drinks was more than enough food, plus the bread basket...we couldnt even consider dessert (which makes me sad :( i love dessert but i was about to explode). \n\nThe quesadillas weren't huge but they were a good portion I couldnt finish a whole mushroom one b/c it was very rich (cheesy) but sooo freaking good with the mix of cheeses fontina  I think and cotija and this basil/cilantro green chili concoction over the whole thing AND AND a big ass fried egg with a slightly runny yolk that tied the whole thing together. Wow.  Amazing.  My bf's chicken one was really good too but very different less rich and had a great chipotle chili sauce (very mild). I couldnt decide which I liked better though I think you could get through more of the chicken/black bean one b/c it wasn't as rich. \n\nThe shrimp tamale.....was.....like my aunt's if she were to make tamales out of shrimp. Yes that means it tastes like food my family could make but that's a good thing. And I'm only referring to the corn meal part of the tamale. It was flavored beautifully not overly lard-y which always happens at southwest places eww. But the shrimp sauce that was 5 star chef stuff all the way. Again after attempting to tackle the entire quesadilla (got through 3/4!) eating the whole tamale was not gonna happen but I made a valiant effort. \n\nIn the end we were left very satisfied, aka full and with 4 apps and two cactus (prickly pear) margaritas plus tax and tip we paid about 115....ya it was a special dinner and it was Bobby Flay's place...otherwise ya 4 apps..100 bucks!...ok well 25 of it is two drink but still! you get the point. \n\nBut you gotta try this place!"

I have been 15-20 times over the last 5 years and had just about everything on the menu. Perhaps because of this the negative reviews sort of infuriate me. Mesa Grill is not Chilis- yes they both proclaim to offer great southwestern food but Mesa Grill is a big girl restaurant- they don't serve southwest egg rolls or big mouth bites. They don't have a 20 page long menu with 5,000 items on it. Food costs more than 4.99 during happy hour. These shouldn't be controversial facts but apparently they are enough to justify a negative rating. There needs to be some sort of basic restaurant literacy exam you take before you can post reviews on yelp. Wait, hold on, did negative yelp reviews just turn me into a tea party republican? Ruh roh....\n\n\nDrinks\nRegular margarita- I know a lot of people don't like to get adventerous with their drinks and if that is the case you can't go wrong with the house margarita- it is not as sweet as you may be used to with many places now putting agave nectar in their drinks but it is not face puckeringly bitter. \n\nCactus Pear - this is the best by far. Yes it is pink, that doesn't mean it isn't manly. \n\n\nAppetizers- in Order\n\nBlue Corn Lobster Tacos- Winner. These are so frigging good its ludicrous. I normally don't like relish, fennel or hananero and yet I love this relish. \n\nBlue Corn pancake- comes with tasty duck meat and a slightly spicy sauce\n\nChicken Black Bean Quesadilla- the garlic sauce that comes on this is slightly more addictive than heroin. \n\nGoat Cheese Queso- its not quite dippable queso but is also not actual gross fundido- pretty tasty. \n\n\nEntres- In order\n\nPork Tenderloin- this one is always on the restaurant week menu so I have had more than my fair share of it. it is super delicious. It comes with three different sauces on the plate (for three pieces of tenderloin) and they are all good. It also comes with a sweet potato tamale thing that is amazing.\n\nVeal Chop- I don't like horseradich so I get it without- other than that this dish is perfect. I think the tamale is cheese (goat cheese?) - I'm not really sure because I inhaled it before I could figure it out. \n\nBone in Ribeye- this is an outstanding steak for a non steak restaurant. Its like 50 bucks- less than you would pay at Carne Vino and the like. It has a really good smoky glaze on it so if you are a steak purist (only want meat taste) this is probablynot for you\n\n\nSide Dishes- In order\n\nSweet potato Gratin\nTwice baked potato\n\nDesert\nThis changes a lot- the churros and any pie I have had have all been top notch."

I have never tasted anything like it or even heard or anything like it. I was pleasantly surprised by its taste, which was a little sweet with the tamale and savory because of the taste of the shrimp. Perfect flavor and unique combination. \n\nOrdered the lamb porterhouse chops. The flavor of the lamb was also a little sweet but over all delicious. This is where I had to take a star off though - the lamb was over cooked. I had asked for medium and received medium well. I didn't complain because the seasoning was delicious, but I would hope that a place that capitalizes on grilling would grill meat how they said they would. We spoke with the waitress afterward and she said that some of the cooks in the back were getting orders that were either overcooked or undercooked. I don't care how amazing the flavors are...that isn't cool. \n\nThe service here was exceptional, I came here with a large group and there were no mix ups with our orders and they knew exactly what they were doing. Friendly staff who were willing to listen to us and really cared if we liked the food. One person in our party had a steak that was very overcooked and before he mentioned anything the waitress saw his disappointment and had a new dish made up for him. My dish wasn't bad enough to send back and I was starving by that time so not too much complaining about my lamb."

She got the Scrambled Egg Chilaquiles and I got the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. Both dishes looked small, but man when we finished them we had to be rolled out of the restaurant! I liked the Chilaquiles over the Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. The texture of the chilaquiles was unlike the traditional mexican version that allows some of the chips to soften as it sits in the serving dish. This version was built on large tortilla chips/tostadas with layers of cheese, sauce, and eggs. It had a wonderful crunch that complimented the soft cheese, egg and sauce.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend the cactus-pear iced tea. Delicious!!"

            "review": "I have dined at Mesa Grill four times since living in Las Vegas, and have been very pleased with my meal every time.  It's not often that I enjoy a meal I had on the strip, as most of the strip restaurants are overpriced, and serve average food with a celebrity name on it.  Bobby Flay created a great restaurant, and I think it's very telling of the chef that Bobby Flay is.  Many don't like his conceited attitude, but he makes great food and does it while running many restaurants.  \n\nThe decor is very unique, and is perfect for it's location.  It is located in the Caesar's Palace, right next to the sportsbook.  The restaurant is scattered with a mosaic of rusty, yet bright colors.  The colors represent the southwestern theme of the restaurant, with influences of South America. \n\nThe service at Mesa Grill is top notch.  When your water is even close to done, it will be full.  When your drink is almost gone, they will ask you if you want a new one.  The corkage fee is $35, which is a bit steep for a place like this, but it's not too bad considering it's Las Vegas.  The waiters always have great suggestions, and are very knowledgeable on the menu and the terms of Southwestern cuisine.  \n\nThere are several signature items on the menu that are must-order items.  One of them is the Blue Corn, Duck Pancake.  BBQ duck is shredded and put into a blue corn pancake, and is topped with Habanero-Star Anise sauce.  This is the best appetizer.  Another great appetizer is the \"Queso Fundido\", a cheese dip made with goat cheese that is easy for the whole table to eat, and is the best cheese dip I've ever had.  \n\nThe best entree I've had here, and their signature entree, is the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  The portion is pretty big, and the pork is cooked perfect every time I've had it.  It is served with a sweet-potato tamale, and a bourbon-ancho chile sauce.  I have had this 3 times, and every time it has been the best thing at the table.  \nThe other entree that I recommend is the Lamb Porterhouse Chops, served with Red Chile, Lime, and Rosemary.  If there was any dish that could be better than the Pork Tenderloin, it's the Lamb Porterhouse Chops.  Although, if you like fish, try the Spice Rubbed Tuna, which is also very good.  \nIf you want a steak, there are 3 steak options on the menu.  All of them are very good, but not as unique as the other menu items.  There is a chipotle-glazed Ribeye, Coffee-rubbed Filet Mignon, and a New York Strip Steak served w/ their house-made Steak Sauce.  If you are looking to sample signature Bobby Flay cuisine, do not get the steaks.  But if you are the person in the group who wanted to go to the steakhouse, this is not a bad second option for a great steak.  \n\nIn conclusion, do not let your opinion of Bobby Flay steer you away from eating at Mesa Grill.  You may not like the guy, but the cuisine he cooks is a full of bold, unique flavors, and combines those flavors perfectly to show you why Bobby Flay is so popular."

This is more of a casual dining experience that happens to be expensive in price tag. haha. While delivering our food to us, our server dropped my hubbys rabbit on the floor :( I think the leg bone was stuck under the other plate and when he went to place it on the table, something happened and we just saw a rabbit hit the side of our table and fall to the floor. It was so so sad. \n\nThe waiter apologized profusely (well, if \"sorry brah, sorry sorry ah, so sorry bro\" counts as profusely apologizing haha), and then said he will fire up a new one asap! Cool. Mistakes happen, so that's understandable. What I didn't like however, was that my scallop dish and our other side dishes were sent to wait under the warmer while a new rabbit was fired. It took around 8-9 minutes (umm yes, of course I timed it!). That means my scallop entree sat under a warmer for 8-9 minutes and so did my brussel sprouts and queso mashed potatoes. I don't know if that was the right call. I guess I can't expect them to make all new items, but it just was sad watching my scallops just sit there. It just felt like my food's quality suffered a bit because of their boo boo. \n\nThat being said, the food was damn good. haha. The shrimp garlic corn tamale with cream sauce thing was soooooo good. I wanted like 3 more orders. The rabbit (when we did get it) was very tender and juicy and delicious, and the scallops in brown butter were yummy. The brussel sprouts had good flavor, but I wish they were more of a crispy style. Instead they were soggy and drowned in liquid. But the pomegranate was very unexpected and surprisingly very yummy when paired with the brussel sprout. Queso mashed potatoes was like a really thick mashed potato soup and was really yummmy :) \n\nOverall, I would definitely eat at Mesa again. I think the food itself was really delicious, I just don't know if service (from the sorry brah action, to the leaving my food on a warmer for 9 minutes) was up to par. I think that for the price tag you are paying (about $30 - $50 an entree), you expect a level of service that you just don't get here."

I was nervous because I've never had Brussel Sprouts and hear all the child horror stories. Boy was I relieved. This side was awesome! The pomegranate pairing was perfect and the sprouts were full of this nutty, roasted flavor. YUM-O!\n\nDon't know why he lost a Michelin star a couple years ago but who cares, I give it a Good Year star."

The salmon was fishy, the tuna was overcooked, the house specialty margarita was average, everything was overpriced for what you get. The service was average, and they didn't even offer us a celebratory birthday drink or dessert. Very un-Iron Chef like Mr. Flay. We won't be returning."

We would have left at that point, but we were too hungry to find another place.  \n\nOur waitress Christine was delightful and the food was very good.  I had the smoked shrimp tacos, which were delicious but a bit salty.  Plus, there were only 6 little shrimp on a $22 plate. \n\nWe were all too hung over to get a drink, but the tequila selection was extensive and looked quite tempting.  \n\nOverall, I'd go back and not dress like a scumbag so I can sit in the restaurant.

            "review": "First off let me just say that I do not believe this place is worth going to for dinner. For the money, you can get much better food at countless restaurants on the strip. You don't need a white guy from NYC introducing you to Southwest cuisine. If you care about Iron Chef, excited about the idea of paying $18 for a tamale or can't experience something like Yucatan flavors where you're from, then I say go for it. \n\nWith all that being said, I have been here for brunch two times and had a decent experience. The prices are reasonable, they have straight forward dishes and I was able to get mezcal, which isn't so easy to find in Vegas. My girlfriend and I were going to be in Vegas for Christmas and I thought this would be a good option for Holiday brunch. I called and made a reservation for brunch and there was no mention made of any changes. When we got there, the restaurant was noticibly empty and we were told that brunch was not being served for Christmas, and only the dinner menu (not even the lunch menu) was available. The waiter mentioned that he was sorry and this has resulted in several walkouts throughout the day. We walked out and I felt terrible because the loss of business affects the wait staff as much as anybody and it was Christmas. However, we came specifically for brunch, was never told that only the dinner menu would be available and as I mentioned earlier, wouldn't pay for the dinner fare. I know this is extremely case specific, but the whole experience was a major letdown and perhaps it is magnified more because it was Christmas. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place anyways except for brunch. \n\n-JRS"

Oh I could have sat there and keep drinking that all day long.  Unfortunately I wasn't too wild about the appetizer queso fundido, I mean it was good, but it's melted cheese. Ok i get it. \n\nI had grilled pork tenderloin that was decent but not great, and the bf had shrimp tacos suggested by the waiter. I thought the shrimp was really good but a rip off since the plate had only 6 shrimps and 2 tortillas!!!  Wow, really, Bobby? That's an appetizer size, not entree size!\n\nOverall, it's just an OK place to eat at with a heavy tab. If you have a big wallet and a small stomach, this might be the place to hang out at. I do love the drink, but what I love more is to eat."

This was our first meal of the day and we were starving.  We had a short wait of about 15 minutes but had a drink while we waited.  Our server greeted right away and his assistant brought us water and assortment of bread.  First of all the bread was really good.  There was a combination of mini bite size jalapeno cheese biscuit, blue corn and yellow corn bread (the best corn bread I've ever had) and two fruit type of pastry bars.  \n\nFor the appetizers we had the tiger shrimp tamales and a crispy bacon hash quesadilla topped with a over easy egg.  Both were outstanding.  My wife had the chillaquilles and I had the burger.  Both entrees were delicious and so flavorful.  \n\nService was on par and the atmosphere was great.

Now this is what i call a throw down!\n\nOf course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   \n\nIt was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  \n\nTruth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  \n\nAs we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. \n\nWithin moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.\n\nIn record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. \nLet's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! \n\nHere's a rundown of what we had:\n\nShrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! \n\nTuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!\n\nPork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends \"Are you sure this is pork?\" \n\nSpice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!\n\nLamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!\n\nCorn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!\n\nAfter consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)\n\nOverall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!\n\nWhy? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol\n\nHappy Eats!"

Definitely a pricey meal, but worth it if you're cool with it.\n\nThree friends and I visited Mesa Grill for the first time during CES 2013.  We made reservations for 8:45pm and showed up a few minutes early.  We waited for 15 minutes or so to be seated and I imagine that is the norm.  Soon after we were asked what type of water we wanted and greeted by our server.  He took our drink order and we selected our starting beers.  The beer selection was not big but was high quality.  Good stuff.  The wine-by-the-glass selection was not very impressive and had a pinot noir listed under the white wines.  Strange.\n\nWe scanned the menu and selected our entrees.  A basket of olive bread and jalapeno bread was placed at our table so we noshed on that as we placed our orders.\n\nCoffee Ground Filet - This was my entree.  A pretty large filet mignon, perfectly cooked to my specs (medium), and sliced horizontally so that the top half rested on top of the bottom half.  The texture and quality of the beef was fantastic, as expected.  The taste was superb.  At $50, this was a pricey piece of beef, but it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.\n\nMashed Potatoes with Queso Sauce - A nice little cup of creamy mashed potatoes with a little queso sauce on top.  Very tasty and smooth.  An excellent pairing dish with the steak.\n\nPork Tenderloin - I nabbed a bite from one of my friends.  This was the first pork tenderloin I had ever had.  It was very tender, very flavorful, and otherwise delicious. \n\nTwice Baked Potato - I got to sample another friend's side.  This is basically a half potato that is super soft on the inside and has a layer of crispiness on the outside.  This was really good, too.\n\nThe only disappointment in the meal was for one of my friends that got a NY steak.  He has for it medium rare and it came out way too rare.  He asked for it to be cooked a little more, and when it was brought back out it was done much better.  Aside from that hiccup, everything about the meal was fantastic.  The prices were not cheap.  Obviously, that is to be expected.  Overpriced?  Yeah, probably to an extent.  However, the quality of the food, service, and experience was excellent.  I would definitely consider coming back again if I had some money to burn."

A few minutes after we were seated the waiter came over and asked if we wanted drinks we said no because we had just had a few while in the casino and wanted to enjoy our meal...he then really pushed the margarita menu and walked away annoyed that we didn't want one.  A few minutes later he came back and asked what we would like to order, I had a few questions about the menu items and once again he was annoyed. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin and I the smoked chicken quesadilla, I asked if I could get some lettuce with my quesadilla and he looked and me and sharply said \"NO\"!!!  I asked if I could have my quesadilla easy on the black beans and he said no the beans are already \"pre-pasted\" at that point I wanted to change my order but worried if I did he would spit in my food! We also ordered the corn with cotija cheese. SERIOUSLY no more that 7 minutes after we ordered our meal was delivered to our table, great if you are at casual eatery but the look and feel of our meal was VERY manufactured. My husband said the first few bites of his tenderloin were good and then the heavily salted and spiced taste got old. My quesadilla was slightly burnt on the bottom but was edible. The corn was sooo salty we had to send it back and we never send food back, but we thought since our waiter was being such a jerk...why not. We exchanged the corn for the asparagus and that was much better. We ate fast an just wanted to get out of the restaurant! It is literally the WORST dining experience we have ever had in Las Vegas"

From the start, the service was great and the waitress had great recommendations and patience (everything sounded tasty). The bread basket contains a mixture of breads (one on the sweeter side, one more savory consisting of cheese and jalepeno, and a corn bread muffin). The veal chop (with bone) and wild rice tamale were excellent. Great flavors and perfectly cooked. The margarita that I had was tasty too. Overall fantastic experience. I'd love to give it 5, but I only upgrade when I've visited multiple times and can test the consistency."

Server provided recommendations without needing to be asked.  Constant water refills when only partially empty.  Great service overall.\n\nItems ordered:\n- Blue Corn Pancake w/ Duck BBQ -- this is my wife's absolute favorite item here, and it was ok but definitely not as good as in the past.  This alone is one of the primary reasons we keep coming back, so that was disappointing.\n- Tiger Shrimp w/ roasted corn tamale -- this was good, although there could have been more of it.  It's an appetizer though, so that's kinda the norm.\n- Entree - Shrimp tacos w/ avocado, tomatillo, mango sauces, citrus cilantro slaw.  This was a suggestion from the waiter.  Just average, nothing great.    Would not order this again.\n- Entree - Yucatan Chicken Skewers -- horribly disappointing. 3 tiny pieces of chicken with peanut chile aioli, with 2 tiny dried up tortillas.  I couldn't believe it was so bad.\n\nSeating is very close quarters, to the point that it's uncomfortable trying to have a conversation.  You are literally in the conversations of people next to you, and while that may be an attractive feature of a family-style restaurant, it's not appropriate in this location.  Definite minus for that.\n\nMesa Grill has always been one of our \"must-go\" stops on previous trips.  We've been there twice before this visit, but both visits were for dinner.   This is the first time that the food was not stellar, and that's the only reason this is a 3-star review and not a 2.  Price is not an issue, because it's pretty standard for Vegas strip places and the food was always great previously and worth every penny.  We *might* go back next time we visit, but it's definitely off the \"I can't leave Vegas without going\" list."

My only complain with the soup is that It wasn't as warm as I like, and the portion was tiny :(, but really good, left us wishing for more. The shrimp corn tamale is delicious and so was the Mahi Mahi with spicy risotto. My son ordered the langostinos, and these were perfectly cooked and gigantic!

From the food to the wine selection to the service everything was simply spectacular. I will say we ran our bill up pretty high, but that was completely due  to our wine selections.  (I thought the entree prices were quite reasonable.) Our sommelier (Heidi) was incredibly helpful and friendly in her recommendations. I had the Black Angus Strip steak. It was cooked medium-rare (as I requested) and it was delicious. The house made steak sauce was very good as well, but to be honest I liked the rub on the steak so much I did not use much of the sauce. I strongly recommend the Tiger Shrimp Tamale appetizer as well as Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck.\n\nOne note, if you are looking for a quiet place, this probably is not the spot. I know our group was on the louder side so we had no issues with the ambiance at all. It is a vibrant happening spot with a great energy.

We were a party of 8 people and the 4 people that ordered the fish dishes were all disappointed.  I had the lambchop which was pretty good but did not blow me away.  Our friend who's 40th bday it was and is a BIG Bobby Flay fan loved his pork tenderloin and that was the most important thing since it was his birthday.  \nIn terms of service, they definitely lose a star ( or more ).  Was not impressed.  Our waiter was friendly enough but just going through the motions, this is Vegas buddy, there are a million places to eat, you gotta step it up !!  There was nothing terrible about the service through out most of the meal but nothing that stood out as good either.  The real kicker came though at the end of the meal when birthday boy went to the bathroom and I asked the waiter if he could bring out a piece of cake or something with a candle in it for the bday boy.  He said \"if you buy a dessert we can stick a candle in it \"  Excuse me!?!? We just dropped $800 and you can't splurge for a piece of cake, he came out instead with a ramekin with whipped cream and a candle stuck in it, was actually embarrassing.   Yes, we could have bought a piece of dessert but at that point it was the principal of the matter.\nThe other annoyance ( which happens at most places these days ) Is the automatic 18% gratuity for groups of 8 or more.  We were forced to tip this amount for sub-par service and spotty food.  \n\nHaving been to Vegas 9 times, I would say that I would not rush to eat here, there are soooooo many other better choices.  I have walked by this place about 50 times and never had an urge to go in, my hunch was right."

            "review": "I was in Las Vegas for a conference and brought two of my students to Mesa Grill for dinner. Throughout dinner the wait staff were super - very attentive, prompt with our order, and helpful. Service is very important and the waiters can make or break a Restuarant - in our case they totally made our night enjoyable. \n\nNow moving to our meals. We ordered 2 shrimp tamales which were exquisite and I am a huge tamale fan so I know a good tamale when I taste it!!! I would definitely recommend the tamales. We also ordered as our main dishes - a tuna steak, the ancho salmon, and the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. Each dish was prepared to perfection. I had the pork tenderloin and I would go back to Mesa Grill to have this again any day. It's easy to see why Bobby Flay is a celebrity chef and although he did not prepare the meal personally he has great chefs preparing meals for his guests.\n\nI know that some folks complain about the small portion sizes at a place like Mesa Grill, but all I have to say is, if you want a lot of food go to a place that has a buffet that's why they exist; however, I'll continue to go to Mesa Grill for a great meal experience."

You do make a fine margarita however.\n\nIf you want severely overpriced southwestern food (even for Vegas) that I believe doesn't properly represent authentic southwestern food, then give this place a try. Personally, I'll save my money and travel to Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and eat the real thing. It might actually cost less as well....\n\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, there are much better placed to blow $100+ on dinner and drinks in Vegas.

I ordered the pre-fixe menu with green pea and green chile soup, grilled scallops, and vanilla ice cream with protiferoles. My bf had the blue corn pancake and ancho chili-honey glazed salmon. AMAZING. Everything was great. The serrano ham gave it a little kick, but even without it, its still delicious. The scallops were grilled and served on top of tortilla chips and guac. Two scallops for the lunch portion. The blue corn pancake with duck was SO good, with a little asian influence. The salmon was awesome. Probably the best salmon we have ever had. Great balance of savory and sweet. I'm not a huge fan of protiferoles because they taste so stale to me. The dessert is nothing to write home about. But who cares!! Everything else makes up for it.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun and lively, but still able to maintain intimate atmosphere. The portions were perfect for lunch and we also ordered margaritas. I had a virgin white pear margarita and my bf ordered their organic margarita, which he said was good, but not great. Service was excellent, except for one detail. Maybe I'm spoiled, but in a restaurant like Mesa Grill, I expect the servers to always clean up your crumbs before each meal served. We made reservations for lunch, but from what I noticed, you don't need to. We did come on a weekday though.\n\nI'd love to come here again for dinner next time!"

That is one of the perks of eating at a restaurant owned by one of the more well-known chefs in the country... they always have knowledgeable, informed, and helpful staff. \n\nTo start, they give you homemade corn muffins made with yellow and blue cornmeal. These were very tasty! I can't remember the rest of the bread basket contents, but the corn muffins really stood out. \n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the gala apple salad. If I came for lunch I would probably order this as my meal... delicious. Great combination of flavors, and I especially loved the combination of toasted pecans with spicy orange vinaigrette!\n\nSadly for me, the restaurant only has 1 vegetarian entree option. But that is probably more than most places. It was the cornmeal crusted chile relleno. Normally more cheese than I would order for a meal, but it was a good choice. The chili is stuffed with manchego cheese and red peppers which was a real delight. Very flavorful, definitely not your average dish from a Mexican restaurant! It was very rich, and I was already pretty full from my salad so I took most of it back to the hotel. Yummy, and not a bad option for vegetarians, but sometimes I wish restaurants had less cheesy options as well. \n\nFor dessert, our table of 4 split the banana cream pie and sticky toffee pudding. Although I had no complaints about the banana cream pie, the sticky toffee pudding was really my favorite. It was to die for!! \n\nWith dessert, our waiter recommended something called \"tequila crema\" that is apparently one of Bobby Flay's specials. YUM! Ask for this if you get a chance. It is a sweet, creamy, spicy dessert drink that we all loved. Overall, a great experience here!"

You MUST order it when you come here. \n\nUnfortunately, everything else was so-so. My margarita was a little too sweet for my liking. I didn't care for the bread options, a jalape\u00f1o corn bread and a spicy French bread. I ordered a burger because I've always wanted to try one of Bobby's burgers, but I was soo disappointed! Perhaps I had really high expectations? But it wouldn't even make my top 10 favorite burgers. Although it was gorgeous, the burger patty had some meat tendons in it that skeeved me out, it was so greasy that when I picked it up everything kind of slid off of the bun so it was super hard to eat. The southwestern fries were ok as well, they were really just seasoned fries. For an $18 burger I expected a lot more.\n\nThe service was great though, fast and efficient. It is a little tight in here, we were sat at a table for 2 and were almost rubbing elbows with the table next to us.\n\nI have dined at other Bobby Flay restaurants and fallen in love, I won't give up on him just yet!"

We were seated next to a partial wall and the seam from the drywall and the wood was very unprofessional and chips out of the drywall something I would expect from a low class place.

At first, I was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"Mesa Grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.\n\nSERVICE: \n5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!\n\nFOOD:\nBread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\nSpanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  \n\nFor our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!\n\nI sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  \n\nAll in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!"

Actually, I think we walked into the restaurant not expecting much.\n\nBut we were wowed. The service was great even though the tables in this place are super close to each other and I got the waiter's butt in my face more than once when he was helping the table next to us. Sometimes we get bad service because they expect us not to tip well (because we're young?) and that really pisses me off. So I tipped really well since he was so attentive!\n\nThe food was really the highlight of the night though. Kyle got the cioppino and I got the grilled black grouper. Fantastic! We started the evening off with the goat cheese fondue and ended it with the blue corn pudding. Yummy!

Twice before I had the pork tenderloin sandwich with french fries and I have recommended it to friends who have also raved. Thus, six months later I returned with friends and ordered a pork tenderloin sandwich. The waiter got busy and I could see the food in the window so long that they took the fries away and replaced them with another batch. Eventually, other waiters brought our food to us. The sandwich was good but the portion of pork seemed smaller and the fries were not as good as I remember. Honestly, I may be splitting hairs but I truly believe that the care and attention to detail in the front and back of the house has declined. With so many options in LV and even at Caesars, I will think twice before returning. Bobby are you listening? I'm a former restaurant professional, extreme foodie and a big fan!"

Okay, that may be a bit of a stretch, but it was definitely up there in terms of superior deliciousness.  My husband and I started with the blue corn lobster tacos.  Who knew you could shove so much flavor into three little tacos?! There were decent chunks of lobster and the balance of spicy, sweet and tart was spot on.  It was $20 for three tiny little tacos, but I can say with some certainty that I would definitely order them again. \n\nOkay, on to the entrees--I ordered the grilled lamb porterhouse chops and they were phenomenal.  They were tender, perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. A preserved serrano chile sauce and mint chimichurri accompanied the lamb and it was a combination of sauces that you pretty much want to put on everything. The blue corm tamale with basil butter was also pretty tasty, but I liked the goat cheese tamale that came with my husband's veal a little better.  Overall, I thought my dish was slightly better than his, but he devoured his plate easily and with no hesitations, so I doubt he felt the same.  \n\nOh did I forget to mention the bread basket?  Also delicious of course.  The jalepeno corn bread was my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. The crusty french bread and blue corn muffin was also just ridiculous.\n\nWe were so full after all this food that we skipped dessert.  This was probably a huge mistake as I imagine the desserts were probably equally as mind blowing.  I suppose this just gives us an excuse to go back the next time we're in town.

This was the worst ribeye...actually the worst piece of meat I've ever eaten. Totally undercooked (and I like a good piece of rare meat) and worse: absolutely no flavor. I enjoy the fat on a ribeye but this had way more fat than usual. The honey glaze and the other sauces were okay, but I wasn't even interested in the meat. Service was slow (which was fine, we weren't in a hurry at first) but by the time I bit into that meat I was ready to leave. I didn't bother complaining to my waiter because I knew it would take too long to bring out something else and by that time we were ready to get back to the craps table. Found it interesting that the waiter didn't ask if something was wrong when he cleared my plate and there were only 2 bites taken out. Maybe I hit this place on an off night but I don't think I'd be willing to go again to find out. Too many other good places to eat in Vegas. Skip this one."

No one was \"over the top\" in their praise.\n\nThe side dishes were ridiculously small and absurdly overpriced.\n\nThe setting was beautiful - lots of glass with casino views.\n\nI suppose Mesa Grill qualifies as a moderate to high priced \"upscale\" restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. It's about what I expected in a tourist trap town."

I have to say the food was okay nothing great or worth the price.\nThe service on the other hand was excellent and they were on top of everything without being intrusive. \n\nI think I will try Bobby's other restaurants to see if the food is better."

But the food reviews here are so mixed, I was a bit hesitating to spend my money even for lunch at Mesa Grill in Vegas.  My sister and I were too tired to find a better place, we decided to try our first Bobby Flay food.\n\nWe were there for Sunday Brunch around noon after Christmas and we're seated right away.  Our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.  \n\nWe wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  All three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  That surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, I would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  We're very disappointed and ordered cactus pear iced tea instead.  It wasn't bad but nothing special about it. \n\nThe warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  The first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  I don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and I wished I had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  I can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but I can say they were good.  And the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  It was delicious.  Our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, I saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  The ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so I couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us. \n\nI ordered their honey glazed salmon and my sister ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  My salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  The honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  I had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  Was it cheap?  No, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...\n\nI don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in Vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch."

            "review": "We have been wanting to try Mesa Grill ever since I have been watching Bobby Flay on the Food Network. We finally decided to make it a point to try it the next time we were in Vegas and so this is how it went... \n\nI made reservations for two at around 1230pm the same day for dinner at 930pm on a Thurs night, no problem, they use a service to take the reservation and take a credit card number to hold the reservation. They charge a $50 per person holding fee if you back out of the reservation after 300pm. No problem with that; this is to discourage anybody from simply calling to make reservations and not showing up. We showed up a little early at 900pm and they were able to give us the next table for two that opened up; this was significant since there was a party of 4 who arrived just before us who didn't have reservations and they were told that the wait was going to be an hour. \n\nWe sat down at the bar to wait and ordered a couple of drinks: a Partida margarita and a cactus pear ice tea (nonalcoholic). The margarita was good but it also tasted a bit on the tangy side; the ice tea which was unsweetened tasted like an ordinary unsweetened ice tea without any seeming cactus pear taste (maybe it's not meant to be since this is the only ice tea that they offer). After about 10 minutes our table was ready and we had our drinks transferred to our table. \n\nThey have a pretty extensive list of wine but we skipped it since we already had our drinks and I don't drink very much anyway. The waitress was very friendly, attentive, and helpful the entire evening. She took her time and explained everything about the menu and even made some recommendations based on our preferences. \n\nWe shared an appetizer of Rough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" with Mango-Habanero Hot Sauce and Avocado Crema. This was a mound of tuna tartar on a bed of the two sauces flanking either side with regular and blue tortilla disks stacked and layed out like pringles. Surprisingly, the avocado crema had a slight kick to it and the mango-habanero was mostly sweet, I was expecting it to be the other way around but after watching Bobby Flay on tv, I remember that he likes to offer surprises in his food in unexpectedly tasty ways. Although I'm sure that the fish dishes are good, I didn't want to come to a place called Mesa Grill and order a fish dish, I wanted to order something off the grill like beef or pork and sample his renowned southwest flair. The tuna was tasty and was a perfect compromise to get a sample of his fish and still have room for the main course. \n\nFor entries, she ordered the grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops, two generously thick medium-rare shoulder chops served with a Jalapeno-Mint sauce and a well made plantain tamale. Tasty but a little tougher than expected, maybe we were expecting Frenched lamb chops like a rack of lamb but in any case we both liked what I had better: the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. This was also a generously large single veal chop with a horseradish-maple glaze that had a slight kick to it but didn't interfere with the taste of the tender flavorful juicy veal chop. The exposed bone was leaning on top of a beautiful little wild rice filled tamale with sage butter. Wonderful melt in your mouth tenderness and flavor. \n\nWe needed something sweet to finish off all of the various flavors and textures we just experienced and so we shared a banana creme pie served upside-down with crispy thin vanilla(?) wafer on top of it. A perfect combination of sweet and crispy texture to finish the meal. \n\nThe atmosphere was casual but nice with elegant touches but understated and not stuffy at all. The food was a little pricey, especially the main dishes, but actually not too bad considering how satisfied we were. I would like to come again to try some more dishes. \n\nEntertaining side story: My wife excused herself to wash her hands when we were done but came out of the ladies room and told me that she would wait and use another restroom in Caesar's... the reason being that when she entered the ladies room, she could hear someone else in one of the stalls driving the big ceramic bus and puking her guts out! Eeeewwwwww, Gross! I guess even a fancy place like Mesa Grill can have someone who was probably inexperienced and drank to excess at the bar... 'what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas...'"

Says volumes about a restaurant when they put so  much care in their nibbles.  My fav of the 4 different bread types was the blue corn muffin.  Dab of butter and you're done.\n-Honey Glazed Salmon.  Spiced and cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested.  Served on top of a yummy black bean puree.\n-Roasted Corn.  A side order of corn niblets baked in a cheesy/creamy/spicy sauce.  Not too heavy, but a great accompaniment.\n\nF-ING AWESOME:\n-Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye Steak.  WOW  WOW  WOW.  Best steak preparation I've had in a long time if ever.  Slightly charred and crispy on the outside and juicy and tender inside.  The glaze was not spicy at all, just light, smokey, and a tad sweet.  Sooo worth the $48 bucks.  As good as the salmon was, I stopped short of finishing it just so that I could have more Rib Eye.\n\nService was never under foot and timed well.  Can't wait to come back!"

I forgot his name, but he has been at Mesa Grill since its opening and has so much knowledge regarding the menu and drinks. \n\nWe ordered margaritas, I highly recommend the White Peach Margarita, and Don Julio on the rocks. They have so many tequilas so there is definitely something for everyone. The bread basket that came with the drinks was so good! I loved how our waiter explained the breads to me: asiago cheese, grain with walnuts, and of course their famous corn muffin (my favorite)\n\nFor the appetizer we ordered their famous Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, it was absolutely delicious and the flavors infused in that little tamale was awesome! \n\nEntrees we ordered the 22oz Bone In Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye and the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. The Veal came with a sweet potato tamale, and we ordered the mashed potatoes + green chile queso sauce to accompany the rib-eye. The Veal and Rib-Eye were cooked to perfection and the sides were awesome as well. I really loved the spicy kick to both the sauces. \n\nMy favorite out of the two was probably the rib-eye since the horseradish flavor in the veal was a little too strong for my taste, but delicious nevertheless. \n\nThe service was on point as well as the cuisine, and compared to other Vegas high end restaurants the pricing was very fair and I will definitely be back again!"

I have eaten here a few times in the past couple of years. Each time I have had a great experience. The must try items are the tiger shrimp tamale, the rough cut tuna nachos, crab cakes, spicy chicken sweet potato hash, the chile rellenos, and their desserts.\n\nThere is a reason why Mesa wins every year when it comes to the most money raised for our local food bank. They put out a well balanced menu that gives the guest the biggest bang for their buck. The portion sizes are scaled back, but leaves you feeling full. I started with the rough cut tuna nachos for my appetizer. It is served like tuna poki. The fish is sashimi grade and served raw. Tosses with chipotle puree, cilantro, capers, and placed on top of a mango habanero puree and avocado crema. The blue corn and tortilla chips are the only utensils you need to scoop up all of this deliciousness. \n\nI got the crab cakes last year when they ran this special which lead me to order the green chile burger this time around. The meat tends to lose it's form and crumbles easily. I ended up using a fork and knife halfway through. The bechamel cheese sauce is delicious. Paired with the pickled onions and pablano peppers gave it a range of depth. If given the choice again, I would have gone with the crab cakes. \n\nThe desserts changes ever day depending on what the chef chooses. We got the deep dish banana cream pie. The Frangelico cream only gives hints of the alcohol. The surprise comes from the contrast in textures. The dense custard differs from the soft cream which compliments the bananas and praline disk on top. I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay's desserts. The sticky toffee pudding is not a traditional version, but it is so good. I also like the strawberry shortcake. Pastry changes their offerings seasonally, so keep an eye out for these dishes."

I was dragged to dine here in a way, but we definitely had a great time.\n\nSooo...welcome to Vegas, where people gamble while they eat and sleep (duggh). The restaurant is just located at the heart of Caesars Palace, where you can actually dine while looking at people losing their money. Other than that, the restaurant still retains its an upper-class atmosphere. Therefore, please dress appropriately if you want to dine in the dining area instead of the bar. (Don't be like me. I was wearing a tank top, which was a big mistake.)\n\nNevertheless, the waiter(s) still greeted me friendly & guide us to the bar area for lunch, not to mention that the bartender had a great conversation with us. It was very pleasant to be served by these folks.\n\nI had a smoked salmon club for lunch. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say the club sandwich was up to my expectation. The sandwich was way too moist, which made it fallen apart very easily. Also, probably it was because of the moist of the fish, the sandwich was very greasy for me, and I found it very difficult to taste the freshness of the fish...I'm sorry, but it was a disappointment. However, the fries! The damn fries were just awesome! Not only the fries were crispy, but they also had house-mixed spice on them, which was incredibly delightful to eat them.\nMy colleague ordered a New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, which was a lot better than my club sandwich in my opinion. The pork with the spiced mayo was very well done. I would suggest you to give it a try rather than the smoked salmon club sandwich.\n\nOverall, the dining experience was nice because of the great customer service & the fries. However, I can't give anything more than 3 stars because my main dish just did not live up to my expectation."

It's an interesting setting, but not really my style. The menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce or Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash. Vlad ordered the latter and I ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side). \n\nAfter taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which IMO really was the highlight. The basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it's been sitting out all day. Vlad and I really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. While we waiting for our mains, I looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. The Mesa Burger does not mess around! It looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. Luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. In retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? Whatevs, it's Vegas. \n\nVlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. After taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. Actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that's about it. I had to pull off the \"sixteen spice\" fat from each chicken strip, which I believe was intentionally included for \"flavor\". Once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. I think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. It helped a little. The green onion one was the best tasting.  \n\nOverall, I'd come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. Perhaps the Roasted Pumpkin Soup with Smoked Chiles and Pomegranate Crema?"

Then I asked another employee, who had me turn right, when it should have been left.  The THIRD employee finally gave me accurate directions.  And, of course, this meant a lot of walking through the smoke-filled (cough, hack, wheeze) casino.  Ugh!  (Pro tip: If you want to get to Mesa Grill without inhaling too much cigarette smoke, enter Caesar's Palace from the front rather than the parking garage in the back.)\n\nFortunately, once we found the place, the hostess helpfully seated us as far away as she could from the smoke of the casino.  Our waiter was also very helpful.  My wife has a low tolerance for spicy heat, and he was able to help her find an entree that wouldn't be to spicy for her, the Blue Corn Crusted Halibut, but leaving out the jalepenos that are normally part of the dish.  When she tried to order the Plantain Tamale as a side dish, he sadly shook his head and said \"You don't want that.\"  (It sounds rude written out like that, but it really wasn't.)  At first, we thought he was joking, but then he explained that it was too dry.  He recommended a corn-based side dish instead, which she was very happy with.  \n\nI, on the other hand, was looking for some spice, and was very happy with the New Mexican Pork Tenderloin, with an Anaheim Chile Relleno on the side.  The pork tenderloin also came with a sweet potato tamale that my wife gleefully stole.\n\nAn unexpected benefit of where we were seated was a good view of the kitchen.  We particularly enjoyed watching the woman in charge of keeping the steady stream of dishes from different orders organized."

The soup was absolutely incredible with the maple cream and marcona almonds...highly recommend.\nWe shared the romaine salad, very good and not overdressed. Yummy cheese crisp in the middle. \nI had the filet mignon for dinner, perfectly medium rare and very very yummy. Spicy chipotle coating, which was not overpowering.\nHusband had the pork tenderloin - then it was my turn for food envy - wow. Extremely delicious, the sauce was to die for.\nCoconut cake for dessert, skip it. It was totally dry and tasteless. I was very sad because I love coconut cake. Eh.\nWould definitely go back!\nAs an FYI, most of the recipes that the restaurant uses are in Bobby Flay's cookbook...I'll be picking that up soon so I can make that soup. Mmmmm. I'm still dreaming about it."

Service was amazing and the atmosphere was modern and beautiful. Everything complimented each other perfectly. For an appetizer we ordered the rough cut tuna nachos. It looked gorgeous and the fish, sauces and oils were perfectly spicy and balanced! I could be happy just eating that itself. Then for my entree I ordered the coffee crusted filet mignon medium rare. Hands down amazing I can't even describe it. It's the best cut of meat I've ever had. Ever! I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes centered with creamy poblano cheese. I ate everything! My husband got the unshelled lobster with corn cakes. Absolutely tasty and father in law had the lamb chops with a tamale. Prices are expensive but totally worth it. You're in Vegas. Live a little. You'll be happy you went here."

Yup, why's the Grill Master have to have food so good that I keep coming back every time I'm in town? I didn't realize till recently that after all these visits to Mesa, I've never written a review. \n\nHere are some brunch items I've tried:\nAny of the quesadillas they have on the menu. I had the crispy bacon and hash brown quesadilla. \nSpicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Good portions and a nice southwest twist on the regular corned beef hash.\nMesa burger - A sign of a good burger for me is one that needs no condiments, is juicy, and has a soft bun. This burger has it.\nI'm a sucker for pastries so their brunch bread basket is SOOO delicious. The mini fresh scones were the best!\nThe cactus pear iced tea was really refreshing as well and not too sweet.\nBased on my last waiter's suggestion, I'll have to try the steak and eggs next time.\n\nHere are my thoughts on dinner items I've tried:\nCremini mushroom quesadilla - I order this every time!\nTiger shrimp corn tamale - Heard great things about it but was only Ok.\nNew Mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin - A very solid choice with just the right amount of heat. Pork is very tender.\nFire roasted veal chop - This is my fav!\nI still need to try the bone-in ribeye at some point.\n\nYou can ask for a side of their special chipolte sauce. It's great for dipping with the quesadillas or even your fries. I finish my dinner off usually with the deep dish banana cream pie. Never disappoints and guarantees that I end my dinner on a high note.\n\nStaff and service are always top notch. There's a side room that can be reserved for larger parties. Beverages are constantly refilled. Margaritas are tasty, but a bit on the pricier side. Food is always solid. Portions are just right. Price is not unreasonable. I'm always satisfied.\n\nReservations are recommended."

This is what I expect when we put down a $100 deposit to keep our reservation, the promise to show on time has to be honored by both parties right? We were greeted along the walk to our table and our server immediately introduced herself to us. She was very pleasant with taking our order, timing was perfect for the intervals between each visit to the table. She wished my fiancee a happy birthday multiple times (I mentioned it when I made the reservation).\n\nWe started trying some bread from the basket. I personally loved the jalapeno bread, not every bite had chunks of jalapeno in it, but every bite had the flavors. The blue corn bread was also good. I tried the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. When it first came out I thought the portion of meat was a bit smaller than I expected, however as I progressed through the meal, the portion was actually perfect and I typically eat a decent volume of food. The meat was cooked perfectly, so juicy. The side of sweet potato tamale was ok, didn't add much to the dish though. My fiance had the coffee rubbed filet mignon. The meat was tender and well seasoned, although the coffee taste was very very subtle if noticeable at all. The mushrooms in the sauce added to the flavors. She also had a white peach margarita, this was delicious. Has the tartness you would expect from a margarita but the added aromas of white peach made it much more enjoyable. \n\nDecor was fitting for the southwestern style that Bobby is known for. We wanted to try this place since it's the only US location open as of now, ever since the flagship in NY had been recently displaced. However, considering all the other celebrity chefs that have restaurants available in LV, we probably will not be back anytime soon until we've had the opportunity to experience some of the other options. Worth 1 try though!\n\nTIP: only come if you have made reservation, otherwise the wait seemed to be quite long as we walked out from our meal."

The wait staff is abundant and the place was teaming with high rollers and gorgeous people, then again why not, it's Bobby Flay's place, and it's in Caesars Palace.\nWe only had appetizers; I plan on going back for dinner later this year. \n\n$14.00 Goat Cheese \"queso fondido\" It had rajas and blue corn strips. I've had better goat cheese, but the idea of goat cheese in fondido sparked my curiosity, unfortunately the dish did not satisfy my curiosity. The rajas were rajitas, meaning they were sparse. The blue chips were too thin, they broke when you dipped them into the fondido. Did I mention the presentation was awesome. \n\nNext we had Crispy Squash Blossoms $15.00. Filled with Ricotta Cheese, Corn and basil with yellow Haberno sauce. I think I remember 3 or 4 on the plate. It was the only appetizer we completely devoured. They were fresh, crisp and very tasty. Wish we had two orders of Blossoms. They reminded me of chile rellenos without the pepper. Encore!!\n\nNext was the Blue Corn Pancake $15.00. It had BBQ Duck and a habanero Chile -Star Anise Sauce. Nice idea, but someone spilled the Hosin sauce into the Habenero sauce and ruined the whole concept. The duck was on the dry side and the pancake tasted like a corn pancake. A little oil and butter in the batter would have done wonders to the pancake. Nice try, but it needs to be re-worked or change the price to two bucks. \n\nWild Mushroom Quesadilla, came with white bean hummus and white truffle oil. $14.00. Not a home run, but I would say at least a double. It was tasty and moist. Had some magic chile powder sprinkled on top of the tortilla that needs to be reformulated. A call to McCormick should remedy this. I think a little garlic-butter instead of the chile powder would have earned a triple with me. \n\nI'm looking forward to going back sooner than later. The appetizers were good, but I can't wait to try the steak or lamb. I really love their open kitchen and the action behind the three dedicated grills in plain view for all the customers to witness their food being grilled fresh. \n\nI'd estimate this place does 15 to 17 million in annual sales given the number of tables, the bar and the advance notice we had to give just to get a reservation.  Great Job Bobby! Rock On Dawg."

I can definitely say that the food here was good but was it the best thing I've ever eaten?  I don't think so...\n\nFor brunch, I went with the shrimp tamale for a started and then rounded out my meal with the pork tenderloin sandwich.  The tamale was really good though a bit pricey at $15 and only came with 4 shrimp.  I guess when you eat at a \"celebrity\" chef's place, things will cost more.  But what if I don't even know who this \"celebrity\" chef is, you ask?  It doesn't matter, you're still going to pay celebrity chef prices but since it was good, I can say that the taste justified the cost.  The sauce they use with the tamale was great - I had to mix in the corn from the tamale with the sauce and shrimp and it hit the spot.\n\nAs for the tenderloin sandwich, it was pricey as well at $16 but it was also good.  The meat was really tender and flavored really well.  I thought the ancho chile mayonnaise they used for this sandwich was excellent as it was a combination of sweet, salty, and spicy!!  The fries were also really good with the southwestern spices they used and had the right crunch to them.  The meal was definitely filling and it took me some time to kill all the fries but in the end, they were gone.  I was too stuffed to even try a cocktail but my friend tried one of their margaritas and said it was good and had a lot of alcohol for $11.  Anyways, I would probably come back but not right away as there are so many other good places to eat in Vegas."

However, the bread basket was another story -- everything was so good, I just stuffed myself with it. My favourite has to be the cornbread followed by the jalapeno scone. \n\nI had the tiger shrimp with corn tamale, after hearing so much about it from various sources. It didn't disappoint! The sauce and the shrimp were tasty, and the corn tamale was bursting with loads of flavours. It's a must-try.\n\nThe wait service was...ok. Our waitress was nice but seemed a bit overwhelmed, and the bus service was just horrible. Bread came after we finished our appetizer. Things were served out of order and hectic, and cleared out of the way slowly.\n\nIn short, bring a big stomach to this place. The plates I got were \"appetizer-sized\" but they were enough to stuff me, especially after I devoured a couple pieces of pastries from the bread basket. Plus, you might want to get a couple different things to try since everything looks so good.\n\nOh, and just ignore the busboys."

We also love the bread basket, specifically the blue corn muffins! \n\nToday, I decided to try Sophie's Chopped Salad .. it was okay .. not bad, not great .. just okay. Nothing I would order again though. \n\nMom had the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ duck .. which she enjoyed and said was tasty. She still likes the Tiger Shrimp Tamales the best though. \n\nI opted to try the Smoked Shrimp Tacos which were delicious. Just the right amount of smokiness and just the right size for lunch. (Six nice-sized and perfectly seasoned shrimp and two tortillas.) I would have to say I will have a tough time deciding between this dish and the signature Shrimp Tamales the next time we come. \n\nFor dessert we decided to share the Sticky Toffee Pudding .. which is one of my all time favorite desserts. Unfortunately this one fell way short. It smelled right, and looked right, but the taste was not right. The pudding part was kind of dry and tasteless and the sauce was overly sweet. A disappointing end to an otherwise great lunch."

            "review": "Best piece of advice for dining at Mesa Grill: Order something non-bread related and non-carbalicious. After downing the uber amazing bread basket that is served pre-meal, you'll wish you had.\n\nFirst of all, the bread basket was the best bread basket I've ever been served. It consisted of blue corn muffins, jalapeno corn bread, blueberry coffee cake, mini scones, and the most perfectly softened butter that you ever did see. I had to try halfs of each type of bread, and they were all perfectly warm bunches of little goodness.\n\nI think the restaurant is a great brunch spot (which is the meal that we were dining here for). The menu consisted of a little bit of everything for all breakfast/lunch palettes. I chose to go with the scrambeled eggs chilaquiles for my main course. Boy, it was heavy, rich, and just superb! The flavors blended perfectly well with the eggs, the fried tortilla on the bottom, the cheese, and the creme fraiche topping. The roasted tomatillo sauce could've had a bit more heat to it, but nonetheless, it was still a great compliment to the dish.\n\nI also tried bits of my friend's dishes. The tomato soup with blue corn tortillas was actually surprisingly good (given that I'm not much of a tomato fan). The blue corn buttermilk waffle was heavenly. A bit too much creme fraiche was piled on top, but once removed, the waffle was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and just a melt in your mouth piece of heaven.\n\nThis is the second Bobby Flay restaurant I've tried (Bar Americain being the first), and he does not continue to disappoint. Really amazing food! I'd recommend this place to everyone!"

I'm not usually a sender-backer, but I made an exception here.  \n\nThe S.O. had the coffee rubbed filet mignon, which I will say was cooked perfectly.

I would give my experience a 3.5, but rounding down in rating because I don't think it deserved the full 4 stars. \nThe best part about my night was the bread basket. My friend and I shamelessly asked for another basket once we devoured through the first one. The blue corn muffins and the raisin bread was my favorite! \nAs for entree, I ordered the Chile Relleno. As a vegetarian, in terms of entrees, that was my only choice. I could have ordered 2 appetizers instead, but nothing on the appetizer menu piqued my interest. The Chile Relleno was fairly spicy and I was not expecting that at all. I wish my server had given me a little bit of a warning. Of course, there is some level of spice to be expected when ordering a stuffed chili, but the majority of the heat came from the bed of red pepper sauce. It was so spicy, I could only eat half of it. \nMy friend ordered the Queso Fundido, which was a Flay specialty, and the Chicken Skewers. She seemed to enjoy her food a lot more than I did. \n\nThe service was adequate, nothing extraordinary. My friend and I had to wait 15 minutes at the bar despite having a reservation. Once seated, our (blas\u00e9) waiter did a pretty good job explaining the signature menu items - but that was the most enthusiasm that came from him for the remainder of the night. I went for dinner on Sunday night and the place was pretty packed. \n\nPersonally, I would pass on this place since it was nothing special. But if you're a die-hard Bobby Flay fan, you may enjoy this restaurant much more than I did."

The place only had about 10 tables of customers in the large Bobby Flay owned restaurant.\n\nWe were promptly seated, then greeted by a young man who brought us breads. Three kinds to be exact, a jalapeno, a raisin loaf and roasted corn muffins. They were all okay, non blew me away. The jalapeno bread was still a bit warm which was nice. The cocktail menu had 5 signature Chef Flay inventions that all looked like liquid dreams. Seriously yummy concoctions with obvious though and effort. There was an ample wine selection, like 22 pages of vino separated into categories by grape, not region. With that many wines, I often prefer it this way. Mesa Grill is a true Tex Mex establishment, and being such they had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! Wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!  \n\nI ordered the pork sandwich and it came with a side of fries. The pork was well seasoned and juicy, the baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with the smokey heat of Ancho Chili peppers that Flay has built an empire on! Oh and the herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. So why only 3 stars? Honestly, it was A-OK, the food excellent and tasty, the service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere... That feeling you get when you know you are somewhere special.... Would I return, yes! Should you, definitely! But, maybe for dinner."

Food Network...yadda yadda yadda.  Great food at Mesa Grill.  Yes!  Amazing food at that.  First, make a reservation...even if you don't think it will be packed.  For some reason many people believe Flay is actually cooking at this restaurant, which is strange seeing that he has many restaurants around the country.  So...needless to say the restaurant is usually packed with people.  Also, the restaurant is smack dab in the middle of Caesars sports book...so do not make this meal a romantic evening.  Make this meal a meal about the good food.  I can just see myself proposing to my girlfriend \"Will you marry me?\"...with the sounds of \"Run you worthless piece of $#%@!\"...echoing behind me.\n\nBut I digress.  Onto the food.  Appetizer.  Get the tuna nachos.  It is raw tuna mixed with pico and cilantro and other spices.  These tuna pieces come with nacho chips.  I know what you are thinking....raw tuna nachos?  I swear this is perhaps the best thing in the entire restaurant...if you forget about the Shrimp Tacos, the Burgers, and desserts.  I HATE raw fish.  I HATE tuna.  I LOVE Mesa Grill's Tuna Nachos.  I don't know why that is. It is one of life's great mysteries...along with UFOs, mind control, and the JFK assasination.  \n\nAnother great selection is the shrimp tacos.  Cilantro in abundance.  I love freakin cilantro.  Even if you do not like cilantro very much you will notice how the herb enhances the taste of the shrimp.  The cilantro and spices are the star of this dish....not the shrimp.  Although the shrimp are far superior than many shrimp on the strip.  That sentence rhymed and when you begin sounding like Dr. Seuss it is time to end the review.  One other thing.  The statue of the boxer out front of Mesa Grill is actually Joe Louis.  I tried to look like a man's man in front of my fiance by saying \"Look at the Ali statue\" but had to cower in wussiness when she realized I was an idiot when it came to boxing.

The food is laden with flavor not fat. The spice is just the right amount of heat, so as not obscure the flavors. The hominy grits were creamy, textured, corny goodness with a slight hint of garlic & finish of butter. Tuna nachos were delicious. The pork tenderloin sandwich was outstanding with the most tender pork you'll ever taste, arugula, carmelized onions & homemade southwest mayo that wasn't cloying at all. Highly recommend."

We were seated quickly and our waiter greeted us very warmly! \n\nWe started off with some delicious margaritas and were given a nice little basket of mixed breads. My favorite was the blueberry coffeecake! I could really go for a lifetime supply of it. I am not a big fan of coffeecake as well. When the waiter was describing each type of bread, I kind of dismissed the coffeecake until I tried it! \n\nThe atmosphere was great. We ordered the goat cheese \"queso fundido\" as an appetizer which I highly recommend. Then we decided to order the rough cut tuna \"nachos\" and spicy scrambled eggs for our entrees. The tuna \"nachos\" are a pretty small portion and I probably wouldn't order them again. The spicy scrambled eggs had jalape\u00f1o and goat cheese apricot but it was a bit too cheesy for me. I think it's because we had the fundido for appetizer. If you love cheese, you'll be VERY happy!\n\nWe found something inedible in our potatoes and our waiter quickly took it away and replaced it. Then, the chef offered us a dessert on the house. We couldn't have been more pleased. We decided on the toasted coconut layered cake and it was AMAZING!!! We were so happy that they offered us a dessert to make up for the mistake. We ordered the best item on the menu! If you go there, be sure to have the toasted coconut layered cake. You will not regret it.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience here. I would try other items next time and thought the service was wonderful! We will definitely be back."

The spices were full of flavor in the creamy sauce. The sauce was rich, but I know that this was an appetizer meant to be shared. I ate it as an entree.\nNew Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - The pork was very tender and had a flavorful crust on the outside. I enjoyed the chewy bread and the crunch of the onions. Very well done!\nMesa Burger- The sauce on the side was very unique and tasty. I thought the fries on the side were delicious and well seasoned, but not too salty.

Dunno why, maybe the whole looking like a dork in the first Iron Chef deal vs. Morimoto thing but I had no desire to eat at his joints.\n\nThe wife suggested I try during my last trip it so I gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I went in without any expectations and came out a happy camper.\n\nEverything here as flavor. Big flavor. The caesar salad has sausage bits, the creamed cauliflower is loaded with tasty, creamy, delicious cheese, and the ribeye is served with a nice spicy sauce. The duck pancake was surprisingly good. A bit heavy on the bbq sauce but the habinero gave it a nice kick. \n\nThe ribeye was also perfectly cooked. I get annoyed these days because everyone always seems to overcook my beef but they did it just right. That being said, I don't necessarily think the cut of meat or preparation was all that great. Did that make sense? They cooked it great, the sauce was great, but it didn't seem like they started with something all that great or aged it at all so the meat wasn't as tender as I would have expected. It was really good but I've had better.\n\nI enjoyed everything and would probably take the wife here if she ever stepped foot in this land of debauchery.

Phenomenal margaritas by the way, nicely balanced and no sickeningly sweet cloying mix taste - at $12 a pop they better be good! Everything we ordered (blue corn pancake w/duck, tuna nachos, queso fundido, chile relleno, and mashed potatoes with queso sauce) was freaking delish. My personal favorite was the blue corn pancake because the duck was perfect - tender, smokey and sweet without even a hint of gamey-ness. I was also very surprised by how good the chile relleno was with it's thick hard cornmeal crust and bean/rice/mash in the middle. This was not your average deep-fried cheese stuffed pepper. \n\nAnd yes, after all that, we ordered dessert. The coconut cake is ridiculous. I mean seriously, it was so good that our waiter literally had to pry me off of it so that we would make it to our show on time. Each layer was soaked in some sort of coconut cream concoction and every bite was full of toasted coconut flakes, gooey cake and icing. I kept thinking about it all night. I'm still thinking about it! \n\nThis was definitely a luxurious treat and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else looking for a nice dinner while in Vegas."

Somehow, we ended up at Mesa, which, according to Beau, isn't Mexican, it's Tex-Mex, which is just \"spicy American food.\" \n\nUpon walking in, it sorta looks like Guy Fieri had free reign to liberally apply as many \"flame\" touches as possible - from the sconces to the ceiling, there were flames...and cowhide backed chairs, and toile backed chairs, and rainbow tea jars, and various other curious design choices throughout the restaurant. \n\nWhen seated, the waiter asked if I would like anything to drink. I said \"water, no lemon please\" and he walked off. Apparently it didn't matter if Beau wanted anything to drink, because he, by default, would get what I was getting, regardless of what he wanted. Never mind that he was the one paying.\n\nWe were given at least 5 menus between the two of us. I couldn't decide if I should have the spicy beef tenderloin tartare appetizer or the barbecued lamb cobb salad. I decided to have my second cobb salad of the day so I went with that. Beau went with the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. \n\nBeing a native Texan, and therefor quite familiar with Tex- Mex cuisine, I found it curious that a restaurant that billed itself as \"Tex-Mex\" had two semi-Tex-Mex offerings on the lunch menu: Tacos and a chile relleno. All other offerings may have the inclusion of \"New Mexican spice blend\" (whatever that is) or a green chile sauce atop American fare but that's kinda... not really Tex-Mex. \n\nOur waiter delivered us a bread basket containing the following:\n-2 slices of jalape\u00f1o French bread.\n-1 blue and yellow corn muffin. (The blue corn part had the consistency of Moon Sand and fell apart when I picked it up.)\n-2 slices of (Pepperidge Farm) raisin bread. (Yeah, I have no idea what that's about.) \n\nWhen the waiter brought out the food, he accidentally stepped on my foot and about had a heart attack, thinking I was one of those money hungry crazies that threaten to sue if so much as an eyelash is found on their napkin. It really wasn't that big of a deal and didn't even hurt. No biggie, but I guess he had no way of knowing I wasn't going to demand his termination to the manager for the gaffe. \n\nMy salad was good. Not $17 dollars good, but tasty none-the-less. The lamb was perfectly rare, just how I like it. The fris\u00e9e definitely needed to be ripped up because the pieces were huge and I looked like The Beast, from Beauty and the Beast, when he was trying to learn to use a spoon, when I was trying to wrap my mouth around my fork filled with this mini fris\u00e9e tree. Beau's hash looked like baby vomit on the plate once he deconstructed it and picked out the chicken. He left the sweet potato on the plate because he said it was too sweet. \n\nAfter spending most of the time talking about the bizarre documentaries we watch on Netflix, it was time to go. When the waiter came with the bill, I told him there was no way we were paying after he assulted me by stepping on my foot. (haha) He said if that was the case that he would need to finish the job. I like it when waiters can play along like that. Beau took care of the bill and we left. \n\nWas the food good? Yeah. But there's no way that it's worth the prices they're charging. It was nice to try but it's no where I'd be tripping over myself to go back to."

I walked in here thinking that it was all hype, but the four of us were HIGHLY impressed with all our dishes and bread basket.\n\nThe food:\nBread basket - There was a good mixture of sweet and savory breads.  I should have taken notes but some of the stand outs were the coffee cake, corn bread, and what we named the jalapeno cheese \"popper\", so basically all the breads they were offering.\n\nCrispy bacon + hash brown quesadilla (fried egg + spicy tomato salsa) - The cheese was nice and melty with the perfect crunch of bacon to go along with each bite.\n\nSpicy chicken + sweet potato hash (poached eggs + green chile hollandaise) - I just about died tasting this dish.  The sweet potato was a nice twist that was added to a normally savory eggs benedict dish.  Every bite I stole from my friend just made me melt with happiness.  So do yourself a favor and succumb to the understanding that this dish is highly recommended for a reason.\n\nBlue corn buttermilk waffle (blackberry bourbon syrup + vanilla creme fraiche) - OHHHH MY GOSH!!!!!!  I love waffles, but my god... I LOVE THESE WAFFLES.  The vanilla creme......*drool*.... just about slapped me across the face.  One bite of this waffle made me bow down in shame and made me realize that Bobby Flay is the shit!  \n\n\nMark my words, I WILL be back to try out the dinner service and hopefully that meal will be amazing and leave the same lasting impression, if not, better one than my spectacular brunch."

Also sampled was the blue corn cake with BBQ duck, which was like a southwestern interpretation of a pulled pork sandwich.  And while I love the purity of enjoying a tamale or a chile relleno at a tiny storefront or, even better, in the kitchen of a Mexican momma, the way Mesa elevates both dishes to fine dining neither cheapens or lessens these dishes.  \n\nOnly mild oddity was it seemed the majority of wines offered were French.  For some reason I assumed, considering the cuisine, to see a lot more Californian, Spanish, and Argentinean wines.  I did, however, have a sip of George's margarita.

It's a mixture of blue & yellow corn muffins,  jalapeno corn muffins, and crispy rolls dusted with cornmeal -- i just can't get enough.\n\nIt seems like with the 2012 restaurant week, everyone is yelping about dinner options so I'll write about my choice for breakfast/brunch.\n\nSPICY CHICKEN + SWEET POTATO HASH - my absolute favorite breakfast/brunch menu item here.  What a perfect combination of spicy and sweet.  Topped with some benedict style poached eggs & hollandaise sauce on top -- salty and savory.  It's a contradiction of all sorts!  But it's good.\n\nI also recommend the House Ground Hominy Grits as a side.  Mmm... Bobby knows his flavors.\n\nYes, I know.. my heart hurts from all this artery-clogging talk of eating poached eggs, spicy chicken, and grits .. but when in Vegas... go all out! Or as they might say at the tables, \"All in!\""

It didn't blow me away, but that's because the style of food isn't my favorite.\n\nThey have a great selection of wine, which is a plus. You'll be hard pressed to find a bottle under $50 though, so beware.\n\nFor appetizers, we tried the tuna nachos, which were REALLY GOOD, and the goat cheese \"queso fundido,\" which was EH. The queso didn't even taste like goat cheese and it was really oily and reminiscent of what happens when I microwave cheese at home with nachos.\n\nFor my entree, I went with their only vegetarian option--the chile relleno. It was good, but, at the end of the day, it was cornmeal-encrusted chile stuffed with cheese for $25. I guess what I'm saying is this place is really pricey for what you get.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, but the windows look right out into the sports book betting area, so it's not easy to forget you're in Vegas with a bunch of weirdos."

My salmon tasted like Cumin; and to me, cumin tastes like bad b.o. My friend's pork sandwich was just whatever...not there is out of the extrodinary besides their shrimp tamale!

            "review": "We were doing some strolling through Ceasar's Palace on New Years and, after some light shopping, started to work up a nice appetite. My boyfriend would probably challenge me on my definition of \"light\" gauging by his lack of jubilance in my shopping endeavors. But this is Ceasars Palace we're talking about here...a shopper's mecca!! Sorry, I digress... now on to the brunch.\n\nMy boyfriend has been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill NY location and he recommended we try his westcoast counterpart. Sometimes him and I depart on our culinary appraising, but in this instance are thoughts and assessments were in full-fledged alliance. \n\nThere was a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad considering it was New Year's weekend and home of culinary/restaurateur extraordinaire, Bobby Flay. I was blown away by their Saturday Brunch (which is served till 3 p.m. on Saturdays & Sundays). Mid-meal, ( I just couldn't wait till the end of brunch) I was already singing -- well, actually texting -- Mesa Grill praises to a few friends and family.\n\nI went with our server's recommendation and a Mesa Grill favorite brunch item -- the Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash. It was unforgettable! The blend of poached eggs, savory grilled chicken, sweet potato cubes, bell peppers, salsa and green chile hollandaise was staggering. Pair that with one of their savory bread basket medley items, which is divinity in a basket, and your taste buds will be working full throttle. The fresh-baked jalapeno cornbread muffins, tequila berry scones and raspberry coffee crumb cake squares were delicious! My boyfriend said the scone was the best ever! \n\nMy boyfriend orded the Lamb Cobb Salad and one of their specialty drinks, a whiskey & champagne concoction. A real rarity for my boyfriend to order a salad but I think he gravitated toward the fusion of barbequed lamb, avocado, blue cheese and bacon & buttermilk dressing. He loved it!\n\nMesa Grill is truly worth experiencing if you're in Vegas. The swanky southwestern decor and dishes are sensational.  I will sing, text, write and dance Mesa Grill praises for some time to come. Maybe one day I'll try the New York or Bahamas location :-)"

More of a cozy feel....for Vegas. \n\nService was attentive, but not intrusive, just right. Water always filled. No long wait for ordering, service, cleaning, or bill. \n\nBread basket was full of VERY moist and warm biscuits, muffins, bread. The Jalapeno muffins were a perfect little mouthful!\nWe had the Queso Fundido which was delicious, cheesy, velvety. A nice start.\n\nButtermilk waffle was flavorful, warm, with a crispy exterior. Bourbon sauce was good. I usually ask for maple syrup. But this waffle and sauce was so sweet none was needed.\n\nSpicy scrambled eggs were cooked well with a nice flavor profile, but not near spicy enough to have \"spicy\" in the name. Change the name and it is a 9. But I expected more spice from a SW type cooking.\n\nA tip I would give is to put a HOT margarita on the menu. This is SW after all.\n\nOverall we really liked Mesa, and will be back again."

My expectations were low, as most celebrity chefs' restaurants are more fluff than substance, but I was cautiously optimistic. We were pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe white peach margaritas were very refreshing and refreshingly strong, especially after not realizing our reservation was made on a fight night. Both Caesar's garage and valet were full, and we ended up having to use the self park at Mirage and walk all the way through there and the Forum Shops.\n\nShe had the blue corn pancake appetizer, and I had the cornmeal chile relleno side. The sauces drizzled over the top looked the same, and I'm still not convinced they weren't. For entrees, she had the spiced pork tenderloin, which came in three \"medallions\" that were about 2 1/2\" thick, and perfectly cooked. Mine was the fire roasted veal chop, which, while a little fatty, was very flavorful. The sage tamale was just how I wanted it to be: PACKED with sage.\n\nWe'd definitely eat there again, but I'd be more inclined to go on a weeknight when there are fewer people around, and go earlier so we wouldn't hit the pre-club crowd. Although, given what the bill came to, we might just buy the cookbook instead."

There are moments of food brilliance overshadowed by the notion that whatever is plated is great. \n\nFirst off, the good. \n\nThe prawn and corn tamales which haven't been removed from the menu since opening are wonderful. Very rich, corny, and the prawns cooked absolutely perfectly. One of the better tamales I've had whether or not you like traditional or more fusion type. The blue corn muffins were good, as was the accompanying ciabatta and cranberry breads. \n\nThe sixteen spice chicken was good and spicy. Fairly juicy as well. The accompanying tamale was very good. The side tamales all seemed to be done nicely. The steaks were decent, though not spectacular. Each was cooked exactly as ordered, not an easy feat. \n\nThe desserts were wonderful. Amongst the group, we basically got the sampler which gave us each and every dessert on the menu. They were all very good and well presented. Particularly tasty desserts were the strawberry chocolate chip shortcake, frozen peanut butter parfait, walnut flan, and coconut macadamia cake. \n\nThe service is what you would expect for the restaurant. Friendly and attentive when needed, unobtrusive when not. \n\nNow for the not so good. \n\nThe wine list was very unimpressive for a restaurant of this caliber. It was also not priced well as it was very top heavy. The quesadilla appetizers were ok. Each had the potential to be good, however the paired sauces overpowered the interiors.\n\nThe mains disappointed several of us. Each of the seafood dishes were overcooked. The orange sauce for the grouper did not go well with char. The salmon seemed to have little spice. The scallops relatively bland. The pork was also overcooked, though the person ordered it well.  \n\nI was far from impressed by the food, and I didn't even have high expectations. I admit I was stuffed, but mostly because I ate my weight in desserts. Our group did not leave hungry, just maybe yearning for something a little better from such an accomplished chef."

I was a little reluctant to try because these celebrity-chef-inspired restaurants can be a hit or miss.  I have to say that it was a excellent choice tho!\n\nWe were running late to our reservation because our show ran a little later than we thought, and so we called to inform the restaurant we would be a little late - the lady was so nice and said that it's fine.  We get seated immediately when we arrive and are greeted very promptly with the BEST server (although I forgot her name because I went here a few months ago).  Everyone in our table ordered a beverage, but one guy decided not to, but she gave him half a glass of wine just because she didn't want him to feel left out. =]  \n\nI ordered the mahi mahi but it was ok... BUT, my bf's pork tenderloin was so good it made up for it!  Our server recommended it to be cooked medium for the best outcome, and it really was perfect!  The portions are pretty generous and definitely satisfying.  After our delicious meal, we decided to splurge and order dessert.  We were all full so we decided to share one dessert among the 4 of us. We decided that our server was pretty on-point with everything we ordered, so we decided to have her choose our dessert.  She recommended the coconut cake (which none of us really looked at) but it was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Even my bf's friend who doesn't even like coconut devoured that.  \n\nExcellent service, excellent food, and excellent dessert!"

Somebody else had ordered the pork tenderloin which was amazing as well.  \n\nI had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered the baked potato loved it.

The churros tasted more burned than anything else, and the chocolate corn bread pudding was more corn than chocolate or bread pudding.\n\nWhat happened Booby Flay?

I wasn't quite sure what to expect coming here, but overall it was a decent meal at a place where you're paying extra for the star power of Mr. Bobby Flay.  All sides come separately, but is usually enough to share if you want to get a few sides to share among friends.\n\nThe decor was interesting.  Lots of  bright colors and had flames all over.  The selection of drinks had a great list of tequilas to choose from.  The cuisine is Bobby Flay's famous TexMex Style.\n\nRandom note: no hats haha, I was told to take mine off.  I know it's Vegas so don't count on a hat to hide the fact that you were too lazy to spend 5 mins on your hair just because you were up till 6 am the night before.\n\nService was decent and friendly.  They told us our table would be ready near reservation time (8:15).  Our table was not.  Haha we waited about another 30 mins.  To be fair the place was pretty packed.\n\nThe food!\nBone-In Ribeye:\nWell cooked piece of meat.  The server will tell you the house recommends Medium unless you want your steak mooing near the bone (not quite in those words).  It's a big piece of meat.  You will probably be full haha.  My friend was getting meat sweats eating the thing!  I didn't feel that the random toppings and sauces that gave it the TexMex theme were necessary.\n\nTuna \"Nachos\":\nAppetizer dish.  Blue corn and Potato? Chips to handle what was basically some rough cut tuna tartar.  The tuna had some mango habanero sauce on the plate that was quite good.  The tuna itself was good, but seemed a bit bland to me.  The potato chip was flaky and seemed to be created by pressing multiple layers together.\n\nSpinach:\nSide dish.  Pretty standard sauteed spinach.\n\nGarlic Tamale:\nSmall Tamale with a big pat of garlic butter in the center.  Again, good, but not amazing.  Also I was getting so full from the steak it was hard to finish off the tamale.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad place, but with the gluttony of food in Vegas, I think you can probably do better.  Especially if all you're looking for is a good steak."

I dragged my husband away from our excellent accomodations at Encore to go to Ceasars just for Mesa Grill...the result...huge disappointment:( \n\nI agree with another Yelper when she said \"The wait, service, meal, the whole experience all fell short of expectations.\" \n\nThe host greeted us by staring at a computer screen, no eye contact, or smile on his face. The servers and bus boys don't get out of your way as you're walking to your table or to the restroom...instead they prioritize their walk, almost bumping into me a few times!\n\nI was so extremely bummed to find that the restaurant only offers a brunch menu on Sunday at 1:30pm, as we were expecting the full choices for lunch. They advertise the lunch menu outside, and it's not until you're already seated that you find brunch is your only option. There were hardly any choices at all!\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers, and for entrees the burger and the spice chicken salad. All the food was bland. I've honestly had better burgers at the Burger Lounge chain in LA, or dare I say even at an Applebees or Chilis restaurant. Seriously! WTF?!\n\nBland, bland, bland.\n\nThere wasn't 1 thing I would care to taste again. \n\nMy advice: spend your $75 for a lunch for 2 elsewhere.\n\nBobby...you have broken my heart! :( Please redeem yourself with some changes to your restaurant. I know you can do so much better."

You're basically paying for the name instead of quality food.  Basic cocktails are $12+.  Desserts are $11 and not big enough to share (no I'm not a pig either).  \n\nI ordered the pork tenderloin which was $36 for 3 tiny pieces (c'mon, it's not sushi!) and a very dry tasteless \"tamale\".  My dad and my wife had the turkey dinner for $38, again very small portions and they later told me it was cold!  My 12 year old son had the salmon which he really enjoyed, but for $32 can't you at least include 1 side??!!\n\nThe best thing I can say about the restaurant is the bread basket!  The waiter warned us of the \"spicy\" bread which was not spicy at all - just a couple bits of jalapeno, but the cheese crust was delicious.\n\nThe service was ok, but nothing special.  It took forever to get our food (we were there for 2 hours), but I can understand that due to the holiday.

Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!\n\nSo after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.\n\nTiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.\n\nBlue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  \n\nSmoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.\n\nGrouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.\n\nWe passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  \n\nEyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.\nNose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!\nEar ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!\nMouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!\nTummy ~ Very well satisfied!"

The waitress was outstanding.  \n\nNow the food.\nThey brought a basket of bread and let me tell you I was in heaven.  There was a raisin nut bread, a jalapeno bread and corn muffins.  They were so good we asked for another basket and finished it. \n\nMy husband and I had margaritas, me peach, him the special agave nectar one.  They were good.\n\nWe had the TIGER SHRIMP+ ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE which was fine.  I didn't like the tamale much but the shrimp and sauce were wonderful.  Next I had the GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS which were out of this world good.  I ate all of them save for the bites I gave around the table and it was a big portion...the tamale that came with it \"meh\" not so good but who had room for it.  My husband had the MANGO + SPICE CRUSTED TUNA STEAK and it was delicious too, not as good as my lamb but still really good.  Our friend had the black bean soup - which was delicious and he also had the taco dish which I can't find on their online menu but he didn't think much of it.  Our other friend had the chicken dish which is also not on the online menu and it was ok...it was chicken.  \n\nWe finished dinner off with the TOASTED COCONUT LAYER CAKE and it was so good I am now ruined for all coconut cake.  It had a coconut cream over the top of it and the layers were moist with I think a simple syrup.  It was so good.\n\nI want to go again as soon as possible."

It was really overstaffed as there was at least twice as many service people as there were customers. \n\n-I ordered Ancho Chile Crusted Sea scallops on salad ($22) and husband had swordfish sandwich ($16). Both of our dishes were just ok. The sea scallops were undercooked and salad under it was just ok. Swordfish steak was thin and couldn't really taste any fish with all the other flavors going on with the club. \n-Our entrees were a 3* but I added 1* because the sides are the highlights: They serve a really nice selection of complimentary breads, chef gave us some butter pickles that there were totally mouth-watering. Southwestern fries that came with the swordfish club is so tasty. Fries are very crispy, not too thick and well-seasoned. Not too many places do fries to my liking. They also make excellent margaritas so that's a must. \n\nLunch prices are decent for the strip ranging from $15-$25 / entree."

BUT I WILL make an exception for this restaurant. Hopefully that speaks volumes. \n\nThis restaurant (owned by Bobby Flay) is located on the casino floor of Caesar's Palace. It's easy to miss unless you're really looking for it. I feel like this restaurant is underrated and can be easily overshadowed by the many restaurants that Caesar's Palace offers. \n\nOne of the main reasons why I come here is the breakfast/brunch menu. I seriously cannot get enough of their Smoked Salmon and Dill Quesadilla. It has the perfect amount of smoked salmon and cheese and the creme fraiche is delicious. Their Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is fantastic as well as their Wild Striped Bass and Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. I would definitely like to try the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles (a somewhat new discovery from my Mexican friends) and the Spicy Scrambled Eggs. As if you couldn't already tell I'm a sucker for spicy foods...as well as smoked salmon. I was also told that the Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle is to die for as well. \n\nI honestly haven't had anything that doesn't taste good at this restaurant. The service is prompt and attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. I haven't had a complaint yet. Try this place out and you won't be disappointed! Good job, Bobby Flay!"

We ordered the mushroom quesadilla (that is topped with a perfectly fried egg), the grilled mahi mahi with risotto, and the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with tamale.  Everything was so good!  \n\nThe service was ok.  Our server was not very enthusiastic and didn't seem like she ever tasted the food herself when i asked her questions about the menu.  \n\nThe bread basket was cool because it comes with 3 different types - a jalape\u00f1o cheese sliced bread, a sweet raisin sliced bread, and a corn muffin.  My least favorite was the corn muffin because it was really dry, cold, and crumbly.  I would skip it.  \n\nMy boyfriend agrees that the food tastes awesome, but that the portions are too small.  He was still hungry after the mahi mahi, and said he could probably eat another one.  I thought the portion size was right for a balanced meal.  I ate my entire plate!\n\nOverall, tasty hot entrees and appetizer.  I would come back again!"

So walking around Ceasar's Palace we thought it would be cool to eat at the Mesa Grill.  It was around brunch time.  We were waiting to be seated but the waitress was on the phone.  So we waited.  After about two minutes she hangs up to tell us that they are closing to get ready for dinner.  So we could not be sitted but come another time.  We couldn't believe the rudeness of the girl.  I would of been totally cool if she just told us they were closed in the beginning instead of having us wait for her to get off the phone and her tone be like \"her shit don't stink\".  Stuck up hostesses are the worst.  Uggg!\nBeing the gluttons of punishment we are, we decide to go again the next day again around lunch time.  I should know by now to never give places a second chance but oh well.  Again there is a \"my shit don't stink\" hostess.  Are they trained to act this way?  It is a hot day so I have been wearing a ballcap around town.  They ask me to take off my hat or sit at the bar.  I pause and decide just go with the flow.  I am on vacation.  No need to ruffle any feathers even though my feathers are a little ruffled.  So I take my ballcap off.\nWe decide to order some drinks and appetizers.  The drinks and appetizers were real good.  Bobby definitely gets a star for each.\nWe also ordered lunch.  My wife a salad and a burger for myself.  My wife's salad is okay.  My wife said that it was something she could make herself.  Nothing spectacular.  My burger was okay too.  Way too much bread for a bun.  Even the waiter said that a lot of people say the same thing.  The meat was also not that flavorful.  I have had better.  We should of stayed with drinks and appetizers.\nOverall experience was a let down.  The hostesses suck ass and need to do a better job.  Seriously, you want that to be the first impression of your business.  The drinks and appetizers were good.  The salad was okay.  The burger was okay.  Not what I expected from a restaurant with Bobby Flays name on it.  Defiinitely plenty room for improvement."

It's filled with jalape\u00f1o sourdough, cornbread muffins, and raisin bread. Many of the appetizers looked good, but after seeing the portions of other entr\u00e9es coming out, my husband and I thought we would try to save any extra room we had for dessert instead. \n\nThe last time I came here, I ordered the cornmeal encrusted chili relleno, and though it was excellent (and the prettiest chili relleno I ever saw on a plate), I wanted to try something new this time. I opted for the mango spice encrusted tuna steak served on a bed of couscous with mango chunks and pine nuts. Holy deliciousness, Batman! The flavors of this dish just explode in your mouth!\n\nMy husband ordered a veal chop, which was equivalent to the size of his head. No joke... check the pictures I posted. It came with a side of blue cheese smashed tamale, which was both interesting and tasty.\n\nWhat little room we saved for dessert, we decided to go with something seasonal... pumpkin! So we ordered a pumpkin tartlet topped with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream and a dulce de leche sauce. We were both happy we saved room for that. :)\n\nI would not hesitate to come here a third time after two wonderful dining experiences. Thanks, Bobby!"

Bobby Flay is known for big bold flavors.  It sounds cliche - but it's more than hype.  The first thing that stood out was the bread offerings before the meal. This isn't your standard loaf of bread and butter - there are some truly delectable and spicy treats in that bread basket.\n\nFinally I ordered my meal - a chicken and sweet potato hash with a green chili hollandaise.  Honestly one of the best breakfast meals I've ever eaten, and I love breakfast food.  Such a wonderful meld of sweet, spicy and savory - I've tried with varying degrees of success to replicate it in my kitchen, but I can't recommend this dish enough!\n\nI will be back!"

I remember loving the jalepeno bread because it was different, but really it was kind of crappy bread. Bobby, we love you but stop baking - it's not your style. Tortilla's, chips, or maybe some other SW app would've fit. \n\nTuna nacho's were ok; the oil trio's at the base for garnish were really REALLY good...

            "review": "Mesa Grill is Bobby Flay's restaurant in the lobby of Caesar's Palace.  Across from the Sports Book, the restaurant tries to make you forget that you are in Vegas.  As long as you are not facing the outside, this is relatively successful (if you are facing the outside, forget it, because the windows are to the casino).  The restaurant is very attractive - the d\u00e9cor is understated and the white tablecloths give a fine dining flair.  The service is a good - friendly but harried (each server has too many tables).  The food is divine.  We had:\nBaby Romaine Salad ($14): leaves of baby romaine are dressed in roasted garlic dressing and tossed with hominy croutons, rounds of chorizo and crumbled cotija cheese. This is an amazing salad. Each leaf is dressed with the slightly nutty dressing that is not overpowering. The crunchy little cubes of hominy polenta are creamy and surprising. The chorizo is like smoky thick cut pepperoni. Yum!\nSweet Potato Clam Chowder ($14): a soup bowl of smoky sweet potato cream soup with little tiny cubes of sweet potato and bacon as well as chopped clams that has a distinct but not bitter chile flavor and is topped with two clams in the shell. Another outstanding dish! This is one of the best soups that I have ever had. Sweet, smoky and spicy with lots of textural elements.\nAncho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon ($25): a spicy black bean sauce with a dollop of a mild roasted jalapeno crema with a drizzle of ancho chile sauce is topped with a pile of saut\u00e9ed spinach and one of the finest pieces of salmon that I have had glazed in honey with chili powder and topped with minced tomatillos and scallions. Homerun! The salmon was cooked to our request - crunchy exterior with fleshy interior that is my kind of rare. The sweet and spicy glaze, the earthy black bean sauce and the smoky chile sauce are a delight to the tastebuds. One of the best pieces of salmon that I have ever had.\nAre we going to have dessert? Let's look...OMG.  Carrot Cake Ice Cream Sandwich ($12): two crunchy spice cookies with lots of shredded carrot sandwich 1\" thick slab of cream cheese ice cream and are surrounded by dulce de leche sauce and crumbled pralines and are topped with little cubes of roasted pineapple. Bobby Flay does it again. The ice cream tastes like the best cream cheese frosting ever, but lighter and cold. The cookies are reminiscent of my mom's carrot cake, and the sweet and nutty roasted pineapple cubes bring the whole dish home.\nI have been a fan of Bobby Flay's for a long time, and this was my first time dining in one of his restaurants. I love that the real experience lived up to my expectations. I highly recommend it."

I don't blame them.  The food is consistently good and the service is great.  The servers are professionals and super knowledgeable.  I like the open kitchen where you get see them grilling your meat! \nI like to get a specialty cocktail before the meal and have a glass of wine with dinner.  I got the strawberry fields this time.  It was good, but I think I will stick to the peach margarita.   We always start with the shrimp and corn tamales.  I feel like that is the must have dish on the menu.  It's so good. I asked the server to pick out a glass of white wine for me and he picked exactly what I was looking for.  \nFor my entree this time I had the lamb.  It was tasty and cooked nicely.  The portion size is pretty much double than what I could eat.  I took the other piece of lamb home and actually ate it a few hours later!    I had the squash blossoms as a side which i think i might have let sit on the table too long before eating.   Dessert was ok...Churros with dark chocolate dipping sauce for dessert."

            "review": "First of all, let me just say that I love Bobby Flay. This was a surprise visit from bf after I had said that I love Bobby. We wound up getting there pretty late (right around 10:30pm when their last seating is at 10:30). Even though we got there late, the hostesses were nice and sat us right away since we had a reservation.\n\nOur server was an incredibly nice lady who was very attentive to our needs. She recommended a framboise beer for me since I was trying to decide what kind of drink to get. It wound up being pretty good. Bf ordered a Belgian White beer, forget what kind, and it was also pretty good. \n\nOkay... food. Yum. We decided to go with a couple appetizers and an entree to do family style, since we wanted to try a lot of different things. Here are my thoughts: \n\n-Roasted Corn Soup: omg this was amah-zing. It had a very complex taste, starting a bit on the sweet side, going to savory side, then ending with a somewhat sweet aftertaste. It was amazing. \n-Rough Cut Tuna Nachos: this was probably one of the few factors bringing it down to a 4 star versus 5 star. Fresh ahi, garnished with an avocado and mango glaze, what I think is homemade tortilla chips, it was good, don't get me wrong. It was pretty ordinary though, although bf loved the mango glaze. \n-Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: grilled shrimp in some kinda creamy delicious sauce (I think it's creme fraiche, but not sure), with an incredibly yummy corn tamale. This was amazing. My only suggestion would be to add more shrimp. By the end of the dish we were out of shrimp but still had a substantial amount of tamale. \n-Entree: New Mexico Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin: This was so yummy. Three perfectly portioned pieces of the perfect amount of pink, tender pieces (guess that's why they call it TENDERloin). But.. while the meat was deliciously cooked, the sauce and the rub were a bit overwhelming, particularly the rub. \n\nOverall, this was a great experience. I love Bobby and I think it was a great experience to visit his restaurant. I'm sad I couldn't give it five stars, but I save five stars for restaurants where I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it, and due to the tuna nachos being somewhat mediocre and the tenderloin rub being too strong, I got to take the star away. I'd give it a five if Bobby were there though. ;) Would definitely come again."

I can appreciate Bobby Flay's style and influences.\n\nWent for brunch on a Saturday morning.  Started out the right way with a bloody mary which was really good, although I would have preferred a touch less, just a touch less horseradish.  Next time I'll probably get a \"rita\" although I wouldn't mind if I had another bloody mary.  Took a few minutes to get seated but we didn't have reservations so can't complain too much.\n\nI had the ranch style eggs on a tostada and ancho chile sauce....really delicious.  I was going to get the Spicy Chicken with sweet potato hash, but I wanted something more simple.  It was a much larger portion that I had planned and I almost didn't finish, but I couldn't leave any on my plate, that would have been wrong and not in the true \"food cripple\" style.  Maybe I wouldn't have been so stuffed if I hadn't been devouring the treats in the bread basket.  I won't reiterate what was said by Lindley K., except for...damn that stuff was good.  Read that post about the bread.\n\nMy girlfriend had the crab cakes for an entree and was very content.  Sat near the kitchen and could see what the cooks were placing up in the window, and yes, the burger looked really good.  Might have to try that next time.  \n\nThe waiter was attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable.  \n\nIf staying at Caesar's, you need to eat here, and you need to consider it if you are staying somewhere else."

I was in a good mood.\n\nThen the food: a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy, hearty, and pretty, in particular,  the corn & shrimp tamale -- outstanding!  \n\nIn other words, next time in Vegas, I do intend to give up  -- nay, enjoy! -- a valuable Saturday Dinnertime there."

I sat at the bar and was greeted by a very friendly bartender.  After a horrible meal at Red, White & Blue in the Mandalay Bay the day before, I was hoping for something better and was in the mood for a burger.  There were two on Mesa Grill's menu, a standard one and one that was a cuban style burger.  I asked the bartender which was better.  He said he thought both are good but suggested I try the cuban style one for a change of pace.\n\nThe burger came on a rectangular glass plate with a side of fries and an aioli.  I liked how the bun was toasted and firm, not soggy.  The beef was very juicy and cooked medium rare.  There was ham in burger.  While it was tasty, I could have done without it, as I think meat upon meat is a bit much.  The fries were crisp and well-seasoned.  For $16 it's not a bargain but after tasting the horrible, but same priced burger at Red, White & Blue, I thought the one at Mesa Grill was worth it.  The only thing I thought was a bit pricey was my lemonade, which was $4.  It was good, but not $4 good.  Nevertheless, I'll definitely go back to Mesa Grill try the other items on the menu."

I don't think I'm quite as blown away by Flay's dishes as people in 1990's New York City must have been, just because I've been eating the stuff he bases his ideas on my whole life.\n\nThat being said, this is probably the best steak I've ever had so far.  Even aside from his awesome spice rub, my filet mignon was so tender that I quite literally could have cut it with my fork (not that I would in a place like this).  The twice-baked potato that I ordered as a side was excellent as well, but the sauteed spinach was a little plain.  Maybe it'd have been a little better with some vinegar or something, but it wasn't bad by any stretch, just a little plain in contrast to everything else.\n\nThe other people I was with had the NY Steak, the veal, and the lamb.\nThe NY Steak was a little more traditional; seasoned only with salt and pepper, unlike most of the dishes.  Very juicy and tender.  I don't remember too many specifics about the veal and lamb except that they were both excellent as well, and came with tamales as a side.  I'd say the tamales were about on par with what you'd usually get from your Mexican buddy's mom; which is to say, very good.\n\nThe sommelier was very helpful in selecting a bottle of wine and did not mind in the bit when I sheepishly admitted that one of our stipulations was \"sub-$80 please.\"  He recommended an excellent, bold syrah that paired well with all four dishes.  Our waitress was also helpful in choosing a tequila to enjoy neat as an after-dinner drink.\n\nAfter tax and 30% tip, the bill came to about $350; about what we were expecting and certainly reasonable for a meal and wine of this caliber for four.\n\nWe only had enough money in our vacation budget for one fancy dinner all dolled up in our best clothes, and this did nicely."

Christine the bartender is AWESOME and made the best recommendations for us. Started our meal off with a house Margarita on the rocks with salt. Made up of Hurradurra Tequila, fresh squeezed lime, and agave syrup it was so good. Nickole had a White Peach Margarita and that was amazing as well. \nFor an appetizer we had the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, wow. Honestly the best thing I have ever eaten. With garlic corn, and a cilantro sauce that makes you want to cry... this Tamale was sculpted by gods, i swear. I could eat this dish every day.\nDrink #2 Pear Margarita. YUM Not too sweet but with a slight hint of pear. Very good... and strong!\nFor the entrees we both split the Smoked Shrimp Tacos and Ancho Chili Honey Glazed Salmon. wow x2. The Tacos were perfection. With grilled corn tortillas and a cabbage slaw the shrimp being so juicy and perfectly marinated this dish was to die for. The Salmon was perfect too. Cooked at a medium temp and on a bed of a house made black bean sauce and a cilantro oil the honey glaze complemented the salmon perfectly. Both amazing choices. \nDrink #3 Pomegranate Martini a little on the strong side but pretty good\nDesert- Sticky Toffee cake. Being gluten free I only had a small bite to try it and If my allergy was mild and wouldn't cause me severe pain i would have eaten the whole thing. wow was it good! and with a side of house made ice cream it was truly the cherry on top to our meal. \nI highly recommend this place to everyone. It will not disappoint! I cant wait to come back"

It's LONG been on my bucket list and now I was going to finally see what the hype was all about.\n\nWe sat at the bar which was great as the bartenders were extremely friendly and chatted with us the whole time.  It's our feeling that we could get a table with a server that only wants to take our order and drop off food and who might snicker at you if you are trying to split share an entree, OR you can sit at the bar with a bartender that doesn't care what you order to eat and they'll chat with you all day.  It's an easy decision ;)\n\nWe ordered the Mesa Burger (9/10) and the Tuna Nachos (10/10) and the Southwestern Salad (9/10).  All were excellent.  We washed it all down with the Mesa Grill Margarita and boy what a nice send-off out of Vegas!\n\nCan't wait to come back and try some of the more \"fringe\" entrees ;)"

I also tried the rabbit and lobster tacos, which were both nice too. \n\nReally nice service and a fun environment in the heart of Ceasar's Palace.

Our server was really friendly and attentive.\nOn to the food. They give you 4 kinds of bread, my faves were the corn muffin and the sweet one (I think there's cranberry in it). We ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich with the fries and the tiger shrimp tamale. Both of them are amazing! Bobby takes the tamales to another level. It's so tasty! The meat on the sandwich are just superb! My boyfriend does not usually eat sandwich, but he loves it!! The size is pretty huge.\nOh and I order the cactus pear iced tea (they have the margarita version, but I don't like alcohol). It's good also!!\nThis place is amazing!"

Overall the food was decent but nothing really amazing, although the tamale that came with the meal was out of this world.  But to have something like a tamale be the thing that I remember the most is a bit disappointing.  While the pork tenderloin was good, it wasn't super special, or at least to me it wasn't.  Maybe because I am not a huge fan of pork in general but I expected more from it because of all the reviews about how amazing it was.  The filet was decent as well but not too memorable either.  Overall if you have the money to spend this place is worth a shot, you make enjoy it better than I did."

For some reason something is keeping me from giving this place five stars though but I can't quite put my finger on it. I've never had a bad experience here but I've also never had an amazing experience here either. But definitely good, consistent ,flavorful food. \nYou can't go wrong with the queso for an appetizer. I came here before with a party of four and I think we actually had 2 orders for 4 people and we were able to finish it. The food here is all very intense and unique in flavor, maybe more than I'm used to. Don't come here expecting traditional Mexican food- you will be disappointed. Just come here expecting a lot of flavor. \nThis restaurant is always busy and one of the harder places to get a reservation in Vegas. The service is okay here, nothing spectacular, more on par with a semi-casual restaurant than fine dining. \nI always find myself watching the cooks in the kitchen. They always seem to be hustling so I gotta give them props for that. Definitely a place I would recommend trying."

            "review": "I went on Friday night with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. The comments below are either my thoughts on what I ordered or their thoughts almost verbatim (we discussed my writing a review over drinks after we left)\n\nHouse margaritas: Extremely heavy on the lime, to the extent that the tequila is lost and it ends up tasting like a key lime martini\n\nBlue corn pancake with duck: had potential, but it was over sauced to the point that the duck was lost. The pancake was more of a crepe, and it was overpowered as well. All you could taste was the sauce.\n\nCornmeal crusted chile relleno entree: The chile relleno was good and cheesy. The crispy crust was unique, but it didnt necessarily add to the dish.\n\n22 oz bone in rib eye: I ordered this medium rare. It came on the blue side of rare throughout and burned to a crisp on the outside. The chipotle glaze was completely lost and instead it tasted like a briquette. I was especially disappointed in this rib eye because a) I can cook a steak better than that and b) It's Flay's restaurant; you don't screw up grilled meat.\n\nSide dish of chile relleno filled with black beans and rice. Good, but not great. The grainy cornmeal crust took away from an otherwise excellent stuffed chile (the person who ordered this is different than the person who ordered it as an entree)\n\nSixteen spice chicken: No complaints from the person who ordered it. She seemed pleased but not overjoyed and appreciated the large portion.\n\nOverall, none of us felt that Mesa Grill met expectations. Two of us gave it a 2 star review, the third would give it a 3 star review. If you want to go to a celebrity chef restaurant in Vegas, I would recommend Batali's place. A lunch I had there 2 years ago still haunts me in my dreams."

For drinks, we could not resist Bobby's margarita selection, which has it's own menu. I had the Cactus Pear, the lady had the Peach. Mine was good, but the peach was way better. I switched for my 2nd drink!\n\nI started with the Corn soup as an app which was fantastic. For entrees, I had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops served in a tangerine roasted jalapeno mint sauce. Served with a plantain tamale with molasses butter. The fiancee had the blue corn crusted halibut with salsa cruda, served with sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, Nicoise olives, basil & oregano. Both dishes were as delicious as they sound, cooked to perfection, and served not a minute too soon. My chops were cooked to a perfect medium, bursting with a juicy deliciousness that was both expected and unexpected all at the same time. A+. Her halibut was equally as good, many notes of incredible flavor all on one plate. Bobby's the man!\n\nPortions were adequate, good enough for us to skip dessert and feel perfectly full.

I was the only one in our party that knew who Bobby Flay was.  I consider myself a foodie but the others not so much. The dinner menu was somewhat limited but to be expected if the food is done well. All en tree's were $35-$48 with the sides about $8 each (yeah, entree' does not come with sides.) OK, paying for a big name but not super expensive a la Robuchon. I wanted to try several different tastes from the menu so I ordered 3 appetizers at about $15-$18 each.  The bbq duck on blue corn cake was fantastic in a really sweet bbq way, however it was more like a tapa in that it was tiny and not enough to share a taste with my companions.  All the appetizers were really, really tiny - tapas style.  The mushroom quesedilla was unremarkable and so salty, I had to send it back.  I love salt so for me to send back a salty dish, it has to be nearly inedible. I have no idea how this could have happened. My companions had the salmon and she felt underwhelmed with the dish. The other had the rough cut tuna nachos which was basically like Hawaiian poke' served with a side of chips...tasted this and nothing remarkable in any way.  The bread was fantastic and interesting. The sauces were good.  The staff was attentive and professional. I left hungry and annoyed that I payed so much for unimpressive food. I think my companions were a bit annoyed with me for forcing them to go to Mesa.  Apparently, some folks here have had a good experience so maybe my expectations were too high.  Given this, I highly recommend having lunch or brunch here first as the prices are more reasonable."

We waited 15 minutes while several walk ins were sat before us. The host was rude when our table was ready and acted like he didn't want us threre. The server had no personality and made us feel like it was an inconvenience for him to have to answer our questions about the menu. We waited an hour to get our food while people who were sat after us got there food. We ended up leaving because we felt that this staff really didn't want to serve us. Walking out there was no apology at all and a group of the wait staff had gathered around to giggle at chat amongst each other. The  host who had originally sat us didn't question why we were leaving and didn't show any concern for our dissatisfaction. We just asked to pay for our beverages he said our waiter would bring us the bill. The waiter brought the ticket again with no apology and told us that well done takes a long time to cook. Not even the manager came to check on why we were leaving which really solidified our fellings of being mistreated. I'm so bummed because I look up to Bobby and really wanted this experience to be amazing, rather it's put a terrible taste in my mouth about who he has representing him.

The attention to detail that you expect at a restaurant of this quality was not present. The waiters served the food without explanation or description. The Mojito was a cheap sweet and sour mix unlike the fresh Mojito previously served there with the hand smashed mint leaves. But despite all of that the quality of the food was not good. And I say this because I was eating the same dish (Yucatan Chicken Tacos). Unlike before there was little flavor or taste. I could have gotten a better meal from an L.A. gourmet food truck. \n\nIt appears that other people are running the establishment under his name or with the current state of the economy the Casino is putting the heat on them to cut corners.

The waiter was quick and attentive (being that we were there for lunch during the week and the restaurant was maybe 20% full, this is expected) and also knew everything about every dish.  I also had probably the best Margarita of my life (on the rocks of course) as my aperitif and the waiter was even able to tell me exactly how it was made without asking the bartender (I could not reproduce this at home, although I have come close).\n\nThe food was perfect and for the quality was very reasonably priced.

There were a fair number of people waiting, but we had reservations (party of 7) and our wait was less than 10 minutes.\n\nOur server was fairly prompt to the table to take appetizer orders, but I had to tell him we needed a drink menu and the wine list first (sorry, this is something that should be noticed by a server). The wine list was decent, but nothing exceptional. Prices ranged from 2.0x - 3.0x retail. We opted to do two bottles: one was a Joel Gott Zinfandel and the other was a central coast Syrah that carries the restaurant's private label. Both were about $60 each. The Zin was lovely, with a deep color, soft tannins, and all the mouthfeel you'd expect from a nice zinfandel. The syrah had nice flavor, but was a tad tight on its own. I figured it would shine with some of the meat dishes and it did pair very well with the entrees.\n\nNoise levels in the dining area were pretty loud, but it was also a Friday night in Vegas and the place was busy. As for the service after we ordered, well it can be summed up with one word: s-l-o-w. Our apps took a while to appear and the entrees took even longer after that. Close to 30 mins between app plates being removed and entree plates being brought. The server really wasn't checking in very often either and was pretty much invisible after our entrees came.\n\nThe menu is all about showcasing Bobby's flair for all things southwestern and you won't find much that doesn't have at least some corn, chile, salsa, and/or spice. Appetizers were all in the $10 - 16 range and entrees started at about $30 with most meat dishes over $40. Sides are separate (of course) and they're $8 a pop. We ordered a lot of food for seven people, so I will only get into the highlights and lowlights of the dinner:\n\nMenu Highlights\n\n    * Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla - This was by far the best thing on the appetizer menu (and arguably on the whole menu). It is served up with grilled green onions, artichokes and a smoky salsa. A fried egg adorns the top of the totrilla to complete the package. This was awesome. The flavors all work together and the chorizo had nice bite without overpowering the dish.\n    * Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon - This was a nice sized filet, cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare. It came with a mushroom reduction sauced spiked with ancho chile. It was very tasty and the coffee rub added a nice nuance to the dish. The person eating it was kind enough to share some of it with us. I knew by the size of the smile on his face that it was a winner before I even tried any of it.\n    * Roasted Corn - Yes, this is a side dish, but it ranks as one of the better options on the menu. The corn kernels were crisp-tender and then tossed with cactus & lime. Some cotija cheese is sprinkled on top for good measure, too. Very tasty and worth the $8 for a bowl. \n\nMenu Lowlights\n\n    * Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Tamale - I figured this dish was a no-brainer in this restaurant, maybe that's why it was such a huge disappointment. The shrimp were a nice size, but overcooked and the textured of the tamale itself seemed way too dry. This went mostly uneaten. \n    * Green Chile Ciopinno - Flay is known for award winning ciopinno, but let's say that this was not the finest example. Most of the seafood was overcooked, which was such a downer because the green chile broth was amazing (I'd order a bowl of the broth by itself if I could).\n    * Salmon with Ancho-Honey Glaze - This was a nice sized piece of salmon and, as opposed to the other seafood dishes, it was cooked perfectly. It was served with a spicy black bean sauce and a jalapeno crema. It all sounded like it would go well together, but it really amounted to just too much going on. On top of that, it was extremely salty. It all added up to a dish I wanted to forget about after a few bites. \n\nFinal Take \n\nMesa Grill was kind of a mixed bag for us. It did some things really well, but there were a lot of things that were 'meh', too. When you're talking about a place that was $100+ per person, I expect a bit more in the food and service department. If I had to do it over, I'd probably stick with having a drink and an app at the bar, then go get dinner elsewhere. My apologies to Bobby, but this is one throwdown that he lost because this foodie feels you can do far better on the Strip at this price point.\n\nOverall Grade = C+ (Average)\n\nThe EV Foodie"

Got great seats for me and wifey at Celine concert (which in it's own right is legendary), stopped by busy Mesa Grill asked if they had anything after the concert and a very nice guy said we'll have a spot for you when you come out.    Exit concert enter Mesa Grill.  We've been to MG and it was great the first time... BUT you know about 2nd times right?  Well this put up an awesome repeat performance. They did have a sign saying they were closing early that night?  Was Mr. Flay making an entrance tonight?  Was that why everything was polished perfect?  I really could care less, everything was perfect and that's all that matters (after our lovely Olives evening - this was refreshing). \n\nPatrido Margharita - awesome, strong, no syrups\nTiger Shrimp Tamale -  Perfect, no other words\nCoffee Filet - perfect spice, perfectly cooked.... ummmm Perfect\nChile Crusted Pork Tenderloin -  another P for AWESOME\nCrushed Blueberry Tart - surprisingly light, very tastey great ending \n\nThe fact that the last 2x i've been there have put consistantly great dishes makes me give 5 stars.  For those that think i have a mancrush on BF, you got that wrong.  Every time I see him on a television show I want to throw something at the TV..... I turn it off and walk away instead.  The Mesa Grill though was spot on that night."

Is that blood dripping down my chin?\n\nI love Bobby Flay.  I have naughty, naughty dreams about the man that simply are not discussed in any detail outside my therapist's office.  Though my suggestion to The Bud that we consider making reservations there came off as totally casual, devil-may-care, my insides were screaming, \"Please, if you love me, you will take me here!\"\n\nWe only visited once this trip, but it was our third visit to the restaurant, and it was completely perfect in every way.  Atmosphere is fiery, service attentive, food is creative, and unique.  The white peach margarita was delicious and boozy.  The sweet potato soup was beautifully spiced.  The NY strip steak was perfectly medium rare.  And huge.  And served with a house made steak sauce that made me whimper a little.  As mentioned above, I had to take half of it with me to be, um, devoured later, in the dark.  What?  Shut up.  Just go here already.  And if you see Bobby Flay, do me a favor and don't tell me.  I couldn't handle it."

My \nboyfriend really wanted to go because he said that a friend told him that the burgers were amazing. I'm not a fan of burgers but I did find items on the menu that I would enjoy. We walked in for Saturday Brunch and had an amazing server. She was very sweet and informative. We decided to order the salmon and tuna tartares for an appetizer. It was incredible. The flavors worked perfect together and had just a little bit of spice. \n\nFor entrees, my boyfriend ordered the buffalo burger with South-West\nfrench fries and I ordered the bacon and hash brown quesadilla that \ncame with an egg and salsa on top. He enjoyed his burger and I loved\nmy entree. I don't have any complaints. Anything that combines bacon,\nhash browns, and eggs is wonderful to me. \n\nI would also recommend ordering a Cactus Pear Margarita. I've never\nhad anything like it before. I also wanted to try the Peach Margarita, but\ndidn't want to spend the extra money. The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side but that's to be expected of a restaurant owned by one of \nthe Food Network's most popular chefs. \n\nI would def go back next time I'm in Vegas."

The tuna was perfectly seared, and all of the flavors worked really well.\n\nI also ordered a pear and cactus margarita after watching the bar keep make one, and a vodka press, cuz that's what I drink.  I was surprised at how well the margarita tasted since I don't normally do tequila. I know, how ironic. And the vodka press is pretty hard to make not taste good.  \n\nI did have to make reservations, but the wait wasn't very long so I was fine with that.  And I was given the option to sit at the bar or lounge for a full menu if something opened up before my rsvp time.  So I sat at the bar.  The bartender was pretty cool, and the food came out pretty quick which was surprising considering how packed the place was.  \n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this restaurant to everyone who likes to eat good tasting food, and drink drinks made just right.  The prices are a little high, but then again, it's pretty much the going rate for a quality eatery in this godforsaken town.  Also, I hear Bobby Flay likes to go in on occasion to help out the pastry chef.  Chances are you likely won't see him there, but I hear this place is a gambling town so you never know..."

The food is pricey but you're in Vegas and in Bobby Flay's territory. The blue corn duck appetizer was tiny and okay. The duck seemed a bit dry but the sauce was good. My lamb entree was AHMAAZINGGG. Super tender- they recommended medium which I got. Two of my friends got the filet and I got 2 completely different reactions. One exclaimed it was the greatest steak of their life (they got it rare) and the other said they wish they had gotten something else (they got it med-rare). Not sure what to make of that. if you're the kind of person that likes your steak super juicy w/ sauce on top, don't get it! If you like dry rubs, this is for you. My friend said the mesa margarita was one of the best drinks he's had- made sure to get 2. I got the pomegranate martini that was so strong it took me the entire night to finish it. Bang for the buck! \n\nWe got the cookies for dessert and it was probably the most disappointing part of the meal so I really wish I had gotten something different. Not disgusting or anything but just alright. \n\nOverall it was YUMMY. Brussel sprouts and sweet potato for sides were great. The service was incredible- truly above and beyond."

            "review": "For my #100 review, it will go to none other than the restaurant owned by my celebrity crush, Bobby Flay! I am a hugeeee fan of Bobby Flay, and food network, Iron Chef in particular.  I have always wanted to try his menu and ever since I found out he had a restaurant in Las Vegas, I been waiting for the next time I went to eat at Mesa Grill.  Well after going to vegas for 4 times and NOT having the chance to eat at Mesa Grill, I finally got to go eat lunch at Mesa Grill this past weekend.\n\nI would have much rather come here for dinner, since it has a wider variety than lunch, but I was still very excited none the less.  Everyone in my group got their own lunch entree, and a few of us shared a couple appetizers.  For appetizers, I got to try the Blue Corn Pancake, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos, and the Spicy Beef Tenderloin Tartare.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - I LOVED this appetizer! Bobby Flay is known for his chili sauces, and it did not disappoint!  The sauce went soo well with the tender duck and soft pancake.  The only bad thing about this dish was that there was not enough of it!\n\nRough Cut Tuna Nachos - I love raw appetizers, tuna and salmon dishes especially. The Mango and Habanero hot sauce mixture was very different for me, but still good. \n\nSpicy Beef Tenderloin Tartae - It said it comes with a green onion potato salad but I have no idea where that was.  It was presented with the tenderloin tartare, a few pieces of toast, and shitake mushrooms.  My first time eating raw beef in a tartare form and I really liked it.  It was good by itself, or piled onto the toasted bread and a piece of the shitake mushroom.\n\nWhile everyone else chose a burger or sandwich, I tried to be different and went along with the Mahi Mahi with roasted pineapple sauce and, caramalized pineapple, and creamy green chili rice.  I'm terribly sorry to say Bobby Flay, but this is probably one of the worst dish I have ever ordered.  The mahi mahi was tasteless and very dry, and it did not go well with the rest of the dish.  I enjoyed eating the little pieces of pineapple and the rice more than the main part of the dish.  My friend had said, \"the one person that wanted to go here the most, ordered the worst\" Minus 1 star for this dish, or else it would've been a 5 star restaurant to me.\n\nHowever, I was able to try the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and the Pressed Cuban Burger, both which was amazingly good, especially the Pressed Cuban Burger.  When I first read it on the menu, I was confused because it didn't mention a burger patty, just smoked ham, and I did not want it.  What a big mistake! The smoked ham along the juicy burger and swiss cheese, pickles, and roasted garlic mayonnaise was to die for! Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. The New Mexican Spiced Pork sandwich was a little simpler tasting, but still very good. The pork was well seasoned and not try like most pork pieces would be.\n\nTwo of my friends ordered from the pri fixe menu that came with a chocolate dessert that we all got to sample.  I'm not sure what it is because it just said \"Chef's Dessert of the Day\" but it reminded me of a chocolate flan with some cookies.  I'm not a big chocolate fan but I really liked this dessert.  It was smooth and creamy and not too sweet.\n\nBesides my disappointment with my own entree, I loved everything else at Mesa Grill. The food took awhile to come out (I think they were waiting for all the dishes to be finished soo it can be served to all of us at the same time) but the service was good and Mesa Grill has a very nice atmosphere.  It is a little pricey, but what do you expect from a famous celebrity chef?  It's well worth it in my opinion.  I only wish to be given the chance to travel all around to dine at other Bobby Flay's Restaurants!"

They said their ribeyes were good, but in hindsight would have ordered the pork!\n\nThe Sweet Potato Tamale that came with the tenderloin was a bit overcooked and dry, but still tasty.\n\nI'd give Mesa Grill 5 stars, but this was the one in Vegas.  I'm just not a fan of Vegas, but with all the celebrity chef places popping up, my point of view may change..."

Great southwest flavors in each dish we had. For an appetizer we had the cremini quesadilla. For the entree we had the ahi tuna steak and cous cous and brussel sprouts. Last but not least the dessert was banana cream pie. All was delicious. A pleasing dining experience that we will definitely have again the next time we are in Vegas."

HUGE portion btw.  It really just melts in your mouth.  I also tried the lobster tacos for appetizer and the cobb salad.  And to drink, you can't go wrong with a white peach margarita!\n\nHats off to you Chef Bobby Flay :)"

Luckily, although we had reservations at 8:30 and arrived early at 8, we were seated right away.\n\nI wasn't feeling to well so I asked for a hot water with lemon and honey. I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came and was not charged for it. \n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the pan seared scallops, which were cooked to perfection. Every bite pretty much melted in my mouth. I ordered the pork tenderloin, cooked medium, for my entree and it was perfect. After both dishes, I was too full for dessert.\n\nMy bf ordered the lobster tacos for his appetizer and it was AMAZING. The shell was so crispy, and the lobster filling was very flavorful. It came it 3 pieces, but were very small, pretty much bite sized. For this entree he got the cascabel chile crusted rabbit. I wasn't very impressed with this dish. I've had rabbit before, and enjoyed it. But, the  rabbit here was very tough. This was the only dish the was a disappointment. \n\nOverall, the service was impeccable, and the food overall was good!"

Meat = perfect(I got medium), Sauces = perfect complements, and pre-dinner bread = bomb.  There was a side that I'm not too sure if they still serve for dinner, but it was some kind  of corn dish, and it was AMAZING.  All in all, worthy of the 60+ $ spent to enjoy high class cookery.\n\n2)  Had to hit it up for some BRUNCH, YO!\nA group of us all ordered different things and all dishes were amazingly unique for being brunch type dishes.  I got the Burger, and for only a couple more bucks than a Denny's burger, it was worth it.  Friends got the chilequiles(bomb) and enchiladas(bomb).  Others ordered too but didn't get a chance to try them all.  Again, the bread was very good to start out with.\n\nOne con...

The peach margarita I got was very strong. Our table got great service. As other reviews mention, it's right by the sports betting area so you WILL hear loud cheering going on when touchdowns etc. are made--didn't bother us too much.\n\nFood: quesadilla appetizer was delicious but beware it's filling. We tried one of the specials--Brussels sprouts with a marmalade dressing. Really tasty. We also got the sweet potato appetizer, SO good. Salmon we would pass on next time--it tasted unusually fishy. The toffee bread pudding was a perfect end to the meal. Would come back!"

I have to say after my last experience here when I brought my sister for lunch I didn't leave excited to come back.  \n\nBut tonight I had one of those odd cravings for the Lemon Tini that I sipped last time and I was determined that this time not only was I going to satisfy my craving, I would know NOT TO ORDER THE SALMON and to order instead what my sister ordered-the CORNMEAL CRUSTED CHILI RELLENO!  But more important to take the hubby to a great fun place for dinner on the strip.\n\nWe didn't have reservations but they found us a nice table with a fantastic waiter.\n\nDrinks were Belgian Beer for the Mr. and for me the Lemon Drop Martini.  Sweet and sour just like it should be.  Loved it.\n\nSquash Blossoms filled with yumminess just laying in a sauce of I don't know what but every bite was heavenly. Only three were on a plate-there should be at least four or five or six or...you will not get enough of these!\n\nChili Relleno was what I expected since my sister had ordered this last time we were here. The chile was stuffed with roasted eggplant and Manchego cheese, it rested on some sweet red pepper sauce and dusted with cornmeal that created the perfection.  OH MY! Crispy on the outside and gooey melted cheese on the inside with just the right amount of spice.\n\nHubby had the halibut and I had a bite of his and another flavorful exotic blend of flavors that will satisfy you and leave you asking for more.\n\nWe topped it off with dos cappuccinos and the churros con chocolate which came with two yummy chocolate dipping sauces and  a nice little candle.  The only complaint was that the churros were crispy and not warm and soft (c'mon even Sea World serves them up warm and fresh lets do this right next time). One sauce was chocolate and the other was Dulce de Leche. \n\nDespite the lack of soft Churros, I'm sure I'll be back."

I had always disliked tamales because of some certain flavor that I always tasted, but I gave it a shot with the limited selection of restaurant week. It was AMAZING. The corn tamale was creamy and more corn flavored than anything. The shrimps were juicy and chewy.\n\nThe next is the coffee rubbed filet mignon. I don't normally use all capital, but this dish deserve all capital. It was DELICIOUS!! The filet mignon is cooked to perfection. Even though the chef slice is through the middle making it like sandwich for some weird reason. Never had it served that way. I'm still savoring the taste. A definitely must order there.\n\nThe trio of sorbet consisted of cactus, coconut and mango. I was expecting a more slushie texture sorbet like it usually is. I was pleasantly surprised that it was thick and creamy. When I was eating the mango, I was overwhelmed with spiciness. Apparently it was mango with cayenne pepper. Immediately eating the coconut after definitely soothes it. Give it a try!"

Not  this time, folks. Go. To. Mesa Grill. Now. Really, it's just that simple. Do you want delicious upscale Southwestern food? If you're nodding and/or answered yes - get your booty here as fast as it will go.\n\nThe goat cheese queso was amazing and quickly devoured. So quickly in fact, that our waiter had to comment. Very funny sir. Bring me more of that for your insolence. The 'ritas were good - even my bf who normally doesn't like them enjoyed his. Not overly strong or sweet, they're like Goldilocks would say, just right. Entrees were HUGE! I wouldn't say Mesa Grill is pricey by any means, but you definitely walk out of there feeling like you got what you paid for. I had the salmon and the bf had the veal chop. Both were mouthwatering and required a few laps around the strip to work off. \n\nLoved the decor and the ambiance inside. It wasn't too dressy, so jeans are acceptable. But if you did dress up, no one would say you looked out of place."

New York, VEGAS (at Caesar's Palace across from Pure) and the Bahamas (at the Cove, at the Atlantis in Paradise Island).  Mesa offers lunch and dinner, as well as brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. The food is spicy, inventive and ExCeLLeNT!\n\nFor dinner, start off with the Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck and the Sophie's Chopped Salad (with chick peas, olives and tortillas).  Famous for southwestern cuisine and grilling, be ready for some spicy meat!  The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with a Sweet Potato Tamale and Crushed Pecan Butter.... damn! The Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with Red Chile, Lime and Rosemary, with Green Corn Pudding.... whew... sexy!  Blue Corn Soft Shell Crabs with Bacon, Green Onion and Chile Vinegar... I could go on and on.\n\nIf you can make it for brunch... please do!  I think it may be better than dinner.  First off, a ridiculously amazing bread basket- my favorite is the spicy, corn muffins with pieces of corn in it and swirls of spice.  For your entree, definitely have the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs and Green Chile Hollandaise.  I can not even explain how good this is.  Sort of like a spicy Eggs Benedict with chicken and sweet potato homefries.  Some one always orders the Eggs and Aged Sirloin Tortilla with Roasted Peppers and Avocado Relish... and loves it!  It is simple, but delish... think make your own tacos with steak and eggs.\n\nNo matter what meal you eat, the tequila cocktails are the perfect accompaniment.    Hands down, the Cactus Pear Margarita wins it!  Watch out boys... its pink!\n\nThe Scene- Always full... full of Foodies!  Lively!  \n\nFood and Drinks- 5: Mind Blowing and Life Changing.  \n\nTip Worthy- 5: The New Yorker 25-30%.  Excellent service... 3 to 4 servers at a time... one water, one bread, busy boy and waiter... without being the LEAST BIT stuffy.\n\nCoordinates- 4: Neighborhood- Centrally located! \n\nRestaurant Return Rate- Green light!  Between the three Mesa's, we have had at least 10 meals.  We bring everyone we know when there is one close by.  \n\nThis review written by Angela."

I ordered the chilaquiles, which were to die for. SO SO good. Layers of corn tostada with a green sauce and eggs and cheese with a swirl of a red sauce on top.

Also had a cactus pear margarita. Everything that I had was very good with lots of flavor. Both sandwiches were excellent with good amount of meat to each sandwich. Perfect toast to the bread and sandwiches were both dressed well.  Probably prefer the smoked salmon club, but just a matter of personal preference as each sandwich was done well. I do think the fries that came with the sandwiches were weak component of meal as they were not crisp.  May have been a matter of them sitting on warming tray or perhaps is consequence of the basket that was used as serving dish that did not allow them to breathe.  They were however, well-seasoned w/ some sort of Southwestern spice mix.  The margarita was refreshing but not exactly a bargain at 15 bucks.  I guess thats what happens in Vegas.  All in all, it was a great lunch and I will go back again next time I'm in Vegas.  If they can fix the fries then it would be 5 stars."

We (as always if there is a we that means husband and I) went mainly because it's a Bobby Flay restaurant so that swayed us. Also- with so many choices of good places, the menu looked good. \nIt was an early lunch because we were starvino and just got off the plan a few hours before. \nso we had the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla as a starter. As a disclaimer, i think anything with truffle oil tastes good. I also love mushrooms. It was really good- I like the crunch to the  quesadilla and the hummus on a quesadilla was new to me and beats the questionable tomato salsa with the salmonella scare.\nSo-how do you review eating a salad? It's pretty much greens and meat right?  I had the  16 spice chicken salad. The rub on the chicken was pretty flavorful and i've only started ordering chicken at restaurants (personal reasons but sometimes i think eating chicken at restaurants is a waste- but hey it's salad).  Overall it's a good salad and goat cheese is probably my favorite cheese.\nMy husband had the New Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich which was really tender. The fries had a kick to it.\nTo digress (or not) Bobby Flay is all about simple food with lots of flavoring. The husband summed it up that you can either go totally wrong with all the spices or it works.  I think it works for him.\nYes- we start drinking once we hit the ground in Vegas. I had a special drink of the day a watermelon margarita...really refreshing and not watered down. there is enough water in the watermelon! Husband is a mojito and wished for more mojitos. The glassware is super cute.\nI think they gave us 3 kinds of breads, memorable was the spicy jalepeno corn muffin. I watched a Bobby Flay Showdown episode where they had the kentucky browns which he served in his restaurant. I saw it on the menu but thought it would be too heavy for me, so i live in a world of regret. jk\nService I can't say much for. We were early so we were jocked and they were very nice and attentive. I thought they were good. \nIf I were you- i'd try it. If you are waiting in line for Pure- maybe one stooge of a friend can sit there while you enjoy a drink and appie and trade off. If i go back for dinner- i'll revise."

My husband then had the pork loin and loved it. It was spicy, but expected as the server explained it accurately. I had the Mahi with peppercorn sauce, and while it was good, it came out rare, not mecium rare, and then I had to wait while hub ate. I hate that. We also had the corn and loved it.

If I am wrong, I will come back later and update this review.\n\nI came here with my dad, lady, and brother. I think my dad did something to make my step-mom mad...she decided to not come with us. That was kind of weird, now that I think back on it. This was back in November. I can't remember how it all resolved.\n\nThe food was great, the service was great, Bobby Flay is great, and I am feeling great today.\n\nGreat? Great."

Because it was Sunday at 11:30am, we were told brunch was served.  \n\nThe brunch menu was kind of limited  (http://www.mesagrill.com/lasvegas/pdf/mesalvbrunch.01.08.10.pdf).  We decided on the following:\n\n1)  TIGER SHRIMP TAMALE with CREAMED CORN (not on the above menu) - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=bZdGAk4KyioloJNNm9GiIA) This was quite good.  I'm not a fan of tamale but I enjoyed the creamed corn and the shrimps (total of 4!).  \n\n2)  ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON in Spicy Black Bean Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema - $22. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=ZzxIYMiVP3O1osnjdF4Hfg) I ordered it well done.  The salmon was very tender with good flavor.  However it must have sat on the counter for awhile b/c it was barely lukewarm!  \n\n3)  NEW MEXICAN SPICED PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICH Grilled Red Onion, Arugula Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise + Southwestern Fries - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=QQ6QbO2CmSWDD7l9OwudAw) This was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  My fiance gave it 1 star.  Enough said.  \n\nService was spotty.  At first it was really good, but then it just went down hill.  Like I said earlier, our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhile b/c my salmon was barely lukewarm and my fiance's sandwich (the pork tenderloin) was cold and hard!  Our iced teas were getting refilled until we were done eating.  Then they took the plates away and didn't bother asking if we would like another refill.  C'mon, even if we're done, we might still like some more ice tea!\n\nI thought the quality and service didn't measure up to my expectation and the prices.  3 stars is all it gets."

At 9:30, the lobby, bar, and host area were standing room only as guests eagerly awaited the raved culinary creations of Bobby Flay. Everything was perfect, except two minor flaws in the meal. The pork dish comes with a sweeter, barbecue like glaze on the side that detracts from the peppery rub and flavor of the meat and the house margaritas were too tart. For top dollar, you think they could make a better margarita."

There were two big about one cup size of sweet potato hash with poached eggs on top. The entree presentation was amazing and I feel all presentation really brings out my appetite. I highly recommend this dish. \n\nPulled pork sandwich: The sandwich was made perfectly and had just the right amount of crunch from the bread. This meal came with seasoned fries and it was quite delicious \n\nSalmon Entree: The piece of salmon was just simply amazing. It had the right amount of sauce and seasoning that the fish just melts in your mouth. I chose to have it well done and it was just the perfect salmon. \n\nAlso, for starters they provided free bread and it was not just cheap white bread. It was home made muffins, mini corn muffins, and different type of bread. This place really does set a high standard because food presentation and quality. \n\nI was fortunate to try this place for free but with the prices it is a pricy place to eat. For vegas, I think its definitely a place to try especially since it from one of the chefs I enjoy watching on the food channel."

I'm ambivalent about celebrity chefs as a whole but some are really good: Thomas Keller and Marcus Samuelsson come to mind.\n\nFood is surprisingly good. Blue corn pancake and shrimp to start. Rabbit on green pea cous cous blew my mind. It was really phenomenal. Rib eye was super yummy. Fish was decent.\n\nIt's a lot less expensive than Masa or Robuchon.  It's got great service. The spiciness was just right, subtle but carries punch. \n\nThis is what I think about celebrity chef restaurants. Some can be very good (Red Rooster in Harlem), and some can be impressively bad (Paula Deen's the Lady and Sons in Savannah), but most of them are going to be somewhere in between. \n\nWhat's unusual about Mesa grill is that it's quite a different type of southwestern restaurant. The side corn reminded me of Mac and Cheese. Bobby Flay took something ordinary and made them into extraordinary. Few people can get rabbit right. He did. This restaurant did.\n\nSeeking a mid price range restaurant in the casino that guarantees a full basket of carbs shortly after you order, and serves up 22 oz rib eye to curb your steak craving? Seek no longer."

I knew it was Bobby Flay's restaurant, so I was anxious to try it (I'm OBSESSED with the Food Network.) We started off with an interesting, but tasty bottle of Rioja. I believe it's a Spanish wine. Kind of a peppery taste. Our eyes bigger than our stomaches, we decided to start with the Rough Cut Tuna 'Nachos.' They came out and were almost to pretty to eat. They had the muli-colored corn chips that were cut in perfect circles. Then a nice, rare piece of tuna that was nicely chopped to drizzle the chips. Followed with mango and hot sauce on top. Delicious! The service was great! Our waitress would fill our glasses just as they got a little low. Very friendly and attentive! She even made several great entree suggestions. Everything looked so great, but I guess I was just in the mood for more tuna. I ordered the Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna Steak. I ordered mine rare. It tasted as though it was infused with cinnammon and was absolutely the best tuna steak I have ever had! Then they gave me a side of toasted pine nut cous cous. It had a nice coating of crisp, and cooked to perfection. My colleague ordered the Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I took a bite, not being a big pork fan and was hooked. It just melted in my mouth. We were so full, our plates still had more food and we thought this was the best meal ever and never wanted to stop.  Hahah it was a very good choice. Mia even left with a new cookbook. :)"

I'm on a personal mission to eat at every TV chef's restaurant (though I'm not sure if Yan Can's take out spot counts).  So we've been planning this meal since our last Vegas trip.  Reservations were made in advance but the place was pretty chill on a Thursday night so they probably weren't necessary.  \n\nThey start with a variety of breads, including yellow + blue cornbread and a roll with olives that looked like sun dried tomatoes (pretty good stuff).  We made use of it to the best of our ability and dipped it in the remaining sauce from the BOMB ass raw tuna nachos.  If you like poke, you'll probably like the nachos.  Although it was one of those \"what the fuck\" sized appetizers, it was perfect - not too filling but enough that we didn't feel jipped (raw tuna goes a long way).  It was served over half mango hot sauce, half blended avocado sauce w/ this orangy oil on the rim, like the shit you see at Chinese restaurants.  \n\nFor the main dish my girl got the 16 spice chicken which was a little better than my pork tenderloin.  Both were good but I unconsciously ate half her plate.  The sweet potato tamale that came w/ mine was way better than her blue corn one though.  Plates aren't \"what the fuck\" sized - they will fill you up - but they come pretty much naked, no starches or anything.  We had to chill at the hotel room for a lil bit before going back out to party.  \n\nOverall it was a great experience, no probs with the waiter/staff.  The food is good but not the best shit I ever had...that's what I reserve the 5th star for."

Bobby toes a fine line for me between being a cocky jerk and being 100% awesome, but I was excited to try his food nonetheless.  \n\nWe went for a boozy brunch on Saturday morning and I thought it was a quality (if not slightly expensive) pick.  I had just finished scarfing down an almond croissant in the hotel room so I opted to go slightly lighter on the brunch ordering with the famed shrimp and roasted garlic tamale.  While it was good, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't packing more flavor.  I know that the description didn't scream spicy, but it's a Bobby Flay restaurant - I guess I was expecting a kick somewhere.  The tamale was among the best I've had, though I wished the shrimp would have been grilled instead of poached or whatever they were - I think that would have really bolstered the flavor profile a bit and may have made me not miss the spice.    \n\nTwo of my galpals split the eggs and striploin tortilla - that was out of this world.  Luckily for me, my friends like to share.  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and I loved the combo with the grilled peppers and onions.  Don't miss this one.  \n\nEveryone else had the cactus pear margarita and I ordered the spicy bloody mary.  While it was spicy enough for my liking, it wasn't my favorite bloody mary.  It was mostly spice and not enough tomato flavor.  The margaritas were awesome though - I had orderer's remorse with that one.  \n\nTruth be told, this review is probably closer to 3.5 stars than 4 stars but I'm giving Bobby the benefit of the doubt here."

The margaritas were just right, with a nice kick of tequila. Then our appetizer came, the shrimp were meh but the tamale, it was not like any I've had before.

We also ordered a side of glazed baby carrots in chile de arbol and brown sugar.  Now, I'm not usually a big meat eater but I decided to order it and order it medium well.

It also came with a delicious tamale. hmmm..just talking about it makes me wish I was back in Vegas. I tried some of the medium rare steak and that did NOT dissapoint either. I was very suprised since I am not into red meat. The carrots were alright.\n\nFor dessert we had some of their home made churros with chocolate dipping sauce.

You could definitely taste the hint of garlic as well. The tiger shrimp were cooked perfectly. I got the hot smoked salmon sandwich with the southwest French fries. The sandwich was the size of the state of Nevada. So huge! It was a pretty tasty sandwich although I think it was a bit much. My colleague got the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.

The best thing I tried the whole night was the fried squash blossom appetizer-- fresh, tasty and savory with a light batter on the outside and a wonderfully smooth ricotta filling.  The other dishes, however, were too over-seasoned for my palette.  I'm the kind of guy who thinks spices and sauces should compliment the flavor of the meat, not mask it.  I'm fairly sure my pork tenderloin (apparently the \"signature\" dish) was brined before it was cooked, which was totally unnecessary.   The result was an extremely salty cut of meat that was too soft with little texture.  Any hint of pork flavor that may have been left after the brining was heavily masked by a trio of overpowering sauces and a crust of spices (and possibly more salt?).  Needless to say, I think I would slaughter Bobby Flay in a pork tendrloin throw-down.\n\nAlso, don't come here wearing a hat, as they will make you take it off.

So, when we recently traveled to Las Vegas I knew this is where I wanted to go. Unfortunately, on the night we had reservations I had a terrible headache, so I didn't get to eat as much as I would have liked. Ideally we would have tried one or two appetizers, each had an entr\u00e9e and at least one side, cocktails, and a dessert. However, due to my headache we stuck with entr\u00e9es, sides, and cocktails only. \n\nThe meal started with a delicious bread basket. Mesa Grill offers several types of bread, including their signature blue corn jalapeno corn muffins, and each one was delicious; but, my favorite was by far the asiago jalapeno bread. It was phenomenal. I could probably eat half a loaf of that bread alone. \n\nWe each wanted steak, and would have gone with the filet mignon, but neither of us really wanted coffee crusted, so we both ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak. I ordered mine medium-well (I know, I know.. the chef anywhere you go never recommends above medium; but, that's how I like steak and that's how I want it cooked), and unfortunately it came out well done. I mean, all the way cooked through thoroughly well done. In the restaurant's defense I didn't mention it to the server, so they were never aware of the issue, but I still feel like a steak cooked at a restaurant, especially an upscale restaurant like Mesa Grill, should come out the way you requested it. I'm not really the type to make a fuss about food anyway, but on this particular night we had show tickets following dinner, so we wouldn't have been able to wait for another steak anyway, so I just didn't see the point of mentioning it. At that point there was nothing we could do to fix it. B had ordered medium and his steak was cooked to perfection for me. I had a few bites of his, but left mine on the plate. At the end of our meal our server did ask if I would like to box my steak up, but she didn't ask if it was ok or if there had been something wrong with it. \n\nWe shared the Roasted Corn, which is served with chipotle aioli, lime cilantro, and cotija cheese and the Cilantro Mashed Potatoes. Both of the sides were great. We finished them completely. B had the Mesa Grill Margarita and I enjoyed the Cactus Pear Margarita. Again, both cocktails were fabulous and we drank them completely. \n\nI really wanted to love this restaurant. I had waited to eat here for so long. But, unfortunately, the over-cooked steak made my meal far less enjoyable than it could have been. If we ever make it back to Mesa Grill I'll be sure to ask for my steak to be cooked less done than I actually want it."

Holy cow....what more can I say that hasn't already been said.\n\nAfter a day at the Convention Center, a group of us headed over to watch Monday Night Football at Caeser's Palace.  Thankfully, one of us thought ahead and got reservations at Mesa Grill.  Our previous plan of Nobu would have to wait.  The game was entertaining as hell and we headed over to Bobby Flay's place.\n\nI love a wide open room like they have here.  Much better Vegas ambiance than tiny little rooms.  Very simple decor with the tequila bar and open kitchen dominating the view.\n\nThe Yelp reviews gave me a great preview of what to order and my dining partners appreciated the hints I was able to provide.\n\nIt took a long time to get a drink order.  When I mentioned a margarita, I had to wait to get the special margarita menu.  How many ways can you make a margarita?  Apparently about 190.  The menu was ridiculous.  Far too many choices.  Geez, it's just tequila.  I took the waiter's recommendation and was not disappointed.  It was not cheap, maybe $15, by the time the extra options were added up.  It was delicious.  \n\nAppetizers were next.  The Queso Fundido (Blue corn chips and a hot cheeze dip) was wonderful.  Cheesy and spicy.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamales were just amazing.  Kind of small portions but the tastes were unique and complementary.  We also had the blue corn crusted squid.  Lightly crunchy with a tangy sauce.\n\nI had the blue corn crusted halibut.  Off the chart fantastic.  I love a simple piece of grilled meat or fish with a plain starch and veggie.  Here, you are subjected to a wild array of seasonings, toppings, garnishes, etc.  They hit the spot....big time.  A meaty fish that held up to the accompaniments.  Absolutely delicious.  \n\nMy dining partners had the pork tenderloin, duck breast and the rib eye steak.  Four dudes sitting around the table offering each other bites.  So very uncool, so very yummy.  Sides of spinach and corn rounded out the main dishes.\n\nWe split the toasted coconut layer cake.  Very tasty, indeed.  \n\nI'm not a huge Bobby Flay, TV star, fan.  I am a giant Bobby Flay, fill my gut with tasty food, fan.  Highly recommended."

I was happy to see a good assortment of whiskeys.\n\nWe started off the meal with the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  It was excellent.  By far the best queso fundido I have had maybe ever.\n\nThey bring a good variety of bread to the table.  I am partial to the cornbread.  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked in.\n\nFor my entree I chose the Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt.  It was great.  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg.  The meat was tender, and the sauce added great flavor.  Even the toasted cous cous was tasty.\n\nThis place is always busy.  Book your reservations several days in advance if you have a specific time in mind."

            "review": "My girlfriend and I went to Las Vegas last weekend for her birthday. As soon as we got to our room in the Monte Carlo, we naturally began searching Yelp for nearby restaurants. When we found out that one of our favorite Food Network Chefs, Bobby Flay, had a restaurant at Caesar's Palace, it instantly shot to the top of our list. \n\nWe went to Mesa Grill for our last night, after going to Wolfgang Puck's, Lupo and Emeril Lagasse's Table Ten the nights before. The location was very convenient since Caesar's Palace is in the middle of the strip and the restaurant itself was absolutely gorgeous, very clean and modern. Everything you could possibly want for a classy Las Vegas experience. \n\nPersonally I still had some doubts because Tex Mex is not my girlfriend's or my favorite type of cuisine, we never seek it out, but I would say I don't have much knowledge about it either. I didn't find the whole idea of Tex Mex too appealing.\n\nI started getting even more concerned when I found the wait staff to be a little pretentious and more than a little snooty. Our main waiter in particular made me feel like we didn't belong since we're a young couple blowing all our money on this short getaway and not some rich established older people who can really afford to got to a place like this without worrying about making rent. Anyway he seemed rather annoyed at our amateur etiquette overall ignorance regarding such extravagance. But I think we won him over with our charm by the end.\n\nThe man who took our cocktail orders was by far the best, giving us all kinds of knowledge about the menu, making friendly conversation, sharing his personal preferences and just really making time to stop by a few times just so see how our drink experience specifically was going. The drinks were absolutely delicious.\n\nBe excited about some pretty good free bread to help prepare you for the journey ahead. The bread grew on me as I ate more, but it was nothing to\n\nWe actually tried to save money by getting two appetizers, the Tiger Shrimp Tamale and Blue Corn Pancake, and only getting one entree, the Chile Relleno (one of my favorite dishes in life that was conveniently the most inexpensive entree on the menu). But when we tasted the appetizers, we instantly ordered another Entree, the Pork Tenderloin. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale especially was like tasting heaven. It the shrimp was zesty and bold pairing perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce. The texture of the tamale was very pleasing and the consistency  was tender, but still substantial. The Blue Corn Pancake was also delicious, the flavor was more simple, the duck was very juicy and was smothered in a succulent dark, deep, rich, velvety sauce. It was very aromatic, just a truly seductive dish.\n\nThe Chile Relleno had the most stunning presentation in my opinion. The cornmeal crust is that perfect amount of golden crisp, not oily. It's satisfying cracking it open like Creme Brulee and unleashing the cheezy melty, spicy explosion within. There are so many textural layers that make the experience of eating it so dynamic and just adds to the diversity of flavor. I've never had anything like it; by far one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in my entire life. It was like eating art.\n\nThe Pork Tenderloin was also breathtaking to look at, and my girlfriend would say it was the prettiest presentation, but we would both agree it was the best dish of the whole meal. I never knew that meat could be prepared in such a way where every nuance, every single note of flavor possible to achieve in the universe can sing in harmony together so immaculately. Every single flavor that has ever excited my taste buds came flooding back and brought back friends I never knew existed and we danced, danced, danced! Pure ecstasy. After that is kind of a blur. All I know is that I had eaten the best thing I have ever tasted.\n\nAnd that wasn't even the end. We were so drunk on the pleasures of food and drink that we ordered dessert, the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. The coconut shone throughout the dish, the cake was incredibly moist, the icing was soft and delicate and the Cr\u00e8me Anglaise just took the cake to another level of decadence. \n\nOverall the meal was one of the best in my whole life. The experience was also one of the best in my entire life, but I wouldn't call the restaurant experience perfect because of the service. In general Las Vegas service lacks in attitude. They do all the right things technically, but their attitude, personality, and what they say always leaves a lot to be desired. There's is rarely genuine friendly service and this restaurant, sadly was no exception in that area. But I still give the restaurant five stars for just being so breathtakingly delicious, the restaurant's atmosphere was beautiful and clean, and the service was still professional, fast and insanely efficient (when we ordered another entree, they still came out at the same time only minutes after we told them). Yes, go here! The end."

            "review": "The GF and I were looking to indulge in a proper lunch before leaving for our flight back to Philly. So after checking out at Caesars Palace, we stopped by Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. While the original NYC restaurant is now closed (he's got Bar Americain and the recently opened Gato now), in Vegas, the Iron Chef is still able to showcase the Southwestern flavors and flair he's known for.\n\nLocated a stone's throw away from the opulent Omnia nightclub, Mesa Grill is sleekly designed with Southwest elements and colors. \n\nBread Service\n\nBread service started us off with a nice variety of freshly baked sourdough, cranberry walnut, and a great blue and sweet corn muffin with a bit of jalapeno. Nice.\n\nGoat Cheese Queso Fundido [$16]\nRajas, blistered serrano vinaigrette, blue corn tortilla strips\n\nWe had the goat cheese queso fundido, which was gorgeously creamy. It had some nice heat from the blistered serrano vinaigrette, which was accented by the roasted red and green chiles. The cilantro added a nicely fresh herbaceouness to each bite. The crispy blue corn tortilla strips were a great vessel to scoop up all the deliciousness.\n\nTiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale [$18]\nCorn, cilantro sauce\n\nEasily one of the best tamale's I've had, the creamy richness of the roasted garlic and sweet corn sauce on point. The tiger shrimp was supple, yet had good snap and the corn masa within was luxurious and not at all dry. The cilantro sprig helped to brighten up each bite. \n\nSpicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash [$18]\nPoached eggs, green chile hollandaise\n\nThe GF went with the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash for her main. There was a great lusciousness to each bite, with some texture from the sweet potato and the moist chicken. The green chile hollandaise had a bit of heat to it, though very slight. The poached egg brought each bite over the top. \n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno [$18]\nRoasted eggplant, manchego cheese, sweet red pepper sauce, balsamic vinegar\n\nMy cornmeal crusted chile relleno offered great texture from the cornmeal crust, which cracked open to reveal a creamy manchego malenge with well-roasted eggplant. The green and red sauces emblematic of Bobby Flay were on display here and not just for show. Along with the sweet notes from the balsamic, these sauces helped to providing some acidic balance to each bite. \n\nOverall, Mesa Grill was spot on in terms of execution and taste. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend stopping by, especially if you're looking for a glimpse into the flavors that are the foundation of Iron Chef Bobby Flay."

            "review": "Mr. Bobby Flay.  I feel I can now feel like you aren't just some TV cook! (sorry...) So Mesa Grill has been at the Caesar's for a while now and I'm always thinking, why would I pay a premium for Mexican food?  I live in LA; I have Mexican food everywhere.  But I see the light now.  It's Mexican/Southwestern fusion-ish food.  I came for lunch on Saturday and even though I made a reservation through Open Table, it wasn't busy.\n\nApps: Tiger Shrimp & Corn Tamale.  Only one is enough because it is super rich with the sauce but it is oh so good.  The corn was the sweet it needed to bite through all the garlic you taste from the tamale and sauce.  I felt a bit of a kick in the flavor as well.  The tamale was probably the best thing we had.\n\nEntrees: Ranch Style Egg Tostada.  A sizeable scrambled egg atop a fried tortilla with a red chile sauce.  The like how the crunch tostada provided a different texture from the fluffy eggs.  Not very rich so it felt somewhat healthy.  The cheese added a bit of needed fat that I felt was  needed.  Overall a decent dish.\n\nChicken and Sweet Potato Hash: Sweet potato hash was a bit strange for me.  The hash made it too sweet and the chicken wasn't spicy enough to make it all come together.  The poached egg provided the fat but in the end just an OK dish.\n\nThe bread basket included an assortment of breads including the blue cornmeal cornbread muffin.  I thought this was the star of the basket.\n\nSo Mr. Bobby Flay.  The meal was pretty good.  Some dishes better than others.  I will definitely be back for the shrimp tamale and I heard there was a shrimp taco special which I wish I got.  As for these brunch dishes, I think I'd prefer coming during another meal time to see what other dishes you have that aren't so \"brunchy\"."

The waiter Jose was great, friendly, informative, and tentative not to mention a really good photographer...  The d\u00e9cor was nice but our table felt like we were stuck in a corner (which we were), other staff workers were friendly and overall very good service/vibe from everyone but I am not here for the service or nice people I need to have my culinary taste buds get its ass kicked which unfortunately never happened... first disappointment was the menu, it had a fairly limited amount of items to choose from, Rib eye, pork chops, Tuna, Grouper among other disappoints the whole menu was filled with very common items you can get at almost any restaurant ....  I mean WTF where is the Iron chef I see on TV? I can get a grouper sandwich in Miami for $5.00, Second disappointment was my 22oz ribeye ordered medium rare and was server mostly raw, the one thing I hate is having to ask the water to send a steak back it kills the rhythm of the dinner and believe me I know the difference between Rare, medium rare and medium, My better half had the Tuna which was perfectly done but not that hard to accomplish since they lightly seared a sushi grade piece of tuna, Mashed potatoes OK but I could make them much better myself, cream corn was nice but where is the kick it up a notch? I felt like I was having dinner from a chef that just graduated from culinary school...   I must admit either the hype on TV is way over kill or BF dose not have his arms completely wrapped around the food coming out of the kitchen....\nAppetizer, 2 drinks, bottled H20, 2 entrees & 3 sides tax and tip $250.00...."

The food was priced like a Morton's Steakhouse but not up to the standards.  The side dishes were small, not very good, and not well executed.  The entrees were prepared well, however the price is not worth it.  In my opinion I would skip over this place and go off the strip to a non tourist trap that is much better food, and much nicer environment.  The decor of this place is that of a TGI Fridays with a slightly more classy twist.  I have dined in a lot of find dining establishments and this did not meet my expectations in the least.  The $13 margaritas on the rocks tasted like it came from mix not made from scratch.  \n\nAlso to make a reservation for a Saturday night party of 5 took 2 managers to approve and an act of congress."

When I questioned the waiter, he was condescending and said \"They don't like overcooking duck- that's the way it should be.\"  Ooookay, I guess being the customer and paying $40 for raw duck is my fault and I'm too stupid to know what I like.  The pork was ok, but again was undercooked.  The sweet potato tamale was good as was the salmon.

I had a tamale and the pork tenderloin, which was amazingly tender.

We were familiar with the Chef/Owner Bobby Flay from television and the fact we were staying at Caesar's Palace were contributing factors. The reviews on YELP made the decision a little easier. \n\nWe arrived a little early and our table was being prepared. We sat in a waiting area and were immediately approached by a young lady to see if we would desire a drink. Of course we did and just as she delivered the libations the table was ready. We had a strategically place two top in a corner that would have been my choice if given the opportunity. \n\nOur waiter was Arnel and the sommelier was Bernardo. Both made our multi hour meal one of the best. We found wines at a wide range of prices but we decided on a somewhat reasonable priced Stags Merlot. The service and attention was as good as it gets and without interfering with dinner and conversation. Arnel will be requested on any future visit to Las Vegas. \n\nOur plan was for a long culinary experience tasting and sharing as much as was reasonable. What is also helpful is the servings are not large. The Tuna Nachos and the Shrimp Tamale were very scrumptious and flavorful. The hotness was just right for New Orleans' type of diners.\n\nPermit me to mention that we noticed as soon as we sat down and entered into a conversation about the food and its' preparation with Arnel that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table. We were hoping that meant we would be served food seasoned properly and we were. \n\nFor what I will term our entr\u00e9es for the evening were the Scallops and the Pork Tenderloin. Scallops have to be cooked perfectly and they were. The Pork Tenderloin was just too good. Our taste buds were in ecstasy. To find a Five Star restaurant in Las Vegas and one in a casino even if it is Caesar's took us back a little. \n\nOne side dish has to be mention and that was the Mashed Potatoes. My wife made comment that she will not be able to eat any of the potatoes without additional seasoning. After tasting a fork full I informed her that would not be necessary. She tasted and agreed. Some of the best mashed potatoes I have consumed in a restaurant were at the Mesa Grill. \n\nWe ended with decadent Banana Pie and illy coffee that made us so pleased that we did not have far to go to return to our room.\n\nThe Mesa Grill has My Seal of Approval."

We were seated & greeted by our waiter in a timely manner, who did a nice job, overall.  He gave us the time to peruse the brunch menu & ask a few questions -- he, too, made a few suggestions -- the Mesa Grill margarita & Mesa Grill burger.\n\nHubby ordered a MG margarita (Loved it!) -- I stuck with water for brunch.  Then service slowed down,  I guess the kitchen was backed up, and our waiter was relatively attentive (until \"bill\" time -- when they all seem to disappear).\n\nWe ordered the Tenderloin Tartar for an appetizer -- great flavors -- capers & a nice amount of acid with a creamy caper aoili on top, with grilled bread as a side.  Nice flavors -- hit the spot -- set a high standard.\n\nWe also received the typical breadbasket with some hits & some misses -- the blue corn muffins were so dry they were almost inedible, but the blueberry crumble bar was divine & the little corn muffins with fresh jalapenos were delicious.  The cranberry & fruit/nuts muffin was ok.\n\nOur entrees, however, were not up to par.  Hubby got the MG Burger, ordered medium with a pink center.  Flavors were good, bread was nice, tomatoes were fresh; but, even though the burger was pink in the middle, it was incredibly dry -- almost inedible.  Not sure why?  Pulled off grill to sit & wait during the rush?\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.  The eggs & hollandaise were great -- would order again if I could have them on some other starch.  The chicken-sweet potato hash was incredibly sweet -- not enough savory or heat to offset the sweetness.  It was way, way beyond the average sweetness of a baked sweet potato -- not sure what was added to make it so sweet.  I ended up eating the eggs, etc. off of the hash & leaving the rest.\n\nThen, it was time to leave -- and our ever-attentive waiter disappeared.  We ended up doing the \"leave the credit card on the table\" trick to get his attention, so we didn't even look at the bill before he took our credit card -- but, we were just happy to have him swipe the card & get going.\n\nThe Tendeloin tartar was all Chef Flay can be, but the signature MG Burger was so far short of our expectations and. I'm sure, of Chef Flay's expectations, that I would have to believe the burger was a fluke.  The chicken-sweet potato hash needs reworking as far as I'm concerned.  Not enough heat or flavor profile to offset the sweet.  \n\nGo back?  Probably not -- Las Vegas has enough other wonderful restaurants that I'm not inclined to start repeating until we've gone through most of the other ones.  It's a shame -- I do like Chef Flay's cooking, even though I like to joke about the plethora of chipotles.\n\nChef Flay -- please look into these comments -- I realize you have restaurants all over the country -- but when your line cooks can't get your signature burger right -- you have to wonder.  I truly hate to give you 3 stars, I had hoped it would be an out-of-the-ballpark 5 star brunch; but with high expectations and the high standards that I'm sure you set for your kitchen staff, I was more than slightly disappointed in the quality and character of the food we received."

I loved the corn muffins.  They had a peppers in them giving them something special.  We ordered the shrimp tamale appetizer as a side to the rib eye and also the lamb.  The shrimp tamale was very very good.  Our only issue was we did not eat it soon enough and it got cold.  It was much better warm.  Not a fault of the restaurant.  The rib eye was also good but the quality of meat was not the best.  Definitely go to a steak house if you want real good steak.  The lamb was alright.  It had a sweet flavor I did not care for.  It was also served with a tamale.  Warning!  The tamales are not real tamales but I enjoyed them.  The service was excellent."

Next up, order yourself a wild mushroom quesadilla with white bean hummus and white truffle oil. It can be shared, but be selfish about it and get your own.  It's that good!  Next rule.  When ordering your entree, look only at the cornmeal crusted chile relleno.  For the fourth and final rule, order yourself the mashed potatoes with green chile queso sauce.  I've got no clue how Mr. Flay does what he does so well, but that man knows what he's doing.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable and knew what she was talking about when it came time to answering questions about the menu.  A wonderful dining experience.  We'll be sure to go back on our next trip to Sin City."

I'd give it a 3, she gives it a 5... so we agreed to split it down the middle.\n\nIts not that the food or service or anything was bad, its just spicy... really spicy.  Everything is spicy!  My mouth was burning after each bite.  \n\nJust to start, I decided since it was a south west style restaurant, I would get a tequila.  The poor was tiny.  I mean, it was a shot in a large glass... kinda disappointing.\n\nFor the food, the wife got the Sweet Potato soup...  She loved it, but thought it was spicy (needed a few extra glasses of water).  I shared the apps with the rest of the family.  Tiger shrimp was very good.  Blue corn pancake was excellent!  Meatballs were just ok.  \n\nFor dinners, the wife got the Relleno.  She loved it (as did her brother who said it was the best plate on the table).  I had the Pork Tenderloins.  Interesting presentation, good flavor, but it completely overpowered the pork.  It could have been anything with the spices on it, and tasted the same.  \n\nFor dessert, we got the churros.  Not so great.  Sauces were good, but the churros were nothing you couldn't get from a vendor at Disney.  \n\nAtmosphere is great.  Service was right on spot, but as I said, food was a little disappointing for me."

The Fries however were the biggest disappointment with \"special spices just dumped over the top of them and were very cold. I would like to give another try but $50 for lunch for a local is a little steep so I might have to save for a date night someday.\n\nWell my second chance at Mesa was not any better than the first. I had the Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. It looked nice in presentation with an egg on top 2 bright orange circular mounds. However it was anything but spicy and very sweet.

We were lucky enough to walk in without a reservation, only because it was 4pm. When we left around 7pm I am guessing we wouldn't have stood a chance coming in with out one at that time because the place was packed. We started with the southwestern and chopped salads. All three were so good, i kept wanting to eat my Dads and step Moms too. Our waiter must have though I lacked table manners because the whole time I was sticking my fork into my parents plates, but I couldn't help it! Everything was so good! The bread, oh the bread! So yummy! Everything here has this south western flare to it even the breads. One bread had jalapenos and cheese in it, a match made in heaven. There were little corn muffins too and assorted breads all fantastic as well. I ordered a fish dish and of course it was nothing short of spectacular. My favorite was the pork tenderloin and sweet potato tamales that that my step mom had ordered, they were to die for. The meat was falling off the bone! \n\nThis was possibly the best service ever, hands down! They wait on you hand and foot. It seemed like we had a server and about two bussers per table. Whenever we needed anything or even started to look like we might need something one of them was right there to take our order, order more drinks, or clear our plates. I'm definitely going back again even if my parents aren't there to pay for it this time."

I had pretty high expectations for my dinner here... and was NOT disappointed.\n\nAesthetically, this restaurant is beautiful.  The hand blown glass lighting in bright colors interspersed throughout the restaurant was beautiful, and tastefully placed.  Coupled with wood and copper, I really loved the atmosphere here.\n\nAt Bobby Flay's restaurant I would expect service to be top notch... and it was.  Never a less then half full water, and prompt clearing of plates or refilling of bread.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the food, and wine pairings, which is a must with this caliber of restaurant.\n\nMy girls and I started off with a round of White Peach Margaritas.  All I can say is... wow... best... margarita... ever... seriously.  For an appetizer we ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  Delicious!  I'm a pretty big queso fan, along with goat cheese, so the marrying of the two was amazing for me.  I also really enjoyed the basket of bread, brought to every table once drinks were served.  There were 3 types of bread: a jalapeno-cheddar sourdough, and 2 others.  (You can tell which one I absolutely LOVED.)\n\nFor dinner I just had to order the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops:  Tangerine-Roasted Jalapeno-Mint Sauce w/ a Plantain Tamale with Molasses Butter.  The lamb was cooked at a perfect medium... tender, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  One of the best lamb dishes I have ever had.  The tamale was nothing to write home about, but I had plenty of lamb to fill me up, that It wasn't a huge deal.  I also had bites of my friends' steak and pork tenderloin dishes... both equally amazing (well, maybe not AS good, because they weren't lamb).\n\nWe got a couple side dishes to share as well: 1.) Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale w/ Thyme Butter, and 2.) Roasted Corn, Smoked Chiles, Cotija Cheese w/ Lime.  Again, the tamale was just okay... all the tamales kind of tasted alike for me.  But the corn... on my god, the corn.  We fought over the last few morsels of food left in that dish.  This is one of those dishes that you bring up days later: \"Remember that corn dish from Mesa Grill?  Oh, that was sooo good!\".  I checked my Mesa Grill cookbook the day I got home, and found the recipe in it!  And yes, I recently made it... pretty damn close to the real thing!\n\nSo for me, a restaurant that lives up to its expectations is pretty rare.  But this place did it.  When you have a name like Bobby Flay behind you, everything needs to be spot on.  Of course some things were better then others, but the over experience was definitely deserving of 5-stars."

My wife was very adventurous on this trip.  She usually doesn't eat things like Duck but she really enjoyed this.\n\nI had one of the best Tuna Steaks I have ever had.  It was perfectly prepared rare.  My wife had the Ancho Salmon, another beautiful dish.  I had a side of the Collards, and they were wonderful.  My wife had a side of the Brussels but she did not like the Pomegranate taste.\n\nSay what you want about Bobby Flay.  He's arrogant.  But if you're name is on a restaurant that is cranking out this quality, you would be arrogant too.  I feel like I understand Chef Flay a little better."

The blue corn pancake with duck for appetizer and the ancho chile honey glazed salmon for entree. The blue corn pancake was more like a crepe which paired perfectly with the BBQ duck. This dish was very good! \n\nThe salmon was cooked well but unfortunately it was too salty to eat. The first few bites were delicious - smokey flavors with a sweetness - but once I was working towards the middle of the filet, it became just salt. Then I found a big bone in my salmon as well. I left the rest of the fish untouched - at this point, it was inedible.\n\nI rarely send back a plate and I did not send it back this time either. The bartender noticed and asked so I told him what was wrong with the dish. He offered the kitchen to remake it for me, which I appreciated, but it was late and I was already thrown off by the dish.\n\nI was disappointed by my experience with the entree at Mesa.

There were 4 of us in our party - 2 adults & 2 kids under age of 10.\n\nMenu varies for lunch & dinner. We chose to go for an early dinner - around 5-ish. We were seated right away in the back part of resturant in a round table. Was a nice \"view\" of the resturant, cooking stations, and other tables. Perhaps a little less noisy than the rest of the place. We were able to talk amongst ourselves just fine. (Even share a bit of conversation wtih members of the table right next to us.)\n\nAdults had the Tuna steak. (I really enjoyed it medium-rare. My husband had it med-well.) The poblano-peppercorn sauce was tasty and married well with the couscus. Our portions were a good size, I thought. We also had an order of the lobster tacos - good flavor. I agree wth Cat P. that the asiago cheese jalapeno bread was the best of all the breads in the bread basket ;-) \n\nWe initially were going to order a couple apps for the kids - but our waiter suggested a burger or cheese burger for them. (Nice touch! And worth the $12 for a grade-A burger w/ fries.)  They enjoyed refillable sodas/lemonaide. While the adults drank tasty margaritas - go ahead, try the signature White peach Margarita!  \n\nDesert... ah, the finishing touch on a great meal. We shared 2 deserts: toasted coconut cake and banana cream pie. Not too sweet and hit the spot. \n\nService notes: Our waitstaff was attentive, knowledgable about the menu, and were delightful with the two kids.\n\nWhat we might do differently next time: Say no to the mineral water ($8.50 per bottle was a bit too spendy.)\n\nIt was a good meal that came with a price. It could be considered your \"big spend\" item while visiting. We would consider coming back (just with Adults). \n\nSave a Margarita for me.....!"

I've watched Bobby Flay cook on TV and the food always looked good, so out of curiosity, I wanted to actually try out his food.  He tends to favor Southwestern and Cajun style dishes.  \n\nMy bf and I were immediately seated during lunch time.  The place was surprisingly not busy at all and there were many empty tables.  Our waitress came by and gave us menu and took our drink orders.  She was very attentive and knowledgeable.  She recommended the Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon, and the Smoked Shrimp Taco.  She said that these were their best sellers.  After looking over Yelp for some recommendations, we decided to go with what the waitress recommended.\n\nNext, she delivered bread and butter to the table.  There were three different kinds of breads and each one had a different flavor, but they were all pretty good.  Don't eat too much of it though otherwise you will be too full when the real meal comes.\n\nWhen our Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale came, it was presented beautifully and had corn kernels and a tasty creamy cilantro sauce.  This dish was delicious and I liked how it was seasoned perfectly.  It wasn't bland and the flavoring was not overwhelming either.  It was just right.  The only downside for me was the price of the appetizer which was $19!  I thought that was pretty expensive for a fairly small portion.\n\nThe Smoked Shrimp Tacos came with red cabbage slaw, grilled tortillas, avocado, tomatillo & mango salsas.  My bf really enjoyed the tacos and thought they were delicious!  The dish only came with two tacos though and the dish was for $25.\n\nMy Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon came with a spicy black bean sauce, tomatillos, and a roasted jalapeno creama.  My salmon was cooked to perfection.  For someone who hates beans, the dish was very good and all of the ingredients went really well together.  This dish too was $25.\n\nOverall, our service was excellent and our food was really good!  I would highly recommend trying out the dishes that we had ordered.  However, the prices of the food is kind of expensive for small portions.  If you have the funds to try Mesa Grill, I'd highly recommend it.  Maybe go play some slots and win big before coming here."

Was talkative but not overbearing, knowledgeable and tolerable (at least with the idiots next to me who apparently didn't believe that anything could be better than Disaronno).\n\nMargaritas (white peach in my case) were strong and went down easily...luckily I stopped after one!  Quesidillas were okay - nothing too memorable.  But the corn soup was complex and delicious.\n\nI wish I had had more of an appetite.  There were a bunch of things I would've loved to have tried.  Overall a pretty decent experience though."

But the Baby Romaine salad here was world class. I don't know what the dressing was but it was some kind of garlic concoction mixed with aged salami, Parmesan crust flakes, romaine lettuce and these delicious deep fried hominy cubes that served as croutons. Holy Crap that was good. You guys just ruined salad for the rest of my life...in a good way."

Food wasn't terrible, as long as you don't like pairing wine with dinner. We tried wine that the waitress suggested and literally never tasted the wine due to completely scorched taste buds. A filet that roasts your mouth? I expected to taste a top quality piece of beef nicely complemented by wine. Instead tasted...hot pepper and was that wine? Not sure. It was red but had no chance at coming through after my mouth being blown out by pepper. Weird thing is I like spicy food, this just didn't go with a steak. Not up to the hype or the price tag. Apparently Mr. Flay hasn't checked in with his \"chef\" lately."

            "review": "I had brunch here with 7 other friends. The order was as follows (Best to Worst, 1-6): \n\nBread Assortment (complimentary)\nThere were about four different kinds. A couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) Queso Fundido $12\nA light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. I've had this one before at the NYC location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) Spicy Chicken + Sweet potato hash $18\nGreat breakfast dish. It came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) Scrambled Eggs Chiliquiles with Roasted Tomatillo Sauce\nWhite Cheddar Cheese + Creme Fraiche $14\nAnother great dish. It came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\nI had no clue what Chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nChilaquiles is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. Sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nThey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or scrambled eggs or a Mexican style grilled beef. Moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nUnlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. This makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) Mesa Burger $16\nThe most memorable part of this dish was the price. The fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. But, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, and\nAncho-Chile Mayonnaise $15\nI thought this was the worst of the dishes. The beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. The waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. The ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce and Caramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa $24\nI was hung over, which is the only way I could why I order this dish. The sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. The texture was a little dry. Overall, not worth $24. The waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nMy friend got a bloody mary. I'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nService\nVery slow. Starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. They were consistent with it, at least. And still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.\n\nSo, what did we learn? For brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. Based on my experience in NYC, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat."

            "review": "Not much to add that hasn't been said before so I will reiterate what I found helpful. I've been for both brunch and dinner - equally amazing whichever way you go, but brunch is a serious fraction of the dinner cost (less than half). First tip: share everything.  It means you can experiment with more foods, and the portions are pretty crazy (especially the steaks).  Personally, for my husband and I we do 2 apps, 1 steak and 2 sides for dinner.  For breakfast, we did 1 app and 2 entrees.  Second tip: order the margarita that they advertise as the perfect margarita (it's pretty close).  Third tip: order the tiger shrimp tamale appetizer, the one that was featured on the Best Food I Ever Ate (it is that good).  \n\nOnly drawback is that the place is popular, which means a few things you have to just accept and move past so they don't ruin the experience: reservations on popular weekends have to be made weeks in advance (on Halloween weekend we had to reserve with a credit card and $50 no show commitment), the reservation time doesn't always correlate to the time you will be seated (on busy nights the place is definitely overbooked), bar area is small so waiting for your table with a drink in hand is harder than it should be. Lastly, while the servers have always been very knowledgeable, cool and have a pretty iron clad spiel to pump you up about the impending awesomeness of your meal, the front desk is a bit snotty (especially for a place with cowhide covered seats) and you just have to brush off the attitude."

We go to Las Vegas several times a year and always eat at a highly reviewed restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful with enough atmosphere yet enough quiet places.  Our waitress was really knowledgeable and terrific.  The bread basket was yummy and plentiful....although we would have liked to have been asked if we wanted more.  My mojito and husband's peach margarita were refreshing.  My husband had the chicken (($24) and I had the veal chop ($42).  Mine included a tamale, my husbands just the chicken.  With cocktails at $12-13 things get expensive fast...which we knew.\n\nMy veal chop was really really good as was my husband's chicken.  BUT, when you spend $150 for 2 I really expect to be at the restaurant for 1.5-2 hours....fine dining.  After an hour the busboy came by to clear my plate....I wasn't done and did not intend to be done as this was our evening out.  After the third time I asked him to please stop asking me if I was done.\n\nSo, the price for quantity of food was 25% higher than needed.  The food was excellent. And we disliked being rushed while paying dining prices.  So we will not come back and revisit past restaurants such as 808 at Ceasars."

My 16 spice chicken salad was good, but am not sure that it was way ahead of other good lunch salads I've had.\n\nService was a bit rough at first, but got better as lunch went on.

And it's free!\n\nAppetizer: forgot the name, but it was chunks of tuna w/ jalapeno & cilantro bits w/ guacamole & mango sauce, came with a small bowl of blue corn & rice chips.

Pork Tenderloin - This is their specialty dish and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The meat was tender, juicy, very flavorful. The tamale that came with it was just OK, rather dry unfortunately. \n\n3. Tuna Steak - MUST SKIP! First time it came it was overcooked (dry, and cooked all the way, although I asked for seared w/ rare middle). The waiter was very polite and apologetic.

Our waiter then came to take our drink order and provided the house recommendations. \n\nFor drinks, we went for the Mesa Margarita which was very nice and refreshing.\n\nFor appetizer, we ordered the house specialty Blue Corn pancake with BBQ duck. It was VERY good and it made my wife a duck eater now which she wasn't before having experienced duck at another restaurant but didn't like so much. It had a great BBQ flavor and the blue corn pancake looked like a crepe and worked nicely together. It was great but $15 for one duck pancake was a little steep. \n\nFor entree, I ordered the house specialty Pork Tenderloin which was absolutely phenomenal. I'm so happy I ordered this dish because it was banging with flavor throughout the entire dish and every bite...melt in your mouth tenderloin!! Smokey and full of flavor! \n\nMy wife ordered the chipotle bone-in rib eye medium rare which she enjoyed but she definitely liked the pork tenderloin much better.  \n\nFor a side, we ordered the roasted corn that had cotija cheese aka mexican cheese, a creamy sauce and OMG it was sooo DELICIOUS and a great compliment to our dishes. Again, lots and lots of flavor in this side dish!\n\nWe really enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely be back...after we try Gordon Ramsy's Steak restaurant. ;)"

Then for dinner I had the Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken (I don't really eat fish or red meat. Yet, I really wanted to eat here.

The classic was delicious with a good balance of flavors. The cactus pear was sweeter and while it started well, I was over the sweetness by the end.\n\nBlue Corn Lobster Tacos - talk about a flavor explosion... these were amazing! Definitely try these.\n\nGrilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - tender, succulent lamb chops that were grilled to perfection. The mint chimichurri sauce was delicious. It came with a plantain tamale which sounded better than it tasted (again, my aversion to things too sweet).\n\n22oz Bone-in Rib-eye - big, bold, yummy...\n\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts - I know, I know, it's just brussels sprouts. But you haven't had these brussels sprouts. You must get these.\n\nFor dessert we had the Churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise. The star anise was subtle and gave the churros an interesting scent and flavor. It was served with a dark chocolate and a coconut dulce de leche dipping sauce, the latter of which we could have licked out of the bowl. A great way to end the night.\n\nAs for dinner service, it left a little to be desired. Technically everything was executed fine. It's the little details like, the tables that flanked us were seated after us and offered dark napkins due to the customer's dark clothing. My husband and I were also in dark clothing but were not offered dark napkins, so I fussed with white lint on my black shirt the rest of the evening. And the server was effusive in his recommendations and menu explanations to both tables flanking us but didn't offer anything to us. It was weird and an example of how much better everything could have been.\n\nMotivated by the exceptional food, we came back for brunch and had the spicy scrambled eggs - perfect balance of spice, creaminess, sweet, salty, tangy. The service was great this time and it was an awesome way to start the day."

If your staying at Caesars and don't want to venture out, give it a try, you'll have a good meal.  What Mr. Flay does - is his own & unique and worth experiencing at least once."

The margaritas were great and the sweet potato clam chowder was unique and well seasoned.  The blue corn tamale side was dry, odd for something steamed, the replacement was equally bad.  The meat was okay but nothing to write home about.  For the price point I expected more.  If I was at my local steak house paying half that the value would have been there."

While the food we ordered was very flavorful and fresh tasting the portion sizes and prices were a little disappointing. We started off with the lobster taco appetizer which was recommended by our waitress. It came with three tiny bite size \"tacos.\" They had good flavor but definitely not worth $20 for about two bites. Next we ordered the spice rubbed pork loin to share. The food presentation was great, and it tasted delicious, but once again we assumed we could share. We left hungry. \n\nMaybe we are not high class enough for this place? I don't know. But in my opinion I think it might be another celebrity chef restaurant hype. Most likely will not visit again."

            "review": "After Food Trucks became trendy in 2010, people loved all things fusion.  Craziness persisted.  We saw stuff like sushi in burritos, we saw french fries with kimchi, and we saw bacon in everything.  Before the craze, chefs like Bobby Flay and David Chang established their names with their creative fusion blends.\n\nJust because foods are creative doesn't mean that they'll be good.  One of the problems with fusion foods is that they tend to be one dimensional.  They're usually spicy or tangy or sweet or bacon-infused to the MAX.     \n\nYou gain an appreciation for this place as soon as you try one of their dishes.  Take their popular \"blue corn pancake\", for instance.  It looks simple:  you have a thin blue cornmeal crepe and it's filled with barbecue duck.  You take a bite and you notice the sweet notes of the barbeque sauce.  That taste fades and you then notice the tender duck meat.  The dish is small, so it forces you to eat slowly to make it last.   As you chew slowly, the subtle, nutty heat of the habanero sauce begins to rise.     \n\nFlay's appetizers are full of flavors that are distinct without being over-the-top.  \n\nWhen I came here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend, we opted to sample several appetizer instead of choosing one main course.  We knew that it would be the best way to get a good mix of flavors.  \n\nYou can't miss the roasted garlic tamales with tiger shrimp.  It was a favorite of my girlfriend.  The chef said that it is the most popular appetizer and that the recipe has not changed in twenty years.\n\nMy favorite side dish was their roasted corn.  It reminded me of ordering corn at a park in East LA.   You get the flavors of lime, garlic, white corn, various cheeses.  It's great street food, but improved upon.  But their sweet potatoes are good too.  It's served au gratin.  It's creamy - it's very evident that they used a lot of cream here.  But it also has interesting spice that reminded me of pumpkin pie.   It's a nice, flavorful starch to complement their popular pork tenderloin or coffee-rubbed steak.\n\nThis is fusion done well.  Its flavor pops in three dimensions, but without the need of glasses."

All appetizers ranged from $11-16, and entrees from $30-50.   \n\nI had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  this was served with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a sweet potato tamale with pecan butter ($36).  OMFG.  It was pretty damn good.  Pork was cooked perfectly...medium.  Nice crust on the outside, tender on the inside.  The sweet potato tamale was delicious.  It reminded me of a new take on cornbread.  My husband ordered the Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken ($32).  This was accompanied by a mango-garlic sauce and mango salsa.  The chicken was very tender-not dry at all.  And the mango sauce and salsa went perfectly well with the chicken. \n\nMesa Grill was a good food experience, and I'm glad I gave it a try.  Good food, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere."

BUT with great Vegas luck, my family of five was able to be seated ASAP w/out reservations nor wait time. It was as if they were expecting our party of 5 yet there was a crowd just behind us who ended up waiting. Screening the menu everything sounded spicy so dining with young children and a senior citizen who cannot tolerate any level of spiciness had us very concerned. To be polite we went ahead and ordered while making sure to ask our waiter the spice level of each dish ordered and he assured us that the spices were more for marinating purposes and that it would be mild to the taste unless requested to any desired spice level. We trusted him and when the food arrived, everything from apps to entrees to desserts far exceeded our expectations. It turned out to be the best meal we had on our 4 day LV trip. The deep dish banana cream pie, pork chop special and cremini mushroom quesadillas are musts! We will definitely return to try more of the menu."

Clearly the flavors within (and everything augments the juicy, smoky burger, nothing overwhelms) don't need any help. \n\nI recommend you request the crispy, slightly spicy \"Adobo fries\" which normally come with the (sloppy, confusing) Media Noche burger, instead of the \"Southwest fries\" which usually come with the regular burger."

The tamale was top notch, and the Flay-concocted Corn-Cilantro Sauce will pair up nicely with other seafood and poultry dishes.  \n\n\nFor my entree, I selected Bobby Flay's signature dish \"New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter\".  It was cooked perfectly and the flavors was very unique and complimented each other.  The sweet potato tamale was the best I have ever had.\n\nI tried a sample of my friend's \"Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce\".  Filet Mignon was good, but aside from being tender (which is why most people order it) it lacked the flavor I crave from beef, but the accompaning Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce was super!\n\nThe Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut + Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 Tomatoes, Capers, Nicoise Olives, Fresh Basil + Oregano was also a nice fish entree.  And highly recommended.\n\nI know this review is based on a banquet experience instead of the more typical restaurant dining experience, but the food overall was good to great.

Shaved brussels sprouts mixed with thinly sliced gala apples and pomegranate pearls. The Spicy Tangerine Vinaigrette had some kick to it. This usually comes with goat cheese but I think it's very tasty without it. Pretty filling too and totally perfect after a night of drinking.\n\nAs for the \"life changing burger,\" I heard no complaints from our table.\n\nBtw, the bread basket looked pretty amazing. It was filled with mini muffins and baked goods, both sweet and savory. While I didn't partake, the other ladies in the group were raving about it."

Call me cheap but if I plan on spending $300 on a dinner with my husband it better be amazing and this place was far from that. After we left this restaurant we went back to our room to where I proceeded to eat a large king size bag of chips I bought at the airport after we landed about 3 hours prior to our dinner reservations.\nLong story short, go to El Torito, go to the food court, or find a taco cart on the strip, any of those options would be more tasty than the food they serve here ."

Our waiter was as nice as could be, but it was very obvious that he was overworked.  He was covering an entire section of about 10 tables (all with 4+ guests) and he had a hard time providing enough attention to each one.  This was not his fault, but management's.  We ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido the second we sat down--it arrived nearly an hour later with our entrees.  Our drinks took about 30 minutes to be served.  All in all, brunch with 5 people took nearly 2.5 hours.  Be prepared to wait...and wait."

Staff was cordial and had good timing. But it absolutely sucked to be eating such a nice meal with a view of the sports betting area, watching two-bit bookies walk back and forth down the beaten path, swilling a high life. Walls are non tinted glass so everyone strolling through the area is looking at you and vice versa. Don't forget the added benefit of watching the sports betting area. Tacky. Well it is Vegas! \n\nScore: Minus -1 star. \n\nPrices: \nOne expects to pay premium at celebrity chef's eatery but also expects great food. But even this seemed to have an extra Vegas markup like everything else in Vegas. \n\nScore: Push \n\nFood/Wine: \nOk, I saved the best for last. The meal was good...really damned good! I love spices and after having tried Mesa Grill in Manhattan, I knew I would like the food here. I dined with two of my NASA buddies and we started off with three appetizers and would share: \n\n- Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Tamale: delicious! Was my favorite of the three apps (I loved them all though). But 16 for 3 shrimp? C'mon, man! \n\n- Blue Corn Pancake + BBQ Duck: another wonderful tasting app. Never had BBQ duck and couldn't get enough of it. Really, because it was about the size of coffee cup in diameter. \n\n- Cremini Mushroom Quesadilla: finally an app as big as it's price! Actually this was quite tasty and loved the fried quail egg on top.. Delish! \n\nFor my entree I had the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. it was maple glazed and served with a wild rice tamale. Damn, this was good. After using utensils for as long as I could, I went caveman style grabbed to bone and chewed off the last remnants. Yeah, it was that good. I tried a piece of the chipotle glazed bone-in rib eye...ahh hell yeah...I know what my next piece of meat at Mesa Grill will be. \n\nWe shared a 2006 (?) bottle of the Shafer Relentless and it was probably the best bottle of wine I 've ordered at a restaurant in a long time. It had a price to match it's taste, as well. I did think the wine list was a little unimpressive though.\n\nScore: 5 starts \n\nIt's really annoying and distracting to see the same guy about ten times over the course dinner, obviously placing bets for a number of people in the sports betting area. He literally walked into and out of view so much that we started betting on when he would pass by again. That plus seeing people wheel by with their luggage took away from a very enjoyable meal."

Now my feelings have changed. With there recent Michelin Star lose, I see no future regain of that star unless things greatly approve. \n\nI was seated within 5 minutes of arrival for my lunch in which they seemed to have a pretty packed house. Now when I go to a restaurant I expect to have my bread basket within 5-10 minutes once seated. I was seated for about 10 minutes when I placed my order and 5 minutes later they brought the bread. But enough about that. Of course the oh soooooooooooo good corn bread muffin was in there which is still to this day my favorite corn bread I've had and being southern I get around :)! It was tempting for me to order my favorite dish, Tiger Shrimp Tamale, but I wanted to try something new. I went with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos with grilled Onions and Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce. Once they arrived I was kinda put off that you basically have to make the tacos yourself. Now I'm far from lazy but when I go somewhere to eat I don't want to have to put together my own food because well, I'm there to relax and put my trust in the Chefs. But aside from that the flavors were very bold and went together perfect. The Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce had a very nice smokey taste with a good kick which is EXACTLY the kinda flavor I like. The chicken was very fatty which I wouldn't expect from a EX Michelin star restaurant but I guess thats where the EX comes into play. Overall the dish was good but I have had MUCH better from my local mexican restaurant down the street which is pretty sad.\n\nOverall this lunch was nothing like my first. The service was very decent besides the bread arrival. While I was left excited and couldn't wait to get back the first time, this time around I find myself only going back if someone else was paying."

Yum!! \n\nNext, we received the Goat Cheese \"Queso Fondido\" which was the perfect blend of creamy cheeses, topped with roasted peppers and served along side of some blue corn tortilla strips. The right size to split between a few people too. \n\nFinally, the long and awaited Yucatan Style Grouper, it was a citrus flavored grouper which was grilled (of course), atop a blue crab succotash with fava beans and corn. Somehow I can still taste the chives in the succotash tying the whole dish together. \n\nI'll be coming back....I'm already planning my next order for my return :)"

Everything from the service to the food to the atmosphere was top notch.\n\nThe service was attentive, knowledgeable, not pushy. The atmosphere was a subtle change from the chaos of Vegas and Caesar's Palace, and I love that they have a very open concept and feature the grill front and center.\n\nFor the food, you can't go wrong with anything. Get a Pisco Sour as your drink, a spicier version of a margarita hailing from South America. We started with the prawn tamales and they were heaven -- the quality of the shrimp set it apart from anything you've had elsewhere.\n\nFor dinner we split the ancho-chile crusted pork tenderloin (served medium) and it was so tender you could cut it with a spoon and didn't need to chew. Not sure where they get their pork, but I want to shop there.\n\nOn the side we ordered a twice baked potato (for the Mrs.) and some Mexican-style street corn with cotija cheese. The corn was easily one of the best side dishes I have ever had a restaurant, crisp, sweet, creamy, flavorful.\n\nWe skipped dessert because we didn't want to mess up the flavors we had going on, but in hind sight we should have kept going on that gravy train. All in all, great meal for around $100."

We came in from shopping from the Ceasar's forum and we just had on jeans and casual tops.  They had no problem taking us in without a reservation and seated us within 10 min of arriving.  It had a nice ambiance and not at all pretentious. Between the five of us we ordered:\n dad- 22oz bone-in chipotle glazed ribeye \n mom- new mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin with tamale\n bro- wild mushroom qusadilla with white truffle oil (appetizer)\n hubby- mango + spice crusted tuna steak with taosted pine nuts cous \n               cous\n me- blue corn pancake: barbecued duck + habanero chile + anise  \n         (appetizer)\n\nThe food arrived after 15-20 min. and meanwhile our server gave us a basket full of bread that had blue and yellow corn muffins, jalapeno bread and raisin and walnut bread.  The bread was ok and my dad and I thought the corn muffin seemed to tase a little bit like seafood flavor. The food arrived and I we all took a taste of each other's food.  For me the clear winner is the ribeye, it was very tender, juicy, very flavorful and my dad ate it all but the bone.  My mom's pork tenderloin was very flavorful and tha tamale was delish.  My hubby's tuna was cooked to perfection, it tasted fresh with no hint of fishines to it. The cous cous that came with it had a good sauce with it and went well with the tuna. My bro's qusadilla was a good size and the mushrooms in it was very tasty.  My own duck pancake was also very good.  I couldn't tell the meat in it was duck, it also could have been chicken but the sauce that it came in was delicious. \n\nAll in all the food was great, ambiance was lovely, and service was aaah maybe a 3.  Our waiter was good but his assistant ruined it for me.  He spilled coffee on me when he poured my second cup and got it on my arm.  When he offered to give me coffee to go, he took 10 min.. maybe longer, to tell me that they didn't have any cups. \n\nThe meal was good so I guess the last instances shouldn't really be blamed on the whole establishment so I still give this restaurant high markings.\nWill we come back again?  Maybe not.  There just too many great restaurants to try in Las Vegas and I have my eyes set on Bradley Ogden next."

The food is exceptional and the drinks are well paired.  This last visit in June of 2010, our waiter was very helpful.  He recommended a delicious cheese dip and always made sure we were taken care of without being annoying.  Mesa is a solid restaurant whenever you are feeling the southwestern bug in Vegas."

            "review": "Solid food. Not overrated at all.\n\nComing into Mesa Grill, I've really felt that Bobby Flay's such a overrated cook with a freaking ego problem. Ever seen Bobby Flay's throwdown on the food network? Annoying is all I can say.\n\nMy perspective has really changed, after dining here for a lunch. His ingredients, his hand in opening this restaurant, he can back up the s*it that he's talking. It's good, solid food. Not everything is transcendent brilliant - omg I could die right now - type of food, but a lot of his food has their moments.\n\nEven at the beginning, with the breadbasket, the experience starts. Extremely good stuff. Three different types of bread, all unique and brilliant in its own right. Jalapeno bread, Raisin Walnut bread, and Blue/Yellow cornbread muffins. The biggest highlight was the muffin - so sweet and slightly buttery for that savory taste. Even the crumbs in the breadbasket were subsequently picked out and devoured by myself.\n\nI'm lucky my girlfriend wanted some dishes from the prix fixe, so we were able to mix and match appetizers and entrees. \n\nI ordered a blue corn pancake, filled with duck in star anise sauce, with habanero sauce on top. Presentation was brilliant, flavor was excellent as well. The anise sauce tasted almost peking duck like, and had a significantly Asian feel to it with the cilantro. However, the dish was distinctly southwestern with the kick of the habanero. Very interesting how the dish crossed cultures.\n\nEntree was the Jamaican jerk chicken from the prix fixe menu, which was vastly unsatisfying and very disappointing. Flavor was decent, but you almost expect more from this dish.\n\nMy girlfriend had the Mesa burger, of which I ate half. It was a good burger, but the problem was, it was just a burger, nothing extremely special. I wasn't too impressed. However, I may have been offset in my burger opinions by just eating the Daniel Boulud burger a meal ago. Oh well.\n\nDessert came by with the prix fixe, and it was supposedly a lime sorbet, according to the server. It actually was a guava sorbet. And it has to be one of the best sorbets I've had - ever. That's saying a lot. Slightly tart flavor, but good sweetness, and key tasting of the texture of the guava sediment so commonly seen while drinking either guava juice or eating guavas. Kept the good pinkish color of the guava as well. A great end to that meal.\n\nDoes Mesa really deserve that shiny one Michelin floret (star)? I would say yes. But probably not more than that.\n\n4 stars - Solid. Some misses, but some absolutely brilliant dishes that really made me believe in this myth of Bobby Flay. He is a good innovator, no doubt about it. Definitely worth a visit, just to see for yourself."

The food was yummy to the tummy. I started out with the lobster tacos. They were so delicious and I think the best I have ever had in my life. Every bite full of lobster. I think I died and went to heaven. My favorite part of the meal was the tacos. Next I tried the chicken skewers these were scrumptious and the pickled onion and flavors were bursting in my mouth. I was so happy and impressed. For my entree I tried sixteen spice chicken. It sounded very exciting. The portion was generous and the flavor was good. I did expect it to be a bit more exciting after being wowed from the appetizers. So it was good, but not great. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant. I had a great experience and left full and satisfied."

            "review": "Surprisingly unimpressed. I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay and nothing really impressed me about Mesa Grill. There were three of us in our group and although the meals looked appetizing, our selections were just OK. I had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops with the plantain tamale dish. The lamb was well cooked and the plantain tamale was very nice, but once again completely unimpressed ... specially for the price. Our bill was $180 with tip and all three of us left Mesa Grill completely dissatisfied and we all agreed that we would not return. What made it even more dissatisfying was the impersonal staff. Our waiter rushed through our visit and didn't even take the time to explain the menu. They definitely run a tight ship here and there are no accommodations if you are early or late or if you're are missing part of your group. We were there on time, but the group on front of us was made to wait because they were a few minutes early. \n\nThe one reason why this review gets 3 stars (instead of 2) is because of the delicious dessert we had. My wife had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was heavenly. Exactly what you expect from a fine dining restaurant - I highly recommend it.\n\nHere are the pros and cons based on our visit. Pros: great location, nice wine and beer selections, dessert options. Cons: Overpriced, limited menu,  limited dietary options, unfriendly and unaccommodating staff."

Plus being one of Bobby Flays restaurants, I had high hopes.  We only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and the hostess was very nice.  I was impressed by the selection on the menu and many items looked good.    I started out with the Tiger Shrimp Tamales and they were very delicious.  I ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak in a medium well.   Well when I got the steak and cut into it the steak was barely rare.   We were sitting fairly close to the meat prep station and I had noticed the cook throw what looked like a frozen steak on the grill.   Then he was more focused on the monday night football game on the TV in the sports book.   To me there is no excuse to order a $48 steak and have it improperly cooked.  I had mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to recook the steak.  I am one not to send anything back to the kitchen because what I have heard they do to return orders.  I figured she would at least mention to the cook that he did not do a good job but she did not try.  Needless to say I was not happy and have definitely had better steaks from a Chili's restaurant.   Overall there was certain parts of the meal that were good but it was truly a disappointment."

The first time we came for lunch: \nI read the description of Sophie's chopped salad and wanted it, eyed a pretty salad that ended up being it, ordered it and enjoyed every bite. \nBf had the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad that was also delicious. Our company who came late ended up getting the same thing since it was so good. \n\nWe also came for weekend dinner.  As far as appetizers, the Lobster Tacos were filled with soft, delicious chopped lobster complimented by the crisp of the shell. The Blue Corn Pancakes with duck are very similar to a Chinese duck wrap dish, with a very rich flavor. For the main entree you can't go wrong with the lamb, pork chops, or the salmon... all were perfectly cooked and delicious. The tamales that come with the lamb and pork are a bit atypical, with a more ground up consistency than your normal formed tamale- the Sweet Pototo and the Plantain flavors were unique. \n\nBread basket was really unique: jalapeno corn bread (amaaazzing), walnut bread, asiago bun (drool).\n\nFriendly service, definitely on the slower side for weekend dinner (from ordering to food arrival was ~45 minutes."

The bread basket ( complimentary) was amazing from scones to cornbread. Have never been to a restaurant with such an amazing bread basket. Add to that the final courses of Ancho Salmon & Scrambled eggs with biscuits and the restaurant hit a home run. Margaritas were also tasty and unique ( pear cactus marg?!

For drinks the ladies had fresh margaritas, I loved the selection of tequilas as the had my favorite available Gran Centenario blanco.  The gents had beer of course IPA and loved it.  \n\nMain courses included the 20 oz rib eye, which was plenty to share.  Score!!  It was cooked to perfection and had a couple of sauces that accompanied it.  The cioppino was served with what taste like cilantro lime base a huge prawn and cooked to perfection scallop, along with halibut, mussels, and clams.  The portion sizes are perfect. I could not finish my soup after stealing some rib eye and twice baked potato.  Over all we completely enjoyed our dinner. The staff was fantastic and accommodated my gluten allergy which exceeded my expectations!!

Anyways, I digress...yes...Mesa Grill.  \n\nI'm a bit embarassed to say that I liked Mesa Grill (I still hate you, Bobby).  It wasn't fantastic, but, pretty, pretty, pretty good.  3.5 stars.\n\nMy restaurant week menu included the following: (1) blue corn pancake with bbq duck; (2) the New Mexico spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale; and (3) mango buttermilk upside-down cake.  I also ordered a prickly pear margarita.\n\nThe bbq duck in the blue corn pancake was a bit sweet for me; I found myself struggling to finish it.  Probably wouldn't order it again.  The pork tenderloin entree include three huge portions of perfectly cooked, moist pork slabs.  Awesome.  Unfortunately, the sweet potato tamale that accompanied the pork (and impossible to open) was really dry and added nothing to the dish.  The mango buttermilk upside-down cake dessert was okay but was elevated to good by the delicious rum caramel glaze topping the cake and mango ice cream.\n\nMy prickly pear margarita was good but a tad sweet.  I probably prefer a more traditional margarita.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the restaurant week menu with roasted corn soup,  Yucatan-style grouper, and key lime pie.  I took bites of his food and wished I had ordered his menu.  So, if you decide to try the Restaurant Week menu, I'd recommend you order his choice of dishes.\n\nBonus points to Bobby for not including any kokopelis or pictures of cacti in his restaurant.  I still hate it when you win throwdown.  That is all."

There were three different kinds, one for the each of us, including jalapeno cheese bread, cornbread, and raisin bread. It was a nice change from the usual, plain bread options.\n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the ancho chile-honey glazed salmon with roasted jalapeno crema, and my boyfriend had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale. I asked for my salmon to be cooked medium well, and for the pork tenderloin, the server recommended having it cooked medium, and my boyfriend agreed. \n\nI'm not big on seafood, but the salmon was amazing! It was light and moist, and the accompanying sauces were delicious. I ate it up! My boyfriend enjoyed the pork tenderloin. I had a bite, and it was incredibly tender. The tamale with crushed pecan butter was a nice side dish, but it was a little dry. We also shared a side of roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime, and cotija cheese. It was very creamy, but it was tasty and enough for the both of us.\n\nWe took a look at the dessert menu, and we wanted to try a chocolate and fruit dessert, but we were told that they were out, so apparently, it's a popular one. I can't find it on the current online menu. None of the other dessert options appealed to us, and we were full, so we skipped it.\n\nService was excellent. One of our servers accidentally dropped a piece of ice in our corn side dish, and before I realized what happened, he brought out another one for us at no extra charge. The atmosphere was nice, but the tables were a little too close together. Prices are expensive, but I think it was worth it."

It's hard not to compare this place with Red O, even though the other one is Mexican and this one is Southwest/Tex-Mex, both are well established celebrity chefs. The bread was fresh, one was kind of unique, like a cornbreadish with something else that I couldn't quite figure. It was interesting, but I wasn't sure if I like it or not. Since I was stuff from an earlier buffet, I elected to go with 2 appetizers. The blue corn pancake was their specialty and I could see why. It's an unique dish and the barbecued duck reminded me a little of peking duck. Quite bold flavors, that went well. I also had the spanish chorizo quesadilla with an perfectly cooked egg on top. This dish was bold as well. Not as balanced as the pancake but still pretty good. I also tried my friend's pork chop that I thought was excellently cooked and paired well with the sweet tamale because of the spicy rub on the pork chop. Had I been hungry, I would've ordered this instead. The execution of the dishes were spot on. Overall, I'd give this place 3.6 stars (lowly rounded up to a 4, which could very well be a 3). Maybe my tastebuds have become boring over the years. I just enjoy the simplicity of dishes these days, tasting the ingredients. Bobby Flay proved his himself, but he didn't win me over."

Since that's the mood Scott and I were in, it was perfect.  Our bartender/waiter (Beefy Greek Guy) was fun, engaging but not intrusive. \n\nThe fried green tomatoes with lump crab was fresh and delicious.  The corn off the cobb with Cotija was delicious and I didn't want to tell my friend how good it was in hopes that he wouldn't want to have any and I could have it all for myself.  The cauliflower gratin was a bit rich, so I was happy to share that one.  The chicken tacos were good too.  \n\nI was hesitant to go in here because I'm wary of the TV chef status of Bobby Flay.

Getting reservations was a challenge (did I really need to be transferred to 3 different people just to make one..?). Upon entering and being greeted, the ostentatious attitude of the staff was a bit much.. I mean, come one, it's just a restaurant at Ceasar's.. I'm not in Paris, San Francisco or the like... What was the worst part was the insensitivity of one of the hostesses. She really needed training. I wrote a letter to the corporate office some weeks after our visit with no reply. I guess they don't care if their staff offends an occasional patron, but that will be the first and last time I eat there. We had way better service at the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.. and it's a much more casual environment. Bobby Flay, you might want to investigate."

I'd heard so much great stuff about it, but turns out it was just okay.\n\nAs you'd expect with pretty much any upscale restaurant in a large Vegas hotel, the decor is over the top and the prices match. The food, while beautiful, didn't have the flavor to match its appearance.\n\nThe complimentary bread basket they brought us looked great and included garlic jalape\u00f1o bread, corn muffin (made with swirled blue and yellow cornmeal), and walnut raisin bread. The muffins were dry and pretty bland. The two breads were tasty, though.\n\nWhat had sold me on coming here was the dish that Flay is supposedly known for--the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. The shrimp and tamale were quite delicious, but the creamy sauce covering the whole dish was way salty and totally killed it for us.\n\nThe smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla was pretty dang smoky, which is not my jam (that was my own fault, though--it's right there in the name).\n\nThe cornmeal crusted chile relleno was beautiful, and had great crunch with the cornmeal coating, but some of the eggplant was undercooked and the flavors weren't really doing it for me.\n\nThe far and away highlight of the evening was the cauliflower gratin with roasted poblano. ORDER THIS! Super creamy and cheesy, with a really nice crisped top, loads of flavor, cooked to perfection. This dish is a contender for best thing I ate this Vegas trip. So good!\n\nThe service was good.\n\nMy husband would like to take this opportunity to register his complaint about the men's restroom: the urinals were ridiculously close together with no divider. \"If you weren't careful, you could run into each other!\" So, there's that."

Oh well, here in 2012 we like Yelp stars better anyway, don't we?\n\nLunch (12:30ish) was busy, with many patrons looking like they were brokering some kind of big shoulder pads deal at the table, but there were also plenty of tourists wearing \"ordinary\" clothes - nice jeans or pants, nondescript shirts, etc. One guy at the bar had a baseball cap on. A woman at the bar was dressed for a Pussycat Dolls audition. The typical range of casino couture.\n\nWe only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated at one of the many two-tops on the upper elevations in the restaurant.\n\n\"Remember those tables on our last cruise?\" Mike asked. He meant the ones where you could hug the people at the next table without hardly stretching. The closeness of these tables at Mesa Grill was disappointing, and next time I'd wait for something a little more to the side, or for a four-top when things are less busy. Being distracted by our neighbours' conversations as well as repeating ourselves in \"safe to be broadcasted\" murmurs is not part of my ideal dining experience.\n\nThe good news is that the food is so delicious that I can't wait to go back. \n\nOur meal started with a complimentary bread basket: Jalapeno Asiago, Corn Muffin, and Raisin Bread.\n\nI figured the corn muffin, a yin-yang mix of yellow and blue corn meal, would be the best. Mesa Grill specializes in southwestern cuisine, after all.\n\nMeh, it was okay. A bit flat. Maybe a tiny-tiny bit metallic? Then I tried the jalapeno and asiago slice.\n\nOh-Em-Geezers. A-MAAAA-ZING!\n\nHow could this unassuming white, porous, fluffy bread pack so much sharp and sour flavour with a crusty edge?\n\nI only had a little nibble of the raisin bread (sweet crumb, very bitter crust) because our appetizers arrived. Chicken and Black Bean Quesadillas for Mike, Cremini Mushroom Quesadillas for me.\n\nTwo words I could just copy and paste 100x into this review would be \"subtlety\" and \"layers.\" With every bite of everything we ordered at Mesa Grill there would be a new flavour to discover. I'm sure I ate half the meal with my head cocked as I tried to taste everything that had gone into the dishes.\n\nNobody adores cheese more than I do, and I know some people have criticized Mesa Grill for not offering very cheesy fare, but my quesadilla was perfectly \"cheesed.\" In fact, I kept peeking inside until I could figure it out, but the cheese was melted in such a way to completely cover and blend with the tortilla to create what I thought at first was just a thick bottom tortilla. Harmony: Mesa Grill does it.\n\nContrasting this pillow bottom was an overall crispiness. Crispy, but not burnt whatsoever. (I don't like even a suggestion of burnt taste.) Between the perfect cheese, the crunch, the light layer of mushrooms that didn't dominate the dish, and the yummy dollops of cream on top of each quarter-slice, how is there any praise left for the fried egg on top?\n\nOh, but there must be, because this was genius. The fried egg just added a very simple \"edge\" to the quesadilla's taste without interfering with any of the flavours already going on.\n\nMy stomach was full and my heart was broken that I couldn't eat my last three bites, but we did have main courses coming. Gah! (Next time I'll just get a starter and dessert and skip the corn muffin. There was absolutely no room for any of the exciting dessert options on this trip.)\n\nMike had ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which are an interpretation of satay sticks with tortillas and peanut-chile sauce. (I'll let him talk these up in his own review.) I ordered the only vegetarian item in the \"main dish\" section: the Cornmeal-Crusted Chile Relleno. (Note: there are more vegetarian appetizers.)\n\nOften I find chile rellenos too greasy or samey or gloopy, but they can be good. I wanted to see what Flay's people would do.\n\nShort version: it was the best chile relleno I've had in my life... and I say this even though I thought the cornmeal coat was absolutely bland if not a bit yucky. (If there was any seasoning, I couldn't taste it.) But once I peeled that back, the chile itself (and all the complex cheesy yumness inside) was delicious. With the herbs on top and drizzled sauces underneath, every bite was just as intriguing and new as with the quesadilla.\n\nYelp says I'm out of characters, so I'll just say this: Michelin needs to bring back the Las Vegas guide and bring back Bobby's star."

His food isn't too heavy on the sauces, butter, o.o. and he proved us right at this wonderful restaurant. \n\nAnyway, for my 2nd year wedding anniversary, I booked the MESA Grill at Caesar's in Vegas to celebrate (before we went next door to the Mirage to see The Beatles:LOVE by Cirque du Soleil, which was another 5-star performance).\n\nWe ordered the \"rough cut tuna tartar with mango hot sauce and avocado cream\" appetizer, as well as Yucatan chicken tacos with spicy peanut smoked bbq sauce and fresh mint and cilantro. For main, we split the veal chop recommended by our attentive server, and that came with a wild rice tamale filled with sage butter. We added a side of cornmeal-crusted Anaheim chile relleno with white cheddar, beans and rice. And for dessert, there were a few that we wanted to get but ended up with the sampler of warm chocolate cake with toasted pecan ice cream, smoked vanilla walnut flan with coffee caramel & bourbon-soaked banana cakes, and peach & blackberry shortcake with champagne blackberry sorbet. \n\nThe food was amazing and our server was just as amazing which made everything such a pleasant experience. The front desk host/hostesses (there were 3) were not as much but our server, I think was Michael, was not intrusive but informative and such a professional. \n\nSo I now have a much better opinion of Bobby Flay for having the staff that he has, both inside and outside the kitchen, who are able to sell not only his food but the entire dining experience."

Along with the venison was a grits tamale it also was tasteless, dry and overcooked. The side dish was delivered 20 minutes after the main dish was served. I was totally disapointed. I was most upset that I brought 4 others who were just as disapointed. Coming from a foodie that Loved Mesa Grill NYC, I would not recommend this Mesa Grill."

Everyone here is on point, from the hostess to our server. Ordered his Bloody Mary (spicy and good), the corn bread they serve (unique in taste and of course spicy) We ordered the queso fundido even though we were going to take advantage of the 3 course lunch. The queso fundido is the best cheesiest thing I have ever had( common theme here) comes with blue corn tortillas. For my first course ordered the sweet potato soup (creamy, sweet and spicy), Second course ordered his famous green chile burger with seasoned fries (perfectly seasoned), for dessert was a lemony sorbet with fresh fruit oh so refreshing to cleanse the palatte( and yes slight spice in that sorbet not in a bad way) Overall, we all left this place so uncomfortably full, but my table all agreed by FAR this was the best lunch we had all ever had!!! Bobby Flay is no joke when it comes to his restaurant!! He definitely rains supreme as an Iron chef!!!"

Server took 7 minutes to get to our table and when he did never introduced himself or gave us his name, just jumped straight in to \"What can I get ya?\" All horrible by any restaurant standards. He seemed either overwhelmed, poorly trained or distracted. I'm a service freak so it usually sets me on edge when someone can't concentrate on the most important function of their role.\n\nThen we received our meals and all was well with the world. I had the lamb with Serrano chile sauce that was so good I wanted to throw my plate across the room! All meals excellent. Server inattentive and never swung by the table to check on us. We had to flag someone else down for drinks and refills. \n\nThen, in keeping with the evening, the server, though our plates were cleared, didn't come back to the table for a very long time. We again flagged someone down to find him so we could get our check and leave. At that point we were frustrated and skipped dessert. \n\nI have the utmost respect for Mr. Flay. The food was fantastic. The service unfortunately lived far below the reputation his name should engender. I'll consider it an anomaly and hopefully the server has moved on and is working somewhere else. Food 5 stars, service 1 star. 4 stars out of respect for Bobby Flay. We'll try it again and hope to have good service."

One bite after another, you discover a new layer of taste in your food, now it's spicy, now it's tangy, now it's sweet, now it's salty! The colors are bright, the flavors are rich and bold, but you can still taste the ingredient. You still get to enjoy the buttery lobster tail. You still get that crunch in the corn. \n\nI can't voucher for the dishes my dining companions got, although it must say something if my husband decided to take his leftover pork tenderloin with us all the way back to SF. \n\nFrom the very start, the corn muffin was delicious with a bit of chili to give it a little kick. Duck with pancake was special and different from most duck I have tasted. Very saucy and flavorful. Side of corn reminded us of the Mexican corn from NY's Habana Cafe, but shaved and served in a small skillet so it was easy to share (and worth fighting for). My entree, the cioppino, had generous amount of mussels, fish, scallop and lobster tail. All delicious in a light green chile stew. \n\nVery memorable meal, very worth the very high price. Service was friendly and timely. It was a good idea to make a reservation even though it was a Sunday night. After arrived on time, we waited for a bit at the bar and enjoyed some delicious and pricey margaritas.\n\nYay for Bobby Flay!"

That was some good shiznick.  \n\nAs for the rest of the items we ordered, it was nothing fabulous.  I had a burger, which was cooked well, but lacked a bit in the seasoning department.  I thought that the Southwestern Fries were quite tasty however, but again nothing mind-shattering.  \n\nThe service here was pretty atrocious.  It took approximately 30 minutes after we ordered our food to see our actual entrees--some burgers and sandwiches.  The place wasn't even packed, so I don't believe that there was any excuse for such a delay in service.  On the upside, however, the slow service saved me from throwing away another $5 in a slot machine (I'm no gambler).\n\nMaybe dinner at Mesa is better--given how much I think about Bobby Flay, I'll probably try this place again next time I return to Sin City."

We enjoy sharing small plates so we chose from the appetizers and side dishes. Lobster tacos ($20 for 3 tiny tacos) were tasty but overpriced. \"Sofie's Salad\" was a major disappointment, anemic oxidized lettuce with canned beans and mealy chopped tomatoes, cold from refrigeration. Blue corn tamale side dish was like dry cornbread stuffed into a corn husk. Chile relleno and cauliflower gratin were the best dishes we tried but nothing special. I love coconut cake but Mesa Grill's version didn't have any coconut flavor, it really didn't taste like anything. The ambiance and service get 4 stars, the food 2 stars at best. A huge disappointment. Was it a bad night for the kitchen ? That shouldn't happen at a high caliber restaurant in Las Vegas."

I also order the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which gives you 3 BIG Pork Medallions with an Ancho Chile Sauce and Sweet Potato Tamale! TRUST ME this WILL fill you up! I always order extra Tamale and you HAVE to have the Roasted Corn\nCotija, Cilantro, Lime & Smoked Chile Aioli. BEYOND WORDS! The wine list is extensive and the staff is excellent. If you get the chance have some dessert, be sure to split it with the table as you will fill up quickly on the apps and entrees, and always go with the coffee and zambuca to settle the stomach before you leave!

Got reservation for lunch on Friday lunch and we were seated immediately. Our server James was very professional and recommended what's the signature dishes. I ordered the cocktail Bitter Firenze and my husband ordered the Patida Margarita. Both very good! The bread was very good and different. It has the blue corn bread/muffin and the crusty bead had jalapeno in it. That blue corn bread/muffin just melted in your mouth while the crusty bread had a very good flavor of jalapeno and crispy on the outside and soft inside. \n\nThanks for James's warning that we ordered only 1 appetizer or else we couldn't finish our entree. We ordered the tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale as highly recommended by him. It was just the best tamales I ever had. Very moist and packed with flavor with corn kernels. It had 4 tiger shrimp on top and the creamy cilantro sauce linked the tamales and shrimp very well together.\n\nOur main entrees were here. I had the Pan Seared Halibut and my husband had the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich. The halibut was just cooked perfectly with the new mexico chile and curry sauce which provided a slight kick. The pork tenderloin was to die for. It had the kick from the spices that were on the tenderloin while the ancho chile mayonaise added the heat level. For us both, it was not too spicy, but definitely had the kick. For people that do not eat spicy food, this might be hot for them. The french fries had seasoning on it and we didn't need any ketchup. We had to pass dessert as we were both very stuffed. \n\nHad a wonderful first time experience at Bobby Flay's restaurant! The food definitely made the visit memorable, but the server James had made our visit very enjoyable! Will definitely come back to try their dinner meal soon!"

Once connected, the operator connects me to the restaurant and I request to make reservations for two at 630pm for the following evening. I am now directed to another operator (not Mesa Grill's maybe hotel?) starts with the \"interview\": Are you a hotel guest, do you have a Rewards card, blah, blah, blah. Then the operator asks for my address and Credit Card number!!!! I was informed that I would be charged $50 if I was late or absent for my reservation. When I asked \"what is late?\", the operator's response was,\" if you do not show up at 6pm and they give away your table- one minute or 20 minutes late.\" Are you f*cking kidding me? Before I had to submit my W2 form and personal references, I declined to continue with the reservation process. \n\nAgain, I've dined here so many times and enjoyed every visit but this was enough. Mesa Grill is awesome for the food, but this \"leave a deposit for your reservation\" is ridiculous. We dined at another celebrity chef's restaurant without the hassle.

I've heard Mesa Grill is the place for spice. While none of my dishes have been overly spicy, they have been quite tasty.\n\nThis past visit I tried the Creamy Wild Mushroom Grits w/ Poached Egg. Was the dish outstanding? I wouldn't say it was the best appetizer I've ever had. Were they good grits? They were GREAT grits - in fact the only I've ever liked. So perhaps they weren't traditional grits - if you really love grits you may be disappointed. But now I can technically say I like grits.  Would I get them again? Absolutely. Note the portion is just bit small for sharing than I would like, however.\n\nThis trip, the waitress recommended the Lamb Porterhouse Chops. They were satisfying, but I wasn't blown away so I'd pass next time. I also tried the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which are fantastic and a nice sized portion.\n\nI've had the coffee rubbed filet mignon in the past and that has left me speechless. Fantastic taste and portion. I will definitely be getting that again (that's how I rate my dishes - I won't repeat the same dish unless it blows me away).\n\nI've heard good things about the Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut, which is what I look forward to dropping my fork into next time.

I basically like corn, so getting this taco was a given. \n\nBaby romaine salad ($13), there is nothing that stands out about this salad and tasted generic, so you can save yourself 13 dollars and order something else. \n\nEntrees:\n\nTheir 22 Oz bone in chipotle glazed rib eye ($48) was spot on.  Since it was a large piece of meat,  I opted for well done,  but slightly pink.  This turned out to be amazing. The meat was so soft and tender and it held in the juices and flavor very well. Also, to top it off the red and green chile sauce pairs perfectly with the slightly smoked taste of the meat. \n\nMango tuna steak ($38) is a fun little twist to your average steak. It had fun flavors like peppercorn, and pine nuts, cous cous to top off your steak. Can't go wrong with a little twist if executed right. \n\nDesserts:\n\nBrown butter carrot cake ($11) The cream cheese was so soft and it came with caramelized apples. It wasn't too sweet, but just enough to fulfill a dessert craving.\n\nChurros ($11) come topped with cinnamon sugar and chocolate/coconut caramel dipping sauces. The texture of the churro did taste a little hard, but unsure if it was just that day or that's the nature of how the churro is made."

The salad was okay but nothing exciting. (this was not part of the pre-fixe)\n\nThe dessert was a key lime pie ice cream with two cookies.

For some reasons there is huge quality differences in the dishes.\n\nThe first time I had Pork Tenderloin which was delicious. My girlfriend and son had the Filet Mignon. For sides we had the mashed potatoes and Corn Tamales. Everything was delicious and we were looking forward to going back the next time we were in Vegas.\n\nThe second time as a big disappointment however. This time I had the Grilled Lamb chops, while my family had the Rib Eye steak. The lamb lacked flavor, and the steak as overdone. \n\nI would gladly go back and have what I ate the first time, but would recommend everyone to avoid what we had the second."

C'mon now).  It's inside of Caesar's Palace near the casino area, which was within walking distance from my hotel shuttle's drop off point.  The nice thing about Vegas restaurants is that you have plenty of things to see and do while inside the casinos.\n\nThe prices were not as expensive as I had expected, and the food was just as we expected: yummy and SPICY!  We ordered their queso fundido (a four-cheese dip with chips) and the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale for appetizers.  The cheese dip was delicious!  We devoured it in minutes, and the tiger shrimp tamale was quite tasty.  I was never a big fan of tamales, but the corn meal was actually one of my favorite parts of Bobby Flay's version.  The sauce makes the tamale, so make sure to soak up as much sauce as you can.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Mesa burger, which was pink in the center and super, super juicy throughout.  He gave it two thumbs up.  I went with the spicy scrambled eggs, which had goat cheese and jalapenos in it, with mapled ham.  I was quite fond of the ham, and the eggs had a lovely kick to them.  It was a wee bit too much goat cheese for me, but it's pretty well-known that B.F. loves goat cheese in everything.  Still very good, nonetheless.  My friend Henry went with the Mahi Mahi, which he said was also good.\n\nThe decor is very fun, and our server was informative and polite.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be swinging by again for lunch or dinner."

Dishes are flavorful and fairly bold in their interpretations of classic dishes you may be used to.  One of the early delights is the included bread basket with a lot of tasty choices.  My personal favorite was the blueberry scone and another really interesting bread concoction (not sure if it was a zucchini bread?)  My table ordered a variety of dishes from there (they also have a fairly robust wine list and margarita list as well along with a full bar menu) that ranged from lamb salads to amazing looking waffles.  From the dishes I tried, I surprisingly loved the tiger shrimp tamale the most.  The presentation was not only very well done but the flavors of both the tamale and the well-spiced tiger shrimp hit the spot.   \n\nMy only small complaints were that some of the dishes didn't seem as strong as the others.  The house margarita (I believe called the patrida) was a little more hit-or-miss - not as sweet but not as flavorful as other margaritas I've had either.  The Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash also was a little more on the not-so-sure side.  I liked the presentation but the dish came out a little colder than expected and the sweet potato hash wasn't as flavorful.  Perhaps an off day for the dish?  \n\nService was excellent for sure (friendly, fun and keeping tabs on us regularly) and brunch on a Saturday was surprisingly not that busy.  The decor has a fun fire theme throughout the entire restaurant that goes from the ceilings to the lighting - I really dug the theme.  \n\nAll-in-all, Mesa is a fantastic restaurant stop and the brunch doesn't burn the wallet either.  A worthy check out."

It's bright and colorful, but not obnoxious and has a non intimidating fine dining feel. Food was amazing and very memorable. We came on a Saturday brunch, and they serve traditional American brunch fare with a south-western twist. \n\nWe HAD\n-Complimentary pastries -blue corn bread, mini jalapeno biscuits, coffee cake with butter on the side. Everything was yummy!\n-TIGER SHRIMP TAMALE $18- Everyone's fav so I had to get it. 4 pieces of tiger shrimp on a bed of housemade tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce on top. It was was mix of a bit sweet from the tamale and savory from the shrimp and garlic sauce. Amazing. GET IT! \n-BLUE CORN WAFFLE $14 - Crispy on the outside, light and soft on the inside. The bluecorn gave it a nutty flavor to the waffle. It's different and I liked it. It also had had enough black berry syrup that's not too sweet and the creme fraiche on top to cuts the sweetness. So good!\n-MANGO GLAZED BACON $4.50- Recommended by our server. 2 thick strip of their house cured bacon with mango glaze on top. Wow! never thought of mango with bacon and it's delicious! \n-MESA BURGER $18- Perfectly cooked beef patty, double cheddar and grille onion. So simple yet delicious. It came with southwestern fries (french fries with chili powder) and horseradish mustard dip. GET IT!\n\nService was great. Our server was very nice and attentive. The table next to us was actually very rude to our server, but he remained professional and killed them with kindness.

Even when waiters recommend dishes, I still don't take their word for it unless there are specific things that really stand out.\n\nI decided to go with his second favorite dish, the lamb porterhouse chops.  It cost a whopping $44 but you do get two big chunks - I estimate each to be around 5-6 oz.  They weren't as tender as I had hoped and the glaze is sweet but it doesn't pop out at you.  Now the pork tenderloin is a whole different story; even the one bite of my friends immediately sold me on it and I knew it was the best dish out of all of ours.\n\nI also tried the blue corn pancake, the chicken tacos (this is a special), and the Spanish chorizo quesadilla.  I would say that all this food passes for a middle class restaurant but unlikely as a $30+ per plate LV restaurant.

Naturally, I jumped at the opportunity to eat at Mesa Grill when I recently traveled to Las Vegas. I felt as though by eating at Bobby Flay's restaurant so much of his cooking talent would rub off on me that I would instantly become the next Iron Chef.\n\nThe meal starts off with a basket of bread: a southwestern corn muffin, cheddar jalapeno bread, and cranberry walnut bread. ALL AMAZING. While the muffin fell apart pretty easily, the incredible flavor of the sweet corn with the chiles baked into the bread was unbelievably satisfying. The walnut bread was by far the best, however.\n\nI started my meal with the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido. Forget EVERYTHING YOU EVER THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT QUESO. I feel like after tasting this, no queso will ever quite satisfy me again. The queso is served in a mini cast-iron casserole dish (which I am determined to find and buy and cook with all the time), bubbling and gooey and cheesy and just all-around wonderful. It's topped with red peppers, and green peppers, and onions (my three favorite veggies) and served with blue corn tortilla chip strips. Unbelievable.\n\nFor my main course, I got the Yucatan Chicken Tacos. The ONLY downside to my meal was that I only got three tacos, and I could have easily eaten six. Not only are they tiny, but they are incredibly delicious. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and then grilled (of course, it's Bobby Flay!). Instead of the normal taco-style lettuce, the tacos are served with cilantro and mint. Grilled red onions are also served on the side, and three flour tortillas, which tasted just like what I assume my Mexican grandmother's tortillas would taste like (if I had a Mexican grandmother...). Top it all off with a little of the chile-peanut BBQ sauce, and you've got the best chicken tacos I've ever had. It's a do-it-yourself dish that requires you to build the tacos yourself, but that madeit even more awesome, because then I felt like I was cooking with Bobby Flay (don't judge me...).\n\nI did not have the dessert, because I ran out of money :( I could only assume that had I tried the dessert, I would have never wanted to leave.\n\nBobby Flay, you are a GOD."

Bobby Flay, eh, names don't impress me, but good food and good reviews do.\n\nWe went in without reservations just before 5pm. The place was pretty empty, yet the hostess said it would be a 25 minute wait. We couldn't wait - had to eat and get over to TI for the Cirque show. So we opted to eat at the bar.\n\nHubby had the Mango + Spice crusted Tuna steak. I tried a bite - it was okay, but couldn't hold a candle to my meal. I got the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. Gotta give this dish 5 stars - this was probably the best pork I've had in my life. It was spicy but not over the top, full of flavor, juicy, and the sweet tamale it was served with was a perfect companion to offset the heat. I think they should rename it Perfection on a Plate. Or Porkfection...no, wait, that doesn't sound so good. Anyway, if you go here, ORDER THE PORK.\n\nWe did not receive a bread basket full of goodies, so I'm knocking off a star. The bartender was super nice and she made a killer Lemon Drop. It was pretty pricy for what you get, so I'm not sure we'll go back. There are so many restaurants in Vegas to choose from, and I haven't even scratched the surface. But the pork tenderloin will remain a good memory."

The bread selection (yes there was a selection of three different breads) was great - jalapeno asiago bread was a big A+ for me.\n\nMy entree was the grilled mahi mahi - and it was PERFECT, just a little heat, so much flavor it was a party in my mouth that I didn't want to have end.\n\nIf you are on the strip you have to go here."

So when I was searching for restaurants in Vegas, I came to the realization that I should tell others what happened.\n\nThe food was \"ok\" but nothing spectacular. I would eat there again if I wasn't paying the bill. I found it really expensive as is most of Vegas.  I wind up renting a 10 dollar a day car and driving myself to restaurants in the remote parts of town where the locals eat.  Better food, service and value overall and i have been to vegas 5-6 times per year.\n\nThe real piss off is the $50.00 per head no show fee.  Get this. They charged my friend's charge card $300.00 for a no show and we DID show. The food went on my card, so they must do a computer matching and did not find a bill under the same name as the reservation.  They would NOT remove it for months.The were not apologetic or anyhing.  We had to fight with them and I had to fax her my receipt to her town (across the country) while she battled this.  I was so embarassed that my good act (to put the tab on my card) was such a debacle. \n\nWith all the fancy food techniques I would think a few classes in civility and restaurant management would be better suited for this place."

I like watching food network and I Bobby Flay always tries to bring the heat. bring the flavor.  Bobby Flay, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this restaurant.  We were seated to our table, and our waiter came out to speed read us our menu and his recommendations.  I started with a bloody and when my wife stated that water was all she wanted, the waited ignored her and showed her the drink menu, gave more opinions of what he would have etc etc.  When she reiterated that all she wanted was water, he glared, yes folks, glared and walked away.  So our food came out real fast... too fast... As in yeah we had this made already and just warmed it up a touch.  I don't need my food made from scratch each and every time, I just don't want it to taste like it was made days ago and reheated.  So I had the  Mesa burger. Double cheddar cheese. Grilled Vidalia onion. Horseradish mustard.  Asked for medium rare/medium.  got medium well/well.  if you are going to ask me how I want it cooked you should try to adhere to that level of \"cookedness\" ;-)  The burger was lack luster from bun to burger to onion to my mouth.  Nothing about this burger was good aside from the horseradish mustard, which had a nice kick.  If I wanted a mediocre burger I would go to applebee's or something like that.  At least there I would not be let down with a bad tasting burger, I would expect it.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale is what my wife had.  Oh course I ate some too, sharing is caring.  We agreed that the shrimp was overcooked.  I think that this dish would have been pretty good if the shrimp was not overcooked.  It surely had the potential.  The tamale was great, soft moist flavorful.  No wonder this dish has been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. So overall this place was a let down.  I was looking for flavor and heat, really did not get any of that here.  I was so rushed through my meal and my waiter was so rude that it made me feel like I was at a fast food restaurant.  It seemed, however just an assumption, that once we declared only one cocktail per our table, hey we drank all day gambling and needed a break, it felt like the waiter saw us as a low profit table, and treated us thus.  Really wanted to like this place. ;-("

For drinks, we ordered the white peach margarita per our waitress's recommendation. I typically like my margaritas original (with lim\u00f3n) but this was good. For our main entree I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi and my bf ordered the Salmon. We were both very satisfied. They also offer 3 different types of bread - all good - my favorite has to be the jalape\u00f1o bread though. I didn't find our dishes to be spicy at all but they were very well executed.

They were very specific to tell me that if I did not show up or cancelled less than 8 hours prior I would be charged $100 ($50 for every person in my party). Wow! This must mean they are so super packed and busy they cannot afford even one cancellation since that is one extra table they turned away. Hmmm, was that the case?? I showed up at 8:15 on the dizot. Hi Mr. Lovil, please have a seat while we prepare your table. Okay I said and I sat with my lovely wife, and waited and waited. It was about 8:45 when I was retrieved to sit. Funny thing was there were plenty of open tables and no one cared when I asked why it took so long. We were seated at a small two person table, okay makes sense we are a party of two. I don't care for the seating arrangement however that places you directly next to another couple trying to have a nice night out. Regardless let's start the service, after poring over the wine list I chose a nice white, eh, or not so nice. The bottle was open, it would have been nice to have a sip of the Francois Pinon but they just poured it. I can however vouche for the wine pourer since I could over hear her speaking to her many friends working at the bar and those friends who were seated at the bar. Apparently she was having a bad day and took it out on the patrons. Sorry to hear about your school issues by the way, hope you get them resolved, sorry to have eavesdropped, it was the 30 minute wait, I needed entertainment. Bread took forever to arrive, it was okay, not great but just bread, what do you expect. We got the Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla which we loved. It was interesting and different and very flavorful, I'd say get it. Also got the pork tenderloin and hacked chicken, again we thought they were excellent. The tamale that comes with the pork is excellent, the tomatillo tamale on the chicken was only so so. We ordered way too much in terms of getting 2 sides with our meal, the corn and the spinach. The corn is phenomenal, if you even remotely like corn you need to get this, it is excellent. The sauteed spinach not so much. They did not season it even slightly, not sure why. Due to this we could not fathom getting dessert and skipped it however it sounded good. Overall the food tasted very good, the service was slow and very disappointing for the amount of money being spent. I don't think I need to go back which I find disappointing."

The waiter (more on him in a bit) strongly recommended the spicy chicken + sweet potato hash, which I would only recommend if you like eating baby food. While the presentation and flavors were all there, the hash was more of a mash and when you combine that with really tender chicken, you get mush. The creamy grits were a winner, but I really regret pairing that with the mushy chicken/hash. A little bit of textural contrast may have made this good. Well, at least I left full.\n\nGood service might have made this a better experience, but the waiter was too much of a salesman. I'm not sure I've ever had a waiter try to push certain dishes so hard, it seemed as if he wanted to order our meals for us. From this single sampling, I'd say that Mesa Grill does not live up to the Bobby Flay hype."

Yes - Mesa has Pappy Van Winkle, which for bourbon connoisseurs is like drinking a unicorn.\n\nWe were lucky enough to be here for Restaurant Week, which meant we got a 3 course meal for $50. Not cheap, but honestly not bad compared to the rest of the high end strip restaurants. The chicken taco appetizer was nice and spicy and had a zesty little sauce. I went with the pork tenderloin for the main course. Good Lord. It's as tender and juicy as a filet, but the flavors are so bold and out of bounds. Insane. \n\nDessert was just as amazing and unique - chocolate and caramel salted pudding. WOW. Just the right balance of sweet and salty. \n\nBottom line: If you're a Karl Welzein bold flavors man from way back, Mesa is a must."

He's not a \"celebrity chef\" with a tv personality but mediocre culinary skills - he's the real deal. First, the service was impeccable. We were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess and every need we could have had was anticipated and catered to by our waiter and sommellier. Second, the setting was very warm and open (this is the type of place where one is made to feel welcome whether he is wearing jeans or a three piece suit). Third, and most important, the food was delicious. Between my friend and I, we had the Baby Romaine Salad, Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon (to die for), New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Mashed Potatoes with Green Chile Queso Sauce (another favorite), Fresh Corn Tamales, and Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. Every bit of the meal was delicious and I truly couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. While this restaurant is a little pricey, it is definitely worth the money and I promise you will leave very satisfied."

Note: a credit card is required to hold a reservation, and if you miss your time slot, they *will* charge it. \n\nAppetizers I've had:\nGOAT CHEESE \"QUESO FUNDIDO\" - sinful and delicious. Warm goat cheese dip accompanied by a carb of sorts.\nSMOKED CHICKEN + BLACK BEAN QUESADILLA - like Taco Bell on steroids. Bursting with flavor, sets the tone for what is bound to be an incredible dining experience.\nTIGER SHRIMP+ ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE - delicious, but some entrees are served with a tamale, so make sure you don't overload yourself on this app/side.\n\nEntrees I've had:\nNEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN - served with a sweet potatoe tamale. It was great, but with each bite of pork, I wished I was eating a steak. \nBLACK ANGUS NEW YORK STRIP STEAK - that's the goodness right there. It's nothing like a steakhouse flavor-wise; quality-wise, sure. But this is a steak prepared in a way you've never experienced, totally mindblowing flavor palette. Order medium rare for the optimal texture.\n\nSides I've had:\nMASHED POTATOES: a must with steak/meat dishes\nCREAMED CORN: amazing flavor, but not seeing it on their menu online. Hope they didn't get rid of it.\n\nDesserts I've had:\nCHURROS - traditional cinnamon, warm churro served with hot chocolate dipping sauce. So authentic and fun to eat. It's nice to know they don't just slap \"Chocolate Lava Cake\" on the dessert list like everyone else and call it a day.\n\nService:\nIt's what you'd expect from a restaurant of its calibur, but it's nothing super noteworthy, unfortunately - but what is in Vegas? The hostesses are Vegas snobs for the most part, sorry to say. And even if you have a reservation, you will likely find your party waiting at least 10 minutes to be sat. \n\nEnjoy!!"

Prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. Cactus pear iced tea is a must; I probably go through a whole pitcher :P \nFor shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the smoked salmon quesadilla.  Bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. For entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - spicy chicken sweet potato hash, chilequiles, salmon. Grits and the bacon are favorite sides. I'd say skip the tenderloin sandwich (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. Steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. Salmon is another great treat! Also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert."

I was really disapointed my the lobster tacos, first they are one bit, literally.  At least you get 3 but still for $15 I wanted more than 3 bites.  Also, I couldnt taste the lobster, there was way too much going on in that little taco!  The duck pancake was very flavorful and the sauce was delicious.

On the other hand, I really like southwestern style food, and he's supposedly good at coming up with versions of it. \n\nSo there we were, my boyfriend and I, in Vegas a little earlier than expected because we made most of the drive ahead of time to avoid a snowstorm. In fact, we were here in time for lunch (instead of just to St. George). We couldn't decide what to do with our extra meal, so we moseyed into Caesar's and were greeted by the Mesa Grill. We were curious, so we went in. \n\nIt was Saturday afternoon, and therefore brunch time, so my boyfriend started with a mimosa. However, I couldn't resist our waiter's suggestion of one of the margaritas. I can't remember what they called it, but it was as smooth as he said it was supposed to be. I don't usually like margaritas, but I was down with this. \n\nFor our entrees, Alan got the Spicy Scrambled Eggs and I got the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad. Both were very good. The chicken in the salad was perfectly seasoned, and the dressing and goat cheese complimented it nicely. The eggs also had a good amount of goat cheese, and the combination of spices gave a great unique flavor. The ham the accompanied the dish was probably the highlight, though. \n\nService was pretty slow, but our waiter was very nice when he did come by. Prices were high, but it's Vegas. \n\nI guess I'll forgive Bobby Flay for his Iron Chef ills for now (it's been long enough, right?), and I'll even go as far to say that I'd love to try this place for dinner sometime."

But it was worth it!!\n\nFor starters, we had cocktails at the bar. The bar menu didn't list all their beers, just the imported foo-foo ones which had my husband scratching his head until the bartender told him the domestic beers weren't listed but they do serve them. I started off with their hot-pink cactus-pear margarita...it was fresh, tangy and just mouth-watering! Could I say, THEE best margarita I've ever tasted? I proceeded to throw back two more during dinner.\n\nAppetizers: Yucatan Chicken Tacos - Absolutely delicious! The Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce was reminiscent of Pad Thai Sauce...after the tacos were done, my husband sopped up the remaining sauce with the YUMMY dinner rolls...Overall, I highly recommend you try them!\n\nOur waiter was awesome! The customer service at MESA was just as good as the food. I had on a black dress and the server returned back with a black napkin so the white fibers wouldn't get on my dress (I mean really? This ol' thang?!). He did the same for my husband as well. It was a fairly busy Saturday night and he made sure he was readily available to us. Huge Plus for me :)\n\nDinner Entrees: I have been dying to try their pork tenderloin since I had seen so many reviews gushing about them. I don't usually eat pork so I chickened out at the last second and got the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. Once again, I fell in love with the sauce, Carrot-Habanero Sauce. It complimented the meat beautifully! There was a side of the Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale and it melted in my mouth. The dish was awesome....however, halfway through the dish...my husband and I split...to truly appreciate the dishes :) As soon as I tasted the Pork Tenderloin, I felt an orgasm in my mouth. I kid you not. That dish was as perfect as it could get.\n\nDessert: We were so full after that but my taste buds couldn't get enough. We ordered dessert to get the full experience. We ordered the Cafe con Leche Flan (Espresso Caramel) and it was so light and perfectly sweet. A calm ending to an overall amazing dinner.\n\nMUSTS:\n- Cactus-Pear Margarita\n- Yucatan Chicken Tacos\n- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin\n\nBUSTS:\n- Wow...none huh? I was in heaven...MESA is the reason I created a yelp ha"

We got 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, the app portions are small while the entr\u00e9e portions are decent, so that was a perfect amount of food for 2 people. The lobster tacos are super small, no more than 2 inches long, it's amazing how much flavor can be packed into these tiny little things. Also go the blue corn pancake (thin like a crepe) with duck breast, sweet and tangy with just enough heat, there's some Asian fusion flavors mixed in there that I love. For entrees we got their signature pork tenderloin and coffee rubbed filet mignon. The beef was cooked to perfection! I have a weakness for the perfect steak, but I never knew pork can be so tender at medium too! It was amazing, both dishes were about equal in flavor, a little bit of heat, which is balanced out with the side of sweet corn tamale. Definitely coming back here next time!"

They put us down for 6:00.  Of course, the traffic was horrible, so I called back and asked if we could change our reservation.  They informed me that since I didn't secure our reservation with a credit card that we, in fact, didn't have one.  The person I spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude. She proceeded to argue with me about whether or not I had a reservation till finally I asked if I could just, please, make one.  I made the new reservation for 6:30 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.  Then when we arrived at the restaurant the Hostess, rudely, told me that we didn't have a reservation, she was adamant about this, till I pointed at my name, written down on her sheet next to \"6:30\".\n\nI had a beer (corona or tecate?), the Lobster Tacos (appetizer), and the sesame crusted ahi.

Living it up in true Vegas style, margaritas were in order. Ultimate = a simple original favorite. White peach = excellent and refreshing. Pear = way too strong, and why was it hot pink? Everything about this place is vividly bold and colorful. The contemporary decor, the presentation of each dish, and even the drinks. \n\nBobby's famous blue corn pancake w/ bbq'd duck is a must have. The habanero chili and star anise sauce add a savory sweet kick to each bite. The duck was well cooked and tender, and although a mess to eat, no scraps were left behind. Chorizo quesadilla w/ fried egg was also a delicious starter. Oozing yolk blended with habanero sauce and grated parmesan over a crisp crust never tasted so heavenly.\n\nWith my heart set on the spicy chicken & sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it would be good. Two whopping mounds of poached eggs ridiculously drenched in green hollandaise and habanero sauce (notice the pattern?) set before my eyes as I wiped a little bit of drool off my face. I can't recall any other time I've experience such explosive flavors all at once. This dish is a bit on the heavy side, so don't hesitate loosening up a notch on the ol' belt loop. The jumbo lump crab cake isn't on the regular menu, but we were lucky enough to catch a taste of it off the lunch prix fixe. Complemented by a blanket of corn relish and pablano vinaigrette, it would be a shame not to permanently include this on the menu. Typically, crab cakes are made small in size, but this one was considerably well portioned. Definitely one of my more meatier crab cakes I've ever seen. Ended the meal with a dark chocolate creme brulee and pineapple upside down cake w/ caramelized rum, which were both a delightful treat.\n\nPrices are reasonable, but tend to add up quickly. But hey, it's Vegas after all. Planning to check out the dinner menu on my next visit to try the pork tenderloin everyone's been raving about."

Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the bar and order appetizers. Thankfully there was no wait. \n\nBread Basket -- complimentary warm bread basket while you wait. The corn muffin is to die for!\n\nShrimp Tamale -- One of their signature dishes, and its a must. I love tamales, and Bobby Flay has definitely raised the bar with this appetizer. I can see why it was listed on Food Networks \"Best Thing I've Ever Eaten\"\n\nTuna Nachos -- Thankfully there is no cheese on these nachos. It is sashimi served with a couple different sauce with chips to scoop. Good light appetizer with a lot of flavor. \n\nWhite Peach Margarita -- Excellent margarita with high quality alcohol. No syrups were used while making this cocktail, and it gave me a good buzz just after one cocktail.\n\nOverall it was an awesome dining experience -- job well done Bobby Flay!"

The restaurant is beautiful and very clean, they layout fresh linens after tables clear. We ordered our meal and told the server that we would be sharing our meals with each other. He brought us extra plates and when our Filet came out they had cut it in half for us. Food was amazing! We had the Sophie's Chopped Salad, the Chili Relleno, and the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon. We also part took in the libations. I had the Saratoga and my sis got the Mesa Grill Margarita, both were well rounded drinks made with excellent liquor. \nGood Job Bobby Flay! One of our new favorites in Las Vegas."

The decor was inviting and the ambience stylish and warm (see our picture).\n\nHaving gotten to know Bobby Flay's personality through watching him on the Food Network, it was pleasantly surprising to see that his staff embodies this warm personality too. \n\nOur waitress reviewed the menu with us and explained some of Bobby's signature dishes as well as making some recommendations.\n\nWhile we perused the menu, the flavorful basket of mini cornbreads and assorted small pastries was brought out to our table as were our drinks (Cactus pear iced tea, cofee and Margarita).\n\nAppetizers our party of 4 shared:\n*Goat cheese \"Queso Fundido\" with blue corn tortilla chips - the flavor of the goat cheese dip topped with roasted peppers so full of robust rustic flavor - a solid 5 Stars! \n*Shrimp and sweet corn tamale -Bobby Flay's signature dish. Well balanced flavors, shrimp was cooked to perfection - another 5 star dish. Though the dish comes with 4 large tiger shrimp it would serve as a good appetizer for 2 instead of 4.\n\nEntrees - our waitress let us know how these were going to be cooked and at what temperature to expect them so we wouldn't have any surprises.\n*Spicy Scrambled Eggs - served with Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese, Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham and Buttermilk Biscuits - very good flavors.\n*Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash served with Poached Eggs & Green Chile Hollandaise - this flavor profile was very delicious \n*Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce\nCaramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa & Creamy Green Chile Rice - perfect balance of bright flavors and texture. The Cascabel chile sauce was so good I used the little cornbreads to dip and polish it off my plate!\n*New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise & Southwestern Fries - fantastic flavor and the southwestern fries were warm and crispy- not oily at all.\n\nThe portions were perfectly sized for brunch but we all agreed we could have eaten more of every dish that we had ordered as every bite was a burst of delicious flavor that tantalized our taste buds.\n\nThe service was attentive without being obtrusive. The waitress was knowledgeable and made good recommendations. They have an extensive Margarita menu and the one I had was fantastic.\n\nWe added pictures of the food we ordered and I made everyone wait to eat so that I could take some good pictures so make sure to check them out.\n \nWe will be definitely coming back here to try their other dishes."

I was looking for any crack in the hull to sink Mesa Grill's ship but I simply couldn't find one.\n\nScurrying through the dining area, I peered through the big kitchen windows to see if Flay was in the house (and he wasn't).  I loved that the place was relatively casual, and not pretentious.  Decor was simple, nothing to really distract you away from your meal.  The wait staff was attentive, informed, friendly, and even precognitive a couple times!\n\nChimay is on the beer list, causing my eyes to well up in sheer joy.  We shared the shrimp tamale signature dish, which was impossibly bold and delicate at the same time.  My lamb porterhouse chops with chimichurri sauce were great, nicely medium rare, seasoned well.  The sauce was well executed though I must say the chops didn't taste as good after I tried EZ-P's signature pork dish which was extraterrestrial far as flavors go.  I will be back and I will have that dish then.  Ehh, what the hell, you had me at Chimay...\n\nI would've loved to see Flay fall on his face, but dammit, I guess not this time!"

I thoroughly enjoyed the tiger prawns, roasted garlic tamale, and cilantro sauce.\n\nThe food was amazing at the tables on either side of us as well - we could hear them exclaiming about it!  \n\nAs good as the food was - the service managed to equal it.  I've never had my water refilled so often, the waitress be so knowledgable (we had wine questions), or the bus boys be so efficient.  Amazing, and all without ever feeling like someone was hovering over our table.\n\nGo to the Mesa Grill.

Not that this necessarily makes everything spicy, but you should know in case you have a pepper or spice aversion. I arrived late one evening to Vegas and after checking in to my room at Caesar's Palace I decided 1, I needed dinner and 2, I didn't want to go far so Mesa Grill answered my needs.\n\nI've said it before but I'll say it again so no one thinks I ate all this food by myself - I'm a sharer so when I go anywhere I like to order lots of stuff and share it with my dining partners. With this in mind we started with a Caesar type salad that came with chorizo as the meat and it was definitely an interesting take on this basic starter. One that I definitely enjoyed. We then ordered the black bean soup, grits with poached egg, and the pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale as our main course to sample.\n\nThe black bean soup had just the right amount of spice to it and so I slurped most of it up. The pork tenderloin was indeed tender and the sweet potato tamale that accompanied it was amazingly good. But, the real highlight of the meal was the grits topped with a poached egg. Coming from the South I've had my fair share of grits, sometimes they are made sweet with butter and sugar, sometimes they are made savory with spices and bacon, but I'm going to start suggesting they always come this way from now on. It was an item of food that would be just as comfortable at breakfast as it was at dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\nOur service was also marvelous, the man who served us told us he'd been with the restaurant since they opened and his expertise in suggesting certainly made it seem so."

It was just tequila, and a squeeze of lime (no triple sec or other crap to water it down).  Just divine!

Personally, I prefer a little less liquid, so its not soupy at the bottom, but the flavor was on point\n8) Layered Coconut Cake - Super light and coconutty =)\n\nAll in all, a delicious meal!

I've worked in restaurants for years and I know it can be stressful and people ask you to move mountains sometimes but I was just trying to add 2 people to our party and try and keep the reservation time as close to what it had been as possible. When I was told we'd need to come an extra hour later I needed to check with everyone first so I said I'd call back in a couple minutes. I called back using the same number 2 minutes later and the concierge said I didn't need to be transferred back and that they would move the reservation. \n\nSpeed forward to 8:45 and the hostess finds our reservation moved but only for 4 people not 6. She IMMEDIATELY cops an attitude and tells me that she remembers my call and she knows that I needed a table for 6 not the reserved 4 and I can't just show up expecting them to add people AND she specifically told me I'd have to change the reservation to a later time...which I had done. I felt it necessary to point out to her that why would I have moved the res. an hour later if I was keeping the original party size. I was then told that the concierge isn't able to change reservations and I should called her back... I had tried to do just that and was told by the concierge they were capable. \n\nLong story slightly shorter this hostess was a total bitch and could use a lesson in customer service.  The customer isn't always right, but drop the attitude until you know you're right, ok? \n\nThis whole experience really put me off of Mesa Grill especially after I ate later that week next door at Old Homestead and it was AMAZING. I'll spend my money where I'm getting the total package and not somewhere I'm getting the stink eye from some stuck up 20something"

Being a big lover of good cioppino the green pepper base really intrigued me, venturing out of the traditional tomato base, and it was brilliant! I do not know how to describe it without not doing it justice so I will just say go eat it, it is the best cioppino I have ever had, the fish, scallops, and lobster that were in it were cooked perfectly and the green pepper broth was so delicious, so so delicious!

I'm sure everyone out there knows this by now (but if not) Pork Tenderloin is leaner than chicken breast. Yes, that's right, it's diet food. My only compaint from last week was the pork was undercooked. They did not ask how we wanted it cooked and I didn't think to request it as I thought Pork was 'well done' by default? I guess that's not true anymore, so next time I'll be sure to request well done. This is the first time I didn't clear my plate.

Mr. Flay, my humble apology.  You may be a turd on TV, but you have a great restaurant and I've been back multiple times with guests.\n\nThe vibe is cool.  Just enough isolation from the casino floor to make dining intimate, but a sweeping and impressive view of the sports book in the background that looks like NASA's mission control.  The tuna nachos and the duck laden Blue corn pancakes are fabulous.  The pork loin and the filet are both must haves as is the side dish of chorizo-feta tamales.  Service has always been punctual, but nonintrusive, that's professionalism.  I've always been accommodated for a late notice reservation, even during hectic CES.  My only, purely selfish, complaint is that you no longer offer those truly wonderful caipirinhas.  Maybe something to reconsider?

Pork was seasoned well but the sweet sauce was a overpowering all the other nice flavors. Filet mignon was perfect and the coffee rub was very good. Brussel sprout side dish was amazing, and no sweet sauce anywhere. Banana cream pie dessert was very good with the banana cream unlike any other. Overall, the sweet sauces could be tempered to allow other flavors to shine. Service was excellent so 4 stars with the only setback being the sweet sauces for the tenderloin and duck."

It's perfect in size so you won't end up taking a nap after lunch. Cooked to a perfect temp. with melted cheese, green chiles, cilantro, and the best tasting red onions I have found on a burger today. While Caesars has since opened their new food court and managed to stuff a smash burger in there I still think it's worth the wait and not much more money to sit down and enjoy one of bobby flays burgers."

            "review": "We dined here last night for my boyfriend's birthday. The food was delicious! Bobby Flay created a delicious menu. The Fundido and lobster tacos were awesome appetizers. For dinner, we enjoyed the rabbit and tuna. Lastly, we loved the coconut layered cake for dessert! The food runners and table assistants were extremely friendly (more than any other staff)! \n\nI was super disappointed by the front of the house, especially the hostesses. When we arrived the hostesses did not greet us, nor bid a farewell as we left the restaurant. I don't think I actually saw any of them smile the entire time we were at the restaurant. \n\nI initially made our reservation on Open Table for 5 people. I called on Thursday to update our reservation to 6 people and I was connected to the main Luxor reservations desk. The Luxor employee was very friendly. She stated she was unable to update the party number on the reservation but she added a note for the hostess to update the reservation. She gave me the number to call Mesa Grill directly to make sure they got the note and the reservation was correct. I called Mesa Grill on Friday 4/9/15 in the afternoon. The hostess was extremely rude and unprofessional. She indicated that my reservation was for 5 people and acted irritated when I asked her to update it to 6 people. I explained how I had been previously connected to the Luxor's reservations line, etc. and she didn't seem to care. The hostess then rudely stated \"the table only holds 6 people so we cannot add anymore people onto the table\". How she knew what table we were sitting at more than 24 hours away is beyond me. Finally, we arrived and were seated at a table with EIGHT seats (annoying).\n\nAnother flaw of the restaurant is there is absolutely NO seating for guests to wait for their table. We arrived on time but were told we could not be seated until our entire party had arrived? Luckily, another guest was kind enough to share their booth in the bar area for our elderly grandparents to sit while we waited."

We got so much food I can't describe it all. The lamb on the lamb salad was perfectly cooked and tender, although the salad could have used a little more. Burgers are good. I enjoyed my sword fish club but the bread choice was not my favorite. I'll go back to try more of the flavorful menu. Southwestern fries disappointed a little, I was expecting more flavor from them. \n\nMEN: you can't wear hats in the dining room FYI"

I almost always order the Coffee rubbed fillet and typically some sort of starter (I saw a few people on yelp  complained about the tiger shrimp tamales but I have always found them to be quite good). Also the bread basket is YUMMY! Sour dough, tomato  and Corn bread oh my! Todo we are deeeefinately not in Kansas anymore!  \n\nJust one word to the wise... This is not your typical \"Tex Mex\" restaurant. Sure i SUPPOSE it does have Mexican flavors and some Texan influence. But, you will not be getting refried beans, chili con queso and 5 dollars nachos.  After all people.. This is a Bobby Flay dining experience and he would NEVER allow such typical dishes that lack innovation. \n\nIn short, yessss i am a fan. My favorite restaurant in the world? No... But still one i go back to over and over again. If you are a foodie, this is 100 percent worth at least a meal or two."

I didn't think they could be exceeded, but the food was a total oralgasm.  The skilled craftsmanship of bold flavors balanced against subtle undertones and lingering aftertastes is absolutely incomparable to anything else I've ever experienced in food.  Damn this man knows how to make an amazing flavor combination!!\n\nNeedless to say- the food was absolutely amazing.  The service was even quite impeccable on the day that we went.  The food, while crafty and artistic, was highly understandable and accessible since it played off of American classics.\n\nLast but not least, the decor was crafted just as carefully as the food, blending natural woods and metals into a textural and visual gestalt of sensory pleasure.  I make it a point to visit this restaurant almost every time I'm in Vegas... I can never get enough and I dream about the next time I get to enjoy it again!"

They gave me a knife to cut it...I didn't need it. Perfectly cooked. \n3: Tiger Shrimp Tamale - Again, believe the reviews. It's as good as everyone says and the positive reviews are earned. \n4: Brussel Sprouts w/ Roasted Pecans: Never had anything like it, loved it. \n5: Toffee Pudding - OMG!

The colored dots on the glass were stickers. The multicolored glass containers above the bar...looked like cheap plastic up close. \nAttention to Detail: Chipped Plates. Seriously. In a restaurant like Mesa this was unacceptable. \nService: The staff at the Front Counter seemed a bit clueless and lost. Complete opposite experience of the over the top service we had once we were seated. \nSpace: Looks like Harrah's / Caesar's Palace is trying to extract maximum revenue per square foot with tables that are very tightly spaced. If anyone in your party is claustrophobic or more than average sized, this will not be a positive experience for them. \nRoasted Garlic Corn Tamale - Kind of a letdown, but fortunately the other menu items more than offset this slightly bland disappointment. \n\nPricing: Bring Ben and make sure he's got a twin when you pay and tip appropriately. And we won't even discuss the tab if you really explore the bar. \nWould we go back? In a heartbeat. If I didn't have so many cons I'd give that 5th star, but 4 will have to suffice. \n\nOne other thing: Caesars's Valet Parking was \"Full\" but explaining we were late for our reservations and a generous tip took care of the parking. Needless to say we tipped them again on the way out because they the valet staff took great care of us."

The food was just what we hoped for: bold flavors in the southwestern family with little \"wow\" touches.  Celebrity chef restaurants get some flack since the standards are so high and everyone likes to poke holes in them, but I have to say that we had a fantastic meal. \n\nWe started with the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla, which was the best quesadilla we've ever had (sorry reviewer Jen Y!).  The quesadilla itself is quite tasty with a great cheesy, smoky filling, but the toasted garlic creme fraiche was amazing.  Even better were the little slivers of fried garlic.  They were crispy and awesome.  I'd love to have a bowlful of those - you'd have bad breath for about a month, but it would be worth it!\n\nFor our entrees, I had ancho chile-honey glazed salmon and my wife had the Yucatan chicken tacos.  The salmon was perfectly cooked with a wonderfully sweet-spicy-smoky glaze, and the sauces that came along with it were simply divine. One order of fried garlic chips and jalapeno  crema, please!  The Yucatan chicken tacos were also delicious with a fantastic, with the roasted peanut barbecue sauce being a pleasant diversion from the usual barbecue sauce flavors.  \n\nFor dessert, I highly suggest the sampling plate so you don't have to make up your mind.  All three on the plate were excellent, but the warm chocolate cake was my favorite."

The extra thin crispy tortilla smothered with smoked chicken pieces and soft beans. On top of the quesadilla, there was a nice smoked paprika, with some avocado crema to balance the texture out. BAM, this was by far just the perfect way to start off our meal! I mean of course, the bread basket was everything as well. \n\npork loin sandwich- everything down from the bread, to the soft tender pork loin to even the freshly made fries.

The tender pork was so soft and flavorful; it had a nice smoky chipotle flavor to it. \n\nsweet potato hash w/ spicy chicken- Who would have thought sweet potatoes and eggs could mesh? The sweetness from the potatoes, the creaminess from the egg and the  smokiness from the chicken.

The server asked how much pink I liked in the burger and it came out cooked perfectly.  The horseradish mustard and grilled onions worked well together, and the southwestern fries were solid, soft and somewhat reminiscent (although not as good as) the fries at Five Guys.

Not too sickly sweet. Everything on the menu looked so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter excellently described the use of heat and mentioned his favorites on the menu. I chose the mango crusted tuna steak with walnut cous cous and green chile sauce and it was excellent. The cous cous had a great nutty flavor that complimented the mango and green chile. The lady next to us complained that it was 'over the top salty' but she was off her rocker :)\n\nMy friend had the duck breast which was also very good. We had an excellent meal and I would most definitely go back. The only downside was that our waiter seemed as if he was annoyed and it was a pain to come back and check on us. We still left over a 20% tip as we are in the industry, but would have left more if he didn't disregard us immediately because we were young."

That night we were served blue corn cornbread muffins, asiago cheese bread (somewhat like sourdough, perfect crust & cheesy flavor), and jalepeno cheddar bread (a hint of spice and lots of flavor).\n\nAppetizers\nQueso Fundido\nYUM! Made with goat cheese, so it was little on the sharp side, but man oh man-- it was addicting.\n\nTiger Shrimp + corn tamale\nIt was a meal on its own!! I loved this dish and wanted to steal it from my friend. The shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tamale was slightly sweet and the spicy, creamy sauces were perfect for the dish. I crave this.\n\n16-Spice Chicken\nThe juiciest, flavorful chicken that I have ever ordered at a restaurant. Amazing. I'm usually a steak person, but I had the urge to order something less filling (so I wouldn't feel like a heffer at the club afterwards). The herb mashed potatoes were creamy, not too buttery, which was amazing with the crisp chicken skin. The cilantro sauce was just right- not too strong, and complimented the spices on the skin. I loved this dish and would recommend it.\n\nMy friends ordered the ribeye, pork tenderloin, and venison-- I tried a bite of each, but I don't think it's enough to judge the entire dish. They were all tasty though, nothing bad to say. Love this restaurant though and I'm not even a huge Bobby Flay fan. He won me over and I'll be going back to Mesa next time I'm in Vegas.\n\nSide note: The water guy was a ninja!!! He was on top of his game and we were really impressed!!

I've only been here twice, but the fact that I went back at all considering the fact that there are so many restaurants in Vegas to still try is something. My first time here I was pleasantly surprised. I like things simple. real simple, so when I saw the menu I freaked. This place is not simple. But I am getting ahead of myself here. Lets talk about walking in. My little brother and are look the same age despite the 4 years age difference, we look 17. SO imagine the look of disdain of the hostess seeing who their 9 pm reservation was for. We were told to wait (stand by the door) for 15 minutes with reservation at 9pm. Then we were led to a complete bs table. We ordered drinks. I was still under 21 order roy rogers ya just get me my drink and be gone. They thought we were cheap, and then we ordered. My brother had the duck pancake, I had the ahi tuna... appetizers. We split a salad... veggies. He had the coffee glazed steak, I had the pork tenderloin something.... main course. I had coffee, he had espresso... warm up. He had something delish for dessert and I had small scoop of ice cream... I was full. \n The bill was close to 3, without tip. do not ever underestimate age. I gave a fatty tip... yes our parents paid but still. \n I like this place. Even though we were dressed slummy and we looked young the waiter was kind enough to answer all of my questions. (simple food gal)  The food was spectacular and made me think of nothing else for the next three months till we were back. My second time here was still good, but something went awry. I got deathly sick later that night. So sick that I cannot even bear to go back.  But still I have fond memories of this place."

My past two experiences here were five-star but tonight I rate it four for two reasons: 1. when we arrived the hostess was unfriendly and appeared put off that we were there. We had an 8:00 reservation and checked in at 7:45 and were told to \"try coming back closer to your 8:00 reservation time.\" Definitely not a good idea to have that reception be your customer's first impression. 2. I asked for the salmon well-done and it arrived rare. I know medium to rare is the desired temp but I'm paying $32 and should get it the way I prefer. We also had the pork tenderloin, never a wrong choice. Don't pass on the coconut layer cake. We were seated at a small table right on the main walkway; good for looking into the kitchen, but awful for all the patrons passing by. Our server, Joel was friendly and very attentive, making our seating situation tolerable. If not for the pork, coconut cake, and Joel I would have rated this two stars."

We came to Vegas for our honeymoon and my husband knew I HAD to go to a Bobby Flay eatery. \n\nWhat a friggin bust! \nFirst off, I, the giddy school girl inside, came right out and asked if Mr Flay was there (obviously knowing there was a 99.9% chance he wasn't), and he wasn't. And the host came right out and asked me \"Why, he is so full of himself, such a dick\"\n\nYikes, someone got yelled at, or saw something that the TV doesn't show.\nIf your staff is talking like that, then that's a problem.\n\nSo we sit, and I don't see anything I really want to eat.

But none of us wanted to wait for 45 mins to be able to eat. And definitely not when we were hungover.\n\nInstant seating meant we could order coffee and juices pronto.\nThe coffee was decent. And with multiple refills.\nThe Mango-Carrot juice cured my hangover. And my friend & I loved it so much, we ended up ordering 2 servings each!\n\nOur server was very sweet. Answered any question we had. And placed our orders pretty quick. The bread basket was very delicious. An eclectic blend of savory & sweet. The corn bread was yummaaaaaaay. And the chocolate brownie was melt-in-your-mouth yummy.\nBetween the 4 of us, we sampled a few dishes on their brunch menu:\n\nGoat cheese \"Fundido\" - While the dish does contain goat cheese, there's a strong flavor of other cheeses as well. Manchego being prominent. The corn chips that come with are fresh too. Beware, the dish is very rich, just as any other dish at Mesa.\n\nSpicy Chicken w/ sweet potato hash - This is an offshoot of your eggs benedict. It's literally eggs benedict on top of a very uniquely made sweet potato hash brown. Very well presented. And equally tasty.\n\nSpicy Scrambled eggs - This one had no chance. The husband inhaled it. \n\nScrambled eggs chilaquiles - This is a very rich dish with creme fraiche. I couldn't finish it and neither could my girl friend. It probably is the best in town. The potatoes that come with are so yummy. Get those, skip the grits.\n\nNow, if you have cholesterol issues or are trying to lose a few lbs, Mesa is not the place for you. While the food is tasty, it's also very buttery/cheesy/oily. You might end up with heartburn, and give them one star less in the process.\n\nService was nice and on top of their job. Price was reasonable given that it's Las Vegas & Bobby Flay's place.\n\nI'll go back... maybe after I drop a few lbs..."

I was with two of my friends from Australia and wanted to show them a bit of southwest cuisine. Coming from Arizona, I have very high expectations on southwest food. \n\nWe decided to go for lunch, since reading the review that dinner is busier. The atmosphere was pretty laid back, all the customers where in shorts and flip flops. So It was strange to me that the hostess told one of my friends to remove their hat because they had a strict dress code (uh everyone is in shorts and flip flops???)  I knew exactly what I wanted (from reading yelp reviews) but decided to test the waiter. I asked him what he would recommend. He then proceeded to tell me \"everything\" ...OK seriously, what would you recommend? He then pointed to some fish thing and said \"this looks good\" Test failed!!! \n\nMy two Australian friends ordered the shrimp and chicken tacos. I decided to order the pork sandwich. The waiter told me that this is a cold sandwich with warm bread. Me: \"Uh can you throw it in the oven or something\" him: \"No\"- I decided to give it a shot, why not Bobby Flay should know what he is doing. The waiter was extremely prompt about refilling our waters, maybe a little to eager, every time I took a drink he refilled. \n\nThe bread basket came out and me being a carbholic I was so excited for the bread. I tried the Jalapeno one first and thought it was OK. Tasted like something I could get at my local grocery store bakery. I then tried the \"famous\" blue corn. It was super fragile I lifted it and it fell apart in my hand. The piece I did get was mushy and looked undercooked. I did not finish the rest. My Australian friends took a bite and said it tasted funny. \n\nThe food was so disappointing!! \n\nThe shrimp tacos came out with literally 3 pieces of shrimp and two small tortillas. Uh where the heck is the rest of the food! Same with the chicken tacos. My two Friends ate them in a matter of minutes. My pork sandwich was considerably bigger. But was so weird being that it was cold pulled pork with pieces of fat. Pork fat cold is not tasty at all. I will give them this- the Mexican fries it came with were tasty- but anyone can throw cilantro on some fries and get the same thing. \n\nI was so disappointed and not to mention my friends were hungry 5 min after we left the restaurant. For being such a big name Bobby Flay needs to reconnect with the local level cuisine. Come to Arizona and experience what real southwest cuisine taste like. \n\nIf you want mediocre southwest cuisine go to Mesa Grill - other wise save your money and try a different restaurant. \n\nPS I am no longer a fan of Bobby Flay!!!!!"

However, that item blew me away enough to run to Yelp and share my experience. I had the smoked chicken quesadilla, which was actually out of this world. \n\nThe size itself was pretty small, but unlike your average small quesadilla, was still packed with gooey cheese and chicken where you can actually taste the smokiness in each bite. The guacamole, creme fraisse and roasted garlic shavings ensured that every bite was absolutely loaded with flavor. I even believe the tortilla itself was sprinkled with some smoky, chipotle magic. I was in heaven every moment until my last bite.\n\nI do have one quip though: I ordered a glass of cab with my quesadilla, and when the bill came I noticed it was only ONE DOLLAR less than my meal- pardon? The waitress (bartender in my case) explained that it was their only glass of cab, that's why it was 16 dollars. Would have liked to have been warned I would be paying virtually the same thing for my meal, but whatever. For the best quesadilla of my life, I'll cut my losses."

I have to admit, even though im not a big fan of Bobby Flay himself, his use of big flavors and for some reason vibrant colors with his southwestern flare does indeed comfirm his bold and cocky style.  Mesa Grill did not dissapoint, but anyways, ill jus cut to the chase, this is what i tasted\n\ngoat cheese queso fundido- probably not so good if you dont like the taste of heavy nutty cheeses, very strong goat cheese flavor\nraw tuna nachos- famous dish, the mango and avocado sauce is a good combo\npork loin sandwhich- the ancho chile mayo is spicy, actually not so bad, pretty tasty, the arugula and chiabatta bread complements it well, its served cold but for some reason, i think it would taste better hot\nmesa burger- a decent burger, served with seasoned fries\nspicy chicken sweet potatoe hash- probably the best taste, sweet potatoes with eggs and hollandaise, did not taste as heavy as i thought, notbad\nhoney glazed salmon and the new york strip- not great, not bad, nothing very special, or i guess wats special was the bbq sauces they use for the meats, didnt really ruin the flavors of the meats\nanother thing was i heard mesa is famous for their breads, i was lookin for to the famous corn bread, but it was dry and it was cold, it seemed like it always broke apart and didnt hold together well, but the little jalopeno biscuits were good\n\n3.5 stars"

For starters we had the blue corn pancake with barbecue duck and the tiger shrimp with a garlic corn tamale. The tiger shrimp and the tamale was very delicious, so many different flavors in on little tamale. I found the pancake and duck however to be quite sweet, not one of my favorites.

O my god it was good.  the dish is extremely extremely hearty and filling.  i could only eat half.  it was fun to have all the wonderful textures and flavors on my tongue.  the heat could have been turned up, but i am a big big fan of heat.\n\nDinner: I had a coffee rubbed filet done medium rare.  It was a big deal for me to order a filet, as i don't think i've ordered a filet since i was 13.  But the idea of something rubbed in coffee sounded really good and interesting.  The flavor of the dish, unsurprisingly was very bitter.  But i wouldn't say it was bitter in a bad way, just very different.  The steak itself was cooked really well, so i have no complaints about the meat.  It was an interesting entree.  it might not be the most delicious thing to order, but it's definitely worth trying.\n\nThere was also this amazing pea/chile soup which they no longer have on the menu.  it was one of the most delicious soups i've ever ever ever had. The soup's color was also a vibrant green and for some reason green is always appetizing in my head.  \n\nApps: i thought most of the apps were only ok."

Portions were tiny. \n\nWhite peach margarita was AWESOME!!!! Prickly pear was passable....no prickly pear flavor...I'm Mexican, so I know...skip it. \n\nLamb porterhouse chops....WONDERFUL. \n\nPork tenderloin....very good. Lamb is better. \n\nBrussel sprouts were good. Waiter told us it was enough for 2 (because I asked!) It better be for $8. Umm, there were about 6 brussel sprouts cut in half with a few pomegranate seeds...sorry that isn't worth $8.  And just sprinkling pomegranate seeds on it doesn't make it \"cool\" or whatever the intent was.  \n\nWhat I don't get are the sweet tamales that are paired with the entrees. I had the pumpkin tamal...lukewarm, dry. My partner had some other kind of sweet tamal and it was moister and tastier than mine....regardless, I think the tamales need to be savory to pair well with the entrees...how about nice veggie tamales with cheese and a bit of spice...isn't spice what you are known for Bobby? \n\nI wanted to re-wrap the tamal and take it home to eat with a tall glass of milk - would have been worth the effort if it tasted better. Doesn't work with the dish. \n\nI still give it 4 stars because of the white peach margarita and the yummy entrees. We know what to avoid next time and explore other parts of the extensive menu."

We have been hitting the usual places that we always go to when we visit Las Vegas (Sushi Samba, Julian Serrano Tapas) and a few new places (Sage, Central by Michel Richard) to name a few. We asked for a table for 2 as we walked in.  The hostess plainly informed us that I need to take off my hat to be able to seat in the dining area.  I was taken aback since we have been dining in much more upscale places and never was asked to take my hat off.  MInd you this was late afternoon not dinner time.  I asked what was the dress code and the hostess informed me that it was casual.  As I looked around to the 4 or 5 occupied tables, the majority of the clientele was wearing t-shirts, shorts and slippers.  I was informed that those were casual wear but not a hat and the restaurant is trying to keep their high standards.  I was stunned by the pretentiousness that was permeating infront of me.  So I took my hat off and proceeded to our table hoping that the food would put me in a better mood.  The server was trying so hard to suggest several dishes and we accepted some of his suggestions.  The appetizer was good but too bad we can not enjoy this since the main dishes arrive as we took our first bite.  The servers then slammed the rest of the food in our small table and left.  The rest of the dishes were mediocre, bland (salt & pepper anyone?) and pedestrian.  Over all I felt like I went to a chain restaurant like Chevy's or CPK and was insulted and served avarage food.

Also, been wanting to trying it as I wanted to take my mom who I suspect is in love with Bobby Flay.\n\n#1, even with reservations, you cannot be seated unless your whole party is there.  We were never instructed/given the suggestion of having drinks at the bar.  Though bar was quite crowded anyway.  The result was a very number of us, maybe 20 or so, standing in the reception area.  A bit of a crowd and much jostling about as people were coming and going and waiters/waitresses were trying to pass by.\n\nWait staff seated us and gave menus promptly.  No specials mentioned and they seemed frazzled, Sunday night over Memorial Day.  Had the cactus pear margarita.  Very good.  Had asked if bartender could make a jalapeno mojito but apparently he didn't know how (don't have a fancy smartphone to google recipe?).  Bartender was kind enough to get us the recipe for the drink though.  Wait staff continued to underimpress us as a fine dining experience but were adequate if we pretended we were at Outbacks.\n\nSo the night before we watched a rerun of best things I ever ate Vegas.  Mentioned was the shrimp tamale.  Wow, it certainly was pretty mediocre.  Sauce and shrimp was cooked well but that was one dry tamale.  We ate the shrimp and left the rest of tamale.  Also had the duck tacos.  The duck was a bit overcooked but the sauce was good.\n\nOnto food, pork tenderloin was tasty, chicken was dry and husband's rib eye steak was mediocre.  I ordered the tuna steak.  I ordered it rare and it came out medium well, there was a light pink center with canned tuna tasting outer layer.  Promptly sent back.  They redid and it was OK but it was obvious the grill master did not have the grill high enough for sufficient crisping of the outer layer. We ordered some corn tamales and corn pudding.  The tamale went mostly uneaten after the first bite and the corn pudding was salty.  We were so disappointed we decided to head elsewhere for dessert.  Total bill was $450+tip for 4 people and drinks.  \n\nHaving eaten at Rick Bayless's restaurant Topo in Chicago, the difference between having the chef on site vs only their name plastered on the door is remarkable.  On a Wed, Bayless was there with a stained apron, sweating away in the kitchen.  It's been 2 years and I still remember that remarkable restaurant.  I will remember this restaurant only in terms of it's disappointments.  All hype and no substance.  May try his flagship in NYC, hopefully will be better but not much inspired to do so after this flop."

Three of us started off with the salmon nachos as an appetizer and we quickly realized a mistake had been made.  The \"nachos\" consisted of maybe 4 ounces of salmon tartar with a two ounce serving of tortilla chips.  This would have not been a problem if the dish had not called salmon nachos.  Had it been called \"salmon tartare with tortilla chips\" we could have passed and saved the $20.  Go anywhere and order nachos, and you will be greeted by a giant pile of chips topped with goodies, just not at Mesa.  \nThen came the burger.  I'm not hard to please, trust me, but this burger was a 3 out of 10 at best, and the \"southwest fries\" were 2 out of 10.  The burger was heavily spiced pre cooking, thus leaving a crusted outer coating that was unappealing.  From what I could tell, there really wasn't a sauce on the bun and the whole burger just felt like it was missing something.  The fries were pretty basic and over coated in seasoned salt.  Worse yet, the dish came with a side of dijon mustard that neither complimented the burger or the fries.  \nThere were some pluses to the meal.  We received a nice basket of mixed breads to start the meal.  The one issue with the bread was that some were sweet breakfast breads and some were savory jalape\u00f1o breads and some were a mystery.  Not knowing whether a bread is going to be sweet or spicy can be a little frustrating to the palate.  Our server was also nice.  \nIn the end, I finally made it to a restaurant that had been on my to-do list for many years and my party and I left extremely unsatisfied.  $117 for a burger, 2 ounces of nachos, a couple tacos and a piece of fish, next time we will pass."

Every dish was brimming over with flavor yet not at all overwhelming. instead, you end up craving for more of that spicy, savory, and comforting taste. \n\n-Bread Basket: Jalapeno corn bread, muffins...we ate it all!\n-Tiger Shrimp & Garlic Blue Corn tamale: amazing! The tamales are so delicious!\n-Mango spiced crusted Tuna Steak w/ toasted pinenut Cous Cous: I was pining nuts over this meal. The toasted couscous was crispy so that it naturally coated the tuna steak in a breadcrumb like consistency. Mangoes balanced the salty flavors of the spices. Good proportions for tuna steak.\n\nI just might admit to being a fan of Flay...almost."

I had the 16 spice chicken (I think that is the name) and a side order of cauiflower gratin.  The chicken was moist and the gratin was super cheesy goodness but not overdone and you could still taste the cauliflower.  Yummy!  Wish I could duplicate this place in the Bay Area.  Will definitely be checking out the outpost in NY when I go next time.  The cactus margarita was tasty as well.  But I do have to say that my meal with booze was not cheap at all but well worth it!"

Two of us had the huge Mesa Burger, one had the shrimp tacos and  I had the Chicken & Sweet potato hash.  \n\nAs a matter of fact, it was so good that Sunday my husband and I went back for brunch.  We were up a bit early (10:30am) and there weren't many places open for brunch (which we thought was odd) but in checking around we found Mesa Grill was open and had a brunch menu (rather than just the usual lunch fare that many restaurants serve).\n\nWe had the bacon & hash brown quesedilla topped with a fried egg (the bacon was smokey and wonderful) and the Egg Sirloin Tortilla which is essentially fajitas with eggs & steak (and nice spicy garnishes).  The bread bowl mix was toward sweet breads (as one would expect) and they were all delicious.  And one of the best spicy Bloody Marys I've ever had.  \n\nI usually think most celebrity chef restaurants are forgettable and we'd planned just to stop for a drink and maybe an appetizer..., but this one was good enough to visit twice in one weekend.  I'll definitely be back!"

I am a fan of Bobby Flay and his food on Food Network looks amazing, but I would never recommend this restaurant to someone visiting Vegas.\n\nThe hostess was rude when I informed her that our original group of 8 was now 10, which should have been a sign to go somewhere else to eat, but we soldiered on.  They split us up into a table for 4 and a table for 6.  The server had a thick accent and was difficult to understand.  The service was poor and the food took too long to come out.  \n\nHighlights:  bread basket- all of it was really good, especially the jalapeno bread, quesadilla was perfection ... the bacon, cheese, onions and bacon were amazing.  Everyone at the table enjoyed it.  The ribeye steak, which was off menu, was excellent.  The home fries were also good.\n\nLow lights:  All of the egg dishes were really bland. The tiger shrimp tamale was bland and the sauce was too thin.  The mimosa was weak.  Everyone hated the hominy grits ... our table was full of Southerners, so grits have a high bar to meet and it failed miserably.\n\nVery disappointing and truly the culinary low light of our Vegas trip."

The tiger shrimp and sweet potato tamale lived up to its reputation, and the salmon was cooked perfectly and had a delicious mole with a ton of flavor underneath.  The other fish we had was also cooked perfectly although the preparation was less unique (it came on top of crab with edamame, corn and a buttery sauce).  The cornbread and jalepeno bread at the beginning is a nice perk and yummy.\n\nMargaritas: 2 stars.  Bummer!  This is the only part that knocks it down to an overall 4 star experience.  Both margaritas we had (one was a cactus pear, the other was another \"speciality\") were overly sweet, tasted the same, small, and couldn't really taste the tequila.  I was expecting a long list of tasty and inventive margaritas, and instead found a good tequila selection, but nothing more.  If I get the chance to go back, I'll leave the drinking for the casino!"

In a sea of generic Pasta and meat, here were two unique takes an seemingly common dishes. The Chile Relleno was stuffed with chewy eggplant and a delicious red pepper sauce. The only criticism is that the portion is rather meager and for a main course Vegetarian dish, they should consider doubling it up. The chicken with potato hash was superbly put together with a perfectly cooked egg. It all came together with some delicious sauce on the side. A+ in coming up with something different with sensible flavors. Again maybe the portions are probably a bit on the lighter side for heavy eaters.\n\nWe ended with a carrot cake Cream cheese ice cream sandwich that was okay, while not A+ it's certainly a good dessert to share. I would work on the proportions of the dish a bit and maybe consider something to go along with it that offers some tangy/zesty type flavor.\n\nOverall though our experience was stellar, we even saw Bobby himself walk in towards the end of our meal. If you don't like the experience when the Master himself is in the house, then it's just not worth it, but in this case its quite the opposite. \n\nMaybe it was his presence but hopefully they are always this good. The overall experience was one of the best we have had in Vegas and a fine example of creative thinking in a sea of generic \"upscale\" dishes. Kudos Bobby we will be visiting again next time."

As our main course we opted for the 16 spice chicken and chile relleno. The chicken was fantastic (although the pesto potatoes are the real star) but the relleno was eh. I can get better at my local taco stand. We had the churros for dessert and the delicate anise flavor was just right. It should be noted that I typically will avoid this flavor but in the churros, it worked. If you are looking for the best dang margarita you have ever had, then order the signature marg at Mesa....one will get ya going.\nWe have agreed that it might be best to just order appetizers next time but either way we are coming back!"

The waiter explained that the house tequilas were all 100% blue agave, so I ordered a house margarita. I will say hands down that it was the best margarita I've ever had (and I have had a lot of them!!) We were served jalapeno cornbread that my husband really loved but I found too crumbly. \n\nWe ordered the crispy squid appetizer and it definitely lived up to the description. The dish was simply calamari, but they aren't joking that it is crispy. I was just slightly disappointed that the menu wasn't the same as the menu posted outside the restaurant. I was really looking forward to that roasted corn soup they advertised!\n\nFor our main entrees we both had trouble deciding so we asked our server for guidance and he was very helpful. I had the green chile cioppino and the husband had the pork loin. The green chile cioppino was heavenly and I was so sad I didn't get more broth! I wanted to lick the bowl clean. I wish the cioppino was served with rice instead of a chunk of unsavory cornbread in the bowl, but other than that I was very happy with this dish. I was not a fan of the pork loin because it was crusted with something that tasted very strong and spicy and I didn't get any pork flavor. However, my husband looked like he was in a state of bliss so I let him eat as much as he wanted. We were very tipsy at this point so we decided to skip dessert and hit the tables. \n\nI would highly recommend this place to anyone but its probably best if you like bold and spicy flavors. We had others who were on dates around us but also many large groups of friends and right next to us there was a big group of drunk, rowdy businessmen. This place is loud and open so its not a good place for people who desire a quiet, intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe servers here really know how to deliver service. When I stood up to use the restroom I asked a server where it was. He walked me halfway to the front so I could see it before he pointed it out to me. In addition, if you walk by any servers they immediately give you a wide berth as though you are some sort of royalty. I also like it when I leave the table and return to find that the server has folded my napkin. To me, that's the mark of truly excellent table service."

My main issue is that I'm a big fan of lamb but the citrus sauce that they used pretty much killed all the gamey flavor.  I guess that's fine for people who don't want a gamey taste but then they probably shouldn't be ordering lamb anyways.  For the price, I would definitely recommend going elsewhere."

Is it that their dinner menu is a tad bit better than their lunch?\n\nThe best and most interesting appetizer they have is the blue corn pancake with duck.  It was absolutely delicious, but nothing you can't get at a decent dim sum place.  Sure, it has that southwestern twist but it gets lost in the richness of flavor from the duck.  You can skip the quesadilla here -- it was a really boring food experience.\n\nMy favorite entree here is the chicken and mango dish.  It was flavorful and fun to eat.  The steak sandwich I had here for lunch was downright awful, though!  I took three bites, and that's as far as I could go.  What a waste.  The mesa burger here is good, but the chile relleno is average.  \n\nHonestly, the food they dish out here isn't worth the high prices on the menu.

And don't flake on your reservation, either.  These guys mean it when you make a reservation because if you no-show, they charge you $50 per head!  Opps did you oversleep?  That's a pretty expensive nap you just took.\n\nIt's right by the sportsbook at Caesar's Palace.  We arrived right on time and were promptly seated.  The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were:\n-scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner.\n-lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious.\n-pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.\n\nThis is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.  But sometimes it's about the experience and crossing items off your bucket list, and if you can't do that in Vegas, then you might want to check if you still have a pulse.  =)"

I ordered their Venisen off the regular menu, medium rare and it was super, super delicious!  Now i never tried venisen before and was told the meat was simliar to lamb and it was quite a good description.  My dish came out on 2 chops, kinda stingy but it was filling to say the least.  The order comes with a mini corn cake on the side, VERY VERY small, a dark brown sauce that is pretty good...a little bit sweat and tangy , but basically the dish is served a la carte.  I would recommend ordering a side of something... my friends got mashed potatoes, some got fries, and another ordered a blue-corn pancake thing that was $14 and not very good..haha.  I had an opportunity to try their NY-Steak $40 on their menu and it was probably the best tasting meats I've ever had.  It was really full of flavor and not blood or running in any way.  I'm sure they let it sit out after cooking to hold in the juices or it was frozen before grilling.  The meat was pretty rare even though it was supposed to be cooked medium.  \n\nOverall this place is good, very good, but very expensive.  Be prepared to shell around at least $50 per person.  Like the other reviews, this place is GREAT to bring your girl friend, wife, husband, parents, in-laws....very impressive."

Additionally, when I planned my Las Vegas trip, I knew I wanted to eat at a celebrity chef's restaurant (or two...).  Seeing as how Bobby Flay is one of my all-time favorites, it was pretty evident that Mesa would be the restaurant I wanted to choose.  Not to mention, I've heard and read great things about it.  \n\nI had called earlier in the afternoon to make reservations for that evening and was excited to hear that they had a few reservations available for a Saturday night (12/1).  However, I was attending a show at 10pm and the two reservations available were 5:30 and 8:30.  The hostess who answered the call was kind enough to tell me that the 8:30 time slot was going to be cutting it close for us and informed me that we could dine at the bar, with a full menu.  I thanked her and figured those were my plans.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is awesome.  The table layout gives each party their own little area to feel cozy, but not alone in the restaurant.  The vibe is energetic and hip.  \n\nUpon arrival, we told the hostess that we were planning to dine at the bar because the wait for a table was 45-50 minutes.  She pointed out that a few specific guests sitting at the bar would be leaving to go to their table shortly.  I appreciated the tip.  Within maybe 15 minutes, the seats became available and we hopped up to the bar.  \n\nThe bartender greeted us and I didn't order a specialty drink, but my Ketel martini was made perfectly. \n\nI had already eaten a lot earlier that day, so I ended up only ordering an entree: Black Florida Grouper.  My expectations were extremely high for this restaurant and unfortunately, the entree fell short.  My grouper was way overcooked.  It was tough and it didn't flake at all.  It was dry, but some of the sauce made up for that.  The flavor was definitely there -- the execution was not.  My friend ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno, which she said was delicious.  \n\nAdditionally, being that I work in the service industry, I do not complain a lot and chose not to with this dish.  But I was very disappointed when our bartender didn't even ask how our dishes were.  In fact, we were pretty much ignored for most of the meal after our entrees were dropped.  I had to ask for the check myself after my empty entree plate sat in front of me for 10-15 minutes.  \n\nAll in all, the food was mediocre and the service was as well. The only positive notes were the helpful hostesses.  Very disappointing for me to say the least, especially since this was the one part of the trip I was looking forward to."

But I digress.\n\nSecond time I was here, I ordered the tuna for the sake of trying something new.

Six thimble sized biscuits, a cheddar jalapeno corn muffin, two pieces of blueberry coffee cake and two miniature chocolate scones.  It looks pretty, and is a fun gesture, but the only bread of note was the blueberry coffee cake.  The scones and biscuits were both very dry.\n\nWe split the shrimp tamale appetizer, smoked chicken sweet potato hash and the cheese grits.  The tamale was just as good as it looks in photos, and if I came again I would definitely order one (or two) of those.  The sauce was very salty, so if you are sensitive to that you might want to pick a different item.  The hash had a really strong vinegar flavor.  I like vinegar, but the whole thing just tasted like someone had dumped a bunch of cheap hot sauce all over it.  Plus, it came out really fast, and was lukewarm.  With all the great reviews of this dish, I was very unimpressed - especially with the $18 price tag. The cheese grits were not at all what I was expecting.  Good Southern style grits are fluffy, these are very heavy.  They tasted like cream cheese and green chili, so it is hard to say they were bad, they just weren't at all as expected.\n\nThe service was attentive - too attentive!  One of the servers was literally standing over my husbands shoulder waiting for him to take his last bite.  This just felt awkward.  \n\nPerhaps dinner would be a better time to go, but I just feel like this place is more about aesthetics and less about freshness and flavor."

The atmosphere is relaxed and hip. My server was incredibly nice, helpful and thoughtful. I started with the tuna and salmon tartar. It was ok - tasted fresh and The spicy cilantro sauce was good but I've certainly had better ahi. Then, on my servers recommendation, I ordered the Filet with mushroom black pepper and red wine reduction. I planned on ordering something more \"Bobby\" with chipotle and the like, but I'm glad I didn't. The filet was fantastic. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor, overall extremely good. I also ordered the grilled corn, and must say it was one of the best side dishes ive ever had. Really. Sweet, spicy, crunchy and velvety all in each bite. Wow. I finished things off with cinnamon sugar churros and star anise chocolate dipping sauce. The churros were crisp on the outside and soft on the I side. The star anise in the sauce is interesting, certainly adds interesting depth to the chocolate. So... This was not a cheap meal, but it was one if the better meals I've eaten and I would certainly go back. I would have given it a perfect five if not for the ahi."

But only my daughter and I actually got our main course.\n\nFor our 24th wedding anniversery we decided to go to Bobby Flays Mesa grill. Now I wish we had gone to denny's. \nMy wife eats her meat just shy of well done and hers came out cut open (they say for presentation) and still raw enough that I wouldn't have eaten it and I like mine rare to mid-rare. So my first problem was when they cut it open they had to see it was still way underdone but sent it anyway. And after it went back to be cooked a little more it never came back. Almost 10 minutes after the kid and I were done the waiter came back and said it would be another 5-10 minutes. We had a show to get to so we told him just get us our check. \nI'm still very unhappy about it since it was our anniversery dinner and I had to grab a bite for my Wife somewhere else.\n\nLike I said we've been there before and it was great. Maybe it was a new cook or the cook didn't care I don't know but the overall attitude was \"Sorry, have a nice night BYE !\". So I leave it with this. The service was better at any of the buffetts and we all got to eat. When we wet to Emeril's Delmonico it blew Bobby's away. \nSorry bobby, Love the food, Love the show's but Mesa vgas FAILED that night.\nOh, and the table next to us was having a simular issue.\n\n\nEdited to add : I just went through reading alot of the reviews and found that most of the complaints from the time I was down there are all very simular in the undercooked food department."

His suggestions were great because I had no complaints about the food and the food was amazing.\n\nFor an appetizer we had the Garlic Shrimp Tamale. It was delicious, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce went so well with the shrimp. Also the tamale really went with the shrimp.\n\nWe had 4 things, the Pork Tenderloin, Veal chop, Lamb chop and the roasted Brussels sprout salad . The Pork tenderloin was very soft and the sauce went well with it. I also liked how all the meat dishes came with a tamale, each with a different taste to go with it. It's been a quite a while since I ate at Mesa grill so I forgot what went with the Pork Tenderloin, I think it was a sweet Tamale. The Veal chop was so moist and soft. The ratio of fat to meat was perfect. The reason I really liked the Veal chop was that it was really juicy, but the juices don't flow out of the meat, but instead stay in the chop. I think the tamale I got with the Veal chop was a cheesy one. The Lamb chop was also really good, which is saying something as I don't normally like the taste of lamb. The brussel sprout salad was also delicious. The brussel sprouts were perfectly charred, and the pomegranates added a nice sweet touch.\n\nI highly recommend eating here"

Bobby, how do you manage to play with Southwestern flavors so naturally and creatively, elevate it to gourmet level, and yet maintain its authentic homey quality? He is the most down-to-earth of all the talented celebrity chefs, and you can feel it in his food. \n\nThe restaurant is another story... It's wonderfully trendy and fun, very colorful. The ambience feels more like a fancy bar, but I love it. We came here to start a night that ended at PURE; a really good way to start your night, it has a great energy.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and thinking of trying this place, stop thinking and just eat here!\n\nWe came without reservations on a busy Friday night. The wait was very long, but they were accommodating and offered to serve us in the bar area. The bar tables are pretty small, and could barely fit our party of four. But the food made up for everything. This is a small restaurant ladies and gentlemen, and it gets PACKED! So please, do yourselves a favor and make a RESERVATION. \n\nI had the ancho-chile marinated salmon, and the cilantro mashed potatoes. The red-sauce basted salmon came plated atop a green tomatillo sauce and a black bean sauce. Did I mention i love sauces?! Everything was very flavorful, which makes me happy, but all well-balanced. The cilantro mashed potatoes were my FAV, I'm a big fan of cilantro. \n\nThe best part....wait for it...all the recipes are available on the food network website, so you can make Bobby's dishes at home! I'm not sure if they will come out as good, though. I will be making this salmon (with the sauces) at home.\n\nPrice: $42 plus tax and tip for the salmon and mashed potatoes. A bit pricey, but well worth it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Brilliant use of southwestern flavors, amazing food. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Splurge a little, give it a try, I guarantee you won't regret it. Don't forget to make a reservation."

It was Friday night but we got seated pretty quickly even though we were about 5 minutes late due to a bit of a miscalculation on our flight arrival time. Place was busy but they were definitely moving people in & out pretty quickly.   We choose this place because we wanted to experience a Bobby Flay restaurant after seeing so much of him on The Food Network. We weren't disappointed!\n\nTheir bread basket had a nice cheese bread, corn muffin & a walnut raisin bread. All were good, but our favorite was the cheese bread with peppers. We then started out with these mini (& I do mean mini!!!) blue corn lobster tacos for an appetizer. After laughing about the size (maybe 2\"x1\" tacos) we split the 3 tacos. We weren't laughing then!  We were licking our fingers!  Very delicious.  One of our servers was joking with us about how they had tastings of them when the tacos were introduced & they all had the same complaint... They wanted more!  We agreed, yummy!\n\nThen we ordered the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon & grilled chicken to share. We honestly thought we'd like the salmon better, but both really liked the spicy tangy sauce on the chicken. Plus it had this yummy corn tamale on the side. Salmon was good & was cooked very well, but I guess we just thought it was not especially different tasting than what we could get somewhere else. Strangely enough, it was our side dish of Roasted Corn that we liked the most!  What a burst of flavor from the aioli & cheese on it!  At first I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish it because I wanted to save room for dessert, but I couldn't resist because it was great. \n\nBut the absolute best part of the meal (it had us talking about it all weekend long!) was the Sticky Toffee Pudding!  OMG!!! It's sweet, yet salty, sticky but not too much & the texture of the cake/pudding was firm but moist. Sooooo good!  I didn't have any of the vanilla ice cream it was served with cuz I'm lactose intolerant, but my hubby said it was not really anything special. But he ate it anyway!  \n\nOverall, the food was great, the servers really were on top of everything & very friendly. Not at all snooty or aloof.

It was REALLY good. I loved the creme fraiche and the mint on top.\n\nI had the blue corn crusted halibut for my main course. It was cooked perfectly. The flavors were unique and I really liked it.\n\nOthers at my table ordered the beef tartare and salmon + spicy tuna tartare. I'm glad I didn't order those because they had no flavor.\n\nNext time, I will come here for dinner. Bobby Flay has redeemed himself."

You can read my Stack review to see what went very wrong there. But we've been to Mesa Grill four times now, and it will always be our must-go-to restaurant in Vegas.  \n\nOur dinner was late, after 9:30 p.m., Saturday, Caesar's, Vegas.  Energy level in the restaurant was marvelous, great wait and host staff, terrific sommelier, wonderful wine choice (well, that was OUR choice, but still, to have Fiddlehead Fiddlestix on the menu is amazing in and of itself).  \n\nThe bread is the best (esp. that little corn muffin with the chilis....we fight over it!).  Great vodka choices for before dinner.  Hubby had the pork tenderloin--it is their killer dish.  I always get something different, so I had the chile relleno and it was wonderful--crispy crunchy crust (not doughy), a poblano chile of top quality, filled with goat cheese, eggplant, yuuuuumy.  Not huge, but just enough and just great.  \n\nThe BEST."

The fried green tomatos are really tasty. Breaded in cornmeal then fresh crab meat is dressed on top. The sauce is a bit spicey with a kick after eating it. Bone in ribeye is excellent. Bobby Flay saved himself with his grilling skills. The steak was seasoned with a southwest spice flavor to it. It literally leaves spicey-ness into your mouth. Maybe that's why our waiter (Richard) waited (I actually had to reminde him twice) for my house margarita...which I had to pay for.\n\nWould have been given 5 stars had our waiter visited us besides taking our order and giving us our check.  He almost single handedly ruined my fried green tomato experience."

His menu modernizes traditional southwestern dishes, pairing spicy and sweet wonderfully. \n\nLocated in Caesar's Palace, the decor is modern and bright with reds & yellows and an upscale but comfortable, intimate atmosphere. Be prepared for a wait without a reservation.\n\nBread Basket: Several varieties of warm fresh breads. The blue corn jalapeno muffins were a hit with this guy. Asked the waiter to bring more ASAP. Munched heavily on the asiago jalapeno bread as well.\n\nTiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: ($18) As the appetizer of the century I was more than happy to have ordered this. Shrimp was cooked lovely and dusted with spicy, sweet flavors. A warm, soft tamale wrapped up lime cilantro & a chipotle aioli. Nicely done sir, nicely done.\n\nGrilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: ($42) Decadent, fall off the bone lamb. The serrano chili sauce adds some warmth to the bite, without making you sweat. Not to overpower, a mint chimichurri adds a unique minty jalapeno aroma & character. \n\nI shall return."

Once seated we ordered The Yucatan Chicken Tacos, Goat Cheese Queso and the Smoked Chicken and black bean quesadilla. Yum!! Everything was incredibly flavorful and delicious.

I will say, the duck appetizer was fantastic and I highly recommend it and the side dishes were also good, although $10 for a pretty small dish.  My big disappointment was my main dish.  I ordered the veal chop, which was huge.  I was so ready for this, but once I cut into it, it was pure fat.  And at $48 I was sick about it.  After cutting away about half of it, I finally gave up.  Didn't get much to eat.  And our waiter never came back to ask how our meals were, or I would have sent it back.  By the time he re-appeared, they had already cleared our plates, so I didn't say anything.  Needless to say, when my $94 bill arrived, I was not happy.  Don't think I will be returning any time soon."

The appetizer and main course are on the regular menu.  Dessert is not listed on their website menu so this was a good sampler of the real thing at Mesa Grill.\n\nOn being seated, I was given the regular menu, a wine and cocktail menu, and the Restaurant Week menu.  My server, Rodil, was great with ordering and everything thereafter.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought quickly followed by bread basket with a nice selection--two slices of jalape\u00f1o bread with a nice kick, a corn muffin, and two slices of raisin bread.  Accompanying the bread was softened butter.  I also tried the corn muffin.  It was good but a little dry.  The best thing about the muffin was the number of corn bits baked into it.  Still the jalape\u00f1o bread was my favorite.\n\nFor the first course, I ordered the blue corn pancake.  It was filled with duck and had a habanero chile-star anise sauce.  Rodil had alerted me that this wasn't spicy, but for a starter, I didn't care.\n\nThe second course was Flay's signature dish, New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamal which had a round of crushed pecan butter placed into the sweet potato/corn mixture to add liquid.  The pork was tender and cooked perfectly.  The spices rubbed on the pork gave it some great flavor and zing, and the ancho chile sauce was excellent--dark, rich, and very flavorful.  Rodil noticed that I was almost snorting the sauce and he asked if I wanted more, the pusher.  He brought a small round dish with extra ancho sauce.  I dipped my tenderloin in the sauce with abandon and joy!  The tamal was superb.  What an interesting twist on the common tamal.\n\nMy choice for dessert was Chocolate Bread Pudding with toasted bourbon marshmallow squares and graham cracker crisps on top.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and this was a fine ending to the meal.  It wasn't as sweet as most desserts and it complimented the flavors from the pork.\n\nI had the best seat in the house in my mind.  I was near the back of the restaurant seated along a railing where I could watch the chefs do their work.  I had a good view of the grill where the steaks were cooked, and I could see into the salad/dessert preparation area.  Right near me was the staging area where two people oversaw the distribution of food.  When an order came in, they each got a copy and they both checked to see things were correct.  The person working on the outside nearest me wiped the dishes to remove any stray food so presentation was perfect.\n\nI enjoyed the meal.  I was not hurried but things moved along at a good pace.  All the staff was efficient and pleasant.  This was a great meal to kick off the Spring 2012 Restaurant Week and I will be back!"

            "review": "Sadly this place only get's 2-stars and here's why.\n\nThe place is beautiful, clean and well staffed. We explained to the hostess that we were in a bit of a time crunch so we couldn't take a leisure lunch. We had a plane to catch and needed food first.\n\nWe were seated promptly after a brief sit in the lovely waiting area.  Our waiter greeted us and informed us he was aware we were in a bit of a time crunch.  He asked if we wanted waters and would bring the drink menu for us.\n\nWe got our waters and ordered drinks. I ordered one of their signature margaritas - the waiter explained the different between the (I think) 4 of them.  I choose the one he indicated was the sweetest some sort of cactus.  I found it to be less sweet than expected - but it was very good.  He then took our food order.\n\nThere were three of us and I'll list all our food and comment on those items I tried.\n\nSOPHIE'S CHOPPED SALAD - with Her Own Special Dressing + Crispy Tortillas --- 13.  My friend ordered it and she loved it - I also tasted it and it was very good, seemed fresh, and had a bunch of interesting things in it. I loved the dressing.\n\nYUCATAN CHICKEN SKEWERS - Peanut - Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce, Flour Tortillas, Pickled Red Onion + Mint --- 16.  Beware - the peanut smoked chile barbecue sauce is very spicy - while I enjoyed it - my friend felt it was just a bit too hot and didn't really come with a \"warning\". She's not a fan of spicy food and avoided dipping her chicken into this. This dish was served with the tiniest flour tortillas.\n\nMESA BURGER - Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion + Horseradish Mustard served with Southwestern Fries --- 18.  You like cheese? Then you'll love this burger. It was ordered medium well and it came that way. Meat was very tasty - but I am NOT a fan of cheese.  The Southwestern Fries were a bit salty.\n\nHOT SMOKED SALMON CLUB - Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, Arugula, Chipotle Aioli + Southwestern Fries --- 18.  This is what I ordered. I love seafood and was excited to try a smoked salmon club.  It came cut in half (thank you!) and was piled high with a cold smoked salmon mixture like the way tuna salad is mixed. You could taste the smoke and it reminded me of Alder wood smoked salmon from the Pacific Northwest. The bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. Lots of avocado. Basically all the toppings were fresh and yummy and the sandwich oozed out from all angles. I loved the Chipotle Aoili sauce and actually used it to dip my fries into. I also felt the fries were a bit salty but dipping into the sauce sort of muted the over saltiness.  This sandwich is not a HOT sandwich.\n\nHere's the reason Mesa Grill only get's 2 stars - Within an hour after eating my Hot Smoked Salmon Club - I became sick ... I was in the cab on the way to the airport when it started to hit me and I was like OH GREAT! I'm about to have to wait in lines and my luck there would be NO bathroom for miles!!  I warned my friends and one offered some Imodium - which I promptly took without water (YUCK)!!  This same friend ate the other half of my sandwich on the way to the airport - so I warned her to be careful.  Sure enough while loading onto the plane - she told me she wasn't feeling well either ... So that being said - 2 stars. You made me and my friend sick with your bad salmon!  I subtract a star for each time I had to run to the restroom with Salmon revenge!!\n\nThe decor was beautiful and like I said waitstaff was terrific. Serving bad salmon is no BUENO!"

I feel really bad that I forgot our server's name because he was super friendly and definitely not stuffy or high-nosed like some servers at higher end places. \n\nPeach Magarita:  I don't normally like Margaritas because I prefer sweet or citrusy drinks but I really liked this one. It tasted more like a white sangria because there was barely any sourness so I enjoyed it.\n\nPan Roasted Shrimp: This is the one I ordered and it  came with creamy green chile rice and smoked chile butter. The flavor was amazing and shrimp was big. It was also the perfect size since it was on the rich side. I could definitely see myself craving this for a creamy seafood fix.\n\nGreen Chile Cheeseburger: My boyfriend ordered this one but as usual I tasted it too lol it was a perfect medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It came with a slightly spicy queso sauce, roasted poblanos and pickled red onions. Yummm! \n\nSouthwestern Fries: These came with the burger and were the best fries I've had in a while. Super flavorful and whatever you do, ask for a side of peppered mayo. Our server asked if we wanted some so we were like sure, why not. I was expecting well, pepper in mayo lol  but what we got was this tangy zesty sauce and it was soo good that my boyfriend even put it on his burger.\n\nNow let's talk their Chocolate Cajeta Cake with vanilla swirl ice cream and salted chocolate crunch. I am in love. Head over heels in love. My boyfriend is rolling his eyes while I'm saying this lol but really. I am warning you though, this is sweet tooth craving to the extreme. It was almost a little too sweet and rich for me after the first few bites but I am the type of person that will choose chocolate over any savory meal any day. Soo if you're chocolate monster like I am, go for it!\n\nWe will definitely be back to try dinner and most likely for lunch again as well! A+ for Mr.Bobby Flay."

We figured we'd take a few bites and get the rest to go.  But the cakes were so delicious, we devoured every crumb.  The delicate coconut cake was filled with a light creme anglaise.  The chocolate cajeta cake was rich and moist but not too sweet.  It had a chocolate toffee topping and a luscious caramel sauce.  \n\nService was prompt and friendly.

The brunch menu is mostly several variations on scrambled eggs. It did not have any of the tamales that Bobby Flay is know for. We had to wait a little bit for a table since we had a large group and they had to push some tables together for us. The place has a nice feel with an open kitchen, although the set up made it a little hard to see the kitchen. The guy at the grill seemed to like that we were paying attention to him and kept looking up and smiling at us. In fact, everyone at the restaurant was friendly. The service was really good. At one point, one of the bussers dropped a fork and all three employees in the area went over to pick it up.\n\nI went with their version of steak and eggs. Actually half our group had that and the other half had the Mesa Burger. One person had scrambled egg enchiladas. The steak and eggs and burgers were a decent sized portion and we felt pretty full after, however I think my friend that got the enchiladas was a little disappointed as it cost as much as the burger, but you only got two small enchiladas.  You do get a basket of delicious bread with your meal.\n\nI'd like to try Mesa Grill again, but next time for lunch or dinner. A few notes: the dress code is relaxed in the day. There were several people in tshirt and shorts, myself included. However, they won't let you wear a hat. The table next to us had a very young child with them who was a picky eater and they were happy to make something special for him."

The sauces are very nice on the palate.  The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin did not come out hot although overcooked; you would expect more from a dish with a bourbon ancho sauce.  Perhaps if Bobby were in the kitchen the dishes would have impressed.  The Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye was good although I wish it were a bit rarer.  The desserts are definitely a must try with the Warm Chocolate Cake with dulce de leche or the Warm Cornbread Pudding.  The mixed drinks were nice although a bit on the weak side.  \n\nThe style and decor was nicely done with a view of the casino floor in the distance.  I would recommend having your hotel make a reservation for you should you decide to grab lunch or dinner at this popular destination.  The service can be a bit slow and the staff pretentious, but overall a nice experience.  Hopefully you won at the tables or the slots as you're bill is bound to put a crimp in your gambling."

Too bad we didn't think to ask if we could bring it home. \n\nMy husband had the Mesa Grill burger cooked medium (barf!) and fries and I had some egg dish that had a green chili sauce that was layered on crispy blue tortillas.  It was heavenly.  \n\nOur server seemed like he was kind of having a bad day but he was handling it like a champ and having a sense of humor about it.  He was a sport and kept our drinks refilled and food out on the table as soon as it was ready (or so it seemed).\n\nI can't wait til next time we can go to Mesa Grill."

I've never tried tex-mex food, but from this experience I don't think I will ever try tex-mex again. The restaurant is not at all fancy, but the minute my brother stepped in he was asked to take off his fedora hat. Come on, its not a baseball cap!! \n\n***FOOD:\n- They start you off with a basket of bread and this is probably the best thing in the restaurant (sad to say). The jalapeno and the blue berry bread were quite interesting and delicious. \n- I ordered the shrimp tamale and it was mediocre. I've had better. \n- The Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich was not the best. The bread was quite hard so I couldn't enjoy the sandwich.\n- The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash was pretty over-bearing in flavor. \n- The chicken salad was blah. The chicken was dry and nothing was great about it.\n\nOverall, mesa grill you have disappointed me and you will definitely not see me again. You would think the restaurant being owned by an iron chief would be good, but I guess not."

I have been to Mesa Grill a handful of times; twice for brunch and three times for dinner. It's awesome everytime. You need to like favor and a lil spicy because everything is very well spiced.  Here are some recommedations:\nBrunch - \n*the BEST THING on the brunch menu is their SPICY CHICKEN AND SWEET POTATO HASH with poached eggs.  It's goooie!\n*MESA BURGER is tasty but nothing extraordinary\n*BLOODY MARYS are made just right with a little extra kick\n\nDinner - so many excellent choices\n*RED AND BLACK PEPPER ENCRUSTED FILET MIGNON cooked perfectly\n*NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN the spiciest thing on the menu, pretty spicy but I couldn't stop eating it. YUM!\n*GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOP best lamb chops ever and so perfect with cranberry/jalapeno sauce.\n\nDessert:\nThey don't disappoint.

The best thing thats ever happened to him though, is the Food Network - because I would have otherwise never have given him or his restaurant a second thought. \n\nThe 2 bites I could get of our spicy tuna tartare with the tasty avocado relish appetitzer was divine. But seriously, thats all i could get because the dish  was just way too small for 2 people. Sophie's salad was 'ok'. Basically your typical chopped salad...but i kind of expected something with more creative flair from a food network chef. \nThe grilled tuna steak made up for it though. It was juicy and flavorful, though at the same time, very natural tasting.  The decor of the restaurant itself was nice, but nothing lent itself to making you feel like staying longer to soak things in or chit chat.  I guess thats how it is in Vegas. Always time to move on to whats next!"

The complimentary bread basket is always very fresh. Based on our multiple dining experiences these are my suggestions:\n\nOrder a margarita...any margarita. They are all fantastic! \n\nFor starters I recommend the shrimp tamales, tuna nachos, or either of their salads. I do not recommend the tomato soup...it is very marinara like, and more of a bread dip than a soup. \n\nAs for the entrees I highly recommend the salmon. I always want to try something different, but I love the salmon so much I never can bring myself to stray. My husband can't part from the coffee rubbed filet. \n\nYou may not realize it, but most of the entrees are a la carte, so it's a good idea to order a side or two. The corn is a must try! I have tried (and failed) many time to replicate this dish. It is absolutely delicious. I have also had the twice baked potato and saut\u00e9ed spinach, but they were both very underwhelming. \n\nMesa is the perfect spot for an upscale yet casual dinner! Do be sure to make reservations ahead of time as they tend to fill up fast."

I tried the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash on my first visit and I was instantly hooked.\n\nIt goes without saying, then, that when I found out I'd be coming to Vegas for my birthday, I immediately booked a brunch reservation at Mesa Grill.\n\nWe arrived right on time and were seated at a small table between two loud tables. Really? I booked this reservation months in advance and this is where you choose to seat me?\n\nBut okay, fine. I'm willing to overlook a questionable choice like that if the experience is otherwise perfect. It was not perfect. Not even close.\n\nMy dining companion and I decided to start with a cocktail each, and my dining companion also took the opportunity to ask the waitress what she recommended on the food side of things. Said waitress immediately pointed out the most expensive items on the menu. Annoying, but forgivable.\n\nBy the time the waitress returned with our cocktails, we were ready to order. My dining companion decided to go with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla, which provoked a bit of a face from our waitress and a declaration that it wasn't big enough to work as a main meal (even though it costs as much as most of the mains). Extremely annoying and not terribly forgivable, to be honest.\n\nBut fine, we plowed ahead. My dining companion decided to go with the Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffles, to which we were told that the kitchen had \"run out\" of this item. So that's two things my dining companion attempted to order and twice she was shot down. Not surprisingly, she said she needed a minute to pick something else.\n\nFinally, my turn had come. The reason I had booked this reservation so far in advance. I proudly told the waitress that I wanted the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash. A distressingly sour face ensued and I was told the kitchen was unable to make that, either.\n\nReally. You're a professional kitchen run by a celebrity chef and you don't have TWO items available on a fairly limited menu? Even if I were willing to accept that, I absolutely cannot accept that we weren't told about these unavailable items the second we sat down or, at the very least, before we ordered our cocktails!\n\nFuming, I choked down my cocktail and asked for the bill, assuming the drinks would be comped. No such luck. Instead, our waitress amazingly, brazenly asked if I wanted another drink to go! She just might be the most boldly money-hungry individual I've *ever* met, and I know quite a few lawyers.\n\nWhat a horrible, awful experience and on my birthday no less. Bobby Flay, you are dead to me."

The lounge atmosphere was nice (especially after a long day of travel!).\n\nFirst off, I am less than happy about the reservations setup there. My party had reservations for 10 for 12:30 and arrived about 15 minutes early ... but weren't seated until 15 minutes past our reservations. Given they had known we were coming for nearly a month, and we'd confirmed the reservations earlier that day, they should have made sure everything was ready. The delay *wasn't* because the tables were all full, incidentally - where we sat was empty and clean and waiting for us when we arrived. I'm also less than happy about the upsell for bottled water - they didn't offer ice water when we seated (just bottled water - sparkling or flat) and implied tap water was not available.\n\nMy party ended up ordering the Goat Cheese (\"Queso Fundido\") with rajas and tortilla strips as an appitizer, and getting baskets of bread with a ciobatta, some sort of wheat bread with cranberries in it, and a chile cornbread. The Queso Fundido which was creamy and a little spicy and very delicious, and I could have happily eaten an entire order by myself. It wasn't as spicy as I had expected it to be, but that's ok, it was perfect with the goat cheese. The ciabatta and the wheat bread were great (I did eat almost the entire basket of that). I liked the chile cornbread, but thought it was really weak in the spice department and it was cold in the middle, like they had baked a bunch and froze them and just reheated it for lunch and got it in long enough that it was all thawed and the outsides were warmish, but the middle was still ice cold.\n\n\nFor entrees, many people ordered the Mesa Burger (double cheddar, grilled vidalia onion, and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries). One person ordered the Pressed Cuban Burger (which was a burger with ham, swiss cheese, pickles, dijon mustard, and roasted garlic mayo with adobo fries). I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi, which came with a roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and a pineapple-green onion salsa. One person ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos (with grilled red onion and a peanut smoked chile BBQ sauce), and the person next to me ordered the New Mexico-style Pork Tenderloin Sandwich (with grilled red onion, arugula, ancho-chile mayo, and southwest fries).\n\n\nI quite enjoyed the Mahi Mahi. The pineapple-chile sauce was spicy enough to give a nice kick to the fish, and the pineapple-onion salsa gave a balancing sweetness. I ended up using some bread to mop up the last of the chile sauce because it was that good (and I was that hungry!). Everyone else seemed to quite enjoy their lunches as well.\n\nPrice-wise, there was some grumbling at the end that it was a little expensive for what you get. In my opinion, it cost a little more than I thought it was worth, but not so much that I would never return. The service was good (the reservation and water upselling issues aside), the food was excellent."

We asked a lot of questions, and she had answers for all of them and never seemed in a hurry to move away from us.\n\nAs an appetizer I had the roasted corn soup. It was so wonderfully creamy and tasty that I would have been happy with two more bowls as my entree and desert. It was that good. For my main course I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This had a nice spice rub that had a bit of heat to it. If you don't care for spicy foods you need to stay away from this one. But, if you enjoy a bit of heat then this dish will give you a taste sensation you have probably never had before. The meet was tender and cooked to perfection. The Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce complemented it very well and gave it more depth. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with a Green Chile Queso sauce. This was tasty as well and complemented the pork very nicely. My wife had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chop and loved it.\n\nFor desert my wife and I shared the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. This was a little slice of heaven. The coconut was a nice brown and not heavily caked on the outside. It was just lightly applied. The cake to frosting ratio was nice. There were four layers of cake and the total frosting was about the same as one of the layers. It was nice and thin.\n\nWe both enjoyed ourselves very much. I know we will be going back again."

No tank tops. Boo. My hubby and I were disappointed that we couldn't have the full dining experience, since we ate at the bar.\n\nI love the appetizer breads. My favorite is the corn muffin. Yum! Since we didn't have breakfast, I was practically full from eating bread. \n\nI had the Grilled Mahi Mahi with the roasted pineapple chile sauce, carmelized pineapple - green onion salsa and green chile rice ($24). The mahi mahi was overcooked, so I didn't like the dish too much. In addition, the fish wasn't that large. Way overpriced for lunch. At least the sauces were good. \n\nMy hubby ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with the poached egg and green chile hollaindaise ($18). Yum! This is a very savory dish due to the sweet potato hash. There is some spice to the chicken. I love the presentation of this dish. The texture is a bit mushy due to the shredded chicken and sweet potato. It is like eating baby food. However, the dish is tasty! \n\nI would try this place again for dinner. Hopefully the portions are larger at dinner."

I've described a lot of pork as \"dry and chewy\" but this was the exact opposite. I ordered the duck breast and it was everything I wanted it to be and more. I rarely order duck but the side was a chorizo and goat cheese tamale (!) was too enticing to pass up; it's too bad that was a bit too dry, but the breast made up for it. My other friend ordered the coffee crusted filet mignon, which was super tasty. The pork portion was huge, but the duck was pretty small. So, that was a tad disappointing. The desserts were pretty good (banana cream pie & apple pie), but nothing out of this world at all.\n\nBeware, some of the food is very spicy (duh), which I love but some people could grow tired of the tastebud assault. \n\nThe drinks are ridiculously tasty and strong, though a bit overpriced. The cactus pear margarita was striking and tasted even better. \n\nEven Bobby Flay haters won't be disappointed, trust me."

The dish... well, it was two mounds of mushy, mashed up sweet potato with tiny cubes of chicken mixed into it, topped with two poached eggs, and completely drenched in hollandaise sauce. In my mind, you can never go wrong with a dish with poached eggs. Well, they've proved me wrong. This dish had no texture, and no bold flavors at all. Well, other than the sweetness emanating from the mounds of sweet potato. I'm usually a huge fan of sweet potato, but it was just way too much that it completely overpowers anything else on the plate. I did not taste any hint of spiciness at all. I felt like I was just eating a plate of sweet potato puree, which felt kinda sickening after a while. Needless to say, I did not finish the dish.\n\nThe one redeeming factor: the bread basket. The jalapeno bread was yummy. I'll give them that.\n\nAnother minus: the waiter felt the need to explain to me what a poached egg was after I placed my order. Really?"

So I checked out the menu online and to my surprise, the prices were totally reasonable. Far less than I expected. Entrees ranged anywhere from mid $30's to mid $50's. I'm in.\n\nI ordered a skinny marg, shrimp tamale appetizer, and lamb porterhouse. But tried each of my friend's dishes too cause they looked goooood. My thoughts on everything:\n\nBREAD: 4/5. The jalapeno bread is BOMB. The other two breads were decent.\nMARGARITAS: 5/5. Tried 4 different types and they were all top notch.\nSHRIMP TAMALE: Easily the best tamale I've ever had. This item was expensive ($19 I think) but worth the try imo.\nLAMB PORTERHOUSE: 5/5. One of the best lamb dishes I've ever had. The filet side was melt in your mouth good.\nPORK TENDERLOIN: 5/5. Best pork tenderloin I've ever had.\nNEW YORK STEAK: Cooked to perfection. Nice medium rare with a slight char on the outside. Sauce was bomb.\n\nService was great as well.\n\nMesa Grill is perfect if you want some high quality food but aren't in the mood for a super fancy or expensive dining experience. I will be back for sure."

It's also in one of my favorite Vegas spots, Caesars Palace.\n\nWe started with a delicious Chicken Quesadilla appetizer, but moved into bigger and better items with the main course...\n\nThe girls each ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken with garlic-mango sauce and buttermilk-chive mashed potatoes.  Alby ordered the Grilled Pineapple Mahi Mahi with green chile rice.  And I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbled Pork Tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale.\n\nWe all shared bites with each other.  I thought the Mahi was best, the girls thought the Pork was best.  Alby liked the chicken.  All three items were actually pretty spicy and hot (warning to you wusses out there).  I will say, my sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was untouchable as far as our side dishes went.\n\nDessert was the only blemish on a perfect evening of dining.  We had the Peach Berry Cobbler, and while it was good... the awful ginger ice-cream really put a strange and unnecessary twist to it.\n\nOverall, five stars and a great place for a good meal in Sin City.  Another bonus is that it is next to the Caesars Sports Book if there is any wait for a table..."

My wife and I wanted to try this place simply because we watch way to much of the cooking channel, and we love Bobby Flay! We did the dinner pairing. My wife had the Sophie's salad and I started with the tiger prawn tamale, yum! Main course was 16 spice chicken for my lady and I had the Ancho chilie salmon, both stellar choices! My wife had to pass on the dessert since they pretty much brought out the largest portion of chicken ever served in a restaurant. Being the gluten for punishment that I am I went in on the coconut cake, it was extremely decadent!

Honestly this is the first time I had a veal chop but it wont be the last. I am a fan!!! The chop was expertly prepared, cooked, and presented. More importantly with the accompanying sauce it was also absolutely delicious.\n\nFor dessert we shared an apple cheesecake.

No doubt the food will be full of southwestern flavor.  Dinner started with a bottle of Chimay blue and some duck pancakes.  The pancakes were succulent to say the least.  Very flavorful like tender BBQ pork chunks wrapped in a small thin pancake.  Not sure what it's made of but I'm sure it had blue corn in it.  It is Bobby Flay we're talking about.\n\nThe main dish was rib eye steak.  I ordered medium rare but the waitress suggested medium due to the rarity near the bone.  Seems some people don't like it that rare.    Turns out the inside near the bone was pretty good.  Tender and a small amount of pink.  The only issue was the ends of the rib eye was burnt and cooked all the way through.  Oh well next time I stick with what I know.   The steak was generally minimalist which I like.  Not too much sauce just salt and pepper.  The steak was quite large, enough to share a small piece with 4 others. \n\nThe favors were returned and I got to taste the pork tenderloin.  Now that is a great dish.  Three tender cylinders about one and a half inches in diameter and two inches tall.  How they cook the meat through and keep it so tender with the tasty crust not burned is impressive.\n\nWe all shared the toffee pudding which as tasty.  All in all the dinner was just fun.  The venue is just ultra nice and modern and the atmosphere frou frou.  Of course I had to take a couple of pictures of me knawing on the bone.  This is obviously after two Chimays so I take no responsibility for driving our dinner neighbors away.  LOL.\n\nI expected to pay a bit for such ambience and great service but I would not do this on the regular."

            "review": "Well it took a while, but I finally made time to stop by Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I'm not that big a Flay fan, but I was really interested in trying his food based on the pics I've seen on yelp which look pretty damn creative.\n\nI stopped over for lunch and based on early recommendations from my friends and my own curiosity, I didn't waste any time with ordering.  I started with the Blue Corn Pancake for my appetizer and their Chile Relleno for my entree.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake with Barbecued Duck - with habanero chili and star anise sauce. \nhttp://bit.ly/Y2YRp1\nThis was pretty much like a duck taco.  The duck was very tasty and had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it.  It was really good and I'd order this again.  The only hiccup I had with this was the fact that I ended up chewing on a bone near the end.  That was a red flag and I told my waiter about it.  He was shocked!  The real sucky part about it was that I didn't get any compensation for it.\n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno -  with Roasted Eggplant,  Manchego Cheese \nSweet Red Pepper Sauce, and Balsamic Vinegar\nhttp://bit.ly/VmHanC\nI've had my fair share of Chile Rellenos, but this has got to be the most fanciest Chile Relleno I've ever seen.  And it was good as expected!  The Chile crust had a nice crunch to it while the cheese was nicely melted down.  And to exhibit a little bit of food porn, check out the gooey cheese oozing out from inside.  (http://bit.ly/WYhacm)  Ooooooh yes!!!  \n\nFor the most part, other than that hiccup with the bone in the duck pancake, service was still good.  My waiter was very courteous and always checked on me over the course of my meal.  It would've been nice to have a little compensation or bill removal for the bone which I probably should've requested, but I'm not that aggressive.\n\nI'd probably consider going back again to Mesa Grill to try their other menu items, but it probably won't be for a while.  The food is good, but I'd really have to be in mood for it to go back.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4!"

The pork tenderloin was very perfect and tender, but it's a bit on the spicy side, so only get it if you like it with a kick.  After that, we were full, so we didn't get to try dessert.  Great place to try in Vegas that is pricey but not heart-stoppingly so."

I had wanted to go here for some time, then I was on a job in LV, so we came!! I had the salmon and it was awesome! The caesar salad i had was GREAT too! It is just as pretentious as any other \"nice\" restaurant... they refold your napkin when you get up to pee (or poop... but thats a shame because its great food), and they put the napkin in your lap for you. thank you bobby flay!"

We ordered those 3 dishes and pretty much did family style and everything had such a solid flavor. The cuts of meat are aged for 40 days and cooked beautifully to the medium and medium rare we had requested. Service was great and has been the best steak experience in Vegas for me thus far! \n\nThe chile verde mashed potatoes were so creamy and delicious too!

I asked quite a few people what style of food is served at Mesa and I got a wide variety of answers. Some said American, some said Mexican, but quite a few said Tex-Mex. Since I was kind of confused of what Tex-Mex food was I decided to take a trip down to Caesar's Palace with my girlfriend and give this place a try.\n\nThe restaurant has an amazing atmosphere. I love the d\u00e9cor of this place. Mr. Flay sure has great taste. Once seated we decided to try some appetizers. I ordered the Blue Corn Pancake (barbecued duck with habanero chile-star anise sauce) and my GF got the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido with chips. The Blue Corn Pancake was phenomenal. The sauce on the pancake was great and the bbq duck was nice and tender. The dip my GF got was also very good.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the 22 oz bone in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce and a chorizo goat cheese tamale with thyme butter. This dinner was absolutely perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection and the sauces that accompanied the meat really made this meal an unforgettable one. The chorizo tamale was incredible. My girlfriend got the sixteen spice crusted chicken with mango garlic sauce and mango salsa. The chicken had an exotic taste to it, which my GF enjoyed. For Dessert we shared the cornflake crunch vanilla ice cream with the Mexican chocolate sauce. This dessert was tasty and really hit the spot after such a great meal.\n\nThe service was 5 stars all the way. Our waitress was funny and very informative. \nMesa Grill is a bit on the expensive side but the food and services you receive make it well worth the money. I loved my dining experience at Mesa Grill. I have been back to Mesa a few times since this first trip and each visit has been as wonderful as this first one. Do your self a favor and check out Mesa Grill, you will defiantly not regret it."

From the quesadillas to the tuna steak, all of the flavors were interesting and worked well.  The mango rice on the side of my dish had almost gummy pieces of mango in it, which did not impress me texturally.  My boyfriend wasn't as impressed with the food.  He's not a huge southwestern cooking fan, and Bobby Flay's menu is chock full of southwestern choices.  \n\nSome other positives:  I had perhaps the best dirty martini I've ever had and the server was spectacular.  He asked if we wanted dessert but was not pushy in any way when we declined which I love.  \n\nNegatives:  I didn't love the atmosphere.  It kind of felt like another cheesy restaurant right in the middle of a hotel.  And the really drunk guy that puked all over his coworkers next to us really put a damper on my evening."

            "review": "I actually proposed to my g/f about 15 minutes before our 8PM reservation in our MGM Sky Loft which meant we were celebrating at Mesa Grill.\n\nTo start off we had a mojito, margarita, and the chicken tacos appetizer. The 2 drinks were excellent. Im not a mojito fan but this was drinkable and stiff. The margarita really hit the spot and was overly full of tequila which is my style of drink! THe chicen tacos were awesome, 3 little breasts on skewers that came with 3 small tortillas, glazed onions, and a bbq sauce of some kind. A great way to start off!\n\nFor our entree we ordered the coffee rubbed filet and I had the salmon. THe filet was cooked to perfections with loads of flavor and looked like a masterpiece on the plate. The salmon was just as perfect, cooked exactly how I like (mid rare) with a great crisp crust on the top and bottom from a good sear. \n\nWe also had a la carte chille relleno and twice baked potatoe. Nothing too crazy but needed something on the side besides just the entree. The chile relleno was different with a hard corn meal like crust with bean/corn mash textured filling. Was different but good. The twice baked potatoe was better than a normal one.\n\nDessert we didnt really want but we had to do it just to do it! We had the churros which we were glad we ordered. Hot and cripsy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. To top it off it came with a chocolate sauce to dip the churros in. \n\nOverall this was a top notch resturaunt with top notch service. One thing my g/f pointed out that was over the top was the fact she was wearing a black dress, she was initially given a white napkin and then the waitress came back and swapped her napkin with a black one. Now thats paying attention to detail."

While I enjoyed very much the cactus pear margarita and the goat cheese queso fundido, I was very disappointed by our server as well as the quality of the Mesa Burger my husband and I shared. \nLet me start with our server. If his presentation style was anymore negative about what WASN'T available on the menu that afternoon, we might have left had we not really wanted to try your food and been as hungry as we were. It's one thing to be out of something but it was the WAY he said it. \"Just so you know and don't get your heart set on it, we are OUT of the ribs. They aren't that good anyway\" was how it was presented. Hmmm. Not good. He then described the Tuna \"Nachos\" as being more Tuna tar-tar with a side of tortilla chips and said \"unless you like raw tuna, this isn't for you\". Um...ok. You get the point. This guy clearly needed some training. And I won't throw him under the bus and name him here but email me if you want to know more.\nAs for the burger. I'll go back to our server....we ordered the burger to share and ordered it medium well. He repeated it back to us, medium well and confirmed we wanted to split the order. When the burger arrived, it was all on one plate. I figured he didn't tell the expediter or just didn't note it on the order. We wait a couple minutes and he finally appears with 2 plates and a knife for us to split the burger ourselves. Um...ok. I cut into the burger and it is rare. Ok, rare is an understatement. It was raw. Blood raw. Definitely NOT medium well like we ordered and he confirmed. So we had to flag down a waiter as ours had conveniently disappeared. He came back and said that we had told him medium rare. Um...no we didn't. We never eat anything rare and he had repeated back to us what we wanted which is why I knew he knew what we ordered and just wanted to put it on us. So a new burger came a few minutes later and while that wasn't medium well either, it was a lot better than the raw that we got initially. Unfortunately, your chefs feel the need to ridiculously overseason the burgers to the point where you can hardly taste the burger itself. And the fries? Ugh. An over-seasoned, over fried mess. There was a coating on the fries that totally took away from the potato flavor of the fries. \nQuite honestly, this first visit to one of your restaurants was a huge disappointment. I expect more from someone of your caliber and while you didn't cook any of this yourself, this was a representation of your brand. I don't know if that is fair or not, but I guess if you are going to put yourself in the position of being on a pedestal by being on television, you need to hold those who are running your brand to a higher standard. If this is what your restaurants are putting out, I think that you need to spend less time at Food Network and MORE time in your restaurants.  Please read my review on Holsteins and visit their restaurant to see how to really get things done. \nThanks for reading this and I hope you will take it to heart....even though I figure you'll probably never see this and those who really should see it won't really do anything about it. Good luck..."

            "review": "I'm doing the unthinkable.\n\nI'm giving Bobby Flay five stars.\n\nI didn't want to like Mesa Grill. I saw it on the Las Vegas Michelin guide and told the boy, \"I can't believe they gave Bobby Flay of the Food Network a star. How can simple Southwestern food compare to the complexity of French food?\"\n\nWell, I was wrong.\n\nMesa Grill is many things, but simple is not one of them.\n\nStarting with the bread basket, you could tell this was going to be something interesting. Amidst the bread lay a yellow and blue corn cornbread muffin, filled with little pieces of corn and peppers. The boy had problems buttering his cornbread so he didn't enjoy it as much, but I really liked it. Even the white bread had bits of jalapenos in it, adding a definite kick to the start of your meal.\n\nNext, the appetizers. We ordered the blue corn pancake with barbecued duck (sort of like a BBQ peking duck) and a goat cheese chorizo tamale. Neither did it for me, but who cares about the appetizers? I was too distracted by their margaritas.\n\nHere's a word of wisdom to everyone who is thinking about coming to Mesa Grill: ORDER A MESA GRILL MARGARITA.\n\nAfter trying a Mesa Grill margarita, I'm not quite sure if I can drink anything else. Their margaritas are what a margarita should taste like - top shelf tequila (it was smoother than some vodka I drink!), fresh lime juice, quality salt...it was totally light, totally refreshing...If only they made yard long drinks of THAT.\n\nAnyway, back to the meal - the boy ordered the dry rubbed pork tenderloin while I had the pan seared halibut. The boy's pork tenderloin was tender. Actually, tender doesn't even begin to describe it - every time I took a bite, it had the texture of filet mignon. Just the way they prepared it was mindblowing. My halibut was flakey and moist, but if I could have done it all over again, I would have ordered the tenderloin too.\n\nThe thing I think I love the most about Mesa Grill is that the whole experience is unlike anything else I've tried. You can't compare the flavors to anything else - everything we tasted was in your face, upfront and bold...\n\n....Almost like Bobby Flay's personality.\n\nWow. I've been converted."

The service was friendly and down to earth, which I like.  \nBobby Flay has a unique perspective to cooking and a lot of passion.  I can't go to Vegas without eating here.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.\n\nI encourage Yelp reviewers that gave Mesa Grill a poor review to try it one more time.  I think Vegas inherently is very unpredictable and volatile.  This place is truly good.\n\nUpdate:  I went to Mesa Grill for a 3rd time and had to downgrade two stars.  They removed my favorite dish:  the coffee been rubbed steak, so my steak became average and please don't give me steak sauce unless you're serving me a piece of leather.  I was also disappointed by the sides.  The cauliflower au gratin was gross and the butternut squash tamale is wimpy."

No need to have their nose up in the air with folks in town for a conference. So that was my initial impression. The Host was very crude upon us entering the restaurant with a laptop case & INSISTED, we couldn't take it to the dining room. Which is totally fine, but no need to bite our heads off. Just tell us where to put it! \n\nOur server must have been new or just a chatter box, but it took him about 10+ mins to go through the menu (which isn't very big in the first place) ps. Have a mint! \n\nFood: Corn Soup was darn good (my co-worker ordered that). I had the grilled Asparagus salad which was nice & refreshing. \n\nFor my meal i had the tiger shrimp tamale. I gotta say, A+! sooo yummy! the tamale itself was perfectly made, the taste was very light & the fresh corn--YUM! \nOhh the fries - another great treat. Dessert - Coconut cake - HOLY MOLY, light, fresh, not tooo sweet, but just darn good! \n\nOverall food was good...service was lackluster"

It's pretty rich, and I didn't even finish it. \n\nThe portions are pretty generous and his sauces are amazing. Everything has just the amount of fire to it! I ordered the pork with the sweet potato tamale. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and we were stuffed to our max capacity! \n\nCute bartender and really friendly staff.

            "review": "I have been wanting to try Mesa Grill forever especially after having a great experience at Bar Americain in New York. So my husband and I and two friends decided to try brunch at Mesa Grill. The restaurant, though small, was very hip and I loved the decor and the bright colors. \nMy husband ordered the sweet potato hash with poach eggs and green chili hollendaise, I ordered the chiliquiles, home fries and also a peach bellini. We were surprised when a bread basket was brought to our table with a variety of breads. One appeared to be a coffee cake, one a blue corn cornbread, one a jalapeno biscuit, and I can't remember what the other was. All were good except the blue corn cornbread which was a little dry. The peach bellini was good but it was very small. I kept eying my friends margarita thinking that I should have gotten that since it was the same price and significantly bigger. The sweet potato hash with poached eggs was amazing and I was sad that I didn't order it. The chiliquiles that I ordered were ok, but could have used more egg. Our friends ordered a burger and the breakfast enchilada's. While the burger looked pretty good and was fairly big, the enchilada's looked really dry and there was very little food on the plate. \nI decided to try the chocolate corn bread pudding for the sake of trying something a little different. It was ok but I was expecting it to be more like an actual bread pudding. The texture was a bit strange and in my opinion, it tasted like a chocolate cake that had not been baked long enough. \nAll in all, I would say our experience was simply ok. I am glad we went there for brunch which is when the meals are the cheapest but didn't feel that most of the food was worth it for what you paid. On the other hand, the service was actually great and I would still consider going back just to order the sweet potato hash with poached eggs."

We also had the corn side dish and the risotto and both were absolutely delicious.We topped it off with the chocolate cake that I cannot even describe in words. Just gooey chocolate\nGoodness.

I'm a big Bobby Flay fan and have always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants. This one did not disappoint. The bread brought out before our meal was delicious. There were three types: a blue corn (we think?) cornbread, a raisin sweeter bread and I think a sourdough. All amazing. For our starter, we chose the tuna nachos. Warning: they're not really nachos. It's (delicious) tuna tartare with blue and white corn chips. For our main course, we chose to split the pork tenderloin. If you're hungry, don't split the entree; it's not enough. But we were still full from lunch so the 3 pieces in our entree was perfect for us to split. The pork had a perfectly seared crust and was so tender on the inside. And the sauce that accompanied it was amazing. We are it slowly to savor every bite. We also got the roasted corn side. It was perfect for two people to split and delicious; just a hint of spice. We were too full for dessert but it looked delicious. This was definitely one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while."

So when I learned I would be vacationing in Vegas, I knew this place was a must but after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was skeptical.\n\nAnd I had every right to be. \n\nWe went in early in the afternoon, around 1:30pm. First of all, when we got to the Forum Shops/Caesars Palace we weren't sure where to go. We checked the directory and Mesa wasn't on it! So we asked a girl at a gellato stand. She directed us to go all the way down to the bottom of the Forum Shops. When we made our way there, we still couldn't find it and had a man tell us we had to go all the way back! Frusterated, we went outside and walked to the front of Caesers, went inside and finally found it. But when we finished and took a left, we walked right into the Forum Shops where we first started out, right by the gellato stand where we got directions the first time! I don't know if she wasn't educated on the layout or simply was tired of having people ask for directions and sent us on a wild goose chase. Either way, it was very frustering.\n\nAs for the actual restaurant, we were seated right away. Like previous reviews, the seating/tables are very close to each other, I'm sure so they can pack in as many diners as possible. \n\nService was okay, nothing to write home about. \n\nNow, the food......oh, the food. I ordered the famous Pork Tenderloin sandwich, as I LOVE spicy food and the server told us it was probably the spiciest dish on the menu. Um, really? It had almost NO spice, and really no flavor whatsoever. The fries were overdone and just not very good. My boyfriend ordered the burger, which was WAY better than what I ordered and I ended up finishing it for him. He also was not impressed with the fries.\n\nBefore I forget, the bread basket was very disappointing. I was looking forward to the jalapeno bread and it was soggy and not spicy even though I could see the bits of jalapeno in it. The rest of the bread was also meh. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I had the experiance but I won't be back to Mesa Grill. Sorry, Bobby."

I can definitely understand how others came up with 3.5 or 4 star review.\n\nWe have been watching Bobby on the food network forever and I have been to Mesa grill in New York, but wasn't exactly blown away. \n\nThe \"Vegas Experience\" far exceeded our expectations. \n\nThe vibe is cool, it's very laid back and not nearly as stuffy as many of the high end restaurants in Vegas. You can walk in there wearing jeans and a t shirt (as I did b/c I left my freshly pressed collared shirt in the rental car) without a smug or dirty look from the host/hostess. \n\nThe Food:\n\nBread (off the hook, give me more please)\nFreshly baked varieties including  an amazing raisin bread, sourdough with cheddar and jalapeno and a freshly baked soft and moist corn muffin\n\nRoasted Corn Soup\nExcellent smoky, roasted corn flavors, very light and well seasoned. Excellent start to the evening\n\nBBQ Duck Blue Corn Pancake\nLots of duck in this bad boy. Duck was very tender, well seasoned and the blue corn pancake, although a bit soggy, was a nice touch.\n\nFire Roasted Veal Chop\nThe most delicious, succulent, tender chop of veal I have EVER tasted. Topped with a spicy sauce that was truly incredible and a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and tart\n\nNew Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin\nGF ordered this one and she asked for it well done. I know, I know, I tried to help her understand that medium or medium rare pork is not a good idea, unless you are visiting a fine dining establishment such as this one. Despite the fact that it was well done (and cooked perfectly considering the fauz pas) this dish was killer! It was tender, spicy, sweet contrast and just delicious, served with a tangy and spicy BBQ sauce that was an excellent compliment to the dish. \n\nCoconut Cake\nThis cake is moist, soft, spongy and amazing! As many non coconut fans are thinking (I hate coconut) not to worry. It's the freshest combination of coconut flavor and sweetness, with an piping hot (luke warm) cup of coffee, makes for the perfect dessert. Had I not given up drinking years ago, I would have enjoyed a glass of Port with this dessert and it would have been the perfect yin to this sweet and tasty yang. \n\nOur waiter and the entire wait staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, to make our date night/pre show experience very special.\n\nI honestly hope that those of you reading this are treated in the same exact manner we were b/c the experience was sensational and definitely wallet friendly, considering where you are in the world of celebrity cheftastic restaurants."

From the hip decor, to the amazing margaritas, to the food - its all great!\n\nWe came here with a group of 6, pre Absinthe show, for dinner. We had attentive yet laid back service. I highly recommend the mezcal margarita if you are a mezcal fan. One of my favorite dishes, as random as it is, was the side of roasted corn. It was the best. I also loved my lamb chops. \n\nThis is a good place for a group, as well as a more intimate date. Located right in the middle of Caesars, its also convenient, yet still in the action."

I'd have to give the break basket 5 stars and the food 4 stars - but don't get me wrong, the food was super amazing!  I had the famous Mesa burger w/ the double cheddar and onions and horseradish - and normally I don't like horseradish, but on this burger - it was amaaaazing!  The fries also was a great side addition to the burger and I completely devoured my whole meal and licked my fingers and plate clean!  \n\nAnd I completely understand that people are saying that it's overpriced, but I already knew before dining here that it'd be that way.  BUT thank goodness the food was delicious, otherwise I would have given this place less stars.  But if you're ever here in Vegas, you defnitely gotta try this place out - even if it's just for a drink, as for the basket of bread and you won't be disappointed!"

I came with a bachelorette party (about 10 total) and we had great service. \n\nThis club consisted of avocados ( I loveeeee avocados! ) tomatos, bacon, and chipotle aioli. Also came with a side of fries. \n\nI ate half of it because I was going to a pool party and didn't want my stomach bulging out like the night before when I went to eat at a buffet. Oh man I learned my lesson - I was too full to function. But that's a different story. So I was hoping to eat the other half when I wanted some drunk munchies. \n\nMy cousins ordered burgers and other items and they all loved it.  \n\nThis sandwich was so good that when I came back drunk from the club, all I was kept saying was \"I want my sandwich\" over and over while stumbling and rolling on the bed, according to my cousin. \n\nI can't wait to come back!"

I can't even THINK about your stuffed squash blossoms or your corn. So simple in concept and yet executed with such brilliance, an explosion of flavor nearly knocks me unconscious. I could stop there but you have entrees. Unbelievably delicious entrees. \n\nOK, Bobby, where is this crossroads in which you clearly made a pact with the devil at?

The food has high-end Chef written all over it.. small servings, high-priced, but amazing flavor.\nAs you are seated, you are given a basket of different breads and muffins that are super tasty and different.\nThe YELP popular smoked salmon quesadilla is fantastic. At first glance, it looks like a simple dish that's bound to disappoint but no, this is some quality smoked salmon on top of a well-grilled quesadilla. \nThe chilaquiles is okay.. nothing special and was kind of cold. \nThe Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash was pretty good. Loved the hollandaise sauce on it.\n\nAmbiance: A colorful, classy restaurant with a wide-open space and views of the casino on one side and the kitchen staff doing their art on the other. Located in front of the giant sportsbook/pokerroom area of Caesars, this is a pretty restaurant with lots of appeal just from the outside. A good place for a social brunch whether you're with your significant or with a group of friends. \n\nService: Servers are very professional and friendly. They come by our table frequently to check on us. The food takes a lonnnngggg time to be served. I don't know if it's because they take their time to cook the food perfectly but the restaurant wasn't crazy busy and it was a bit of a wait.\n\nTips: If you're here for brunch, you HAVE TO try the smoked salmon quesadillas. Come earlier for brunch because the restaurant tends to get very busy during the peak of lunch."

Well...the chopped salad was pretty mediocre, and too filling with all the red kidney beans it it. The table breads and muffins were too dry, kind of inedible.\n\nDuck pancake...like someone had poured half a bottle of cheap, sweet syrup on it so who knows what the duck tasted like.\n\nThe porterhouse lamb chops - very good. This was by far the best thing I had. The lamb was perfectly grilled, and the sauce was inoffensive so you could enjoy the meat. \n\nDessert - that warm, pudding-like cake that I can't remember. It was good, and chocolate. Like many restaurants they served the dessert and then came around asking for coffee as kind of an afterthought. The coffee service took so long that it was tough to wait on eating the cake. Dang, I like coffee WITH dessert. But, most restaurants haven't figured out how to serve both at around the same time.\n\nThe restaurant is a nice spot in Caesars so I don't want to dissuade people from going. But, I'd make the grilled meat the centerpiece of what you order and not get too high on hope for the rest, based on what I experienced. And get a nice bottle of wine to go with it!"

And in some ways, I do.  But there are also some issues.\n\nThe ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  But the tables were packed in pretty tight.  Hey, I understand why.  The place was full on a Tuesday night!  If you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it's just smart business.  But it isn't my taste.\n\nMy wife and I decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.\n\nSome dishes were what you might call \"just fine\":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than \"just fine.\"  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.\n\nSo, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  But when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and Mesa doesn't quite get there.  Lots of Vegas restaurants do get there.  So we won't be back at Mesa for a while.  Sorry, Bobby.  We'll catch you at Bar Americain next time we're in New York."

As it turned out we could not have had a better meal or better service. Our server was a young man with a great personality who knew the food and wine menu well. We all selected different entrees and all were cooked to perfection. My filet was seasoned with one of Bobby's rubs which was spicy but not hot and had great flavor. My baked potato was not your mommas type of baker, it too had a special seasoning and along with the filet and a chopped salad was almost too much to eat. Everyone agreed that our meal at Bobby's was as good as we have had anywhere. Lunch or dinner, this is a good bet as you well get in Vegas."

Grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. Bloody Mary was good but simple and average, I think my expectations may have been a little high on that one. I also had the house margarita which was below average at best - it was so forward on triple sec I couldn't even finish it.\n\nWe sit down, waiter comes, he was very nice throughout. We order and I tell him I would like the Chilaquiles but not with scrambled eggs. He tells me that I can't change the eggs in that dish or any other dish on the menu in fact. Since poached eggs are pretty much the kings of brunch, I was a bit surprised by this. He went on to explain that the dishes are prepared and put together specifically and changing the eggs would change the dish so they don't do it. Show of hands - who actually prefers scrambled eggs? People who are scared of runny yolks, sure, but people who actually enjoy eating eggs - I would venture a guess never order them scrambled.\n\nSo I order the steak and eggs because it is the only way I can get none scrambled eggs. My friends order as well, a bread basket is brought and it is as delicious as everyone said. Then the waiting begins.\n\nWe waited at least 25 minutes for our food. We waited so long that one in our party had to leave early to go to the airport. They gave us a small percentage off for the waiting. \n\nAll in all the food was just average. My eggs were luke warm by the time we got our food and although the steak was good overall it wasn't anything special. Nothing that anyone got was really stood out.\n\nMaybe the limited, inflexible brunch menu hindered our experience but overall between that and the long wait for a restaurant that wasn't even full my experience at Mesa Grill fell far short of my high expectations."

The iron chef blew my mind! \n\nMy boyfriend and I made lunch reservations and we were promptly seated even though we got there about fifteen minutes early. The service continued to be wonderful. We were being very clumsy that day - I accidentally spilled my glass of water and my boyfriend dropped his knife on the floor and each time they ran over and replaced the things we needed. I kept apologizing for spilling but the waiter was very nice and told me not to worry about it. \n\n Both of us decided to order from the prix fixe menu, since that would give us the most bang for our buck (three courses for $30). My boyfriend ordered the sweet potato soup topped with smoked chiles, maple crema, and marcona almonds for his appetizer and the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich for his entree. I had the tiger shrimp, roasted garlic, corn tamale with cilantro sauce for my appetizer. I have always lived in places that have given me the best access to fresh seafood, but this was seriously the best shrimp I have ever had in my life! Then I had the pan seared wild striped bass with roasted yellow pepper grits and yellow pepper romesco. All the flavors were so complex. There were so many sauces - spicy, sweet, salty, creamy - it really made the food exciting! We topped it all off with vanilla bean panna cotta with macerated berries. They let the berries soak in grand marnier for two days. YUM! \n\nWe were so stuffed by the end that we practically had to roll out of the restaurant, but the deal was so good that we could not resist (plus we did not need to spend money for dinner that night).

I had a burger and my husband had a pork sandwich it was really good. Oh yeah, Bobby Flay just so happened to be there when we were eating lunch! Will visit again next time we go to Vegas and maybe try their dinner."

            "review": "Bobby Flay...the hopes I had for Mesa...what hopes indeed.  Despite one of my friends disdain for Bobby Flay's personality as it appears on television, I was able to convince her and two others to join me for lunch at Mesa by promising an incredible meal.  Unfortunately Mesa didn't deliver that incredible meal, so I failed to follow through with my promise.\n\nPossibly the most disappointing was the bbq duck crepes.  On paper it sounds marvelous, but it actually tastes like an Ar-B-Q sandwich from Arby's -- honestly indiscernible.  There were more failures however.  While glazing things with miso has recently become popular, Mesa would not be a reason for this, as their miso-glazed salmon was absolutely terrible.  It has an odor reminiscent of ammonia, and a flavor that nearly matched.\n\nWe continued with our gastronomical hopes of grandeur but were continuously let down.  Some items were so forgettable, that I've actually forgotten all the different dishes we ate.  One dish in particular comes to mind as probably the second most disappointing of the meal; the sweet potato and duck hash.  Appealing in name, but the final product does not deliver.  The texture of the sweet potato was closer to baby food than to that of a hash, and the duck's flavor was smothered by the remnants of sweet potato suffocating my taste buds.\n\nOverpriced hype.\n\nBobby Flay, I challenge you to a throwdown."

I'll be going back to Vegas sooner than I would have otherwise just to have it again.  The sweet potato tamale was heavenly, although next time I'll get more pecan butter.  My mom got the rib eye without all the sauces and it was one of the tastiest pieces of beef I've ever had.  It was much better than the flavorless filet my dad had, but then if you're looking for a tasty piece of cow, you don't order filet.  I also loved the blue corn muffin and the prickly pear iced tea.  \n\nThe rest of my family had tickets to see Bette Middler, conveniently located just feet from Mesa Grill, so we didn't have time for appetizers or desserts.  It hurts me to think about what I missed, but I take comfort in the fact that while they were watching Ms. Middler sing her heart out, I was in my hotel room eating their leftovers.\n\nupdate- I just got the Mesa Grill cookbook from Costco.  It's that good.  I'll be heading back to Vegas just to eat there and see O."

Very modern, bright and open, it's Caesar's Palace and they really wanted Bobby Flay; as tasteful and modern as Southwestern can git.\n\nWe went for lunch late on a Wed afternoon during a conference break and it was surprisingly slow there at 1:45. Breadbasket is delicious of course with those Jalapeno corn muffins, beautiful works of art at half yellow and blue corn swirl. We started by splitting the Blue Corn pancake BBQ Duck which was smoky with low heat and just yummy.\nFor our entrees we had a Lamb chopped salad and a Chili Releno that looked even better than it tasted, and it tasted fantastic. They manage to get a very light batter on the chili and then somehow seal it with the cheese inside so that it 'blows up\", really impressive. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and the salad good sized for what are generally small portions here. Presentation all Bobby Flay.\n\nService from Michael was attentive, even relaxed considering there wasn't a dozen people in the restaurant, so come late our usual plan. They are definitely pushing drinks like most Vegas restaurants and you can see the disappointment in their faces when we order our usual lunch time iced tea and a water with lemon, no ice.\n\nHighly recommended and not crazy pricey, but still a $75 lunch with one appetizer and two entrees and one ice tea. Do it."

The bread basket was good and came with blue corn and bell pepper muffins.  I ordered the corn soup to start and the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla.  The corn soup was excellent and had a spicy kick from the chipotle cream.  Quesadillas seem so pedestrian, but I was dying to try a Bobby Flay quesadilla.  Frankly, this was a bit disappointing because the tortilla seemed overcooked and slightly burnt.  The smoked chicken component was good, but I couldn't find much black bean.  Overall, this dish was underwhelming.  I also sampled my friend's veal, which was excellent.  The lobster tacos were very good but also very small.  I'd recommend Mesa Grill if you like dolled up Southwestern fare - just skip the quesadilla."

Admittedly, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, located in the very heart of the Caesar's Palace casino is a virtual retreat from the chaos of the environment just steps outside the door. \n\nWith a cool Southwestern decor, we were seated and provided with enthusiastic, if not somewhat pushy service.  Our waiter strongly suggested a margarita as they are the house specialty, which we passed on, honestly due to the exorbitant price point.  The open kitchen provides nice entertainment and the ability to see your dinner being prepared with care is a welcome touch.  For us, we order one entree, three appetizers and two sides.  Everything served was declious, but small in portion.  I would say the secret is in the sauce, as every sauce was worth practically licking the plate.\n\nMy pescetarian daughter forewent her devotion and love of the sea to try the barbecue duck in a blue corn tortilla and never looked back.  She could only say, \"Yum!\"  The tiger shrimp appetizer was equally enjoyed for its taste and aesthetic presentaition.\n\nOur other daughter delightfully received a beautiful side of sweet potato gratin, which was served in a small skillet, crisp on the top; both sweet and spicy.  Her lobster tacos were literally the size of three fingers, but incredibly flavorful with a hint of citrus and overall lobster goodness.\n\nSplitting the salmon, which the watier said should be served medium was delicious but a bit rare for me.  He went on to ask about our choice of side, when sides are actually ala carte.  We chose the sauteed spinach, which was fine.\n\nAll in all, Bobby Flay should be pleased with the chefs cooking the entrees, as they seemed to devote a great deal of care and Flay style by occasionally dousing the food with a ring of water and/or oil, only to cover it with a metal top to \"steam\" the particular entree dish.  We enjoyed our dinner and agreed that the flavor and ambience were memorable, but wished for a bit more satisfying portion in line with the price point."

Hand crafted margaritas are featured on the drink menu, and the dinner menu is built on a foundation of corn and chili spiced proteins.\n\nWe wanted something with tequila in it ASAP, and were happy with the margarita and basket of house bread and blue corn muffin that arrived.\n\nWe started with the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos. Fresh, light, and delicate in texture, the two bite tacos were tasty though perhaps missing their lobster flavor.\n\nFor Entrees we tried the Ancho Chili-Honey Glazed Salmon which I asked for medium-rare, and the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, served medium, with Sweet Potato Tamale.  The salmon was super tender and moist, but unexpectedly mild in flavored, we couldn't really taste the glaze.  The pork tenderloin was incredibly tender and juicy and we used the tamale to sop up the sauces.\n\nThe entrees come ala carte so you'll want to get some sides, we tried the Roasted Corn and Collard Greens.  The Roasted Corn is a superstar.  Sweet summer corn is roasted, but still crunchy, creamy and spiced from the aioli, brightened with lime and cilantro, and sprinkled with salty, tangy cotija cheese.  The collared greens were pretty standard, but made us feel like we ate our vegetables.\n\nOverall we liked Mesa Grill.  The food was well prepared and service was attentive and helpful.  This would be a great place to eat and drink with friends."

Worth noting, as I was hoping to get the Pork Tenderloin, and my wife was hoping to get the pressed Cuban burger- neither was available on the brunch menu.\n\nThat being said, holy crap so good. I watch Top Chef regularly, but I'm not the most adventurous eater out there (don't like seafood, I'm weird like that). So what I liked most about this place is that the food has the quality, taste and presentation you'd expect from a professional, but it's all riffs on food you already know and like.\n\nThe highlight was definitely the breakfast quesadilla- two very crispy tortillas with bacon, cheese, hash browns, chiles and onion goodness, with salsa and an egg on top to crack and let the yolk run over it (not usually my thing, but worked great here). Just layer upon layer of flavor and texture.\n\nWith the lunch menu unavailable, I got the pork tenderloin sandwich and my wife got their standard burger. The fries were actually the highlight, very crispy and well seasoned with a unique smokey flavor. My sandwich was very good, but not at the level of the quesadilla (same with my wife's burger).\n\nAll this said, I can't wait to come back and get the dishes we were hoping to get from the lunch menu. If you're a steak and potatoes kind of guy but want to try something that looks and tastes more gourmet, this is the place to visit."

It must have been pissed off when it left because it took quite a few things with it. The delicious mojito is gone too, its been replaced by a horrible sour mess, that was hardly drinkable. It tasted like cheap sour mix from the grocery store with a piece of mint on top We really should have just left after tasting the mojito and finding out that my main squeeze item, the quesadilla, was gone. We should have thought about the time we stopped in for brunch and the chef refused to fry my eggs instead of poaching them. I'm not a poached egg fan, but its never really been an issue as never in my life has a chef refused to fry an egg, the chef did offer to scramble them, but it felt more like a smack in the face than an accommodation, because seriously, if you can scramble an egg why the hell cant you fry it up over easy? That brunch was upsetting but our love of the quesadilla and perhaps the strength of the mojitos made us brush it aside, however, our last meal at Mesa was just so bad and boring and just so really disappointing. The replacement quesadilla made with chorizo and artichoke hearts was pretty bland and by that I mean almost tasteless, as were the formerly magnificent yucatan chicken tacos. It felt like food you might get at a TGI Fridays or Chili's. Having a bad meal is bad enough on its own, paying a ton of money for said bad meal is even worse, but having bad meal that you paid a ton of money for in Las Vegas where really great restaurants abound is just heartbreakingly sad. It is a frustrating waste of money and stomach space that momentarily makes you envious of those lucky anorexics who only need a hair clip and two sturdy fingers to say bye bye to a bad meal. I'm looking forward to my next Vegas trip, but I dont think Mesa grill will be a part of it."

I came on a Friday at about 11:45am and it wasn't too crowded, but by the time I left around 12:30pm, it seemed like quite the place to be, especially for business lunches/convention attendees. \n\nI went with chicken eggs benedict, which is supposedly very similar to their brunch dish.  I wanted to try to get a feel for brunch without coming on a weekend.  I did just that with this delicious dish with a nice spiciness that you usually don't get from traditional brunch options.  My meal came with three options of bread as well: raisin, jalapeno, and corn.  The jalapeno was the only one in which I would recommend; the other two were just eh.\n\nMy benedict was a very good option.  The other meals at Mesa Grill looked good and portion sizes were excellent.  At $18 for my meal, I think it was probably $3 too expensive, but celebrity chefs are able to get away with that.  Drink options were pretty limited and started at $14 so I didn't even try.  \n\nMesa Grill has some very interesting dishes with a totally different flare.  They also have quick and great service all around.  You will surely pay a little too much for the meal but if you're craving a New Mexican style entree on strip, this is by far your best bet."

Do not avoid the pork, at all costs.\n\nIn summary: get the pork or at the very least, die trying."

She didn't even order that entree, ending up getting three sides instead (what I will call the guacamole peas, the spinach, and the potato) and she was amazed at the food. \nI had the grilled lamb and poblano chili. Magnificent. Probably the most beautiful and best tasting meat I've ever eaten. The waiter was good too. Beverages were excellent: perfectly made margaritas and mixed drinks.\n\nThe cons are the fact this place is surrounded by old smelly Caesar's Palace. My eyes were burning with cigarette smoke by the time we got to the entrance (which is easy to walk past, if you hit Muhammed Ali coming from the north you've gone too far.)\n\nAlso: Two people and four drinks were $260 after tip. This is not a cheap place to eat, but totally worth it. Service was excellent."

I would definitely recommend this place to some one who is taking out a group of people that might be picky eaters or in other words not necessarily foodies.  Not to say a \"foodie\" wouldn't love it, everything I have had here has been executed perfectly and has been delicious it's just that the menu isn't crazy fancy, which is good.  It's a bobby flay restaurant so you get the southwest influence which is typically a crowd pleaser also.  I recommend the shrimp tamale appetizer, pork tenderloin, and the veal chop.  It also isn't terribly pricey for a nice strip restaurant and has a cool atmosphere.\n\nI haven't had the brunch but it's only on the weekends and it looks real good."

I suggest splitting a few appetizers before your entree (blue corn duck pancakes, tiger shrimp tamales). You get a variety of fresh bread and muffins before you order. Good wine selection and strong cocktails. I've ordered the Ribeye twice... once it was the best steak I ever had the second time it was a little too fatty. Filet minon is good as well. I don't normally order desserts but you have to at MESA. Churro's, coconut cake etc are great... The menu choices change with the seasons. If you go with a large party 10 or more you get a private room. PS- Make reservations at least 30 days in advance!"

The place was packed, but I was on a business dinner so I am sure that they made reservations.  I found it funny when they said that our table was not ready and motioned that we can sit in the bar area and get drinks, but the second we ordered the table was miraculously ready.  I see this a lot so no worries.  I started with the queso dip and OMG it was liquid gooey crack.  So damn good and I couldn't stop eating it.  I wanted a steak but passed on it and got the lamb chops only because it came with a tamale side and the steaks had a side extra for $10.00.  I did notice when others ordered that when you get a side it is enough for two people.\n\nThe bread was really good especially the blue corn muffins, I could have stayed there and ate the whole basket.\n\nThe meal came and it was very good with perfect portion sizes.  It was busting with flavors.  My only complaint, or more like a warning and if I could take a 1/2 star away I would is that there are too many flavors.  Remember this is Bobby Flay that we are talking about.  If you are in the mood for a nice basic steak, go somewhere else, if you want a piece of fish with a basic cream sauce go somewhere else.  Here you will get spice, seasonings and peppers, not bad at all but just depends on what your mood is.\n\nThe service was some of the best that I ever saw and the crew was very helpful.\n\nI am glad that I had a chance to visit Mesa Grill!!!"

As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)

Had I known of the Food Network association beforehand I would have worried about things like over-priced, over-hyped mediocre food that plagues many \"famous\" Las Vegas establishments. \n\nHaving said that, this meal was a solid 4 stars. We had the Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla for an appetizer (although our server really tried to push the Tiger Shrimp on us... maybe next time) which was good, although I would have preferred the flour tortillas a little less burnt. For the main course I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and it was phenomenal. I ordered the pork medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The dish itself was a little too spicy for my tastes, but I can definitely still appreciate it. The main attraction for me was the Sixteen Spice Chicken which my boyfriend got. This was hands down the best chicken I have ever had in my entire life. I don't really know what else to say besides that. \n\nThe entrees really brought up my opinion of this restaurant. I will say the margaritas were just decent - the white peach was my favorite, and the house was way, way too sweet. Skipped dessert too as nothing really looked good to me (and I never skip dessert), but then again I'm not usually a fan of Mexican inspired sweets so that's definitely not Mesa's fault. And at ~$100/person, we didn't need dessert anyway."

I decided to try Mesa Grill cause it would be fun to say we tried a restaurant of a famous chef we all know from food network, Bobby Flay.\n\nFirst off, I was slightly annoyed that we had to wait to be seated at our reserved table because not all members of our party were there yet. Our party was ONLY 3 people. My friend and I had to wait in the lounge for over 30 minutes because only one person was late, due to the crazy traffic on the strip. Really? Couldn't we just sit at our table that we reserved and be more comfortable to chit chat? I'd understand if our party was like 6 people and only two people were there to check in to sit in the lounge area.\n\nWe got drinks in the mean time, which were very good, the classic margarita and the mojito. \n\nFor dinner, my friend ordered the pork tenderloin, which is a popular hit. The waiter will suggest that the pork loin is best when served pink, so my friend went a long with his suggestion. When the pork loin came out, it was REALLY pink, rare pretty much. She is not the person to really say anything and toughs it out usually, but she actually had to ask them to take it back and make it well done. The server was nice enough to take it back to the kitchen and served her a well done version, which did not disappoint. The meat was still very delicious and tender. Then towards the end of our meal, we noticed that table next to us had to send their pork tenderloin back too because it was too rare. So quick tip for this is to not get the pork loin rare or ask for medium well, its still very good well done. I had the lamb chops which were very good. The tamale that is served with it is to do die for. My other friend had the salmon. All our meals were very tasty. It was still a fun experience."

I started out with the chopped salad, which was full of flavor and very fresh.

Mole is VERY DIFFICULT to do right, so I was kind of worried about this one.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and the mole sauce was prepared perfectly, and it was used sparingly, so it didn't over power the other flavors on the plate.  \n\nThoroughly impressed!

Now that's saying something for me!   \nIt's a great place to have a fairly reasonably priced mean in Vegas and still be able to talk to your company.  \n\nThe staff checks on you enough to make sure you are happy but not so much that you feel like you have an extra person in your party.

Mesa Grill is close to the food court and close to the Casino, It is one of those restaurants that have been there for a long time and really made it's mark. For some reason thou, I would always pass by Mesa Grill, look at the menu and move along. To be honest, if you just go with what the Menu says it would not wake up your taste buds, the items listed are so simple and sounds..ehhh. \n\nBut time and time again I would always wish I have tried Flay's restaurant when I get back to L.A., especially since I am an avid cooking channel watcher and self claimed foodie. This weekend, me and the wife had a quick getaway and I made it a point to get a table in Mesa Grill, with very high expectations, since I just saw him kick ass in the Kitchen Stadium and throwdowns....I AM GLAD I FINALLY WENT!\n\nLooking at the Menu outside, I decided to start off with  some Tiger Shrimp w/ Roasted Tamale and the wife got Blue Corn Pancake, both tasted wonderful and they really set the mood for the mains. Although browsing the menu, nothing really looked exciting to me, luckily I saw some tenderloins, (the bourbon got me) and I went with it. The wife wanted some fish but all they have that night are scallops and a Cioppino, both were not her likings so she decided on a Filet Mignon, medium rare, and we got some spicy sweet potatos on the side.\n\nLet me tell you that the first bite of the Tenderloin, Mesa Grill had me... the meat was soft, very tender, the spices are there and you can really taste them but does not overpower the meat. It was delightful. The wife's filet is holding it's own on the taste department, the rub and the mushrooms are something to behold.  Somehow the star of that meal is the spicy sweet potato, the way it was prepared is something that I have not seen nor tasted before. the potatoes are cut in a rectanglein thin sheets and piled high instead of mashed. The texture of the potato changed and the spices are unbelievable, something to taste to believe. Bobby did not dissapoint at all with this restaurant and I will continue to cheer on him on TV or up until I come back to one of his restaurant."

The goat cheese queso fundido was recommended by the waiter; it was chunky cheese that was halfway cold by the time it got to our table.  I ordered Bass.  It was so soggy, almost inedible.  AndI couldn't believe that the food at Bobby Flay's restaurant was BLAND?!?!  So odd!  The after-dinner cocktails were super, super strong.  I like to drink, but I don't usually do pulls of Hawkeye Vodka on the rocks, and that's what it tasted like to me!  I would try another restaurant; there are plenty of them on the strip!"

I went here (3/2/08) with my girlfriend and another couple - we got 2 appetizers, a bottle of wine, 4 entrees, 4 after dinner drinks, and 1 dessert and the bill was around $360. Not worth the price -- Todd English's Olives is SSOOOO much better. Save your money and go there for a nice night."

We sat in a corner booth, which allowed for privacy. \n\nThe waitress brought out a breadbasket, which had a variety of bread. We also got two free appetizers, because they sent it to the wrong table. Luck was on our side.\n\nI went with the signature dish for my entree- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I never had pork that tasted so good! It was melt in your mouth tender. I also loved the little bit of kick it had to it and the sauces. The dish also came with sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Both spicy and sweet represented on the plate. I liked the tamale but it wasn't on the same level as the pork. \n\nI left with a full stomach and a great impression of Bobby Flay. In the future, I'll seek out his other restaurants."

Make a reservation its hard to get it (we did).\n\nThe decor was kind of lounge like, not what I would call romantic but not bar and grill like. Just a relaxed upscale lounge, a bit of noise from a large room with a good number of people. We were seated to close to other couples and a large party, its my only real knock on the place, give us a few more inches between tables (its literally about 8 inches).\n\nThe wait staff was great, different waiters for different function. The main waiter knew the menu, was able to make recommendations and assisted us with our selections very well. I would say the service was some of the best I have had. \n\nWe had the usual appetizer and meal, I had the classic Mesa Ribeye and my WIfe had Lamb chops. Bother were cooked expertly and seasoned well. I would honestly say that hers was better than mine, but beef can be boring when sat next to well prepared lamb (according to my taste).\n\nThe appetizer, drinks, and dessert was a reasonable bill for a very nice meal. \n\nI would say overall one of the better meals I have had at a high end place, so often you pay piles of cash for pretense and marketing. At Mesa you get great service, good food, and ample amounts. It is really a bargain."

The service is excellent, the decor is updated and modern, the food never disappoints, and I am always eager to go back.\n\nI always order the Tiger Shrimp Tamale and there is never a bite left over. I sometimes order it as my lunch entree because it's a decent portion that perfectly hits the spot for me. Other delicious things I have tried are the Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon (yum!) and the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was very rich but also very delicious. Everything I've had was top notch which is why I keep going back. \n\nThis restaurant is 5 star quality but not necessarily 5 star budget. Lunch is less expensive, and dinner is understandably more. Entree's run anywhere from $15-$50, depending on when you go and what you get. If you want to do it cheaper, definitely go for lunch. If you want to get fancy, you can easily run a tab over $150 for two people with appetizers, drinks, dessert, etc. Basically what I'm trying to say is that you CAN eat here on a budget, so don't let the menu intimidate you. When we get the salmon and tiger shrimp for lunch, my fiance and I usually slide out at around $50 with tax and tip included, which is basically just as expensive as buying ribs at Applebee's.\n\nThe only critique I would have on this place is that sometimes you sit a little too close to your neighbors. But the food is so good, it's not enough to knock it down a star. \n\n*SIDE NOTE:* You have to remember that eating Bobby Flay's food is like a Food Network experience for your taste buds. You must eat all of the things on your plate TOGETHER. It's all about the different sauces and blending of flavors. Especially when I ate the pork, it was very rich, but when I added it together with the other things on my plate, it totally mellowed out some flavors and added something new! It was like a flavor epiphany."

Which tasted great.\n\nMain dishes only left us with the tigon of a poblano chilli and a mushroom quesadilla. See? Not much variety.\n\nI guess this is a place for meat lovers, but if you're vegetarian, be weary of trying one or two things only. Cuz that's all they have."

Okay so I am expecting regular chorizo, the kind that is ground up mixed with eggs. No way no how, and I never want the ground up kind again! This chorizo was grilled as a whole sausage and it had so much flavor, amazing!\n\nGrits - These were okay, garlicky and tasty, but not as mind-blowing as the other two\n\nThe cactus ice tea came with simple syrup, along with an array of sugars which I loved!\n\nOverall, I had rainbows coming out of my mouth after brunch, and I thought it was reasonable for Vegas prices.

We had reservations already, and I would recommend making them at least that morning to ensure you have a spot. There are also tons of deals in Vegas offering 1/2 price meals at many of the nicer restaurants on the strip. Unfortunately, we didn't get those tickets. Theres a nice bar that offers a huge selection of tequila and margaritas that you can sip or gulp down while you wait.\n\nWe were seated right away, and the tough process of selecting which delicious entrees to eat was tough. We decided on the Crunchy Squash Blossoms as our appetizer and we each took our pick of delicious margaritas. The Blossoms were light and crispy on the outside and warm and creamy on the inside. There was a sweet citrus sauce that balanced everything out with savory and sweet, creamy and crunchy. We also had a small bread basket that had different types of blue corn muffins, raisin bread and jalapeno cornbread, very tasty.\n\nOur entrees continued to impress. The New York Strip steak was a fair size, I had it cooked medium rare. It was juicy with that delicious hint of grilling there, but not overwhelming. There was a house steak sauce that was very good, but I prefer my steaks as they are. I ordered a black bean and rice stuffed chile relleno fried in a corn meal coating. It was pretty good, but probably the weakest of everything that I ate. The roasted corn side was very good, not really creamed corn but it does have a light drizzle of cream and cheese, it had just a little sweet taste from the corn. \n\nThe real show stopper was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. It had a Bourbon Ancho Chile Sauce and was accompanied with a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Absolutely heavenly.\n\nThe service was spot on and our waitress was helpful with suggestions and prompt with service and checking in on us. It was an overall perfect dining experience and I thought it was delicious."

In the celebrity chef throw down, Bobby Flay beat Emeril hands down!  \n\nThe decor was upscale approachable.  You could wear nice jeans and a nice shirt and feel comfortable here.  I only wish it were not right in the casino.  Although the restaurant is beautifully decorated with nice details, if you look  beyond the glass windows, you could see the betting monitors.  Mesa Grill needs a better location...maybe in the Forum near Spago's where the view is much nicer. \n\nMy friend and I started with Blue Corn Lobster Tacos appetizer.   The order gives three mini tacos, but wow!  Those little guys are packed with flavor!!  I could eat 20 of those!  Not for that price though.  Haha.\n\nWe each ordered an entree and splitted them.  My Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon was spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth tender, and so full of depth from the coffee rub.  The mushroom-ancho chili sauce was the perfect rustic accompaniment with its rich, deep flavors.\n\nMy friend's entree of New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was out of this world!  I have never eaten a pork tenderloin like that.  It was still pretty pink, but I trusted that Bobby Flay knew what he was doing and wouldn't give me salmonella.  Well, I'm glad I went for it, because that pork was as tender as the filet mignon.  I seriously could not tell the difference in tenderness between the too.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Chocolate Pretzel Tart.  For me, the best part of that dessert was the spicy peanut butter ice cream that came with it.  The heat was not a smack in the face type of heat, but rather a slow warm heat in the back of your throat.  The tart was a pretzel cylinder with a pool of chocolate sauce.  In the \"moat\" was what tasted like a flourless chocolate cake.  Delicious!  \n\nOverall, what I really liked was Bobby  Flay's command of spices.  If something was described as spicy, it was always a deliberately controlled amount of spiciness that just slowly warmed the back of your throat and lingered.  it was a beautiful orchestration of flavors blending into a perfect symphony.   Truly amazing."

The burger was prepared very well but I felt the bun was too big.  After 10-15 minutes it started to get hard and dry.  Ok, that didnt sound right but it did.  Someone asked for tabasco sauce but they don't have any.  So they waiter brought out a homemade green sauce in replace of the tabasco.  It was fantastic!  I wanted to drink it.  It had the right amount of heat and enhanced my burger.   I felt the food deserved 4 stars but the service is what brought this review down to 3 stars.  The waiter wasn't very friendly.  He was probably hung over or hated his job.  For this type of restaurant with lots of press and hype I would think Bobby Flay would know how important service needs to be.  I will probably go back and try a different dish next time."

When we arrived we were early and so we had to wait until 5 minutes before being seated, no big deal. But having had reservations so far in advance we thought that we would at least get a good table. We were seated in what I would say was a bench like seat on one side with a chair on the opposite side of the table. The table to our left and right were so close that eating in a private setting is completely out of the question. You would think being a high end establishment with a world famous Chef there would be world class accommodations. Guess again. Tried to state our case to the Maitre d but they were not willing to put us at any other table. We were very disappointed in what we thought would be a dinning experience."

I like his style and I really like the fact that he incorporates a lot of different chiles and southwestern flavors into his food.\n\nI came here with my wife Shelly and two of our best friends. So we decided to try several different items.\n\nWe started with the appetizer of the Barbecued Ribs that are finished in a peanut chipotle sauce. Lip smackin' good! Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We next moved to the Blue Corn Pancake with bbq'd Duck and was finished with a habenero star anise sauce. Very good. It was small so we each got one bite but we enjoyed it nonetheless. We also enjoyed the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos. These were fantastic!! The flavors were spot on and this was my favorite appetizer. Last but not least was the Burrata and Grilled Radicchio salad. Not bad but not spectacular either.\n\nFor the entrees we ordered three of them. I ordered the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. Shelly and I split this dish. This was finished with a maple-horseradish glaze and got a \"wow\" reception from the entire table. I love veal and this did not disappoint. I ordered it medium rare and it came cooked to perfection. My buddy Dave ordered the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon that was finished in a mushroom-ancho chile sauce. This also received rave reviews (I had this on my previous visit) and was cooked to perfection as well. Fork tender and flavorful. Our friend Brenda ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Rellano. This was stuffed with roasted eggplant, manchego cheese and then topped with a sweet red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar. This dish was outstanding. This may have been the least enticing dish for me but was very memorable for the outstanding textures and flavors. I tend to go more toward meat dishes when I dine out but I would not hesitate to order this on my next visit. It was that good!\n\nFor the sides we had the Roasted Corn with chipotle aioli, lime and cotija cheese. Awesome!  We also had the mashed potatoes with the green chile queso sauce. This was spectacular as well.\n\nThis was my second visit to Mesa Grill and I was just as wowed as my first. If you like Bobby Flay and his take on southwestern food this place is not to be missed.\n\nAs a side note...what made this a most enjoyable experience was the company that I was with. Great friends and great food cannot be overstated."

This was apparently no problem, as we were seated immediately.  Our waitress was pleasant and explained everything to us fairly promptly after we sat down. \n\nI ordered the pork tenderloin and my sweetheart had the Stuffed pepper.  We were probably expecting to wait a little bit for our food to arrive after ordering, but surprisingly we were served somewhat quickly.  I'd say within about 10 minutes of ordering our food, it was sitting in front of us. \nBoth of our entrees were really well prepared and very tasty. \n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be the ice cubes.  I had expected that maybe for once (in vegas) that when I ordered up a bourbon on the rocks, I'd actually, finally see a real ice cube. Especially in a restaurant where people are supposed to know about these things.  It was pretty disappointing to have three slivers of ice, that had basically melted by the time I was served.  Honestly I'm only really complaining about it since on the dessert and drink menu they list a glass of a nice bourbon for $35.  I feel like if you were to order the higher end stuff as an after dinner drink, you would be pretty disappointed if you ordered it on the rocks.  I know that this is a small detail to most, but I think many people that drink scotch or bourbon would agree.  If you're ordering a drink on the rocks, there is a reason for it.  \n\nOverall the experience was great, and I would definitely stop her again sometime, though I think maybe for lunch, and hit up someplace a bit more high end for dinner."

This was the second time I had been to the restaurant, the first time being about 7 years ago.  I had fond memories of Mesa Grill from the past, but was slightly disappointed this time around.  Since I was not paying, I only ordered an entree, so I ordered the ribeye.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium ( the server suggested this instead of medium rare)  ... it looked like medium rare to me anyway.  Perhaps, she was heading off some potential problem that the cooks might have been having with undercooking meat?  The steak was flavorful, but could have been accompanied with more of the sauces that came along side of it.  My only issue with the steak was that it did not come with accompaniments.  Every other entree selection (besides the filet) came with a side dish or tamale of some sort.  For $48, I expected something.  The waitress suggested that we order a couple of sides to split, so we got the corn and the spinach.  Both portions were TINY and really could not be split unless your idea of splitting them is a tablespoon serving per person.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable although a bit condescending... maybe that is not the best word...  over-confident perhaps?  Anyway, she was ok but kind of icy.  The others at my table had the veal chop and pork tenderloin."

We ordered two burgers - the Mesa Burger for myself, my husband ordered Green Chile Cheese Burger ($16 each).  \n\nThen we waited... and waited... and waited.  The waiter apologized for the delay... and we waited some more.  Finally we asked to speak to the manager.

The manager was very nice, apologized, and told us there would be no charge for the burgers. \n\nThe food was great.  The fries were absolutely perfect - maybe the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is that the burger was so big I could hardly fit it in my mouth.  We enjoyed the food so much that we took a chance on ordering dessert and hoped it wouldn't take as long as our entrees did.  We ordered the Chocolate Pretzel Tart with \nSpicy Peanut Butter-Chocolate Swirl Ice Cream.  It was amazing.  I'm not usually that into spicy food, but somehow the spicy ice cream was the perfect compliment to the tart.  One of the most interesting desserts I've ever had.  \n\nWhen we asked our waiter for the check he told us the meal was on the house - entrees, dessert, drinks, everything - and he hoped we would come back.  We gave him a very nice tip (I don't think the food delay was his fault at all).  To top it off, the manager approached us again on the way out and apologized for the service and he, too, invited us to come back again.\n\nAt the time the wait for the food was really, really frustrating, but we were very satisfied with the manner in which the manager and server handled the situation, and the food is delicious.

The food was dreadful, barely edible. Our first courses were served almost immediately (perhaps one minute) after they were ordered...they must have come off a buffet or steam table rather than being prepared/cooked to order (cooked shrimp, tamales, and a salad). One entree (pork) was served cold (actually chilly), and when re-served was dry, tasteless and very poor. The other entree (salmon) was clearly of poor quality containing a considerable amount of the fishes grey flesh which is found under the skin and is usually trimmed away in the kitchen. The fish was otherwise tasteless, and generally not good. We were terribly disappointed and left as soon as we could!"

Quesadillas, queso and other starters make for a great lunch selection to share.      \n\nTheir mojitos are to die for so make sure to try one on your next visit."

Our group was very impressed by the quality of food {4 appetizers, 11 entrees, 2 sides, 6 deserts, 6 bottles of wine.} Not one person unhappy with their food. Our service was exceptional.\n\nSince there were 11 in our party they considered us a \"group\" and wanted us to order from a limited menu. We picked Mesa Grill based on reputation and so wanted to order from the menu. The Mesa Grill staff worked with us and gave us a great experience. \n\nI personally had a great and well aged fillet mignon with an enjoyable coffee rub. My dining partners were particularly outspoken in favor of the 22 ounce ribeye, and green chili cioppino, and pork tenderloin. A side dish of roasted corn was exceptional. A very enjoyable Willamette Valley Pinot Noir topped off the evening."

            "review": "Overall, I was disappointed by this Iron Chef America restaurant.  \n\nJust so everyone has full information, I do not like Bobby Flay.  On Iron Chef he is so cocky, and I bet you nine times out of ten, his dishes will consist of the secret ingredient plus some blended sauce made of tomatillos and habaneros.  But, I have also watched his throwdown show, and people seem to like his food.  And the guy looks like he can grill up some mean meat.  So I was excited to try his restaurant.         \n\nOn to the review:\n\nMy friend made the reservation for six people and they took her credit card down because if you're late or miss the reservation, they will charge you $50 per person!  Needless to say, we were on time.\n\nBread Basket:  The free bread basket they bring you at the start of the meal was really good.  It is an assortment of muffins, coffee cake, and breads.  I must say that the jalapeno cheddar bread was damn good.     \n\nAppetizers:  The rough cut tuna nachos were good, but small portions.  7 tiny chips to be exact.  I know because after each of us only took one chip, there was only one left on the plate.  The fish was fresh and tasty, but the sauce may have been a little bit too sweet for me.  The bacon and hashbrown quesadilla was nothing special.\n\nEntrees:  I though Bobby Flay, have to get a meat dish, right?  So my friend and I both ordered the pork sandwich.  I wouldn't order it again.  The sandwich was dry and just didn't do anything for me.  Very little pork for such thick bread.  French fries were good with a nice little spice to them.  The steak tartar was good, the best entree in my opinion.  The spicy chicken and sweet potato hash was just weird tasting.  I did not like it all, but maybe that's just my tastes.  The egg and steak dish was bleh....steak, eggs, tortilla, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole, it wasn't baaad per se, just not great.  My other friend ordered the spicy egg dish which I did not try because I don't particularly care for goat cheese, however, the ham that came with it was pretty good, but not spectacular.  \n\nDessert:  We got the chocolate cake, which was good, but I've had way better at other places.  Nothing transcendent here.  \n\nEveryone in my group felt the same way about the food...disappointing.  I wouldn't return back there to eat.  Our waiter was really good, and the decor is nice inside.  (But isn't the decor nice in all Vegas hotel restaurants?)  I would give it 2 1/2 if we could give 1/2s.  My advice:  skip it (at least for brunch)."

The taste of tamale in my mouth sends me straight back to my life in Dallas. Yum-my. Nothing better.\n\nWent in and sat at the bar and was waited on by a fabulous bartender named Christine. She's a mixologist of the highest order. You MUST try her drinks, they are fabulous. But be careful, they're potent too! We had the cactus margarita (can't remember the full name) and the white peach. Definitely try both, they were delicious!\n\nFor an appetizer me and my girlfriend shared the tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale. It's supposed to be Flay's best of. I don't doubt it. It was a flavor explosion that really rocked my mouth! Creamy flavors, sweet tamale, large shrimp. You'll regret not trying this. \n\nFor our lunch I ordered the smoked shrimp tacos and salsas. My gf ordered the ancho chile-honey glazed salmon. My mouth, personally, was on overload with all this flavor. \n\nThe tacos came out with two skewers of three large shrimp, two flour tortillas and three salsas and cabbage slaw that was delicious. The salsas were mango, avocado and one other that I'm not sure of, but trust me, you will eat all three and love them. \n\nThe salmon was HUGE. I couldn't believe the difference in size. Mine was two dollars more and half the size. I was crushed. The salmon was flaky and covered in this creama sauce that was to DIE for. I would definitely recommend this for sure. \n\nFor dessert we finished it off with the sticky toffee pudding. Wow! Sweet and dense with a really great flavor. Was really impressed. We wanted churros, but they don't serve them at lunch, which we found odd considering that churros are a staple of southwestern cuisine. Anyway, we'll go back for those at dinner soon!"

I got a couple different glasses of wine - 1 Mesa Grill Cuvee Cabernet and a Spanish wine.  The bartender was awesome and so helpful.  She let me taste quite a few of the wines.  OH and I also started the dinner with a White Peach Margarita......YUMMY.  The bring out a small bread basket at the beginning of the meal as well which includes a delicious sweet corn bread muffin and jalapeno asiago bread.  \nThe reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I was surprised at the lack of wine by the glass choices and also a little surprised there were no salad entrees (menu is fairly small). They have a lot of different tequillas though and honestly I was glad there were no more menu options as it was hard enough to decide.\nI highly recommend!  Delicious food with great friendly staff."

Tried the Black Widow mojito, and I didn't really love it.  The cola bit was a little strange, but I did like the grenadine in it.  I never got the famed bread basket :(.  Next was the blue corn pancake with the duck.  It was room temp, neither hot nor cold, which was confusing, and the duck was a little overdone.  Otherwise tasty.\n\nNext was the New Mexico pork tenderloin.  It was really nicely cooked at a medium; the rub was tasty, but the spiciness took over my mouth and numbed it to the other tastes that were going on.\n\nDessert was the Autumn fruit tart with buttermilk pastry cream.  The pastry cream tasted only of regular cream and not buttermilk, and the fruit was nice and tender and not too sweet.  \n\nNice spot to people watch, defintely."

            "review": "\u00a1Buen provecho! \n\nSUMMARY: The food here was very tasty. Theirs is a modern, elegant take on Southwestern fare. There was a splash of sweet and a kick of spice in each dish. The meat was tender and the service was excellent. Our server, Joel, was attentive and informative.  He made a lovely meal all the more enjoyable. \n\nEXPECTATION OF THE FAMOUS:  Emily Dickenson lamented, \"How dreary - to be - Somebody!\" I don't know how \"dreary\" fame is nowadays, but there are drawbacks.  Clearly Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill both suffers and benefits from his fame. My advice? Let go of whatever you think of Bobby Flay when you sit down to eat. Don't allow preconceived notions fed by reality television shows to color your expectation.  Many fabulous restaurants on the strip are owned/led by accomplished, talented, and (when we are lucky) creative chefs. At Mesa Grill (MG) the owner/executive chef also happens to be famous.  That fact should be the least important part of your experience with this place.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nTIGER SHRIMP: This delectable bite was my favorite of the night. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and like many dishes at Mesa Grill, comes with corn.  This appetizer was creamy and sweet. It was a gentle start to the meal.\n\nBLUE CORN PANCAKE: Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But the tender meat and complex sauce compensated for the overly sweet bite.\n\nNEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By the time the grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of the sweet dishes. But in fairness the \"sweet + meat\" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, the sweet provides a gentle method for accepting the kick in many of the dishes.  There is a purpose behind the flavor selections. I appreciate the thoughtfulness behind the dishes.  What more could I ask?\n\nCHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light.\n\nPRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected.\n\nVERDICT: This was a lovely meal. The food was well prepared and the overall experience was enjoyable. While I'm not putting Mesa Grill on my rotation, I would certainly visit with a friend from out of town. There is a slight.... artificiality to the place that I can't pin down. It's a slick establishment.  They are looking to leave you feeling something. I may not have been as moved as MG management would have liked, but I appreciate the professionalism and the effort.   There is nothing \"dreary\" about doing something well. And Mesa Grill does high-end, delicious Southwestern food very well."

On the menu it is described as \"coffee rubbed\" and the only thing I can think of that would taste worse than coffee is a filet ruined by being rubbed with it. The chef was accomodating and they made the filet without the coffee rub for me. I assumed they would add some other delicious spices and maybe a sauce to take the place of the \"rub\", but it was very basic and just a tad dry.  Was it good? Yes. Have I had better? Yes. My advice would be to look at the menu in advance and make sure the selections appeal to you, since it's a Tex-Mex/Mexican kind of place. All in all, a decent meal with good service."

After seeing there were 752 reviews on yelp, 4 stars, we had to try it.\n\n2 things I absolutely loved:\n\nPressed Cuban Sandwich - the patty is thick and SO JUICY!!!!! It has to be ordered a little pink, so be ready for that. Bobby Flay's thing is mixing up the spicy with the sweet, and sour. It's a perfect combination. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by southwestern food, but I really was. You also get to dip this delicious Cuban Sandwich into an aoili dip that makes the sandwich even better.\n\nNot to mention, it comes with canjun fries which you don't even need ketchup for. Perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy and soft at the same time.\n\nI also loved the:\nSpicy beef tenderloin tartare  (appetizer). It comes with a little potato salad that you can taste the quality in. The beef tartare has capers in it, and has a lot of flavor in it compared to other ones I've had at other places. It's truly delicious. \n\nWe also ordered:\nRough cut tuna nachos - they were spicy, and it was a good portion to be shared amongst 5 people. It had mango sauce in it, I'm allergic to mango so I'm a little biased on this dish.\n\nSpicy chicken + Potato hash - it's basically an eggs benedict, southwest style. My friend ordered it, and it was good, but it gets sickening after a while because of the hollandaise sauce. I wish they served this with some veggies on the side or something, just to balance it out.\n\nGrilled swordfish sandwich - If you really liek the taste of cooked swordfish, then go for it, I wasn't really impressed with this.\n\nSpiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - served cold, but great flavors and the pork is soft. Surprisingly, it taste a lot better than it looks. However, it sounds a lot better than it tastes. \n\nThanks Mesa Grill, we'll be back on our next trip!"

Upon entering I really appreciated the layout and decor of the restaurant, plenty of bright colors and a lot of people who looked to be having a great time. \n\nThe host was pretty full of himself, we did not have reservations and he made it pretty clear that we should have. But upon looking down at his reservation list we were immediately seated. I understand that the place is popular, but there is no need to be arrogant to customers just because you are working at a high-end eatery.\n\nOur server was definitely a step up from the host, but his voice definitely let us know that it was not OK for my sisters to order appetizers for their entrees. My sisters both ordered quesadillas, my dad and I ordered the pork and rib-eye. Everything tasted great with the exception of the homemade steak sauce on my rib-eye. Perhaps I am the exception, but I don't want what tasted like A1 on a $46 rib-eye, the steak itself was awesome, but the sauce was definitely lacking.\n\n4.5 stars for the great food, margaritas, and atmosphere... dumped to 3 stars for typical Vegas service that I would expect from a bouncer with a group of 10 guys trying to get into Marquee."

They all usually start by saying something to the effect of, \"I don't care for Bobby Fley's TV shows\" or \"I'm not the biggest Fley fan..\" and then is always followed up by the same but: : \"...The meal was amazing\" or \"...You have to try it when your in Vegas\"  And if you are constantly bombarded by hearing statements like these over and over again, it's hard to avoid coming in with your expectations raised.  \n\nFor those looking for the cliff notes version:  It didn't disappoint.\n\nHere is the long version:\n\nFirst things should note is that the service here was simply exemplary, our server (Brian) was attentive and but was able to keep it from feeling stuffy and overbearing, and considering we were in the middle of dinner service and the place was buzzing with energy, for some reason things didn't feel quite that way with him taking care of us.  Talking to him about the dishes, his personal recommendations and even his check ups on us came regularly but he managed to not disrupt the mood of our dinner conversations.  Busers, were circulating constantly and kept refilling my water (I drink alot of it) without the need for me to keep asking and they kept the bread coming.  Oh man, the yellow/blue cornbread with bits of pepper in it with the creamy honey butter was so damn tasty...  They kept that coming too, but it took my g/f and a knife to keep my advances on the bread bowl at bay since we had a ton more food coming...\n \nStarter - Blue corn pancake with Barbecued Duck and a Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce:\n\nSuch a mixture of complex bold flavors, really bold.  The duck was moist, richly seasoned, the sauces hit every single taste bud:  heat, smokiness, the anise provided a very deep level of different flavors, the blue pancake was super thin, light and fluffy and in texture reminded me of a Chinese pancake/roast duck dish I was familiar with, but the similarities ended there, the flavors totally scream to me what Flay is all about.  Superb.\n\nNew Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin in a Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter\n\nMy g/f ordered this dish, so I got to pick at it a bit, from the bites that I got in I have to say the meat was superb, well seasoned, nice char on the outside and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was rich and sweet and was a nice change of pace with the rest of the dish.\n\nChipotle glazed in bone rib eye with a currant chile reduction sauce and a Pumpkin tamale + thyme butter\n\nThe two little rib eye pieces were also perfectly cooked, the sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it with a touch of heat.  The meat had a nice smokiness to it, and there was a nice char to the meat on the outside with a bloody awesome in the middle.  The pumpkin tamale provided a sweetness to the dish, personally I liked the sweet potato tamale more.\n\nA side of a Chile relleno\n\nA stuffed chile deep fried, anything tastes better when it's stuffed and deep fried.\n\nTres Leches Flan\n\nRich creamy texture, the caramel sauce and the light crisp cookie on top was just....  (I'm running out of words and synonyms to describe something as good)...  Each bite was absolutely intoxicating.  Each bite had a little bit of caramelized sauce, creamy vanilla infused flan and cookie crisp.\n\nSo to sum up, fantastic food, great drinks and amazing service.  The evening was perfect and more importantly it lived up to and surpassed my expectations, and considering Vegas is home to a number fantastic restaurant, Mesa grill is definitely a worth-while stop.  I'm pretty sure I will be making a stop off in New York sometime soon and check out Fley's other restaurant.  Because hell, Ill say it, I like Bobby Fley!!!"

Recently Bourdain has said that Bobby deserves more than just that show on Food TV where he gets embarrased by cooking local food against a local and having the audience like *suprise* the local's food better.  But that's Bourdain's opinion.  He hasn't been to Mesa Grill.\n\n For being such a world renowned egotistical chef, you'd think he'd be able to put money where his mouth is.  I gave him a fair chance (3 courses + drinks) but he disappointed me to no end.  The one thing he got right- smokiness. He was able to really capture the smoke in the soup.  Unfortunately he also ODed the soup on Cumin.  Eh, mediocre.  The scallops were filled with Cumin. \n\nWhat does a kid from NY know about Mexican food?  Good question.  Answer? Cumin.  That's it.  One word to describe Bobby Flay's food at Mesa? Cumin.  Well how about 3 words?  GOD AWFUL CUMIN.   I think Bobby went down to Mexico to learn how to cook, they showed him the Cumin spice and that's the end. \n\nWho likes food to all taste the same?  If I wanted that I'd go to McDonalds.

We ordered 5 different desserts, the BEST was a toffee pudding cake, closely followed by the coconut cake.  The churros had a bit too much cinnamon and tasted sort of bitter.  Otherwise, I have to say that everything I tried was EXCELLENT, this was my favorite restaurant I went to in Vegas (this is comparing it to Scarpetta, which is a close second, Table 10 at the Venetian, and Aquaknox at the Venetian)."

They knew their menu inside-out and weren't afraid to say if something was just \"eh.\"\n\nI tried the Tiger Shrimp Tamale which wasn't incredible but I give B-Flay props for his creativity.  And then I had the Coffee Filet Mignon which was excellent.  I feared the coffee flavor would be overbearing and it would taste like a failed Dunkin' Donuts experiment but it was seasoned just enough to know that it was coffee, not a bit more.\n\nThe second time around -- not on my company's dime this time -- I ordered the Mango Tuna Steak.  Now, I feel that this dish is the epitome of B-Flay's amalgamations.  The dish was part mango (which seems to be his vice), cous cous (some far-out non-traditional ingredient), and chile sauce (the token traditional ingredient) on a somewhat off-kilter meat like tuna (because cow is never good enough for Flay).\n\nThe decor was pretty cool.  Somehow, they managed to pull the \"I'm on a plateau but it's fun\" look.  Plus, Mesa Grill logo is pure marketing genius.  My co-workers were pretty sick of my running commentary on the restaurant logo.  \"Dude, Bobby must have his MBA because that logo is so cool.  Does Bobby have his MBA?  Guys?

After a few visits they've polished it up a bit and got their service and food spot on.  It's our favorite restaurant in Vegas (much the same as it's our favorite restaurant in NYC).\n\nThe first couple of times here, when the restaurant was first opened, the service was a bit off, or perhaps we were unlucky and got a newby waiter.  The margaritas seemed to be watered down too.  Thankfully, the good food kept us coming back.  The last couple of visits have been great, and they have their timing and attentiveness dialed-in, and have perfected their margaritas.  They check on you enough without getting in your face every two minutes, and the food is paced well so that you don't have overlapping dishes.\n\nWe love the margaritas here, and like to come a bit early and have one or two before the meal.  I like getting the smoky floaters (aged tequila) on top as well.  \n\nA few notable items from our last visit:\n-Tuna nachos.  This is tuna tartare with avocado and chips (and some kind of caper dressing).  This was and is one of our favorite dishes at either Mesa.  Alas, as of our last visit it's been hit by the recession shrink ray.  We used to get one order to share, but its now too small for that and they don't give you enough chips.  It still tastes great though.\n-Crispy calamari salad.  Basically classed-up fried calamari, but really, really crispy and with a variety of sauces, and called a salad to make you feel better about yourself.  There's a vinagrette, some kind of sundried tomato sauce, and some kind of avocado sauce.  I liked the vinagrette best.\n-Veal chop with wild rice tamale.  I think this dish has the signature Mesa Grill tastes.  It's basically a really good cut of meat that has been perfectly grilled, with a very nice and slightly spicy sauce on it (some kind of pepper/chipotle sauce) and some demiglace.  Very tender and flavorful on its own with a little zing from the sauce, but not overpowered by the sauce.  The tamale is a nice side.\n-Green chile ciopinno.  Fish, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster in an excellent green chile broth.  This one is hard to describe; the flavors are pretty unique.  Just try it yourself, it's excellent.\n-Corn flan with caramel.  I'm not a huge fan of flan, but this is the best flan I've ever had.  Very creamy, and despite being covered in caramel it's not too sweet.\n\nOverall, we love this place and definitely will be back."

Okay, so we get there and are greeted with friendly staff and were seated right away.  Looking over the menu we realize it's not exactly kid-friendly. (our mistake for not checking ahead of time). I also notice it's a bit priciey but we are on a budget so we forgo the appetizers..She and I both order lunch on the lower end of the menu.

So we order the sirloin.  (my daughter does ask how much it was but I guess he didn't hear her and she didn't repeat herself. ) My daughter also wanted one of Bobby Flay's signed cookbooks so we added that to our order.  I get the check and almost fall out of my chair!  The steak for my 10 year old grandson was about $48.00 and no, Bobby Flay didn't cook it himself.  (I would pay extra for that and eat it myself) \n\nOk, so I pay the bill and ditch the book. I was upset that the waiter didn't mention that the steak was as much as it was.  He knew it was for a kid! I took it out on his tip.  I really think he should have said something.  \n\nFood was good, actually, food was fantastic but soooo not happy with waiter."

We have never been disappointed with our meal or service. \n\nOn our last visit our server went out of her way to make our visit an excellent experience. Thank you Laura you rock!\n\nThe food was as good as I remembered it to be. We started by splitting the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and the Sophie Chopped Salad. Both were incredibly delectable. We then moved on to the Green Chile Cioppino, Alaskan King Crab Cake, Smoked Chicken & Black Bean Quesadilla and Blue Corn Pancake. Now mind you all this food was for two. My husband couldn't decide what to eat so he ordered all of it. The only objection I had was that the Crab Cake was way too spicy. Very close to being inedible. But the rest of our meal was epic. Needless to say it was another memorable evening. \n\nThank you Bobby Flay and Staff!!!"

My fiance had the chilequiles while I had the chicken & sweet potato hash (think southwestern eggs Benedict). They were ab-fab, as were the glazed bacon and chorizo we ordered as sides; the bacon, in particular is insanely delicious. \n\nThe restaurant was smaller than expected, but the decor is lovely. Our seats afforded us a view of the open kitchen as well as the casino floor, so we could people watch as well as watch food being prepared. \n\nPlease note, if you are looking for Taco Bell, On the Border, etc. look elsewhere, that isn't the kind of food served here."

One medium/one medium rare, both of which were grilled spot on.\nTwo of us ordered the Chicken Hash, which was another good choice and an interesting combination of flavors.  The grits that were served with it were some of the best I've ever had. Our burgers were served with fries, which while weren't bad, paled in comparison to the duck fat fries we had the night before at StripSteak.\n\nThe extras: They provide a complimentary assorted breads basket, which is well down and was scarfed down by us quickly.  Three of us tried different margaritas, which were excellent. \n\nWhy service was terrible...very slow, we had to wave down servers on more than one occasion (if we were taken care of, why would we ever have to do this?!), one person, who had just ordered a diet Pepsi, was out of drink for a while until we had to flag someone down for a refill. At $4 a soda we expect a refill.  Our server actually started talking once before ever getting to our table (couldn't hear him) and started walking away while I was talking to him. Kinda rude buddy. Especially if you're serving at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nThe total, for the four of us, excluding tip was $122.15"

Modern, clean, with clear Southwestern elements thrown in without it being at all kitschy.\n\nOn to what's important - the food...\n\nBread basket: jalapeno asiago bread, corn bread w/jalape\u00f1o cilantro and tomato (?), and blueberry walnut [3/5]\n*** Cold crumbly/dry bread, hard butter. Was especially excited to try the two jalapeno breads and while you couldn't really taste the cheese nor jalapeno in the Jalapeno Asiago bread, the corn bread was pretty darn good.\n\nBlue corn pancake + barbecued duck w/habanero chile - star anise sauce $15 [3/5]\n*** This was an OK dish. Not too big a fan of the sauce. I think they were trying to work with the concept of a peking duck pancake here but was a little off on the execution. Sounds like it's been on the menu for years so there might be fans out there. I'm just not one of them.\n\nTiger shrimp + roasted garlic corn tamale w/corn - cilantro sauce $16 [4.5/5]\n*** The star of the meal. It's got a lot of rave reviews for good reason. It's on point visually, texture-wise, and most importantly, in flavor. \n\nNew Mexican spices pork tenderloin sandwich w/grilled red onion, arugula ancho chile mayonnaise + southwestern fries $16 [4/5]\n*** The ancho chile mayonnaise was mmmgoot. The pork tenderloin had a tasty rub as well. Great flavors.\n\nOverall a solid meal but I probably wouldn't prioritize Mesa over other Vegas favorites. Now..... where do I go in California/Nevada to eat the kind of stuff he cooks on Iron Chef? Or anywhere really?"

I had made reservations on Open Table prior to coming to town, but was running late because the traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard was pretty bad. After I pulled into the Coliseum Valet (which is free, by the way), I told the attendant that I was running late. He pointed out to me where the restaurant is located (it was my first time) and told me that he would call the restaurant to let them know that I was coming. Much appreciated! \n\nIt was an early dinner reservation, even though I was late, and the restaurant was about half full when we arrived. By the time dinner ended, however, it seemed like the whole restaurant was full. \n\nWe had lamb porterhouse chops served with two sauces (preserved serrano sauce and mint chimichurri) and a blue corn tamale, coffee rubbed filet mignon with roasted corn, black angus new york steak strip with mashed potatoes, and baby romaine salad with roasted garlic dressing and hominy croutons (how unique). Every single entree was cooked perfectly, and each bite was delicious from beginning to end. \n\nThe service at the restaurant was top-notch. We were promptly seated when we arrived (we had reservations), our orders were taken quickly, and our food was delivered to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. Our waitress Brenda was wonderful, and all of our servers were very attentive. As we left the restaurant, we were greeted by at least half a dozen staff members. \n\nThe food was bit pricey, but well worth the culinary experience. My family and I don't come to Vegas often, but I felt that since we were here, we might as well indulge a bit and enjoy ourselves--we certainly did that at Mesa Grill."

Dinner prices are high and not justified for the mediocre food.\n\nWe started with the lobster tacos, the blue corn shell taco shell was probably the best part.  The sauce is a little spicy with nice flavor.  My only problem is that the tacos are very small, and they used shredded lobster meat versus big chunks of lobster.  The lobster lost is flavor, being drowned in the sauce.  \n\nI had the spiced pork tenderloin, its actually decent.  Again, the sauce was really the star.  The pork tenderloin did not have a whole lot of flavor, but it was cooked well.  The sweet potato tamale was really good, probably my favorite part of the entree.\n\nAlso sampled a side of chile relleno and smoked chicken quesadilla.  Both are very bad.  The side chile relleno was stuffed with black bean, making it very heavy and starchy, you lost all flavor from the chile/cheese because the black bean came out too strong.  The smoked chicken quesdilla was similar, it had a lot of black bean, no cheese, and a very thick tortilla.  So both are basically bland and tasteless.\n\nI guess some items are hit and miss, i just ordered the wrong stuff.  For the prices they charge on dinner $$$, not worth it, i would go elsewhere for a more satisfactory meal."

Mr. Flay's west coast version was a dream realized only 5 years ago and being situated in a place like Caesars Palace seems ideal.  After all, being the predominant cuisine is Southwest, what better location (aside from Arizona / New Mexico) than Las Vegas?\n\nWhat is strange to me is that the prices are significantly higher in Las Vegas than the New York location.  A slab of fish of any type could be had for $2-3 less and this includes most of the other appetizers / entrees.  I have no problem paying more for better food, but this does not trump anything that could be had in New York.\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous.  A great mix of vibrant colors surround the dining area, with a contemporary feel with an elegant twist.  The funky shapes accompanied by the eclectic decor, which really pounces on the New American theme, while retaining a Southwest element in the food.  I'd give the nod to Las Vegas over New York for ambiance and the overall interior look, however, I expect this since this location is significantly newer.\n\nService is fantastic.  Our waiters were extremely knowledgeable in the food and were able to make excellent recommendations that were enough to impress our guests.  The menus change often and often times it is completely different than anything offered in New York or the Bahamas.\n\nOn a whole Mesa Grill is a real decent place to catch a great meal for business and pleasure.  Most of my business meetings have been during their lunch hour, which I prefer over dinner.  It's not the best in the Bobby Flay restaurant family, but certainly not the worst."

The blue corn pancake/barbecued duck and rough cut tuna \"nachos\" were fine. Most disappointing was the pork tenderloin sandwich. The complimentary bread basket was very good as well, with the yellow/blue corn muffin and jalape\u00f1o bread being the highlights of the bread basket.\n\nThe tiger shrimp corn tamale was our favorite. There was nothing innovative here, but the shrimp were grilled and seasoned perfectly, and the corn tamale was on the sweeter side which complemented the shrimp. The corn tamale was soft and not firm, like in more authentic tamale. As such, the dish came off more like a shrimp and grits, with the corn husk mostly for show. The corn tamale was on the sweeter side, like sweet cornbread. The cilantro sauce was good, though the cilantro flavor was more of a hint, rather than a definite presence. There wasn't anything innovative with the dish, but everything tasted very good.\n\nThe bread basked, surprisingly, was my second favorite item. It came with a hybrid corn muffin which was half yellow corn and half blue corn. It was sweet and went well with the butter. More impressive was the jalape\u00f1o bread, which reminded me of the jalape\u00f1o cheese bread that you can get at the Schats Bakery on the way up to Mammoth from Los Angeles, however this bread didn't have the cheese. As such, it wasn't as impressive as Schats version, but it was still pretty tasty. The other bread that came with the bread basket was more commonplace. It was a raisin walnut bread which was fine, but nothing spectacular.\n\nThe rough cut tuna \"nachos\" was fairly tasty. In essence, it was like tuna tartare, served with some flour tortilla chips and blue corn tortilla chips. It was served on top of mango-haba\u00f1ero sauce and avocado crema. The mango-haba\u00f1ero sauce (which was surprisingly not spicy) tasted better than the blander avocado crema. Again, the dish was executed well but nothing innovative. Similarly, the blue corn pancake/barbecued duck was fine, tasting like a less flavorful version of Beijing/Peking duck. There wasn't anything really memorable about this dish, but it was not bland.\n\nThe most disappointing dish was the New Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. The best thing of this dish were the fries. The pork tenderloin was soft but otherwise bland. It didn't taste much of any New Mexican spices. In addition, the ancho chile mayonnaise tasted more like plain mayonnaise, missing a lot of the flavors of ancho chile. Given the description, this dish was surprisingly bland, and we would opt to try something else next time.\n\nAll in all, everything was well-executed and was well seasoned, with the exception of the pork tenderloin sandwich. You get a hint of Southwestern flavors, but the flavors are held back to appeal to a broader audience. I wished that some of the flavors were punched up a bit more, but overall, we were pleasantly surprised by our lunch at Mesa Grill."

After walking away defeated like I just climbed Mount Rushmore with no one to greet me at the top I walked outside with my family and reviewed the hours of operation that said \"Mesa grill closes at 11pm\". I then walked back into the restaurant and asked again politely to someone standing by the polite hostess and they finally said OK. \n\nBobby if your reading this.... I love your food that much to walk back in the same Resturant that turned away my family of five away before official closing hours. \n\nThank goodness for the second hostess/ manager who seated us. In addition the food was spectacular and the service was incredible. The server saved the day for me. Just couldn't believe that the hostess was ready to turn away a $450 check."

So we went that day for lunch. But to our disappointment the rib eye was not on the lunch menu.  He talked to the manager and was able to convince her to get the chef to make the rib eye. This is one of the best steaks I have had. It is in my top three. What really sets it apart from the rest is the sauce.  The red & green chile sauce is the perfect complement to the rib eye."

            "review": "Best bread basket ever.  I'm not a bread person at all, and I tend to ignore the rolls that restaurants usually put out with meals, but I would go back to Mesa just for the bread.  There was an herb and asiago and a corn and chile muffin that were just incredible.  The herb and asiago was subtle but not overly so, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and the corn muffin - oh my goodness.  First of all, beautiful - the color of the chiles comes through in a red swirl that makes an appetizing contrast with the dark gold of the muffin.  Texture is spot on - soft and warm and crumbly but not dry, and when you bite into it you find whole kernels of corn tucked inside that really add a little extra.  And of course, it tastes wonderful.  The chiles really give it the perfect kick - I cannot imagine a better corn muffin.  Needless to say, but my friend and I polished off our bread basket in no time and the thoughtful waiter noticed us picking at crumbs and brought us a second.\n\nUh...so I just spent a significant fraction of my life talking about the BREAD at this place.  It was just so impressive, and I had high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Amazingly, they were not disappointed!  After devouring the second bread basket sans mercy, we ordered a ceviche sampler to start.  The sampler was very pretty, with four square plates each holding spoons topped with tiny tiny tiny little mounds of various ceviches.  Each ceviche had a different flavor to it, and they were all quite good, and we managed to share through some surgical utensil usage.  This was probably the least memorable course, if only because there just wasn't enough tasting to get acquainted, but still superb.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the pan-seared halibut and my friend ordered the chile relleno.  I think I had the better entree, but both were fantastic.  The chile was a thing of beauty, huge and crusted in cornmeal, sitting on a little pool of colorful sauces.  I tried a few bites and it was goooood.  My halibut was heavenly.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was incredible!  The flavor was really deep and rich, almost like a zesty barbecue, and it worked magically with the mild fish.  Sweet red onions were also a nice touch.\n\nThis being our last night in Vegas, we weren't about to skip dessert, and we ordered a fresh berry tart with strawberry creme fraiche ice cream and an empanada with peach, mango, and cream cheese filling with a white peach tequila sorbet.  (Seriously, how do you see that described on the menu and not order it?)  Both were exceptional.  The tart was one of the best fruit tarts I've ever had.  It came on a gorgeous puff pastry that was perfect with the fruit and the custard filling.  The strawberry creme fraiche ice cream was light and delicious.  The empanada was like nothing else I've ever eaten, and all those components actually work together like a dream.\n\nAnd yeah, the place is pretty.  I especially appreciate the colorful decor because of how well it reflects the beautiful colors in the food.  Service is also fabulous.  Pricing - it's expensive, but not overly so.  I'd say the value is great.  And it's Vegas!  I would much rather drop $70 on a meal like this than on a few bad blackjack hands.  To wrap up a rather lengthy and worshipful review - I would go back to Mesa faster than you can say corn muffin."

I ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around BSing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.\n\nFor meals, my buddy ordered the Mesa Burger with Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion, and Horseradish Mustard on a House Roll with Southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word \"awesome.\"  I opted for the Thick Cut Ahi Tuna Nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  While it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, I still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna I've yet to consume.  The portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.\n\nWhile this isn't \"5 star\" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar' setting when in Vegas.  In retrospect I wish I'd have ordered dessert, but with dinner reserves at Simon later that evening I didn't want to overindulge.....y'know, after eating the Paris buffet for breakfast."

My friend got the ranch style tostada which was ok but the sauce was surprisingly sweet, almost too sweet. The drinks (mango&carrot juice and the blood mary) were a nice compliment to the meals, I'd probably order both of them again. \n\nThis is a great place that's more on the casual-upscale side compared to other restaurants on the Strip and the food is worth going back for, especially because the service was so quick (we finished a full meal in 1 hour)!

First of all, I made a reservation and we got there early, and we had to wait longer than how early we were.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is south western, it's ok, but there's cardboard on the ramp to our table- what's up with that?! \n\nI don't like spicy food- if I did I'd probably like this place more. None of the main dishes appealed to me, so I ordered the corn tamale (appetizer) and the chile relleno (side dish) when I ordered that, the waiter said, sure if you're not that hungry. So then I got super worried that it was hardly any food and I ate tons of bread, which wasn't that good, in fact the corn bread was strait up nasty. The bread with nuts and raisins is really good though! The corn tamale is like corn bread mashed up and placed in an open corn husk so it looks pretty, but the tamales I buy off the street are better! The sauce on the tamale was pretty bomb though- I put some on my Chile relleno. The chile relleno was interesting. Instead of frying it in egg batter, it's covered in a corn meal and baked. It's stuffed with cheese and beans. It has an ancho chile sauce and sour cream. It's good, but I prefer the traditional version.\n\nMy mom ordered one of the steaks and she said it was the best stake she ever had- so there's that.\n\nWhen dessert time came around- all I remember is that one of the choices was chocolate pudding-  pudding?!

You can't miss the restaurant if you're walking by. \n\nTheir complimentary bread basket was good. I especially enjoyed the corn muffin. I loved how it was baked with half yellow corn and half blue corn. I thought that was pretty cool. However, I wished that the corn muffins and the cranberry wheat bread were served warm like the jalapeno bread. They were served room temperature and after awhile it became very cold. Bread is just so much better when it's hot and warm! \n\nFor an appetizer we shared the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. It was soooo good! This was my favorite dish of our meal. The only thing was that for a $20 appetizer, you would expect more than just 3 pieces of shrimp. \n\nFor entrees my boyfriend got the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and I got the Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak. \n\nMy boyfriend really enjoyed his lamb chops. I thought my dish was just okay. I thought that there was way too much flavor going on. The cous cous that came with the tuna was spiced way too heavily. The tuna was already seasoned with a lot of spice, so there's not really a need to serve it with heavily spiced cous cous. The flavors of the tuna and the accompaniments were too intense and it didn't go well together. \n\nOverall, although my entree wasn't satisfying, I don't regret coming here because I finally got to try one of Bobby Flay's restaurant.

I asked the waiter how I should have the tuna steak prepared and she said medium however it came out way over done for a medium, kind of a gray squishy mess :( And there was absolutely no mango or spice :( Husband liked his rabbit though. We also ordered a side of the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Pomegranates + Toasted Walnuts. My first time eating brussel sprouts and I guess it was the hot item of the night because the couples on both sides of us ordered it.

The goat cheese queso fundido was a great counterpoint: warm, gooey and full of great flavor. Unreal. \n\nI will also say that the bartender KNOWS his cocktails. This place is top shelf, and I will say I've never tasted a better Belvedere Gibson. \n\nThe rib-eye was simply masterful. Among the two best steaks I've ever had (other was at Grill 23 here in B-town) and the birthday dude agreed, as he got the same thing. \n\nAtmosphere is fun, swanky, hip and interesting - loud without being overwhelming, nice tiered layout to the place gives the appearance of a bigger room, and the open kitchen design makes you feel connected to your food experience. \n\nI loved this place, and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas for any reason. Bon!"

We asked for a table for two, \"You'll need to come back at 8:30 pm\" was the response. Why we couldn 't be seated then was mind-boggling considering we were the only ones in line to get a table.\n\nWhen we did return we were seated promptly just to the right of another couple.  I could have put my hand in his back left pocket if I wanted - we were that close.  Not very romantic - \"pack 'em in and churn them out\" was the feeling I got.  \n\nI ordered a 22oz steak for a cool $48. You'd think for that price you'd get a side of some sort - nope, nada - that's an extra $9. The steak was big and looked appetizing and was prepared well with a nice char on the outside. After a few bites it was soon evident that this piece of meat was fattier than the kid in the new Ted movie. Maybe 1/3 of it was edible. My partner ordered the chicken breast - it was better than my meal because of the balsamic glaze, but nothing special.  The best thing we had was the appetizer, cheese fondido.  The sweetness of the chilies combined with the creaminess of the goat cheese was very delightful.\n\nAdd to the so-so food that the restaurant is in the casino  allowing the stench of chain-smoking gamblers to overpower the smoke from the grill in the kitchen and you have a big fat failure - just like my steak. \n\nBobby might want to have a throwdown with himself and reinvent that menu, and the ambiance.  Save yourself the time and money."

I've eaten there several times, including this past week. \n\nReservations were tough to come by due to huge crowds at the CES show that week, but I grabbed a spot at the bar which doesn't require reservations.  I tried the veal chop upon the recommendation of the bar tender.  It was tender, perfectly cooked, and had great flavor.  It came with a goat cheese tamale.  I was a little skeptical of the tamale when I ordered, but it ended up being fantastic and as good of a tamale as I've had anywhere.  \n\nI had a couple of margaritas, which were good but nothing to write home about.  The price point is rather high, but not out of line with comparable establishments in Vegas.\n\nOn past visits I've also had the chipotle glazed rib eye and coffee rubbed filet, both of which were excellent."

The restaurant is very colorful and appealing to the eyes. \n\nThe tables are a good size and offer all sorts of arrangements suitable for small or large groups.\n\nMy wife and I were seated closer to the bar and had a great view of the sports book. Which is what I needed as I had a heavy bet on the Steelers against the Colts.... let's just say that I really enjoyed my meal as the Steelers won lol.\n\nThe food we ordered were delicious and very flavorful. Portions were small as expected on the strip with prices that most people would consider are a bit overpriced but since I had won, didn't bother me.\n\nI was starving and pretty much devoured the jalape\u00f1o bread but also decided on a few appetizers.\n\nWe had the crab cake and shrimp tamale to start coupled with a beer and wine. All choices were absolutely worth it. \n\nWithin minutes my wife's veal chop and my turkey dinner came out. \n\nBoth were perfectly cooked and seasoned. My plate was colorful and tasted as good as it looked. My wife's meal was delicious as well. It was plated perfectly that I had to take a pictures and of course have a taste.  The sides on my plate were so good that I'm literally salivating again just thinking about it. The kale as well as the yam were surprisingly good. I'm not usually a fan of both but I've changed my view now. \n\nOur server was very attentive and always checking in on us. Our drinks were topped off and plates and table were cleared quickly.\n\nConsidering our bill was north of $200 I'd say it was worth it. You can probably find comparable meals off strip for half but to say that I've finally tried this place after all of these years is priceless. \n\nCheers Bobby Flay and crew! \n\nMy wife was satisfied which means I was too!\n\nSee you again when I'm back in Sin City! \n\nCheers!"

I'm wary of the celebrity chef phenomenon:\n\nA celebrity chef starts and conceptualizes a restaurant, only never to return to the kitchen once the wheels have started turning and business picks up. The quality drops off once said chef leaves the kitchen, yet restaurant continues to thrive based on name alone.\n\nThat's what I was afraid of. And I'm glad that my assumptions were proven wrong in this case. Props to the service, it was excellent. One of my favorite things about this place is that although it serves a somewhat pricey menu, it wasn't stuffy at all. It had a lively atmosphere. The margaritas are also excellent here. (Probably contributed to the liveliness, now that I think about it).\n\nWe ordered the goat cheese with blue corn chips.The cheese came out on a cast iron pan and was still sizzling when it arrived on our table. Although we ran out of chips midway through, they happily obliged with a generous refill portion!\n\nThe rib-eye (with salsa rojo y verde) was phenomenal. It was made exactly how I liked it (pink with a warm red center), and had this charred crusty (almost caramelized) outside. One of the best rib-eyes I've ever had at any establishment.\n\nThe only thing I regret about this place is not listening to my girlfriend and coming here sooner!"

It is a welcome sanctuary of fine dining without the explosive price tag or pomp. \n\nThe food is a down South seafood kind of thing, but it is safe seafood for the faint of stomach (no fried fish heads or anything). We started with several appetizers, but I only really remember one: the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Tamale... wipe the drool off your keyboard. What an incredible appetizer... even the name is appetizing. My entree was the Ancho Crusted Sea Scallop, and oh my I am glad I got that. The meal had such a rich flavor and was wonderfully complimented by the Cornmeal Crusted Anaheim Chile Relleno and, believe it or not, the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Walnuts and Pomegranates.  Insanity!\n\nI also really enjoyed the emphasis Mesa puts on their Tequila selection. They have over 30 brands of Tequila in Blanco and Anejo styles to fit your taste, and since Tequila fits my taste it was quite a nice way to try new styles.  \n\nAt least go for tequila and an app or two. At most go all out because this place has great food, wonderful service, and a light tasteful atmosphere."

We went to Mesa Grill on a Sunday for lunch - they had their Brunch Menu available, but we were both craving lunch, so that limited the choices.

No big deal, but still.  I guess it was s good thing because we were forced to become the best of friends by the end of service since we were seated so closely that we all shared a conversation (if we wanted to or not!)  I ordered the spiced chicken salad and he had the burger (yes he is boring when it comes to food).  The waiter brought over a basket of misc bread products, the most of which were fine.  One (blue cornbread) was awful.  Weird.  The people at the next table asked us if ours was weird too.  LOL.  We asked the waiter what was in it, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary from cornbread - so why so icky?  Anyway - our service was fine.  The fod so-so.  My chicken salad was way over seasoned.  He liked the burger (so maybe you should go boring).  I paid more than I thought the food warranted and made new friends inadvertently(whose french toast looked awesome by the way)."

I'm not a huge fan of Cesar's Palace but a few years ago while I was in Vegas I found out my aunt and uncle were in town. Needing a break from partying with my friends I decided to rendezvous with family for a quiet dinner. My aunt asked me to meet them at Mesa. I was immediately impressed with the space and the decor. \n\nSince I wasn't too hungry I ordered a soup. I believe it was the pumpkin soup and it was delicious because I recall telling them I wish I had more room in my tummy for a second serving of the soup. My uncle ordered some fish dish and my aunt ordered the cornmeal encrusted Chile relleno. The chile relleno looked so good I knew I would have to return one day to try it for myself.\n\nFast forward a few years and I'm back with my Bobby Flay fan husband. We ordered some cocktails and shared a delicious salad. I ordered the fire roasted chile relleno stuffed with manchego cheese and he ordered the rib-eye. When his steak arrived I thought they had accidentally brought him a porterhouse. It was huge. Although he had ordered his steak medium, it arrived medium rare and was so fatty he wasn't enjoying it. I felt bad, I knew he wouldn't send it back and would pay the $$ and leave hungry. He wouldn't want to admit he didn't like something at a Bobby Flay restaurant. This is a man who raved about the Bobby Flay steakhouse in Atlantic City for years until he finally got a chance to take me. I guess I wasn't the only person who noticed his situation because our waitress came over and said she sensed he didn't like his meal. She offered to take it back to the kitchen and bring him the filet. I couldn't believe it. She was so astute! Now, that's service! He gobbled up the coffee crusted filet and loved it. We both left very satisfied with our meals. \n\nPrior to this experience I would have said Mesa is just ok and for what it is the prices could be $5-$10 lower, but after the stellar service I realize that the extra cost is worth it to have superior service.\n\nWe were there on a weeknight and there were a lot of groups that looked like they were having work dinners so if you're in town and need a good work dinner spot consider Mesa Grill."

The pork tenderloin is very good and I believe it's their signature dish. I enjoyed it but my husband didn't really care for the sauce it came with so it may not be for everyone. The Veal chop was very good, a little too fatty for me but I am extremely particular about fatty meats, more than most. My husband really enjoyed his rabbit dish during our most recent visit.\nMy in-laws really liked the salmon and lamb they ordered, they weren't raving about their dishes, but they enjoyed and finished them. If you dine here, definitely order the queso fundido, have a margarita, and MOST DEFINITELY get the mashed potatoes. The next time I dine here, I plan on trying the chicken dish, so I will update my review when I do. FYI, the main dishes don't really come with sides, some have a small meatless tamale and I know the lamb comes with collared greens. The actual sides are sold separately. \nBe aware, if you make a reservation you will need a credit card, and if for some reason you miss your reservation, you will be charged $50 for doing so. Be sure to not miss your reservation, or take your chances walking in. This place is on the pricey side, the first time I dined here with my husband we each had 1 drink, shared the queso, I had the pork, he had the veal, and we shared 1 order of mashed potatoes. After tip the bill was $150. When we ate here with the in-laws, our bill including tip was $360. \nEach time we left roughly an 18-20% tip, the waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu's and always have recommendations. Very good service! \nWe will be back, but most likely for a splurge or special occasion."

To finish off, we shared the panna cotta with berries (yum!). \n\nFor dinner I ordered the chile relleno. SO GOOD! The crunchy outside, melty cheesy inside and super awesome sauces combined to a great dish. I didn't want to share! \n\nOverall, I was truly impressed with Mesa Grill and will definitely return every time we go to Vegas!"

The complimentary bread basket was unique w/ a variety of gourmet muffins/breads. My favorite was the jalapeno muffin. We ordered the sweet corn tamales as an appetizer (featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate), the bacon hash quesadilla & the salmon. To this day I am STILL thinking about the bacon hash quesadilla. I can't wait till I go back in September! \n\nOh and PS the service is great!"

Still, the quality of food is great!  Of course it's pricey....not only is it Bobby Flay's name behind it, but it's located in the heart of the casino!  We will definitely be back though!

I'm thinking - Cheesecake Factory mass organization with no intimacy, EVERYTHING you say (or your neighbor says) is like you're at the same table with everyone one else.\n\n2.  Service - no complaints.\n\n3.  Appetizer - SMOKED CHICKEN + BLACK BEAN QUESADILLA * Avocado + Toasted Garlic Creme Fraiche $15. - Fantastic!  Wow.\n\n4.  NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN * Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale - + Crushed Pecan Butter $36.  My meal.  Meat - no flavor.  Tender, but nothing special.  The sauces were ok.  The Tamale was DRY - disappointing.  Not anywhere near worth $36.. but the plate looked good.\n\n5.  GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS * -Blackberry - Cascabel Barbecue Sauce + Collard Greens with Smoked Chiles $44.  My dining companions meal.  Blah.  Had a taste and was glad I ordered my boring pork tenderloin.  Collard Greens were nothing special.\n\n6.  There was a side corn dish.  $10 fantastic.\n\nI wish we had ordered two quesadillas and two orders of corn and called it good.\n\nIt was a Monday night - I was surprised it was so slow there that we walked right in and sat down.  Maybe I know why now.  With a $7 and a $14 bottle of beer... the $140 pre-tip was NOT money well spent.   At those prices... Bobby doesn't get a second chance... I had a steak at a mexican place in the MGM a couple of years ago that blew my socks off... I think I'll go back there tonight."

The food was exceptional, and the service exemplary. \n\nInstead of bread, they bring you a basket of little breads, muffins and pastries. We didn't eat all of them, but got them to give us a doggy bag for late night snacks. \n\nThe Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale was soooooo good I'm still dreaming about the sauces it came with. 5 star dish all the way!\n\nWe also got the Tuna \"Nachos.\" These aren't really nachos - they give you small tortilla potato chips basically you use to scoop up the raw chunks of tuna and the two sauces it comes with - a habanero sauce that wasn't too spicy and an avocado crema.\n\nAlso, we ordered the Shrimp Tacos. They were delicious - I don't know what Bobby Flay puts in those sauces (other than copious amounts of butter) but I can't get enough. The tortillas are unlike any I've had before, but they might just be the most perfect tortillas ever - soft and strong so that they don't fall apart. \n\nWill be back for the Mesa Burger next time I'm in Vegas."

Every time I go to Vegas I make sure to eat at least one dinner at the Mesa Grill.  My go-to dish is the coffee rubbed filet mignon.  As usual, it was perfectly prepared and was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The seasoning was also perfectly applied.  I have his cook book and can approximate the seasoning, but it isnt as good as the real thing.  I had the roasted corn as a side dish for the first time and I could have eaten it as a meal in itself.  It was delicious.  Working my way backwards, I had the blue corn pancake as an appetizer.

This restaurant has been open for a really long time and I'm surprised that it's so busy. I don't know if this is normal for Mesa Grill or if it was because of restaurant week. Who knows?\n\nMaybe it was because of the food. Everything we had was delicious, each with its own memorable thing.\n\nAppetizers:\n-Roasted corn soup- tasty. I enjoyed the hint of avocado and salsa in the center of the bowl. It complimented the soup.\n-Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - the hit at the table. It came highly recommended and one of the signature dishes on the menu. The thin blue corn crepe wrapped slices of AMAZING BBQ duck. And the sauce had a very nice spice to it.\n\nEntrees:\n-Lobster Out of the Shell - yummy yummy especially since I didn't have to fight with it getting it out of the shell. The butter sauce was delish (who doesn't love butter?) and the crispy hominy cakes were a nice contrast in texture.\n-Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - mmm. cooked to perfection. Nice flavors and the sauce \n-Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin - the meat was nice and tender and the rub on the outside of the pork gave it a really nice spice.\n-Pan Seared Halibut - it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes.\n\nSide dish:\nDouble baked potato- had a light horseradish flavor, and overall a good baked potato.\n\nDessert:\n-Pineapple Buttermilk Upside down cake - disappointing. The caramelized rum sauce was very strong and I didn't enjoy it. However, the accompanying pineapple vanilla ice cream was very light and refreshing.\n-Creme brulee - a nice large portion topped with fresh berries. A good standard creme brulee.\n-Churros- i had high expectations for these since I had just seen Samantha Brown dipping churros in chocolate in Spain. haha. They weren't bad."

My husband and I have a 5 year old girl, very well behaved, and we called ahead to make sure they accommodate kids.  They do, but they have a very limited kids' menu:  cheeseburger, monterey jack quesadilla, or grill chicken with mashed potatoes.  None of which is on an actual menu we were given (the lack of menu disappointed my daughter quite a bit as she likes to look to make her selection).  We were just told about it by our waiter.  My husband and I ordered the goat cheese fundido starter (delicious), and our waiter even thought to leave the peppers on the side in case our daughter wanted to try some as it could make it too spicy.  She did try it, and loved it.  She also tried the sourdough bread, which has hidden pieces of jalape\u00f1o in it, which burned her mouth.  She recovered quickly but was not going near the bread again (there was also cornbread and a sweeter bread with raisins).  A heads up about the jalape\u00f1os from the waiter would have been nice though.  My daughter ordered the kid's quesadilla, and I appreciated how conscious the staff was of her safety when it arrived.  We were warned that the plate was hot, so they set it in front of me instead.  Then they actually asked if I wanted them to take it back to be put on a cooler plate.  Very thoughtful, but I told them we could just transfer slices to a bread plate.  Worked well, and my daughter enjoyed her quesadilla very well.  My husband had the 16 spice chicken, which he loved, but I didn't care for, as each bite overwhelmed my pallet at the end with cinnamon.  The mashed potatoes it came with were the best I ever had though.  I had the veal chop with sweet potato tamale.  Both were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My daughter ate about a third of my veal chop (apparently, they should put that on the kids menu, go figure....)  We also tried the cauliflower gratin side dish, which was good, I guess, but the southwest flavors seemed a bit overwhelming on cauliflower.  We all shared the passion fruit cheese cake for dessert.  It was the lightest and creamiest cheesecake I've ever had.  In all, the service was excellent.  The food was all very good, though admittedly some not to my taste (my fault for ordering it, not theirs for making it, as none of the food was made poorly).  And while this is very much not a family restaurant that caters to kids, the staff did very well in accommodating my daughter and making she sure she enjoyed her meal as much as we did."

Many of the other \"famous chef\" restaurants in town suffer from quality let-downs.  Bobby Flay's Mesa is the one exception to this.   I have been to this place five times now in the past 5 years and it always wows me.  My two favorite appetizers are the tiger shrimp and corn tamale (a wonderful combination), and the blue corn pancake with BBQ duck.  For entrees, you can't go wrong with the spice rubbed pork tenderloin - very tasty and tender, with a bit of zing.  The fresh fish is also good.  On my last trip we had the grilled dorado - which was tender and flavorful.  For sides, you have to try the grilled brussels sprouts with toasted pecans - even if you don't like brussels sprouts, you'll like these."

We had the Green Pea and Green Chili Soup, which was really good, but everything else was not remarkable.  We had the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla, but that was no big deal.  My wife's quesadilla is way better.  I had the Spicy Tuna and Salmon Tartares.  Without the sauce that was drizzled on the plate, there wasn't much taste to them.  It came with plantains, which was cool and the sauce wasn't bad.  \n\nFor entrees, my wife asked if the Ancho Chili-Honey Glazed Salmon was spicy.  The waiter said no and that the soup was spicier.  He had it backwards.  She said it was good, but wouldn't tell people to go here just to get it.  I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin at the suggestion of the waiter.  Again, without the sauce, there wasn't really any taste.  The pork was tender though.  The BBQ sauce it came with reminded me of Everett and Jones in Oakland, but I like their sauce better.  \n\nService was great though.  They were very attentive and did everything we asked.  One flaw is that when we called in, we weren't sure if there were going to be 2 or 4 of us.  We told the reservationist, which probably worked for the casino, and he said, just make it for 4, and call back and adjust it to 2 if things changed.  When we called back to let them know, they told us that we would have to move our reservations to an hour earlier or later since we changed the reservation.  Huh?  I know that it isn't great for the restaurant, but we thought we were doing them a favor.  Never had that problem before.  We should have showed up and played dumb when the other couple didn't show up.  \n\nAnyway, wish our experience was better."

Oh, Mesa Grill, remember that reservation for 2? Yeah, can you change it for a party of 14? 'K, thanks! But seriously, I love large groups at dinner, it just makes everything so much more enjoyable. We were broken up into two groups (6 and 8), and were across the restaurant from each other, which was okay because we changed our reservations, and they were as accommodating as they could be.\n\nWe ordered a variety of appetizers, and hands down, the best one was the tiger shrimp in garlic cream sauce. The entire table could not stop talking about how great it was. Not to say the other appetizers weren't also tasty, it just that I can't remember what they were because the shrimp was so good.\n\nOnto the entre\u00e9. I don't really care for red meat, and you can never go wrong with chicken, but I figured since I was in Vegas, I should try something new. I ordered the Yucatan grouper with Blue Crab succotash sauce. Deliciousness! The best part was, as each person dish came out, we were all drooling, and literally starting passing our plates around so everyone could have a sample of everyone else's dish. \n\nWe were full, but found a way to make some room for this very tasty molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. When we met up with our other table of friends after our dinner, they all looked at me and thanked me for making reservations because their experience was just as satisfying as ours.\n\nAll in all, Mesa Grill was the BEST meal I ever had in my life, from start to finish. Bobby Flay has now ruined me for all other restaurants, celebrity or otherwise. Thank you very much for living up to, and exceeding all of my expectations."

People love their shows, their recipes and even their TV personality, so the excellence of their restaurant and food are normally blown way out of proportion. However, with Mesa Grill, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong in thinking the food was going to be simply mediocre and left more than satisfied with the 1000+ calories I had just happily consumed.\n\nWhen I sat down I immediately told the server that I was gluten-free. Without flinching, he told me that most of the food is gluten-free, but if not, they can substitute the sides, etc, so I won't become ill. This was most relieving since 1/2 the restaurants I have gone to in Vegas don't know what gluten-free means, so this was a great start to the meal.\n\nAfter watching the show \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Vegas,\" I had to come and try the tiger shrimp tamale. I asked the server if it was gluten-free and he said absolutely. My fiance told him to definitely get a start on that tamale with a massive smile on his face and the server obliged. However, before he left he told us about the specials and showed how real restaurants should be training their staff. Very professional. Very friendly. Very fantastic.\n\nOh the Tiger Shrimp. I could bathe in the sauce. I envisioned myself swimming in it last night. I could put it on everything and even though my heart would scream each day, it would be worth the Lipitor. Great flavors, fresh, succulent shrimp and just a small amount of heat. If you are not a fan of garlic, stay away, because unlike the heat, there was a plentiful amount of garlic to keep any creepy Twilight vampire away for years.\n\nI cannot say very much about the chile relleno my fiance ate because 1. It was not gluten-free, but most importantly, 2. It was gone in ten minutes. The ONLY reason it took him that long to eat the chile was because we had just eaten a massive corn tamale and split a bottle of wine. Also, once in a while we try to act like we're classy and not inhale our food. All I know is that seeing the cheese slowly pouring out of the chile when he broke the shell reminded me why I love cheese and why it is so dang good.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken. When you place the words, spicy, chicken and hollandaise sauce all in the same sentence I will pounce on whatever it is IMMEDIATELY. The fact that I was in a breakfast mood was only boosted by the perfectly poached egg on top. Texture city and oh the flavors! Even though I wish it was actually spicy (please note that I am Korean and burn my tastebuds off every other day with chili paste), it was really perfect. First, I picked off a couple pieces of the chicken and then just broke into that poached egg and let it smother the spicy chicken in its happiness. Then I would roll a forkful around in the green hollandaise and all cravings, protein, brunch and fatty goodness were satisfied in one quick bite. It took me a long time to eat it because I was still full from the tamale, but you can't take a poached egg as a leftover while walking around in 100 degree weather. I was forced to eat it all. For shame.\n\nYou should go here. Great service, the food is creative, colorful and absolutely solid. You will be full, satisfied and leave from this restaurant content and rubbing your belly in sheer delight as you muffin top your way back to your room and pass out from a pleasant food coma."

What I am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than Bobby Flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at Mesa Grill.  If you look at the guides, Mesa Grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  A burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  Fries are seasoned really well too.  \n\nThe barbecued lamb salad was delicious and not gamey.  They know how to make a pretty good Bloody Mary - but not as good as Old Ebbitt Grill in DC - Bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what I mean! \n\nService is always great.  Thanks for another delicious meal."

We started with an order of the prettiest cactus pear margarita. It wasn't only pretty, but pretty damn tasty. We then ordered the sixteen spice chicken and bone-in ribeye with sides of cilantro pesto mashed potatoes and creamy roasted corn. The chicken was absolutely delicious. But the ribeye was amazing! I'm not a fan of sauces on my steaks, but the spices on the sauces amplified and heightened the steak's impact. I've been to many great steakhouses and this experience was, by far, our most delicious. We will definitely return for round 2 next time we're in Vegas and we hope for an equally amazing experience."

Here is the basic overview:\nService was not great, and in some moments outright poor.\nAmbiance was nice, but extremely loud and crowded.\nPrices were out of this world.\nFood and drinks were good.\n\nWe walked in on a busy Thursday night looking for a table for three-- I did not think to make a reservation, which I now know I should have.  Our wait was to be 45 mins unless we could find something at the bar. No problem, we only had to wait about 5 mins to get a banquet.  However, once we were seated,  we did not see our server/cocktail waitress for at least 10 mins.  She finally dropped menus and didn't return again for a while.  This was odd to me because it didn't seem like she would have been responsible for a lot of tables unless she was assigned a section outside of the bar as well, which seems like a poor decision because my party felt neglected-- compounding that with the number of loud men drinking around us it made for a rather uncomfortable environment.  A party member approached the bartender ( who happened to have a number of empty stools in front of him) to inquire about our server and purchasing a drink, but unfortunately he was quite rude and dismissive-- he did not offer to serve her a cocktail and told her \"go sit down the server will get there when she can.\"  Hardly the type of response I would expect from a place where I would be paying $40 an entree.  Wow.\n\nWhen our server came over she took our orders with no questions, and was helpful in that she knew the vouchers we were using-- she was clearly familiar with the promotion, which was nice.  \n\nDespite the bartender's rudeness, he poured a very good martini.  The food too was lovely.  The side asparagus and corn were fresh and flavorful!  I also loved the ahi in the ahi tartare and the chicken from the skewers was excellently flavored!!  I don't regret the food, but overall the experience was not what I would have hoped for especially for the money.  I might return to the New York location with a reservation... But I'm not sure that I would be so thrilled about dropping a minimum of $50 a person for food that ultimately wasn't very filling (we split 5 apps and sides and ended up needing to get something else an hour later).  Perhaps it would be different at a table? Definitely plan ahead for this dining experience."

The second time we went, we strategically chose to come during lunch time and there was no wait at all. SUCCESS!!!\n\nPROS:\n- Shrimp and corn tamale - best freaking tamale ever. You HAVE to order this.\n- Complimentary bread basket -  southwest corn muffin, jalapeno and cheese bread, and cranberry and walnut bread. Everything was delicious.\n- Ambiance and decor - that wood panel ceiling is incredible.\n- Service: attentive, kept our water and bread basket refilled. \n\nCONS:\n- They make you take your hat off! It felt a little intrusive, but I guess Mesa Grill is a nice enough place, where they can request such things. \n- Depending on what you order, the food can be SO HEAVY, my cousin and I were in a food coma for HOURS, and we only shared an appetizer and entree. \n- Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - more an appetizer to be shared than an entree on its own. I got tired of it towards the very end of sharing, so I couldn't imagine having it all for myself."

I remembered loving their spiced chicken sweet potato hash. I decided to order it again and honestly it was better than I remembered! Every component was beautifully assembled and perfectly made.    I way overate the meals prior (and of course there was the famed bread basket) yet I polished my plate clean! I did however wish my entree was a little warmer. \n\nTiger shrimp tamale - tbh i was a bit disappointed and thought this dish was just okay. The sauce was really salty and the tamale reminded me of the remnant of their corn muffins. Definitely not worth the $19. I probably would be happier if I had ordered a second spiced chicken hash. \n\nA side of grits - their grits deserve a paragraph of its own. Not sure what they add into it but the texture + the spice + the flavor were so spot on. I didn't think I had the stomach for it but it happily managed. \n\nService - major kudos to our two servers who handled our awkward seating situation so professionally. Side story - the table near us had two young kids who threw up/soiled themselves some time during their meal. Not sure how, what, and when but the servers were able to accommodate us with a new table further away without embarrassing either parties. New plates, utensils, drinks, even bread basket were all brought over to the new table. Couldn't have asked for better service. \n\nOverall - definitely stop in for their famed brunch service!

For appetizer,  I ordered a blue corn pancake, which was BBQ duck inside a crepe, drizzled with habinero sauce and something sweet.  It wasn't spicy like I anticipated but instead very sweet.  It was also paired with arugula, which was so delicious.  Another thing to mention, the bread that Mesa Grill gave before the meal was very unique.  There were 3 different kinds, one being a cheesy one, another one was a cornbread.  \n\nMy entree was the pork tenderloin that was mentioned in Zagat, so I had to try it.  I really enjoyed it; the pork was very tender, and had a good flavor to it.  I remember finishing almost all of it, which was pretty difficult. It also came with a sweet potato tamale, which I also liked just because it was so different.  Super tasty, but after a point you can only take so much starch!\n\nFor dessert, I had the mixed berry creme brulee.

I remember my dad had just finished sipping his Coke, and right as he placed the empty cup on the table, our waiter was behind him handing him another Coke!  Also upon entering the restaurant, there were about 5-6 waiters just on \"stand-by\" waiting on the stairs, which stood out to me.\n\nThe only reason why I wouldn't give 5 stars is because I'd probably not go back.  Wasn't my type of restaurant, I'm not too big on Southwestern food.  More of a personal thing than a Bobby Flay issue."

The idea of a \"fine dining\" experience featuring \"Southwestern cuisine\" seemed like an oxymoron. I could not fathom how this particular genre of food would be successfully executed at an elevated level, because quality Tex-Mex ingredients are not expensive, rare, or difficult to prepare. I've been to local mom and pop restaurants in New Mexico and Texas that served fantastic and memorable chili relleno's, taco's, salsas with roasted chili's, creamy black beans, spiky queso fresco (sp?), and fresh blue corn tortilla's made by hand. Putting an ancho chili spice rub on a pork loin just doesn't seem to justify the price tag. \n\nA friend of mine dined at Mesa Grill, and so enjoyed his experience he requested a visit on our upcoming Vegas trip. I trusted his palate considering he is a product of culinary school, but I should've considered his admiration for chef Flay might sway his better judgement. \n\nMesa Grill is right around the corner from Pure nightclub, (which I suggest attending, you'll have a great time). The decor is quite loud, but I must say A+ for the grill design on the ceiling. Clever. \n\nThe staff. Our waitress seemed flighty. She might have been new, so I'll excuse her erratic behavior. First, she forgot our bottled water, then proceeded to argue with us that we did not request bottled. I don't mind if you forget our water preference, but to argue with us is ridiculous. Then she forgets to inform us of the specials. We overheard the specials from the waiter serving the table next to us. When she came back with our water, we informed her that we wanted hear the specials. Again, she argues with us and tells us she already told us. \"So all four of us are lying?\" I asked. She then told us to \"hold on\" as she double checked the specials. Interesting, considering she claims she had already informed us. Nonetheless, one of our friends ordered the special seared scallop dish with a chili orange glaze. \n\nThe drinks. My friend ordered a mango mojito that was nice and refreshing. I ordered a kir royale. They used Chambord instead of cassis, which I didn't love, because I tasted the liquor as opposed to the sweet, tangy cassis. \n\nThe food. We opted to start with the spiced duck taco's, queso fresco dip with blue corn tortilla chips, and deep fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese, and basil. The duck taco's were savory, but reminded me of a Peking duck dish served at one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. Unoriginal. Tortillas stuffed with duck, a plum flavored sauce, cilantro, green onions, and shredded cabbage. The queso dip wasn't horrible. It was a cheese dip with chips. Not really interesting. The squash blossoms were crunchy, but the ricotta and basil were a little too assertive for my taste. I lost the flavor of the blossoms in the goop of the ricotta.  The basil was a little too sharp. \n\nAside from our one friend, we all ordered the coffee spiced filet, with a corn tamale, and horseradish potato gratin. The filet was cooked perfectly, and the coffee spiced rub wasn't bad. Although, I like to taste my meat. I am a violent carnivore, and I love ripping into a juicy, bloody, fatty, piece of meat. I know, its an illness. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have ordered the spiced rubbed meat, but I needed to decide for myself if spiced meat was a delicious option. Unfortunately, not so. The spices in the rub didn't compliment the meat, as much as it overpowered it. The spices failed to dissipate, so I cleared my palate after every bite. The horeradish potatoes were good, and the corn tamale was nice and moist, but like every other corn tamale I've had at any generic Mexican restaurant. For dessert we ordered an exotic sorbetto Napoleon: Guava, passionfruit, and mango sorbetto, with a carmel crisp. Yummy. \n\nI walked away from my experience feeling ripped off. I wasn't impressed. As a professional digester I never look at prices. It's insulting to the food. Sadly, I wanted my money back. I felt cheated. I want to walk away from a meal feeling satiated, not calculating the costs. \n\nSide note: My uncle wanted to celebrate his birthday at Mesa Grill, and to our surprise, and luck, Chef Flay was in the kitchen. He came out to greet the patrons, and was very nice. He patiently chatted with my 89 year-old grandma, as she professed her love for him, and was kind enough to take a picture with her. He asked if the food was to our liking, then sent over a signed cookbook. I may not agree with his culinary vision, but I respect him for what he has achieved, and his compassion for his patrons."

The serving size was HUGE for me, especially knowing I was going out later...big meals kinda make me wanna zzzzzzzz... anyways. Yum. The place is really good. The only negative, and this just my personal preference, was that it was very noisy. So if you are looking for a quiet, romantic spot for dinner? This isn't it. But go with an appetite when you do!"

There were some hits and misses but overall this is a place that me and the fiance would like to frequent more often. I have yet to try their burger but the fiance likes it very much. I tried their famous blue corn pancake barbequed duck, It was quite a long time ago so I dont remember the flavors distinctly but I was not impressed (obviously if I can't even remember how it tasted) It was forgetable at best. I do remmeber the Bacon Hash Brown quesidilla being scrumptious however and we ravaged the dish. Recently I had the sweet potato Hash, it was a mix of spicy and sweet mixed in one. It wasn't the type of spicy I particularly like ( it was more of a Kick type of spicy). I give it four stars despite the misses because the taste is innovative and unique to the palette so its quite enjoyable."

The best things I ate that night were the corn bread (free), sweet potato tamale and roasted corn (sides). Everything else was kind of an upset.\n\nWe had high hopes for the blue corn pancake appetizer, but the lackluster barbequed duck was masked by the overpowering habanero-star anise sauce. For entrees I had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which despite being huge and tender, was nothing memorable. DH had the Yucatan style grouper, which was light but bland. Where was the Southwestern bam?\n\nThere are hundreds of other nice restaurants on the strip at which we can throw our money. Next time we're taking our business to Mastro's Ocean Club. At least then we could have the novel experience of eating in a tree house.\n\nLT"

His restaurant is located in Caesar's and, if you sit near a wall, you can watch all the sports games and stats while you eat. Or you could just stick your face into your food, which is actually a wise choice.\n\nWe tried three appetizers: the shrimp and grouper ceviche, the queso fundito, and the fried green tomato and blue crab salad. All three were really good, but my favorite was the tomato blue crab. It was limey and cilantro-y and glorious. The queso was amazing, too, but how hard is it to melt cheese? \n\nI had the salmon for my entree. It's true that all the food is floating in pools of sauce with more, different sauce dribbled on top of them from a squeeze bottle, but the sauces are TASTY. The salmon came in a puddle of black bean sauce with a really really spicy, flavorful ancho chile sauce drizzled over it. The salmon was honey-glazed, flakey and fres. My only complaint is that a wild Alaskan would have improved upon the already fantastic dish.\n\nHowever, my friend had the 16-spice chicken, which, incidentally, was on Iron Chef that very week, and I reccomend that EVERYONE get it. I didn't want to order the same thing as one of my dining companions, but I wish that I had. The chicken was AMAZING. The spice rub was a little sweet for my taste, but the chicken itself was cooked to perfection. I've never had such well-cooked chicken before. It was juicy, plump, no dryness at all, even in the white meat.  \n\nAs for side dishes, the corn is yummy, but the cilanro pesto mashed potatoes takes the cake. I couldn't stop eating them.\n\nSo that's what I reecomend: the 16-spice chicken and the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes. Get it and eat carefully and deliberatly. Then pretend you're an Iron Chef judge. It'll be fun, I promise."

The next bottle, I questioned them  about this (I'm not a wine snob / foodie snob, but my wife went to J&W so I've learned to recognize right from wrong over the years).  I also travel extensively for sales throughout the US and internationally.  I've had more than my fair share of steaks. The next bottle he opens at the table and pours the taste into a white wine glass - strike two. There was plenty of sediment in the wine, so I ask him to decant it. Again, before I can say anything, he rushes off to the kitchen to decant and brings it back. Strike three.  Low quality service attributed to POOR management.

My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. The first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with the Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got the steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. The portion was huge and the eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with the grits that accompanied it. My gf got the chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split the scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of the spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off the prix fixe meal and got the Tuna \"tacos\" to start and the crabcakes as her entree. The tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. The crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got the gala apple salad that was overflowing with maytag blue cheese and was sooooo good! Two of our friends got the white peach margaritas, which were really tasty and perfectly strong. My gf got a bloody Maria and our other friend got a bloody Mary; they both had to send the first round back because the horseradish was so overwhelming that you couldn't even enjoy the drink. Once they were remade the girls liked them, but said they were nothing to write home about and that they had both had much more interesting bloody Mary's/Maria's at other restaurants. Oh well, I was perfectly satisfied with my 5 cups of Illy coffee and amazing food. Oh yeah and you start off with a huge basket of different breads, including coffee cake, scones, yellow and blue corn bread, and jalapeno biscuits as well, which are all pretty tasty. If I could give this place a 4.5 I probably would rather than the 5, because of the boring crabcakes and the bloody Maria, but I think it's better than a 4, so I'll leave it at the 5. To be fair, any place I'd be willing to drive 4.5 hours for probably deserves a 5 anyway."

The decor of the place is vibrant and feels youthful. There was no prix fixe menu at the moment, bummer. The bread basket was nice and tasty (I think they had 3 variety of breads). Heck I even asked for 2nd batch and took it home.\n\n1. For appetizers, I ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido w/ Rajas and Ha had the Tiger Shrimp Tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce. Both appetizers were great. I love goat cheese, so using that kind of cheese for a queso fundido was great, but the rajas really added nice flavor. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale was incredible. The masa was nice and light, and the shrimp were seasoned nicely. You need to soak up as much of the sauce as possible. I know its fatty, but who counts calories these days?\n\n2. For Entrees, I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin w/ Sweet Potato Tamale and she ordered The Fire Roasted Veal Chop w/ Wild Rice Tamale. Again, both dishes were superb. My Pork tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium and the sauces that accompanied the dish were delicious, but spicy (which is good for me). That Sweet Potato Tamale aided with the bold flavors. The Veal Chop was velvety, spicy, and absolutely great. \n\n3. Sorry, we were too full and did not order desert.\n\nOverall the total was around $120, but hey its Vegas and you expect to spend that amount for a nice dinner! Worth every penny.

The food is good to great, the margaritas are excellent.\n\nFirst the drinks, they really know margaritas. I don't think their \"Mesa Margarita\" is good but not great. It's a good start that runs slightly sweet without being the typical \"punch-style\" margarita. With the Especial Margarita, you call the tequila and pick one of three orange liqueurs. If you've got a favorite tequila in mind you want this.  Finally, they have the Partida. It's served straight up in a martini glass. But you can get it in a bucket if you prefer. Because there's no ice, it's going to look small. Don't slam this drink. Enjoy it!  Some people think it's too sour, I think it's an amazing drink. \n\nOn our first visit a few years ago, lunch was average. The food was good but the various odd plate shapes actually made eating a bit awkward, maybe we were just tired after the flight. Recently, four of us had dinner and it was probably one of the best service experiences any of us has  ever had in a restaurant. At the start, the wine sommelier switched gears into a beer and tequila expert without missing a beat. I'm pretty sure this isn't his job, but he stepped up and took our entire drink order. We were being pretty picky about what we wanted (me about the margaritas and another guy about beer and tequila combinations), he accommodated everything, offered great alternatives when they didn't stock what we asked for and never made us feel like we were too demanding (we probably were). Our whole party clicked with the waitress. She played along well with our \"we're going to be here a while, drink and eat a bunch, we might be a pain in the ass, and we'll tip well for it\" vibe. Seriously the best service I can remember in a restaurant. For food, two of us has the chile relleno (it's really stuffed eggplant), my wife thought her chicken was good, but my pork tenderloin was the winner at the table. I'll order that again and again.\n\nAbout the poor service...\nOn a different night, we went for appetizers after 10pm. Our waitress seemed uninterested and annoyed from the time she walked up. During our stay, we saw her engaging with other tables for long periods of time, but she never checked on us. Maybe we did something early to set her off, maybe four appetizers plus drinks didn't impress her. The busboy made up for it though, we nominated him as our server and just decided to ask him for everything we wanted, tipping him in cash when we left. We did leave a small tip for the waitress, the food was fine, nothing went wrong, but it was pretty clear she didn't want to deal with us."

            "review": "I came here after hearing so much about the Ancho Chile flavoring that Bobby Flay uses in many dishes.  We had made a reservation for a party of 3, and were seated promptly once all of us arrived.  It was on a Friday night, during a big convention week, so I was pretty impressed by that.  The decor was very modern and cool.  The food was equally impressive.  The presentation of the food was beautiful as well.  I'm sold on this place!\n\nThe one really cool touch I thought they had were the use of agua-fresca jugs in various color patterns on the wall.  First I thought they looked really familiar, and then when I realized that they are the jugs where yummy Horchata comes from, I had laughed out loud to myself.  Onto the food...\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the following:\n\nblue corn pancake barbecued duck + habanero chile-star anise sauce - $15:  I remember this tasting more like really tender pork than duck, and I even had to confirm this with the server.  Strangely, this was not a bad thing.  I was very intrigued by this dish.  We all really enjoyed the slight peking-duck-like flavoring on the sauce.\n\ntiger shrimp + roasted garlic corn tamale corn-cilantro sauce- $16: These shrimps tasted like shrimps. :)  With a more intense flavor than I can remember any shrimp that I've had.  The corn was very tasty as well.\n\nFor my entree, I wanted to try the pork tenderloin that everyone's raved about so much here, and all 3 of us ended up doing the same:\n\nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin bourbon-ancho chile sauce\nsweet potato tamale + crushed pecan butter - $36: This dish was amazing.  It had a strong spicy kick, but not overwhelming and lighting my tongue on fire.  The meat itself was tender and delicious.  AND, there was more food on the plate than I could finish.  Since it was sooo good, I had to pretty much force down the rest, just so that I can continue to enjoy the flavoring and tenderness.  \n\nI am a fan of Bobby Flay.  I'll have to try his other menu items and locations for sure!"

            "review": "I went to Vegas last weekend with my little sister for her 21st. She had never been to a fine dining restaurant, so we decided to go to Mesa. We weren't starving, so we skipped the prix fixe menu and just ordered one entree each. \n\nMy sister ordered the salmon. I saw the disappointment on her face when her plate was placed in front of her. The plate consisted of a very small piece of salmon without accompaniments. I expected a micro green salad or puree since it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, but it was just a lone piece of salmon. The salmon was good, but not worth the price.\n\nMy entree was a different story. I ordered the chile relleno and I give it four stars. The chile was large; filled with cheese and eggplant; and covered in a nice, crunchy corn batter. It was pretty satisfying.\n\nI recommend going to Mesa only if you plan on ordering the prix fixe menu, because it wont be such a let down if one of your dishes doesn't shine like it should.\n\nI still feel bad that my sister's first fine dining experience was such a let down. Chef Flay should put more thought into ALL of the items on his menu. I felt like the salmon was hastily created and was not worth the money that my sister paid."

No lack of creativity here.\n\nTiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale:\nThis one's a no-brainer. Best part of the meal. A \"Best Things I've Ever Ate\" feature on the Food Network.\n\nSpicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash (w/ poached egg):\nI got this because it looked interesting, but not exactly sure how the flavors would compliment each other. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't \"love\". The egg didn't do a lot for me on this dish. If the combination above sounds like it will go great to you, then you'll probably love this dish. \n\nBlue Corn Tortilla + Barbecued Duck:\nAgain, it sounded so interesting I had to get it. I'm glad I did, but I didn't fall in love like the Tiger Shrimp Tamale. If it sounds good to you, it will probably be worth it."

I love Bobby Flay and am addicted to his shows on the Food Network so I guess my expectations were a bit higher??? Really Bobby...Really?!

Better than my dish.\n\nI ordered the coffee rubbed filet mignon (sounds exciting right?!) Wrong again. I thought the robust flavor of coffee with a filet would be an interested and unique flavor combination. NOPE. Just put a bunch of stale coffee grinds on top of a filet and there you go. The filet was basically raw as well-not the way i ordered it. \n\nThe service...OY. Horrible! she didn't even check on us after she took our order. Didn't even care that i didn't eat my raw piece of meat. I'm really not that harsh but I've been in the service industry for years so I really wasn't pleased.\n\nTo my dismay the place was packed with a line out the door into the casino.

I was first of all pleased to find that the pricing was actually quite reasonable, lunch for three with tax and tips was about $150 including a super deluxe marguerita. The food was all excellent. I ordered Chile Rellenos, wife had Sweet Potato Hash, which was really good and son had the Mesa Burger (of course). All excellent, well seasoned, well presented. Decor and atmosphere were all very nice, service excellent. The only slightly negative part of the experience was the waiter. He was a bit too opinionated. I do not mind recommendations, but he seemed a bit put out when we did not order what he thought we should. Small thing maybe, but it somehow bothered me. Still thoroughly enjoyed it, will go back."

We laughed when we were sat because 5:15 was the latest we could get a table reservation until 10:00 and for a while we were the only ones. I didn't have a drink- one friend had the house margarita and didn't say anything about it, and another had a bloody mary which she raved about during and after the meal. The bread basket was excellent- good variety and all very tasty. \n\nFor main courses I was the only one who didn't have a 5 star meal. Husband had the chicken which was great, and came with very creamy chive mashed potatoes. One friend got the special which was short ribs which he liked a lot, and his fiance got the lamb chops. This seriously was enough meat for 4 people. A very good amount of food. \n\nI got the duck and it was probably three stars. My first few bites were quite gamey, but after that died down I realized that the spice crust on the outside of the duck was VERY cumin heavy. I don't like cumin, and  as the description of the dish is \"southwestern spiced duck\" I really didn't think it would be full of cumin. No one else's spice-rubbed, southwestern dishes had cumin at all. Very odd.  Also, the tamale which was supposed to have both goat cheese, which I love, and thyme butter, tasted like neither and was a bit dry. However, the flavor problem I had is not the restaurants fault except for description, so I can't really fault them for that. Also everyone else's food was so good that I just picked something not good for me.\n\nThe service was very good- I drink at least 1-2 liters of water at a meal and they kept up! When we left at 6:15 I couldn't believe what we saw: crowded restaurant, crowded waiting area, people eating at the lounge-area with plates on their laps. It was very crazy! Make sure to get a reservation early, order anything but the duck and you'll be fine!"

We had planned to go last year for our anniversary but had to cancel as my wife was found out she had to have surgery and wasn't supposed to eat red meat in the meantime. Now that she's all better, we decided to give it a try this year.\n\nI ordered a Mesa margarita, and my wife ordered a prickly pear margarita. Both were very good. I liked the taste of mine a little better, but the prickly pear was prettier. It had a pretty magenta color.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our appetizer, we were given a bread basket with three types of bread: corn bread muffin, jalapeno bread, and a nut bread. They were all very good. The corn bread was half regular corn and half blue corn which gave it an appealing appearance. My favorite was the jalapeno bread. It had a nice consistent flavoring of jalapeno without being overwhelming.\n\nFor appetizer we split the tiger shrimp tamale. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. It was like a deconstructed tamale. The shrimp was laid on top of the cornmeal. The sauce was very flavorful, and the dish was well-balanced.\n\nFor our entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the veal chop. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and tender. The sauce wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped for, but it was still delicious.\n\nThe veal chop was also perfectly cooked and tender. The seasoning was spot on.\n\nBoth entrees were served with a cornmeal tamale thingy that was presented like a baked potato. It was very good and was an interesting presentation. \n\nFor our side, we split the Brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds and pecans. It was an interesting mix of flavors and colors. I never would have thought of combining Brussels sprouts and pomegranate seeds, but it definitely worked.\n\nWe took half of our meals to go and were too stuffed to order dessert, though there were definitely some appealing selections on the dessert menu. Maybe next time.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our entree my wife asked if there was a celebrity behind her. I thought that was an odd question and asked her why she asked. We were sitting near the kitchen and she said all of the kitchen workers were looking at someone behind her. I glanced over and saw Tyra Banks sitting a few tables over. Apparently she was at Caesar's for Celine Dion's rehearsal show as we later saw her in line to get into the show.\n\nThe service was a little slow, and even though we got there before the evening rush, we had a lengthy wait between our appetizer and our main course. Because of this, I'd give Mesa 4.5 stars. As we can't pick half stars, I'm gonna round-up and pick 5 stars."

We were there during restaurant week, and they had a $30 tasting menu that was out-of-this-world. The service was great too, the waitress explained everything about the dishes and made some wonderful recommendations. I ended up trying the shrimp tamale to start, the ancho chile glazed salmon as my main dish, and they had the chef's choice dessert as blueberry profiteroles with fresh whipped cream. SO good. I think the tamale was my favorite. The portions were HUGE too, definitely not what I expected (I figured they'd be small due to the price not being TOO high and the tasting menu moniker). Those at our table who didn't get the tasting menu also enjoyed their meals. Oh yeah, and if you go DEFINITELY get a margarita. I don't even normally like margaritas all that much, but theirs are awesome. I had their signature marg, the Partida Margarita, uses partida tequila (100% blue agave tequila), organic agave and fresh squeezed lime juice. This drink is totally worth the $16 price point. If I'm going to drink, it needs to be GOOD. This was awesome. In short, go to Mesa, enjoy a meal and definitely have a margarita. I tried a few sips of other varieties of the margs and they were all great too (though mine was the best!) Highly recommended! Wish there was one in San Diego :)"

The sweet potato was diced and mixed in with diced chicken.  I barely had any chicken in the mix of my dish.  Flavor wise the whole dish was average.  It seemed like everyone was getting the steak and eggs, so you should probably go for that if you ever try this place.

The Restaurant seating is an open spaced floor plan and has  a nice warm Southwestern feel. We came here during Restaurant Week so  I was hesitant on how long the wait would be. To my surprise we got seated right away! Instantly I was pleased as I am not a very patient person when it comes to waiting for a seat. \n\nMy first dish I tried was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with a Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter. All I can say is Heaven. It was amazing. I am always nervous to try pork dishes as it is my favorite type of meat and I hold it to a very high standard. This was the best pork dish I have ever had. Tender, juicy and the mix of spices took me on a wild tasty ride! \n\nThe next dish I tried was the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale with Corn in a Cilantro Sauce. Oh my goodness. I was blown away! The mix of the sweet corn, butter and cilantro sauce was paired so nicely with the shrimp that I ate the whole thing! I couldn't put the fork down it was just too delicious.  The shrimp was huge and the portion of this dish was perfect! I would have never paired shrimp with corn before but am looking forward to finding a way to make this recipe at home.\n\nAnother dish I recommend is the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalape\u00f1o Crema. I was hesitant to order something with black bean sauce as I have never heard of anything like that before. I am glad I took the jump and tried something new! I was totally impressed with the flavors from the jalape\u00f1o crema, the salmon and the black bean sauce.\n\nI had such a great experience my first time at Mesa Grill that I have been back numerous times since. When you visit Las Vegas make sure to make Mesa Grill a priority on your \"to do\" list. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!\n\nSee my full review here: http://corkedandporked.com/2015/03/23/bobby-flays-las-vegas-restaurant-mesa-grill/"

You get the feeling here that it's all about the hot and sweet on every single dish.  Entree was the spice rubbed pork tenderloin with yeah, sweet, sweet, sweet everything.  Bourbon in the sauce, sweet potato, pecan butter (sweet) and ancho chilis.  \n\nThe meal just got monotonous.  Nothing wrong with it but only the lobster tacos were impressive.  Oh and the margaritas were more sweet than sour too."

I guess I'll give it another star because it's not fair to base the rating on my poor choice of food. Only thing.. very expensive. But I knew that going in, so also not complaining. The tamales were super delicious though. the shrimp one."

            "review": "I think it was because the fight was going on and a very odd woman was laying down and going a bit nutty that made me give this place 4 stars. Mesa Grill is located near the Pure and the Sports book in Caesars Palace. The Pacquiao vs Margarito fight was that night, so getting to Mesa was a little difficult. We had a 7:45 reservation and if you miss your reservation you are charged a 50 dollar per person cancellation fee. I did not want to take that risk. We checked in for our reservations and were asked to wait near the bar. Dan and I ordered some semi custom margaritas. The margaritas were awesome.. I mean tasty and strong. I opted to get the basic margarita and add a shot of grand mariner to give it a little citrus kick. Dan went with the Margarita with Patron. We got our drinks and before we took our first sip, our table was ready. Our server was friendly but he looked a little preoccupied. Like I said earlier.. there was this woman dining alone who was acting peculiar. The EMT was called, but she was nutty not sick. She kept on moving back and forth between seats and laying down, this made a uncomfortable dinner. I think this took away from the Mesa experience because the server and staff were focused on this lady. Also since it is near the sports book, you can hear every cheer, jeer, and swear coming from the sports book. \n\nThe reason we made our reservation is because we love Bobby Flay and his chefs did not disappoint. We started ROUGH CUT TUNA \"NACHOS\" and it was tasty. the Mango - Habanero Hot Sauce and Avocado Crema complemented the tuna. It was a sweet and tangy starter. For dinner, I went with the NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and I swear I saw food god that day. It was prepared to perfection and the Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce was so sweet yet spicy. I wasn't a fan of the tamale but the meat made up for it. Dan got a steak and I cannot comment on it because I was loving my pork. I think I only gave him a small bite because I didn't want to share and I cannot remember the flavors. We did order another round of margaritas and did not get any dessert because we needed to get to Mirage to see Jo Koy. At the end of our dinner, our server did give us plastic cups to take with us so that was a nice extra that we would have forgotten. I feel if it was a different day I would be giving this place 5 starts but the service and the proximity of the sports book made me take it down to 4."

Southwest flavors, that's what Flay is known for.  Reminiscent of an over the top Chevy's tomalito.\n\nSpicy Tuna Tartare\nNot spicy.  Fresh, but not anything special.  \n\nEntrees:\nPork Tenderloin\nVery tender, lean meat, moist and came paired with a wonderful twice baked tomato!\n\nSalmon\nGood, could have been better.  \n\nSeabass\nNo one was a fan of this entree.

So we ordered two appetizers (the shrimp with garlic tamale and the rough cut tuna nacho), an entree (chile relleno), and a dessert (the banana creme pie).  These along with the bread basket was more than enough food for the three of us.  \nI can't tell you which was was my favorite, b/c really they were all good.  The garlic corn tamale hit just the right notes of sweet and savory and paired really well with the shrimp.  Def a must order.  I think I like the tuna more though, b/c generally I like my seafood raw.  My husband loved the chile relleno, and said that it was the best he's ever had.  He's eaten a ton of this stuff, so that's saying a lot.  The dessert was a good finisher...it was more like a deconstructed banana cream pie.  i thought that the candied hazelnut at the bottom really added to the dish.  \nI will be returning for brunch, since this is what Flay is really known for.

Maybe it is because I am used to dining in far-less quality, digs, however the service was exceptional. Three of us ladies out for the night. After some advice from our neighboring diners, we started with the Queso Fundido (or something like that) and I could not stop eating it. It was so delicious and it was the perfect thing to start with. I ordered the Corn-Meal Chile Relleno and my friends had the Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla and the Ancho-Chile Salmon (delicious, but a few bones :( As good as the main entrees were, and they were GREAT, the side dishes were the main attraction. The Roasted Corn with Chile and Cotija cheese was literally the reason why I will come back. The Chorizo Tamale was to die for as well. Since we were on a girls night, we also ordered the Pinot Noir which from the advice of our server, was a perfect accompaniment to our meal. \n\nOverall, this restaurant lives up to its name, and I will not only return every time I am back in Vegas, but I have recommended it to so many.  Keep up the exceptional work."

We had made reservations for 8:30pm on a Saturday night before our late night shenanigans at Light. \n\nAs soon as we enter, greeted by the hostess, taken to our table. We then met our waiter, James (he reminds me of an Asian version of the actor Terrence Howard). James was super sweet, charming, he told us the story of the Resturant.... It's owned by Bobby Flay, they are known for their margaritas, lobster tacos, shrimp tamales, lamb and pork entrees. I told him that my friend Viet Pham beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef! He just smiled and recommended we start with a round of the house margaritas. Those drinks were definitely on point! Not too sweet, tart & strong- loveee! They provide a yummy assortment of bread in a basket, the best was the jalape\u00f1o cornbread muffin, the girls devoured them! James came by to check on us and was so kind to bring us more. I'm in love with the service James provided, he was knowledgable, gave great suggestions, was very direct and efficient - he knew how to handle a table of women! We all ordered the lobster tacos, shrimp tamales and had a side of grilled corn & twice baked potato. Everything was light, flavorful and delicious. We ordered another round of drinks! By this time we were craving something sweet! James recommended the banana pudding - my pick! The birthday girl didn't fancy banana pudding so she picked coconut cake to share with the table. James saw my sad face :( and he brought me a banana pudding anyways on him! Loveee him!! Lol. At the end of our meal, he brought out our check and 4 to-go cups to take our margaritas with us - to keep our party going. I love his thoughtfulness and his service is by far the BEST I have ever seen. \n\nThank you James for your amazing service! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm dining at Mesa Grill for sure. See our pic!"

But seriously, it met every one of my expectations and more.\n\nMy best friend and I ordered the shrimp tamale, the blue corn crusted halibut, and a peach margarita to share.\n\nFirst, the peach margarita. Super strong. With just half the drink (admittedly on an empty stomach), I was buzzin pretty hard.\n\nThe tamales. Oh god the tamales. We had been dreaming about this dish for so long, and it surpassed all of my expectations. The sauce was so amazing delicious. Rich, but not overtly so, and perfectly seasoned. The shrimp was succulent and the tamale itself was delicious, not too dry and a bit sweet, with little pieces of corn studded through out. The sauce was what really pulled this appetizer together though.\n\nThe blue corn crusted halibut paled in comparison to the tamale, but it was delicious in its own right. While not the best thing I've ever had, the blue corn crust was unique. The halibut itself was flaky and wonderfully moist. The tomato based sauce was really yummy, and went surprisingly well with the fish.\n\nLastly, the bread basket. Mesa Grill has the best bread basket I've ever had. The jalape\u00f1o and cheddar bread was my favorite, with the sweet dessert bar coming in at a close second.\n\nService was good, if a bit pushy with the drinks, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the next time I go to Mesa Grill, I'm getting 2 shrimp tamales as my entree. :)"

Being an avid watcher of Food Network, I've longed to try this place because of Bobby Flay. As soon as we went in the restaurant, I was told to take off my hat, which was fine but weird considering that was the only dresscode. That being said, they were serving their brunch menu. Our server was very kind and attentive and asked if we had any questions. I decided to eat light and order the Corn Tamale with Garlic Grilled Shrimp while my father ordered the Mesa burger. In the meanwhile, we were served a bread basket consisting of jalapeno biscuits, some sort of banana fruit crumble, and savory cornbread. You could really see a lot of southwest influence here. The food came out, and for the shrimp tamale, the shrimp was very flavorful and the sauce and corn tamale balanced perfectly with it. I also had half of my father's burger which I have to say the medium rare patty and the simplicity of the burger itself made it one of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were just cajun spiced fries. For the desert, I settled for a carrot cake ice cream sandwich with roasted pineapple. The ice cream was cream cheese flavor, and you could really taste the cream cheese presence along with vanilla flavoring. Only complaint with this desert is that the carrot cookie is a bit too hard to bite into. The roasted pineapples were also a great compliment! All in all, for lunch, Bobby Flay is a good man. Vegas food is usually a hefty price to pay, but the prices are fair and the food is worthwhile, so definitely give it a try!"

I couldn't resist ordering the ribeye again medium rare, and it's terrific as ever.  Very nice crust on the outside, juicy meat on the inside.  And the sauce pairs so well with it.  My wife ordered the salmon this time, very moist and juicy, she loved it too.  For appetizer we ordered the shrimp tamale and duck pancake.  But was done very well and very tasty.  Mesa Grill food are always on the strong side, but you never feel food being too overpowering and I could definitely have more.  \n\nHowever, food aside, I have to say we were not as impressed about their staff services this time around.  On our first visit it was fabulous.  This time our server was very nice but not top notch by my book.  \n\nThe staff at the front though really left us some bad taste.  First of all, when we made reservation, my wife clearly said 7 people, 4 adults and 3 kids.  When we arrived and checked, they said no only 6 people.  Fine, things happen and I consider that innocent mistake.  But the staff didn't show any \"concern\" or \"eagerness\" to help fix the problem.\n\nEnding up my wife stood there for a few seconds and asked \"so is this going to be OK?\"  The male and female staff stood there, looked at each other, talked a bit, and said \"yeah it's fine\".  My wife then said \"OK, thanks.  We will be waiting outside because of the kids\".  Both staff did NOT even acknowledged her, not even looked at her once. \n\nSeriously?  To me it's very basic customer service to at least acknowledge your customers.  I don't even we were even asking for the unreasonable.  Mesa is not the most expensive restaurant out there but still on the high side, so I personally expect better services overall."

            "review": "When I arrived in Vegas from Oakland,  I tried to go to the Mesa Grill restaurant but never made it about 6 times.  I won a few thousand dollars from table games on a single night.  It made me feel good.  I deliberately decided where I wanted to eat out there for a supper that evening.  Oh, I forgot about the Mesa Grill.  Let me go there without having a hard decision to pick one of the most excellent restaurants in Vegas.  There are so many restaurants inside the Ceasers casino.  I walked all the way to the exact restaurant that I looked for.  It looked a whole woody decor inside the restaurant but it wasnt like a Southwest cultural influence. It's more like a woody cabin.  A Hispanic hostess greeted me to a table where I could sit down.  I looked up in a wine menu and looked for a glass of chardonnay from Napa. It wasn't available but was available for a bottle of chardonnay.  They have offered only white French wines for a glass.  I won't order a glass of French white wine.  I decided to skip it.\n\n I ordered: Tiger Shrimps with corn tamale -- well-done shrimps, along with tamale(crushed corn flours), and sweet corn sauce with red pepper sauce(mild-hot). \nAnd Cilantro Spice Chickens-- well-done chickens along mashed potatoes and cilantro sauce (sweet smoking spice flavor).  They are so delightful.  The breads included some pieces of jalape\u00f1o.  \n\nI'll go back there again for different kinds of meat and seafood.  Any cost on a dinner menu is expensive.  This restaurant is nothing comparable to other Mexican or Southwest restaurants because a variety of the Southwest flavors is the top-secret recipes."

My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of Bobby Flay, and tries to emulate his own cooking after Flay's style.  I don't cook and I am a very picky eater, but what an amazing and fun experience Mesa Grill was!  I don't eat meat but I love seafood so I was happy to see spicy tuna & salmon tartares on the appetizer menu.  Every ingredient enhanced the fish, and the combination of various spices and herbs was a symphony of flavor!  Loved the appetizer!  Being the salad person that I am, I ordered the grilled asparagus salad...grilled asparagus, pecans, wild roasted mushrooms and mixed greens, and I asked for no blue cheese crumbles though that is also part of the dish.  It was gorgeous, both in plating appearance and taste.  Rob excitedly ordered the coffee-rubbed filet mignon and I think we took multiple pictures of his dish before he cut into it.  I didn't taste it, but he swears up and down that it was the \"best meal I've ever eaten\".  The service was spot on and the wine sommelier even came to our table to help us pick out a spectacular cuvee that went with our meal.  We're already planning our next trip to Vegas...or maybe NYC or the Bahamas where the other Mesa Grill venues are located.  :)"

The tamale is very moist and fluffy with a good amount of sweet corn kernels for texture and the prawns were perfectly cooked in a creamy, but not heavy, sauce. \n\nThe hash was quite delicious, but eating half of the dish was sufficient as the bbq spicy sauce + sweet potatoes is a bit too sweet and overwhelming for a brunch dish. Salad was a good balance to the hash with fresh lettuce and good dressing.\n\n5 stars for that tamale that haunts my dreams."

Plus, I need to wean myself off going to Bouchon EVERY trip. Creature of habit, but I wasn't giving the other places their fair try.\n\nOn this Saturday, we were able to make a reservation that day for dinner at 9:00PM. When we arrived it was pandemonium at the front desk. People were coming in in droves for their reservations. You know - it's the usual Vegas name-restaurant-at-big-hotel crowd - older tourists mixed with throngs of youngsters dressed-to-kill-and-get-laid in an anonymous place. The young people hang out in gangs - gangs of 6-8 girls, gangs of boys. Gaggles? Gangs? Anyway, it's fun to people watch but these large groups of giggling 21-year olds in nearly identical mall outfits and 5-inch heels can get tiresome. At least they keep Vegas pumping.\n\nEven though we had the reservation, many folks were seated ahead of us. We asked the vacant-eyed girls at the front desk when we would be seated and they vaguely answered that they were doing their best.\n\nFinally I had to go up and grill one of the gals and told her we were feeling neglected and unhappy. She finally busted a smile and let us know that Bobby was in the house and people weren't leaving their tables and they were waiting for a \"four-top\" and yada-yada. Moments later our four-top opened up and we were seated.\n\nEverything changed after that. I ordered a cocktail to relax. Bread came - bread I normally don't touch. A basket of warm, aromatic bread. Oh, jeez, okay I'll eat some bread. Anyway, I had a 4-hour hike that afternoon and I deserved some carbs. Holy cow, people. It was the best bread I've ever had - the sourdough baguette with flecks of jalapeno pepper - sublime. I don't even LIKE sourdough bread. I liked this bread. Very much. I was relaxed and happy now. The service staff was attentive.\n\nWe ordered queso dip and quail appetizers. The delicate little quail were served on a schmear of red pepper sauce. Divine. I sucked on the bones. In public. The goat cheese queso dip was delicious. I shared the apple salad - too big.\n\nI had the venison - the most perfectly-cooked venison I've ever had. Rare but not pulpy slices sitting on a piquant reduction sauce. Outrageously good. Husband had the lamb posole and our friend had the coffee-rubbed filet mignon. All good. Everyone happy.\n\nWe would definitely return to try more of the menu. \n\nMy only complaint was the host/hostesses - they need more training on how to handle crowds and keep people happy. More personable people need to be hired."

The bottle of wine my boyfriend and I shared was moderately priced and delicious.  The goat cheese fundido was large and yummy, and was a nice change from the usual \"queso\" you can get at TexMex restaurants.  And the halibut we shared was large and spicy with really great, complex flavors.  The chopped salad was meh- small with typical ingredients and flavors.  I wouldn't get this here, get something more exotic.  The ceviche trio looked amazing, fyi.  Overall, the meal was a great success and I would go back in a heartbeat.\n\nThe odd thing were the tables around us, which prevented us from getting really good service.  The table to our right waited thirty minutes for their appetizer to be delivered, were angry, and were comped on the dish.  The table to our left were hicks (seriously) and were demanding, loud and obnoxious.  The worst part is that they were convinced they had *JIZZ* on their beer glass and were making a big scene about it.  The manager tried to explain to them that the lime on the side of the glass was dripping down and created the liquid on the glass, to which the wife said, \"no thats not lime, I'm a mother\" (wtf?) and the husband yelled, \"if you think it's lime, then lick it!\"  They were given a new beer, and the husband once again complained there was jizz on the glass.  And yes, I mean jizz.  So retarded.  I thought our server (who was their server as well) handled the situation very calmly and rationally, but it was very distracting (and funny, I'll admit, I was laughing my a** off listening to them).\n\nWith all the drama, we saw our waiter very rarely, hence the one star reduction (along with the unmemorable chopped salad).  However, in any other circumstance I'm sure he would have been better.  And the busboys made up for our server, as they refilled my flipping camel of a boyfriend's glass at least twelve times.  \n\nThat couple to our left though... man, I thought LA had all the crazy people."

I've looked over the menu before and thought it was a pretty normal menu but it was spectacular!\n\nFor appetizers, we had the corn soup and chicken skewers. Let me tell you the portions may look itsy bitsy but it's more than enough to start your meal with. The soup was tangy with a hint of heat and it was so unbelievably smooth. And the chicken skewers. WOW! The plate comes with three skewers, a gloried BBQ sauce and some pieces of lettuces, mint and parsley. I had no idea what to do with the lettuce until our server pointed out that I would make little wraps with it. Boy am I glad she caught that. It was delicious. The chicken is nice and charred on the outside but still wonderfully moist and juicy on the inside.\n\nFor the main course, my boyfriend got the black angus stead and I got the salmon. I'm not much of a beef person, but my boyfriend knows his steak. In his opinion, the steak was more than worth the $50. The chef got the temperature just right and underneath the steak was the BBQ sauce with a blend of other really colorful sauces. And we were both surprised at the portion of the steak. It was almost double what you normally get. The salmon also had the same bed of sauces, a little repetitive but it was delicious no less. I got it cooked medium because that's how our server recommended it (it was pink in the center) but I'm sure you can request it to be cooked through more. The salmon was great! Nice and moist and the outside had a really nice sear on top.\n\nFor dessert, we had the toffee bread pudding and the chocolate bread pudding. When my boyfriend ordered a glass of wine, our server noticed it was his birthday a few days prior and brought out his dessert with a little candle in it! I thought that was nice! :D Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with my dessert, hence one star less. They had a pretty comprehensive dessert menu too, in case you're much of a sweets person you can order a 15 year old Bourbon instead!\n\nNow, the service was speedy and so friendly! So so friendly! Sat us down with a smile and sent us away with a smile, so that made the night even better.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a trendy and casual place to eat, this is your spot. No need to decipher fancy french menus here!"

However I will admit the corn flavored sauce that accompanied the tacos was amazing.  The salmon was very good but not equal in comparison to the price charged.

            "review": "I've been to Mesa Grill in Caesars palace several times for dinner and I admit I'm clearly infatuated with Bobby Flay's style of cooking even if he is an ass.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the dress casual, and the place has been hopping every time I've been.  I definitely recommend making reservations a couple days in advance if you want to eat at a reasonable time, but if you don't, there is a bar in the waiting area where you can have a few tasty Mesa Grill margaritas.\n\nThe service was very good the times I've been and I think I found the best waitress I've ever had here.  Not only was she very responsive and knowledgeable with the menu, she told us what was \"just alright\" and was genuinely friendly.  I'm talking about someone who will sit down next to you and engage you a bit, instead of just feigning interest and listlessly read through the specials.\n\nIn short, the food here is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  For starters, I recommend the very rich Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the flavorful Yucatan Chicken Tacos even though the portion sizes are small for the price.  A selection of complimentary breads comes with the meal and they are quite unique.  Use caution with the Blue Corn Cake Muffin, though, because it's very crumbly and likely to end up all over you if you aren't careful.  \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I can't rave enough about the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin.  I've never had Pork that cuts like butter and rests in the perfect amount of spicy goodness.  Other contenders are the Coffee rubbed filet mignon and the chipotle glazed rib-eye.  For side dishes, don't pass up the roasted corn or Chorizo-goat cheese tamale.  Salmon is usually my favorite dish, but the Ancho Chile-honey glazed salmon was just alright.\n\nThe last time I was there I couldn't find the dessert I had the time before.  When I asked about it they told me that they had a new pastry chef.  I decided to try the pineapple buttermilk upside down cake from the new dessert menu and it was divine.  I don't need the menu anymore; this is an automatic order.\n\nSo, why 4 stars instead of 5?  First, the reservations; when you call ahead you have to give them your credit card number so they can charge you $50 a head in the event that you don't show up without cancelling before 3pm the same day.  That seems ridiculous to me considering that they would have no problem filling the seats with walk ups.  Second, the food is pricey for the quantity.  I know its Vegas, but a little bigger portion for the appetizers wouldn't hurt them too much.  Finally, if you come with a big party they stick you in a not so attractive back room on a large folding table covered with a cloth.  Aside from being a bit tacky, it makes you feel isolated from the bustling atmosphere in the main dining room.  While none of these are show stoppers, it was enough to dock them a star.\n\nI'll be back to try the rest of the menu."

My wife is diabetic; we asked our waiter if my wife could simply substitute out sauces; he steamrolled over our questions, telling us which sauces would be fine. Ok. She ordered the swordfish, my son and I both ordered the pork tenderloin. We both sub'd the chorizo & goat cheese tamale for the sweet potato version.  When the food came out (different waiter) we explained again that my wife could not have some of the sauces; he was super, swapped in more tomatillo salsa. However, the tamales were just so sweet that I told the waiter we had gotten the wrong ones. They were cloyingly sweet, and there was no goat cheese detectable, absolutely no taste of chorizo. So then he started arguing with me, pointing to one or two 1/4\" size pieces. I told him there was no way this could be the chorizo tamale. So what does he do? Brings out two more. Same thing, dessert sweet, tiny piece of  goat cheese added on top. I tell him the same thing,  Finally, manager comes over with two MORE tamales (one of each). I tell him there's no need, just that we can't be getting the right one. He goes to check with the chef and sure enough, he says they add sugar to the masa. Manager was very gracious, told him we'd had nothing but attitude from waiter. Again, apologetic, but our meal ruined by now so I pass on dessert that's part of my meal.  They don't swap waiters. Check comes, no break at all. I left 0 tip which I never do; but if the manager reads this, he knows which waiter needs to be blamed for this bad dining experience. Huge disappointment."

Sorry, but after this most-disappointing meal, I can't help pay your feed bills again.\n\nWe arrived early on a weekday and the place was fairly crowded.  We both ordered the Salmon--one medium-rare and one medium.  I was halfway through mine when I realized I was give the medium-rare one and not the medium I had ordered.  The waiter never bothered to check that one may have been cooked differently.  Wound up leaving the half of my undercooked fish because of it.  Suggest you talk to your servers about this type of mix-up.\n\nMashed potatoes and the twice-baked were extremely disappointing.  The mashed were very watery with an afterthought of some type of chile sauce or something on top.  The puny and tasteless half-baked was just that and it looked like it came straight out of the microwave.  It actually looked a little forlorn.\n\nAn appetizer (shrimp tamale) was OK, nothing special. Also  had two glasses of imported wine which was decent, as was the service, though that seemed rushed as times.\n\nAgain, I was extremely disappointed with this meal and would not recommend Mesa Grill to anyone.  Maybe it was an off night, but you never get a second chance to make a good first impression with me, anyway."

The food is lovely, but I think you can find better food for the cost.\n\n Some large positives are that the depth of flavor is great, unexpected and enjoyable ( I had queso fundido and a pink and green peppercorn crusted filet). Also, I couldn't decide what to order for a cocktail and the waitress promptly told me that their bartender was experimenting with some new drinks and that she would be happy to surprise me.  The two that I had were excellent, some of the best cocktails I have had in Vegas (one tasted like a green tea lemon drop and the other a martini with tasty but unidentifiable herbs).\n\n  The things I find lacking are: 1) Portion size. I can handle small portions if the food is exquisitely rich and exotic, but its fancy Mexican food, so small wasn't cuttin' it; 2) The restaurant seemed ridiculously small, which made the seating a little crowded and reservations extremely difficult; 3) If you are a Food Network star then you should be wowing me with your amazing cuisine- I am under-wowed.\n\n All in all, a great place to try and definitely get a cocktail, but don't expect your mind to be blown."

First, I was a little surprised that it was \"build your own taco\", but whatever. The shrimp were cooked fine, but they were over seasoned and so instead of flavor I just tasted sodium. The cabbage slaw topping was really tasty and the condiments were fresh and tasty. The bread basket was very good, especially the jalape\u00f1o bread.\n\nThe price was a little steep for essentially 6 shrimp, some cabbage and bread (I just had water for drink) ...30 after tip."

Located right in the middle of the casino, you can easily walk by this place and think nothing of it.. However the next time you pass through Caesars Palace casino and see this restaurant make sure to give it a second or third glance because you need to try this place out.. For those foodies out there that watch the food network 24 hours a day, like me.  you probably know Bobby Flay and it just happens this is one of his establishments... And Mr. Flay has trained his chefs well, for they can sure put out tasty plates of mouth watering goodness..  Southwestern flavors are what you are going to get here so expect some kick in the spice department and you can't be afraid of some heat as well, as the chefs here know how to wake you up but at the same time make your taste buds beg for more.  Lunch has samples of all the basic lunch entrees you would find at any typical restaurant however the plates here come out as sculptures and have very unique tastes that make you understand why Mr Flay is becoming such a big name..\n\nPrices for lunch are closer to the lower $20.00 range and the restaurant seemed to be well staffed however service was slow.. I have visited this place a few times over the years and service is always friendly but I did have a very slow experience this time..However this is quickly forgotten once the food comes out..  \n\nIf you like your spicy and need a wake me up with flavors come check out MESA you won't be disappointed.. My visit was without reservation but I think we got lucky for it quickly filled up and there was  line when leaving..."

His food a seriously sexy and  unforgettable \"explosion\" of flavors in my mouth again and again. Woowee! It's getting hot in here, and it's not just because of his masterful use of spices. But let's move onto the food.\n\nI went to Vegas this past weekend, and was excited to find that the people I went to didn't want to just go to the plethora of buffets that Vegas has to offer. Instead, our group ventured into the culinary adventures that Vegas had to offer, and our first stop was Mesa Grill.\n\nThree things about me:\n1) i love spicy foods\n2) i typically do not like bloody mary's (in fact, i detest them)\n3) i never get red meat past medium. (pink is where its at)\n\nWe ordered our drinks first, I ordered the margarita (which was just ok, BUT when I asked for extra tequila, the server hooked a sister up!) My other fellow food goers both ordered bloody marys. I tried a sip, and I swear I was in spicy tomato heaven. It was the best bloody bloody mary I've ever had, and I actually REGRETTED not ordering one for myself. Score 1 for Bobby Flay!\n\nNext, our server set down a bounty of delicious baked goods. (good thing because we were starving) Now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. The basket alone could have made up a meal, and I would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) The assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! Now that's dedication!\n\nNext, the three of us ordered the Mesa Burger, Scrambled Egg Enchilada, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs. \n\nMy burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). The fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for Flay.  The burger was HUGE accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. I could have stopped here, and Flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet. \n\nNext the Scrambled Egg Enchiladas. Scrambled eggs with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. The great thing I loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. Instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. Scrumptious!\n\nI was perfectly satisfied, but Flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  I had to try the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. I was unsure about the dish- thought the sweet potatoes might have been overkill. However, I took a bite, and I was in food heaven. It was everything you want in a meal. Well balanced flavors, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy.  I was so full, but I couldn't stop eating. I wanted more. I needed more. It was the perfect climatic end to a delicious meal. \n\nAs Rhett S. said, if you go to Vegas and have not made it to Mesa, you havent really experienced Vegas at all.  I would drive 4 hours just to try it again!"

I went in last night for my anniversary with my girlfriend and I was completely disappointed.\n\nWhen you call and make a reservation you don't actually deal with the restaurant, but you go through the hotel. I had to give a credit card number to make a reservation for two. The lady who took my reservation didn't ask if we were celebrating a special occasion or not, which you would expect from a nice restaurant.\n\nWhen we got there we were sat promptly and ordered some drinks. The drinks came out quick which is the only real compliment I can give this place. The busboy was also adept at keeping our water glasses full.\n\nWe asked our waiter for a recommendation for an appetizer. He recommended the tiger shrimp tamale. It was bland and tasteless and was definitely not worth the $16. The sauce served no purpose on the dish, and it seemed sloppily executed. From watching Bobby Flay on t.v. I was expecting a dish with bold flavors. Instead we were served cafeteria food.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the 22oz rib eye medium. The steak came out raw, and I had to send it back to the kitchen. After 5 minutes or so I finally got my steak which was still raw, but not worth the trouble of sending it back. Now I've worked in restaurants before. If I or the kitchen made a mistake I would own up to it by comping a drink or desert or whatever. I was given an apology, but nothing more. To me this indicated that they did not care what I thought or if I would ever come back here.\n\nAnother thing that made me slightly angry was that no one took the time to ask if we were celebrating a special occasion. In all fairness to the restaurant we might have had a bad server. Attention to detail separates great or even good restaurants from places like this one.\n\nIt makes me angry to think that I spent $200+ on a sub-par dinner. Last year we went to Rosemary's and were blown away by their service. If you are going to spend good money on dinner, then the food and service must be executed with a certain level of competency.\n\nThis restaurant is over-priced, and not worth the trouble. Don't waste your money here, and don't buy into the hype that is Bobby Flay."

The dishes here have a Southwestern theme, but the flavors are richer than what many might associate with Southwestern cuisine.\n\nWe made reservations for dinner, and between four entrees, four sides, and two appetizers, there was just one side (the double-baked potato) that our party of four considered less than superb. My very expensive steak was an outstanding cut and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and he painted an excellent picture with his recommendations.  He was also on top of refilling our water all evening, which after a day walking around in the Vegas heat was definitely appreciated.\n\nI did not find the atmosphere at all stuffy or snooty, nor is it particularly glamorous given its location, but make no mistake, this is still an upscale restaurant.  Expect it to make a major dent in your wallet.  On the other hand, no one in my party left feeling we had overpaid, which says a lot about the quality of the food and service.  Mesa Grill is one of those places you eat at to enjoy a \"dining experience,\" not just to grab a good bite to eat, so make it part of a special day or night in Las Vegas.  It's certainly an experience I will never forget."

Say yes to the Margarita and the bread!\n\nThat said, here's a bit more detail:\nThe corn soup was creamy - crunchy (not sure what was in it, but it gave it a great texture) and delish! Perfect - could eat it all day. Margarita - also perfection, and their was a variety of bread - sweet and savory. \n\nAfter all this, I did still have room for my Chile Relleno. The breading was a little too hard / crunchy in my opinion, but it wasn't so off-putting that I didn't thoroughly enjoy what was underneath. \n\nWe did not get dessert - the coconut cake was being touted as the \"specialty\".\n\nAnd that's where I think the negative is with Mesa Grill - there was far too much \"this is our specialty\" for every course. The menu is not overly huge, and I find it a little cheesy to be telling people what to choose (unless they ask!). I did not choose any of the \"specialties\" and I thought my choices were perfect. Also, the service was a bit too fast. It was fine, but it felt very much like there was a focus on turning tables as quickly as possible. Ambiance was typical of a Vegas celeb restaurant - in this case, very open and comfortable seating arrangements.\n\nI would go back for sure. I might even order the same thing, and perhaps try dessert!"

Decided to try lunch on a Wednesday and thought that it might be a good idea to go in on Tuesday and make a reservation. But once we found out that we would be charged $50 per person if our group of four cancelled after 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday monring we decided to just take our chances and show up as walk ins. ( I mean really, it's Vegas! I won't even be awake until noon so how could I call and cancel before 9:00 a.m.?) Don't know if that would work on a weekend, but we did fine walking in at 1:30 on a Wednesday.\n\nFirst, the service: wonderful! Attentive without being obtrusive. Friendly without being overly chummy. Obviously a restaurant that puts some time and energy into training the wait staff, which I appreciate. \n\nNext, the food: also wonderful! I had the fixed price lunch menu for $29. You get a choice of one of two appetizers, one of two entrees and the chef's special dessert. Price-wise it's like getting dessert for free. For the appetizer I had the Blue Corn Grilled Duck Pancake which was like a soft taco with shredded duck in the most delicious barbecue sauce I have ever tasted. Buffalo burger for the entree - quite good though a little dry. That's the buffalo meat tho' which is very lean. The dessert was warm chocolate cake which was excellent - not overly sweet, just the taste of good chocolate. And they had great coffee!\n\nMy husband had the pork tenderloin sandwich, which he expected to be hot but was served cold. Very tasty though. Two young adults with us had the coffee-rub steak sandwich which was very good - tender meat that was easy to eat sandwhich style and french fries with a slightly spicy seasoning.\n\nThe menu has so many interesting sounding dishes that we will certainly be back to try more. I thought the prices were fair for Las Vegas, particularly on the lunch menu - things are a little pricier at dinner. Except for the idea of charging people $50 each for missing a reservation, I thought this was a great restaurant."

Nice ambiance inside. Its easy to forget you're in the middle of a casino. However, the meal itself just didn't measure up to my expectations. Yeah it's in Vegas & owned by a celebrity chef so we expected to spend a few hundred dollars but we also expected it the be a great meal. It wasn't. I'd say somewhere between okay and pretty good but by no means great. Of the dishes that I remember...\n\nAPPETIZERS\nBread Basket - not an app but still worth mentioning. it's full of different kinds of bread and the jalapeno cheese corn bread it good. grab it before someone else at your table does. \nBlue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - pretty good. the BBQ sauce carried most of the flavor and you couldn't taste the duck. still pretty good though.\nTiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - good flavor combinations. proly my favorite item overall. kinda small though. Looking at the name I was thinking they were serving Tiger Prawn but these are just regular-ass scrimps. \nTuna Nachos - Meh. pretty creative but didn't come with a lot of flavor\n\nENTREES\nFilet - filet was good but I wouldn't put it in my top 5 & considering it was $50, I feel like it really should have been better. The temperature was right on the money but it was just missing something. \nGrilled Chicken - i thought grilled chicken would be way to boring for a Bobby Flay restaurant but it's on the menu. It's exactly what you think it is...grilled chicken. It was juicy but again nothing to get excited about. \nPan Seared Sea Scallops - These were actually pretty good.\n\nI also ordered 2 margaritas and they were on par with everything else...so so. I really wanted to luv this place but the items we tried just didn't live up to the hype. Would I eat there again? Maybe for lunch. Dinner wasn't worth $325 for 4 ppl in my opinion."

I have to branch out, but almost always order the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  It is an amazing dish that has just the right balance of spicy heat and smokiness.  The tenderloin has a pleasant hint of heat and avoids frying your taste-buds so you can enjoy the entree.  Another favorite of mine is the Sophie's Chop Salad, which is another great example of balance.  The salad is visually appealing and has perfect proportions of flavors and textures.  The whole experience may be pricey, but is worth it."

I'd thought about going when I went back and visited, but never did. So, when we were visiting Vegas and friends asked if we'd like to join them for Thanksgiving lunch at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace, we said \"for sure!\"\n\nMesa Grill was featuring a Thanksgiving menu, but we decided not to order from it. It would have been nice to actually have turkey on Thanksgiving, but we came to try the food that Flay is known for, and so we ordered from the regular menu. This is what we had:\n\n- Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: Corn-Cilantro Sauce\n- Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\": Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips\n- Oyster Special: Can't remember exactly what was in these, but they were cooked oysters put back in the shell with some sauce\n- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin: Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce, Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter\n- Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast: Carrot-Habanero Sauce, Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale + Thyme Butter\n- Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: Tangerine-Roasted Jalapeno-Mint Sauce + Plantain Tamale with Molasses Butter\n\nI really liked the cheese appetizer, of course. Unlike other fundido I've had, the addition of goat cheese added a nice tanginess to the appetizer. I also really liked the tamale. For the entrees, I had the duck, Friend1 had the pork and Friend 2 and Friend 3 both got the lamb. We all tasted each other's food and everyone agreed that the pork was the tastiest. We all enjoyed the duck as well. It was agreed that the lamb was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Overall, I was glad to try Flay's food, but I wasn't head over heels."

Last night we dined at Mesa Grill and the food was amazing.  \n\nI'd planned for this meal all day - akin to preparing for the civilized version of Nathan's hotdog eating contest.  A small breakfast of oatmeal, half a sandwich for lunch, plenty of water.  (Yeah, this is probably how I should eat every day...but we'll avoid that topic for now).  \n\nI've had lunch at Mesa Grill before, and that meal had me excited for the dinner.  Back then I had the Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewers.  Think of it as a build your own taco.  The chicken is traditionally grilled on wood skewers (hence the name).  You build it yourself with \"special lettuce\" (a blend of mint, butter lettuce, and cilantro.  Genius.) and a New Mexico Chile Sauce that tastes more like a mole sauce that a chile sauce.  I love good food, especially good Mexican (excuse me, Southwestern Cuisine), and I was clearly really looking forward to another opportunity to dine at Mesa Grill.  \n\nNo surprise to anyone who knows me, I arrived on time for dinner.  My guests did not.  But the staff was pleasant and courteous none the less, even though they had to refer several people to the \"first come, first served\" bar area as they were booked for the evening.\n\nWhen my guests finally arrived (OK, they were only 15 minutes late.  'Traffic\"), we started with mojitos (five stars), and the self explanatory Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (a little dry, but tasty none the less).\n\nFor dinner we had:\n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno with eggplant, manchego cheese, and sweet red pepper sauce.  I love the presentation on this dish.\n\nNew Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with bourbon - ancho chile sauce, sweet potato tamale, and crushed pecan butter.  It was really spicy.  I mean REALLY spicy.  I had this medium - pink in the center, delicious.  And the tamale (yeah, another one.  let's not count the calories) had chunks of pecan in the pecan butter.  Happiness.\n\nFinally the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with blackberry - cascabel barbecue sauce (brilliant!), and collard greens with smoked chiles.  It didn't disappoint. \n\nThe meal took us an hour and a half.  It felt like 15 minutes.  It was a great experience and time literally flew by (mainly because there are no clocks in the casinos).  If you're planning on seeing a show after dinner, give yourself an extra hour or so.  You'll probably need it. \n\nThe meal was a bit pricey ($200+ for three), but well worth it.  I've noticed that the lunch menu had many of the same items as the dinner menu - just smaller portions and priced accordingly."

Bobby taught me to make grilled pineapple topped with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with caramel sauce: plus one point. Bobby then introduced me to a burger courtesy of his Palace that artfully rivaled McDonalds'. He then uncapped another layer and surprised me with a fantastically gorgeous meal at Mesa Grill. \n\nWith a brilliant introduction to his culinary prowess, Flay served up the triumvirate of Southwestern breads: a blue and yellow sweet cornbread, a sourdough dotted with jalapeno and a third nameless but tasty glutenous indulgence.\n\nThe BBQ-ed ribs were served Kansas City style - fall off the bone tenderness and a smokey undertone was complimented by a viscous sauce dazzled with crushed peanuts.\n\nThe King Shrimp tamale proved that seafood and mesa really can combine for a dish so wonderful you'll wonder why your grandmother didn't go fishing in the Gulf (or the Bay of Boston) for fat shrimp...and why she refused to grind her own corn for a thick tamale. But most of all, this King Shrimp Tamale will force you to order a regular tamale from the side menu because they're so damn irresistible...and when you go back to your cozy nook on the East Coast, you'll bemoan the lack of true American Southwestern cuisine. And if you're headed to more southern provinces closer to the border, you're likely to cry fraud at the actually authentic dishes presented at your local digs...because Bobby twisted the tamale flavor in just the right way.\n\nForget the banana dessert. It looks like bananas...and have another special margarita...because without it, your meal just won't be complete."

Our experience unfolded with mixed feelings...\n\nFOOD:\nI ordered from the special restaurant week menu they had going on, three courses for just over 50 bucks which is a great deal.  The salad I chose for course  number one was top notch!  Not too hefty on the lettuce, crunchy white and blue corn chip pieces, perfect amount and type of cheese, and great dressing.  Then I had the ever-raved-about pork tenderloin.  Perfectly cooked, good balance of flavor, but insanely spicy.  I'm a southern gal, I like spice, but wow...  This one should have a warning on it. The tamale that comes with does an ok job of balancing the heat, and is absolutely delicious by itself, but I was glad I had plenty of water and a yummy white peach margarita to wash it all down.  Third course was a chocolate pudding with salted caramel something or other.  It was tasty; I also could have easily made it at home.  \nBF had the rib eye.  It looked good.  Flavor was great.  Unfortunately, the cook was way off.  He asked for mid rare, and got super duper rare.  It bordered on undercooked.  BF got a side of corn which, I didn't care for but, he loved which is surprising because he hates cheese.\n\nSo... Mixed thoughts on food\n\nSERVICE/AMBIANCE:\nAmazing!!  Perfect balance of casual atmosphere and fine dining.  The entire front of house staff is spectacular.  Kind, professional, caring, and timely without being stuffy or overly doting.  We tipped big because we found everyone deserving - from the hostess to our waiter to the guy with the water.\n\n\n\nSo all in all, a pretty fine choice."

That didn't dawn on us...). Since we were staying at Caesars, we thought of the restaurants in the hotel and thought of Mr. Flay.

YAY! \n\nWe were all starving after all flying into Vegas and having such a late dinner. We munched on the free bread which was nothing spectacular. After reading over the menu, we made our selections: one ordered the pork tenderloin, another ordered the salmon, two ordered the chicken, and one ordered the cioppino. I had a NY strip because nothing really jumped out at me.  It was cooked to a perfect rare and it tasted fine but nothing very special or fancy about it. \n\nWe split the following sides:\n+Corn: good but very, very creamy.

Alternative is to eat at the bar however everyone needs to be 21 years old. \n\nWe sat at a table all the way at the back where you can view the sports betting area. These tables are a bit weird though and best avoided ( see picture) as the have a large mound like bit under the table which you end up having to place your feet on. It feels odd and uncomfortable. Go for the four legged table instead on the lower level.\n\nWe had spicy peppers cheese dip and blue corn tortillas for started which was excellent! For the main we had medium rare mesa burger. It was good. Caramelized onions, cheese and served with some excellent mustard ( English i think) The fries were great. My brother had the shrimp tacos. He said it was good but it was too pricey for what you get. 6 shrimp, two soft tacos and some salad stuff. Tasty but not worth the price. Best avoided! Would I come back, maybe.  I thought the food was good but did feel it was a bit pricey. It probably deserves 3 1/2 stars."

The appetizers were the real highlight: the shrimp tamale, chicken quesidilla, and chicken taco, and blue corn pancake were all one of a kind taste experiences with so many amazing flavors. The bread basket was also great with three unique flavorful varities. On to the entrees the Chile Relleno was admittedly forgettable. The New York Strip Steak was excellent quality but not uniquely flavored more than other excellent steaks at Morton's, etc so if you are going for the unique experience you should not just get the steak, though perhaps you can split it like we did. The Grouper and Cioppino were both excellent and the sauce in the latter was so good we were all dipping our bread in it at the end of the meal. I tried the Mashed Potatoes with white queso sauce and they were good too, but you can only do so much with mashed potatoes and the appetizers were better I think. We had a great dining experience here and so can you, just be sure to try a few different appetizers, share your entrees to get all the flavors, and trust the chefs with all the intriguing combinations offered on the menu. The margaritas and the service are great too and it was well worth the experience to go. I can't wait to go again and try more of the items on the menu, as everything was a new experience."

            "review": "I rate restaurants on four things: the food I eat, the way I am treated, how comfortable the environment is while I'm eating, and how much all of this costs.  This means I don't eat at a restaurant because a celebrity is associated with it, and therefore any feelings I may have - positive or otherwise - in regard to said celebrity, don't mess with my meal. Good food is a serious business.  It should never be adulterated with bile. \n\nTHE FOOD\nAfter consulting with the waiter, I ordered a cocktail... a Cactus Pear Margarita, a Blue Corn Pancake appetizer, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.  \n\nThe Cactus Pear Margarita (Herradura Silver Tequila, cactus pear syrup and lime juice) had a strong background flavor of grapefruit, which was not to my taste.  The replacement drink was a White Peach Margarita (white peach puree, Herradura Silver Tequila, lime juice).  It was exquisite.  A perfect balance of flavors.  Not too sweet.  Not too sour.  Not excessively fruity.  \n\nMeanwhile I had the bread basket to explore. It included three breads; a jalapeno cornbread muffin, a slice of nutty whole wheat, and a few wedges of light as air foccacia.  Okay... the muffin was actually the highlight of my entire day.  Maybe several days.  Crumbly, salty sweet, just spicy enough to be interesting.  I immediately wanted a dozen more, and my appetizer hadn't even arrived.  Later I sampled the whole wheat - which was somewhat pedestrian after the muffin, and the foccacia - another delicious surprise.  I could have dined on bread alone and gone away full and happy.  But more was to come.  \n\nThe Blue Corn Pancake is just that, a blue corn pancake filled with barbecued duck, topped with at least three sauces, including the habanero chile and star anise listed on the menu.  The blend of flavors was powerful, exotic, and extremely rich.  People who cannot or don't care for spicy foods should avoid this dish.  The heat of the smoky sweet barbecued duck was balanced with the mild blue corn, then kicked again into high gear with the sauces.  Wow!\n\nThe Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was... well, interesting.  Topped with a poached egg the combination was relatively mild.  The consistency of the whole dish was soft, almost deceptively so, because the sauces drizzled over the dish were quite spicy. I ate half and brought the rest of it home to Los Angeles to eat later.  It was actually better tasting when I heated it up the next day.  \n\nSince I was taking leftovers home, I went ahead and ordered a dessert.  The waiter and I spent some time talking about what would travel well, eventually settling on the Smoked Vanilla & Toasted Walnut Flan.  Actually, it was a coffee flavored flan with a smoky vanilla caramel top and some candied walnuts on the side. I may sound more blase than I feel, but the description on the dessert menu just did not do it justice.  Even after being hauled onto a plane and stuck in a refrigerator for a day, the flan was creamy, subtly flavored, and absolutely splendid. \n\nIn fact, the whole meal was a five star experience.  It takes a truly superb kitchen to create the effortless complexity of flavor and presentation I got at Mesa.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nI had my luggage with me when I came into the restaurant and the Greeter immediately offered to put it aside in a private locked closet. Although she didn't give me a claim ticket, she did recognize me when I left.  I did wonder how that all works when the restaurant is particularly busy.\n\nAs you can tell already, I take up a waiter's time.  I expect them to be knowledgeable about the menu, familiar with the dishes, and to have an opinion (their favorites).  I did not order the waiter's favorites, but any really good waiter appreciates fine food and WILL have at least one dish on the menu that they rave about.  Great restaurants hire great waiters.  Mesa Grill gets five stars here as well.  Not only did I have a great waiter, I had two, plus a busboy who might as well have been a third, and a personable bartender who brought me my second drink ... AND STOOD THERE waiting to make sure I was happy with it. \n\nMind you, I was there at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday.  So most people should not expect to get quite this level of attention, but I have no doubt that these guys are steller even at the most hectic of times. I really put them to the test at the end. I asked to have the hash and a couple of those amazing muffins packed along with the flan.  Then I had them repack it so that I could fit it into my carry on bag.  No fuss.  No looks.  Just whatever help I seemed to need.  (many thanks Joel, Dario & Adam!) \n\nI would write a longer review, but I have run out of room.  Let me just say that the environment was excellent (quiet, light enough to see, but not too bright, and the bathroom was clean), and the bill, including tip was under $75.  For this level of restaurant, that's dirt cheap."

I had been here in the past and wanted to come again as I had thoroughly enjoyed it every time.\n\nWhenever I was seated I was disappointed to get the brunch menu instead of the normal lunch menu.  That meant no chile relleno that I had picked out earlier.  Instead I decided upon the 16 spice chicken salad with a side of chorizo. The salad was plated beautifully and the first bite of chicken provided my palate with the many spices.  Sadly I soon lost those spices in the rest of the salad.  It had a green onion  vinaigrette dressing on top with goat cheese and fancy lettuce.  Overall, I really enjoyed the salad.  The chorizo was also good but a bit overcooked.  It started out with a slightly sweet taste before finishing off spicy.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future the next time that I am in Vegas.  All of my previous meals here I would have given 5 stars but this time it was only worthy of 4."

I was looking at the \"green chile crostini salad with anchovies and ricotta\" but the bartender recommended other things.  I ended up getting the grilled octopus salad with smoked paprika, shallots and lime.  It was divine, 2 whole tentacles, and reminded me of grilled octopus in NYC.

Portions were great here, almost too much.  Unlike the apps - small portions big prices.  Duck \"taco\" - 1 small blue corn soft tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of duck -$16.00.  Hard to share with 3 other people - about a tiny bite each! Hard for me to understand the price,although it was tasty.  The corn tamale with shrimp was delicious, a little better portion, but was described as having 4 jumbo shrimp - they were hardly jumbo, although we each did get one, and the flavors were good. Again, overpriced at $14 or $16 I can't remember.\nBiggest disappointment was service.  Friendly and knowledgeable, yes.\nWe ordered a pretty pricey bottle of wine, and when we ordered apps and told the waiter we would like to hold off on entrees for a few minutes, he basically informed us that we had to order everything at once, they were busy, yada yada yada.  There are few things that aggravate me more at a high end restaurant than when they dictate when I have to order what.  What is this, Dennys?  They can't manage a simple delay of ordering entrees?  Mostly, i just felt they were rushing us so they could fill up our table again.  Big no,no for me.  \nIf you are a Bobby Flay fan, and want ot see how close you come to making his food at home, eating here is a must. (It's not that hard to duplicate his recipes, they are fairly easy, and from this experience I see I can do it spot on).  The real true test for me of any restaurant is would I go back?\nNope!  There is a lot of great places in Vegas I would go back to, and have, BUT this is not one of them.  Easily duplicated, and very pricey, combined with Dennys mentality on the service make it a ONE TIME ONLY EXPERIENCE."

I am not a big Bobby Flay fan so I was a bit hesitant to dine here for the first time but I'm glad my friends and I finally did it! We tried this place for lunch and started with the most awesome complimentary bread basket that included this blue and yellow jalape\u00f1o corn bread that was to die for! For starters we ordered the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamales- scrumptious is one word to describe it! This dish truly got my attention, Bobby! We also ordered Rough Cut Tuna Nachos- so refreshing and yummy. For our main courses we ordered the Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewer-grilled just right. Smoked Shrimp Tacos-very well seasoned and cooked to perfection not dry at all. Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich-a great panini type sandwich with fine dining quality. For desert we ordered the most amazing Banana Bread Pudding that left me speechless coz all I want to do is savor and eat it! The service we had was great and our server was very attentive. Ambiance has a very modern feel with lots of colored vase to reflect the southwestern theme of the place.\nThis restaurant is definitely a must try when in Vegas!"

Our group of 6 came here for dinner and left quite happily and satisfied. \nOf all our dishes though, I highly recommend the Tiger Shrimp Blue Corn Tamale for appetizer and Grilled Mahi Mahi. The creaminess of the tamale and the sweet/ sour/ slightly spicy pineapple sauce drizzled on the fish will definitely send you to heaven!\nOne disappointment was our drinks. 2 of us ordered \"Gimme a Lemonade\" (green tea vodka + lemonade). It was very bitter and we could not taste any sour-ness of lemonade. It tasted like water down vodka. But maybe it's supposed to be this way?\nI give Mesa Grill 4 out of 5 because it didn't impress us with as much punch as some other places we tried in the next few days."

            "review": "***Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill showcases several good starters and entrees with generous portions, but the menu hardly changes; it is good option if you have never been, but if you have been to Mesa Grill, a return visit might leave you disappointed with the restaurant lacking the ambition to challenge itself and try new things (you cannot really blame the restaurant though given its popularity as well as customers' satisfaction with Mesa Grill's signature dishes)***\n\nI have been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill a few times and it consistently delivers tasty and well prepared food.  Unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  That is the case with a lot of Las Vegas restaurants (for example, Picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  Still, almost the entire menu at Mesa Grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.\n\nThe familiar menu has pros and cons.  What it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and true.  In addition, most guests come to Las Vegas rarely and would likely only dine at Mesa Grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  On the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; Mesa Grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.\n\nI started with their tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale.  It is a popular dish and for good reason.  The tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  The shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though I personally would have preferred it to be spicier.\n\nFor my entree, I went with their New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Unlike the shrimp and corn tamale, this entree was incredibly spicy.  The pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  There was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).\n\nThe pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  The pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  The sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the corn tamale from my starter.\n\nMy dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  It was very similar to Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  The cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  The cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a Ralphs or Vons).  There was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.\n\nService was fine.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  I felt the staff could have been more attentive.\n\nPrices are actually not that bad at Mesa Grill.  Prices are very high, but that is common with most Las Vegas restaurants.  At least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.\n\nThe dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  It is a very comfortable dining room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  There are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  Given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.\n\nThere are definitely some good (and even great) things about Mesa Grill.  They have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  If you have never been to Mesa Grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you have been already though, Mesa Grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.\n\nMesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace.  Like most major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both complimentary self and valet parking."

Our waiter came up every five minutes trying to take our plates, pouring water in between us and our conversations, asking questions... I understand being diligent but this was annoying. \n\nThe pork loin was the best thing any of us got. It was definitely very good. So was the shrimp tamale. I think that's actually the best thing on the menu, but quite rich so you can split that and the pork with someone and be totally satisfied as the portions are huge.\n\nOne of us had the coffee crusted steak, and the rub was just too spicy to really enjoy the meat. The fish was bland and slightly overcooked. Desserts were awful. Seriously, how hard is it to make good churros? The donuts at a fast food restaurant are better!\n\nIf you are a fan of Bobby Flay's other restaurants -- Bar Americain is one of my favorites -- you will be very disappointed here. The quality, service and atmosphere are just so mediocre it really disappoints. Oh, and the price - I think it's more expensive than eating in his restaurant in Manhattan, which is just mind-boggling because this is Vegas, for God's sake."

Yeah, our third trip in 5 months...we may have a problem.\n\nAnyway, we went at about 11:30 am on a Saturday, and were seated in about 5 minutes. They happened to be running a special that they run once a year that involved a preset menu with a couple of different options for $30. Not bad.\n\nWe ordered the:\n\nDuck served on a blue corn pancake-the duck was DELICIOUS, and both the sauce that the duck was cooked in and the sauce on the plate were delicious. The meat was very tender and flavorful. I am not always crazy about duck, so this was a pleasant surprise \n\nGreen Chili Burger with fries-Ok, think big thick burger patty. It was juice and delicious and cooked right to order. My boyfriend often complains that burgers are overdone, even if you ask for them radium rare or medium, and he said this one was just perfect. If you get a chance walk by the grill and look at all of the burgers being cooked. \nSorbet -Mango, Pear, and Raspberry. They were all good but I really liked the nice soft flavor of the pair.\n\nBread-The bread comes with each table, and I am only mentioned it because it was kind of different. There were several different little selections, such as a cranberry scone, a corn muffin, a coffee cake, and something else sweet. The bread basket was a unique and unexpected touch.\n\nI would definitely come here again. Good food, good service, nice atmosphere and a great location within Caesars."

            "review": "Making a reservation here was a HUGE mistake. We were in Vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday.The night started off great - good drinks - nice server - and a tasty looking menu. We ordered some apps for the table, and each got entrees, which we agreed they were average at best. I'd spoke to the server about a birthday dessert for my friend - which took too long to arrive. Things started to get sketchy. My friend slipped a different server a credit card part way through the meal to ensure our birthday friend would not pay. Upon finishing dessert, we expected to receive the bill and credit card, as it was late and there was only 1 other table. After bringing the $900+ bill, it was missing the credit card, and we had to ask them to go find it. My friend grew increasingly nervous, as her credit card had been in the back for over 30 minutes. Once the card was returned, the server very unprofessionally complained to the nearby table about how we were unhappy with the missing card - we called him out and he rolled his eyes. As the other table prepared to leave, so did we. Here's when things got WAY WORSE. Once we were officially the only people in the restaurant besides the staff, we gathered our things and headed towards the door. As the door closed behind us, I realized that I left my phone at the table. I walked directly back there, no more than 60 seconds after leaving, the linens and table were being cleared, but my phone was suspiciously missing. I rechecked all of my pockets and emptied my purse and then asked my friends to call my phone in hopes of locating it. It rang all the way to voicemail but could not be heard anywhere in the empty restaurant. I know that my phone was most recently at the table because a friend has a photo of me with my phone at 11:18pm taking birthday pictures. I never left the table between then and when we got up to leave at 11:48 pm. My anxiety increased. The server who had misplaced the credit card insisted that I had gone to the bathroom and possibly left it there where someone else likely took it. That's totally untrue, which I insisted. The hostess insisted that she hadn't seen my phone.  At this point I verbally said \"I will use find my iPhone\". There were 3 employees (2 men, 1 woman) in street clothes at the bar - clearly done working. As I passed them starting to login to the 'find my iPhone' app, one of the men said 'OK we gotta bounce'. I started to panic but didn't want to cast judgment. Could they have actually stolen my phone? Approximately 30 seconds after they left the restaurant, I'd logged into Find my iPhone, only to see that my phone was 'offline'. My friend called my phone again - it had been shut off and going straight to voicemail. Strange, because I had at least 70% battery before dinner. At this point I became furious, and felt helpless. I demanded to speak to the manager on duty. The manager strolled out and I quickly informed him of the situation. Confused, he asked, \"why would anyone steal your iPhone? They can't do anything with it.\" Are you f-ing kidding me?! Shocked, I questioned him about the 3 employees that just left a minute ago. He rudely responded, \"I don't know, I have a lot of employees. I'd have to look at a schedule.\" I refuted, \"what kind of manager doesn't know the people on his floor? One of your employees clearly just stole my phone and you are standing here not trying to help me at all. This is f-ing absurd. I want to go to security and see surveillance videos.\" He unwillingly took me to security, but never questioned any of his employees if they had my phone. Dealing with security was an even bigger headache. A young, extremely rude kid was rolling his eyes and smirking as we attempted to file a report and obtain information on what the next steps were to actively locate my phone before it was too late. We requested the head of security - finally someone who showed some customer service and actually listened to us. He assured us they would investigate that night and watch the surveillance videos and agreed it seemed like my phone had been stolen. He also apologized for his colleagues behavior and said someone would lose their job over this. 90 minutes later, I realized the only choice now was to leave, without my phone, and that it was gone. I know it is just a phone that can be replaced but I felt violated and taken advantage of, which is why I decided to write this review. This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had! I understand everyone makes mistakes, but it is how you handle the situation that I believe is the most important, because that will determine the lasting impression. Unfortunately for Mesa Grill and Caesar's Palace, they made a very large mistake, and failed to handle the situation with any respect, integrity, or professionalism. Therefore myself, and the 9 other people that witnessed this atrocity will never go back to the hotel or any associated restaurants, and I highly recommend you don't either."

It was Bobby Flay all the way--there was a corn waffle, a tamale, and plenty of cilantro everything on the menu (and if watch Iron Chef America, you know he always does a corn waffle, a tamale, and his \"signature\" sauces). \n\nI have to say that I was sold--I would highly recommend Mesa Grill. I had the salad that is a riff on a Caesar--it has a Mexican soft and salty cheese instead of parmesan and has these absolutely wonderful riffs on croutons. In fact, the fake croutons are what made the dish for me. If I could have just had a big pile of those, I would have been a very happy camper. I would eat this salad at every meal if I had the chance.\n\nSince it was technically brunch, I had the spicy chicken and hash. It was okay, but not spectacular--the eggs were a little underdone for me and there was a lot of cilantro in the hash (too much in my mind). But, I tasted the steak and eggs that my lunch companion ordered and the steak was amazing. I only wished I had ordered that. So, learn from my mistakes: order the steak and eggs.\n\nThe breads that came with the meal where tasty--a corn/blueberry muffin, a cranberry/raisin scone, and a coffee cake; the scone was definitely the best.\n\nOrder the salad. Order the steak. Thank me. And, remember, Picky E never recommends a salad unless its unbelievably good."

I remember the sweet potato soup I had on the prior visit was just as delicious.  He then got the cuban burger with fries and I got the blue corn crusted halibut with tomatoes, capers and olives.  I liked the burger more than my husband did but refused to switch because the halibut was even better!!!  We kind of split both dishes and each bite was more delicious than the last.  The fish was cooked absolutely perfectly, not fishy, not dry, just beautiful succulent white fish.  \n\nI convinced Dr. S that we NEEDED to get dessert, even though we were both stuffed.  The buttermilk pineapple upside down cake with caramel sauce didn't disappoint!!!  It's actually one of my favorite desserts because my mom used to make it for me when I was younger.  This version, of course, blew hers out of the water, but it definitely brought me to that warm fuzzy place.  \n\nWe have had some good food in Vegas, but honestly on this last trip, I left the most satisfied after this meal because everything from the service to the food was just executed perfectly.  \n\nThanks Bobby!!!

The answer is \"yes.\"  Mesa Grill adds little touches to their food that finishes the dish.  Ice tea with simple lemon syrup, the haberno/ star anise sauce on Blue Corn Pancakes, Jalapenos on some awesome corn bread.  The only complaint is my duck was way over cooked for the Blue Corn Pancake.  Otherwise, service was incredible and food was good.  We will definitely be back to Mesa."

When it's time for a dessert selection, we also got an offer for a cup of coffee which is so right to me, I wouldn't have dessert without coffee. ^_^ I have watched a lot of Bobby Flay on TV so everything I wanted to try, I got it and I like it. You can taste a complexity of his signature sauce, close your eyes and enjoy party in your mouth. I didn't expected the best as from Bobby Flay cooks for us, so all is great and the best execute."

Good food with perfect portions, excellent service, all amid a modern and trendy Southwestern-inspired atmosphere.\n\nI ordered the bargain-priced prix-fixe lunch: the popular blue corn pancake with barbecued duck and habanero chile star anise sauce as an appetizer, buffalo burger and fries for the entree, and chef's choice for dessert -- three pastry cream puffs with a light vanilla gelato. I also sampled some of the garlic shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale as well as the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash.\n\nEvery dish was really quite good, no disappointments whatsoever. Each dish was very tasty, flavorful and often had a nice little kick to it as the spices were plentiful -- many dishes having a blend of chiles, spices or peppers, but not an overpowering amount, and added extra depth to the taste of the food."

Jalape\u00f1o, cornbread, and walnuts and cranberry.  They were all very good! \n\nOrder a rough cut tuna nachos which comes with avocado crema and mango habanero hot sauce.  The tuna was very flavourful, nicely seasoned, the chips were home made and very crispy and both sauces paired very well with the tuna.  \n\nAlso ordered a Cornmeal crusted Chile relleno with sweet pepper sauce.  It had eggplant inside, with a nice spice and vinegrette that added just the right tang! The spice wasn't too overwhelming but just enough to add a small kick! \n\nThe service was great too, had my water topped up many times!! \n\nWould love to come back during dinner after our meal today!!"

Given the Bobby Flay tag readily coupled with the mention of this place, I was sure it would be all press and no substance.\n\nI would recommend this place for brunch.  Yeah, you'll probably be looking at roughly $30 for two people not including drinks, extras or tip but I think the atmosphere and food make up for the price.  They bring you a nice array of baked goods as the \"bread\" while you wait.  All of the egg entrees are served with grits or home fries.  I ordered the scrambled egg enchiladas (eggs, chorizo, goat cheese) and they were delicious, paired with an interesting mix of sauce to provide enough spiciness to give the dish some authenticity.  My dining partner had the ranch eggs tostada which was surprisingly large and equally as tasty.  The grits were a little heavy but so tasty that I couldn't avoid eating them.\n\nProbably the only knock is that the drinks are kind of expensive (11.2oz bottle of Chimay Blue = $12) and our waitress seemed a little condescending when we told her we didn't want appetizers.  Otherwise the service was actually quite good with the waiters being right on top of refilling waters and coffee.\n\nGiven the prices you pay in Vegas, I think you could do a lot worse on price and food quality, making Mesa a pretty solid choice for any meal."

The service was impeccable, it got the point where it was borderline creepy how on-point the entire waiting staff was. All I can say is, the nice guy charged with watching my water glass better get a raise ASAP because he redefined the term \"attentive.\" \n\nDue to several factors (okay fine, one factor: Vegas taking more money than expected), I ended up dismissing the many delectable looking meat entrees and ordered the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. And holy mother of food, was it sublime. \n\nOn a more minor note, the bread is also a gamechanger.

For anyone that doesn't know, Mesa Grill is one of Bobby Flay's restaurants, and is located inside the Caesar's Palace Hotel.  \n\nWe made a reservation for 8:15, and the place was hopping when we arrived.  Living in St. Louis, I'm not used to restaurants being packed at this time, but this is par for the course in Vegas.  We were seated quickly after we arrived, more towards the back of the restaurant.  The table we had was pretty small, and was close to a few other tables.  It wasn't bad, but you could tell they were trying to get as many tables in there as possible.  I don't blame them, but I'm just stating how things are set up.\n\nThe food here is more of a southwestern/mexican style.  They offer several different appetizers and salads, but we decided to skip out on these. They do bring out some bread, which includes a cheesy type with a hint of jalapeno, corn muffins, and wheat bread.  The bread was outstanding.  I could have eaten several pieces, but I didn't want to get too full.  For our meals, I ordered the veal chop, while my wife ordered the tuna steak.  Mine came with a blue cheese type of tamale.  I thought everything was great.  Lots of flavor in every bite.  I tried my wife's food and hers was excellent as well.  We decided to order dessert, and got a pumpkin pie type of dessert.  It had caramel on top, and it was excellent.  Overall, I thought Mesa Grill was a great choice for dinner in Vegas.  I've been to a few of Bobby Flay's restaurants, and have been impressed each time.  Dinner for two here will cost you around $100.  I'm sure we'll be back here at some point."

I was happy. \n\nHAPPY.\n\nThe roasted green chile salad with goat cheese and \"crostini\" (this really was a thick slice of bread) was superb. The simple balsamic reduction rounded it all up. \n\nBf enjoyed his steak and eggs, although the steak came sliced already.

The first thing you need to do... get a mixed drink. Their mojito is incredible, but try any of the margaritas and you won't be sorry. I have eaten here at lunch and brunch, and the shrimp tamale is outstanding. Just order it. \n\nOn our last visit we had the tuna nachos, queso, and two different egg dishes as entrees. All of it was amazing! I love that the recipes use a variety of spices and seasonings, and really, anything you get here is going to be delicious. It's Vegas, and expensive, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Mesa Grill is an excellent dining option in Vegas!"

But the next day we ended up eating for lunch, and got in without waiting.  I'm expecting it to be with LOTS of Bobby Flay-esque style and design.  He seems to like the mexican flair, color scheme was of the red, green, white, yellow and orange spectrum...  The waiting area was pretty nice, and the dining room inside was pretty nice...   Food was VERY TASTY...  The blue corn pancake which had barbecued duck was definitely a single appetizer portion.  But even still, it was a small portion.  Then he had the Smoked Shrimp Tacos & Salsas and I had the Mesa Grill Burger.  The Shrimp Tacos was also a small portion.  It barely filled him up.  Luckily I couldn't finish my burger, and luckily I split it in half already.  Funny thing, the other tables surrounding us, had ordered the same things we ordered.  But overall, his food is very tasty...  I noticed as far as accompaniments with main dishes, they all seemed kinda on the spicy side...  I'm not too crazy on spicy...  but what we ordered was pretty good...  Be prepared, prices are on the \"Vegas\" side... A little pricey but pretty average for Vegas...  It's a worth check see, especially if you're a Bobby Flay Fan..."

This time we were on East Coast time, starving  with the fall-back time change, we had an extra long wait for them to open on a recent Sunday morning.  Finally they opened and we got in the line that had suddenly cropped up hoping we didn't need reservations.  After a short wait, we were led to a small table for two.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and efficient, but I don't know that he actually HEARD what we said to him.  After explaining the difference in their three signature margaritas, having had the peach one before (which he described as sour), I ordered that, and husband went for coffee.  Waiter was very very right...this drink tasted like pure sour mix.  I couldn't taste the peach at all, unlike the past when I've had it and it was very peachy.  I even questioned him about whether he had brought the right drink.  He assured me it was the right drink and I drank it doggone it...it was my duty!  Although I do remember what it USED to taste like.  Just sayin' Bobby!\n\nTIP TIP TIP:  SHARE meals here.  Share appetizers/meals/salads whatever.  I wish we had done that, but we were both so hungry that we each ordered entrees.  I opted for:  \n\nSP I C Y  CH I C K E N  + SW  E E T  PO T  A  T  O  HA S H\nP o a c h e d   E g g s    \n+   G r e e n   C h i l e  H o l l a n d a i s e  $18\n\nHusband went with:\n\nRA N C H   ST Y L E   EG G S   TO S T  A  D A\nC r i s p y   F l o u r   T o r t i l l a  \n  A n c h o   C  h  i l e   -   T  o m  a t  o   S a u c  e    \n+   W h i t e   C h e d d a r   C h e e s e  $16.\n\nWe were brought a basket of great baked goods that included adorable and delicious tiny jalapeno biscuits, Bobby's usual blue cornbread muffin (which always falls apart when try to eat it, but is more moist than it used to be) and a delicious blueberry baked something.  Husband's coffee was excellent!  \n\nAnd out came the entrees.  Both were HUGE.  If only Husband did poached eggs maybe we could've shared, but he doesn't so all I got was a taste of his, and he took a taste of mine then dove back into his.  Mine was really good, but Waiter had said it was the spiciest thing on the menu (6 out of 10 he said).  I had said bring on the spice.  I would give it maybe a 2 out of 10 on the spicy scale.  It was good, but would've loved a small amount of it along with something else.  It was too much of one thing.  Husband's dish that sounded so plain and ordinary was fabulous!  (at least the one bite I got).  In hindsight, I would recommend sharing a couple different things.  \n\nAm still a fan of Mesa Grill and would not hesitate to go back, but would order differently in the future. And sincerely hope they fix the peach problem!"

We had. 6:45pm reservation and were seated within minutes. Our service was initially pretty good and then went downhill along with some of the food. We ordered the 1st bottle of wine and wanted a few appetizers to go with it. The waiter stated we had to order wine, apps, and all of our entrees at the same time. I felt rushed and the waiter was irritated that we hadn't selected our entrees at this point. After ordering everything, we saw him maybe 2 more times in 2 hrs.... Even pouring our own wine from the bottle. Not that I have a problem with that but when your entree costs $50 usually the waiter keeps your glassed filled. \n\nFood rundown:\n\nApps:\nQueso Fundido was excellent with goat and Monterey jack cheeses $15\nTiger Prawn Tamale was just ok.... 3 or 4 shrimp total...  Not worth $17\nQuesdilla was awesome and worth the $12ish price\n\nEntrees and sides:\nMy sister had 2 app size chile  rellenos for her entree. There is a ente size chili relleno but the waiter said it was a big bell pepper?? Call me crazy but chili relleno is supposed to be made with a large chili?? At any rate the app size chili relleno was weird. First of all it looks like a large jalepeno popper sans the cheese. It was filled with dry black beans and came with a corn meal crust... No sauce.. No cheese. Mt sister requested cream fraiche on the side... With a smirk from the waiter.\n\n3 others in our party ordered the Tuna Steak entree. While tasty it requires a steak knife for the medium rare.. Again a complete smirk from our now very rude waiter.\n\nI had the Porterhouse Lamb chops. To be honest is is the only thing that is making me give Mesa Grill 2 stars. There were 2 huge chop cooked perfectly to med rare and tasted amazing! \n\nSides: all sides cost $8\nMashed Potatoes were good but very small and $8 for a single serving\nBrussels sprouts were tasty\nSaut\u00e9ed spinach was generously average\n\nMy overall experience was just ok... If the service had been par with the prices and for our celebration I might feel differently. Order the lamb and stay away from the app chili relleno.\n\n6 ppl with 5 entrees and 2 bottles of wine... $450.00 plus gratuity."

And the server was SO NICE to provide us with only our favorites the 2nd go around!! YUM....\n\nWe then got Bobby Flay's specialty, The prawns over a homemade corn tamale! LOVED it - we pretty much licked the plate clean!  If you get a chance - go on their website - they show how they make it and it's a MUST order when you come here...\n\nI also got their apple salad which because of it's simplicity was so tasty!  That dressing was perfect with the salad - can't recall what it was other than we basically inhaled the entire salad.  And I enjoyed it with my prickly pear tea! They gave me simple syrup so I can add the right amount of sweetness! Loved it!!\n\nHubby had their sweet potato hash and LOVED it.  Cooked perfectly - but because we ate so much bread - he could only eat one, so we brought the other back to our timeshare which luckily had a kitchen so we could heat it up and devour the next day and it was JUST as yummy!\n\nI had Egg over Taquillas.  Who knew such a simple dish could be SO GOOD! The egg was so light and fluffy - on top of cheese and they smeared a little seasoned black bean paste between the toasted crispy taquillas. Flavors and textures partying in my mouth!! I'm drooling now just thinking about this dish!  So simple and so delicious!\n\nWe were SO STUFFED - we definitely felt like we had to roll out of there - thank goodness in Vegas it's all about walking!  And the server was so nice - they gave me a \"to go\" cup for my prickly pear tea and topped it for me so I got to sip it as we walked around Vegas.  The servers are so personable and attentive - it was a nice welcoming feeling...  Will definitely come back - and maybe try lunch or dinner next time! \n\nThank you Bobby Flay!!

I'm not a huge fan of queso fundido.  I love cheese, but I just find QF to be too much cheese usually.  Somehow I got sucked up into the hype of the queso and out it came.  It was good.  It was the best QF I ever had.  It had goat cheese in it and peppers on top.  But in the end it was queso fundido and I tired of it before half of it was gone.\n\nI had the smoked shrimp tacos.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked.  The tacos were served with 3 salsas: avocado, mango and tomatillo.  I put all the salsas on my tacos and they tasted great together.\n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Well the queso thing, but that's my own fault.  Those shrimp tacos were 20 something bucks, for 6 shrimp, some slaw, 2 tortillas, and salsa.  I can get a whole meal of tacos that are just as good from a truck down the street for $7. The GF had a spiced pork tenderloin and ( I don't mean to toot my own horn, but... ) I have seriously made better pork tenderloin sandwiches at home from leftovers.  And the fries were limp and all bits and pieces.\n\nI really wanted to love Mesa Grill.  Mexican and Southwestern foods are my favorites.  But I just felt like it didn't live up to the hype.  Maybe I went in with my expectations way too high.  Fair enough, and again my fault.  But I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  I am going to stick with my neighborhood taqueria."

We were hooked from the first bite of the appetizers and the first sip of the margarita. \n\nOur waiter was friendly, informative and made great suggestions. \n\nWhen the bread basket comes to the table, go for the yellow & blue corn muffin. I am going to make these at home as soon as I find some blue corn meal.\n\nWe started with the Crispy Squash Blossoms and the Corn Soup. The yellow pepper sauce for the squash blossoms was spicy but taking a bite of everything together was a perfect harmony. The corn soup, which was a special, was heaven in a bowl. Blended to a smooth velvety consistency and was sweet with a smokey tomato salsa and a drizzle of chili oil.\n\nThe dinner portions were larger than I thought they'd be. The only problem this caused was that we still needed room for dessert. Our entrees, New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast and a side of Roasted Corn, looked like works art. The flavor combinations were amazing. There were three nice cuts of dark crusted tenderloin standing on the plate in a puddle of bourbon-ancho sauce and a drizzle of cilantro oil. What can I say about the duck except who new that carrot and habanero would work together. You can't go wrong with either of these dishes. My only complaint would be that I wish the tamales were warmer, but still enjoyed them. Put it this way, I'll be trying to make these at home too. We really didn't have room for the Roasted Corn but the slight smokey, buttery, cheesy, tanginess was worth it. \n\nLast but not least, the dessert. The Blackberry-Mango Crostada and Cafe con Leche Flan were both highly recommended by our waiter. I love blackberry and mango so this was a no-brainer and the vanilla-blackberry ice cream was the star of this dessert. I also love coffee and this was not your normal custard style flan. This was like eating a coffee mousse with a thin caramel sauce around it and vanilla whipped cream on top.\n\nI will be back."

This an extremely busy restaurant, we had 5:45 reservations, arrived at 5:30 and were not seated until 5:55 and overheard that they didn't have any tables open until 9:00 so be sure to get reservations! Our service was spotty, while the waiter was friendly and offered some good recommendations the table next to us that arrived after us received dessert when we got our main course (both tables were ordering similar items off of the RW menu).  I ordered the scallops for appetizer and they were cooked to perfection my boyfriend got the venison chili and it was very good though not something we would order again. For main course I went with the pork tenderloin and it did not disappoint, so moist and the sauce had the perfect amount of kick; boyfriend went with the spare ribs which were moist and a good sauce to accompany. Dessert was a bit lacking in my opinion; the caramel/chocolate pudding was fine but really just your average pudding. The coconut cake was very good, moist with a nice crunch from the toasted coconut, I don't traditionally like coconut but I thought it was good. All in all I would visit again, though I might not seek it out since it is pricey."

Just very good flavor that added to the steak without overpowering it.\n\nI've had real Japanease kobe served at other celebrety chef restaurants (Gordon Ramsey London, West Hollywood) and I'd prefer the steak at Mesa every time.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't my favorite.  You could see the casino sports room through the glass and it was a little loud.  The tables were close together and it was nearly impossible not to chat with the people sitting at the table beside you.

Let's not forget he's classical trained and because of that he's one of the few celebrity chefs in Food Network who gives great cooking tips. I went here because this was the only Michelin Star that he ever earned. This restaurant is no longer a Michelin Star. (Michelin no longer does star ratings on Las Vegas restaurants.) I've eaten at a number of Michelin Star restaurants, but I've eaten at restaurants that were at that time were Michelin Star rated but no longer has a star (Fleur de Lys and Alexander's Steakhouse). So eating here would provide me a good comparison to restaurants that are currently Michelin Star rated and those who were in the past.\n\nI ate here last night. The menu is straightforward a la carte unlike the trendy tasting menu. My server recommended the signature dish is the New Mexico Pork Tenderloin. He also said Mesa is known for their margaritas. I had two items that I plan to ordered. I always see Flay mentioning about blue corn. There were two blue corn items: 1) Blue Corn Pancake 2) Blue Corn Lobster Tacos.  At the suggestion of my server I ordered the lobster tacos.\n\nThe Mesa Grill Margarita arrived before any of my dishes. It was a refreshing drink to start with. The first dish was the lobster tacos. For $20 I was disappointed. There are 3 mini tacos in a blue corn shell. You can taste the spices and lobster however I couldn't taste the blue corn. I should have ordered the Blue Corn Pancake. The entree, which is the signature dish of Mesa Grill, New Mexico Pork Tenderloin was a tastier dish than the lobster tacos. This is one of the more underrated spiciest dishes I ever had. There are the medallions that are covered in spices. Eating this dish takes a while to finish. But in doing so you enjoy each pork medallion, which was moist and tender. I decided not to order dessert.\n\nSo what was the verdict? When I go a fine dining restaurant I want to learn what its cuisine is about. Mesa is supposed to be known for southwest flavors. However when I ate here last night I never understood what southwest flavors were. From other Michelin Star restaurants I've eaten I learned and understood what their cuisine was. Two prime examples are two restaurants in San Francisco: Boulevard and Aziza. When I ate at Boulevard I understood what California cuisine is. When I ate at Aziza I understood what Moroccan cuisine is. But to be fair to Mesa, in comparison to other former Michelin Star restaurants, Mesa is better than Fleur de Lys (San Francisco) but not as good as Alexander's Steakhouse (Cupertino). I think a 3-star rating in my book is fair.\n\nWill I eat at Mesa again? Maybe. However I regret not ordering the Blue Corn Pancake and Chile Relleno. If I did maybe rating would be different. Who knows in the future if Michelin would start rating Las Vegas restaurants?  If Michelin does I can't see Mesa garner its star back at the moment."

The service is great, as should be expected since we're grossly overpaying for it but the main course was barely edible for me.  \n\nSo the main course here comes basically by itself and starters and everything else is separate.  Sadly, the best part of the meal for me was the starter!  I ordered this shrimp tamale that was actually good.  For the main course, I had the filet mignon.  I ordered it medium rare and it came out basically straight off the cow.  It was just way too rare for my taste and it has this sauce on it that I did not like.  I only ate about half of it and left the rest.  I figure if you go to a restaurant with a celebrity chef, I should be coming out of the place wanting to write about it on Yelp! for good reasons.  \n\nMy disappointment in the meal alone renders this a 2 star place.

I made a point of making a reservation a few weeks before arriving to eat at Mesa Grill while there with some co-workers.  Plus, I'm a big fan of eating well when I can bill it back somewhere.  And boy did we bill a nice expensive 300 dollar 3 person meal.\n\nThe restaurant is a very fun festive atmosphere.  Its right in the middle of the casino.  If I had one non menu related criticism, it would be the location within the casino.  It's right next to the sports book and its a very hectic location.  Having said that, they do a good job isolating you from it once inside the restaurant.\n\nWe had dinner reservations so we were ordering from their dinner menu.  I personally had the venison entr\u00e9e.  Venison seems to be something you like or you absolutely avoid.  Others at the table voiced their lifelong dislike for the dish.  I honestly don't discriminate when it comes to meats, so I was all in.  The dish comes with the venison filleted into three pieces and then you get a garlic tamale as a side.  The venison was nothing like the gamy meats you often encounter when eating venison from backwoods hunting trips.  The fillet they served didn't have any more or less of a strong flavor than beef would have had.  The venison was topped with a smoky sauce to compliment the meat.  The garlic tamale was good, but it was a ho-hum side.  It wasn't terribly memorable.\n\nI also sampled the Jalape\u00f1o Pork Chops that another person dining with us had.  It was nice lean pork and the jalape\u00f1o flavor was great spicy addition to the flavor that really made it pop.   Its great to see a menu that wasn't scared to add some spice to the dishes.\n\nWe should have gotten one or two sides to share between the table.  There were others that were convinced we didn't need it.  I think that was a mistake in retrospect.  They're less than 10 dollars and would have complimented the smaller entr\u00e9e portions.\n\nIt was a great meal.  Its the type of meal I wouldn't seek to have all the time but once in a while when I'm in town for a convention its great to endulge.  I would like to sample the lunch menu next time I'm in town.  If you're really looking to spend some money on a great meal don't skip Mesa Grill."

The sweet BBQ and subtle but powerful heat to the sauce was fantastic on the perfectly cooked pork tenderloin - all went nicely with an ice cold margarita. The Tequila list was long and full of great options. \n\nService was very good."

We walked in around 7:00pm on a Friday night with no reservation, but we got two seats at the bar and the bar tender turned out to be a crack up. She told us some crazy stories and made great food recommendations. \n\nI was set on having the Crispy Squash Blossoms - and I was right - they were heaven. I seriously could have eaten ten more. Then hubby and I shared the Coffee Rubbed Fillet and Cilantro Mashed Potatoes. The fillet was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes were perfectly fluffy and the green cilantro pesto stuff was quite tasty. Believe me - I am a mashed potato connoisseur and these were up there with the best (meaning my homemaders)!  :)\n\nI will be back next time I'm in Vegas!!"

But come on with the money you spend here you can't bring out something small that's complimentary? It just makes it feel more like a celebration when they do that. The desserts didn't sound that great either. Probably wouldn't choose this for a special occasion dinner because of that.\n\nSERVICE (3.5 stars):\nOur waiter was nice, hard to find at times, and just really busy with all the other tables he was helping. Took long to get things we requested, or he'd forget and we had to remind him. \n\nI don't know if I'll be back here. The entrees were pretty good, well half of the lobster dish was good. Maybe I'll try appetizers more. But the overall experience was just bleh. And that bread...aye...make fresher bread! Or better bread if it was \"fresh\", bad first impression right when you sit down."

We decided on the blue corn duck pancake, the queso fundido, and shared the vegetarian chile relleno. The chips were delicious, as was the queso. My friend said the duck pancake was good. And our chile relleno was okaaaaaaaaay. It was definitely cheesy, and I appreciate the variation on the egg white batter with a corn meal one, but I was a bit disappointed in the texture - I'd describe it as merely \"hard\" rather than \"crunchy\", if you will. And the eggplant, which is a vegetable I love, was kinda lackluster in the mess of cheese inside. This whole dish could have used some brightening with some additional fresh salsa or something. We also shared the blueberry cheesecake, which was delicious but nothing special.\n\nKinda disappointed in the Flay, given how much of a pretentious A-hole he is, starring in all these \"so-I'm-the-shit-and-you-should-try-beat-me\" shows of his.

K owing how he creates recipes I was hopeful that the restaurant wasn't just successful due to his name, and I have to say that isn't the case. Coworkers at my table that have dined at all the great spots in Vegas said their steaks at Mesa were better. We had the blue pancake with BBQ duck, tiger shrimp tamale and crab cake for appetizer. All were outstanding. The duck was strongly seasons from the. BBQ sauce but not overpowering. The shrimp were perfect and the crab cakes meaty and cooked perfectly.  Most everyone orders a steak and all loved their selection. I had the chipotle glazed ribeye and it was amazing. Had a hint of sweetness and spice.  If you like horseradish, I recommend the double baked potato. Different, but fabulous. This was a meal I will always remember. Awesome job Bobby!  I've always wanted to try one of your establishments and was so happy that when I did it wasn't about celebrity, but about the obvious quality you've poured into MESA."

Thankfully he was right.\n\nThe steak came out in a reasonable time and was medium rare like I ordered it. It was definitely delicious, but not sure if it can justify $50 USD. It should at least come with a side or two at that price. The mash potatoes were an extra $10 USD and there really wasn't anything special about it. The mash potatoes were average at best. \n\nOverall the food was great, but it is definitely on the pricier end for me. But it is Vegas after all. Food speed and service was reasonable.

I confess that me and my friend were seduced by the star name on the name to make reservations here for dinner but although it artificially raises its prices because of a vague association to Bobby Flay its dishes retain the famous chef's signature style. Which basically means that they are slightly spicier and over-sauced than you'll probably find at home. \n\nPrice was MESA is \"spendy\" but not ridiculous like some of Caesar's other offerings (Ie. Homestead Steakhouse). The ambiance is trendy and upbeat;  I was actually surprised by how bright and colorful the decoration inside was. For dinner we had a decent bottle of burgundy for about $90-100 and: \nRough Cut Tuna Nachos ($16)\nLobster Tacos ($20)\nRoasted Veal Chop ($48)\nChile Crusted Rabbit ($38)\nCollard Greens and Sauteed Spinach ($9 each)\nThe whole dinner came to around  $300 but it would have been closer to $200 (with tax and tip) were it not for the bottle of wine. For me the highlight of the dinner was the Rabbit which is perfectly seasoned and prepared in 2 distinct styles. My friend enjoyed his entree and desert as well but we both found the side dishes disappointing. They were bland and the collard greens did not taste at all fresh. However the side dishes are unnecessary I think: the entrees all come with some vegetables and the serving of rabbit in particular is too big for one person. I could only get through 2/3 of it before surrendering. \n\nA final somewhat strange note: The hosts like to arrange the seating so that people who are dressed similarly are next to each other. This leads to the restaurant divided into several clusters: 1) filled with men in Hawaiian shirts and polos, 2) trendy ladies in cocktail dresses, 3) those dressed to impress and those elderly gentlemen with young trophy wives. In a way it's nice because no matter how you dress you shouldn't feel comfortable because the people around you will probably be dressed in a similar style."

As much as I love Bobby Flay and Southwestern food, I just wasn't impressed the first time; however, my boyfriend and I were looking for a nice dinner that didn't break the bank all while offering great food and cocktails, so we decided to give it another go (mostly because all of our other \"hot spots\" were closed before Christmas, but I digress).\n\nI will say they have excellent service. We had a wonderful waiter who was both polite and prompt. I started with the white peach margarita, which came out perfectly- slightly sweeter than the traditional but not so much that it's overboard. I had a terrible margarita before which really turned me off, but I think Mesa Grill redeemed itself on the cocktail part after this white peach one. As other reviewers have said, they have a nice complimentary bread basket that we both enjoyed. For my meal, I ordered Sophie's chopped salad and the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale (appetizer) and my boyfriend had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. The food is great, but my one quip is there is just not enough of it. I honestly felt like the appetizer portion was equal to the pork entr\u00e9e, which is kind of sad. It is really, really good, just sort of small. I'm not sure if it was just the pork dish or if all of the entr\u00e9es are like this, but it was a little off-putting. You should not order a meal and still feel hungry after eating, sorry.\n\nWith that said, I've actually recommended Mesa Grill to a few other people traveling to Las Vegas and they've all had great experiences. Perhaps it's me, but I just can't say it's my favorite place in a city full of so many ridiculously good restaurants."

I actually wanted to like this place & judging from the yelp reviews I thought..maybe it won't be so bad! Ugh..I was not impressed. For starters we ordered Sophie's Chopped Salad & the \"Queso Fundido.\" Sorry Sophie, but I think I could have made a better salad it was just a bunch of beans w/ pieces of lettuce & tortilla chips thrown in. The queso was served in a little skillet & was piping hot..but not in a good way more like it had been nuked in the microwave & had a layer of oil on top...no bueno. \n\nI wasn't really in the mood for meat so I ordered the Mango spice tuna steak..since I'm allergic to nuts I asked the server not to put pine nuts in the cous cous. I really didn't care too much for the tuna steak..it had way too many peppercorns. The bf had the grouper & didn't really care much for it either. I think the only thing I liked was the margarita I ordered. So yea when I think of Mesa grill, I think of a bourgeosie Chili's or Chevy's where you're likely to find mango chutney or ancho chile sauce on the menu & where you can expect to spend over $100 on sub par Tex Mex food."

Fresh, crispy tasting, and served with two really awesome sauces splayed beautifully across the plate.  Big winner appetizer here.\n\nRough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" - Can probably pass on this one.  Chunks of moderately bland/unseasoned raw tuna are served with about 20 absurdly tiny \"nacho\" dipping tortilla chips (think mini tostitos bite size rounds, with half of them blue corn and half regular)\n\nSixteen Spice Crusted Chicken - This was pretty delicious.  Tender, juicy, spices crisped on the skin... it was a very nice piece of poultry.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were also killer.\n\nMango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak - Yes its true they like mango and spices here.  This was by far the most delicious thing on the table.  The tuna was just overflowing with an awesome spice crusted exterior.  It was perfectly seared.  As you bite into it, you get that fantastic full tuna taste and texture at first.  Then the spices kick in a little more slowly, intensifying in flavor throughout the bite, with a real nice spicy punch in there at some point as well.  Wow this was an awesome piece of tuna.\n\nSomehow we got out of here for under $100 a person despite ordering entrees, appetizers, cocktails and wine.  Good times!"

The perfectly cooked shrimp with the sweetness of the corn mixed with the creaminess of the tamales and sauce was pure bliss to my taste buds. I almost wanted to order another for my entree. \n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno: Nice smoky flavor with a spicy kick to it. The cornmeal added a nice crust that contrasted well with the eggplant and gooey cheese inside. \n\nNew Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: Disappointing. The pork was tough, dry and lacked flavor. Nothing in it stood out and my husband only ate half of the sandwich. \n\nThere were some issues with the seating that tainted our overall experience. We brought it up to the management and they did their best to make it up to us. Unfortunate situation since I had high expectations for my first time eating here but the food speaks for itself and the majority of what we ordered were unique and flavorful."

After a late lunch last Saturday with my adult son, we decided to return today and were not disappointed.\nThe food is prepared well, with seasonings that do not overtake the food but compliment it. The presentation is perfect, as some of the pictures on this site try to depict. \n  Fresh and delicious specialty bread items were brought to the table, including a jalape\u00f1o corn muffin, small sweet muffin, and a blueberry type bread in small amounts for each person. Perfect.\n  An appetizer of smoked salmon quesadilla was shared and enjoyed immensely. The light touch of fresh dill creme Fraiche added a contrast to the smoky salmon and restrained use of cheese so that all flavors were both full yet balanced.\n  Sweet Potato Clam Chowder was absolutely the best use of sweet potatoes in a soup that I have had, and I've tried many.\n  The Tiger Shrimp / Roasted Corn Tamale had a delicious cilantro sauce with 4 tender perfectly cooked shrimp.  Once again the flavors were well balanced.\n  Spicy Chicken/ Sweet potato hash molded into cups each held a poached egg with Green Chile Hollandaise and a side of grits, was said to be delicious (not mine and no tastes?)\n  Service is polite, attentive, helpful, and had an eye on the table, which allowed water to be refreshed before the glass was emptied, plates to be cleared, and after bites of the food were enjoyed, a check on our satisfaction followed. We were informed of specials, asked if we wanted alcoholic drinks, dessert/coffee, but not pushed.\n  The entire restaurant (dining area, restroom, entry area) is beautifully designed in burnished and hammered copper, stone, and lighting elements that attracted my artistic eye. Music was at a low level so that a conversation was possible, yet if quietly savoring the flavors, it was a gentle presence.\n   I will be returning on my next visit to my son in the Vegas Area."

Well, some vows are made to be broken. \n\nEverything we ordered this time around was mighty tasty. \n- The blue corn muffins were the stars of the bread basket, although they were a little crumbly. \n- The goat cheese queso fundido had a subtle tartness that went well with the green and red peppers of the dish.\n- Cheese quesadilla. It was just a quesadilla, but it was one of the best I've had.\n- Rough cut tuna nachos. Fresh, delicious, and a touch of spiciness.\n- Crispy squash blossoms. Deep fried (think tempura) with a tangy, yummy sauce. Loved it.\n- New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. It was indeed tender. And hot. I just wished it had more of that bourbon ancho chile sauce. But it was so delicious that it just re-affirmed my love for all-things-pig related (maybe I need to get a tattoo of a pig like that one Top Chef contestant).\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is casual.

Mesa Grill is easy to find in it's central location in the middle of the casino and with it's vibrant colors pouring out. \n\nThe staff was very professional and friendly. We were seated almost instantly and took in the surroundings - very eclectic and energetic decor. Opening the menu, there is a lot to choose from. I myself ordered the duck with the chile rilleno on the side, and the man decided to try the halibut with a side of mashed potatoes. And, of course - there were Margaritas. We just ordered the classic version on the rocks...\n\n...I can't rave enough about them. DELICIOUS! I could have had about 5 more. However, being in Vegas, one has to pace themselves. \n\nAfter a scrumptious bread bowl, the food came. Presentation was fantastic, and the taste even better.  My duck was some of the best I've ever had - savory, spicy, juicy. The homemade tamale on the side was delish and the chile rilleno - I died. ORDER THIS EXACT MEAL. \n\nAll in all - ambiance was A+.

This place is my favorite of all of them. I actually ate at the one in the Bahamas first which was a 5/5 and recently I had eaten at the one in Vegas which was almost as good so I had to balance it out with a 4. Let me start by saying the decor in this place is beautiful. I think Mr. Flay and I are cut from similar modes because I like not only his food, but his personality and tastes. The lighting is warm and ambient and I almost like everything but the flames on the walls. That's the only thing that is somewhat corny to me. Everything else I'm all about. \n\nLets just get right to it. The food. Outstanding. I mean really the amount of thought that goes into the dishes and how ingredients play off each other is mind blowing. I started off with the blue corn pancake with Barbecued duck. Now I have said this quite a few times but if you know me you know if you can get my tear ducts going you have something special in front of me. When I say I've never teared this much from I truly mean it. This was one of the most tasty, delicious things I have ever eaten. Cooked to absolute perfection I ate this appetizer for about 10 min. I really wanted to taste every ounce of this dish. The sauces were phenomenal. \n\nMy main course was the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale and almond butter. Man, what a dish. That tamale was freaking heaven. I couldn't get enough of it. The pork was cooked so tender i could cut it with my fork. Just a great job.

Tables were very crowded together and wait staff and other guests continually bumped into our chairs - very annoying.\n\nDesign of restaurant was interesting - with glass wall facing the casino floor - casino noise did not infiltrate restaurant.\n\nHad drinks and food at their Sunday brunch - I had an eggs benedict type item, with a blue corn base and crab - lukewarm in temperature and unremarkable in taste/texture.  Food of other guests was equally unremarkable.\n\nAs this was Sunday brunch, we sat at around noon and visited with our guest until about 1:30-2:00pm (not unreasonable in my opinion for brunch) - they were clearly shutting down for brunch service and setting up for dinner service, we wound up finished out meal while they were turning the restaurant over for dinner.

            "review": "LVRW2012: My preconceptions of Mesa being 'over-rated' have been squashed. My love for Anthony Bourdain turned me into an Flay-hater for no reason. Everyone has seen that episode of No Reservations--yes? Well, sorry for all the mean words Bobby. I'm the newest fan of Mesa Grill!\n\nFIRST: The Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is a signature Bobby Flay dish. I think my server saw me drool a little. I tried to be casual as I scraped every last bit of sweet masa from the corn husk and scooped up every last bit of that buttery sauce. This is the tamale of my dreams.\n\nSECOND: This is the way a Green Chile burger is supposed to taste: juicy and flavorful. The burger was cooked exactly to my specifications and had the most wonderful flavor. It was huge and a little difficult to eat. But I made it work. Little to no heat, but more sweet and savory which was definitely up my alley.\n\nDESSERT: If you've ever eaten a spoon full of shaving cream, you'll know how the key lime sorbet tasted. Not that I regularly eat shaving cream, but every time I took the spoon to my mouth that's all I could think about. The fruit compote spiked with chili was not my cup of tea. I'll be direct and say it was awful. I would've traded this for another tamale.\n\nI downed a few of those White Peach Bellinis, but I stopped at 3 to avoid looking like a drunk at 11:30am on a Sunday. Adds up at $12 a glass, but quite refreshing. My server was polite, formal, and attentive. CELEBRITY DOPPELGANGER: he looked just like Robert Irvine from Dinner: Impossible!\n\nThe savory dishes were a positive slap in the face. Bobby Flay has some swag in the kitchen and Mesa serves up some good food. Just know that dessert can be purchased at CVS for about $2 a can.... *kidding* *not really*"

            "review": "In the early days of Food Network, I held an inexplicable grudge against Bobby Flay.  His only show at the time was the original Grillin and Chillin where he was partnered up with a bona fide hick in overalls.  Then Bobby caused all sorts of hullaballoo by standing on his cutting board.  Over time, I slowly began to accept that he really was not so bad as a personality and possibly even good as a chef.  So personality differences aside, I made a brunch reservation for Mesa Grill on my most recent visit to Las Vegas.  \n\nThe bread basket made an immediate impact.  It contained two types: a jalapeno cheddar bread and a corn muffin.  The jalapeno cheddar bread was not at all a wallflower.  It packed a really spicy kick from the peppers and a salty crust from the cheese.  The corn bread was soft and airy and could barely be buttered.   \n\nWe ordered two appetizers, one of which was the rough cut tuna nachos.  I was ready to dismiss this altogether because everyone knows rough cut tuna nachos means Mexicanafied tuna tartar.  Well, yes, but it was such a different and delicious dish that I would not make such lame generalizations again.  The blue corn chips were freshly fried and incredibly crisp.  The tuna was not a dice/mash of tuna odds and ends but beautiful jeweled cubes of red tuna.  It seemed to be the perfect compliment to the cool avocado crema and the spicy mango habanero hot sauce.  When we ordered this our server went out of his way to warn us that the tuna was going to be served raw.  This is Vegas after all and how horrifying might it be for someone to expect canned tuna on tortilla chips and get this beautiful thing instead? \n\nThe next appetizer was equally delicious and one that most people rave about.  A moist tamal has been covered with sauteed tiger shrimp and a garlic cream sauce.   It was a nice change of pace to dip the tender shrimp and masa into the velvety sauce.  \n\nFor his entree, John ordered the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloin sandwich grilled red onion, arugula, ancho chili mayo and spicy fries.  This was a perfectly good sandwich but not as memorable as the other things we tried.  The pork was room temperature and I would have much preferred it hot and freshly sliced.  \n\nThe only dish I might not get again was my own.  I grew up eating homemade chile rellenos and this version was little too clean and precise.  The chile was very neatly and uniformly coated in a cornmeal crust and stuffed with manchego and roasted eggplant.  The cornmeal was crisp but too thick and I much prefer queso fresco to the much more pungent taste of the goat's milk manchego. I did however, like the sweet and sour combination of the red pepper and balsamic vinegar sauces. \n\nI must give Senor Flay some credit.  It was a really good meal and he really has a way with flavors and sauces.  He didn't shy away from authentic ingredients and a good amount of heat.  We easily classified it as one of our better meals of the trip."

I've had a mix of both hits & misses here and thankfully this visit was a hit.\n\nThis was a quick visit between my bar hopping and other eats this Vegas trip. I told myself I had to stop in here since it's been a year or so since I last visited and I did just for an appetizer. If there's anything I truly enjoyed from my previous visit, it was the sweet potato tamale that came with my pork tenderloin which prompted me to try the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic tamale this time around.\n\nThis tamale was very flavorful...a perfect blend of sweet corn and garlic. The tiger shrimp were a nice size as well as delicious. $18 well spent for a quick snack and worth it.\n\nIf there's one thing I can say about Mr. Flay, he knows how to make some damn good tamales with any spin he throws on them. My taste buds love it which means this will most likely draw me back in for another visit.\n\nSnack 12/12/2015"

The mango carrot (I believe that was the mixture - could have been orange carrot) juice was Delicious! Totally fresh.\n\nTo start, we shared the Queso Fundido. So indulgent! Yummy! If you like goat cheese, you will love this plate of bubbly-deliciousness. Next, I got the Chilaquilas. They were pretty spot on. The flavors were bold and deep - and all tied together well. We all loved our experience.\n\nGo Bobby!"

The chopped salad was tasty though I could've done without the large cubes of cheese.  I didn't try the chicken but guests who ordered it said it was very good.  The pork tenderloin was juicy and flavorful.  The rub was not so spicy (for me) and paired with the sweet potato tamale made it a perfect combination.  The coconut cake was moist and just the right amount of sweet.  \n\nJames, our server, was wonderfully attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nSide note...get the sweet potato clam chowder, too...even if you don't necessarily care for clams like me.

For starter were shared the shrimp tamale--which was to die for.  Should have ordered two--so very good.  Each entree came with a tamale with pecans, and it was unbelievably good.\n\nI was so impressed we returned for brunch.  I was not so impressed, and was actually disappointed with my dish.  I had scrambled egg chilaquiles.  I did not like the flavor of the sauces at all, and had really expected something great.  Would not recommend at all.  They were more like deconstructed chilaquiles.  My husband, on the other hand, ordered two appetizers.  He had the shrimp tamale--which was every bit as good as before, and the bacon and egg quesadilla, which again was superb.   \n\nService was goo, and the bread baskets on both trips were very good.

Our main course was the Chile Rellano and Pork Tenderloin with a side of mashed potatoes. \n\nThe Pork Tenderloin was served with an ancho chile sauce that was hot and topped with a pecan butter sauce and plated with a sweet potato tamale.

I don't really like eggplant but paired up with a chile and manchego cheese and a superb cornmeal crust; I was in heaven.\n\nThe mashed potato side was topped with a green chile queso sauce that was absolutely mouth watering.

And because we're in Vegas, we know we have an impressive selection to choose from. But regardless of all of the other 5 star grills and restaurants boasting the greatest menus in town, we find our hearts set on Bobby Flay's place and have to pay it a visit. \nI wasn't sure what to expect out of Mesa Grill, but I was totally in love with everything about this place. The style - a relaxed yet elegant and modern space with warm lighting and beautiful d\u00e9cor - exactly what I'd imagine coming from a restaurant that Bobby Flay has anything to do with. \nWe were seated right away in a cozy booth toward the back of the restaurant, giving us ample opportunity to people watch and enjoy each others company on our first big vacation with just the three of us. \nOur service was great, albeit a bit slow. But, to be fair, it was a bit of a busy night and we were seated in a section with a couple of larger groups, so I can excuse the wait times for refills and for our checks. But hopefully, next time everything will be a little bit more prompt - I'd love to give that last star - I know this place deserves it. \nNow for the main event - the food. \nLet me start off by saying that if I had been in pretty much any other restaurant and seen a steak that was over a pound, I would have rolled my eyes and moved right on down the menu in search of something a less ridiculous. But, because I all three of us were going all out, I just went with it. The description of the Chipoltle Glazed Rib Eye was too enticing - despite the fact that this monster was 22 ounces of beefy goodness. I don't have words for how amazing this cut of cow was. Cooked to a PERFECT medium rare (what else would you expect from a place like this?), I probably ate an impressive three quarters of it. I just couldn't stop. Do yourself a favor and fast for a majority of the day to eat this whole thing, because trust me - it's worth every last, heavenly bite. The side of cilantro pesto mashed potatoes that I ordered, however, was not forgotten. I nearly finished all of those, too. \nOf course, by the end of our entrees we had absolutely NO room for desserts. We'll just have to wait for next to delve into that mess - I mean, banana cream pie? Churros? Man. Looking back in retrospect - maybe we should have done it anyway."

I'd also heard good things about their margaritas.\n\nThe restaurants sits right up against the casino floor in Caesar's.  The atmosphere inside was okay, but I still felt very aware that I was in a casino.  The bread was really delicious - in particular I was a big fan of the spicy southwest cornbread.  The service was also good - our water glasses didn't remain empty for long.\n\nThe margarita list was shorter than I expected.  There were only a few specialty margaritas listed.  I asked the server if they could make any spicy margaritas, and she said she'd bring out some chopped serranos that I could put in a standard margarita.  It was tasty, and I appreciated her accommodating my request, but I was a bit disappointed they couldn't do something a little fancier than giving me a side of peppers to spice up my margarita given that margaritas are supposedly one of their specialties.\n\nI started off with the black bean soup, and boyfriend had the lobster tacos.  He was a huge fan of his tacos, and I'd give my soup a thumbs-up (though I think it may be hard to really mess up black bean soup).   For our mains, he had the swordfish, and I had the scallops.  This is where we were kind of disappointed.  While the accompanying sauces were delicious (mine came with some wild mushroom grits that were awesome), the scallops and swordfish were both overcooked.  They ended up being kind of tough and rubbery.  Kind of a shame because if they had been properly cooked I think we would've had a 4 star experience.  But, given that both of our entrees were overcooked, and we didn't arrive at a busy time, I have to demote to 3 stars."

The interior of the restaurant is quite nice, but the atmosphere is a bit too casual for the prices it carries.\n\nWe ordered the Tiger Shrimp with garlic corn tamale and Pan Seared Squid for appetizers. Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. The sauces are a tad too sweet. The tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm the maiz. The squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy.\n\nI had the veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved the sauce - a little sweet like the other dishes, but the subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. The wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet.\n\nOthers in my party had the rib eye and the filet, both of which I sampled and found the sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste the meat. But my friends loved their dishes.\n\nDouble baked potatoes - delicious! Again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them. But that's my palate, and I'm sure some people like the sweet taste more than spicy.\n\nOur waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty.\nBetween the 4 of us, the bill was $300 including tax & tip, with no drinks or dessert. It was a tasty meal and we enjoyed the restaurant. But some of us were still hungry after the meal -- we could do with more filler food."

I got the meat medium rare (first time ever being asked for cooking option for pork).  It was PERFECTLY cooked.  The meat was soft and juicy and the rub had a very nice spicy kick to it.  Dip each piece into the Ancho Chile Sauce and you won't do anything else but smile with your eyes closed.  The plate comes with 3 tenderloin pieces (more like logs).  While they look small, they really do fill you up.  I couldn't finish the entire meal and ended up taking one piece home.  I heated it up in the microwave the next morning and actually ate it for breakfast the next day and it was STILL delicious.  I was extremely impressed since typically when you reheat meat in a microwave it will come out overcooked and dry, but not this tenderloin.  This is definitely a MUST TRY!!!"

So, when I was it was the first thing I did! \n\nWhat I got:\nTiger shrimp tamale\nHoney glazed salmon\nSixteen spice chicken\n\nThe place itself is very nice, obviously you know it's in Cesar's palace. The staff is very friendly and our serve was friendly and very helpful as well. They give you a bread basket when you first sit down and bread has some peppers and jalape\u00f1os in it. I personally, didn't really enjoy it. It tasted more like corn bread, which I'm not a fan of. We stared off with the tiger shrimp tamale, it was good, but not great to me. The shrimp and the sauce were very tasty. Then the entrees came out. My dish the sixteen spice chicken was uhhhh-amazing. The chicken was so tender and juicy! I'm drooling just thinking about it now. I love how the mango sauce had a little kick to it. The mash potatoes were also delicious. Honestly, probably one of the best dishes I've ever had to date. The second entree dish the honey glazed salmon, I don't really enjoy salon that much it was pretty darn good. It was crispy on the out and moist and juicy on the inside. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back! Must try."

Gah, I am still salivating over this meal and it's been 4 days!\n\nWe love us some Bobby Flay, so naturally we would choose to spend one of our two nights at Mesa Grill.  It was our first time, and we were very excited.  Mesa did not disappoint!\n\nWe had 7 pm reservations but headed to Caesars early to get drinks somewhere.  We ended up at Mesa early, and they were able to seat us right away. Perfect, cuz we were hungry!  We had a table in the back that was tiny and super close to our neighbors, but after the overall food experience, that didn't matter.\n\nWe started with cocktails which were tasty.  I tried the grapefruit vodka drink and my hubby had the one with Hendricks and cucumbers.  I am a vodka lover, but we both agreed his was amazing and tastier than mine.  We ordered 2 starters - the tiger prawn tamale and the smoked chicken quesadilla.  The tamale was out of this world!  I could eat that sauce on basically anything...so good!  The shrimp were delicious and the tamale was sweet with big corn kernels throughout.  If you go, you MUST get this.\n\nA bread basket came with an amazing corn muffin (but only one...which was sad, haha), some jalapeno cheese bread and a raisin walnut bread.  Not sure why the 3rd one was there, but my hubby liked it.  \n\nWe ordered a second round of drinks, and this is where one star comes off.   The waiter touted a certain margarita, but my hubby wanted the create-your-own style with his favorite tequila.  The waiter then said, \"sir, if I may, you really need to get this one.  It's so smooth...\" and bla bla bla, so he did, but asked for it on the rocks instead of up.  It came, up.  So we asked again for it on the rocks, and it came, but was only ok.  My hubby wished the server would have just let him order what he wanted.   \n\nFor our entree, we shared the seared scallops and they were heavenly.  They were so crisp on the outside, well seasoned and perfectly done.  The grits it came with were amazing too.  Definitely recommend!\n\nDessert was the toasted coconut cake and I honestly don't know if I've ever had cake that good in my life!  So moist, and so coconutty!  What I wouldn't give for another slice...\n\nThe ambiance is a little casual for the price point, but still nice.  Our server was attentive but the pushiness about that marg was off-putting.  Sometimes you just have to let the customer order what they want.  All in all, this was the best food we had in Vegas and we will be back!"

Fortunately, the food here at Mesa was such an explosion of flavor that I was able to clear both my nostrils.

Our Waiter was so knowledgeable about the food he offered nuggets of advice through out the ordering process.

They are letting people give a reservation for a table and then have a seat at the bar.\n\nSo I walk up and they tell me just a minute.  It is like panic-mode or something because one person is like \"seat everyone\" and then another person comes and is like \"don't seat anyone until 5pm!\" and there is just madness going on behind the counter where you place your reservations.\n\nFinally, someone looked up at me and asked if they could help me.  I asked for a table of one.  They said they could seat me at 5:15pm.  WHAT?!  It's 5pm and there are PLENTY of tables that no one is at.  I am ONE PERSON!  I was a little confused.  So I just stood & waited.  Truthfully, I was a little pissed.  But, within 5 minutes I was sat at a table.\n\nI sat for about 5 minutes when finally a waitress, that had been just standing over to the side, talking to another waiter, decided to come over and ask what I wanted to drink.  I only wanted water.  So a couple minutes later, water comes to the table.  I asked her a couple of questions and ordered the Sophie Chopped Salad.  \n\nThe Sophie Chopped Salad- kidney beans, garbanzo peas, lettuce, olives, chunks of cheese, little blue & white tortilla pieces and a yummy dressing.  I would totally order this again!!\n\nAfter I placed the order, about 3 minutes later some bread was brought to the table.  There were 3 pieces of bread- a blue corn muffin, a habanero bread and a cranberry (tasted a little sweeter) bread. Then immediately, my salad came to the table.  \n\nThe salad was DELICIOUS!  OMG!  I really want to go back and get it again!  I loved every inch of it!  The bread was divine too!  My bill came to just under $13.  Awesome!\n\nIt was just a little strange how almost all of the servers were standing around talking, a few of them bitching to each other and the madness that was behind the reservation stand.  Totally turned me off.\n\nI would go back to get that salad for sure!  But maybe not at that time again!"

We were a bit early for our reservation, so we grabbed a seat at the bar to wait.  The decor is awesome, and definitley captures the essence of the restaurant.  Everything is decked out in yellow, blue, red and green and has a very southwestern flair. I started off with the Cactus Pear Margarita, which had a nice zing and wasn't too sweet. \n\nWe were starving and very excited to eat.  The complimentary breads and butter were good, but I didn't indulge because I wanted to save room for the real food.  Thanks to our waiters (and yelpers) recommendations, we started off with the garlic shrimp tamale...I swear it kept getting better with each bite.  I normally don't like tamales (not a big corn fan) but this was AMAZING.  I probably could have had it as my meal, it was so filling.  I was pleasantly surprised to find they didn't skimp on the shrimp, and the sauce was so wonderful, I drenched each and every bite of my tamale in it.  We also had the black bean and chicken quesadilla.  It was great, with lots of chicken and guacamole and cooked perfectly...not too soggy and not too crisp.  \n\nAt this point we were already full, but we weren't about to pass up an entree so we decided to share the pork tenderloins and the pesto mashed potatoes.  OH MY GOD...the pork was tender and juicy, and the cut was just perfect.  The sauce complimented it well, a mixture of sweet and spicy.  And the pesto mashed potatoes?  Well, let's just say...WHY DIDN\"T I THINK OF THAT!!  They were creamy and flavorful, and although we thought we were about to burst, we ate every last bite.  Too bad we didn't save room for dessert, but we will be back!!!!"

The hostess was unattractive, and had quite an attitude.  \n\nIf you have never been to a Flay restaurant, I suggest you give it a go when you come to vegas, but if you're looking for mind blowing food- and something to write home to, this is not it."

We were extremely excited to go to one of your restaurants for the first time but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.\n\nWe went for lunch and I had the barbecued ribs for an app. They tasted like something you'd find at a school's cafeteria lunch. They looked like they had been sitting under a warming light for a few hours to add insult to industry.\n\nNext up were the \"smoked shrimp tacos.\" I wasn't aware smoked means charred/burnt. They lacked any remnant of palatable flavor. The two tortillas were quite generous of you.   \n\nThe service was just as horrendous. The waiter pretty much never came by and I cleared off the table myself to make way for the food.\n\nLastly, another reviewer had it right about the location inside the casino. You're sitting right by the sports betting so you can hear people screaming and cheering every now again. The biggest issue for me was the cigarette smoke. It wafts in from the casino floor and make the eating experience that much more gross.\n\nSuggestion: go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant instead. Maybe Iron Chef's just shouldn't have restaurants and stick to the Food Channel."

I like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. These offerings were too cold to enjoy. \n\nAppetizers: got the romaine salad, gala apple salad, and the tiger shrimp tamale. I could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. The tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... And the salads left much to be desired. The romaine salad lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. The apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling. \n\nMain course: definitely get the lamb chops or the glazed salmon. Both were perfectly cooked and I licked my plates clean. Delish!! However, skip the collard greens. They weren't worth the stomach room. But the table next to ours were raving about the Brussels sprouts, so I wish I gave those a try. \n\nDessert: you can not leave the Mesa Grill without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding. When i took my first bite the clouds parted, angels were singing, and all the stars aligned. This dessert will go down in the books! Yum, yum! \n\nBottom line: it was a good date night.

Walking around the hotel on Sunday early doesn't give you many choices and we blindly stumbled into Mesa Grill (didn't even check Yelp reviews). \n\nWe were seated fast and taken care of from the second we sat down. Sadly the brunch menu didn't have the dish I was craving (their version of a Cuban) but I found up trying this southwestern steak sandwich item that was top notch. I special ordered a side of grits and they were to die for. I ended up ordering another side of them because I couldn't deal without more of that. Properly made grits west of the Mississippi is pretty amazing in itself. \n\nThe price was a tad steep for what I received which led to the 4 star instead of 5 but it is Vegas and we were at Caesar's so it is to be expected. I just think it notched the place a little back to reality for me."

I however ordered the most fabulous thing on the menu, the Pork Tenderloin.  It was spicy and the sauces were perfect, the meat juicy and cooked just right.  The tamale that came with my dish was a sweet potato.  I don't like sweet potato so they gave me a jalapeno one instead, and this was also great.  For dessert we shared a banana cream pie.  It was delicious as well, sweet but not too sweet.  The restaurant itself is large and you can somewhat watch the kitchen.  The grilling area is right out front for people to watch and as we left we heard the cooks asking someone watching them if they had any questions.  I thought that was great that they encouraged people to ask about what they were doing.  This entire experience was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The pork tenderloin was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Not kidding."

We did and the cancellation policy states that if you don't cancel by the time they say, you will be charged. Well, that time that was associated was the day before! WTH?! Yup, if we didn't cancel the reservation over 24 hours before we made it, we'd get charged. Go figure. Warning, you do have to leave a credit card to make a reservation.\n\nI talked with the manager and he said the cancellation policy was not so. Well, I showed him i-Phone shots of our reservation (which I did NOT make) and he was astounded. He said he'd look into it.\n\nAnyway, without a reservation, we got a table for two immediately, just before a convention let out across the hall and the restaurant flooded with people. Beware this point. I don't know how you would check, but if a convention is in residence and a seminar lets out, it's going to be tough to get seated.\n\nSo, onto the food. \n\n1st, the margarita. WOW!...just WOW! outstanding! Beautifully done and tasted great. In fact, I could go for one right now! :)\n\nNext, the MESA BURGER * Double Cheddar Cheese\nGrilled Vidalia Onion + Horseradish Mustard served with Southwestern Fries. It, too, was great. A definite keeper and something I'd go back for again. The meals around us looked equally delicious (my wife is a particular fan of meal stalking others, afraid she might miss the better dish).\n\nLastly, before we got out meal, we were served with beautifully baked bread and spicy corn muffins. A real treat.\n\nSo, the downfall? Well, it's extremely noisy since it's open to the casino and you can smell the cigarette smoke lingering.\n\nAll in all, a great burger is what we came for and that was what we got....with a bonus superb margarita and bread.

So I called to move the reservation to 10:30pm and they were very helpful. I was really grateful that it wasn't an issue.\n\nWe were a little early and had to wait a few minutes for a table. No big deal since like I said, we were a bit early, but the hostess was just sort of unfriendly. Like you could tell she really didn't like her job all that much.\n\nWe were finally seated and placed our orders. We both had the Lamb Chops, which were served with a cranberry sauce along with a pumpkin tamale. The lamb chops were amazing. Perfectly cooked, HUGE and flavorful. The boy also loved the tamale - me notsomuch. I thought it was dry and overwhelmingly flavored with cinnamon. I thought it could have been much more subtle.\n\nThe service was good, but did lag a couple of times. Drink orders were forgotten and we had to flag our server down to get our check. But she was incredibly friendly and didn't seem to mind that we weren't going to order 3 courses and just wanted to get in and out.\n\nI give Mesa +3 for wonderful service and making my life much less stressful when I needed to move my reservations. +1 for a really excellent Lamb Chop and for living up to (at least) my boyfriend's expectations. -1 for being a little overpriced, but it is Vegas, so I should probably expect it.\n\nWould I go back to Mesa on another trip? Probably not. There are way too many awesome restaurants to try. Am I glad I tried it once? Hell yeah!"

Was debating giving 2 stars because they threw out the bill after the second mess-up, the drinks were strong and the appetizer (blue corn pancake with duck) was tasty. Still, there's no excuse for a dinner that would be in the $100 range to be completely inedible. Was the first time in my life a restaurant failed so badly they threw out the bill.\n\nWe went last week and started with a Partida Margarita and prickly pear one. Both drinks were pretty good, very strong. Definitely didn't taste like typical mix. Pear one was a very pretty purple and came in a decent-sized glass, the Partida came in a thinner margarita glass.\n\nThey switched waiters on us like four times throughout the dinner, which was fine because it meant the service was always prompt.\n\nThe blue corn pancake with duck was delicious, but they do stress how small it is. Imagine a thin, crispy crepe about the size of your palm, filled with shredded duck meat. Still, it had a rich but not overwhelming sauce, and was cooked to be tender and flaky. Very well prepared.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the mango chicken with some pesto mashed potatoes, and my girlfriend ordered a tuna steak done medium-well with, I believe, a risotto. \n\nFor the tuna steak, it was a hearty chunk on top of the risotto. The risotto was rather tasty. The steak, however, was overcooked and completely dry and gray inside. We called the waiter and he immediately agreed it was way overcooked from a glance. He took it back for us, saying he would ask them to cook it Medium instead of Medium-well, in hopes that maybe it would be just right.\n\nThe chicken came served with the potatoes and two good-sized chicken breasts, it actually looked really good, and the couple next to us commented on it. It was completely dry, though. I couldn't really taste the sauce. It was blackened, and tasted very much so. The \"mango\" sauce was mostly sticky-sweet sauce with a tiny dash of spice. It could as well have been store-bought stir fry sauce. Between the two of us, we ate half of one breast while we waited for her dish to come out, and by then I was growing kind of unhappy as I realized we just ate the juiciest part and it was only getting drier the further we went, and the taste of the charred bits was becoming the most overpowering flavor.\n\nI gave the potatoes a shot, but they were very boring and pretty uncomplimentary to the chicken.I munched on them while we waited for her steak to finish. The potatoes themselves were plain, and the pesto drizzled in was... essentially just olive oil with some basil in it. The sauce was very runny, didn't taste like nutty, and I couldn't see any grains to it. Overall, it tasted like mashed potatoes with oil-drenched basil in it.\n\nHer steak came back and it was now undercooked. It was so wet and blubbery she struggled to cut through it, and it kept sliding around on the plate. ANOTHER waiter (not our own) actually walked by as she was cutting it open, and made a face at it, asking if we would like it to be cooked a bit more before we even asked. Meaning it was probably not even cooked through. \n\nShe gave him the plate but at that point we were so disgusted we just asked our waiter to bring our check. I rejected a box, and he inquired why, so I explained that I didn't like my dish.\n\nA moment later, JP, the manager walked by and apologized to us, letting us know there wouldn't be a bill. He asked for any comments, and we explained to him that both the appetizers and drinks were delicious, but the entrees were inedible. He offered us free drinks \"to go\" but we declined them.\n\nLeft very upset."

I ordered an Anaheim chili relleno on the side that I was happy with as well.  Margaritas were good.  For dessert I had a chocolate cajeta cake.  It was a bit much for me.

This year we came during lunch and I ordered the lamb cobb salad, and my colleague got the shrimp tacos. \n\nFirst of all, the service is great. The waiters are friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about their dishes. Secondly, the bread. I usually try to avoid bread but this is not the place to do that. They give you jalapeno corn muffins, some sort of sweet bread, and a white bread. It's awesome. Third, the food. $18 may seem like a lot for a cobb salad but it is very worth it. They did not skimp of any of the toppings and it was fresh and filling. Fourthly, I think the couple sitting next to me was breaking up or in a fight because they both ordered the huge and delicious looking burgers, didn't take any bites, and didn't get a to-go box. It was very sad, not because they were breaking up but because those burgers deserved to be eaten."

I liked watching the chefs in action cooking our food that was like free entertainment.  I had the pumpkin soup sorry can't recall the exact name it was smokey and creamy.  The only thing I did not like about it was that it was kind of on the sweet side but that's just me and my palate. It looked beautiful and they didn't skimp either.  I loved loved loved the Ancho salmon it was cooked perfect nice and flaky.  My hubby had the pork sandwich and all he could say was wow this is really good.  We also tried the goat fundio which was the perfect balance of goat and another cheese.  Goat cheese for me can be a bit overpowering so they got the balance just right. My one and only complaint was that our table was just too small to fit all our food and drinks. Hehe I can't wait to go back and try other things.  I was looking at the table next to us and they ordered the shrimp tamales those smelled delicious. Yes my husband is embarrassed of me when I look at other people's food but I can't help it."

Also enjoyed the Ancho Chili Salmon $32, but would prefer wild salmon over Atlantic.  The fish seemed a little oily and although the sauces made it pop, I wouldn't order it again.  The Fundido Goat Cheese dip $16 was hard to scoop, it had hardened in the iron dish and I question whether it was actual goat cheese or a blend.  The chips were chips.  The Mesa margaritas $14 each were very tart, but fresh tasting and generous with the Tequila. The woman at the bar was not as friendly as the floor staff, but she may just have been having a bad day.  Hopefully the tip we left her cheered her up.  It is a fabulous restaurant offering top notch entrees and drinks.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu the next time we are in Vegas."

But what was SUPERB this night was the SERVICE!  EXCELLENT SERVICE.  We were in a semi-rush to make our 7:30pm curtain call, and our waiter ensured that our food was out in time for us to enjoy our meal.  We even had to send our steak back to be re-grilled, and he did so quickly and courteously.\n\nRib eye - This was the highlight of the table - marbled and juicy, with a tangy teriyaki sauce.  As I mentioned above, we had to send it back to be regrilled (we asked for medium rare, but I think in their rush to get us to our show, it came out a bit rare), but it was PERFECT the second time around.  Highly recommend.\n\nCorn side dish - You can't go wrong with sweet corn with cheese, cilantro, and lime.  I love tex-mex corn!\n\nHalibut - The waiter recommended this fish over the salmon and tuna.  It was soft with a crispy top.  I think it was over-shadowed by the steak, but still good.\n\nChopped salad - Our attempt to balance out our meal with some ruffage.  Good.\n\nLobster taco - An appetizer I think we could have done without.  Doesn't really stand out in my mind at all, though I didn't appreciate that the waiter was able to give us 4 pieces to share (instead of the standard 3).\n\nAll in all, a solid meal, but would I come back?

We walked in and were quickly greeted by two hostess with bright colored shirts and black suits on. The place was very colorful with one wall with a rainbow of agua de fresca jugs. We sat in the middle area, where the boys could still see the games going on on the other side of the glass wall in the sports bet area. Our waiter was nice yet cocky like bobby flay, which almost rubbed me the wrong way. After a heavy night of drinking, I wasn't in the mood for any more alcohol, even though the bellini sounded good! I ordered the cactus pear ice tea ($4). The ice tea had a southern tea feel, slightly flowery. I believe it comes with some simple syrup that you could put in it, but I think it tastes better without it. \n\nBf: do you have any regular ice tea? \nwaiter: NO \n=( \n\nWe were brought a basket of 4 different kinds of bread. Jalapeno muffin, regular corn bread, jalapeno scone and coffee cake. The jalapeno muffin was a perfectly buttery, light, and flakey and had tiny bright green flakes of jalapenos so it had a kick of heat, but not too hot where it burned your mouth. The regular corn bread had specks of red and green chile flakes, and perfectly baked where it was still moist. The scone had a hint of sweet taste with some dried raisins and cranberries. The coffee cake wasn't too sweet, where you really needed to drink it with coffee. \n\nas per suggestion by the waiter, we ordered the appetizer Crispy Bacon + Hash Brown Quesadilla with fried egg and spicy tomato salsa. this was so good. the tortilla tasted homemade, where it was light and fluffy and not chewy. the bacon gave it the saltyness and the hashbrown a slight crisp. all together with the fried egg and salsa on top... yum \n\n\nthe waiter suggested the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalapeno Crema as the perfect dish to display bobby flays style of balancing sweet and savory so i wanted to get it. i was instructed to make sure to eat the salmon with the white sauce. the salmon was perfectly cooked where it was flaky and just fell apart while still being moist. the sauces were so bright and the colors were vibrant. it had a nice fresh salsa on top. all together it was nice. i had expected a bit more of fire in bobby flays dish, but it was just enough that you could appreciate all the flavors. \n\nSpicy Scrambled Eggs (Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese) Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham+ Buttermilk Biscuits. wow! you'd think \"what, its just scrambled eggs\" but the scrambled eggs were delicious! i swear i love goat cheese. it was creamy and salty and hearty. the ham was sweet and salty and makes your mouth water. the biscuits were a bit spicy like it had a bunch of black pepper in it and buttery at the same time. great dish! \n\nyou could get a side of creamy grits or homestyle fries with the egg dishes. WOW these grits were so freakin good. i think they had goat cheese in them as well. so creamy and tasty. \n\nmy friend and her bf both got the scrambled egg enchilada. they said it was good. \n\noverall i was very pleased with mesa grill. his dishes werent as spicy as i had expected, as hes always bringing in the heat, but everything had a nice balance of heat that you could still taste the flavors of the dishes. yeah bobby!"

We arrived late to our reservation due to incorrect navigation, but the staff was very polite and understanding and still seated us right away. The customer service here is above average. We were soon greeted by our server who was very knowledgable about the menu and recommendations. We ordered the rabbit and a chicken quesadilla. The rabbit was cooked perfectly and the sauce that accompanied it was delicious! They also had a couscous with the rabbit that was so amazing! Even though it was a side, the couscous was my favorite of all the items we had here. The quesadilla was also very tasty, and it was a far more simple dish. Neither dish was over the top amazing, but both were cooked perfectly and had good flavor. The reason for the lack of stars in this review is due to the price. Although both dishes were great, to me, the prices were too high for overall experience."

Fame and television programing has me pre-sold on the idea that this is going to be a very good experience. As a consumer I am not concerned that the beer delivery truck was delayed or that the kitchen didn't estimate what dishes would sell well enough that they were running out of portions by 1:00 in the afternoon. Now the food, I had the pork which was very good, cooked really well and was flavorful. My companion had a specialty burger and said it was very good as well. However, neither one of us were so enamored with the food and experience that we would go out of our way to go back.

Instead of ordering two meals, we ordered 5 appetizers which were reasonably priced and more than enough food for the two of us.  It was a fantastic meal and we got to try a number of dishes without breaking the bank.  Sure, we probably missed out on an incredibly steak but we left happy.\n\nOnly reason for not giving 5 stars was the ambience.

They arrived a strong pink inside.  \n\nThe tamale was absolutely awful, stuffed with what seemed like Jack in the Box taco filling.  No one at the table cared for the tamale.  My wife and I tried the chile relleno.  I don't know what Bobby Flay knows about Southwestern or Mexican food, but the relleno arrived coated in an extra crunchy cornmeal batter.  The filling, which is why the chile is called a relleno, was undiscernable.\n\nOne companion ordered the filet mignon and ordered it medium.  It arrived medium-rare.  Maybe the cooks had mixed up the lamb chops with the filet order.  At any rate, the filet was returned to the kitchen for additional cooking.  The filet was outstanding, rubbed with a chipotle mixture, which gave the meat a smoky, spicy kick.\n\nThe final person of our foursome ordered a New York steak.  He was disappointed.

His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  \n\nA friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\nI think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nSorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune."

It was so good, we raved about it so much, that the couple at the next table both ordered the pork tenderloin as well, and thanked us profusely for the recommendation!  I was a bit disappointed in the pear upside down cake for dessert.  It would only get 3 stars.  But the total experience is still 5 stars."

The lamb was cooked very well but it was way over seasoned even for me.\n\nHis side.\nI had the sweet potato hash.  Kind of a New Mexico spin on eggs Benedict.\n\nI expected the spice and seasoning to be over the top so I was not surprised by this.  I liked the flavor of the hash and the chili's with the spicy chicken.  I was surprised at the portion of the eggs.  I was fully expecting a \"Celebrity\" chef portion of food and was quit happy with the amount of food that I got.\n\nI hear complaints from people on Yelp about quantity and price here.  It is Bobby Flay!  I fully expect small portions, high prices but also quality.  I was happy with the quality of the food we got I was happy with the service as well.\n\nAs Bobby, we are on a first name basis now, is known for grilling I will have to come back and try a steak as I had brunch.    If he cooks the steak as well as he cooks the lamb I am sure I will be happy.\n\nAll in all it was a pleasant meal.  To much \"rub\" on the lamb for both of us but the hash was excellent.\n\nOnly the truth!"

This is with 3 apps, a meal for each and 2 desserts with mucho cocktails and some coffee for some. \n\nI ordered the chicken mole which had wonderful chicken but the mole was on the sweeter vs. spicy side. I like the combo of sweet and spicy but this was too sweet and I have a major sweet tooth. The best thing ever was the corn. It was grilled and mixed with lime, creme fraiche, cilantro, some other cheese and I wish I ordered a bucket of it. \n\nThe relleno was good but had a corn crust that wasn't  exciting. I heard the Halibut was perfect, gone before I could sample. Next time...\n\nI almost forgot the apps. The duck with blue corn pancake was small but 5 stars itself. The dessert with banana cream was delicious. I forgot the other one.\n\nThe service, excellent."

The tuna was excellent and I could have used a double portion.  The Goat Cheese Queso was very good, but how could you go wrong with melted cheese.\n\nFor dinner, the coffee rubbed filet and the green chili ciopino with crispy squash blossom and mashed potatoes for sides.  The cioppino was very fresh and flavorful.  Getting the shrimp peeled was a little messy,  but worth the added flavor.  My only complaint was that after eating most of the seafood from the dish the green chili base was not quite as visually appealing.  The filet was tender and the coffee rub wasn't overpowering.  Unfortunately, the filet wasn't hot and the plate was cold so the mushrooms and ancho chili sauce didn't come across very well.  The sqaush blossoms where incredibly light and the mashed potatoes were creamy.  \n\nI'll definitely be back, but I would probably opt for lunch instead of dinner."

Am not a big fan of Bobby Flay - being of the opinion that he is the Ryan Seacrest of the Food Network.  But Mesa Grill did not disappoint - the food was cooked well, tasty and creative.  I was happily surprised by the meal.  Knowing how Bobby Flay likes lobsters, chili, corn and alcohol, I had the paella dish - all the seafood was cooked perfectly and a drink called the black widow - All of which was tasty.  The restaurant itself has great acoustics - for being filled on a Saturday night, you could actually hear the person next to you and not all the conversations around you.  Service was ehh - our waiter reeked of alcohol and was not the most attentive."

We were at the table maybe two minutes before our server (the amazing Encina) came over with our menus and a mouth-watering description of the night's specials. We were taken aback by the amazing service and care, not only because Encina and the rest of the staff care about their food and their customers but also because Lillie's Noodle House and Grotto Ristorante at the Golden nugget were such a shit-show with their horrific excuses for service (see those reviews for why).\n\nShe gave us a few minutes to peruse the drink menu and came back with waters before taking our order. We couldn't resist asking for her favorite appetizers and ended up getting two AMAZING appetizers:\n-Roasted Corn Soup: the soup itself is light and sweet, a delicious puree of sweet corn.  It came out warm and had a slight bit of heat that lingered in your mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and a great way to begin our meal.\n-Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla: It's a great appetizer for four or two. The tortilla was crispy and had a little char to it. Inside, the cheese and meat mingled amazingly. On top, the cotija and quacamole beckoned us to the plate like Sirens.\n\nWe got our drinks and commented on how the meal was batting-a-thousand so far.\nWhite Peach Margarita (my friend and one of my brothers): the sweetest of the bunch. Tasty and light; great balance between the tequila and white peach flavors.\nCadillac Margarita (my other brother): I like to taste my alcohol when I'm drinking and a Caddy guarantees that I will. This was a great margarita!\nCactus Pear Margarita (my drink): I ordered this one because of the rave reviews on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't too sweet and packed a nice punch. The flavor was great.\n\nEncina was back within ten minutes to take our orders. Here's what we got (and loved):\n-Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna: good God almighty this was good (for an agnostic guy to say this is saying something)!!! The tuna was cooked perfectly. The spicy sear on the outside was enough of a crunch to perfectly contrast the tender tuna. The mango glaze the accompanied the fish was sweet enough to enhance the fish without being too sweet or overpowering. The pine-nut cous cous was soft and delicious. The green and red peppercorn sauces on the plate were the perfect accent. The peppercorns were a soft burst of peppery goodness.\n-Sixteen Spice Chicken: although not the route I would have gone, this was really good. For those who want to play it safe. The chicken was tender and the sixteen spices were definitely a party in my mouth, but chicken just isn't adventurous for me. My brother loved it; we both agreed that the spiciness level was great.\n-Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The rub on the outside could very well be the best thing ever put onto a piece of meat. The coffee shined through enough that you knew it was there, but didn't take over the dish. The mushroom-ancho chile sauce was the perfect sauce.\n-Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: these were incredible!!! The spices were just right and the meat was tender. The garlic tamale was delicious as well.\n\nEncina checked on us throughout the meal and kept us laughing. Once we were done, she put down the drink menu and the desert menu and said, \"Now, I know you're not leaving without another drink and some desert!\" She knew us too well!!! Here's the grand finale:\n-Pomegranate martini (friend): Light on pomegranate taste. Tasted a little cough-syrupy. She was not impressed, but our tastebuds may have needed a nap after the amazing dinner we had.\n-Mesa Pisco Sour: very nice! The alcohol shone through without being too much.\n-Mango Buttermilk Upside Down Cake: not enough to share for more than two, but I was really the only one who wanted desert so it was perfect for everyone to have a taste. The cake was nice, light, and warm. The caramel rum sauce was fantastic and the mango ice cream was great.\n\nWe got to talking about how it was my birthday. At another table, I guess Encina heard us. She said, \"I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but did I hear a birthday over here?\" They pointed to me and she replied, \"OK. Don't go anywhere\" and sprinted across the restaurant. She came back, told me to close my eyes as she lit a candle and placed it in a small ramekin of their homemade vanilla-bean whipped cream (best ever!). She told me to make a wish before I opened my eyes and said, \"From my heart, happy birthday.\" It was one of the nicest restaurant birthdays I've ever had.\n\nOverall, we couldn't have been happier with dropping close to $300 on a dinner for four. The food was amazing! The service was spectacular. Encina is incredibly sweet and takes care of you. She took the absolute best care of us.\n\nDo yourself and your tastebuds a favor and eat at Mesa Grill!"

Service was wonderful, food presentation nice, bread basket unique!\n\nAppetizers:\n\"Rough Cut\" Raw Tuna Nachos - $15 for a rather small portion, but each bite was full of flavor and a looming unexpected, but anticipated, spice. Came with only 6 pieces of nacho chips! \n\nTiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - $16;  very tasty, bigger portion than expected. I didn't get to eat too much of it.\n\nEntrees:\nPork tenderloin - not as spicy as I thought it was going to be, slightly disappointed from that. However, the pork was really tender, and portions were just right. Really good use of vibrant orange sauces.\n\nNew york strip steak - this didn't come with anything. The menu didn't mention it'd come with anything..but I guess I just assumed? It was a large plate with a hunk of meat, ontop a drizzle of vibrant sauce. The steak was very good. But...it was just a piece of steak, nothing more.\n\nDessert:\nSampler, which included warm chocolate cake, burnt orange cheesecake, and warm caramel pineapple empanada. All of them were good...but the empanada...I guess I just wasn't a fan. It kinda reminded me of an apple turnover. =(\n\nOverall though, this place was very good. Each plate of food was very solid; explosive flavor, nice sauce. The 7 of us left extremely full."

Next I had the chile relleno and my husband had poached eggs over pork and sweet potato hash.  Both were amazing.  No skimping on spice.  Everything was sooo good that I would have licked the plates.  We also had deserts.  The strawberry and gooseberry shortcake was recommended to us and we were glad to have tried it.  I though it was going to be lame but I was wrong.  It had the perfect amount of saltiness and tartness.  We also had the chocolate cornbread pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip."

Several times, I made eye contact with him and he walked right past our table.  He never checked in with us and when I asked him for the check, he nodded, placed it on our table after an interval and returned it without so much as a \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day.\"  In a service town, I'm surprised he has a job.  Maybe just a bad day?\n\nThe food!  It was good with some great mixed in.  We started with the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla which was the highlight of our meal.  Delicious smokey flavor, great guacamole and a tangy habanero (?) sauce.  Really good and very filling.  This could certainly be an entree, especially at lunch when we went.  My fella enjoyed the Smoked Shrimp Tacos.  Nothing outstanding but good.  I had the Lamb Cobb Salad.  The components of the salad were tasty but the presentation was an absolute mess.  Also, the massive size of the salad dwarfed the portion of lamb.  Ill-conceived but again, tasty.\n\nI'm not opposed to going back to Mesa Grill since there were many other menu items that looked appealing.  I have to say, however, that in a city with so much competition from other restaurants, there are some areas they could tighten up."

The walk was OK in that it did increase our appetites.\n\nOnce at Mesa, The hostess sat us down, gave us some menus, and we waited for the rest of our party to show up before being shown our table. \n\nOur table sat a dozen comfortably as it was long enough.

The salad was spicy, but lacked enough spinach to really enjoy it as a salad. the vinaigrette dominated everything to the point where you couldn't really taste the individual ingredients. There was too much of it. I did like the texture. I wasn't wowed.\n\nNext up was the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Again, the food was good. The sauce dominated. And with a serving size so big, why did I have to ask for more tortillas? When has two ever been enough?\n\nI ordered off menu for dessert.

I had the green chile burger with southwest fries. It was just as tasty as I imagined it would be. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was so good! The sauce they put on it is spicy and perfect! We loved it so much, we went back two days later. The ahi nachos and salmon are also delicious! We loved everything we tried!"

            "review": "I chose Mesa Grill after hearing Delmonico's is way overrated. Having eaten at the Bahamas location, and despite my aversion to Bobby Flay, I decided to give the Las Vegas MG a try.\n\n1. Awkward seating arrangement: We had a table of six, and it seemed like they had to put a table in the middle of a seating arrangement in order to fit us. We would've been perfectly fine if the wait staff wasn't continually bumping into my friends' chairs and then asking them to move out the way. That was uncool.\n\n2. Food was great. Everyone was really happy with their dishes. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the duck, ribeye and pork tenderloins. For sides, pesto mashed potatoes, baby carrots, tiger shrimp tamale and sauteed spinach. We had to wait a bit for a couple of the sides because the waitress forgot them, but it wasn't too bad. Food came out hot and tasty.\n\n3. Desserts were okay. I enjoyed my spicy chocolate creme brulee in the Bahamas more than the profiteroles I had. I thought they were really stingy with the iced cream which put me off a bit.\n\n4. Service was alright. Our waitress was chatty and came around a few times to check on us.\n\nMesa Grill Las Vegas didn't disappoint and I wouldn't be against visiting BF's other restaurants."

We ordered the Crimini Mushroom Quesadilla--which was outstanding!  Delicious and the fried egg on top just pushed it over the top.  \n\nMain dish was the world-famous pork tenderloin.  Unfortunately, for me, the spicy-crusted outer layer was way too spicy--brought me to tears.  After slicing off the crust, the tenderloin was tender but flavorless.  The sauces delightful.  The tamale accompanying the tenderloin medallions was delicious.\n\nMy friend had the lamb chops.   One of the chops had a lot of gristle and was hard to get a good bite.  Again, the spice was also too heavy for her liking.\n\nWe shared the spicy sweet potatoes -- which were layer upon layer upon layer of thinly sliced potatoes with just the right amount of heat.\n\nService was excellent--we arrived about 6:00 pm on Sunday night.  I highly recommend the white peach margarita--two of these helped me fend off the heat!  \n\nI probably will not return due to the hot spice--but it was an enjoyable experience and great presentation."

The food was amazing hands down; the service on the other hand was a huge disappointment. We had reservations however we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Then the waiter we had was nothing less than rude. It was very clear he did not want to be there. I had the pork tenderloin sand which and it truly was everything I hoped it would be. Being a customer service manager I have expectations on what customer service should be, and would think Bobby would feel the same. On a scale of 1-5 the Customer service rating = 2  however the quality of food = 5. Normally I would chalk up the service as the waiter was just having a bad day, but being that the girls at the hostess stand were no better its hard to think it was just a bad day for everyone working that day. I am not sure I would return to this one of his establishments but would for sure try another one."

I was not impressed with the food at all.  \n\nI had a prickly cactus margarita (it was a delicious reddish pink color and was amazing) and Hubs tried a mezcal (which is like tequila but isn't).  For starters, we went with the server's recommendation. She said it is the most \"popular\" appetizer - Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and cilantro sauce.  This was SMALL.  There were four medium sized (I think they were smaller than they should have been) shrimp with a tamale on the side. It really looked like the tamale was the main part of the dish and the shrimp were the side garnish.  There was nothing special about the shrimp. They looked like four cooked and peeled shrimp. I was pretty disappointed.\n\nFor the mains, Hubs had the rabbit  - Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbit with toasted chile cous cous, almonds, currants in a smoked red pepper sauce and I had the Halibut with green chile curry sauce and corn and cactus salsa. Originally, this was supposed to be Wild Stripe Bass, but there were some weather issues back East so they didn't get their fish shipment in that day.\n\nMy halibut was good. Nice crunch on the top of the fish and the green chile curry sauce was mild.  I liked it. It was a huge portion of fish.  Hubs' rabbit was just ok - most people don't like the gamey flavor of rabbit, but that is what the rabbit lacked. It tasted more like chicken than rabbit.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the banana cream pie.  It was pretty light and a good way to end the meal.\n\nThe service was ok. At first, the server was very attentive and quick but after we got our appetizers, she was quite slow. Having experience in the food industry, I did notice that her section filled up quickly and she had small tables like us but also parties of 6 or more. She was friendly enough though.\n\nI believe there are better Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  Mesa Grill is known for grilling so maybe the steaks are better?"

I decided not to contradict as I had my 3 yr old around, we barely ate, paid the check and walked out, they did not compensate the dish, neither did they apologize. So not done....not going back."

This is one of those that parts were absolutely outstanding, while other parts...whaaaaa?\n\nThe start wasn't so great.  Granted, we went without reservations, so I take that into account.  We were told to come back at 9:45 when we got there at 9:15.  We did so, but still waited another 20 minutes.  The hostess was nice enough, but there were three hostesses, and it seemed like only one was really working.  The other two just looked upon the first to do the work.  However, they were all very nice.\n\nOk, we sit down and looked over the menus.  They had Duvel offered, and the pour was perfect.  This isn't always done with Duvel, so kudos for getting that down pat.    They brought corn bread that came in various forms (one was done with blue corn meal), and that was wonderful, along with the homemade breads.  \n\nI ordered the chili rubbed bone-in rib-eye medium rare to rare, and it was cooked perfectly.  My wife got the rabbit with spinach instead of the risotto, and it was cooked perfectly.  Our friend simply ordered a salad and had some of our meals (I shouldn't be eating 22 oz of rib-eye).  While it was all cooked very nicely, the spices were a bit weak, which was a disappointment.  Bobby Flay is known for his spices, and they simply didn't really come through.  \n\nI must say that the service was some of the best I have ever received.  The waiter has been working there for six years, and it shows.  The entire waitstaff was absolutely wonderful, and that is the main reason for the 4 stars.  I can't stress enough that the service was simply impeccable.  It may have been the best service I have ever received at a restaurant.\n\nWhat keeps it from being five stars was the cost of the meal (expected, but still a bit high for what was presented), and the lack of spiciness.  This is a good restaurant, but with so many options in Vegas, it may be a while before I go back, as there are many others that I would like to try first. If you have some time, check the place out, especially if you are near the center part of the strip."

DO NOT GET THIS. it tastes like it was mass produced and heated up from costco. \n\nhazelnut ice cream + biscotti: pretty good but if you mess up ice cream, you pretty much fail at life."

The sauce was savory and spot on.\nPortions were a bit on the smaller portion scale for the $$$ prices on the menu so doing family style might not be ideal.\n\nThe only thing we didn't like was one of the sides - spinach rossito because of the cheese they put in made it very salty. The waiter was nice enough to replace it with mashed potato. The service was decent but they forgot to bring extra bowls even though they weren't too busy."

            "review": "I have to second what a lot of the yelpers have said-- the Brunch experience is really disappointing.  The front of house seemed bummed to see us arrive, the welcome wasn't warm,  It was a Saturday morning at 11 am, and I expect people to put on a good face for customers approaching.  Our waiter was excellent and helpful though, and the service overall was very good. \n\nI ordered the quesadila with fried cotija cheese filled with crispy bacon and hash browns, topped with a fried egg. It was cooked poorly with one half cooked to an embarrassing crisp that turned into dust when it met my firm fork hand, and the other half plainly under cooked. The bacon was chewy, which doesn't work in this dish, although it was tasty it was clearly undercooked. The topping of a fresh salsa was over-seasoned with salt and tasted like a tomato salt-sa (okay, sorry about that pun)\n\nI also had the roasted corn chowder, which was nice and sweet. A pretty nice brunch offering.  The bread basket was very good, with the jalapeno muffin being the star. \n\nI've had the burger here, and have raved about it after trying it once at the bar-- but on this occasion the muenster cheese had melted into no where land. And, when I sliced into it I could see it wasn't cooked evenly.  When that happens it breaks apart and is a big mess. It was a disappointing  end to my meal.\n\nI won't be back. I wish I had come for dinner, it seems to be more of the chef's game, and it appears the kitchen staff's all-stars work that shift, based on the reviews here.  \n\nNot recommended for Brunch."

I am torn on giving 4 stars...but I don't want to give 3 either...let's say 3 1/2 stars for Mesa. \n\nThe service was definitely 5 stars. We had an awesome, attentive, friendly, sweet waiter who really did an awesome job. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The table was large and the seating was comfortable. \n\nWhen it comes to the food though...I just wasn't that impressed :( I had really high hopes for Mesa...I have heard so many people tell me how much they love it and how it will be some of the best food I will ever eat. I beg to differ.\n\nLet me break it down, we had a LOT of food, so I feel like me giving 3 stars for food is justified:\n\nAppetizers - Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\", Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Corn Tamale, Blue Corn Pancake with Duck, Yucatan Chicken Tacos. \n\nWe ordered four appetizers for five people. That should be enough, right? Wrong. These appetizers are tiny. And expensive for the portion you receive! The total for just the appetizers was $60. Yes, 6-0 dollars. One appetizer was barely enough for two people. And let me state for the record, I have no problem throwing down money for good food, but I thought it was absolutely ridiculous the amount charged for tiny little bites of food.\n\nBut how did it taste, you ask? Okay. The cheese dip was awesome. I will give Mr. Flay that - he can make a mean cheese dip. But, if you didn't eat it fast enough, it hardened. So, eat quickly when you order the queso! The shrimp tamale was also pretty good. The shrimp were large and juicy, the corn filling was nice and flavorful, which a yummy cilantro cream sauce. The blue pancake with duck was alright...I wouldn't eat it again. It was shredded duck in a super rich BBQ sauce, just okay. The chicken tacos were served with red onions and \"chile BBQ sauce\" that tasted just like Thai food...pad thai to be exact. \n\nSides - Glazed Baby Carrots with brown sugar, Roasted Corn with smoked chile's and Cotija cheese, Saut\u00e9ed Spinach, Sweet Potato Tamale with Pecan Butter.\n\nI tried all of these sides. This place is like Ruth's Chris where you order your meat, and everything else on the side, your entree doesn't come with anything.\n\nThe baby carrots had a nice flavor, but they were a little undercooked for my taste. I prefer softer carrots. The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter - sounds awesome right? Sounds sweet and delicious, right? Well, it tastes like Masa. The saut\u00e9ed spinach was literally just that. Spinach. Now, I love spinach, and I can eat it plain or dressed up, but when I pay $8 for spinach, I would expect some garlic, or salt...or anything...nope. This was seriously cooked spinach with no other flavors. \n\nThe Roasted Corn was the star of the sides. It was absolutely delicious. The corn kernels were crisp and fresh, served in an awesome creamy, cheesy sauce that was spicy, but not too overpowering. Just awesome. \n\nEntrees - Coffee Rubbed Filet MIgnon, Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.\n\nThree of us had the filet, the other two had the pork. Since I can't eat pork, I don't want to say much about it, but I will say BF said it was good, but not the best ever. Maybe if he ever gets on the ball and starts Yelping again, he can tell you about it himself.\n\nThe filet...very large cut of meat, too much to finish. It was soft, it was coffee rubbed, it didn't really taste like anything. The coffee rub was more of a burnt crust. I got a hint of coffee, but mostly I just tasted burn. \n\nIt was served on some mushroom, ancho chile sauce. The mushrooms were very good. Spicy and caramelized. I loved the sauce...but the filet? I would rather go to Ruth's Chris. honestly.\n\nAfter dinner our friends ordered dessert and coffee. I tried the coffee, good flavor. I took a bite of their Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake - it was very good, rich, sweet, served with a caramelized rum sauce. \n\nOverall, this place was just alright. There were a few things that hit high notes with me, but they were appetizers and sides, and I don't think I would come back just for those items. The majority of the food was just okay, not amazing, not the best I have ever had. \n\nI think I will just stick to making my Bobby Flay recipes at home, they taste better and they are cheaper!"

I mean, even his famous restaurant in Las Vegas is called Mesa GRILL.\n\nHowever, my Mesa Burger just didn't have that awesome grilling taste that one would expect.  A properly grilled burger should have been more charred from the high heat of the flame.\n\nMy burger tasted like any typical burger from an ordinary restaurant.  Nothing really stood out.\n\nAlso, the service here was not good.  We had to repeatedly ask for the same request over and over again.  It really wasn't that busy, so I don't understand why the waiter couldn't get the request right from the first time.\n\nThe bread basket was good here though.  It had that heat that one expect from a Southwestern cuisine.\n\nETA - We went there during the weekend lunch (brunch), so they didn't have the classic entree like the Rib Eye.  Maybe the dinner menu would have tasted better, but since we couldn't make it for dinner we had to settle for what was on the lunch menu.  Nevertheless, they have the proper equipment and the knowledgeable technique so the burger should have tasted better.\n\nOverall, I love Caesars Palace and respect Bobby Flay, I just didn't love Mesa Grill.  It was just an average type of place."

The interesting part is that Mesa Grill required the customers to provide their credit card numbers. If the customers didn't show up on their reservations, they would charge the credit cards $50. That is interesting, but I don't mind it. I think if people really want to go, they would be willing to go through the trouble.\n\nI love the ceiling with the flaming painting. Nothing would match better with Bobby Flay's cooking style, chili peppers and spices. Before going to Mesa Grill, I was very worried that I couldn't get anything to eat, because I don't eat spicy food at all. When we got there, I talked to the server. He said that most of Bobby's food is not that spicy, and the chili add flavors. He gave a couple of suggestions, and I went with the WILD STRIPED BASS. My husband got the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. And, we shared BLUE CORN PANCAKE for appetizer.\n\nThe BLUE CORN PANCAKE is served with shredded pieces of duck. The first bite definitely reminded me of the Chinese Peking duck. The duck was good and juicy. Even though there was Habanero (one of the most intense chili pepper in the world), it wasn't spicy at all. It was very flavorful. My husband loved it! His pork tenderloin was placed nicely on the plate. The rubbed was definitely spicy. Bryan said it was a bit spicy for him, but it was edible. The side SWEET POTATO TAMALE was sweet and delicious. It was a perfect balance with the spicy pork. My WILD STRIPED BASS was crispy on the outside, and cooked perfect on the inside. My favorite was the Piquillo Pepper Clam Chowder under the bass. It was packed with different layers of flavors, and it was not spicy! Fantastic!\n\nThe meal was great. For the two of us, our check was about $120. The food was very good. Bobby has lived up to his reputation. I definitely respect him more. I would love to go back again. This time, I will save some rooms for dessert!"

We split the plates, so we could have a little of both. \n\nI had a peach margarita - AWESOME, and my husband had the \"Perfect Margarita\" - also AWESOME. \n\nMy salad was so salty. It was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, but it was sprinkled with sea salt, so when I took a bite, I got salty, crunchy bits - not good. The chicken for the salad was over seasoned, as was the shrimp. The sauces that came with the shrimp were excellent. \n\nI'm bummed because I expected a better meal.

The bar was mostly full, waited behind a woman who was buying 5 margarita's and she stood there sipping on one for some reason while her friends sat a table. Luckily 3 seats became available at the other end and the 2 of us sat. And waited and then waited some more. The bartender on our side never once acknowledged us. Not even a glance for almost 10 minutes. She was getting a bottle of wine for man to take out somewhere. Going into detail about how she could not give him the Mesa glasses. I understand helping customers but sometimes a small glance to let one know you exist is all it takes for good service.I don't mind waiting but I do want to know we will be served at some point. But after 10 minutes of sitting there when she only had the 2 of us, the wine customer who already had his wine and a single man who was already served well that is not acceptable so we left. I am certain she did not notice or care but her attitude made me question another visit."

No sooner had we landed in the firey furnace of hell (aka Vegas) then we dashed into Caesar's and were promptly seated at a spacious table at the Mesa Grill.  The complimentary bread basket is like your own private bakery chock full of muffins and rolls and bread sticks and bread...made of different textures and colors of corn and whole grains. I loved the blue corn muffins so much that I ate my husband's and my brothers-in-law's and was tempted to creep my fingers over to the next table and swipe theirs too!\n\nMy husband ordered iced tea which arrived with a tiny glass decanter of simple syrup with which to sweeten it--but don't think they limited your selection to the simple syrup---they also offered all sorts of natural sugars and artificial sweeteners!  I go to nice places on occasion but I can't think of the last time I was so impressed with small details!   I felt like some kind of hillbilly!\n\nI ordered the fresh fish of the day which was tasty although I don't really remember it as much as the shrimp tamale my husband ordered.  I can hardly wait to go back to Vegas to have another one of those for myself!  One of my brothers-in-law ordered the blue corn buttermilk waffle with blackberry bourbon syrup and vanilla creme fraiche.  I have to say that it was delicious, but it was fourteen dollars, and compared to the other entrees we had at our table with meat and fresh seafood was comparatively priced--therefore overpriced.  I mean a waffle.  For fourteen bucks.  My other brother-in-law ordered the chilaquiles.  Which were also very flavorful and complex.  \n\nI had never had blue corn before so I bought some Bob's Red Mill blue cornmeal on Amazon and have begun to experiment.  Not quite ready for a Bobby Flay throwdown, however."

The reservation system is a bit of a pain, you call a central line for everything at Caesars and then have to say the name of the property that you are trying to make a reservation for. I had to call a couple of times because we had to make a change to our reservation, and every time it sent me to the wrong place on the first 1 or 2 tries. I was finally able to successfully connect to the correct reservations folks though and once I got through everything went smoothly. \n\nWe had a party of 6 and everyone loved their meal. Our friends were ordering wine by the glass and the server recommended a very nice bottle instead which was surprisingly affordable. Everyone loved their meal. \n\nMy DH and I started with the shrimp tamales since there were so many recommendations for them here and they are 1 of the 2-3 items that the waiter said have been on the menu since day 1. I thought they were very good, but wasn't blown away by them. Then we shared the coffee rubbed rib eye and the green chili cauliflower. both were outstanding. The steak was nicely charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare. The rub had a combination of savory and sweet in it and there were 2 sauces. A spicy green sauce and some kind of red sauce. They were both very good but the green on was my favorite. The cauliflower was to die for! I also had tastes of the salmon which was perfectly cooked and had a really lovely sauce and the pork tenderloin which has a very tasty rub. The fish portions seemed to be about average size, but the pork and steak portions were huge. our steak was 22 ounces, which was plenty for the 2 of us. \n\nMesa Grill is definitely worth a second visit."

My friend ordered a margarita and it wasn't to our liking.  Service was good, but not great. The food was OK, i already got tired of my dish after the 3rd bite.  It was maybe too sweet? Too many flavors combining and its not concentrating on one flavor. When Bobby cooks on Food Network, your mouth waters, but at Mesa Grill...I didn't.  I tried Emerils before Mesa Grill, and loved Emerils. But to mention we could order off the BRUNCH menu only.  I looked at the pics from the dinner menu, and they look very good.

The most wonderful thing there that I put in my face was the mushroom-fontina quesadilla, which was topped with ricotta, salsa verde, a fried egg, and garnished with cilantro. IT IS AMAZING. I've also tasted the Chorizo Meatballs - why is this not a full entree with pasta?; the ribeye - So much flavor; the filet mignon - it just melts in your mouth; the Yucatan Chicken Tacos - grilled chicken, grilled, onions, mint, cilantro, and a delicious peanut chile BBQ sauce; the roasted corn side dish - just wow. I've also had some other previous sides and appetizers from my previous visit, which were all extremely tasty. Oh!, and the bread basket they bring to the table has a jalapeno cheese bread, raisin molasses (I think), and a spicy cornbread muffin.\n\nDRINKS:\nI've had a couple tequila and whisky based cocktails, and all were great. This last time I had a rye whiskey cocktail that had champagne and orange peel, which was one of the better whiskey drinks I've had.\n\nSERVICE: Attentive and professional."

Our waiter was a dick (wish I knew his name so you could avoid his douche-ness) and the menu was less than innovative. Watching Bobby on TV, you'd think his dishes would have a little more spunk and creativity involved but it was all just blah. \n\n-Goat Cheese 'Queso Fundido': Very good, but then again how hard is it to screw up melted cheese? Not super creative or special. \n-Chile Relleno: 'cornmeal crust' was very dry, pepper was undercooked and tough, sauce was only redeeming part. \n-Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: If you don't like cumin, you will hate this. It's LOADED on the outside with cumin like someone dumped a whole spice jar of it on there (which I hate and wasn't mentioned or I wouldn't have ordered it). Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce is VERY spicy and I like spice. Between cutting off the outside to avoid choking on the cumin and not being able to eat most of the mushrooms, it was wasted. It was, however, cooked perfectly as I ordered it medium. \n\nWe didn't have cocktails, only wine so I can't speak about the mixed drinks. The whole experience was a total letdown. There are so many better places in Vegas... would not waste my time or money on this one again."

I have always been somewhat annoyed by Bobby Flay, for a variety of reasons. Mesa Grill overcame my issues with their no-show celebrity chef. \nI had the charred, bone-in, ribeye with a sweet and spicy chipotle glaze with the green chili queso smothered mashed potatoes. The potatoes were very good and cheesy with just the right chili bite. That was fine. Let's get to the main event. The ribeye was almost confrontational in its size and presentation. Everything about the prep and presentation was..., aggressive: aggressively cooked over a very hot charcoal grill, intensely spiced and plated with very little else on the place other than a little bit sauce and garnish. Let me tell you, it works. When you have a prime piece of beef like that, perfectly cooked, I don't know what more you should do to spruce it up. I made the comment, \"I could see Elvis eating this.\" All of the other members of my party were very happy with their meals. The chorizo tamale was a little dry but it was still well executed. The atmosphere is an extremely modern, Southwest vibe. I thought the \"lobby\" looked a little like something out of Barbarella. But I did like that movie... The service was good. It is a little spendy but the quality of the ingredients and presentation more than met my value expectations."

Even with the bar staff, the service was solid.\n\nThe food as has been well documented is fantastic if you make the right choices.  The blue cornmeal muffins that come out with the bread are excellent.  I started with the tiger prawn tamale.  The tamale itself was done perfectly and not over spiced, instead letting the subtle maza mix with the sweet and smoky corn veloute served under it.  The prawns themselves were succulent and extremely fresh.\n\nMy main course was the grouper.  It was very good, but nothing too original or mind blowing.  The highlight of my meal was actually the side of corn I wittingly ordered.  I usually have a knack for picking the best item on a menu (or at least the one that sounds like they really know what they're doing on that also fancies my taste buds) and this corn was another prime example of that.  The roasted corn is done in a cream stock with nopal (cactus), with hints of lime and topped with cotija cheese.  The result is a perfect balance of a rich blend of sweet, sour, and salty.\n\nAll in all, the food lives up to the billing, though I think it's better to stick with the signature dishes."

The dessert was very good as well dont remember what it was called because i was being adventurous but tempura bananas figured very heavily into the equation.

Seriously, one of the best meals I have ever had.\n\nI cannot wait to go back!!"

I was famished and really didn't want to look for another place so we decided to give it a try.  We started of with a few cocktails and they were yummy.  I had some kind of corn soup, It was delicious.  We had a few other appetizers like the tamale, quesadilla, a chili relleno and a few more items.  It was all really good, the only thing we didn't care for was the tamale, which was a bit dry.  The service was fabulous.  We were able to get a table in 15 minutes without a reservation for dinner (cause it was a weekday night).  Bobby Flay does not disappoint.  It was a bit on the pricey side, but reasonable for a nice restaurant.  I will be back again when I am in Vegas next time."

On our first visit, we were totally annoyed with the waiter who apparently did not want to accept the fact that my husband and I did not want cocktails with our lunch.  He repeatedly asked us about drinks and we repeatedly said, \"No, thank you.\"  We ordered an array of appetizers for lunch which were all quite good.  When they arrived, again he brought up the subject of drinks and suggested a special margarita and said we could split it if we wanted to.  Split a drink?  Seriously?  We were not being cheap (just the array of appetizers built a pretty hefty tab) and are totally aware that when in Vegas you shell out the bucks for what you want and we have no problem with that.  We tried Mesa again on a visit last October and were relieved that this time we didn't get the cocktail hard-sell.  We both ordered the barbecued lamb cobb salad.  Our waiter felt the need to mention that the lamb wasn't really barbecued but more on the grilled side.  So, why not call it the grilled lamb cobb salad?  Not a deal breaker.  The salad was tasty although a bit mushy due to the guacamole in it.  Why not just slice or dice the avocado and keep the salad a nice consistency?  Can't say I just can't wait to get back to Vegas to go to Mesa Grill again.  We do say this about meals we have had at Todd English and Wofgang Puck where you get great quality and bang for your big bucks (after all, this IS Vegas). What I can say about this last experience is, \"Bobby, please bring me the rest of my salad!\"  The portion was incredibly small (about a cup full) to have been served in such a large bowl.  The large container only served to make us wonder where the rest of our salad was.  This item needs to be moved to the appetizer section.  If lamb is all that expensive, would it have hurt to at least throw in some extra greens to bulk it up a bit?   The good thing is that all during the rest of our trip, we kept laughing about this salad experience.  Bobby, we still love you but we don't love Mesa Grill!"

To begin with, the walls are not complete (I don't mean \"finished\") and there are purposeful gaps which let a lot of the Casino smoke smell into the dining area. I was seated with my back against a wall and it really put a damper on my food to have the smell of smoke accompany it. The food? Plain bad. Every dish that we ordered was saturated in a strong sauce, rendering the actual \"food\" (duck, calamari, chicken) tasteless. The diners to the right of us were overheard voicing the same complaint. My husband Jon's Venison was overcooked and dry. He complained and we received a coconut layer cake free of charge for dessert. Ironically, this cake was the reason that I had booked a dinner at this restaurant in the first place, and it too was dry and disappointing. I much prefer the European way - where a restaurant IS the chef, and the chef is actually in the kitchen overseeing/cooking and being an active part. Bobby Flay owns and operates this restaurant. Sure, he probably cooks there also, from time to time. But given all that we know he does (Food Network, Cookbooks, other restaurants...) he's a business man, not a chef. And the food reflected that."

My favorite entrees are spicy-rubbed pork tenderloin with mushroom couscous and wild rabbit with sweet potato stuffed corn tamale.  Both are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spicy on the tenderloin, and wonderful flavors.  The jalape\u00f1o corn muffins are out of this world.  If any had been remaining, I'd have stuffed them into my purse.  The service is superb with good wine list.  Reservations are highly recommended for dinner.

Just enough crunch on eat side with big chunks of crab along with their sauce. I can't rave about it enough because I am already a big crabcake person. \nBobby Flay is always make tamale this tamale that on his shows so I had to try his tamale.

We originally tried to walk in for dinner on a Friday night, but was told they were booked for the night.  The restaurant was almost completely empty, so I didn't really understand.  We returned again the next day to try brunch.\n\nThe brunch menu didn't seem very appealing to me, but we were starving and didn't want to go searching for something else.  To start we ordered the hash brown quesadilla.  I thought it was amazingly delicious.  The bacon had a nice smokey flavor and the fried egg just added to the flavor.\n\nFor entrees we got scrambled eggs chilaquile, sweet potato hash, mesa burger and the steak and eggs.  The steak and eggs is served with tortillas where you can build your own mini breakfast burrito.  The steak was cooked beautifully with the right amount of pink.  Chilaquile is served on a blue corn tortilla with creme fraiche.  The blue corn had a nice bold flavor and the whole dish meshed very well together.  Mesa burger was nothing special.  I was not a fan of the sweet potato hash, but that might be because I'm not too big on sweet potato.  However, no one was particularly fond of this dish so it can be skipped in my opinion.  The highlight of the meal was the hash brown quesadilla.\n\nOverall I thought the pricing was a bit high for brunch and would not return again for brunch.  I would possibly return one day again for dinner though."

We arrived at our appointed time and were immediately seated.  We had a nice view of the open kitchen and serving window, so it was easy to spot some of the popular dishes as we were contemplating our order. The assistant waiter promptly came over and offered water. Then, the only hiccup of the evening.  It took 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and greet us and take drink orders.  Service after that was just fine.\n\nFor $240 (inclusive of tax and a 20% tip), our party of two had:\n\n3 really great margaritas.  they have 3 different varieties.  I had the one that was described as part tart, part sweet.  It was pink in color. Really good.\n\n2 appetizers:  tiger shrimp tamale and lobster tacos.  both were outstanding.  as others have stated, the tacos are small.  however, when paired with a complete multicourse meal, they are perfect.\n\n2 entrees:  veal chop and lamb chop.  both came with a side tamale, so we didn't order extra sides.  The veal chop may have been the best I've ever had.  Really delicious.  The lamb was very good, but not as outstanding as the veal chop.\n\n1 desert:  shared the banana cream pudding.  It was good, but could have used a bit more banana flavor.\n\nThe atmosphere here can border on loud.  You are adjacent to the casino, and although the windows separating the restaurant from the casino are floor to ceiling, they have a louvered effect, so both sound, and sadly, cigarette smoke enter the restaurant.  The smoke is not too bad, but it is noticeable.\n\nThis was our second visit, the first being lunch.  Would definitely return again.  Just remember, for dinner especially, make a reservation!"

He didn't even acknowledge my wife for close to ten minutes, speaking solely to and making eye contact only with me. He actually dropped his \"game face\" before out of eyesight after leaving the table and rolled his eyes.\n\nThe meal started off well with decent margaritas (although the bar only accepts cash or room-charges). The meal then quickly deteriorated. After enjoying some good bread and muffin (one muffin for two people) we had a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer, which was tasty, but overly salty. I ordered the lamb medium rare and it came raw and purple. My wife ordered the sixteen spice chicken which was sickly sweet. Tried the cioppino...it was edible at best. Overly fishy smelling in general with mussels that were certainly past their prime. Overall, the food was overly sweet and generally bad.\n\nIf you want to experience a good $100 plus meal in vegas don't eat here. There are much better places worth your time and money. I recommend B & B Ristorante in the Venetian."

We split the blue tortilla duck and shrimp tamale appetizers, which were quite good. We both ordered the coffee-coated tenderloin, which turned out to be fork-tender and a slight but pleasant kick from the ancho sauce. Desserts were nothing to write home about; the chocolate pudding tasted like something from out of the can and the coconut cake definitely had been baked earlier in the week, frozen and then thawed for the weekend rush. We'll probably go back for a special occasion - it's a bit pricey; our waiter said Mondays tend to be the best night, less crowded. It's also very very noisy and you're elbow to elbow with the next table, very reminiscent of New York City restaurants."

I usually only eat chicken and here they had only one dish!!! They had a ton of meat and a lot of fish. The entree prices are 25$ and up. We ordered a few apps: the shrimp tamale, the chicken tacos, the chorizo meatballs, and some salads.\n\nOk so heres the rundown!\n\nThe apps: ok so for 12$-18$ for apps I expect not just 1 tamale or 3 small balls... But this is what you get. The chorizo had a smooth texture, which I am not used to, and were sooo small! Basically each of the 6 of us got half a ball. We also had to share 1 measly tamale and 3 chicken skewers and soft tortillas... Ahh! \n\nDinner: I ordered 16 spice chicken. I noticed that the sides were 8$ each... What!? Whatever we ended.up ordering 2 mashed potatos which to me were creamy and bland &Some brussel sprouts. My chicken came and it was a piece of dark and light rubbed in what seemed like adobo spices. I tried it and it def needed salt imo and towards the middle it looked a little pink so I stopped eating it. Sad face for sure. I ended up just eating some jalapeno bread and the dark piece.\n\nMy gringo friends love it here; I am not a fan. Its a small amount of food for the price which was whatever.

Despite most negative opinions of celebrity chefs, I think many of them can cook well. Personally, I enjoyed dining at Mesa Grill. \n\nMy friend and I came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. We were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service. There was a complimentary bread basket which I was very impressed with and a wide selection of water, YES WATER, to chose from. So service receives 5 stars. Based on the number of parties I saw in the restaurant, reservations are probably not necessary for lunch or brunch. But it might be otherwise for dinner.\n\nWe started off with Chef Flay's famous Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale. I think this appetizer was definitely true to Flay's southwestern stile and is a must try. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet; corn tamale was fresh and fluffy and the his signature sauces were extremely flavorful. Each bite has a familiar spice kick.\n\nThen, we ordered the BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad and the Eggs + Aged Strip Loin Tortilla. The cobb salad and lamb were divine! I loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  The tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) However, I was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings. Honestly, I could have gone without the egg and myriad of relishes (very beautifully plated) because the strip loin was cooked really well (medium rare, which I think is how all good meat should be cooked). It was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. I will definitely have to come back for dinner to try his Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin.\n\nALSO, I LOVED the complimentary bread basket. The waiter describes what each bread piece is and each was delicious on its own. :)"

I love how Bobby Flay gives classic dishes an interesting twist that makes the dishes a delightful surprise. Needless to say when in Caesar's, Mesa is a Must."

Almost all the dishes I had here were drawn with sauces, I think the sauce should enhance the dish not over powering it. The only dish I would recommend is the Spicy Chicken+ Sweet Potato Hash on their brunch menu@ $16.50(with Avocado, Tomato, Maytag Blue Cheese + Buttermilk Serrano Dressing), the dish was very nicely presented and was also hearty and filling. The other good thing here is their complimentary mini blue corn breads.\n\nI sincerely feel that the chefs at this location should step up to the plate, and really refine their dishes and cooking skills, inorder to meet the standard of the one in NYC."

The food if just amazing. \nI ordered the duck with a carrot and habenero sauce, and please do not be afraid of the almighty pepper. It was mild. The duck was cooked to perfection, it melted in your mouth. The tamale that is served along side it was dry, and odd combo. It was a goat cheese, chorizo tamale. Just order the corn, you will want to eat gallons of it. Keep the tamale do NOT ask to substitute, pet PEEVE of any chef. Its a major no no. \nMy friend had the salmon with black bean puree, with garnish of cilantro, the salmon was good medium rare and it was juicy, flaky and extremely flavorful. The ingredients used in all of his recipes are fresh and full of flavor. \nAnother person ordered the chicken, chicken is boring to order at restaurants cause it can be over cooked, bland, or dry. However B-Flay knew how to master that chicken! It was crispy skinned, juicy succulent meat, and the most mouth watering crust. It had a bite as well as a smokey flavor through out the dish. The chicken was served along side mashed potatoes with cilantro pesto. TO DIE FOR I tell you, now if you were like me you were thinking cilantro in mashed potatoes, dont question just eat. Trust me! \nAs for drinks, dont be afraid to ask the server what he recommends for your drink give him an idea of what you like, what food you might order and man do they know their stuff. \nI had a white peach margarita that was sensational. Hold the salt too please. The white peach was actually a white peach no fake stuff, this was the real deal. The color looked like an ending sunset, garnished with a lime and served in a cute glass. \nFor dessert i did not order one but I did however have a dessert drink. It was a passion fruit Bellini. Completed the meal and tied all the flavors together while cleaning my pallet. \nAs for the service, I have never received such great service. I say this because in Vegas, serves were rude, short, inexperienced and didn't know the menu. B-Flay has got his workers TRAINED! We were wearing black dresses and were given white napkins, they removed them and said, \"Ladies we want to give you black ones so you dont get lint on your dresses,\" Thank you B-Flay. Thank you serves for having your shit together and knowing how to treat guests. Five stars all around."

And the food did not disappoint, so I'll start there.  My husband and I like to try and split multiple dishes, so here's what we had:\n\nBlue Corn Lobster Tacos - perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  These were tiny, but so good!\n\nGoat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\" - rich, creamy, and delicious.  This was one of my favorites!\n\nBlue Corn Crusted Halibut - perfectly seasoned, flakey, sauce with a bit of heat - it was everything I had wished it would be.\n\nSide of Cilantro Pesto Mashed Potatoes - amazing.  The flavor combination was delicious and they were creamy and rich and amazing.\n\nSide of Corn - this was probably our favorite.  The flavors were amazing.  You have to get the side of corn.\n\nWe also had two Cactus Pear Margaritas that were just the right amount of sweet and a relief from all of the watered down cocktails we'd been finding all over Vegas.\n\nSo here's the bad.  Our server was horrible.  We love to get recommendations and find out more about the food and our server seemed annoyed when we asked what the best dishes were.  He barely spoke to us the entire meal.  We sat for 10 minutes with empty plates in front of us while we watched him chat with a co-worker in the middle of the dining room floor.  Our bread basket stayed on our table until the check came, which made it impossibly cluttered.  We explained we would be splitting meals, but we had to ask for separate plates.  When he did finally come to clean our table, he did not say one word the entire time.  Never asked how our food was.  Never came over during the meal to check in.  It was not just bad service, it was awkward.  All we could do was laugh it was so bad.\n\nThe worst part was that it seems like our server was the odd man out.  All over the restaurant we could hear other tables receiving excellent service and menu advice and attention.  The staff that checked us in and greeted us was great.  The people who ran our food out and bussed some of our dishes were polite and friendly.  It seems like we just got the bad egg, but it really did ruin the experience I was so excited about.\n\nAll in all, I will still give this place a high rating because I really do think the service is not universally bad.  And the food was amazing.  If the service had matched the food this could have been one of the highlights of the trip.  I still love Bobby - I just think he needs to let this server go."

I had the Lamb Porterhouse with Tamale and sides of Spinach and Sweet Potatoes. All was delicious - we first sat at the bar to wait for table. Bad thing no draught beers here - only bottles. The bartender handed us breadsticks, which had a nice spicy element. After a 45 minute wait, we finally were taken to our table. The waiter was nice however did not give us the lowdown on the fare, as a typical establishment of this type is expected to - maybe he was too busy?  When the food arrived, the lamb was cooked a little under, however seasoned well and had a nice spicy kick from the serrano peppers on top. The sweet poatatoes were sweet and had a nice firm bite, not hard or raw. The spinach also was good.\n\nOverall the food was good but not impressive as you would an Iron Chef restaurant to be."

Here are my recommendations:\n \nAppetizers:\n-Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamales - Oh my gosh! The tamales just melted in your mouth topped off with a cilantro sauce. \n-Blue Corn Pancake - All I wanted to do is to love the Bbq duck down since it was soft and tender infused with the Habanero Chile sauce. \n\nMain Course:\n-22 oz Bone In Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye with a red and green chile Sauce - You know when you come to Bobby's place you have to order a meat dish. In the words of Usher, all I can say is \"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, You make me wanna say, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh My goshh!\" The meat was Orgasmic, juicy with lots of flavor from the chipotle glaze. \n-Pork Tenderloin had a nice rub and the meat was tender and flavorful. The roasted tomato tamale with key lime butter complimented the dish.\n\nSide Dish:\n-Roasted Corn with Grill Cactus, Lime, and Cotija\n\nAll the flavors combined in your mouth will have your taste buds dancing to the tunes of Usher's song \"OMG!\""

When my fiance mentioned he had a place in Vegas, there was no hesitation on my part to go their for lunch.  I know another reviewer (Chris O) had a terrible experience this week but for my fiance and I..it was wonderful.\n\nThe location is in Caesar's Palace.  The smart thing they did here was enclose the restaurant in glass so those noisey gambling machines do not interfere with your eating.  The wait staff are sharply  dressed in pin strip vests and gray shirts.  Our waiter and bus/getting-the-bread-to-the-table guy both were well informed about the specials.  The \"bread guy\" even explained the type of bread we were about to consume.  What other restaurant does that?!  My fiance ordered the Mesa burger and I ordered the chicken skewered tacos.  Both were absolutely delicious.  What I liked most of the tacos were their portion sizes.  Perfect for lunch so would not feel \"stuffed\".  I forgot to mention they had a peach martini.  Very tasty and cute.  My fiance said he wished we had taken pictures of our food prior to eating.  We shared plates and the burger was quite juicy and thick.  Be careful of the ketchep.  Bobby found a way to spice that up too!  The fries were phenomenal.  Sorry Chris O but I have to totally disagree with you here.\n\nMesa Grill is a place you should NOT avoid.  If you are in town for business and want a place to have a lunch meeting, Mesa Grill fits the bill.  Also a great place for couples."

We got an appetizer of the Tiger Shrimp & Garlic Corn Tamale.  It was awesome!  We could have eaten several more.  The sweet corn is so tasty and the sauce is incredible.\n\nFor our entrees, we split the Chile Relleno and the Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash.  Both were very good.  The chile Relleno covering was crunchier than I am used to, but all the tastes blended well and the cheese just melted.  The hash was very different, but quite tasty.  It was pieces of chicken and sweet potatoes basically mashed into wash other and covered by eggs and hollandaise sauce.  I was a big fan of both dishes.  \n\nI couldn't resist dessert even though I really had no room.  We had the Layered Coconut Cake.  Scrumptious!  I would describe it as a tiramisu with coconut flavor, rather than a coffee-like flavor.  The cakes were soaked in some kind of cream like a tiramisu. It was great!"

The margaritas were excellently prepared. Delicious and fresh. On to the food. The bread basket was delectable. Try the corn muffins, you won't want to to stop. I had the chili rubbed pork medallions that were seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. This dish was an absolute winner. The chili rellenos were a miss. Coating or breading was heavy and hard. I wouldn't let this stop me from going at all, just skip this dish. Tuna was good according to the person in our party who had it though why? in  Bobby Flay restaurant? I'm not sure.

The Especial Margarita, with a Gand Mariner floater was top notch, according to my wife, the perfect Margarita snob. I had the Bitter Frenchie, a grapefruit drink that you should never mistake for a Margarita! So, along comes the moment of truth for my son, who is torn between so many items - the waiter staring him down for a food order. I told the waiter that my son eats everything, and especially appreciates creativity in food. The waiter didn't miss a beat - \"Do you like lamb?\" \"Yes!\" \"Order the lamb porterhouse!\" \"Yes! Medium rare!\" When it arrived, My son took one bite, his eyes grew big and he smiled. Best lamb ever! I tasted it. No gaminess. Slight char. A light layer of delicious Argentinian chimichurri and just enough tiny slivers of cooked serrano peppers to give it a little punch. Quite possibly as delicious and perfect as any steak anywhere! Seriously. The lamb was served with a plantain tamale which, like at most restaurants, had way too much corn masa and not nearly enough filling. My wife & I ordered the banana cream pie dessert. Creatively done. No real crust, just a sliver thin cookie crust-like layer balanced on top of the pie filling. Not too sweet. Very good, but not overly memorable. Overall, Mesa is definitely worth going back for to see what other interesting things they have in store for us."

A bread basket was brought to the table that held an assortment of different types of breads. The server was attentive and open to give suggestions. Brian went with the cornmeal crusted chile relleno made with roasted eggplant, manchego cheese sweet red pepper sauce, and balsamic vinegar.  The server stated that it was one of the smaller meals on the menu, but it wasn't really that small at all. It was quite a bit of food. Brian said that it tasted phenomenal and was extremely happy with his choice. I picked the mahi mahi served over creamy green chile rice, yellow pepper mole, cilantro and green chile vinaigrette. This was honestly the best mahi I have ever had in my entire life.  It was amazing. Everything about the dish was perfect. I don't think I could have gone with a better choice.

            "review": "We kicked off Restaurant Week 2010 at Mesa Grill. When we arrived at 5 o'clock there were very few diners, I'm pretty sure it was just us and two other couples. But as our meal went on the dining room quickly filled. We noshed on the bread basket while we waited for our appetizers, the blue corn muffin wasn't too appealing the bottom looked moldy. The fruit bread was the favorite, and I expected to like it least.\n\nThen, we got started on our first course: Roasted Corn Soup Smoked Tomato Salsa and Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The soup was decent it had an unusual hint of flavor, I thought squash maybe, but my husband thought it tasted more like seafood. Obviously, we weren't on the same page. The blue corn pancake and duck were very tasty. Again, the blue corn does nothing for its appearance.\n\nFor the main course we had Blue Corn Crusted Halibut with Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, jalapeno, Fresh Oregano, Basil and New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon -Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter. The fish was nicely prepared, the presentation was different - thanks to the blue corn it looked liked it had asphalt glistening off the filet. The pork was flavorful as long as you had the crust in every bite. The tamale was unlike your traditional tamale, still tasty, however.\n\nLastly we finished with Coconut Layer Cake and Banana Cream Pie. Both were good, but nothing particularly memorable.\n\nService was very good throughout the meal. All in all, it was a fine meal, it's just that nothing was particularly notable. I can't say I'd return, but I'm happy we took the opportunity to finally give it a try."

Mesa Grill was on my radar before arriving in LV so my boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for dinner at around 9:30P on a Friday evening. I'm sure there's SOME room for walk-ins, but I would definitely make reservations in advance if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours. \n\nBobby Flay really put together an incredible menu from start to finish. We started out with the roasted tiger shrimp + corn tamale which kicked off the meal perfectly. All the flavors in the dish just worked together perfectly. We opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on the roasted corn and the cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. The corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a MUST if you're ordering a side. The chile was great, though didn't quite have the same impact. Being a pescetarian, the tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. A surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. I should say though that we had entirely too much food. We could have JUST had our entrees and I would have been satisfied. One app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry. By the end of the meal I was at the point where I was beyond full but couldn't seem to stop munching because it was SO good! Dessert wasn't even an option for us after over-ordering. When you pop in keep in mind that the portions are actually pretty good-sized (which is a pleasant surprise) and order accordingly. All around amazing. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas!"

We tried many items, and neither the service nor most of the items were even average.\nFirst, there are at least 20 people working in the front of the restaurant, and not once did any of them smile ever. I watched the entire staff and they seemed distant at best.\nOK so first the food. Ordered nine dishes and only was was any good. Blue corn tamale, Chile releno, and cauliflower gratin all underflavored. The sweet potato casserole was marginal.\nThe romaine salad was described to have chorizo sausage. Only one dime sized slice appeared on the plate.\nThe lobster tacos were fantastic, although a very small portion for almost 20 bucks.\nWe arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and the manager was reluctant to seat us even though the place was half empty. He originally said we'd have to wait until closer to the reservation time.\nI came here 2 years ago and had a great dinner. (See prior review.) Not sure what happened but it looks like the place is more touristy.\nSad to have had this experience."

My wife and I were lucky enough to get to go this year and I practically packed a fork and knife in anticipation. \n\nMesa Grill was the first restaurant we tried on the trip. I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Tamale for an appetizer and it absolutely hit the spot. The flavor was extremely bold, and I literally used my spoon to scrape the remaining sauce from the plate. Delicious.\n\nFor the main course I decided to try the pork tenderloin sandwich and I absolutely loved the combination on the plate. I love to combine my food, and I recommend putting the fries in the sandwich as you eat. By the way, the pork is served cold and medium rare, which the waiter warns you about in advance. For this reason, I don't understand fellow yelpers complaining that the sandwich was not hot, or undercooked.\n\nMy only small complaint would be I didn't like the corn bread served before the meal.\n\nAfter it was all said it done, we ended up going to the Mesa Grill two out of the three days. This is no small fact considering we could eat wherever we wanted. I now find myself having dreams about that pork tenderloin sandwich. Loved that sauce.\n\nRecommended."

We went to Mesa Grill. \n\nI know he's supposed to be known for his burgers and what not, so I ordered the Mesa burger, which came with seasoned fries. They bring a basket of bread to your table as you sit down, there's raisin bread, jalepeno bread and corn bread. I've been having a corn bread craving for a while and his was jam packed with jalepenos and corn, which is nice, but it lacked that buttery good moistness I'm used to in cornbread. The regular Jalepeno bread was yummy. I even tried the raisin bread even though I don't particularly care for raisins, it was good, nothing outstanding. \n\nFinally my burger came. And I was excited. The fries looked well seasoned, only to find out that they're really well seasoned in the middle of the bowl but as you moved outwards it became blander. And there was no salt and pepper on the table, I understand the reasoning that if it's cooked well you don't need salt and pepper. But I kind of needed salt and pepper.  The fries were crisp and had a great crunch. The burger itself was very juicy. Cheese, onions, spicy mustard on the side, ketchup also on the side, trying to get the condiments in was a hassle so I ended up dipping smaller pieces. Overall, good burger, hearty, filling, comforting. Can I get a better one for less than 16$, Absolutely. \n\nHOWEVER, I will absolutely give Bobby this, that his staff is fantastically trained. Our waiter went out of his way to take pictures of our table for us, going up to the rotisserie, taking pictures from the level above us, etc. It was very nice of him, he even offered us a free cappuccino after finding out we're college students (thus probably weren't going to order it anyway because of funds). He took really good care of us throughout our meal. So good job there, Bobby but might want to have a look see at your food"

It was so rich we only ate about 25% of it. \n\nMy husband ordered a breakfast enchilada and I ordered the bacon and hash brown quesadilla (off the appetizer side of the menu). In both items, the tortilla was too hard, undercooked, and heavy tasting. My husband's food tasted no different than normal breakfast food (just eggs and chorizo inside). Mine was disgusting- too much goat cheese grilled on the top, not enough bacon inside (hardly any) and the hash brown with the tortillas didn't taste right at all (bad combination but I thought it might taste ok). \n\nMy experience has been that all of the newer places in Vegas have tasted great- because they are still establishing themselves. The other places that have been around for a while no longer care to maintain themselves and have been mediocre to disappointing. The only exception to that has been Nobu.\n\nI wish we would have gone to Mon Ami Gabi or one of the high end buffets at Bellagio or the Wynn instead- it would have cost the same and no doubt tasted better!"

The decorations were fine and I liked the set-up. We had reservations and we were seated very promptly. The tables were decent sized.  The server was attentive, but sometimes way too much. I understand fine dining, but you don't want a pushy server. She was just overly attentive. I dug the way she threw in the merchandise they sell at the restaurant.  It's a hard thing to do at a fine dining place.\n\nThe menu... I personally thought the appetizers they had available were mediocre at best. I'd like more of a selection. We ended up with the Queso Fundido and it didn't disappoint. Even the bread that came out beforehand was quite yummy. I liked the cranberry type one.\n\nFor their entree's I was happy with the selections they offered. I was kind of stuck between the Salmon and the chicken. I usually don't order chicken when I eat out, but this time. It just sounded very good. WE both got it and wow. It's this 16 spice rubbed chicken with pest mash potatoes. It knocked my socks off! It was sooo good. And the portions were overwhelming. I got 2 acutal chicken breasts. I couldn't believe that! The 16 spice rub was delicious. The mash potatoes were delicious. I can't complain.\n\nWe took home half of our meal because we were stuffed. We skipped dessert.  There was no way I could eat any more.\n\nI'm buying the 16 spice rub online at their store - that's how much I liked it.  Ate the chicken the next day - still good, but a little dry. I can't complain.\n\nI'd go back!"

I went in with my guy and we had a great experience, even sitting at the bar for our meal. Sidenote: those bartenders are on point constantly squeezing fresh limes and shakin' up martinis.\n\nPRICKLY PEAR CACTUS MARGARITA: It's bright pink. That was my reminder that this is the same marg they have on the menu at Bobby's Burger Palace. It's fresher here, and my BF really enjoyed it, but I would have picked the white peach version instead.\nLOBSTER TACOS: $20 for a trio of mini tacos, super fresh and flavorful. The blue corn tortillas are a nice touch, and there was a good amount of acidity. Wish there were more seafood options on the menu.\nCORNMEAL CRUSTED CHILE RELLENO: My main complaint about usual chile rellenos is that they are overbreaded. Using cornmeal negates this issue! The chile is large and packed full of manchego cheese and roasted eggplant, served in a roasted red pepper sauce with balsamic vinegar. I really enjoyed this and would get it again! \nCHARRED POBLANO SWEET PEA RISOTTO: DUHLUSHUS. I didn't pick this and didn't expect it to be very good. I inhaled it. Subtle flavors, great texture, creamy and comforting. \nPISTACHIO BROWN BUTTER CAKE: The cake initially seemed dry, but upon combining the ingredients of the dish, this seemed to be a strategic decision. Bites that combined the ginger caramel, white peach ice cream, and/or fresh fruit were artfully balanced.\n\nIf you are considering this spot to dinner, I highly recommend reservations: I popped by on a whim on a Wednesday evening at 6PM and they were full until 9PM. I lucked out and sat on the couches to order a drink and two spots opened up at the bar right away."

My Husband and I didn't get a chance to go last time we were in town, so I cancelled a reservation I had at another restaurant (big mistake) to go here.\n\nThe night started off well with nice and professional hostesses and the decor is really cool and interesting but that's about where the good ended. Our server Sheldon was absolutely horrible. A server can easily make or break a meal, and Sheldon really hit the nail in the coffin for us. We didn't see him for the first 10 minutes or so after sitting down, and then he came over to take our order. No introduction, small talk or overview of the menu or specials. Nothing. We then didn't see him until he was ready to give us the check. I say when he was ready to give us the check because it took about 10 minutes for that to come after we were done eating. He never even checked on us during our meal. Not once. No smiles or friendliness or anything. So disappointing to spend good money on a meal and get Taco Bell service.\n\nI'm a Vegetarian so I ordered the one Vegetarian entree on the menu; the Chili Rellano. It was pretty bad. It was colorful, but very very bland. I could tell Bobby Flay www trying to be creative with the different sauces, but nothing worked together. Everything was very weird and I suffered through a few bites. Yuck.\n\nMy Husband had their Sweet Potato Clam Chowder which he thought was OK, and the Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which he suffered getting through as well. The pork was tough and not a good cut, and the tamale that came with it he couldn't even eat. We also ordered the Cilantro Pesto Mashed Potatoes which were just that, mashed potatoes with some pesto. Lame.\n\nWe will never come back. The entire meal was so disappointing. I want my $100 and hour of my life back. The only reason I gave it two stars is it didn't make us sick."

Few options on the menu but what you get is always good (and you expect the fewer the choices the closer to perfection...and you would be correct).  The service was good, the food was cooked to perfection (the salmon and even the chicken were moist and full of flavor).  You need reservations or you will be waiting a while (it's Vegas).

Usually we eat cheap (because we lose and have to dish it out at clubs) or we go to the buffets for the grand experience.\n\nThis will be the first of many.\n\nWe went in a party of 7 around 530 to beat a rush (if any). Though there dress code is pretty casual, sleeves are a must (no bro tanks here). We had a reservation that was made a couple days prior and got seated right when the last one of us had arrived. We were greeted by our waiter who pretty much gave us the lowdown on the menu. As someone on our group said, there probably could have been a whole powerpoint presentation on the information he gave us. \n\nNo complaints about the service. Waiter came around early and often. He even brought backup just to refill water.\n\nFood: Was great. To be honest, I haven't tried pricey steaks so often but that New York strip was good. I tried my friend's rib-eye and DO RECOMMEND that one over the strip. Overall, you're paying that much for a steak so it better be good, right? We also started with the blue corn pancake (with duck inside). I would have liked to be bigger, but it seems like its a trend that the appetizers are appetizer size. The duck was very tender and flavorful though. I do recommend the tamale. It will be unlike any tamale you have ever eaten...trust me on that one. As for a side, the waiter recommended the roasted corn chipotle aioli which was fantastic. \n\nPrice: Well it's Bobby Flay. \"Pay him. Pay him his money\"\n\nBobby Flay did it right. Iron Chef, we'll meet again someday."

I expected something along the lines of a gastronomic orgasm, but mustve chosen the wrong item on the menu. \n\nApple salad with bleu cheese - delicious, but beware: the bleu cheese flavor is extra strong. If you enjoy strong cheeses like me, however, you'll definitely enjoy this dish. \n\nCoffee crusted steak sandwich - the name screams flavor. Unfortunately, the only flavor I could taste was the onion. I was greatly disappointed with the coffee crusted steak because there was absolutely no coffee flavor. The sandwich was unimpressive and something I could make at home. \n\nPork tenderloin sandwich - now THIS is the sandwich to get. It is much tastier than the steak sandwich. The flavor were much better. I also heard from the table next to me that the Cuban burger was the best burger they have ever had. \n\nThe chicken hash (not sure of the exact name but it had egg hollandaise on it) - the best dish on the table. The flavours melded together beautifully and I would get this dish if I return. \n\nThe fries that came with the sandwiches were good. Very salty though. \n\nThe bread and the corn muffin was super delicious. I would definitely come back for lunch because the prices were okay and not too obnoxious. I would recommend this place but do NOT order the steak sandwich."

We grill all year round and have enjoyed Bobby's grilling book as well as Food Network shows. \n\nThe decor is warm and open. The bartender was great and our waitress Tiffany was awesome and attentive. Some of the best service I have ever experienced. This is including the bus boy.\n\nWe started with the Prawn Tamale appetizer which was cooked to perfection. The masa corn mix was perfectly flavored.\n\nI ordered the 15 spice chicken with mango salsa. This was tender and a large portion. My sides were mashed potatoes and the blue cheese corn side which was so so so delicious.\n\nI had a view of the kitchen, it was hard for me to tell how the dishes are transfered from the kitchen to the wait staff, it looked confusing to me. Last time we were here something happened and while I was served my pork loin dish after 20 minutes and my hubby was served his steak dish which turned cold. Its almost as if another waiter took my dish for another table at the time and his dish sat awhile. \n\nThey handled the situation well at the time.

They must cook in a volcano, because the steak had a nice crust with the middle just barely warm ...22oz of awesomeness is what that was. The meat was tender and every bite wasn't saying \"beef\", it was screaming with neon signs..that is an awesome steak, my hat off to you Mr. Flay. We ask the waiter if the mashed potatoes (with a green chile white cheese sauce) could be shared, he said yes... no you can't share it..for one, it's a small side and 2 its too goo to share..you will want that bad boy all by yourself. I also had the roasted corn soup, my only complaint is that it's too small. It has a smoke chile flavor (not spicy) that balances well with the sweetness of cream. I've normally avoided \"celebrity chef\" restaurants in the past, thinking it was all hype. Mesa Grill changed that for me. The 3 items above plus 2 jack and coke came up to $128... not cheap by any stretch, but well worth the flavor explosion."

This, coming from someone who usually HATES hot & spicy dishes!! You can taste that jalapeno flavor and notice that very tiny kick, but I wouldn't consider it spicy at all. The 2nd runner up for bread: Blue Corn muffin - this was the first to disappear at my table of 6 before we discovered the jalapeno bread.\n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the Spicy Tuna & Salmon Tartares served w/ Red & Green Hot Sauces, Crispy Plantains +Blue Corn Flatbread. Who would've thought to serve the fish tartare on plantains?? Being spoiled by the Blue Corn muffin already, I looked forward to the flatbread version - it wasn't a disappointment. ;-) As for the sauces, they were both \"mild\" (FYI: my threshold is \"mild\" to begin with...) at best and gives the tuna/salmon that extra kick when eaten w/ plantains. I never thought Spicy Tuna & Salmon Tartare can be THIS good prepped Tex-Mex style.....\n\nI gotta hand it to the guy, he sure knows know to make a damn good Lamb Chop Cobb Salad, as this was my main lunch entree. Now, I do realize that everyone is a fan of lamb. Me? I love dark meat (no pun intended!) and some of that \"game\" taste. The lamb was cooked a little too well for me, I usually prefer my meats prepared medium. Fresh greens were nice and crunchy. And they didn't skimp out on the avocado! Buttermilk dressing was the perfect amount - not too little and not too much where the dressing would overpower the taste of the dish.\n\nAs for dessert, most of us didn't bother since lunch was filling and we had to wait for the rest of our friends to arrive in Vegas for dinner that night. Next time, I'll have to convince my friends to come back here to check out their dinner menu."

Mesa Grill has a reputation for its food having rich, Southwestern flavors, and its impeccable service. \n\nAppetizers - Sophie's Chopped Salad: Not the best introduction to my dining experience, only because the salad had chickpeas and olives -- not a fan of these -- that weren't mentioned on the menu. A coworker had me try her Blue Corned Pancake with Barbecued Duck, now that was good! If I hadn't known it was duck, I would've thought the meat was pork. \n\nMain Course - Smoked Shrimp Tacos: Our waiter praised these tacos and strongly encouraged me to order them, which I'm glad I did. Along with the tacos there were three condiments: guacamole, tomatillo salsa, and a mango habanero salsa that wasn't burn-your-tongue-off spicy. The shrimps tasted fresh and were well-seasoned that the sauces were unnecessary and just made eating a little messier --- the mango habanero salsa will make your white napkin turn orange before you're done with your meal.\n\nDessert - Chef's Choice Chocolate Pudding: A chocolate pudding topped with chocolate mousse, topped with chocolate toffee -- yep, that's a lot of chocolate! The pudding reminded me of the Jello pudding cups that you can buy at the grocery store. Adding more chocolate toffee pieces or even some fresh berries would've saved the dessert from being just average. \n\nService - Exceptional and attentive.\n\nOverall - Even though there were some slight disappointments with the food, they're not enough to discourage me from returning."

But with my most recent experience, Mesa Grill definitely deserves 5 stars!\n\nThe first time, I had their coffee rubbed filet mignon. It sounds more interesting than it tastes. As in, it was kind of bland. I know you're not supposed to ask for sauce with your steak (and trust me- I don't like sauce with my steak) but I was seriously contemplating taking my steak back to my hotel room so I may secretly add A1 sauce. \n\nThe second time around, I ordered the snapper. My opinion of the place went up significantly. Not because of the snapper, but because I had a bite out of my sister's rib eye!!! BOY OH BOY! It was like melted gold on my tongue. This piece of cow melted in my mouth and slithered its own way all the way down my tummy. There it lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality. \n\nMy last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about the infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- the grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at the huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of the grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of the rib-eye and deemed the grouper the best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but the rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct. And may Bobby Flay's minion chefs continue cooking you. \n\nThe end."

We canceled so we could eat at Mesa Grill again. \n\nYes Bobby Flay is all over Food Network, but he cooks to the flavor profile we prefer (and he's disdainful of Rachel Ray which makes me happy because she annoys the heck out of me). \n\nAmbiance: Modern with an nod to the Old West.

He could speak intelligently about the menu in the way a hardcore foodie or critic could (an accomplishment in an establishment that frequently changes their menu). He was present when you wanted him, an absent when you wanted some privacy. He was awesome. \n\nFood: Sex on a plate. In the realm of appetizers we had pumpkin soup and a lovely tartar plate of tuna and salmon with these AMAZING sauces. For entrees we had a 44 spice rubbed steak, lamb, chicken, and pork - all perfectly prepared and exquisitely seasoned. One of my favorite bites was a side dish of a sweet potato and chile tamale. \n\nPricing: Not cheap, but worth every dime. I've paid more for less enjoyable fare.

Loaded with roasted  poblano , pickled onions and Mexican cheese makes this the best burger on the planet. It's flavor profile is indescribable . The southwest fries was icing on the cake . This food has hat eclectic South west flair . Don't miss this place not coz of the food but coz Bobby is best !"

The caviar-topped oyster appetizer (on special, won't be there long -- go now!) was honestly the best thing I think I've ever eaten in my life. I could eat 100 of those. I ordered the Cioppino for my main course and it was crazy good --  huge pieces of fresh seafood, amazing broth flavor. My husband ordered the tuna and it was also excellent (though, I think mine won). We both had margaritas and then I had wine and he had beer, all excellent. \n\nThe servers were amazing -- yes, plural. We had at least four come to our table for different purposes, all were super friendly and helpful (and funny!). They made us feel really welcome and taken care of. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Even though it was packed, with the extreme height of the ceilings, it wasn't overly loud and my date and I could easily hear each other. We will definitely be making a return visit to this restaurant next time we're in Vegas. Thanks, Bobby Flizzal. :)"

Cloyingly sweet. Boyfriend's shrimp tacos were way too spicy & the sauces served with were way too sweet. Really wanted to love this place because I love Bobby's recipes, but it fell flat. If you just get a couple drinks (maybe not the peach margarita, which was my fault for ordering when everything else was too sweet), get the free bread & appetizers. I would go back for just that, but not for the \"real\" food... Sorry Bobby!"

He should be grateful he's never met me in person.\n\nBut, when going on a celebrity chef tour, you can't reject Bobby Flay. This is the greatest excuse for me to talk shit. We walked in and his books with all his smiles welcomed us. Yes, buy my books before you sit down. \n\nThe interior is nice and fiery, a visual representation of what he wants his food to be. It's all good and all, but what the hell is up with the bar being a completely different color scheme and even art style that clashes so horribly with the rest of the place? Another freshly graduated interior designer, it seems. \n\n\"MESA\" is the big name you see no matter where you're sitting, in an oddly half-cut big block lettering. Nick commented \"I wonder if anyone told Bobby that half his letters are missing.\" The logo makes no sense with the interior design either, all of which just says to me \"failure\".\n\nI did not keep the receipt but I still remember a good part of the meal.\n\nTiger shrimp tamales, an appetizer, is an absolute must in trying Bobby's food. It is an absolute must because he always makes it. So you have to eat it, because it is his signature dish. Obviously it is his favorite, so he better do this right. And it is good. I'd hate to say it, but it's a well-made tamale. Sure not exactly Mexican, but it tastes pretty good. It had all of two shrimps. A spicy mayo sauce is gooped onto it. \n\nA ceviche turned out to be leftover bits of grouper fish tossed in lemon juice. The fish was nice and fresh, but that ain't ceviche. \n\nTwo different fish dishes were decent, good ingredients prepared by good workers. Such a pitiful thing that Bobby does is overpower everything by drowning them in sauces. You don't really taste the meat, you taste the sauce. And Tony Bourdain was right. You can tell all too easily that the sauces came out of squeeze bottles. And before then they came out of blenders. Something... that just kills the cooking essense of cooking.\n\nThe dessert was at least very good, worth going to Bobby's for. Warm chocolate crepes with strawberries, with plenty of warm goopy sauce around it.\n\nThe best part of the meal, and I've had too many experiences like this at \"fine dining\" places, was the free bread that was passed around. Corn bread with actual corn chunks (to remind you that you're eating corn bread), was a bit more crumbly than I would like (it just means crumbs everywhere!!) but it did have the corn flavor goodness. With warm butter (although that made it crumblier) it was better.\n\nI watched a steak being served to another table, and the load of peppers and sauce on top of it made me cringe. As we left the books bid us farewell."

Our waiter saw us waiting and did not seem to care.\n\nI ordered a steak. I was told this restaurant was known for great steaks. What I received was a piece of meat so tough and tasteless it was beyond poor. It was so hard to chew I only ate part of it. At no time did the waiter inquire if our food was satisfactory because, had he done so, I would have made my dissatisfaction clear.\n\nAs I said this was my first visit and I don't plan to return.

I'm already a fan of Bobby Flay who seems to be on everything on Food Network nowadays. The stars and reviews built up my excitement...and then I heard from friends of friends that it sucked. I was a little scared that it really would suck and I'd curse Bobby Flay with every ounce of my being (like when I tried to come here on my last trip and they closed early to redo the floors).\n\nBetter half and I arrived here for brunch over Memorial Day weekend. We had our reservations about how much I'd like the place seeing as how I die if I lick a hot cheeto. Lots of things say spicy this...spicy that..spicy everything. In my head, I tell myself to toughen up and just try it...then I wimped out and went with a blue corn waffle. I ordered a cactus pear iced tea along with it since I was a bit curious. Boyfriend ordered spicy scrambled eggs sans goat cheese. The waiter gave him a bit of grief over it..saying he would check with the chef if that was allowed..asking if he didn't like it or if he was allergic...yada yada. \n\nOur plates came out and the waffle is the size of my face. Actually, bigger. It comes with vanilla creme fraiche and blackberry bourbon syrup. I'm not a fan of blackberries but this was divine! All the flavors melded together wonderfully. It wasn't overly sweet and the waffle had a distinct flavor. I tried (and failed) to finish the whole thing but only ate 3/4s of it. They prepared the eggs to bf's liking, without cheese, and he said it was delicious! I looked over at his plate and it was quite green from the onions and pleeenty of jalapeno. I didn't even attempt a bite. The tea was quite refreshing. It had a light flavor that contrasts how bitter tea can get. No need for sweetener here.\n\nOverall a pleasant experience. It didn't disappoint and I don't have to curse Bobby Flay every time I see him on Food Network. A nice change for brunch with its southwestern flare. It was definitely worth the wait!"

However, the guy shows up on a bunch of different shows, which makes me wonder...is it just a persona he puts up?  I mean, he must be a decent guy to get himself on so many spots on the Food Network, right?  If it is just an act though, it works; his brash personality actually made me want to try his cooking even more, just so I could see if he's as good as his reputation suggests.  And being that the MESA in NY was his first restaurant, my friends and I figured this would the perfect chance to check out his cooking.  \n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't squeeze MESA in for dinner, so we had to settle for fitting it in for brunch instead.  When our party of ten checked in with the hostess, we were seated promptly, where the wait staff was quick to start serving our table.  Our waiter was helpful with menu suggestions, and was pretty good at describing and explaining the different components of each plate.  In fact, when it was all said and done, I ended up going with one of his suggestions - the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles along with the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.\n\n- The Rough Cut Tuna Nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  The tuna is similar to Hawaiian poke, but with Southwestern flavors instead.  In a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  Much better.  Too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.\n\n- Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  Presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  With three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  The combination of flavors were fantastic.  If anything, I wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.\n\nIn addition, I also got a chance to try my friend's Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash, but I thought my entree was better.  Although I did like the spiciness and flavor, I would have like a little contrast in the texture.  Along with our meal, they also served a basket of bread, all with some Southwestern twists.  They were all decent, but my favorite of the bunch was the jalapeno bread.  \n\nIn the end, I'll give Flay his due...the guy can offer up a pretty good brunch menu.  The ones that I tried were great, though I know a few of my friends were not as enthralled with their orders (hence the four stars).  None of them said the dishes were bad though, so maybe it was just a case of hopeful expectations not being met.  Reviews on here are pretty high for dinner as well, so I'd be interested in checking that out next time.  At least now, I have another reason to go back to Vegas...not that I really needed another one anyways."

I swapped it for OJ instead and was much better. The iced tea has a subtle pear flavor.. I'd like a fruitier version instead. \n\nService was great but it was annoying to hear our server constantly being told to work faster to get people out. Her superior kept asking her what was going on with certain tables. Some people just take a while to order and I don't think it was right for her to be scolded for not having their orders in yet. \n\nOverall an okay experience.

YEP it was that close. \n\nSIDES: my bfs plate came with some kind of tamale - dry. I ordered the pumpkin spice tamale as a side: dry w/ too much star of anise. thats all I could taste. IT all sounds good in theory, but its not. I dont recall what else my bf ordered as a side... guess u could say it was forgettable. \n\nNo drinks or dessert and tab was $110. Nope.. could have had 2 awesome dinners elsewhere for that price, not including tip to the waitress who was great.  Felt kinda bad for the staff b/c they looked like ants in a farm - everyone doing something so dillitgently but there's so many- they must rely on tips that or thats why the prices are so high. \n\nAs I left couldnt help but wish I'd gone to one of the other restaurants in the Forum Shops. Hell, even Cheesecake factory tasted better. \nBut I give 3 stars - one for service, one for creativity for different tasting dishes. and 2 for ambiance. but I take away for having to practially sit in my neighbors chair with him (now I know who they watch on tv and who they are fans of in the NFL and why their daughter doesnt want to finish college) \n\nTIP#4)Oh yeah and if you dont make ur reservation (must cancel by 3PM) and if u dont make it or dont cancel its $50 a person !!\n\nTIP#5)if you are not a member of the caesars palace points thing - you have to give ur credit card info to even make that reservation so they can charge accordingly.  So its just as pricy to go as it is not to go."

Man!!! \n\nI also had a cactus pear iced tea...\n\nMy meal was pretty damn good and I expected it to be pretty damn good. \n\nBig ups to BF! Great restaurant, great food, great man."

I guess they are known for margaritas ($17), so I figured I would try one of those, I had them make it with Mezcal instead of tequila and it was really good (and strong).  \n\nThey give you a bread basket with a few different types of bread in it, all of them were good, but the best was this little muffin with blue cornmeal in it.  I could have ate about a dozen of those alone.  \n\nFor an entree I had the 16 spice chicken, it came pretty much deboned, minus one of the wings, over some mashed potatoes.  The dinner version of this was $36, but I would still say it was worth it. Not a place you are going to go eat at all the time, but if you are in town it's worth your time.  Sometimes these celebrity chef restaurants end up being a disappointment, but this place lived up to its repuation."

The New York Strip was fatty yet leather tough, overcooked, and with only a slight salty flavor - nothing I couldn't do at home.  The spicy chicken was average but was cooked well.  The blue corn pancake with barbecue duck was so  drowned in barbecue sauce I could not taste anything or enjoy the duck.  Also the pancake was paper thin and technically a crepe.  The sides were small, and the mashed potatoes were.....well, just plain mashed potatoes - nothing special.\n\nThe service was average.  The restaurant is right off the casino so be prepared to smell plenty of cigarette smoke as you try to enjoy your meal.   And, the tables are way too close for any sense of intimacy - be prepared to hear every word the adjacent table discusses and be prepared for them to hear your conversation as well.\n\nLastly, the desserts were great - otherwise this would have been a one star review.

Having never been to Vegas before, the location inside Caesar's Palace threw me off a bit. To me, Caesars Palace is just....tacky. But it's Vegas so that's the look they were going for I guess. \n\nAnyhow, they were of course totally booked so we ended up getting a seat at the bar. I thought this was actually better than sitting at a table and we had plenty of room. We started off with a White Pear Margarita which was easily the best (albeit relatively overpriced) cocktail I had in town. \n\nI wasn't particularly hungry but wanted to get a taste of the menu so I ended up getting a bunch of appetizers. The Barbecue Ribs were out of this world -- peanut chipotle sauce, garnished with some green onion and peanut relish. The Lobster Tacos were very yummy but so tiny. I was warned, but for 20 bucks I thought it'd be a bit bigger. Literally every bit of everything else was equally outstanding though.\n\n I would highly recommend making a reservation and not coming too hungry."

We went back for our table and were seating in about 5 minutes. The first thing I noticed was that the waiters- all of them- were men in their 40's or 50's. Seriously. Such a lack of diversity is bizarre. Doesn't seem like a coincidence. Our server was nice, but not very helpful. We got the usual that everyone else on Yelp orders: tuna nachos, shrimp tamale and pork tenderloin. The food was all delicious, but not \"spectacular\" and I wanted it to knock my socks off. Maybe since we had Ramsay's the night before, my expectations were too high? Hubby had a margarita, that was probably the most exciting part of the meal. I would like to come back and try lunch or brunch, as I saw some interesting items on the menu, plus not too many celebrity chef's restaurants do lunch."

Something for everyone. The best of the bunch was the jalapeno cheese bread. LOVED it. Cornbread really was very crumbly, and it was also slightly salty, which was odd. I like my cornbread sweet, thanks.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - Eh. Thought the sauce was a little weird....\n\nTiger Prawn Tamale - Oh man was that delicious. And the corn was so yummy, but it's really filling so be careful with that one as an appetizer.\n\nSophie's salad - Great! I love fruity dressings and cheese.\n\nCrab pancakes - You certainly do get a lot of crab, but I wasn't wowed by it. Very filling.\n\nPork tenderloin - I don't know if it was supposed to be cold, but I don't like my meat cold unless it is sandwich \"meat\". Had an interesting flavor, but eh.\n\nCuban burger - SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. I don't even like mustard (I told the waiter no dijon, and he said that was the one thing they couldn't take out...) but man was that burger good. I didn't even really taste the dijon.\n\nSpicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Okay, so I don't know if it's just me, but when I see \"hash\" I think like hash browns or maybe some sort of sweet potato fries... What we got was more like \"mash,\" and it was actually mixed in with the chicken.  Kind of gross in my opinion.  Really sweet, not spicy at all.\n\nCoconut layer cake - TO DIE FOR. So moist and delicious. And you get a gigantic slice. Enough for two or more people depending on how full you are.\n\nChocolate creme brulee with blueberry compote - OMNOMNOMNOM.  The chocolate at the bottom of the creme brulee really makes it even better."

When I attempted to order the speciality cocktail during the wait, I was informed that they were out.  When we were seated, we attempted to order a bottle of wine, which again was sold out.  \n\nThe food here was okay, but nothing special.  The quesadilla appetizer was no more impressive than what I've cooked in my toaster oven at home.  My steak was rather bland and a bit overcooked - not necessarily bland, but it definitely did not meet my expectations.  The service felt rushed, but was otherwise alright.  The atmosphere doesn't exactly portray an ambiance of fine dining, and I was rather disappointed.  This is a restaurant that suffers from too much light, which I've found is rare - I felt like I was dining in a chili's as opposed to a high-end, celebrity chef owned establishment. \n\nI would like to give MESA another chance, but I don't have a lot of motivation to go back based off my first experience.  Unless you are really a fan of Bobby Flay - I would search for an alternative.  There are worse places to eat in Vegas, but there are a lot that are far better."

I very much enjoyed the pork tenderloin sandwich.   It reminded me of watching Bobby on his Throw-down challenges.  The sandwhich could have been very Americana, or Asian fusion, or whatever.  At Mesa Grill, it was fresh, tender, and southwestern.  I'd order it again if we return.\n\nThe bread basket was great.  My favorite was the jalapeno corn muffin, which apparently also had blue corn on the bottom half.  Very moist and flavorful.  My son didn't like the raisin walnut bread so I got to try that too....great, especially with butter.\n\nDessert: disappointed to learn the churros with assorted dipping sauces  were not available at lunch. Had the sticky toffee pudding (like eating bread pudding) with salted cajeta and vanilla bean ice cream.  It was delicious.  Husband said the salted cajeta adds too much salt for his taste.  I liked it, but I also like sea salt cupcakes and salted coffee more than he does.\n\nKids had \"kids' cheeseburger\"   They were both impressed with it's size and double cheese.  They both took at least half back to our resort to finish at dinnertime.  They've never had $12 kids' burgers before.   \n\nI also had the specialty margarita.

While visiting vegas my friend and I decided that if there was one Iron chef restaurant we would make it to might as well make it a Bobby Flay restaurant and go for what he is known for.. some good grilled meat (steak and burgers in our case) with some heat. The burger was okay, nothing to write home about and there really wasnt much of a kick in the salsa they provided alongside of it. And Im a whuss when it comes to heat.. so I should have been able to feel it. My friend ordered the steak which was also good.. but not great. Being from Chicago and having been lucky enough to try some great food from well known chefs, I guess I almost always expect to be amazed by the food coming out of these kitchens..but that didnt quite happen. Plus the wait staff just seemed so disinterested in what they were doing. Not sure if it was just because they're stuck inside a casino all day..or they really didnt want to be there anymore.. but a smile could have changed this experience a whole lot more."

The bread basket they give you at the beginning of the meal is probably the best part of the entire meal; it's full of a variety of cornbreads and muffins. Though I could have been full just with the bread.\n\nWe had the lamb salad and the Belgian waffle. The lamb salad was nothing short of flavorful, but I would shy away from calling it a salad, as the dressing-to-lettuce ratio is laughably heavy. The waffle was delicious! Fresh fruit made for a satisfying and indulgent brunch treat.\n\nThe service was a bit sub-par, considering that it was a Saturday afternoon. We were left alone for far too long without the check. I wouldn't bend over backwards to go back."

I think people are way too drawn in by the fact that it's Bobby Flay's restaurant and not focused enough on the actual taste of the food. \n\nAmbiance:\nThis is nice, large restaurant with a small bar area. I guess because of its \"reputation\" they won't let anyone sit in the restaurant who's wearing a baseball cap or a tank top. I had to borrow my friend's sweater while my friend was told to take off his cap.\n\nFood:\n1) Complimentary bread basket that I've heard so much about was unique but there was only one type of bread that was actually good. One was nasty and another piece was covered in a thick layer of  powdered sugar. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa-grill-las-vegas?select=mBH2IApgViN1Np3ialqhQg#rni-4X8CehE-8vQMWsTXvQ\n2) Burger - The patty was OVERLY SALTY. I couldn't take more than one bite.\n3) Ancho Chile - honey glazed salmon was the only item that I tried that didn't taste like they poured salt by the handfuls into the dish. There wasn't much flavor on the salmon itself. There wasn't enough black bean and jalapeno crema sauce to give it enough flavor. It was decent, but I much prefer the salmon across the street at Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian/Palazzo.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa-grill-las-vegas?select=mBH2IApgViN1Np3ialqhQg#WQswlQMg3DSRSwFYVSocoQ\n4) Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash were topped with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise sauce. The sweet potato hash wasn't fully cooked all the way, so it wasn't all the soft. It's definitely not worth $18. I only liked the poached eggs and their unique green chile hollandaise sauce.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa-grill-las-vegas?select=mBH2IApgViN1Np3ialqhQg#7rdJhKnUpRvNvbcU15fE3g\nService:\nI only saw our server once. Everyone else did her entire job for her. The place was so empty and our server just took the order and disappeared. Someone else brought out our food, refilled our waters, busses our tables. I would've much rather tipped the other workers because they actually asked if we needed anything and saw how we were doing."

One thing to note is that on the weekends, they only serve brunch and not a typical lunch menu. That being said, the brunch menu still has a good variety of breakfast and lunch options.\n\nFor brunch, I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. It was the perfect amount of spicy with the rich hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs and hash combo. It was a nice twist on the typical corned beef hash, with chicken as the meat and a switch to sweet potatoes. I would definitely recommend for a hearty breakfast that is much different from traditional options. \n\nAnother favorite was the plate of mini breads, muffins, and scones that came complimentary before the meal. There was a chocolate scone, something that resembled a jalapeno cornbread, cheesy roll, all were delicious!"

But once I walked in and saw Flay's books for sale, I suddenly wondered...\"Is this Bobby Flay's restaurant...?\" After that I was excited to try the food and I have to say that I was NOT disappointed.\n\nFood: The food was so delicious! We started off with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which was superb. The chicken, grilled onions, cilantro, and sauce had great taste and texture. For our entrees, Eddie had the Pork Tenderlion served medium, which he LOVED and I had the 15 (or was it 18) Spice Chicken, which was very good! Eddie also loved his tamale and we both loved the Cilantro Mashed Potatoes, which we ordered as a side. A+++ for the food!\n\nService: We were a walk in, so unless we wanted to wait an hour for a table, we could sit at the bar, which we did. And it was fine! Our waitress was attentive. She was also very knowledgable about the menu, which was great!\n\nPrice: A pricier restaurant, but if you are going to dine at Caesar's it's actually a cheaper place to go unless you want to go to the overpriced steakhouse next store or to the crummy buffet. Also, the price was well worth the quality and taste of the food.\n\nOverall: We are definitely going back to the restaurant again the next time we are in Vegas. And when we go back to NY, we are planning on eating at his place over there as well!"

The restaurant is very colorful, in my opinion a little bit cheesy, but appropriate for Southwestern restaurant. The food was great! We had:\n\nSophie's Chopped Salad - amazing! very simple but bursting with flavor and crunch. I ordered it on both visits. \nTiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale- Excellent! Came with jumbo size prawns and a heavenly corn sauce. Each bite was heaven!\nSpicy Tuna and Salmon Tartares - This was good, but it was exactly what you would expect of a tartar. It wasn't bad by any means, but many of the other dishes overshined this standard plate.\nGrilled Lamb Poerterhouse- Tasty and huge but I like my lamb a little more muted in flavor. My hubby loved it though.\nBlue Corn Crusted Halibut - this was my entree. It was delicious!!! The corn crust added a new texture to the juicy tender halibut. The tomoatoe oragano gave a great kick with it's spiciness. Halibut needs big flavors and this dish definatley reflected that. \nNew Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin- Really flavor full and not dry at all.\nChorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale - I wanted this to be good, but it was very bland skip. This worked better in theory. \n\nAll in all we had a wonderful time at Bobby Flay's restaurant. The service was excellent, the flavors did not disappoint. While this was a spendy restaurant there are much more expensive restaurants on the strip. I would go back."

It was decent but not exceptional. The waiter said it was the spiciest thing on the menu, but it didn't seem spicy to me at all.  I'm wondering if the poached eggs is what made me ill.  \n\nMy cousin had the burger, and she liked it.  My husband had...well, I forget.  \n\nAnyway, I was very disappointed by my experience here.

Both were prepared well, though, we thought the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes (most items are served a la carte).  HOWEVER, if you're eating at a restaurant on the strip, it's to be expected, so I'm not complaining too much. And, the absolute highlight of the meal was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate cajeta cake. Don't let the rather simple description on the menu fool you. This cake is absolutely amazing! It's served warm and covered in a rich caramel sauce with a crispy chocolate topping. If you like chocolate, you can't miss out on this dessert!"

Any of the good choices were by the bottle and extremely for overpriced for the labels they offered. If you are the only wine drinker in the group it sucks.  It seemed a shame not to have a really good glass of wine to compliment the dishes. \n\nLastly if you still want to go after reading this then be sure to make your reservation about a week before you get there or expect to eat really, really late."

I was in Vegas this past weekend with 5 of my girlfriends for a girls weekend away.  I convinced them we had to go here for dinner because it was so amazing.  We ended up leaving quite disappointed and it still makes me bummed out to think about our experience.   First off, our appetizers took a long time to come out, but we just figured oh well, and we enjoyed them immensely.   Next came out our main courses.   3 of the 6 dishes that came out (2 filets and 1 salmon) were barely warm.  We kindly told our server about this, and she took them back and brought out new hot plates.  We are paying plenty of money to have our food come out hot.   The manager came over in the midst of this and gave a good fake \"I'm so sorry, yada yada yada\"   He came off like he was just going thru the motions and could care less about our issues.  Again, just blew it off and went about eating our newly delicious hot meals.   About 3/4 the way thru I noticed what looked to be a dark black hair about an inch/inch and 1/2 long in the middle of my sauce and mushrooms that went over my filet.  This instantly made my stomach turn and I was done.   All SIX of us were done at that point.   We had our server come back over and she took the plate without saying much.   She came back about 10 minutes later giving us the bill and saying the manager took off 2 of the plates and that they went back and investigated the hair and they thought it was a bristle from a brush they used in the kitchen.  Almost trying to justify the problem.  About 15 minutes had passed since finding this hair, and the manager FINALLY walks over again and says sorry and have a good night.   2 of the girls with us had been servers for many years and they said he was so incredibly unprofessional and we were all blown away at how this manager handled our situation.   We definitely fell on the younger side of the crowd, so my feeling was that he just kind of disregarded us since we were just younger and maybe he thought we were just looking for trouble.  Not really sure.  We were all dressed up and looked classy for a nice dinner out.   We all grew up going to nice restaurants, so we know what to expect.   Overall, the food is amazing here, but how this manager handled our situation made our experience extremely distasteful."

I miss them already. \n\nPaul's burger was also on point. it's a HUGE patty, and inexplicably is not greasy yet still super tasty. the bun didn't get soggy at any point, not even a hint of soggy, but the flavor and texture was all there. definitely a place to check out when you're in sin city!"

We both had glasses of red wine (my friend enjoyed her Mesa label wine).  We had the \"Queso Fundido\" and chips appetizer, which was good, but not outstanding.  We also shared the Blue Corn Pancake appetizer which was delicious.  My friend enjoyed her black bean soup for dinner and I ordered 2 side dishes:  The cornmeal crusted chile relleno and the chorizo-goat cheese tamale.  The chile relleno didn't leave me wanting for more and the tamale was rubbery and I didn't finish it.  \nOther than that, the restaurant had a hip ambience, but wasn't too noisy that you were hoarse from talking loud or couldn't hear what your tablemate was saying.  Again, I may have been more impressed if I ordered a \"real\" dinner, but hey, shouldn't I be impressed even with appetizers and side dishes if it is a good restaurant?  \nI probably would not come back to this restaurant.  So many good choices in Las Vegas!"

            "review": "$200/person? I'm not sure what the previous reviewer ordered, but for 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 1 dessert our total came out to just over $200. I always thought Bobby Flay was kind of douchey and I never really had any interest in going to one of his restaurants, but Throwdown came on when I was really hungry and I was hooked and made a reservation for my bf's bday dinner at Mesa Grill.\n\nI must say, I was pretty impressed. Everything we ate was delicious and the service was top notch. We started out with the tiger shrimp with tamale, the blue corn pancake with duck and the wild mushroom grits. I don't know what kind of sauce they put on the shrimp but it was soooo good. As were the wild mushroom grits with a perfectly poached egg. If they threw some bacon on that I could eat it for breakfast every day! The only slight disappointment was the blue corn pancake. I was expecting something more along the lines of a large blini and instead it was like a soft taco. \n\nFor our entrees my dad had the chicken, which I don't know if it was fried, but it had a very different crust on the outside. The bf ordered the fish, I think it was halibut and he didn't really like the accompanying sauce which he said was like bbq sauce. They also thought the portions were a bit small and their dishes didn't come with any sides. My mom had the veal with a wild rice tamale and I had the pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale, both of which were very generous portions and very tasty. Ok, now here comes my one gripe...yes, corn is southwestern, but if you notice, I swear everything here comes with a cornmeal-something. We started out with cornbread, then there were tamales with the shrimp, blue corn pancakes, grits, more tamales with the entrees, and if you wanted, there was even cornbread pudding for dessert. I don't think we gravitated toward cornmeal everything, but there is just a ton of it on the menu. \n\nWe were stuffed by the time dessert rolled around and we split the banana hazlenut sundae. It had these tiney bruleed bananas on top and a fig sauce. Very nice.\n\nI would love to come back here again, but there are many more Vegas restaurants to be tried and tasted first!"

No reservation but not a problem since they open at 10:30.  I asked what \"cactus pear\" tasted like, and the waiter couldn't describe it. So I took a leap and got it anyway, it was delicious but the best part was that they gave me a mini-carafe of simple syrup to sweeten it with!!  Yeaaaaaah.  The little things.\n\nAnyway, I was really eying up the chilaquiles but the waiter recommended the steak and eggs instead. What a mistake. So yeah, while the steak was cooked properly, the TORTILLAS WERE STALE. Nearly inedible! And I LOVE tortillas! And the bell pepper 'salsas' that it came with were cold and smushed together. The guac was brown. Just BLEH.\n\n$60 brunch and I didn't even get good tortillas or a good 'salsa' which I always see Bobby Flay coming up with.  Ugh."

I know for sure both of us had the filet with the coffee rub, and I remember thinking it was good but I wish it wasn't coffee.  Don't get me wrong, it was good quality cow, and it was cooked well, I just personally thought the flavor combo was a little strange (but I'm not a coffee drinker either).  And unfortunately mom won't try anything even resembling seafood and I'm not into mexican/tex-mex/southwestern much, so that doesn't help.  Other than that, I like the overall layout of the restaurant, though it was MUCH smaller than I thought it would be.  It was a good thing we opted for an early dinner that night, because they had a line all the way out the slot machines by the time we left.  I liked how you could see the action of the kitchen, but we weren't close enough for me to get a detailed view.  And it was a pleasant place to dine with good service.  So I'd go back and give it another shot, maybe try some of the grilled seafood or yummy sounding appetizers"

Unfortunately (or fortunately) I've been eating a lot of food in Vegas, so I was decidedly un-hungry when I arrived for lunch. \n\nI figured a margarita would help open the palate. For the premium margaritas you choose the tequila and they add lime juice and triple sec. I chose Gran Centenario A\u00f1ejo, and the result was amazing. Lots of tangy lime juice, keeping it refreshing and not at all syrupy. \n\nI ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad, and it was amazing. The presentation was so beautiful I was compelled to try it, even though my stomach was threatening me with possible mutiny. \n\nOne bite and I was hooked. The chicken was cooked perfectly, very tender and the seasoning packed a punch without going overboard.

            "review": "I was a bit wary of eating in a celebrity chef's restaurant... the tourist trap aspect, etc. Not here... We were blown away from start to finish. Great ambiance, impeccable service, knowledgeable staff, perfectly cooked food, amazingly complex and delicious sauces... and quite possibly the best margarita I have ever tasted (and believe me I have tasted quite a few!!) -- their signature Cactus Prickly Pear Margarita... I'm drooling on my desk just typing about it.\n\nWe showed up on a Sunday night a few minutes early for our reservation and were seated immediately by the stunningly gorgeous hostess. Our server's name was Brian and he was very helpful and attentive without being obtrusive. The bread basket had three different and equally amazing temptations -- an asiago sourdough, a wheat bread with raisins and walnuts, and a marbled corn muffin made from yellow and blue corn meal, with bits of infused pepper, and a great little ramekin of delicious butter formed into a perfect little cylinder. The margaritas came out, delivered by another server, a drink runner I suppose. My buddy ordered a regular margarita and I tried their signature drink, the cactus prickly pear margarita. We were both stunned at how delicious the drinks were. I've had hundreds of margaritas all over the country, and I can't think of another that tasted as good... Margaritas are all about proper proportions of ingredients, and these were spot on. I can only surmise that fresh squeezed juices and masterful mixing knocked these out of the ballpark for us.\n\nOur starters came out -- I ordered the grilled asparagus salad with toasted pecans, maytag blue cheese, roasted wild mushrooms + red chile-mustard vinaigrette. Perhaps the weakest link of the food we ordered, but still very good. My buddy had the crispy squash blossoms with ricotta, corn, sweet and hot yellow pepper sauce. This was the bomb and I was kinda jealous though I did manage to steal a few bites. Portion sizes were good, fairly generous, and the presentations were nice. Go squeeze bottle!\n\nNext came the entrees. I got the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. This plate really knocked my socks off... so tasty, so delicate, so beautifully and creatively presented. And quite a generous portion of perfectly cooked tenderloin. The sauces were complex -- a perfect balance of sweet, salty and spicy. I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, but the tamale, topped with the savory, nutty butter was so delicious. My buddy had the 22oz bone-in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce. He ordered it medium rare and charred, and it arrived at the table exactly as ordered. It's huge! It reminded us of the steak that tipped over Fred Flinstone's car. I tried a couple of bites and it was amazing. I'm not one who usually eats the gooshy fatty parts, but the charring give it a very pleasant melt-in-my-mouth texture that made me rethink that tendency. For us, both entrees were home runs, knocked out of the ballpark. We also split a chile relleno, which I believe was filled with white cheddar. It was great.\n\nWe were absolutely stuffed and though curious about their desserts, decided to pass. This was a memorable and exciting culinary experience for us both, and I absolutely have new respect for Chef Flay. To the servers and cooks who made this meal so perfect and memorable, I salute you! I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas, for sure. Keep up the good work!"

Bobby Flay now enjoys the esteem that comes with being one of the few actual chefs on the channel. \n\nDue to an array of constraints - Bradley Ogden and Restaurant Guy Savoy are closed on Tuesdays and my mother's show was at Caesar's Palace - we were prodded into Mesa Grill's direction. Going in to dinner, I could not help but hope that Ben Bernanke et al. would backstop our bill - as he did for Jamie Dimon when JP Morgan stepped in to rescue Bear Stearns - if the meal turned out to be \"toxic.\" \n\nWhen walking into Mesa Grill, one is bombarded by the variegated interior - blues, greens, oranges, and reds. It seems like something straight out of a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas acid trip. And yet, it makes sense, for once the food arrives, those same colors recrudesce in the form of blue corn meal, pea risotto, Ancho chili sauce, and assorted seafood. \n\nWhile my dining companion decided to go with the prix fixe menu, I hopscotched over the appetizers, ordering two entr\u00e9es instead: the cioppino and rabbit. \n\nAt the risk of sounding querimonious, let me start with the cioppino's deficiencies. First, it was oily. Second, I have heretofore never understood what people mean when they said that lobster can be chewy if poorly cooked. Just to cut through the tail meat required quite a bit of effort; not even Fletcherizing would have helped. Third, while the lobster claw provides a dramatic presentation, removing the meat meant that I would have to drench my fingers in the aforementioned oily liquid. Chief among the dish's auspicious elements was the sinus-clearing broth. Coriander balanced the sweet scallop and mussels. Both the blue corn stick and the walnut and raisin-studded bread also served as a palate emollient.\n\nAs for the rabbit, pardon the untenable Rachael Ray reference, but yum-o. The meat on the rack was, as always, difficult to access. Floating in the jus, the loin and leg were so tender. After finishing the rabbit, I still faced a sizable portion of risotto. Seeing a pile of peas was a thrill, given the paucity of vegetables in the meal, and to my surprise, they were not overcooked. My only gripe was the bean sprouts' length, which made for inelegant eating.\n\nMy companion went with the pork tenderloin. This was a well-seasoned and balanced combination. The dry rub on the pork coupled with the ancho chili packed a peppery punch, leaving me no choice but to lunge my fork into the sweet potato tamale."

            "review": "I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.  Based on my experiences, I have decided that the best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much the restaurant relies on the celeb's name rather than the food to get people in the door.\n\nMy friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind the hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in the restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past the open kitchen where the chef manning the grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  The table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped the other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having the conversation I wanted to have with my friend there.\n\nOur waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us the day's specials.  \"Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on the food network?\" he simpered as he held the menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  The Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were the ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12.\n\nMy biggest complaint about Mesa, and the reason I only give it one star, is the seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around the lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as I was.\n\nWe quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon the floor manager came to apologize, but she did it in the rudest way I can imagine.  \"Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?\" she demanded.  \"Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet...\" I replied.  Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  The right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that.\n\nFunny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, I said \"It's ok,\" which is about how I felt.  She shot me the angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy.\n\nMy salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was \"ok.\"  Maybe the dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out."

The shrimp tamale was to-die-for and the mojitos were fantastic! Well, I just went with a couple of friends to LV a couple of days ago, and I nonchalantly suggested we eat at Mesa Grill before hitting the clubs. Dinner was fabulous. (The ritas were tasty too!) Most of us had huge filets (like double the usual portion size) that just melted in our mouths. I wasn't impressed with the cornbread (little dry) or my side, a blue corn tamale that was just blue cornmeal, nothing in it, but other than that, it's a great place for a great meal.\n\nDinner is entree only, sides are separate so it's pricey, but what worth doing/eating doesn't cost a pretty penny in Vegas? \n1 drink + filet + 1 side = $85 (inc tax + tip)"

The food is delish, although the prices are a bit steep!  \n\nFor starters, we've tried the bacon & hash brown enchilada and their tiger shrimp and roasted corn tamale.  I'm not a big fan of enchiladas, but this one is pretty good to eat...comes with an egg on top as well.  The tamales are bomb, but man, they need like 2-3 more shrimps on there!  \n\nI love their Pork Tenderloin sandwich.  The pork is served cold and comes on a ciabatta like bun with arugula and some ancho chile mayo sauce.  On the side, you have these great southwestern french fries that compliments the sandwich just perfect. As much as I love this place, sometimes when I get the sandwich, the fries are hit and miss.  The last time I was there, there were almost rock hard.  \n\nMy hubby gets the Mesa Burger from time to time and says it's really good.  It's a big burger and be ready to get dirty cause it looks a lil messy to eat!  \n\nFor dinner, we've also had the steak, chicken and duck plate, I believe it was.  Again, all that we've tried have been really good!  \n\nOh, how I crave the pork tenderloin sandwich now! :)"

We ordered appetizers and cocktails which was all delicious. We ordered the Queso Fundido, good but nothing to write home about, the Tiger Prawn Tamales, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!, and the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos. I love anything with tuna so I was blown away by these!\nFor drinks we each ordered different margaritas, which were all delicious and well mixed. \nI think that over-all the prices are pretty steep but we are talking about Vegas here. A lot of things in that town are over-priced but it's more about the experience that you're getting. Our waitress was lovely and patient even though she probably knew that we were not big spenders considering we all look under 21... she even recommended some stuff for us to check out while we were in town and answered our questions about Bobby Flay. I loved every moment of being there because it totally jived with the personality Bobby Flay projects in all of his shows. He seems like a cool and relaxed guy and that still comes through in his over-hyped restaurant. All of the wait staff is friendly and welcoming and it never felt stuffy or pretentious. But next time I'll go back with my parent's so I can experience more of that yummy menu!"

I've seen all the shows I've studied the way he cooks and I was amazed by the food at his restaurant. It was even better than I expected. The grill marks on my steak were beautiful and it was cooked PERFECTLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH! The queso fundido was full of flavor and just so good words couldn't explain. Back to the steak... It had a delicious sauce on the plate and everything was served beautifully .. The bread was so good and different ! We also had Bobby's mash potatoes and I was in heaven. I loved this place and can't wait to go to Vegas to have it again. I had no complaints everything was amazing! It was a dream come true. It was like everything was cooked the way Bobby would want it!  And if you know Bobby Flay.. You would know what I mean! One thing I will say is that we came casually dressed and it seemed as if the waiter didn't treat us as well as he treated the people who came in suits and all. It was hard to leave a good tip thinking this guy didn't attend to us as well as those who looked as if they had tons of money but it felt good leaving something he wouldn't have ever expected from people who \"looked\" middle class so to say.. Hopefully it showed him not to judge a book by its cover. Other than that Bobby your restaurant exceeded expectations! We will be back next year!"

So when we stayed and Caesar's Palace on our last Vegas trip, we made a point of planning a meal here. We went for brunch on a Sunday morning. I was so excited, the menu sounded delicious. I tend to ask for recommendations a lot when I go somewhere new because who better than the server to tell me what's delicious? After ordering the recommended appetizer, drinks and a round of waters, we waited hungry, thirsty and eager to feed a mild hangover. We waited and waited and waited. It was 10 mins for a water. 20 mins for our bar drinks. 25 for our appetizer. 40 mins for our entrees. None of the food was particularly memorable so the deepest impression I'm left with is the horrible service. There were only four parties in the entire restaurant! After waiting for our check, it took the server another 20 mins to pick up our credit cards. I couldn't believe it when (after 10 mins of waiting for the credit card slips to be returned) I went to the bathroom and then went looking for my party at the entrance back to the casino, only to look up and see he still hadn't brought back the credit card slips for signature! It was absolutely some of the worst service I've ever had, with mediocre food at a HIGH cost. I will never eat her again. Nor any of Bobby Flay's other restaurants. I only give it two stars because the food wasn't bad."

Both were excellent. I eat my steak rare and they delivered - Thank you. The meyer lemon cheese cake was truly great as well. No complaints at all."

The stock with the cilantro and peppers blended in left something to be desired.  The seafood was good so it wasn't a total failure but the broth...eh. \n\nThe tamale with the tiger shrimp was good.  A big improvement over the dry starchy everyday tamale.   The Yucatan Chicken Tacos reminded me of Peking duck with the hoisen like BBQ sauce and the vietnamese style herbs (more cilantro and mint).  Messy but good.\n\nPan Seared Squid = Fail.  It wasn't memorable except for the fact that I remember not enjoying it when I was eating it.  \n\nOh and the cocktails are lovely.  I think that is why I can only remember four dishes, though I believe I had more. \n\nJust to vent - this is a popular restaurant in Las Vegas so they should assume that some people do not have the foresight to make reservations and will inevitably opt to eat in the bar/lounge area.  Maybe they should make the lounge tables more conducive to eating...like make the tables more than 18 inches in diameter when each plate is more than 12 inches wide."

Did I mention I started working there a week ago?  No?  My bad...I get a discount on restaurants there so I asked my friends if they have ever heard of Mesa Grill?  Nope...   Do they watch the food network ?\" and you can see the  lights starting to come on...\"Yes!\"  They know Bobby Flay...it's tough to get to the sensitive side of bomb disposal guys but I managed...\n\nI called around 5:30 PM on Sunday, last night, and asked for reservations within 30 minutes.  The very nice lady who answered the phone had a place for us in 45 minutes.  Sweet!  Gave us some time to check out the new pool, show them where the Seven Stars Diamond Lounge is located, check out the pics of Joe Namath standing on the sidelines with Bear Bryant, and Mohammad Ali knocking out Sonny Liston.... We arrived to a team of four standing in the elegantly adorned entry.  The place is SEXY.  Note to self, bring date here!  Big smiles from the Hostess.  Felt very welcome and warm fuzzies all over.  :~)  We were about 20 minutes early and wanted to get a drink, but they sat us immediately.  The place was packed with smartly dressed people, all having their taste buds do the Snoopy Dance as they dined on incredible looking foods.  Just beautiful presentations all around.  \n\nWe're seated at a table for 4; two chairs and a booth like seating with nice cushions and a wonderful view of the entire restaurant from back to front.  I let my visiting friends have the luxurious view since I wanted this to be a special and memorable event for them.  It's like stadium seating where there is the ground floor seating...\n\n(had written a much more entertaining review two weeks ago when I went  but my #$^%%$$ ^%$#!@ wireless kicked me OUT!!!  I'm okay now but do apologize if this segment of the review lacks luster)\n\nI've since forgotten the names of our incredible Wait Person, and her entourage, but we got kiss butt service, everything was explained, they were professional without being stuffy, helpful, knowledgeable and supportive of our choices, without saying, \"that's my favorite\"... I can't be that lucky or I had better go buy a lotto ticket.  I digress...not about me...\n\nTake a peek at the pic and those pics SHOUT a thousand words about how amazing this place is.\n\nGet ready to have your taste buds do the happy dance.\n\nChow!"

Started off with the Tiger shrimp +roasted garlic corn tamale which was the bomb to the lobster with the hominy cakes topped with Fresno chile butter sauce which was worth every damn penny! The desserts we ordered was the chocolate sticky toffee pudding cake and the pistachio brown butter cake. If you've ever wanted a foodgasmn, I suggest you try that chocolate sticky pudding cake and the tiger shrimp tamale. We all ate off each others plate so everything from Mesa grill was on point! The filet Mignon, the crusted pork tenderloins, the pesto mash potatoes,the cornmeal crusted chile relleno and the drinks....all delicious! The waiters were knowledgeable and funny and the service was great! We had Paul as our waiter. He was the best! He made everything sound so delicious when we asked him what was in each dish that we ended up ordering whatever he was describing,and it did not disappoint.

I loved everything.   \n\n I made reservations  for our party of 4 and sadly enough we were late from all the traffic and parking fiasco.   But along the way, we called and informed them and the host accepted it as calm as can be.   So getting there about 30 minutes late for our 8:30 dinner reservation, we had to wait about 5 minutes till our party was complete.   Right then and there they led us to our table and offered for drinks on the spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and the margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got the kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about the wine list. He even pointed out some of the specific details of the tequila list and explained some of the items on the menu. The bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with the customer service and the interior.   We skipped the appetizer and decided to go for the entree since we had to catch up with our schedule for the club.   I opted for the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and the meat in the center.   The flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish the plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try the seafood. \n\nI'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering the strip traffic and the parking.   There are three places to valet park and the best one is all the way in the back closest to the restaurant."

I had very high expectations going into this meal (based on Yelp reviews) and they were all met! Me and Ms. Mega went to Vegas in August for our Anniversary and MESA was our anniversary dinner. \n\nReservations were for 7:30pm for Monday and the place was full, always a good sign I guess! We were sat at a table close to the open part of the kitchen so I was able to see all the different dishes coming out. They bought us a basket of bread, and they were quite good, I enjoyed the jalapeno muffin the best. I ordered a Pear Margarita and it was strong! It tasted good but just a bit too strong for me, at least you can't say they're stingy with the tequila! \n\nI had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and Ms. Mega had the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. I have to say this is the BEST Pork Tenderloin I have E V E R had! The first bite was just amazing, the spices were just right, it wasn't too hot but at the same time you knew it was there. The pork was so tender and moist, it was cooked perfectly. The flavors combined for a PARTY in my mouth, usually I inhale my food but this meal I really took my time to enjoy the spices. Even my GF enjoyed the pork and she is not the biggest fan of the pork. My GF enjoyed her duck, I had a piece and thought it was ok but I think I was a bit biased because of how good my pork tenderloin was. By the time I was down to my last piece of pork, I was cutting my bites smaller and smaller, trying to savor the last of this heavenly pork. \n\nWe were full but I really wanted to try the Toasted Coconut Layered Cake, and it was good! The slice we got was pretty big, and was very very rich and delicious. We tried to finish it but we tapped out with 3-4 bites left. \n\nThe service was very good, our waiter was very good, not overbearing and our water glasses were continually filled. \n\nOverall this was an awesome tasty experience, the total bill was about $130 with tip and I felt it was worth every penny. I will definitely eat here again when I come back to Vegas next year!"

Koch, Buchautor, Restaurantbetreiber  sein Name steht f\u00fcr das Mesa Grill-Konzept und ist im ganzen Land wohl bekannt. Nach dem Hauptrestaurant Mesa Grill in New York residiert seit 2004 diese Dependance in Las Vegas, als eines der vielen Restaurants im Caesars Palace (http://www.mesagrill.com/las-vegas-restaurant) .\nGleich neben dem vibrierendem Leben des Casinos strahlt das Mesa Grill in einer gro\u00dfartigen Dekoration und gew\u00e4hrt dem Gast trotz der Casinon\u00e4he angenehme Ruhe f\u00fcr ein hochwertiges Essen. Inspiriert wird die K\u00fcche haupts\u00e4chlich durch den S\u00fcdwesten der Staaten. So gibt es viele mexikanisch gepr\u00e4gte Gerichte wie z.B. New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin mit Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce, Sweet Potato Tamale und Crushed Pecan Butter. Aber die Angebote gehen weiter und es f\u00e4llt schwer, eine Entscheidung zu treffen.\nAuf die Preise sollte man weniger achten, hier ist nichts g\u00fcnstig. Aber  und das muss fairer Weise gesagt werden, es wird geliefert und das vom Feinsten.\nWir w\u00e4hlten Cascabel Rabbit ($ 38), Pork Tenderloin ($ 36) und eine Extraportion Tamale ($ 9). Die Preise verstehen sich immer + Tax und + Tip.\nDer Hammer aber war der Wein! Unschl\u00fcssig, was wir w\u00e4hlen sollten (ein Roter sollte es sein), lie\u00dfen wir uns beraten. Drei Angebote blieben dann letztendlich im Raum stehen und wir w\u00e4hlten den Zenith 2010 aus Oregon. Wir bezeichnen uns durchaus als Rotwein-Kenner, hatten aber noch nie geh\u00f6rt, dass es Weine aus Oregon gibt. Das Servieren wurde zelebriert und schon der erste Degustations-Schluck lie\u00df die Augen rollen. K\u00f6stlich! Und noch spannender wurde es, als wir in Ruhe das r\u00fcckw\u00e4rtige Etikett auf der Flasche lasen: Es wurde exakt der Tag genannt, an dem die Trauben f\u00fcr diesen Wein geerntet (gepfl\u00fcckt) wurden, dann auch der Tag, wann sie in Eichholzf\u00e4sser kamen und schlussendlich der Kalendertag, als die Abf\u00fcllung in Flaschen stattfand. Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich tr\u00e4gt jede Flasche eine Nummer und ist somit individualisiert. Diese Flasche war nicht mehr nur ein Glasbeh\u00e4lter f\u00fcr Wein, sondern mutierte f\u00fcr uns zum liebevollen Leben.\nWas haben wir eigentlich an diesen Tagen gemacht, so stellten wir uns die Frage. Leider hatten wir keine Kalender mit, um sie zu beantworten.\nDer Preis: Erschwingliche $ 80 ++. Und damit nur im mittleren Preissegment der Weinkarte. Wir konnten uns nicht vorstellen, welchen Mehrgenuss die angebotenen Weine f\u00fcr mehrere hundert Dollar/Flasche bringen sollten. \nFazit: Der Abend hat uns rund $ 200 f\u00fcr zwei Personen gekostet. Wir haben es uns geg\u00f6nnt und waren sehr zufrieden. Wir verstehen jetzt, warum das Mesa Grill einen so exzellenten Ruf hat, in New York eh, aber seit vielen Jahren auch in Las Vegas. Ein Top-Platz f\u00fcr einen besonderen Abend. F\u00fcnf Sterne."

The food was really good, though I wouldn't say it gave me an apr\u00e8s dinner foodgasm. \n\nWe started with the tiger shrimp app with a roasted garlic corn tamale. It was flavorful and well spiced. I dare say it was the most interesting part of my meal. As a main we shared the lamb, which was quite good, with goat cheese tamales that disappointed all around. I mean, points for the intention (tamales AND goat cheese! I expected to be in heaven! What happened?). The mashed potatoes and queso were sinful. The toffee bread pudding was delicious, but I couldn't help but compare it to another restaurant's to-die-for toffee pudding, and it didn't quite reach that level.\n\nSince I'm a fan of keeping it real, my first impression of Mesa Grill is that it would really shine if it were one price point lower and stayed in the mid $20s to low $30s range. Of course, you're paying for the casino experience and the fact that it's Bobby Flay's baby. Maybe I'll get another go at Mesa in the future and try some other dishes. I will say there were a lot of good-looking choices on the menu."

They also brought an awesome assortment of breads, muffins, cranberry cornbread, etc. I ate all of them.!\n\nThe only issue I had was that although the wait service was very good, when they were cleaning the table next to me the bus boy and my waiter were complaining about another employee. Certainly a isolated incident that you likely would not experience, but it was unprofessional to do it in front of a customer in my opinion. \n\nThe waiter was otherwise great, but I was not offered a dessert menu which I found odd.  Maybe they just don't have dessert on the brunch menu. \n\nIt also was less expensive than I anticipated since it's such a famous place.

I hear the cactus pear margarita is amazing. (The waiter offered me something to drink, but I'm not yet 21...meep). The best appetizer is easily the queso fundido, although the wild mushroom quesadillas and the pumpkin soup (I'm not sure if it's a seasonal addition or not) are amazing as well.\n\n I always get the chile relleno, because it's the only vegetarian main dish. However, it's soooo good that I don't care that I don't have any other option. It's filled with manchego cheese and eggplant, which is awesome because I absolutely love manchego cheese, but I kind of liked the dish better when it was filled with goat cheese and zucchini. Oh yeah, and I've heard great things about the steak.\n\nDesserts are good, as well, however not nearly as good as the main courses and appetizers. The last time I was here, I had the apple cider cake. The vanilla creme fraiche ice cream it came with was very good, but sadly, the cake was a little on the dry side. \n\nI also love that there's a cookbook with all the recipes for this restaurant.

The plate was saturated in this sauce which was incredibly over powering, too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better quality balsamic. I had this taste in my mouth for days. It was edible but I don't feel was executed properly and for the cost I would expect that. When i told the waiter he said it's not for everyone. I explained that the issue was the vinegar was over powering and if it was properly done it should be more sweet than vinegar. The lamb chops were a little over done cooked medium well-ish and were and effort to cut. The tamale served with it was underwhelming at best. \n\nMy friend had the ciopinno, and it was phenomenal.. I was very  very jealous of his dish and he was lovely to share with me. The flavor of the broth was sensational, I could drink the broth. The seafood was quality.\n\nWe had the hibiscus margaritas, which I loved! \n\nThe bread served at the beginning was interesting. Some I liked more than others. the jalapeno corn bread I felt just had a weird flavor, and the taste of baking soda was intense. My husband didn't seem to notice. \n\nThe ambiance definitely leaves something to be desires. I feel more as if i am in some high ceiling-ed cafeteria with table cloths. It's not romantic or special, more of a cattle call. I think the design could have lent a little more to the intimacy and experience of enjoying the food. Again, for the price I have had better for less. \n\nBased on my experience and for the cost this place, I would say I expected more.  The Ciopinno is what saved my experience. I might try this place again if I was with a group or person who insisted on going but would not get the lamb, and most likely wouldn't seek it out again."

The wait was about 45 minutes. That was pretty good considering it was a Saturday night at Caesar's Palace. They have comfy couches in the waiting area BTW.\n\nFinally it was our turn. We sat down in this pretty, modernly decorated restaurant. Our waitress was really nice and attentive to our needs. I was in a fish mood so I ordered the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. It honestly wasn't that good, but my cousins and brother got some awesome plates! The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin: Awesome! And Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: Delicious! Definitely try those. For dessert we shared the Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Cake. Really good.  (See my pictures!)\n\nI wouldn't mind coming here again :) Pricey but delicious."

It was about 630pm and we were a walk-in party of 4 and were seated at the last open table available. The party behind us were told they would have to come back at 9pm. Once seated, our waitress asked us if we had a show to get to or any other time commitments. We told her we had a show at 8pm. She told us that she'd try to get us out in time and that we could probably only order an entree. \n\nA lot of the items on the menu were tex mex or some rendition of a Mexican dish. A lot of them also had a spice rub or something on the side with a kick to it. We ordered the lamb chops, veal chops, the sixteen spice chicken and the tuna steak. I had the lamb chops and they came out just right. The tomatillo on the side was a great addition. The cuts of meat were just enough, not too much and not too little. Cooked perfect to my liking. Although I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, the balance of flavors and spice was tolerable. I wasn't overly impressed by our meal but I was also not disappointed. I recommend checking it out if you like this type of cuisine."

The Pork Tenderloin had a great smoke flavor and a tasty corn tamale. For a side dish I would highly recommend the cauliflower dish which was just amazing. \nOverall, this restaurant was great.

It was moderately spicy but extremely delicious.\n\nFire Roasted Veal Chop: This had excellent flavor and another highly recommended dish.  It was large, tender, and the char on it was perfect.  \n\nRoasted Corn Side Dish: Another delicious dish.

Though they only give you around 4 shrimps, you will still be happy because of the yummy sauce you can dip your complimentary bread into, and the masa, which I could seriously eat bowls of. My boyfriend ordered the blue corn pancake with bbq duck and he was very happy with it. I would definitely love to come back here again and try some more of Bobby Flay's yummy sounding dishes.

I had little expectations just because it's in a hotel and I didn't know how Tex Mex would be in a casual fine dining atmosphere.  \n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is great.  It's bright and welcoming.  This place is busy so definitely make reservations.  \n\nWe showed up early and we were told that they wouldn't be able to seat us until our reservations (completely fine), so we left and came back about 3 minutes before our reservation.  They were behind a little.  10 minutes pass and the host let us know that she didn't foret about us but tables were turning slow (loved that she acknowledged us) and then after another 5-10 minutes she came up to us and said that the restaurant would be buying us drinks for the wait (okay!) we sat about a half hour after our reservation and they immediately sent us out an appetizer to again apologize.  I was impressed with how they handled it.  I worked as a host for years and was happy to see that these hosts worked the front so well.\n\nAfter we sat down we were greated by our server and started ordering our food.  Everything came out perfectly from the corn bread to the filet mignon.  The rock shrimp tamale was oh so good!  I am not a Rib Eye fan but the flavor of the cut was so good!  I also had the duck pancake.  I would have eaten those all night.  I would stray from the double baked potato and get the corn if they have it on the menu as a side.  It was like eating candy (not sweet, just you don't want to stop eating it!) \n\nThe chef's in the kitchen are trained to perfection.  People it's NOT Bobby Flay cooking your steak and it's not him making your menu!  Give credit where credit is deserved!  A lot of people don't realize it's just his name and face sometimes but his executive chef's and sous chefs do a lot of the grunt work and creativity! The presentations were beautiful as well.\n\nAnd I can't forget the backwaits.  Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were whisked away silently and we were never bumped into when they were clearing other tables (even though the tables are very close together).\n\nThe prices of the food and drinks are expensive but what do you expect?  Other than the quality being top notch you are in Caesars eating at Bobby Flay.  If you don't like a perfectly cooked filet at $44 then go to Denny's.  I think they have a $2.99 special from midnight to 6am.\n\nThis was a great meal. I would tell anyone going to vegas to try this place because you will not be disappointed!  I love seeing other foodies enjoy this place as much as I did!"

Both drinks were well-loved and lightened the mood.\n\nThe service was very friendly & the food was excellent.  You must try the Tiger Shrimp (the tamale it comes with is divine).  The grits are possibly the best thing on the menu.  Despite how pedestrian grits may sound, their texture is perfect and they are mixed with some delicious cheese.  UMAMI!  Order them.\n\nOne bone to pick with the place:  they don't like to make substitutions because of the way they run their kitchen.  I was able to get the poached eggs w/ green chile hollandaise a la carte, but the waiter told us that it's a rarity for them to do so.\n\nI would absolutely come back, but it might be for brunch again since it's so much cheaper than the dinner menu."

Even the bread basket we started with was delicious, made up of a fresh cornmuffin, a sweet bread with raisins baked inside, and another bread with jalepeno pieces baked in giving it a tiny bite. Dined here with my hubby during our Vegas weddingmoon and we were very pleased. The lobster tacos are fresh and yummy as a starter, comes w/ 3 bite size tacos. The tiger shrimp appetizer is a must. The creamy corn sauce with fresh cilantro goes so well with the shrimp. For an entree I got the pork tenderloin, something I typically wouldn't order but it was highly recommended by a frequent diner. It was the perfect portion size for me. The meat was tender and delicious, complimented by flavors of black pepper and some slightly spicy orange sauce that was awesome. Also got a side of the queso mashed potatoes sprinkled with fresh herbs (maybe chives?)...very creamy and delicious. Only complaint is that I ordered a mixed drink that tasted as if it was made with cheap, bad alcohol. If I'm paying an arm and a leg to wine & dine in Sin City, it's pretty disappointing to be served a poor quality cocktail."

I ordered a Gimme A Lemonade, which was probably meant to be equal parts Green Tea Vodka and Lemonade, but was mostly vodka.  Nothing wrong with a strong drink, especially when shelling out 12 bucks for it, but I don't think it was worthy of being a featured cocktail. Should have gone with the Black Widow Mojito. \n\nWe were seated after 10 or 15 minutes.  There were 5 of us total, and we each ordered appetizers. The Sea Scallop Ceviche and the Blue Corn Pancake were standouts. The pancake was wrapped around tender BBQ duck  and drizzled with a Habanero-Chile Anise sauce. Amazing.  The Ceviche was so good I literally had to stop myself from slurrping it up like Campbell's Chicken Noodle. Sometimes sharing is no fun.  Also noteworthy was the Beet Salad. \n\nI ordered the New Mexican Spice Ruibbed Pork Tenderloin, with Bourbon Ancho Chile sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale. It was a huge portion, cooked to a perfect medium temp.  It was delicious, but I kept pilfering from my friend's Fire Roasted Veal Chop, so I could not finish.  I also tried the 16 Spice Duck, which was as good as the Blue Corn app.  \n\nMesa offers a fairly decent wine selection. The 2006 Ken Wright Abbot Claim Pinot Noir  recommended the wine steward worked with every entree.  Our service was very good, and the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I felt that the dessert menu left something to be desired.   After dinner we headed straight to Payard for dessert."

If I were ever to be on death row, I'd have Mesa Grill for my last meal. It's ALWAYS a great meal.\nThis is the 3rd time we've been to Mesa in Las Vegas, and it will not be our last. EVERY time we go to Vegas, we make sure we have dinner here, because it is always wonderful. We were there for New Years Eve, so it was a Prix Fix menu for $120 each with app., entree, and dessert.\nI love the cornbread biscuits, I actually bought the Mesa cookbook and love to make them at home any chance I get. The chef prepared three bites for us which included a surf and turf and a tartar. Wish it would've been more than a bite each!\nI ordered their classic Margarita, which is made so so well. They have a ton of different Margaritas on their menu, but I always get the classic as it is always good.\nOur appetizers were lobster tacos and another Mesa favorite, the duck pancake. The lobster tacos were a bit spicy, so I got to eat them all as the Boy doesn't do super spicy foods. The duck pancake was exquisite as always. \nFor entrees, the Boy ordered scallops, which I had more than one bite of. I don't like scallops, but these were good. I ordered the rabbit which came with a bone in leg and some additional meat. So so yummy. I don't like bone in food, but I made an exception.\nFor dessert we ordered the coconut cake to go (which didn't last into the morning). We ordered it last year so we knew it was good. It is very moist and the icing is not super sweet, but it is such a great compliment to the cake. We also ordered the banana pie for dining in which was splendid. Lots of bananas and great flavor. \nI cannot wait to go back and I am always looking for excuses to go back to Vegas."

The restaurant's facade is cool, it is elegant and refined, yet laid back and calls to mind the island feel of the Caribbean.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were invited graciously to sit at the bar.  We promptly obtained drinks from the bartender, and were ushered to our table without issue.  However, our server seemed displeased that we had ordered drinks from the bar thus lessening his sale for our table.  We ordered two of the Tiger shrimp tamales which arrived at an unsettlingly fast pace.  Any hesitation by the \"fast-food\" speed with which they appeared was soon dashed by the overwhelming deliciousness that sprang forth from the plates.  Having eaten at many superb restaurants I feel compelled to say that these are some of the best starters I have yet to experience.\n\nAfter the table was cleared I sat in anticipation for the main courses to arrive.  Our table had ordered two of the Coffee Rubbed Filets, one of the Black Angus Strips and one Chipotle Glazed Ribeye as well as an order of collard greens, mashed potatoes and, upon recommendation of the server, an order of Brussel sprouts.  My steak arrived and I noted how truly pleasing it was to the eye; however, I was disheartened that such an exquisite piece of meat seemed over powered by the bountiful amount of sauce on the plate.  Once I had cut into my steak and taken a bite I was instantaneously reminded that this was Chef Bobby Flay's house and his cooking was inextricably linked to him.  The protein on my plate was classic and refined and delicious, yet it had been arrogantly and flamboyantly altered to meet the needs of a Chef's personality.  The two sauces on the plate competed with the beef and reminded me of an episode of \"Throwdown\" except no one won, and my palate was an innocent bystander.\n\nI looked for solace in the sides on the table and it was then I noticed that the recommended sprouts were missing.  After some time, we got the server's attention and asked him to forget the sprouts since we probably wouldn't need them or have room for them at this point.  He blatantly disregarded this request and demanded that we try them, because to do so would somehow be a personal affront to him.  We yielded.  When the sprouts arrived they were undercooked and over-seasoned to the point of sheer carelessness.  We each sampled one for the humor of it but left them on the table as a comedic reminder of how far off this meal had gone.\n\nIn summaton, this restaurant has the location, the ambience and the kitchen to be elite.  Yet when given an opportunity to let the cuisine evolve into greatness, it seems the staff from the highest to lowest get in the way of their own success."

He liked it so much that he asked me to cancel my reservations for the next evening and to just make another reservation here.  So, we ate there two nights in a row.  We have no shame.\n\nThe first night, we had goat cheese queso fundido and the lamb porterhouse, with cactus pear margaritas, and shared two desserts - the coconut cake and the chocolate bread pudding.\n\nThe queso fundido was even better than I remembered it.  I *love* this appetizer.  I could not get every little bit of cheese off the iron dish and that made me sad.   \n\nThe lamb was probably the best lamb we've ever had (and I'm a connoisseur of lamb, it is one of my favorite dishes.  The marinade was perfect - just a hint of mint and a hint of vinegar, not overwhelming at all, and I kept trying to sop up every little bit from my plate.  You get two thick steaks with the order, quite red in the center but absolutely delicious.  It comes with a goat cheese / chorizo tamale which is pretty good (not as good as the shrimp tamale appetizer but still good).\n\nThe margaritas were good, but aside from being pink I didn't discern any particular flavor other than your normal lime margarita flavor.\n\nOf the desserts we liked the coconut cake a lot but weren't too keen on the bread pudding as it was very bitter.  The coconut cake was a very large portion, easily split between 2-3 people.\n\nOur server on the first night was excellent.\n\nThe second night we ordered the queso fundido again along with the duck pancake for appetizers.  I had the lamb again, my honey had the ribeye.  We skipped dessert and drinks.  The duck pancake we didn't find that exciting - it reminded my honey of barbeque pulled pork that we had recently but for much cheaper.  It tasted fine but you can do much better here.  The ribeye was good, honey was happy with it - though we both preferred the lamb.\n\nOur server the second night was fine but nothing standout.  I think he actually disappeared partway through the meal and got replaced by someone else.\n\nI am upping my rating to 5 stars even though there were a few duds on the menu because between the lamb, queso fundido, shrimp tamale and the coconut cake one can get an amazing 5 star meal."

Asked for another table, ended up waiting for another 30 minutes, followed by a snarky comment from one of the Hostesses \"Don't they know they are at the Mesa Grill\"?  Really?   Finally got another table just be ignored by a lazy waiter. Ordered a bowl of black bean soup, that may have been better had it been warm. SO WE LEFT.  Never again Bobby Flay.  Your restaurant and your employees are not worth the time or our hard earned dollar."

My hubby and I have eaten all up and down the strip and Mesa is consistently excellent.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we started with the duck blue corn pancake, which was super yummy. I also love the bread basket that they bring around - I could eat an entire loaf of the jalapeno sourdough. Yummmm.\n\nFor lunch I had the shrimp tacos and hubby the pork tenderloin sandwich.  Both were excellent and we were very pleased with our meals. \n\nI also had some fancy (must've been for $16!) margarita that the waiter said was some special drink and something about Oprah (I'll try anything that Oprah likes!!). While a bit expensive, it really was the best marg I've ever had.\n\nCan't wait to go back again!"

It was smokey, dark, and sweet. Love that the eggs were just lightly scrambled and airy. Also enjoyed the crispy fried tortilla on the bottom and dug that the layer of white cheddar lined the tortilla instead of traditionally being draped on the top. Was a huge portion however. I feel like they used 8 eggs just for the one dish!\n\nMidlights:\n- Bread: just ok. I didn't think the corn muffin had much flavor. I liked blueberry coffee cake square the best \n- Pork sandwich: expected more bold flavors from the pork itself but the crispy panini bread was very good\n\nLowlights:\n- Service: not very attentive--had to wait a while for our order to be taken \n\nLiked my brunch dish and would consider coming back."

The menu prices were to be expected, after all we were @ Ceasar's Palace. The service was impecable.\n\nThe bread was fabulous, but don't fill up on it. We ordered a shrimp tamale as an appetizer. It was so good, I needed to be home to eat it. The masa was so flavorful that you would want to eat the husk. The only problem was that you get just one @ a cost of about $16., let's not forget it was GREAT!! \n\nI ordered the lobster, it was better than I ever expected. I simply melted in my mouth. I was happy to see that it was a whole lobster & not the tail weighing in @ about 1.5lbs., cooked to perfection. The sides are ordered ala cart & they are large enough to share,. \n\nMy cousin's ordered The bone-in steak & the other the salmon. They stated it was very good & I'm sure it was but I know it couldn;t be as good as my lobster.\n\nFor dessert, I had the creme brule. Anytime I see it on the menu, I feel it my duty to order. It was also great. beverages were fantastic, top shelf all the way.\n\nIf you want a 5 Star meal @ a reasonable price. This is the place"

Boy was I wrong.\n\nWe started with the Shrimp with Blue Corn Tamale, Chicken tacos, and the quesadilla. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, the tamale-delicious. My fave appetizer is the Quesadilla. I love goat cheese, I love truffle oil. The combination is electrifying. This is a must try. \n\nI had the veal chop, and let me tell you that each bite sent shivers down my spine. I let out a slight moan every time I would put a piece of meat in my mouth. The veal was so tender, and the flavoring. Succulent. Each bite sent me closer and closer to nirvana. \n\nMy friend had the duck, which I asked her to order. OMFG, Excellent. Divine. Fantabulous. I could go on and on. The duck was perfect. It was tender but had just the right amount of gamey-ness to it. When I go back again, I don't know if I'll have the veal or duck. Both were excellent. \n\nBobby Flay has always been known for his robust flavors and I have to say that I\"m hitting myself in the head for not trying his restaurants before. Every dish I tried was just amazing. Each bite is like fireworks in your mouth."

The place was already booked well in advance (damn) but lucky for us, we were able to secure some great seats at the bar.  Frankly, I think you get great (attentive) service at the bar because you're right in the face of the bartender - hard to be ignored right?\n\nI came here with my partner on the recommendation of a colleague.  She was right.  I really liked it.  Okay, the prices were a bit ridonkulous but I'm a foodie and will pay up from time to time. \n\nWe started out with the tiger shrimp tamale - an appetizer large enough to share.  Tasty, yummy, damn fine masa.\n\nMy partner got the filet (he asked everyone).  It was an expensive but expansive cut of meat.  The crusted exterior softly cut through to a medium rare center.  I don't think I've seen a filet mignon cooked as close to perfection as this one.  The spicy crust was incredible.\n\nAs for me, I went vegie, which I never do, but was really thinking that the chile relleno with eggplant looked interesting.  It was and is was good.  It's hard to describe this monstrosity of goodness.  It was huge and I ate every damn bit of it.  \n\nWe felt compelled to get a side dish (twice baked potato) but really upon reflection, it was unnecessary.  Our bill capped out at close to $200 with drinks but the experience was worth it.\n\nI'd give it five stars but the location inside Caesers left a (lot) to be desired.  You can't really truly away from the casino vibe even in a well-appointed restaurant."

Honestly, PASS on the endless buffets and make a reservation for Mesa Grill. I don't know how everybody else does it with a full on 3-course meal--appetizers, side dishes, desserts and all--but the entree alone had me STUFFED and knocked me out cold once I got back to my hotel (it could have also been the Cactus Pear margarita I got...) PORK TENDERLOIN, that is all you need to know when ordering and don't even think about second guessing yourself. It may look like 3 itty pieces of meat, but trust me, those 3 bites go a loooong way. Every single bite of the perfectly marinated piece of pork topped with bourbon and ancho chile sauce was another step closer to heaven. And yes, I ultimately reached that heaven at the end of my meal because I haven't stopped thanking the Iron Chef gods for blessing Bobby Flay with an outstanding recipe. My boyfriend's chipotle glazed rib eye was also generously served fresh out the kitchen and had grill marks that left a beautiful shine to the meat and even a better taste in my mouth! Oh, and the side of mashed potatoes we got? Freakin' delicious. Literally reminded me of buttered popcorn that's been softened and beat to goodness! \n\nThus, save that money you might lose gambling anyways and spend it towards dinner here. The odds are, you're gonna have a winning meal! Mesa Grill. Las Vegas. Place your bets. NOW."

Did we just get rejected at the Buffet? LOL. Truth be told, I was a bit relieved since I didn't want to eat at a buffet that night. Since we were already at Caesar's Palace and we had plans to go to XS that night, we ended up at Mesa Grill. We got seated immediately by the nice, smiling hostess. I'm surprised they let me in because I looked like a bum that day with my jean shorts and bright tank top.\n\nWe started off with an assortment of bread-jalapeno, jalapeno corn muffin, a nutty bread, and sourdough? I didn't taste all the bread so my bread descriptions suck. Of course, I need an adult beverage so I ordered Duvel, a golden ale. I love my Belgian beers! It was Restaurant Week at the time so my friend and her sis ordered something from the RW menu. Nothing really caught my eye on the RW menu so I decided to get the Ancho-Chile honey-glazed salmon (cooked medium). We shared the tuna nachos with mango, habanero hot sauce, & avocado crema for an appetizer. Wow, get the tuna nachos!\n\nMy friend and her sister ordered the chopped salad, grilled Berkshire pork porterhouse chop, Sixteen Spiced chicken, Tres Leches cake, and the salted caramel chocolate pudding. My salmon was cooked perfectly with the slight crispiness and flakiness on the outside and slightly under cooked and tender in the middle. It's exactly the way I prefer my salmon. The bold Southwestern flavor combination had a slight kick and all the flavors of black beans, tomatillos, and roasted jalapeno crema blended well together. Not only did it taste amazing, the bold, vibrant colors were so pretty to look at. I had a bite of everything. Every single thing was delicious! To end the meal, the salted caramel chocolate pudding put a smile on my face. it was so decadent and not overly sweet. I wanted to lick the bowl but that wouldn't look right in public so I didn't. \n\nOur server Joel was professional, friendly, courteous, and even noticed my friend spilled some sticky sugar water on her purse and wiped if off for her. We all didn't notice. I didn't pay too much attention to the decor. It just looks like any fancy restaurant on the Strip. I did notice most people were dressed so I felt slightly uncomfortable there with my casual attire. If I had known I was coming here, I would have dressed up!\n\nMesa Grill is a prime example of what a celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip should be - world class service from all employees as well as a fancy, clean atmosphere to enjoy your delicious, pricey Vegas meal!"

Not really anything special there, aside from the fancy-cut chips. They were good, but not mind-blowing.

It had great depth of flavor and spice -- it also had kind of a vinegar-y kick to it that balanced out the starchy sweetness of the potato. Awesome dish.\n\nThe New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin sandwich was also a great choice. The pork was perfectly cooked, and the sauce and arugula complemented the tender pork.\n\nGreat meals both times I've been here -- and worth the slightly high price tag to say you've been to one of Bobby's restaurants."

I ordered the spicy scrambled eggs with jalepenos and I believe creme fraiche on top with a side of ham.  The eggs were so fluffy and soft.  The ham was just a little sweet but was best thing on the plate.  There were more biscuits on this plate maybe buttermilk ones, very tasty.  Also got a  choice of grits or fries, I chose the grits.  They were creamy and rich. He got the pork tenderloin sandwich which they press and use cold pork tenderloin, I'm assuming the same tenderloin they may use for the dinner.  It was seasoned with New Mexican flavors, spread with a flavored mayo and topped with onions.  It also came fries.  We split each of our entrees to get more variety.\n\nA lot of people ordered the burger around us and I must say that looked pretty tasty.

The margaritas were good and the sticky toffee pudding was absolutely delicious!! It did not disappoint! \n\nThe only reason I'm doing 4 stars instead of 5 is because of atmosphere.

I agree with the yelper that the side corn tamale was average at best, lacked flavor, and really small for $9. Our corn bread that came out before dinner was very dry as well. What I was most dissappointed by was their lack of ability to make a change to an item on the menu.  I wanted to get the quesadillas without chicken that looked amazing and we were told they couldn't do it, that stuff was pre-made. That was a bummer. So we settled for the goat cheese fundido app and a tamale. Like i said the tamale was not so hot and the goat cheese fundido was good. At that point we cut our losses and took off and never got to the chile relleno which I kind of regret based on what other yelper said.\n\n I know this place is mostly a meat type of restaurant but my wife and I love the spice and flavor Mesa brings to the table. For some reason I recall more vegetarian options at the Mesa Grill in New York or maybe they were more willing to adapt. \n\nTheir $16 specialty margarita was just ok. Oh, and they could use some customer service training up front. Not so friendly, in a cold and indifferent kind of way. Just annoying when you see them laughing and upbeat with servers but not customers. Oh well, at least our server Arnel was nice."

Both were delicious, though I think I preferred the latter a lot more simply due to the flavor and texture of the club sandwich.  The flavor was nice and even though the portions here were huge, the club didn't feel nearly as heavy as the pork sandwich.  The southwestern fries that came with the sandwich was absolutely awesome though.  I could have filled up just eating that alone.  \n\nThe service here was decent and the ambiance was very nice.  I liked the spacious feel of the restaurant and I think this is one of the better places to dine at, especially if you like gambling at Caesars or just want to eat somewhere close to the Coliseum if you're planning to catch a show there."

We have had many superb lunches, but this dinner fell flat.\n\nThe appetizers were fine, which made the main courses that much more disappointing.  Our group ordered:\n\nThe chile-crusted rabbit with a bedding of cous-cous -- the rabbit was cooked perfectly, but the natural flavor of the protein could not be discerned.  I've had a fair bit of rabbit and red squirrel in my day, and enjoy the flavors; our dining companion did not get that chance, the flavor was lost in his dish.\n\nAnother of our group had the Mahi-Mahi and declared it well cooked but under-seasoned.  \n\nThe third member of our table had the evening's special, the arctic char.  It was perfectly cooked with the skin crisped expertly and presented skin-up to preserve the texture.  The flavor of the protein was the star of this dish and we declared this the only success of the night.\n\nI had the pork tenderloin.  Eager to ease into the palate of flavors (boubon sauce, a touch of the habenero drizzle) I started with just a piece of the pork.  The rub utterly masked any porky goodness and left a sort-of spicy dirt aftertaste.  By cutting a piece of pork, ensuring a light coating of the bourbon sauce and a dash of the habenero sauce, I could \"get\" what the creator of the recipe had in mind.  Sadly, you could have rubbed a piece of soggy cardboard and then dipped the sauces to pretty much good effect.  Unfortunately, I wanted a wonderful protein to be the star, enhanced by some clever sauce choices.  The sweet potato tamale needed something to cut the cloying sweetness (yes, I know they're called sweet potatoes for a reason).\n\nThis might have been a one-star event, were it not for the skilled wait and bus staff and the wonderful arctic char.  For at least these reasons, we'll be taking Mesa Grill off our dining destination rotation in the future."

The service was friendly and quick, the food phenomenal, the drinks so-so.\n\nThe food:\n\nBread basket was filled with walnut bread, asiago cheese bread, and blue corn muffins. All were tasty, but the corn muffin was crumbly.\n\nAppetizer: shrimp tamale! Omg! The shrimp were perfectly cooked and enrobbed in a cream sauce. The Masa dough tasted like delicious corn bread with a hint of sweetness.\n\nEntr\u00e9es: seared tuna over a bed of the best couscous I have ever eaten. It was buttery and the right amount of salty. It contained toasted pine nuts that added the perfect crunch. My Sig other ordered the spice rubbed chicken served with cilantro mashed potatoes. The meat was perfectly cooked: tender and juicy. My Sig other's mother ordered the ribeye which came with flays signature adobo sauces. The sauces were winners: perfectly tangy and sweet and hot. Incredibly balanced.\n\nDessert: I ordered the pistachio brown butter cake with strawberry ice cream. Omg! The ice cream was some of the best I have ever had. It tasted like concentrated strawberries. I usually only like cookie or candy ice creams, but this was so smooth and creamy. The cake itself was moist and rich. I don't regret those calories at all. My sig other's mom had the coconut tres leches cake--it was rich and decadent but at the same time light. \n\nDrinks: nothing to write home about. I was expecting something a little more playful from Bobby flay. Maybe some spicy cocktails. \n\nIn sum: go to this restaurant! You will have a memorable meal."

I think it was a really good poblano sauce.  Excellent flavor and loved the tomatillo salsa on top of the fish.  Note to self (or whoever wants to listen): order fish well done.  I ordered mine medium this time and it was a little too underdone in the middle for my tastes.\n\nSophie's Chopped Salad - eh, I could take it or leave it.  Big chunks of cheese in the salad and the dressing was good but not OMG good.\n\nPork tenderloin sandwich - OMG good.  Spicy sauce with expertly seasoned and tender pork, great bread.\n\nRoasted beet and grapefruit salad - EXCELLENT.  \n\nService was great for us, but that is such a subjective thing because someone two tables over from us was hard-core bitching.  They had ordered appetizers, ate the appetizers, then put their order for lunch in and were whining because they saw that we had gotten our salads before their lunch order came out.  Wah, cry about it.  The manager came over and handled that little situation, but we were not disappointed with the service whatsoever.

It was good.)\n\nBread basket - I only ate one slice since I didn't want to ruin my meal, but I thought the bread was average - the butter they served with it was noticeably good, though.\n\nAppetizer - 'Rough Cut Tuna Nachos':  I have no idea what is 'nacho' about this appetizer, but if you like tuna tartare you will love this appetizer.  The capers, the mango puree, the little chips they served to scoop it up with - all super delicious.  The tuna was high quality.\n\nEntree - 'Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon' - delicious!  My steak was cooked perfectly, was a great cut of meat, and the coffee and ancho chile on the outside really added a lot of flavor.  This was a big win for me.\n\nSide - 'Fresh Corn Tamale + Jalapeno Pesto Butter' - I was not a fan of this.  The tamale was not very moist, and basically tasted like a plain corn tamale that you would get at any regular Mexican restaurant - I didn't really get any flavor from the jalapeno pesto butter that was on it, either.. I can't believe I paid ten bucks for a crappy plain tamale!  \n\nDessert - 'Churros' - not so great.  These churros were pretty weak - they were not fluffy, there was no slightly gooey center and crispy outer.  The sauces were also not very good - there was barely any sauce served with the churros (dunking was impossible) and neither of the sauces had strong (or notable) flavor - I would have preferred one small creamer pot of good mexican chocolate for dipping.\n\nService was very good - our waiter had the right frequency of checking in, and was very tolerant of us being one of the last people in the restaurant.\n\nReally, I want to give Mesa Grill 3 or 3.5 stars because of the inconsistency in quality of dishes across all parts of dinner, but on the strength of the appetizer and main dish, I will go ahead and give them 4 stars..  I found the pricing to be appropriate to slightly on the high side (but not so expensive where I felt like the food was overpriced)."

At that moment, we found ourselves in front of Mesa Grill and walked up to the bar.\n\nI have been to Mesa many times before, but the first time we just decided to just sit at the bar instead of getting a table. I actually found my experience at the bar far more enjoyable and oddly enough, a lot cheaper than usual. They only have an appetizer menu at the bar, but when all of the food is good like it is at Mesa, it really isn't a big deal and there is something for everyone. The only disappointment was they had taken their calamari off the menu (both the bar and standard menu)... Sad considering I was really looking forward to it.\n\nWhile we were there, some random guy who is completely drunk and blitzed out of his mind, walks right up to us and goes on and on about this magician, Chris Randall, that he knows and who works at Mesa. He was shocked we had no idea who this magician was and for the next 15 minutes, he repeatedly was saying that we had to Google Chris Randall. He then gets the bartender involved and repeats his tirade. The bartender doesn't know anyone who works there by that name. The drunk guy asks for the manager and repeats the tirade again. No one knows who he is talking about, he gives us random door passes to some club (yes, the same ones they pass out on the bridges between the hotels) and he promptly leaves. It was pretty funny because he was just annihilated drunk. And yes... when I got home from my trip, I did Google the guy's name (turns out he is a local Vegas magician). LOL\n\nAnywho, if you haven't tried the bar at Mesa Grill, you should definitely check it out. The service is great, the appetizers at Mesa are a foodies bar food, and if your lucky, you will get some random drunk strike up a conversation to where you can laugh about the experience with the bartender for the rest of the night."

One tamale was $16 (I think), but it WAS good!  I thought there wasn't nearly enough sauce, so I asked for more, which the chef made up special for us at no extra charge.  I used half of the side of sauce and mmm'd my way to the last bite of that delicious appetizer.  My husband ordered the same tamale and before he was halfway through it, he called the server over to order a second one for himself.  The server brought my husband extra sauce without a second request!  Awesome!  We drank a delicious Cactus Pear Margarita with our \"dinner,\" which was trickily sweet... it went down VERY easy!  We split a third.  In all, we would go back for the tamale and margarita.  But the bill... ouch!  3 tamales & 3 margaritas added up to $100!  You'd better win a little gambling before eating here!"

First off, the service was impeccable - the wait staff was extremely attentive, and our waitress knew the menu very well. She was well versed in the gluten free items on the menu (almost the entire menu, besides a few things were gf) - she answered all the questions that my sister-in-law who has food allergies asked without hesitation. The ambiance was wonderful, it wasn't too loud, and as a party of 7 we were sat in a rounded table, which made it possible for all of us to communicate. As for the food, every item that came to our table was INCREDIBLE! There was not one item that wasn't full of flavor or perfectly cooked. Highly recommend this place if you are in Vegas!"

Our appetizer, Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\"  was creative and very good. Daughter ordered Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash. This too was very simple, creative dish as expected with Flay perfection. \nWish I had been more adventurous, went with a Mesa Burger.\n\nBurger was ordered as 'medium'. Got served with cold fry's and they replaced it in a timely fashion. Very disappointed with the Burger...... it was way over cooked, heavy char-grill. Now running out of time to leave for airport, did not bother calling server. Left it uneaten with couple of bites. Told server of my order and he just ignored it with no apology not did he offer to take it off the bill.\n\nTaking it off the check is not an issue, in my opinion, prices are very reasonable. other wise it was a good experience, but the burger and the server's attitude left a sour note."

My dinner when I went to Bar Americain was exceptional and I was expecting the same at Mesa Grill, but I think that my expectations were a little high.  \n\nWhat we ordered between the two of us:\n- Tiger Shrimp Tamale\n- Sophie's Chopped Salad\n- Mesa Burger\n- Pork Tenderloin Sandwich\n- Buttermilk Pineapple Upside Down Cake\n- Chocolate Chip Strawberry Shortcake (dessert of the day)\n\nPositives....\n- The tiger shrimp tamale was amazing.  By far my favorite thing that I have had at a Bobby Flay restaurant.  The shrimp was almost undercooked but was done enough to eat.  The filling of the tamale was sweet and there was an under tone of Flay's famous heat in the sauces.  The corn-cilantro cream sauce was perfect to accent the tamale.\n- You could taste the quality of the meat of the burger.  It was exceptional and cooked perfectly.  You can hardly get your mouth around it because it is so large!  \n- The cake itself in the pineapple upside down cake was moist and delicious.\n- As always, the fries and Flay's restaurants are great!  We had the southwestern fries with our meals and then were spicy but good!\n\nNegatives:\n- First off the server was an absolute snob so we got unlucky there.  I would have given this post 4 stars but took one away because of the server.  \n- The pork tenderloin sandwich was served with the meat freezing cold.  I was very surprised by this.  The sandwich would have been much better if the meat wasn't cold.\n- When our server brought Flay's \"famous\" bread basket to our table there were only two cold muffins in it that were clearly left from the night before.  One of my favorite parts of my Flay meal in the past was the variety of breads in the basket.  The tables around us got a variety like I expected to get.  I attribute this to our sucky server.\n\nOverall the meal was a positive one but I don't know if I will be back to Mesa Grill in the future but I definitely recommend the restaurant to any Bobby Flay fans that would like to experience his southwestern flavors."

We could only afford to do a couple of the celebrity chef restaurants, and scheduled this for a nice lunch on our last day in Vegas.\n\nI am sad to say that the food did not live up to the prices or the hype.  i had a chicken and avocado quesadilla that was overcooked and something I could have easily made myself at home.  My wife had the yucatan chicken tacos, which were three TINY tacos and again nothing special.   We each drank non-alcoholic drinks and the bill came to over $40 for sub-par food.  (As a side note, we love a good meal and are not afraid to spend a lot of money for truly quality food, but this was not hte case.)\n\nA couple of positive points to note:  the atmosphere and space is quite nice and a quiet respite inside the Caesar's casino.  I also suspect their cocktails are quite tasty, as is their signature appetizer the Queso Fundido.  However, our experience was quite poor.\n\nIt's likely a better visit if Mr. Flay is in the kitchen when you happen to be there, but on a whole, I would leave this one off of your list of places to visit.  Vegas is full of some of the country's BEST restaurants in terms of food and service.  Spend your money elsewhere."

The sweet potato tamale with crush pecan butter was a perfect side for the tenderloin. The portion sizes were also good.

We made the mistake of showing up for dinner at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night, only to find out that we would have to wait until 10:30pm for a seat! So we had to make a reservation for the following night, which threw off our agenda a little. Just be sure to make your reservation at least a day ahead, and they will secure it with a credit card.\n\n2) if you want to have dessert, you may want to skip the assorted bread basket that they bring out before your entree arrives. It's hard to resist, but you won't have room for dessert if you eat the breads. They are filling."

I wouldn't normally consider eating at Mesa Grill unless it was Las Vegas Restaurant week, but I'm glad I got to experience it with them. The Southwestern flavors really shine through all their entrees, but I was probably most impressed with the corn bread. The restaurant itself is spacious and you feel removed from the hustle and bustle of the casino just outside. Service is outstanding, as to be expected. I say if you're a local, eat here at least once, and if you're a tourist, consider this a place to head to for dinner before your wild Vegas night."

We had two servers working together which made service incredibly fluid and we appreciated that. The shrimp tamale was creative, really tasty, and lots of texture. The shrimp was perfectly cooked (read not chewy) and the tamales were great -- you could really taste the masa. The corn-cilantro sauce was super flavorful as well. The crispy squash blossoms were so damn good. Filled with ricotta and corn with a slightly sweet and spicy pepper sauce, the squash blossoms were perfectly fried yet not oily. For entrees we had the blue corn crusted halibut and the fire roasted veal chop and ordered a side of mashed potatoes with cilantro pesto. Delicious!! The halibut was moist and flaky, with a crust of basil and oregano and a layer of sweet tomatoes. Yum! The veal chop was perfectly seared and had a maple glaze and wild rice and sage butter side. I wanted to gnaw on the chop bone all night! The mashed potatoes were also good and the cilantro added a great flavor. \n\nThe misses: I found the blue corn bread to be completely crumbly. The butter was rock hard so when I tried to spread a bit of it on the bread everything crumbled. The first cocktail my friend ordered was a pomegranate martini...easy enough with simple ingredients, but instead the bartender used Stirrings brand Pomegranate martini mix. Ugh...totally ruined the taste and gave it an overly sweet and unnatural taste. How could a restaurant held in such high regard use such a cheap ingredient? I expect more when I am paying almost $15 for a martini. And so should you! \n\nOtherwise a great experience. Some wackiness around us, but an interesting and flavorful dining experience."

The fundito was great. The black bean quesadilla was great. \n\nWe shared the salmon and the pork loin were both good but not great. The side of corn was also good but not great. Over all I wild day this place is good not great. \n\nWent be back because of the prices vs what you get. \n\nService was excellent."

You've might of heard of the owner, a guy named Bobby Flay? \n\nOk, so this restaurant is not so small, in fact it's huge!  But not in size, in popularity and for good reason!\n\nThe service was fantastic, the design of the place is spectacular, and the food?  OMG!!!  The food is some of the best we have ever tasted in a very long time!  Everything that we ordered was perfect and yummy!\n\nWe started off with appetizers:\n\nYucatan Chicken Tacos Grilled Red Onion +Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce \nGoat Cheese \"Queso Fundido Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips \n\nOMG!!  Amazing!!\n\nI ordered:\n\nMango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak\nGreen Peppercorn-Green Chile Sauce + Toasted Pine nut Cous Cous \n\nMy husband ordered:\n\nNew Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin\nBourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter \n\nThe Tuna was cooked to perfection as was the Pork Tenderloin.  The sauces that went with these dishes were amazing and I can see why Bobby Flay is one of the best Chef's in the World!  My Tuna came with Couscous which had a taste that was indescribable and cooked to perfection, and My husbands Pork Tenderloin had a Sweet Potato Tamale that came with it that was so delicious it was like eating desert along with your main course!\n\nWe shared desert.  A Banana Creme Pie!  Yummy right?  Not as impressive as the rest of the dinner, but good at that.  Wasn't real sweet and seemed to be lacking something.\n\nBut all in all our time spent at the Mesa Grill was a Fantastic one, and we will go back again and again"

Our waitress, who had worked in the restaurant since the day they opened, was passionate and insightful about what to drink and what to eat.\n\nPlanning ahead that I was likely to enter into a \"Food-coma\" our party of four tried to pace ourselves while also sampling what we hoped were the best dishes the restaurant had to offer.\n\nTo begin our meal, we sampled two different margaritas.  One was a original version and one a Cactus Pear version.  Both were delicious and quite strong.\n\nOur waitress started us off with a bread basket filled with blue-corn muffins, jalapeno cheddar roles, and even more types indescribable bread that likely will have you begging for more before your drinks even arrive.\n\nFor appetizers, we selected the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, the Spicy Tuna + Salmon Tartares, and Sophie's Chop Salad.  The Tamale was one of the greatest appetizers I have ever eaten and the actual corn tamale stuffing itself was licked dry.  The Tartares were spicy yet packed with flavor and came with plantain chips that were sweet and crispy.  The Salad was OK flavor-wise but had really nice textures and was a big in size.\n\nFor our entrees, we each tired something different.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, which was served with an amazingly flavorful sweet potato tamale.  The pork was perfectly cooked, ultra juicy and was demolished off of the plate rather quickly.  The other three entrees chosen consisted of Blue Corn Crusted Halibut, Sixteen Spice Chicken, and a special of Tempura Soft Shell Crab.  Each dish was completely devoured, along with a side dish of a Chile Relleno, which I wish we had ordered two of.  If given a choice of my second favorite entree (the Pork was first), I would definitely choose the Chicken.\n\nDessert is always a must when dining with me, so as a table we decided to split three of them.  The Strawberry Shortcake, the Mango-Blackberry Crostada, and the Cookie Sampler.  Once again, everything suddenly was missing, despite our stomachs at capacity level.\n\nThe service was phenomenal from beginning to end, and once our waitress found out we were celebrating my graduation, she brought over a small dish of pineapple ice cream with a candle.\n\nIf you happen to find yourself in Las Vegas, please do yourself a favor and stop by Mesa Grill.  I promise the food will be some of the best you've ever tasted!"

I had New York strip as well as shared a blue corn duck appetizer and a bottle of wine.  The steak was easily by far the best steak I have had in my life.  I actually closed my eyes while chewing.  I love steak and am a bit of a cook myself but this was just heaven.  I could have eaten two of them.  The appetizer was very nice as well and interesting.  Even the bread that was served has some chili taste in it and was nice.  I also sampled the pork tenderloin and thought it was very good but I am a steak man and usually I would order something like a ribeye which is pretty much guaranteed to have flavor but Bobby Flay being from New York and all I decided to go with the New York strip.  Boy was it a life changing steak!!!!  It was 48$ for the steak and I think the two of us got out of the joint for around 200$ with one appetizer one dessert and a bottle of nice red wine.  I would absolutely be back to eat the same steak again.  It came with a red and green MESA sauce....I will probably order a bottle as I think they sell it separately.  Wow what a steak!  If you thought Bobby Flay was hype then you were very wrong my friend."

We arrived around 7pm and their first reservation time for two people wasn't until 9:45pm but we were only in town for about one whole day so we took it.  We hung outside of Caesar's at a bar while we waited for our table and when we showed up at 9:30pm, we finally got seated.  We split a fantastic bottle of the cheapest red zinfandel we could find on the menu and it was well worth the $40!  We shared the queso fundito as an appetizer and it was really great.  The addition of the goat cheese gave it a nice tangy bite and cut the richness just enough.  I ordered the salmon for dinner and it was great as well - cooked perfectly with a nice crust on the outside.  We got some collared greens as a side and they were garlicy and tasty.  Overall it was a good meal and I have to give Bobby some props...even though he seems like kind of a creep in real life.  Well done!"

The result was an undercooked steak, relative to my wife's very specific instructions. My selection of rabbit with risotto was good, but nothing extraordinary. Our overall experience was \"so-so\" food, not prepared to our request, and very high prices. There are far better places in Las Vegas.

After becoming addicted to the Food Network's competition shows I was excited to eat at a Bobby Flay restaurant - and Caesar's is always fun to walk through.\n\nWe had 10:45 a.m. reservations for the Saturday brunch - it's our lunch hour our in our home time zone! We each ordered an appetizer. The Tiger Shrimp and Corn Tamale is worth writing home about - amazing flavors in this unconventional tamale. Also tried the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido as the suggestion of the waiter - another home run. I was in the mood for a burger so I got the Mesa Burger - very good, the grilled Vidalia onions were the secret to the taste for me. The fries were not as good as I had hoped, but by that point I was so full that was fine. My husband ordered off the specials - a six shrimp / two tortilla taco plate served with three sauces - a guacamole spread, mango puree and green tomatillo. We both liked the mango the best. The guacamole was great on the burger.\n\nThis visit to Mesa Grill reinforced why Bobby Flay get's the accolades he gets - you must eat here."

Both were really good. I usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe I've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.\n\nWe had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients. \n\nService was slow, although our server apologized because it was really busy. I would return, but not before I try other places on the strip."

Entrees ordered at our table was the tenderloin and chicken.  Both were great!  The tenderloin is super spicy, but it hits your palate a little later.  All the food was incredible.  And oh my goodness, the bread!  I know, what's exciting about bread?!  Blue corn muffins...yes please!!!  The others were raisin bread and a jalapeno bread.  Awesome!!  My husband and I were still talking about it the next day!\n\nServing staff was friendly and attentive and never let our water glasses go empty.  The only complaint I had was that the person taking the plates away actually took them while we were still eating on them.  My example: we finished off the goat cheese appetizer and still had about 5 or 6 chips left on the plate.  The guy (not our waiter) came over and took our plate while I still had a chip in my hand, clearly it was still eating.  Now, granted I wasn't assertive and didn't say anything.  \n\nOverall good experience!  I would visit again if I come back to Vegas!!\n\n(Love Bobby Flay's recipes on Food Network!)"

But I'm sure the tentative, cheerful and helpful staff would suggest them.\n\nCan't find fault here. Food here was well prepared and was also exciting. Well done Bobby Flay.

I don't particularly like this. The pork tenderloin was almost room temperature. It's very flavorful and the sauce is great but had a gross pork aftertaste. The tamales are hit or miss as sometimes it will be moist and other times will be dry.  Newbies should try it. Blue corn pancake was okay. His breads aren't that great. Margaritas are average."

What we ordered:\n\n1. tuna tartare nachos- the tuna was so incredibly fresh. The sauces and chips that accompanied the dish were so flavorful.  Only complaint is that the tuna seemed a tad bland.. like it needed to be accompanied with avocado chunks or a little more seasoning to break up the texture of the big chuck pieces of tuna.\n\n2. chicken tacos- that peanut BBQ sauce was HEAVENLY. The grilled red onions were perfection. I would definitely order this again and would love to learn how to make that peanut sauce at home. \n\n3. the shrimp corm tamale- honestly, it was good but not amazing. The corn pieces were so sweet and plump, one of the best corn I have ever had but the tamale itself wasnt that great.\n\n4. Lamp Chops- AMAZING, OUSTANDING, INCREDIBLE. One of the best lamp chops I have ever had. I highly reccomend them.\n\n5. Filet Mignon with Coffee Rub- Such an amazing combination. The flavor of coffee with high quality meat just melts in your mouth. Such cool flavors. Such a nice feeling when you think to yourself that you have never tasted anything like this before. We also ordered the mashed potatoes to accompany this dish and those were just heaven. Creamy, buttery goodness.\n\nVery nice romantic meal in Vegas with the boo. I would definitely like to come back here."

The steaks are totally awesome, my kids have graduated from burgers from her to steaks and these are 10 and 12 year old kids, they are growing food snobs and know good steak from bad steak. I guess I've taught them too well because they use this place as one of their benchmarks where ever we go. the tamale is great and can be a desert but it's a side dish!!!! We had the churro for desert and oh wow!!!!! It beats a lot of good churros from the neighborhood back home in east la and Pasadena. The deserts are sooooo good, they make you want more!!!

Luckily, it was the beginning of restaurant week, so I got to try a variety of things for $50.\n\nThe Strawberry Fields cocktail drink was quite lovely with fresh strawberries, mint, and cucumber vodka.  Pink, sweet, and refreshing after walking around all day in the heat! :)  \n\nI must say the breads were WONDERFUL.  They were not your average breads.  We were given an assortment of three...I can't remember exactly what they were...but one was almost like a soft corn meal muffin with bits of herbs inside, another was more of a chewy bread with jalapeno bits, the last had raisin bits.  All different and unique.  I had to stop myself from eating the entire basket.\n\nThe roasted corn soup was SOOO good.  It was slightly spicy, creamy as can be, and incredibly sweet. The fried okra bits and green chile sauce (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had the grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from the corn, creaminess of the sauce. \n\nThe New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  The three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how the tamale from the shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with the slight crunch of the pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from the appetizer and soup.  \n\nFor dessert I had the roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  The shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nOne thing I would have hoped for was for the dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  The food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit the New York location. \n\nI never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props."

Which is almost crazy to say.\n\nWe arrived, no reservations, with a group of 8 people and were seated in groups of 4 right next to each other. No drinks for us, but ordered the queso fundido to start - goat cheese and bell peppers melted in a cast iron skillet with blue corn tortilla chips - excellent.\n\nOrdered up the spicy chicken sweet potato hash with poached eggs, the chilaquiles, spicy srambled eggs, and egg enchiladas. Before we get to the main food, lets talk about the baked basket you get.\n\nThis is hands down the best baked goods basket I've ever had in my life (even the fact that it was free). First off, the jalapeno cornbread was like eating small atom bombs good with sweet cream butter. There was a veggie corn muffin which I can't even describe and some sort of blueberry coffee bar which basically was so good i didn't even get to try more than a morsel before it was snapped up. No joke, I could have just ordered two more baked baskets and been very happy. Did I mention it was free?\n\nOn to the main attractions: I ordered the spicy chicken sweet potato with poached egg and green chili hollandaise. Seriously, this was the most unexpected dish I have ever had. The chicken and sweet potato is fused into a sort of loose biscuit with a perfectly runny poached egg, and served with a spicy (but good) hollandaise. I couldn't stop eating it. Seriously, I'd say this is one of the most original and delicious plays on eggs benedict I've ever had. Go for it.\n\nThe egg enchilada was a bit underwhelming and dry, and sort of sparse for the dish - luckily we had plenty of other food. The spicy scrambled eggs, were exactly as they sound - spicy scrambled eggs, but very delicious. And finally the chilaquiles, which from my mexican friend who ordered it, were very authentic, crispy, and delicious. Our other table ordered more of the same, with one person ordering the slider-style burgers, and stating that it was the best burger she ever had (she is in fact, vegetarian). \n\nGot out under $30 a person, with quick service, delicious food, beautiful American-style clean sophistication to the dishes, and a seriously seriously full and satisfied tummy. Definitely a must-do."

I ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). My husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). I'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that I was going to order the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash. \n\nThe bread was really nice. I liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. It was spicy and yummy.\n\nWe ordered the queso fundido to start. It was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. YUMOLA!!!! This was delicious.\n\nOur entrees arrived and I cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. That's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. A solid white, runny yolk is the norm. The hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. They were clearly undercooked. My husband got the pork tenderloin sandwich and we were surprised to see it came cold.  I took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. Our 2 other companions enjoyed their Mesa Burgers.\n\nI sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. A manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. I cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  But the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  Why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? I can do it and I can't cook worth shite.  So, the manager came back to ask how it was and I told him I've been waiting months to come here and I'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. So he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. Nice, but not what I wanted for my birthday lunch.\n\nEven though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. We looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  Disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars."

One of my English father's favorite side dishes and they were usually cooked beyond recognition in our home. As part of my master plan to enjoy and appreciate all foods, especially those I've avoided since childhood, I've started ordering it every time I see it on the menu.  This has worked very well at the Farm Caf\u00e9 in Portland, but not so much at Aureole in NYC. There they served it as a pur\u00e9e and boy that was some rough going. But Bobby Flay and his team managed to move me from toleration to adoration of this long avoided vegetable. Maybe it was the addition of toasted pecans and pomegranate seeds? \n\nVegas is a weird mix of upscale and low rent, but this restaurant managed to walk the line as a casually nice place. Expensive, but not ridiculous in the context of the Vegas price scale, and I felt the food and service made it feel like money well spent. Aside from one flickering light above our table (that they were very apologetic about) our service was wonderfully attentive.\n\nWe started with cocktails and I enjoyed the house Mesa Margarita and Mr. K upgraded, per usual, to one of the higher end variations. Both were nice, especially when coupled with our Crispy Squid appetizer and the wonderful selections from the bread tray. Three diverse choices, but I especially enjoyed the walnut bread.\n\nFor our entrees, I chose the Grilled Mahi Mahi and Mr. K had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. Mine was filled with subtle flavor and texture, but the pork had a nice kick. Enough that you probably want to think twice about ordering it if you like things mild. The sides are served family style and in addition to the brussel sprouts, the chili relleno was very good, but the mashed potatoes weren't memorable.\n\nOf all the places we dined, this was a place where we were contemplating returning for dinner the very next day.  And our dining companions managed to do just that. I'm jealous."

At least a few days in advance, too. The place is jumping, and without a reservation you probably won't get a table. Anyway...My boyfriend and I had the cactus pear margaritas (They don't have them on the menu, but ask your server about the specialty margs and this will be one of them). They were amaaaaazing!!!! For starters, I got the baby Romaine salad, which was so so so good. I loved the parmesan crouton type things so much that my server surprised me with an entire plate of them!!! is it healthy to eat an entire plate of fried cheese? Probably not....but who cares because it f*cking ROCKED!!! Then, I got the ancho chile honey glazed salmon, and my boyfriend had the seared tuna. Both were outstanding, perfectly cooked (nothing worse than well done salmon), and beautifully plated! Unfortunately had no room for dessert, but it's my mission to get some the next time i'm in town! Which, might possibly be for this restaurant alone.."

One would think that, given Bobby Flay's status as a Iron Chef, his propensity to whore himself out for Food Network top billing, and his smattering of establishments around the country that the food would be appropriately awesome.  I wouldn't expect it to be, for example, Joel Robuchon or Thomas Keller good---but at least as good as any other celebrity chef restuarant in Vegas.\n\nMesa Grill, on the day I happened to dine there, was the worst restaurant I'd ever been to.  Easily.  I'm talking McDonald's bad.  Perhaps even Subway bad.  \n\nThe service was slow and forgetful.  There was plenty of staff to go around so nobody was over-committed with tables.  They were just slow.  And forgetful.  And slow.  I ordered a chicken and blackbean quesadilla for an appetizer.  I followed that with the spicy pork sandwich.\n\nBoth dishes were bland.  Very, very boring and bland.  There was no spice.  There was little flavor.  The presentation was tired, the flavors were muted, and the texture of all the food reminded me of fish cooked under a heat-lamp and then microwaved.  My pork sandwich was cooked RARE and served COLD.  Really?  I can understand, perhaps, serving the meat at room temperature but a cold, raw, pork sandwich shouldn't be served to dogs, much less paying guests.\n\nThe decor is nice.  The location is nice.  The drinks are good.  The menu has a nice selection---which serves to trick you into thinking the food is actually tasty, hot, and worth money.  If this restaurant is in any way representative of the Bobby Flay line of establishments then our dear Iron Chef needs to spend more time being a chef and less time playing one on TV.  \n\nI would never recommend anyone go here.  Trust the food blogs, critics, and professionals who have given Mesa Grill consistently low marks over the course of its Vegas run---it truly is a terrible restaurant and an embarassment to \"spicy\" and \"flavorful\" cuisine everywhere.  Shame on you Bobby Flay.  Shame."

Once the chef saw the chicken, the manager came to the table and apologized profusely and offered to fire another order which we declined, they did insist on comping the chicken. One of the things I really wanted to do in Vegas was to eat at Mesa because I have made many of Bobby's recipes in the past and love his flavors.

At 10:30 PM the place was still booming with patrons, which is a good sign.    We ordered the ceviche sampler, Mexican Rub Pork Tenderloin with sides of roasted tomato and horseradish mashed potato.   This was plenty for a late dinner for two.   Let's not forge the drinks.   Theres an extensive wine selection and the Black Widow Mojito was very yummy.\n\nWe love our raw fish but don't consider ourselves snobs about it.   But if we pay $22 for an appetizer, we do expect something pretty good.  Not so here.   Fish quality was so-so.  Maybe it couldn've helped if the dish was chilled a more.  We finished the plate in just a few bites so we felt like we swallowed our money without satisfaction.   Not a good feeling. \n\nThe pork tenderloin was on the other end of the spectrum.   It was THE best pork loin I have ever eaten.   So soft and juicy and rubbed with Mexican spices and a hint of sweet potato puree, the pork was a mouthful of savory flavor.    \n\nThe side roasted tomato was infused with light smokey flavor which was a lovely complement to the pork.   I'm usually not a tomato person, but cooked like this, I think I could eat a couple vines.   \n\nMashed potato is difficult to go wrong, but at Mesa, it is especially savory.  I love how its not like the tradition bacon and cheese topping.    A light horseradish flavor gives it just the right amount of kick which is cooled with a smooth chive-cream fraiche.   \nYummy!\n\nI think anyone who likes grilled meat and is looking for something different from the traditional steak should check out Mesa Grill.   Plus, the waitress told us Bobby Flay comes in about once a month.  Maybe you'll be luckier than us and actually see him!"

Almost everything on the menu has a bite to (except for the smoked salmon). Some dishes are spicy, some are not... It's really not all that spicy. I particularly liked the grits. It was sooo creamy. I don't want to know how many calories is in it, but then again, who can resist butter and cream?\n\nI ordered the lamb salad... I LOVE lamb. The spices rubbed on the lamb reminds me a lot of the spices from Northern China... Really yummy... the goat cheese sprinkled on the salad was a bit too powerful. The salad in itself was good. The greens were not swimming in dressing.\n\nBetween my friends and I we ordered 5 different dishes... one being a burger, which was very tasty...The bread bowl was really good...If only I could have ate bread all day... we had a variety of salty bisques and muffin like breads. They were delicious.\n\nService: Our initial server was VERY GOOD explaining to us the menu and Bobby Flay's cooking style... then suddenly they switched servers on us... he wasn't as good at answering some of our questions because many of my friends don't know who Bobby Flay is nor have they tried Southern style cuisine before.\n\nI'd love to go back to try other dishes. It's a great place for groups. We were lucky to get a booth that sat us quite comfortably. We also arrived at a non-peak hour for lunch, so we were luck y to be seated right away."

            "review": "I tried really hard to like it, but given my expectations, I'd have to say I'm sorely disappointed.\n\nNot to say the stuff wasn't tasty, because it was. But that's all it really was. It was not a religious experience or anything that I haven't had before. It was decent, unadventurous food at prices that flabbergasted me. If I'm paying for a name, I expect a distinctive meal and unfortunately I didn't get it on my visit.\n\nI liked the ambiance of the restaurant, though of course since it's in Vegas you get the occasional rowdy cheer from the betting area. Servers were fine but didn't seem as professional as I would have liked for dinner service in that they did a poor job of blending into the surroundings and made some odd seating decisions (shoved me and my friend into the back of the restaurant when there weren't that many guests at the time). Speaking of that the lighting in the very back of the restaurant is a bit underwhelming, though for the rest of the restaurant I felt it was just fine. The seating in the back was a bit closer than I would like, as people that were seated next to us during the course of the meal were far too close (leaning over in any way and there would be contact) and I could easily listen in on other conversations which I don't think is appropriate for the type of restaurant it is.\n\nSo onto the food:\n\nBread basket consisted of muffins, a jalapeno bread, and a raisin bread. The raisin bread had a vaguely fermented scent and was slightly soggy, so I wasn't quite sure what was up with that. The muffin was quite crumbly and didn't have much distinct flavor, which would be a theme for the rest of the night, as the jalapeno bread also lacked any semblance of heat to perk up my tastebuds. The bread basket was really nothing to write home about.\n\nI started off with the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ duck. Flavors were balanced well, if a bit reserved. The sauces were straightforward and somewhat banal. BBQ duck was sweet and the meat flaky, though I felt that the duck really lacked the sort of gameiness and distinctive flavor I associate with duck. If not for the texture and mouth feel someone could have told me it was some other mystery meat and I probably wouldn't have made much of a fuss. The blue corn tortilla was what you would expect, though a bit thicker than I would have liked. The microgreens that topped the appetizer were really unnecessary and contributed nothing to the dish and I wonder if maybe there was another decorative herb that would have had some impact on the flavors rather than just the appearance of the plate. All in all a fairly well-decorated plate but average tasting dish. Portion was extremely lacking.\n\nSince it was the holidays, my server informed me they were serving an exclusive dish consisting of pork chop with sweet potato and apple. I was intrigued and opted out of my original entree choice. The plate itself was decorated nicely and had a really homey, \"straight from grandma's house\" feel to it which I liked.  I wasn't sure if I made the right decision or not by choosing this, but the pork chop dish was tame at best. My server did inform me that there wouldn't be as much spice as the pork tenderloin dish they serve, but the double-cut pork chop itself didn't even have a strong porky flavor. The meat was drier than I would have liked. If they did any other sort of marinade or preparation for the meat, I couldn't taste it. The ancho-chile sauce it was paired with was a good, but again, very reserved match-- the dish had almost non-existent heat. I can't call anything on the dish bland and they were seasoned fairly well, it's just that nothing was particularly distinctive or elevated the ingredients. The sweet potatoes were sliced and served simply as is-- I'm guessing they were sauteed in a flavored butter of some sort, as it was still very firm and didn't taste exactly like you would expect sweet potato to taste like. I had been expecting a more thorough preparation or at least mashed sweet potato to fit a holiday theme, so I was a bit surprised to see how it was served-- but surprisingly the flavor was very unique, almost nutty. The roasted apple, stuffed with walnuts and cinnamon, was probably the star of the night and tasted great-- tart, fragrant, and not particularly sugary at all. A wonderful holiday treat. The portions on the dish were all well-sized, balanced, and appropriate.\n\nSo while Mesa Grill is probably worth another visit on my part, from what I could tell the exorbitant prices didn't justify what was served. I don't doubt they could have had an off day, but I was hoping the dishes would really pack significant flavor and everything was just a small blip on my tastebuds. Given Flay's reputation for stronger, bolder flavors, I expected more. And even if it wasn't Flay's flagship restaurant, I would still give the same verdict of good, but not great, food."

We chose a mid priced French pinot noir which was well received.\n\nCocktails at $15 + were pricey but good quality. Our starters of soup, salads and shrimp were unremarkable but no complaints. The entrees varied from lamb to crusted tuna and were generous portions without the need for sides. I personally chose the tuna and requested as rare as possible - I wasn't disappointed.\n\nWith coffee for all and one desert, our bill was $375 plus tip. The $100 coupon I was using was rather loudly announced to my guests which I didn't appreciate.  \n\nOverall, a pleasant dinner but I felt a little rushed for a restaurant of this quality."

I was sat at a table from the time i was sat at the table the waiter seemed to not be feeling me. I dont know why. literally he approaced my tabled with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered with me. i thought whatever just give me my food and ill be out. Let me tell you this man never came to check on me. i saw him when he took my order, when i asked for a new dish and that was it ill get to the rest. \n\nSo i ordered sophie or sophias salad something like that as I just wanted vegetables. it was ok needed more dressing and a cut of protein wouldnt have hurt.so im eating the salad and halfway through (its very small) when i see what can only be described as a produce sticker in the salad. ugghhhh so i waved him down (again this man never came to check on me) to tell him there was a piece of paper in the salad. he simply said oh ill take this back. I then see him walk all around the restaurant making stops with the tainted salad adn then he finally takes it back. he comes back about 5 minutes later and says they are going to get this to you as soon as they can. what you mean as soon as they can? its a barely there salad. the salad literally consisted of romaine, large blocks of white cheddar and some canned kidney and garbanzo beans and barely any dressing i say ok but im thinking what in the entire fIIK. there was NEVER and apology or any offer of a complimentary bread, 50cents off nothing!!\n\ni dont know what the people are called who refill but the man who kept refilling my water and brought my bread was phenomenal!! idk how restaurants work but he definitely needs to be a waiter instead of just water, appetizer man ..he was great not only did he refill be he checked on me appropriately as most restaurants at intervals asking if i was ok. He was great !! he seriously needs to be promoted to waiter if thats how it goes. i didnt catch his name ..he looked eritrean or ethiopian to me.\n\nso i finally finish the new salad and im just ready to get out of there at this point as i was over it. I waited and i waited and i waited and nothing. i was dining alone so I take all my stuff with me. im just going to the bathroom. NO LIE!! at this point i COULD have just walked out of the restaurant without paying. the host and a female were saying good bye to me. and i was like oh im just going to the bathroom.. damn my moral compass. i should have just walked out. .i was completely fed up at this point so when i leave the bathroom i literally stand next to my table like YOO!!! im ready to go where is the check and who shows up?? oh not my waiter of course not his sorry excuse of a waiter but the wonderful busboy/water refill person. and says do you want me to take care of that for you? i say please!!!! i guess protocol dictates waiters have to do it. bc next i see sorry waiter ringing up the bill. he brings the check back and says thanks and scurrys off ..\n\ni wanted to leave a tip with the other guy personally so bad as i trust no one at this restaurant at this point but he had disappeared. i left the waiter no tip.. sorry this is why i cant subscribe to the oh they only make $2 a hour argument. Im suppose to pay you for poor service when thats your job....service!!! and you KNOW thats how you actually get paid and still give poor service ... ummm methinksnot..*sigh* i only went here bc the bacchanal buffet line was ridiculous i was clueless and uninformed at the time..i now know..but i dont plan to ever step foot in vegas again so im good"

The gentleman to my left suggested the Veal (Fire Roasted Veal Chop w/Horseradish - Maple Glaze & Wild Rice Tamale + Sage Butter). Being that he was a meat distributer, we took him on his word. We also ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin w/ Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce & Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter and for an appetizer, the Blue Corn Pancake w/ Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The Blue Corn Pancake w/ BBQd Duck came out first. It was yummy and quite different from what I'm used to. I'd definitely would recommend it for anyone that wants to try BBQ Duck that's not typical Peking Duck.\n\nOur entrees came out next. The veal chop was probably a bit hyped up. The best way to describe it was that we were underwhelmed by the veal. I've had really tender roast veal at Pines of Rome (Pines of Rome on Yelp) where I didn't need to cut it with a knife; it just fell of the bone. The veal at Mesa Grill was a bit tough to cut up and eat and we could barely taste the maple in the horseradish-maple glaze. The wild rice tamale w/ sage butter was definitely tastier than the veal. Kind of disappointing being that the veal dish was $42 and we only enjoyed the tamale! The pork tenderloin was much better but not quite living up to the reviews we've read on Yelp (reviews). The spices seemed to overwhelm the pork and I struggled with rubbing off some of the ancho chile sauce which was liberally \"drizzled\" all over the pork tenderloin (it was also all over the blue corn pancake w/ duck). The saving grace of the meal was the delicious sweet potato tamale w/ pecan butter. That definitely helped balance the heavily spiced pork and it was all around yummy goodness! All in all, I definitely would give Mesa Grill another shot but wouldn't feel compelled to order the veal or the pork tenderloin again.... But definitely the sweet potato tamale!"

The smoked chile barbeque sauce with the peanuts was divine. \nThe hubby really enjoyed his pork tenderloin sandwich as well. He said it had a lot of spice and flavor to it. I can definitely say that the french fries that came with his sandwich were some of the best fries that I have ever had. They were perfectly seasoned, not too crispy and not soggy either!  \nThe only reason why this review didn't get 5 stars is because the panna cotta desert didn't really wow me.

OK I guess we will check it out.\"  \n\nAt the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for Bobby Flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  Perhaps the man can cook.  Plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nLesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nWe were there for brunch, and my date got a Mesa burger which was small but presented very nicely.  The flavor was just OK and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  Southwestern fries were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an OK complement to an OK burger.\n\nI ordered Sophie's chopped salad and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  However, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  Because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  My date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  Check minus on service.  \n\nI wouldn't be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a chopped salad and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  He may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so I was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nSide note - the bread basket had some decent items.  The blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the \"heat\" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  Stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nThe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  I had a tequila/Fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  My date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had...don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita-guy.\n\nOverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  I would say I expected more from Bobby Flay, but as I said above, he was just never really my style, so what I really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  Expectations met."

We raved so much about it that we had to come back  with my sister and her fiance so we could prove to them we were not nuts.  Sure enough the quesadilla was still delicious.  In fact all the food we ordered were fantastic and full of flavor.  My pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  The lemondrop martinis are also to die for.  The best lemondrop I have had.  I also tried the lemondrop with greentea infused vodka.  Although interesting sounding, the regular lemondrop was better.\nService was okay.  A bit scatterbrain-ish and not as well synched with the servers and the busboys seemingly on different pages.  For example, the busboy started to take my plate away when I was only half done.  I guess I must have hesitiated in my efforts to finish the huge portions.  Then it took the server a bit to bring us the dessert menu....but overall service was friendly enough."

The wait staff is very friendly, and knowledgeable, our waiter spaced out the appetizers and main entree perfectly, I hate when they bring everything at once. \n\nFor an appetizer we got the corn crusted fried oysters and the Tuna \"nachos\" both of which were insane. My girlfriend got the lamb chops and I got a steak both of which again were insane. The price was a bit steep but nothing more than we expected, it is Bobby Flay's restaurant afterall. I would love to go back for lunch to see what else he's kookin up back there.\n\nOh yeah get the house margarita one of the best I ever had. Side note I asked the waiter if Bobby Flay ever comes in and cooks for patrons?She said \"sometimes but  when he does come in he almost always cooks for the staff.\" Way to go Bobby!!!!!"

He got the burger, which he completely devoured, and I got the chicken salad with dressing on the side. It was a really pleasant surprise for them to give us not one, but THREE dressings! All dressings were delicious, and the veggies were fresh. Chicken came with the skin on, but it was very tender and flavorful. I'll definitely be back...it's a great place to eat light and feel healthy, though I'm sure you could order heavy and roll out the door if you wanted..."

This entree also comes with another side, which rotates.  When I first had it, the dinner came with roasted kernel corn with Cojita cheese and a squeeze of lime.  It all was so, soo good. \n\nAll the food is fantastic.  Great atmosphere.  It's a little expensive, and \"proper dress\" is required.  (Ex -  they made me remove my baseball cap, or I wouldn't be seated.)\n\nLetter grade:  A"

I hope that they never change the selection, I look forward to it every time I go to Vegas. \n\nBrunch is fantastic. I had the salmon quesdilla with salmon caviar and it was heaven .The most light but tasty dish ever. Lunch is just as good and extremely satisfying. I had the grouper tacos but they substituted mahi mahi. The mahi mahi melted in my mouth and the deconstructed look of the plate was perfect, understated yet easy to comprehend. The slaw for the tacos was perfectly tangy and I could eat that all day if I had to. \n\nIf you are thirsty look no further than the cactus pear ice tea. It comes as a glass of ice tea and an accompianment of simple syrup infused with pear. I wish I could take a bath in it. \n\nThe service and I am a stickler for service is some of the best in Vegas. The waiters are attentive yet not on top of you and the bus staff is perfect, knowing when to clear dishes and how to present dishes in a formal yet understated way.\n\nIf you are a vegetarian they will accomodate you, do not worry.\n\nOh and did I mention the price?? So moderate for such a heavenly experience. You are a fool if you do not like this place.\n\nI love Mesa Grill and would consider eating every meal there if I could.  Bobby Flay rocks!"

            "review": "One of my favorite chefs is Bobby Flay.  While he may be a bit overexposed with the multitude of TV shows he appears on, the guy knows how to cook and does Southwest cuisine like a frickin' culinary Einstein.  Best yet, his cookbooks have recipes that are exceedingly accessible for the home cook and if followed with reasonable precision, you end up with damn tasty results.  Therefore, it was a no-brainer for the GF and me to go for lunch at the Vegas version of his Mesa Grill.  \n\nIt was a Friday at the beginning of lunchtime.  Mesa Grill was empty and we could've sat at any table we wanted, but we decided to sit at the bar.  The bar is dominated by a heady array of fine tequilas and whisky.  Given it was before noon, we elected to just have water and some coffee.  Arturo, our bartender/server was friendly and spot on with his service.  We opened with an order of Rough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" served with mango, habanero hot sauce and avocado crema.  The \"nachos\" were exactly as advertised, a Southwest-style ceviche with a great balance of sweet and spicy hot with an avocado creaminess.  For my lunch course, I had the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno stuffed with eggplant, manchego cheese, red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar.  The Chile Relleno was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside, tender chile with gooey cheesiness on the inside, and surprisingly light all-around.  It was perfect!  The GF had the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.  I liked my dish better.  \n\nMesa Grill is an unpretentious place.  It does simple, very pleasing food.  While it may not be the finest restaurant in Las Vegas, I can't name that many that provide a more enjoyable dining experience...especially for lunch!"

(or at least menu making talent)\n\nWe ate here twice, both times during lunch and both times very different. \nThe first time we ate here a long while back, it was a Monday right at opening so there were only a few tables of people. And we had, by far, the BEST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant in my life. \nThis last time it was a Friday around 1pm and every table in the place was full, everyone and their brother wanted to be there. And our service was still very good although impossible for them to be as attentive. I think the key is that there is a waiter and an assistant, so someone is always filling your glass and available for anything you could possibly need. \n\nEverything we have eaten here has been awesome and I recommend any of them. Blue corn pancake w/ duck and habanero, goat cheese queso fundido, spicy chicken and sweet potato hash, steak sandwich, pressed Cuban burger. \n\nThe seating is comfortable and accessible. The decor is really lovely in Southwest colors. \n\nLunch time is really casual and easy to get a table. Even if its busy, you are seated quickly. No need for reservations. \nAlthough if you do wish to call ahead, please note that you will be talking to Caesars and not the restaurant itself - and Caesars requires a credit card to hold any reservations. \n\nWe like coming here so much, we have decided it is our LV ritual now. And I look forward to venturing to the NE region to try some other Bobby Flay establishments in the future."

I decided to have my birthday dinner her with knowing that this was as close to Bobby Flay as I would get.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice because you can see the kitchen in action and the overall place is huge!\n\nThe staff here is a bit on the snobby side I have to admit.  I slipped twice across the restaurant floor and no one even stopped to see if I was ok.  Talk about a law suit waiting to happen.\n\nThe food here was ok.  My mouth always salivates when I watch Iron Chef or any one of his hundreds of shows.  I even saw Mesa's grand opening on the Food Network.  Unfortunately, this place just didn't meet my expectations and doubt that I will ever go back only because the food did not have me wanting to crawl (off the floor) for more.  We ordered a three course meal and could not recommend any of the dishes that I ordered since they weren't that memorable.  The taco appetizer was good, but not OMG good.  \n\nTIP: Don't believe the hype.  Skip it."

Definitely stop by this place if you are in Vegas and want a moderately priced place that will produce great food.  \n\nI have eaten here for years and have to admit it never gets old. The appetizers, you have to try the queso fundido which is one of many you can enjoy.  Maybe the chorizo meatballs to complement the cheese with a nice wine pairing. \n\nDinner here is always a new dish for me the last I tried was the Mango Spiced Tuna which was pretty amazing, I need to find this recipe and impress on the next home dinning experience.  Note to self, Bobby loves spice so if you notice most of the items on the menu will have a kick.  MY ALL TIME FAVORITE drum roll please..... definitely has to be the porterhouse chops, one of the best dishes in vegas.  \n\nDeserts are probably the only area that leave you a bit sad after the great dishes you have experienced before a night out.  Definitely leaves you wondering why Bobby why?"

I was looking at the prixe fixe menu, at the buffalo burger in particular, and the waiter, a super cool dude who has family in Duxbury (or DELUX-bury, as I like to call it) and knew all kinds of hockey trivia - I will always remember that Gretzky started out with the Indianapolis Racers, I promise - suggested the Mesa Burger as being the better of the two, and it wasn't like he was steering me towards a more expensive selection.  \n\nThe Margaritas, though pricey, were damn good - not shy on the booze, and after two I was really starting to feel that drink."

Came for brunch and ordered the quesadilla appetizer to start with a Bloody Mary. Quesadilla was good, but not worth $16. Not hard to make something with bacon taste good. Bloody Mary was good too, but once again again not worth $10. For the main course I had the chiliquiles . . . He needs to review what a chiliquile is. What I got was a very dry corn tortillas, dense scrambled egg on top and some sauces drizzled over . . . Was more of a poorly constructed tostada if anything. Also, the grits were appalling, way over seasoned. The best thing about my visit here was the waiter. Polite, personable and attentive. Will not be coming back to this extremely over priced establishment."
