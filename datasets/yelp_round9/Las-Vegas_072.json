I like to go to bar, have a drink and talk to the people I am with, not going to happen at Downtown Cocktail Room.  My drink was good, but I only had one and left.  I have worked downtown for over 6 years, you used to be able to go to bars and have a happy hour or meet friends and talk, now they blast music like nightclubs.  If you own a bar, be a bar, turn that shit down and I will stay and spend more money on your alcohol."

At happy hour, they're only $7, so come in and try a whole bunch. The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. They'll take the time to explain the drinks and the unusual ingredients. (byrhh???

Everything about this place is perfect: the down-tempo music, the vibe, the chill crowd, the drink menu and the dim candle lighting.\n\nIt reminds me of something that would be in New York or San Francisco...very hip and chic.  I discovered my new favorite drink, the Mohave Mist, which was: Chandon, Pomegranate liquor, and Cassis...perfection! Love this place, you gotta check it out!"

            "review": "I love this hidden gem! Not many downtown goers seem to know about this place, which makes it a special experience. It's located on the corner right behind Inspire. From the outside, it almost looks like it doesn't exist because nobody walks around that area. The door is easy to miss because it's blended with the rest of the building. With that said, the hidden vibe makes this a very unique bar.\n\nThe inside is amazing. It's dark and has a different atmosphere than most bars in downtown. It's not as loud and you can actually have a decent conversation with your peers. They have quite unique but delicious cocktails and also serve absinthe if that's your cup of tea. While most bars are crowded with no place to sit, this cocktail room has plenty of seats so you will most likely find one even on a busy Saturday night out. This is definitely a good in-between bar compared to a traditional speakeasy bar and a typical, loud bar in downtown Vegas. I can't wait to share this place with my friends who haven't heard of this place!"

DCR just might be one of those places.\nIf you squint your yes- you might feel like you are in the lower east side, the mission, london, or Buenos Aries. The deliciously ridiclous cocktails (please do try the Downtown Dill, or the Sazarac) will reinforce your good decision to leave the tourist areas of Vegas and before you know it, you have arrived at one of Las Vegas's best unkept secrets\nModestly positioned on Las Vegas Blvd. the Cocktail room will be all things you have wanted in a bar. Knowledgable and creative bartendars, and a cocktail staff that will readily fulfill your imbibing pleasures.\nOn the contrary- if having a beer and a chat with friends after work is more your speed, there is no shortage of nooks to do so, and interesting people who sit at the bar to chat with.\nThe music is always low key and sexy, the DJ's on the weekends make it fun without playing all that nonsense on the strip. \nWithout going overboard, this bar is for locals and tourists who want something real and special on their trip to Vegas, which unfortunately a trip to Vegas can turn very un-special quite quickly.\nThank you DCR for always being there, no matter what the day, to offer yummy drinks, and always a cool atmosphere."

            "review": "Easily my favorite place for cocktails in Las Vegas.  There really is no better place in town that has the combination of an amazing cocktail menu, music, and atmosphere.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable with regards to the drink menu, and the service is always top notch.  You will not find a cocktail menu in town with more creativity and selection. The drinks are made by the most talented bartenders that the city has to offer, and are a great value for what you actually get - all fresh ingredients and top quality liquor.  I would highly recommend checking out \"Mixology Monday\" if you haven't been yet: the drink quality-to-value ratio for that event is hands down is the best you will find anywhere.  I have been going to DCR for a couple of years now, and the quality of the menu and staff has always been excellent and consistent.  It is great for groups as well, and everyone that I have taken there has always had a good time, and has returned often.  In terms of overall quality and enjoyment, DCR easily stands up to other cocktail lounges that you would find in NYC, LA, MIA, and other major cities.  In my opinion, it's even more enjoyable because of its humble and non-pretentious atmosphere.  It's clear that the ultimate goal is to create a unique environment and make sure that guests have the best time possible.  This is definitely accomplished here.  The lack of gimmicks and lowest-common-denominator advertising is absent, which is hugely refreshing - especially in this city.  It definitely sets the standard for Las Vegas and is a must-see for anyone who hasn't been there yet."

First time customer but would definitely revisit for another cocktail fix when in Vegas again.\n\nNot of the league of MH in nyc or Noble Experiment in San Diego but an \"A\" for honest effort. That is the only reason for only four stars. (Please note that  I rarely give five stars on a first time visit.) The decor is swanky intimate... great to take a date or to converse with close friends. Slightly off the beaten path which is common for this class of bar.\n\nTo increase stardom this bar would need to extend it's bartenders knowledge of classic couture drinks. At an establishment such as this, with all proper ingredients on hand, I expect to be able to order off menu from any of the cocktail categories. Although the bartender was not familiar with the cousins of the rikki, old fashioned and fizzes, he made an honest effort to please. Those who are new to couture cocktails will still be pleased with this establishment.\n\nWill return."

            "review": "I saw good reviews online about this place, so the hubby and I thought we would check it out for happy hour.  I went to their website first....it says drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers from 4-8pm.  There is even a food menu available to view.  We went with the expectation of eating apps along with having a couple drinks....We were wrong! \n\nSo we arrive at the bar and could not find any food on their drink menu.  My hubby asked the bartender if they had food.  She said \"you mean like a kitchen?\" We said \"yes, like appetizers\"  She proceeded to tell us that they only have munchies like pretzels, almonds, cashews, ect.. and apologized if we saw food on their website.  She said they used to have food, but don't anymore and their website is not updated. How can a business not keep their website updated??...sounds like bad management to me.\n\nAnyways, since we were already there I ordered one of their original cocktails. I don't remember the name, but it had an orange slice in it.  The drink was so freaking strong I could barely drink it.  I could literally feel the alcohol burning in my empty stomach.  I then decided to order some of their munchies to fill my stomach.  I ordered the cinnamon almonds and the pretzels, which were pretty good, but I was expecting some kind of free munchies.  Usually bars have some free peanuts or something to nibble on, but not this place.\n\nWell hubby had to help me finish the drink.  His beer was pretty good, nice and cold.  We only stayed there for one drink and left.  We both decided we won't go back.\n\nBy the way, the decor is nice, but they need to put in some kind of flooring.  The floor looks like the tile was ripped out and they never got around to finishing the floor.  It's just cement with old marks of what used to be a floor.  This doesn't match the nice decor."

There's no hidden door, but for some reason our party and other parties that followed seemed to have a difficult time figuring out how to open the door.  Thankfully, the bouncer witnessed all of our difficulties and opened the door -- guess that beats throwing people out.\n\nDCR is in downtown Vegas, so there are plenty of people around, but it's definitely not the type of place one finds on the strip.  This was a cool place to grab a few cocktails before making our way around town, and this was my favorite bar of our trip.  Definitely a hipster vibe.  There's no crazy uptight scene, but the people watching was great, service was fast and friendly, and the drinks were fantastic.  Best of all, they weren't ridiculously overpriced like some clubs on the strip.\n\nDefinitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas."

I wanted to try it out myself. \nLoved the layout and the whole feel to the place. Music was loud, dim lights, bathrooms were clean.\nI'm going to try to keep this short because i could go into every little detail. I got an extra extra dirty martini. My friend got some watermelon cucumber martini. There were 4 of us.  Before I could tell him, I want ketel one Robert walked away. My girlfriends did not like his attitude with us so decided not to order. he was really impatient and giving us attitude when we were looking over the menu.  I'm so oblivious to people sometimes lol but hey I just wanted to have a good night. \n They were busy, but nothing crazy. My friends wanted to go to another place, so I walked up to him on the other side of the bar and yelled Sir  I'm sorry I was just wondering if our drinks were started. Robert then seemed really annoyed and said yes. Then rolled his eyes. I was definitely taken back and found it extremely rude. Of course we took the drinks, but i didn't see anything wrong with canceling them if he hadn't started making them. I honestly don't know if it was because the way we were dressed or how we spoke to him. I felt like he looked down on us. Maybe he didn't think we would tip or spend a lot of money. I have no clue. He was really nice to other people sitting at the bar, but treated us differently.  anyways Watermelon cucumber was pretty good, but mine was Not extra extra dirty. It was actually pretty gross, but I was already upset with the service. I just wanted to leave. I took a few sips and left. I ended up tipping but honestly i wish I wouldn't have. I serve and I hate leaving a bad tip even if  the service was shitty.  But he did it for me. There are better cocktails at Martini bar oh and you won't be treated like shit either."

Not to mention, super close to some amazingly divey yet kick ass lucky (at least for me) casinos on fremont street. Make sure to try the rhubarb refresher when you are there. Yes...a whiskey and rhubarb drink. Seriously...could life-iness be any better??\n\nBeware of the mirrored bathrooms there if you are tanked (like I was). Some of those urinals are actually reflections of urinals in mirrors. The pee does not flush when you are done (thankfully, I noticed this juuuust before I started going, but after I bumped my head on the wall).\n\nAlso beware of the exit door if you are tanked (like I was). The door part is the *solid* side, not the glass side. Anyone remember the movie birdie? Yeah I pretty much did the same thing - full sprint into a glass wall.

This is a great starter for the evening and an even better after bar. Great place to go with friends and even chill enough to take a date here. If you're looking to hook up or you specialize in \"What Happens In Vegas, Stays In Vegas\", then this may not be it.  Most people here are here to kick back and relax.  My suggestion is to meet someone at the other lounges, bars, and cocktail rooms.  Then take them here after.  \n\nYou receive a drink menu with the prices and proofs.  This place specializes in Absinthe.  Yes, the strong stuff that I avoid so I can make it home safe. \n\nThe staff is pretty good.  Usually when you walk in, they will help seat you if you do not know where to go or can't settle on a spot. There's also enough watresses roaming that you are kept filled.  \n\nTIP: For your drinks, ask for a little or no ice.  Drinks are not watered down, but way too much ice at times.  I like the drinks cold, but hate it when it's just a sip and you're done."

And that is simply because of the entrance door. It is hilarious to sit inside and look out and watch people fumble around trying to find the entrance.\n\n2. The bartenders are actually very knowledgeable about the drinks.\n\n3. The menu rotates seasonally - and each season I find a new favorite cocktail. And more often than not, it is something I never would have normally thought of or tried.\n\n4. The layout of the menu is awesome. It gives you the name of the concoction, the type of glass it is served in, and a brief flavor profile. It does not tell you what is actually in the drink. Major appreciation points for this.\n\n5. The tourists have yet to really discover this place. In fact, I don't think I've ever encountered a tourist in here ever.\n\n6. It's a great after-work hangout. Few patrons, no loud music, and it's pretty much all locals that work in the downtown area.\n\n7. On weekend nights, it can get pretty busy and there is a DJ.\n\n8. Skip the \"food\" menu. It's all awful - I don't know why they even bothered adding these \"food\" options to their menu. However, the various nuts ARE quite good and I highly recommend them.\n\n9. You've got to go to the bathroom here. It completely freaked me out the first time. The stalls are glass. And you can see out, but others can't see in.\n\n10. Did I mention the cocktails? Seriously amazing cocktails. It WILL be the best cocktail you've ever had."

Upon entering, I found the place quite lovely. It has a sort of upscale yet cozy vibe, seemingly the kind of place for socialites in their late 20's and up. It's also quiet in the earlier hours, which is nice for a date.\n\nOne hiccup in my experience is that I found it a bit difficult to find a place I could sit alone--most of the tables had four chairs around them and the bar was already full. I felt bad taking up a table all by myself, potentially putting a whole three other people out of a seat.\n\nThat's when the host at the door let me know there was a brand new bar area in back, through the second curtain on the right. I love new places AND I love being alone so I was ecstatic to find the cute little bar was empty. I think I was officially the first person to order a drink as that night was their soft-opening.\n\nService was great, both bartenders seemed cool and upbeat but friendly. I noticed one man siting off on the far right side of the bar whom I later discovered to be the owner of DCR. I get the reason for not interacting with patrons but after finding out someone is the owner, you get a kind of weird vibe when they're not smiling, upbeat or friendly, y'know? I would have loved to compliment him on the venue if he seemed more approachable. It's one of my new favorite lounges in vegas.\n\nThe bar itself aside, the interesting part of my experience happened when an entire posse of people came in looking like they came straight out of the movie Zoolander. I don't mean to disrespect them, but that's the best way I could describe the clothing and hairstyles. I don't know if they were models, artists, singers, actors or YouTube stars... but it was quite interesting to be in the mix of it. Someone was filming a few of the people in the group.\n\nIf DCR is as popular as it is to have a crowd there filming something, who knows who else will stop by? Check it out and maybe you'll be lucky to meet some artists/celebrities~"

Upon entering, you notice that the place is very dimly lit and smells of sweet incense. There are couches and soft plush chairs with small, round tables. It's an intimate setting.  The music was low, so you could actually hear and be heard by whoever you're there with.  \n\nWe were there around 11, and the place was pretty quiet, which I like.  There were people scattered at tables, but it was easy to find a seat. They have a good selection of mix drinks, but I just had a malbec. Their wine selection is very limited. The person I went with doesn't drink, so he had a virgin Bloody Mary.  He says that it's good...I'll just take his word for it.\n\nJust like the general area, the bathroom is also very dimly lit. In fact, it borders on being too dark.  The decor consists of walls of mirrors, including the stalls. I had a difficult time at first finding the stalls. And then there was the issue of it being very dark in there.  I tried to look for a light switch, but alas, there was none.  It was awkward, but guess you have to make do with what you're given.\n\nOverall, I really like this bar.  I like the feel of it. The lighting works out well and it's got a very chill ambiance. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."

Our group kept growing in size to close to 30 which I know can be a huge nuance as a server. But our server was more than accommodating. She was always sweet and polite and kept asking anyone if they needed anything. We order 3 large punch bowls. Two of the pink ones and one of the red ones. The red one tastes like cough syrup but it's got quite the array of liquors in it. I definitely prefer the pink punch bowl although it is quite sweet. Overall thanks for the wonderful experience!

You can barely see thru the glass that there are people watching and being amused by you trying to find out how to get in. Luckily after some time of trying someone gave us a hint. \n\nOnce inside it was a quiet dark vibe. Very relaxing and definitely not touristy. It was a chill place with plenty of seating arrangements and a DJ playing music at a very reasonable sound level. I really dug the vibe they were going for. \n\nOrdering a drink was easy; the bartenders were very attentive and didn't play favorites like I've experienced other places. The drinks were VERY good. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh, nothing from a mix. \n\nOverall:\nFun way to get in kind makes this place seem mysterious, ambiance was good, staff was attentive and the drinks were excellent.

So we couldn't find how to get in, you walk up, and there's windows everywhere, and a door, that didn't look like a door, so we were going to go down the alley, around back.....ummm that didn't look like a good idea.  So we were going to walk along LV Blvd, to the back, then we heard a voice.  OK, we go back, looked around and didn't see anyone.  So we started walking away.  Then the guys that worked there was just goofing around.  It's was funny, but just know, there isn't a handle on the door, so just push it open.  \n\nSo back to the bar!  Ohhhh, we liked it, they had these L 'ish shaped couches all over the place, it was black and red.   So I had to go to the ladies room.  I go in there, open the stall ready to do my thing WAIT it's dark in here, where's the light?  Why would they put a light in a stall that you have to turn on.  Well I couldn't find it.  So I go and ask for help.  The girl told me, there's no light, because the glass is a double glass.  You can see out, but they can't see you doing your business.   Um mm, the toilet is black and it's dark in the stall.  You don't know if someone missed the toilet (if you know what I mean) Yea, so during the night, it was a issue with alot of the women about going in the stalls, it was actually funny.  Some women would straight out say, don't sit on the toilet, I might have missed!!  lol\n\nOther than the bathroom we really liked this spot.  It's not a place for the penny pincher.

They come around plenty to take away your empty jars.  \n\nYes, i do agree with most folks who have written a review.  Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos) was sitting next to us.  Can't miss the guy since he wears a black T-shirt that says \"Zappos.\"  Music is pretty loud, wish the dj would turn it down a bit so we could chat.  No dancefloor, remember.. lounge, not club.  \n\nOverrall, nice place.  Cheap. Convience. I'd come back for the jar drink."

The decor is kind of cool but for the money they charge for the drinks you can hang out on the strip at a better place.  Also, they no longer serve appetizers which I was looking forward to.  If you must come here, make it during happy hour becuase these drinks aren't worth the full price.  Overall, an ok average place but probably upscale for downtown."

This place has become the unofficial place for our CEO.  They actually named a shot after him.  Here's what I thought:\n\nDRINKS:  I usually get an ordinary vodka, soda water and a lime.  I'm not to big on \"foofy\" drinks.  Simple is always better for me.  They do make their drinks strong and I think it's valid because the drinks are a little pricier than normal.  If you're into Absinthe or Fernet, you will like their mixed drinks.  I think highly of the place because of the way they make their drinks.  Their mixologists have really taken the time to perfect the right cocktail.  Their bartenders take the time to handcraft these drinks in a seemless manner, down to the way they shake their martinis...very chic.  \n\nThe shot that we have (named after my CEO) is called the \"Delivering Happiness\" shot.  This shot  contains Fernet, an herbal liquer.  Fernet is known as a digestive spirit, very aromatic and slightly bitter.  This shot also has whiskey and lime juice.  It's an aquired taste, true.  But trust me, the Fernet really helps stablize your stomach LOL.\n\nAMBIANCE:  This place is super trendy, very chic and the low lighting offers a very intimate setting.  The decor is a bohemian theme with lots of wall art, a middle table seating and back VIP area.  The one thing this place is known for as being unique are the doors.  First, when you get in, be careful.  The glass is not the front door, it's the big metal wall to the left.  The bathroom has a one sided glass-mirror doors and walls.  When you're inside the stalls, you are able to look out as the walls are glass and see-through, however when you're looking towards the stall, it's a big mirrored wall.  The door leading to the DJ booth is a hidden door and looks like the entire wall.  Lastly, the door from the bartender's station to the backroom looks like it was made for little people.  It's half the height of a regular door.\n\nAll in all, this place has a speakeasy vibe that anyone would enjoy.  Great place to visit after a long day at work.  The ambiance allows you to properly wind down.  Lot's of executives frequent this place.  On the weekend, come early if you want proper seating."

One day while we were walking from the Big Red Garage, we saw \"downtown\" in neon on the west wall of the same building that The Beauty Bar is located in. \n\nWe finally checked it out and were blown away. Granted the first time we went, there was like, only one other party in there. But we could smell the massive potential. \n\nIt was like a true speakeasy. The music was mellow, they had earnest barmaids, and the decor was trendy but warm. \n\nThe bathrooms are cool. The stalls are partitioned with two-way mirrors. Perfect for people that have I-want-to-watch-people-while-I-pee fetishes. Walking in, seeing all of the moving mirrors, I felt like Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon. \n\nThe lounge is partitioned into two parts. The front has several tables and comfy bench seats. The back has small tables and private booths, just large enough to comfortably fit four people. I think sometimes they close up the back like a VIP area. \n\nThere is a sealed-up DJ booth and sometimes there's live bongos. \n\nThis place is hit or miss, though. Its different everytime I go.\n\nThe second time I went, it had picked up a little and there was just the right mix of people. It wasn't too crowded, there was no That Girl, and not too much pretentiousness (my biggest pet peeve). \n\nThen the third time I went, it was jam packed full of totally obnoxious, borderline frat boys. \n\nI haven't been back in a long time. I'll go back on a Wednesday or something. \n\nOh, and I had a problem finding the door, too. \n\nPark in the garage east of Fitzgerald's and just pay the fee (prolly $6 for the night). \n\nUpdate *11 June 08* \n\nWe went again this last First Friday and as I suspected it has mellowed out so much since our last visit. Plus we went a little early, like 10p. By the time the rest of our party rolled in an hour later, it had packed in. When we got there, the back section was curtained off. When our friend joined us, it had opened up and we got a table large enough to accommodate us plus one in the back. \n\nThey are now one of the few establishments in Vegas that legally serves the famous Absinthe, brand: Kubler. If you order it Van Gogh style, its chilled and served with a sugar cube. \n\nI like the versatility of Downtown. You can go there to wind up for the Beauty Bar or decompress from the chaos of the strip or downtown. \n\n$8 drinks. I recommend the pre-drink. I never leave home without a flask. \n\nWe always park in the big red garage on Carson and fourth and pay the $6 (depending on how long you stay) fee. \n\n* off the strip (kind of), non-casino"

The drinks are imaginative and delicious. The only downfall are the prices. The cocktails are generally between $9 and $12 and shots (well, lemon drop shots at least) are $10 a pop. The cocktail list is pretty extensive with some very unique concoctions. My favorite is probably Water of Life - it is basically rum and coconut water with some herbs mixed in. Might as well get some electrolytes while imbibing. The decor is dark and an interesting mix of gothic and contemporary. I love to sit near the window and watch people feel their way around to find the door. The bathrooms are also a trip. They are all mirrors and can prove very confusing once one has imbibed a sufficient amount of alcohol. The stalls are one way mirror and are actually really cool. If you come early enough, you will find comfortable seating and great service."

            "review": "I think entry into the Downtown Cocktail Room is designed as something of an IQ test set to weed out only the intelligent (and lucky) customers.  It took me a minute or two to figure out which part of the dark wall is the actual door.  While I am sure this is a continual amusement for regulars of the lounge, a small sign, a doorman, or even a handle would shave time off of the deductive reasoning.  In retrospect, it IS kind of funny.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this place.  The place looks excellent, the bartenders and servers are dressed stylish, the art on the wall is excellent, as is the (non-deafening, non-screaming over) music, and the place has a very cool \"vibe\" to it.  The vibe of any place is an intangible thing, and somewhat hard to explain.  It either feels right, or it doesn't.  This place is excellent to sit back and enjoy.  And very clean.  Someone knew what they were doing when they set up the overall look of this place.\n\nThe drinks?  I had a very nice server.  Being a first-timer, she pointed out a few excellent drink choices, both were very satisfactory, unique, and flavorful.  They even serve absinthe there, which got an eyebrow raise of surprise from me.  During the night, she forgot part of my order, but was very apologetic, and worked hard to set it right, which I couldn't help but recognize the sincerity, and the EXCELLENT customer service.  She was class.  The whole night was just a wonderful experience in which I would return again... in a particular time period.\n\nSo why 4 stars?  Another review noted it gets busy at the place around 11, which was an accurate forecast.  The issue I had with the place isn't a direct fault of the actual establishment itself or its staff, but I have to make note of it.  As it got busy, the building hipster crowd that began to appear in droves as the night wore on didn't so much as chain smoke as they began to chew and eat cigarettes in an attempt to go through what was apparently a pack smoking contest to see how many could be lit and inhaled during one night.  I can handle smallish amounts of smoke, and crowds don't bother me, but my God, man.  I was there for two previous hours of awesome, then... yeah....\n\nThey serve bar treats here.  A nice variety of bar related nibbles (served very well, and very cheap), and I guess it's debatable if that could actually be considered \"food\", but I wish it was, as food in an establishment keeps the smoking element out.  Perhaps a separate lounge, or larger fans, or an outside area, or something.  All I know is that I was having a wonderful time, but I got so smogged out that I just had to leave.  I was disappointed because I REALLY wanted to stay longer and try yet another drink, but around 11-12, it was just too much.  One of my friends and I had to leave as we started feeling sick.  Again, I don't blame the Cocktail Room itself at all, but I do hope that they can try to find an a little help for us non-smoking types.\n\nI can easily 5-star this place (and it pains me not to), but I think that will mean me both coming and leaving early here if last night was an indication of a regular weekend night.  They nailed the atmosphere, service, and drinks.  I just wish I could breathe in there as the night wears on.\n\nCool place, though."

Low candlelight and atmospheric art work glow in the background, and a nice house mix is playing through the speakers.  Plenty of space to sit at tables, or couches, with any amount of privacy you could want for you and your date or friends.\n\nThe drink menu changes with each season.  I tend to prefer the winter menus, with more whiskeys and warm concoctions.  I wasn't a big fan of the summer menu (too much cucumber).  But no matter the season, you're bound to find something on the menu that fits you.  Each drink is highly priced, but they're all made with care and the finest ingredients so they're well worth it.  I highly recommend the absinthe, served traditionally with cold water dripped over a sugar cube.  They have plenty of brands to chose from, and each is a taste of delight.\n\nIf you're in a large group, consider ordering one of the old fashioned punch bowls.  It's basically a giant cocktail that everyone can share, with individual glasses and a ladle for all.  It's a conversation piece for sure, and for the price its well worth the amount served.  As with all other cocktails on the menu, the particular punches change with the seasons.  Just stop in to see which is on the menu and ask your server.\n\nThis is a wonderful place to go for socializing downtown in a high class atmosphere, where you're bound to avoid the screaming drunks of west Fremont.  Also, there is a door guard who is very friendly, and ensures that your evening is a safe and enjoyable one."

The entry way is filled with small tables and leather chairs with a live DJ to your right . The back wall is tinted paneled glass obscured by sheers. The bar is towards the back with the female bartenders wearing red cocktail dresses and the men wearing button downs and vests, a la old school Hollywood. The drink list changes seasonally, and the bartenders are more mixologists than pretty faces (well they're actually both). I ordered a martini with freshly shaved ginger, a hint of wasabi, freshly muddled strawberries and vodka. It was one of the most unique, yet fantastic cocktails I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The bartender was friendly and the crowd was young and mixed. The live house music was fantastic, was at an appropriate volume, and everyone seemed to mingle.

But he was preoccupied with a group of older gentlemen in suits who seemed to think that they knew how to make drinks better than him.  He'd give them whatever they ordered, they'd taste it (or just look at it) and then tell him to add more of X (usually alcohol).  The bartender seemed kind of spacy because he kept trying to add tequila when they asked for vodka.  He didn't seem to know what he was doing.  Very slow making the drinks and would stare at the labels on the bottles for a good 30 seconds before pouring the liquor.  It was seriously weird.  After getting pissed for being ignored, I sat in the lounge area and waited for a cocktail waitress who showed up eventually after my friends showed.  \n\nI got the Devil's Whiskers, Last Word, and a French 75... all gin cocktails.  I love gin.  They were all reasonably good, especially at $7 happy hour prices.  But nothing extraordinary compared to high-end cocktail bars in SF and NY.  Plus, the cocktail waitress seemed spacy as well, quoting me the full price, not the happy hour price, but then charging me the happy hour price.  Also, when I was almost done with my first drink and tried to order another one, she exclaimed, \"What? You didn't like it?\"  Uh... no.  I'm almost done with my first drink and I know it takes forever to get another one so...\n\nMaybe I should try it later at night and re-review.  Overall disappointed."

            "review": "An invitation from a couple of friends presented the opportunity to experience the DCR first-hand after reading many great reviews. I want to share my experience because it seems significantly different than most of the other reviews I've read...\n\nA DCR bartender came to our table and asked us what we would like to drink. A woman in my group was interested in a certain 'Japanese' cocktail on the menu which contained ginger and wasabi ingredients, and the bartender asked her, \"What interests you about THAT drink, the strawberries?\" She mouthed the words, \"Uh, no...\" And she said it was actually the description of the drink as being a \"Filler\" drink - one with \"food qualities\" according to right-hand-side 'drink guide' on the DCR cocktail menu. The bartender said, \"I don't like the menu\" and basically told us he didn't know or care about the 'drink guide'. He seemed eager to only make drinks that were not on the menu. This was surprising, as it seemed that the DCR put a lot of effort into creating its cocktail menu and 'drink guide'.\n\nThe bartender then suggests an off-menu strawberry-based drink to the woman in my group. This is funny and ironic. Funny because I have heard her criticize bartenders for assuming that because she is a woman, she likes sweet strawberry drinks (which she doesn't) - \"8 out of 10 times when I ask a bartender to create a drink of their choice for me, it comes out sweet and strawberry. So annoying!\" Ironic because from the sleek decor of the DCR, I assumed this wouldn't be one of those times.\n\nThe bartender then asked me what kind of alcohol I would like in my drink. I suggested, \"Vodka,\" and he quickly replied, \"I don't work with vodka.\" How pretentious! What is it about this guy that he is so confident that he will get his way and only make drinks he likes to make? The 'speakeasy' vest? Over HALF of the specialty cocktails listed on the DCR cocktail menu are made with vodka! if this bartender were a waiter at a restaurant we would have walked out by now. At this point, I was ready to believe that everything Yasmin T. said in her previous review was spot-on...\n\nSo, since vodka was out of the question, I suggested, \"Bourbon.\" He suggested a \"really good Manhattan\" and the drink I ended up with was really good. He told me he used Woodford Reserve and he placed a pitted black cherry on the bottom of the martini glass. The flavor of my drink became more intense as I got to the bottom of the glass - the cherry did a good job of infusing the drink and keeping things interesting.\n\nFor being downtown, one would assume that the cocktails here cost less than those on The Strip, but apparently 'mixology' is a magic password to charge regular price, or in the case of one of the drinks on our group's DCR bill (a Sazerac), an eye-popping price: $19.00! The rest of our drinks were all between $9 and $11 each. I wonder if the old real estate adage, \"Never buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood\" applies to the DCR in some way. On the way to the bathroom I took a look around the DCR, and I was surprised to see that their 8PM Saturday night clientele basically fit two categories: Touristy guys with Oakleys on top of their heads and their Coach-bag-toting wives, and groups of 50-something single local men out with their girlfriends. DCR seems to be doing a good job fending off the hipster crowd? Where are the hipsters tonight?\n\nTo the DCR's credit, they have put considerable thought and money into the fixtures and furnishings. Overall the place was clean, the lighting was relaxing, and the QSC speakers throughout the room put out a quality sound. The music being played during our visit was a trance-electronica style which matched the decor well.\n\nOverall, I had higher expectations. Now for the hard part: 3 stars means \"A-OK\" and 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" My experience wasn't A-OK, and I've been to a lot of bars - I've traveled through 19 countries outside of North America in the past 12 months. (And no, I'm not in the military.) But in the spirit of benefit-of-the-doubt, I will give it 3 stars.\n\nAfterwards we had a pretty good Super Gyro and falafel plate around the corner at the Kabob Corner, which should be named Kabob-Around-The-Corner because it's not actually on a corner. Then, off to a dance club down the street. The night ended well, and the company was first rate!"

It's usually got dim lighting that gives it this sort of hole in the wall feel. \n\nSome of the best cocktails I've ever tried, with the most creative combinations and flavor additions like jalapenos, lavendar, ginger, and pomegranate.\n\nIt's not as pleasant when it's packed, which it sometimes is, but I still give it 4 stars.\n\nDefinitely try the absinthe served in the traditional. Can't go wrong with that, but watch yourself! It's very strong and very sneaky. \n\nIf they open the side seats and booths, grab one quickly because they fill up fast. It's definitely a nice change of pace from the madness that is Freemont. \n\nOne of the only problems is that the women's bathroom is comprised almost completely of mirrored glass, and there's no lights in the stall. We all know what happens when drunk girls use the facilities. And in the dark? Ah forget about it. Pee pee and toilet paper everywhere. \n\nEven so, this is still a diamond in the rough."

One of my friends ordered 4 drinks and her tab was actually over 300.00, the idiot bartender rang it up wrong and never told her, had we not notice it she would have spent over 260.00 more than what she should have....it makes me wonder how many times they do this and no one notices...he never even apologized. \n\nI would recommend taking a seat at one of the tables because the female staff is always right on top of their customers and always really friendly.   \n\nOne of the best parts is watching someone that has never been there try to figure out how to go in.

From the impossible-to-find front door, to the Eastern European underground \"feel\" they are aiming for, to the complicated and foreign ingredients in the cocktails offered, the DCR ruins what could be an otherwise cool place to hang out.\n\nI had the opportunity to visit DCR during a happy hour gathering for a friend's birthday and the experience left much to be desired. First, they were painfully understaffed. In fact, there was only one employee working and she was being the bartender, waitress and table busser...not a good spot to be in when there are 25 waiting to get drinks.\n\nSecond, and most importantly for me, there was no appeal to their happy hour or their drink menu. Now, I would be ok with the fact their 'happy hour' only discounts a couple of dollars from their $12 drinks (average price) but what I am not ok with is that out of the 3 drinks I purchased none were drinkable. When ordering a cocktail please beware of the many mystery jars and eyedroppers they will use to add the ingredients to your drink that will surely ruin it. If you find yourself visiting the DCR just order a glass of wine. You will thank me later."

I really hate this place on some random weekend nights, when it seems to be a completely different place. It happened to me once, and I've not been brave enough to try a weekend since. Maybe it's not that bad every time.\n\nOne of the things I miss most from Chicago are the cocktail bars (Violet Hour, Weegee's), and on some nights of the week, the Downtown fills that niche for me. On others...it's just another OONTSOONTS-DUBSTEP-OONTS filled nightclub that's so packed its impossible to move and so loud its impossible to hear the person next to you. So. Take this review with the grain of salt that particular perspective offers. \n\nI would give it 2 stars on it's \"Club-lounge\" nights, and 5 on it's \"actual cocktail room\" nights.\n\nPros:\n- I always get amazing cocktails here, and the bartenders know their stuff. Order off the menu, or tell them what you like and ask them to suggest something, either way, you can't go wrong. They are made with love, and great, fresh ingredients. \n- On \"good\" nights, it's a great place to take an old friend who just flew into town, pull up a chair, and catch up over a cocktail (or four). It's quiet enough you can talk, loud enough you aren't overheard by the world, and the staff never gives you the \"GTFO\" stinkeye.\n- These cocktails are actually worth $14. The prices are really not that bad for damn good cocktails made out of fancy pants ingredients. It's not the sort of stuff you can say, make at home, without dropping at LEAST $150 on all the necessary bottles. Unless you're ordering a gin and tonic or something, and that just sort of makes you an idiot. Be adventurous and order something with chartreuse.\n- Atmosphere is cozy and mellow. Sort of like some rich old fella's study. Curl up in a chair with a smoky scotch drink and just say \"ahhhh.\"\n\nCons:\n - Realizing you came on random nightclub night. Oontz."

She even let 2 of the drinks slide because even she knew it took a bit so that rocked. Then she brought us 3 lemon drops on the house again in a way to say sorry for the time it took... I am telling ya she really rocked it.\n\nMy girl had a \"Roasted Nuts\" it gets the name I think from of course the roasted nuts and honey around the edge of the glass, sweet and strong, very nice flavors.\n\nOur friend had a \"Wolf in Sheeps Clothing\" It was a great drink tasted a bit like coffee and was very nice...and strong. lol\n\nI had a Delirium Tremens Belgium Ale, ok so I'm going on a lil tangent here... omg this was like some kind of champagne ale or something, so sweet and bubbly, I think it's the best ale I ever had, and apparently after researching it today is one of the most highly regarded ales ever made. \"The golden color gives way to an ice-white head, with a complex aroma of citrus, banana and spice.\"\n\nOn a side note \"Delirium Tremens\" is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that involves sudden and severe mental or neurological changes. -  LMAO too funny and a great name to give a ale.\n\nI also tried an Absinthe, which I have never had so I wanted to try it as they have several brands on the menu. It was a \"Le Tourment Vert\" 100\u00ba, from Brie-Sous-Archiac, France, which I had in the \"scorched\" style of preparation. It was not my cup of tea. Now as far as Absinthe goes my girl liked it and said for an Absinthe its really smooth. I am not downing the drink, I guess I just did not like the earthiness that it has, so I'll not be ordering Absinthe again, but I had to try it at least once in my life.\n\nAll in all it was a great time there and our waitress rocked so we tipped her like $30 and we will definitely keep going back there."

Therefore, the entrance is hidden. Though, the Dj or security guard will get a laugh out of you trying to find the door and then show you where it is. Once you get in, everything is pretty dark but they have a small bar and comfy seating areas. \n\nUnlike many other bars and restaurants, they have a rotating menu. Their menu changes every season so it is always exciting to go back once a season to take a look at their new menu. On every menu, every drink that's crafted will have a number underneath it. That number represents how intricate the drink is -- kind of like the creativity level? \n\nNow, being under the category of a speakeasy bar .. it means that a  majority of the crafted drinks are gin or whiskey based. If you dislike these two types of liquors then you may not enjoy any of the drinks. However, I don't like either of those liquors and yet some of their crafted drinks are deliciously well mixed. Their drinks are also very creative -- some include a cookie, some with a cone, and some with cheese and crackers. Their drinks are not cheap compared to a lot of the bars on Fremont St. .. they run for $10 and above. \n\nWhat's even better? Their punch bowls! If your group doesn't mind getting the same drinks, just get a punch bowl. It ends up to be a better deal than getting your own drinks. \n\nAside from the crafted drinks, they have absinthe that could be prepared with three diff methods: the traditional, scorched, and the last method I forgot the name to but it makes it really sweet. They have little snacks, beers, and shots as well. \n\nIf you got friends in town or you and your friends just want a different atmosphere, give DCR a try. It's a pretty sweeeeet experience.\n\nThough, on the side note .. I really wished their bathrooms weren't so creepy."

It's a hard spot to find, and even harder to figure out how to get in the door...\n\nThe DCR (as it's referred to by locals) features an ever evolving menu of expertly hand crafted cocktails.  The mixologists here the best in Vegas and they concoct recipes that later become popular in trendy places on the strip.\n\nThis place often has DJs and a hip crowd on the weekends, however my favorite time to come here is during the week when the regulars congregate around the bar and mixologists are working on their latest creations.\n\nI would recommend a drink or two, but by the time you read this, the menu will be completely different ;)"

It's on the left hand side. \n\nDCR is composed of little tables and couches and a few booths. The music is house/techno, not my cup of tea, but it's not too annoying loud where you can't hold a conversation. The lighting is dim, but not too dark.\n\nWhat makes DCR so damn boss are the never ending rotation of seasonal cocktails. You can order your typical vodka-cran or beer, but what sets DCR apart are these complex, tasty beverages. I strongly believe that if you go to DCR and don't order a cocktail off their menu, you're not experiencing DCR!\n\nDCR is not pretentious, there's no typical patron. Vegas movers and shakers are spotted here (writers, CEOs, the mayor). The bar itself is small, but the place is classy, artsy, and vibrant, but without being \"in your face.\"\n\nDCR, you rock my socks and shoes!"

Unfortunately for me, going to the valet here helped me avoid the pitfall of walking in the front door (which I never would've found).  Sitting at the small table that immediately faces the front door, however, provided me a few hours of entertainment as I watched people feel around the glass, slam their knees into the concrete wall near the door or try in vain to pull the door open when it could just as easily have been pushed.\n\nThe libations were excellent with my companion enjoying a few mixed drinks that were masterfully created.  While only one of the two did she truly enjoy, it was still a pleasure to see a truly mixed drink created instead of simply poured.  I also had the pleasure of trying one of their new drinks: absinthe.  While the brands they now carry are not truly absinthe, the flavor and alcohol content are still there (Lucid is 126 proof).  You can have it traditionally poured or simply have a shot.  It's the same price ($15 for Lucid) either way, so have it traditionally done.  You'll never realize you've needed so many accessories to have a drink (spoon to pour water over sugar into absinthe, ice cubes and extra water to cool or tone down taste).\n\nThe atmosphere here is excellent.  It's laid back, unpretentious and cool.  The music and DJ were excellent...loud enough but not too loud to keep you from talking with your friends (or soon to be friends).  There are private rooms and areas throughout that we didn't even get to see.  In the main bar area, there is a large table that is cordoned off by a see-through mesh type of material which seemed like a great idea (kept the noise in/out, some privacy but allows others to venture in easily).  The waitresses were excellent with excellent ideas for a drink if you can't figure it out.  \n\nCheck the pictures already posted of this place, but better yet head downtown and enjoy it for yourself.  Drinks are a little pricey for my tastes, but sipping a glass of absinthe or something more to your liking with a good friend or group can keep the price down.  I'd rather spend $10 here on a good drink than $1 each for a crappy 1/10 ounce of tequila margarita at the Fremont Casino nearby."

Subtly is rarely appreciated in a town where prostitutes are advertised on giant billboard trucks driving up and down the main drag.\n\nAs there must be an exception to every rule, in a town of excess someone must arise to sneak a little quiet class into the mix.  Enter the Downtown Cocktail Room.  The LA-style bar is hidden just off Fremont with a bolted entrance door that makes the place look boarded up (it has no handle and you have to push).  The bar is dark, with most of the tables lit by candlelight.  Curtains hang from the ceiling, separating the room into intimate areas where guests sit in comfy leather chairs.\n\nBut that's all atmosphere.  Even if this place wasn't mellow and intimate, the drinks would make it worthwhile.  The Downtown Cocktail Room is all about drinks as art.  Fresh ingredients and inventive flavors abound.  Martinis with ginger or papaya; several varieties of absinthe (and a staff knowledgeable enough to explain the absinthe ceremony); a good Manhattan and an entire menu of liquor art.  \n\nThe folks I went with usually drinks straight liquor, refraining from any sweet or poofy drinks, but the menu's cocktails were so inventive we indulged.  And the bar did an excellent job ensuring that the flavoring ingredients accented the liquor, rather than drowning it out.  5 stars for the Downtown Cocktail Room, which is one of the places I take visitors to town when I want them to have an quality experience. \n\nHappy hour is M-F from 4pm - 8pm (discounts on cocktails and beers)."

After losing out on the Book of Mormon lottery at the Smith Center, we decided to go to the downtown area for Happy Hour.  It was Tuesday, so our options were limited, since a number of bars are dark Mondays and Tuesdays.  \n\nWe couldn't figure out how to get inside; DCR was dark and looked closed, but a waitress going in opened the door for us.  I learned later that it billed itself as a speakeasy, and I can understand why.\n\nInside is a comfy and attractive dark lounge that was nearly empty.  We sat at the surprisingly small bar, and the bartender, was very helpful, describing each drink on the menu.  Based on his description I ordered an Aqua Boogie and liked it.  Hubs had a beer.  \n\nWe were disappointed that they didn't have the kind of HH food menu that we're used to at other places, just a few items that they get from Uncle Joe's(?) pizza around the corner.  We had chicken fingers, which were very good, but they wouldn't have been our choice if it had been a real menu.  \n\nThe full impact - and I do mean impact - of the speakeasy vibe happened when we left:  I walked head first into the glass wall right next to the door.  I thought that glass wall was the door, but nooooo!  A waitress was very quick to bring me an ice pack for my aching forehead.  I'm writing this five days later, and still have a nasty and painful egg.  And I only had one drink!"

One very generous patron sent us a round of shots that I was told were wonderful, and everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their drinks and the snacks.

She suggested the watermelon martini, light on the simple syrup. I hate most watermelon cocktails because they are green or hot pink and remind me of jolly ranchers and they use \"pucker\", but I trusted her and she delivered! The cocktail wasn't sweet at all, and was so fresh and summery and delicious. I followed up the watermelon with a blueberry cocktail. Also tasty, but  the watermelon cocktail was the best ! \n\nShe also offered me an \"earthy\" free shot of some kind. So complex, interesting, and tasty. Oh and I polished off an entire f-ing cheeseplate by my self while there. Oops (I literally think I downed 12 ounces of cheese in one sitting - my cheese addiction is scary!).

Note: the entry is a pitch black semi creepy vestibule and the ginormous metal section on the left with no discernable handle or moving parts is the door.  \n\nThere is lots of seating but this joint was packed on our visit (10:00 on a Tuesday? - go figure).  So, we ended up trying to stay out of the way but got jossled back and forth by passers by.  \n\nThere was an excellent band playing.  They were super good, entertaining and talented.  \n\nBartender was nice, and personable.  He took his time and made our drinks with love.\n\nHubby got a gin martini.  $13.  Yikes!  Guess this place doesn't conform to downtown pricing.  \n\nI did notice they offer some cool eclectic cocktails and absinthe drinks and such.  They are following suit with the trend for legit bars and they have homemade bitters.\n\nIf you are into good live music, expensive fancy drinks, and hipsters...this is the place for you!"

Drinks are always gorgeous and tasty - not to mention incredibly unique! The atmosphere and music at DCR is perfect - laid back to where you can still have a conversation with friends,but so fun and upbeat. Everyone here is so incredibly nice and make sure to go above and beyond to make sure you're happy.\n\nA few months ago when it was time to start planning a surprise party for my boyfriend, I immediately knew this was our place. I put in a request to see what it would cost, and was thrilled to see a more than reasonable quote for a 2 hour open bar reserved in the private back area. We had the party there last Friday night, and talk about accommodating - DCR let me come in an hour before they even opened to drop off the custom cake and set up decorations... and were an absolute pleasure to deal with from start to finish (as always). Special thanks to our awesome waitress, Mona, for being there for us throughout the event. I can tell you that this place was already my boyfriend's favorite spot, and now even MORE so!\n\nWe also owe endless thanks to Kevin for making sure that we're taken care of every time we're at DCR! He's truly one of the absolute nicest people I've ever met, and we know we're in good hands anytime we see him. He has made me some of the most delicious drinks, and is always so much fun to chat with.\n\nSeriously, these guys are the absolute BEST - and we will see you again soon, DCR!"

I don't know if it gets wild later or on weekends, but at 5-8pm on a Thursday night, the crowd was small and serene (and nobody was smoking!) and the music volume was pleasantly low. So nice not having to yell at a bar.\n\nThe cocktails here are adventurous, and it's cute that the menu provides a little guide as to how complex each drink is. Going off the new summer menu, I had the My Cousin Vinnie, a nutty(!) drink using Aquavit (or, rather, home-infused \"Vodkavit\") and pistachios. It was unlike anything I'd had before, and it was delicious. Followed it up with a Mezcal-agave drink (forget the name) which was good, but was made by a new bartender, so it wasn't as good as the one my wife had earlier that evening, made by the head bartender.\n\nService is friendly and prompt, and prices are amazing (most drinks around $10, brought down to $8 during the 4pm-8pm happy hour). Very generous for such strong, top-quality cocktails."

At DCR you'll find creative seasonal cocktails and a fairly diverse crowd. While there really is no dance floor to practice your latest house dance moves, on busier nights impromptu mini-dance floors may appear as the night progresses and DCR's strong drinks begin to take effect.\n\nHead towards the right side of the bar and you'll find some semi-private, plush little booths with these dope chandeliers -- for those more cozy, intimate rendezvous ahem*wink*wink*nudge*nudge* The last time I visited it was a windly, cold and wet Thursday which I'm sure scared people off and there was no DJ. Typically Fridays and the weekends are definitely the best times to visit. Good luck finding a seat during summertime tho. And if its First Friday then fuggetaaboutit. One small knock -- service can be lax at times and its lack of light may make it hard for the waitress to see, but no excuses from me.

You start with a good meal (or adequate as the case of this night at Therapy---go for the dates and tuna tartare) and progress to a watering hole that has been good to you in the past. In my case, two previous occasions. Arriving at 8:20, only nerds and old farts are struggling with the entrance. It's the wooden door on your left, push it. Management must not put a helping hand sign because it amuses the wait staff to see potential patrons miming the glass. \n\nWe had the lounge chairs to ourselves. The back room, behind a red curtain is redolent of some Wizard of Oz shit. There's booths and more tables where one can get lost with party in tow. Right. To the real part. This bar doesn't serve food. It's speciality booze. We had the My Cousin Vinnie, the lamb leg-cured mezcal sipping shot, before the spin surprise, a free cocktail tasting of lemon-honey cough drops. Interesting and so cool the bartender wants to play with able bodied palettes. Then came a round of what we would call the Ham & Cheese BBQ drink and a Suzie something with more mezcal for me. By this time, I'm sloshed and tell our lovely waitress it's the punch at the end of a party. She looks at me with that expression of \"Oh, do you amuse yourself?\" But the party of bachelors starting their evening paid for this round because we willingly moved to other chairs so they could sit together. Very classy move. Thank god my love can metabolize like a true Italian. We made kissy faces and departed, wishing the DJ happy shuffling. \n\nIt's always a good time with red velvet drapes."

Our server was so sweet, attentive and patient with our group of too many (14).\n3.  They use fresh ingredients.  It was obvious that the fruit in the drinks was fresh.  After reading some of the drink descriptions, I was afraid that they would be too sweet.  Not so at all.\n4.  Our entire group drank for three hours for around $400 and not during happy hour.  I didn't know that was possible.  OK, some of our group were drinking beer but still.\n5.  The bathrooms are awesome.\n6.  They have punch service.\n7.  The house music was just the right volume.\n8.  The place was not too crowded on a Friday night, it was just right.\n9.  It's a really cool place to hang out.\n\nUltimately, I never wanted to go there with a group.  I wanted to go and sit at the bar and not have to deal with a bunch of people.  I love talking to bartenders, not in a creepy way but so that I can hear all about what they're working on and what they have planned for the next great drink.  The good part about going with a group, though, is that you can try lots of different cocktails.\n\nI got to try both punches, the Orthodox Caveman, Japanese Cocktail, Hemingway Daiquiri, Downtown Cider, Pumpkin Spice, Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla, Funky Pear Medina, and the Grande Absente Traditional Absinthe Service.\n\nOverall, I didn't feel like the cocktails were all that well balanced.  As I mentioned before, I noticed that the fruit was fresh in all of the cocktails.  Perhaps the tartness of the citrus impacted the drinks.  I'm not sure but they all seemed very heavy on the citrus.  The Daiquiri in particular had an overwhelming amount of lime.  Taking note of this, I asked the bartender to go easy on the lime in the Japanese Cocktail and it was perfect.\n\nThe Orthodox Caveman was interesting.  I wasn't sure how they were going to make cachaca and scotch go together but it worked.  It was a little heavy on the scotch, though.  We really liked the Sarsaparilla and I liked the fact that they offer a variety of absinthe and styles of service.  I was a little bummed that they don't bring the fountain to your table.  Another good reason to sit at the bar.\n\nI'm really glad that I found this place.  Spending over two months out of the year in Vegas for work can really suck when you're stuck on the strip.  I can't wait to come back and try some more cocktails...and hopefully check out happy hour!"

They say the menu has been finely tuned so you should order off of it, but I always enjoy ordering off the menu and giving the bartender a chance to shine.  We had two whiskey-based concoctions and two absinthe-based concoctions.  All we asked for was the base, maybe a flavor or two, and a sweetness factor.  They came back with delicious offerings each and every time.  The bartenders also were very talkative and nice even with a full crowd ordering drinks.  \n\nThis is the best cocktail bar downtown by far.  Herbs & Rye and Oak & Ivy are other solid offerings in town for a quality cocktail, but I think Downtown is my new must stop for the best drink in Vegas.

The bartenders really know how to make a good cocktail. \n\nThey have seasonal menus which feature Classic cocktails as well as DCR originals. They usually have something for every palate, from sweet to spicy to bitter to \"does this taste like campfire and graham crackers to you?\" The bartenders will even throw something together on a whim. \n\nThe ambiance and music is pretty low key and it's a great spot for a date or just a nice quiet evening out. The front door is sometimes a little hard to find and the bathrooms are a bit interesting but that all adds to the allure of the place."

They make their own cherries and various syrups, so everything is fresh and tasty. High quality ingredients makes for high quality cocktails.\n\nWe were there for 3 hours and tried just about everything on the menu. The drinks were really creative and delicious! No complaints on that front. We got there early enough that the bartender kept the happy hour prices going well past the end, so our 9 drinks + food + a generous tip came in under $100.\n\nA wonderful surprise in that city of over-priced tourist traps."

We leave the lovely 5th Street Campus in downtown Las Vegas and begin walking excitedly toward a destination where we will imbibe on alcohol-infused concoctions.  Imagine our dismay when we find the closest establishment is shut down, the 2nd establishment isn't even a bar (we all swear that small neon sign in the window looked like a beer label), and the third is closed.  As we stood there laughing at how eight very bright scholars (again, tongue in cheek) can't figure out how to find a bar, someone suggested Downtown Cocktail Room.  Yes!\n\nWe arrived and the two of us who've been there before enjoyed watching the others try to figure out how to get inside.  Our need for an alcohol-infused libation overcame our slightly evil enjoyment of watching \"Where's the door?\" and we finally went inside.  Nirvana (but with an acute awareness of the modern surroundings of dark leather chairs and espresso tables)!\n\nI figured I would enjoy the same delicious beverage I'd had before (some kind of martini with fresh sage & black pepper), but on the menu it was not to be found.  You see, although they do have some standard drinks that remain on the menu, the real gems are the creative concoctions they create using fresh, seasonal ingredients.  They are even so kind as to provide a guide as to the approachability of said drinks (I mistakenly thought the numbers represented the strength of alcohol in each drink).\n\nPow!  Bam!  This perfectly described the very pretty & very fun & very aptly named luscious libation - Onomatopoeia.  A fresh raspberry was perched atop a champagne glass filled with dark cheery, cherry goodness.  Pop the berry in your mouth and it popped right back!  It's true!  There were pop rocks on the berry!  The fresh fruit muddled in the remaining liquid love was, well, fresh.\n\nWe all enjoyed a variety of flavored cashews, tasty pretzels, and olives (two choices for $5).  The chili infused were spicy, spicy goodness!\n\nLove this place and look forward to another visit sometime soon.  Cheers!"

I know that between my husband and I, we tried four cocktails including the Pumpkin Spice, Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla and Don't Fig With Me but I cannot remember the fourth. I swear there was something with chocolate bitters but it's not in anything we ordered according to the online menu.\n\nThe Pumpkin Spice was a bit heavy on the bourbon; there was a nice pumpkin flavor underneath but the liquor overpowered it. I think I preferred the Sarsaparilla, which had a surprisingly complex flavor yet wasn't too sweet at all. I finished off with the FIg which was VERY sweet, as you would expect from figs- maybe too much for my taste, but very autumnal.\n\nService was a little slow, but friendly. I found the drinks fairly priced for what they are- complicated and strong- but none of them would be a repeat for me; if we go back, I'll try something else next time."

The staff clearly put extensive amounts of time and research into seasonally creating their menu and collaborating to put together a lineup of drinks they all stand behind and have made their own.  This kind of attention to detail and personal touch is something hard to find in Vegas, or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nKevin and Jeff have served me all of the times I've been there, and have been nothing short of outstanding.  Kevin spent an hour one night on a slow weekday talking about the history of absinthe and how it came to be.  Jeff has spent ample time discussing how they create their menu, the various forms of spirits they carry, including the local distillery they feature.  Not at all pretentious, very personable, and clearly very invested in what they do.  \n\nI've ordered many times off the menu from both of them, and the care they put in to taking the idea I give them and putting out a top quality drink is extraordinary.  Frankly, the look of concern on their face every time they hand me a drink is a show of just how much they want to get it right.  To date, they haven't missed once on creating exactly what I asked for and executing it flawlessly.\n\nI would strongly recommend coming here if you're a local, a tourist, a conventioneer, or whatever reason you have to be in Las Vegas.

A top quality Vegas nightlife spot that doesn't judge you the minute you walk in the door based on what you're wearing and who you're with - a diamond in the rough for sure.\n\nI wish I didn't like 3,000 miles away from here, or I'd be in every weekend.  I won't tell you how to open the front door, that's for you to find out.  :)"

So, we passed... as the shot of strait Absinthe was way too much to handle (maybe if it were served properly) \n\nLater the same day, we were over at another downtown bar ... which also had Absinthe (not one of the \"two\" bars in Vegas that supposedly have it.... ) \n\nAlso, before we left, we noticed it @ one of the gift stores.

Considering that it's a block away and practically the Downtown Project's office (hell, they even put a sign on the door), I figured I should rectify that.\n\nInside, it was a lot different than I imagined, walking by the completely blank fa\u00e7ade. My wife and I went with, of all people, our parents while they were in for thanksgiving. The vibe was good (indie hip-hop helps) and the bathroom stalls were AWESOME. If you'll excuse my frankness, it's really freeing to be doing your business, able to see everyone else in the room without them seeing you!\n\nBut this is a cocktail bar, and the cocktails are where they falter. I was not impressed with what I had from the fall menu. The \"Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla\" tastes like one would expect, but the Pumpkin Spice was heavy on the bourbon and skimpy on the pumpkin - pulling off such a drink is a delicate balance and in this case, the balance was out of whack.\n\nThe \"Don't Fig With Me\" was not as figgish as I expected, which is actually a good thing. There was one more drink we tried, but I can't remember what it was and the menu on the website is sorely out-of-date.\n\nI'll finish by saying that while the drinks are unbalanced, they definitely get the job done. I'll give DCR another shot when the winter menu is ready."

As promised, the venue offers a funky, dark atmosphere to imbibe some hand crafted cocktails. They had decent DJ music which everyone liked and was at a volume that allowed for conversation.  I didn't expect how dark the place was going to be. It was so dark in there we had to wait about 10 minutes for our eyes to adjust so that we could read the menu. The menu has several options, offering a rating system of for some of their cocktails. At first, I thought it was rating the potency of the cocktail, but after asking our server, she explained it rates the complexity of the drink. I had the Apple Bobbin, which I found light and refreshing.  The reason this place only gets 2 stars is because of the bathroom. The dark theme continues into the (very poorly ventilated) bathroom. It was pitch black in one of the stalls. There was absolutely NO light. I was too scared to use it so I waited until the other stall opened up. Once in the stall, you see that you are behind double sided mirror, allowing you to see everyone in the washroom while they are unable to see you. This bathroom just felt like horror movie waiting to happen. What an awkward experience. We had one drink and left, if we stayed longer we might have fallen asleep!"

We LOVED it. Loved the drinks, loved the design of the room, we even loved the hidden front door.\n\nWe travel to Las Vegas two or three times a year to see family, and this has become a staple of our visits. When we first spoke to Michael and Jennifer about having our reception there they were extremely helpful and spent a good deal of time talking about our options. On each of our trips I've been excited to try the new cocktails they've crafted for their seasonal menu, and being in the service industry in Chicago this kind of attention to detail and ingredients never disappoints. The drink menu was one of the big selling points for our reception. \n\nThe reception itself was fantastic. The staff were incredible, they treated our guests with the perfect amount of enthusiasm, drink knowledge, and just simply exceptional service. We felt like they were a part of our party, and all of our guests (friends and family) were impressed with the drinks, the service, and the space itself. We brought our own ipod with a pre-made playlist and they hooked it up for us no problem. \n\nDowntown Cocktail Room has been one of my favorite places in Vegas since my first visit, and they went above and beyond to make sure our wedding reception was flawless."

            "review": "Time for an update...\n\nWithin the past month I've visited Downtown Cocktail Room three times.  And whether it was through my personal experience or the experience of others in my party, things have left a generally sour taste in my mouth as of late.  There are a few things that have stood out in my recent visits:\n\n-The audacity of a specific bartender.  I always welcome a bartender/mixologists opinion when it comes to recommendations for spirits and cocktails, but this individual comes across as arrogant and presumptuous.  He offers suggestions for DCR-original creations, and then openly admits that all of his recommendations are his own creation.  This came up after a customer had inquired about a drink on the Spring menu, and the bartender said that he wasn't the one who created the drink.  In addition, he ignored a customers request for a cocktail made with a specific spirit, stating that he doesn't work with it; he then waited for the customer to suggest a different spirit base for a cocktail.  As a side note, this bartender also rang up my bill incorrectly during this visit, over charging me for a drink.\n\n-Service.  Waitresses were not immediately willing to seat my party in the back area of DCR.  This was brought to my attention by another member of my party, as I arrived after they had.  They were told that there was no seating available, and we only ended up in the back area because a member of our party asked about it.  Am I to believe we would have been out of luck if we weren't aware of the back area?  Maybe.  After being seated, ordering our drinks, and then receiving our drinks, the waitress asked if we wanted to start a tab.  Standard procedure, that's cool.  Some individuals were done ordering and decided it would be easier on them to pay their portion of the bill now, instead of having their total added to a tab.  The waitress then proceeded to bring out the bill for everyone at the table.  Later in the night, when another party was seated in the back area, the waitress took an empty chair from our table without asking us if it was taken.\n\n-Did you know there was a $20 minimum if you're going to use a credit card/debit card?  I sure didn't.  After going here for the better part of two years, that issue has never come up; I know this because I often don't carry cash, and also usually order only two drinks (which will keep the bill below $20).  However, on a recent visit, I ordered one drink for myself and another drink for a friend, for a total bill of $19.  First of all, the bill was brought to us right after our drinks were delivered.  Really?  You want me out of there that bad?  After handing the bill back with my debit card, the waitress stated that there was a $20 minimum and that they would have to add $1 to my bill so that I could use my card.  My card is Visa; if this establishment accepts Visa, then they also accept all fees due upon Visa transactions from customers.\n\n-Responses to Yelp reviews:  Eight out of the ten lowest scored reviews have received a response from Michael C. of Downtown Cocktail Room.  Not one comment or response, however, was given to reviews over three stars.  It's one thing to step up and address concerns with reviews that you feel are not a valid representation of your business; however these responses avoid the overall commentary of the reviews, and a number of them end with something along the lines of, \"Come by DCR and form your own opinion.\"  Normally I wouldn't nitpick and pull out a statistic like I did above, but it surprised me to hear about the feedback that people had received for their reviews (three stars or lower), while I had not gotten any feedback for my review (five stars).  It's a little disheartening to see all the attention the negative reviews receive, while the glowing reviews from regular customers appear to go unnoticed (until their rating goes down, in which case the deduction of two stars in a review prompted a response that ended with, \"Thanks for all of the past support!\")\n\nThanks for all of the past support?  Well, your welcome for all of mine as well.  We'll see how things go from here, as I'm sure I'll end up here again; probably just not twice a month as I have in the past."

It's really refreshing to have new destinations down there besides the Beauty Bar and Jillians.  I was tres excited to visit the new Downtown Cocktail Room.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.\n\nFirst of all, it's hard to find the door; and it was the first place we went all evening so everyone still had their wits about them.  The DJ had to shine a light on it from the inside, and even then it still looked like a panel of plywood covering a broken window. \n\nThe interior is wonderful.  Dark, cozy, and intimate, reds and tans and chrome intermingle with candlelight and interesting art.  However, that first glimpse was about as much excitement as the venue offered.  I can definitely see this place being excellent for a two person chit-chat-a-thon - it just wasn't suitable to our 5 person strong group who felt like whooping it up for the evening.\n\nThe weirdest thing about this place are the stalls in the ladies' restroom.  I, of course, have no idea about the men's, but the treatment on the stalls gives them a slight two-way-mirror effect (you can see right out when you're inside) HOWEVER you can see right through them from the outside if you're close enough - and close enough is just where the sinks are located.  I feel close to all my sisters, but I don't know if I want to feel THAT close."

VEGANS- beware! Some of the drinks contain eggwhites, honey, dairy, or Campari and are not necessarily listed on the menu.  When in doubt, ask the bartender.  They're usually cool about making you a vegan version.\n\n2.  Usually the first Monday of the month is \"Mixology Monday,\" which is a hot mess of a good time.  A guest mixologist makes 4 special cocktails to highlight the featured booze of the evening (I went for Veev Acai liqueur and .... some other stuff that I drank too much to remember what they were... but every time I've gone it's been excellent.)  \n\n3.  On weeknights, it's a great place to go with friends/ a date that you actually want to talk to because it's not too crowded, the music is not loud, and the ambiance is nice.\n\n4.

I was shocked at the size of the bar as well; for there was an entire room in the back with more tables and chairs. \n\nService was fantastic - prompt and accommodating. Hearing the DCR was a gin master, I ordered the Barbieri Swizzle. What made it into my cocktail, I can't be too sure (a solid sign of a great cocktail, in my opinion). Fruity yet tart, I certainly didn't taste the gin, but half an hour later, I felt it - my kind of drink. \n\nThe first bar I went to since coming home to Vegas, I am certainly aware of what I am missing out now. DCR triumphs over any bar on the Strip. Low-key with a great atmosphere, drinks and service, I would come back again!"

I must say, the vibe on a Tuesday was pretty lame, BUT I tried the sangria punch bowl and it was delicious!  Knowing that the drinks were probably going to be tasty consistently, I returned last weekend with an out of town friend, and the crowd was an entertaining mix of downtown people, great people watching and the music was much better.  The real attraction are the cocktails though, WOW they were incredible.  There are stacks of fresh herbs and fruit behind the bar and their bar tenders are extremely talented.\nAfter our group ordered a couple of drinks off the menu, our bartender started making us custom cocktails.  We'd tell him we wanted to try a play off of a mojito styled drink and he was off, mixing up some tasty concoction.  \nYes it's a little pricey, but well worth it for some incredible drinks.  I'd say if you don't mind it being empty go anytime of the week, but if you want some decent people watching stick to the weekends."

Now moving to the front door...    if you dont know that the door is there...    it has a kind of \"Speak Easy\" vibe.     Once you find the door (and realize that people inside can see you looking for the door...   Funny)    you enter a very cool and surprising ultra lounge...    DJ in the corner... cool seating options with high top tables, a cool bar and plebty of low couches that you and your group can hang at for the night.     \n\nNow drinks....    Usually this happens...   Everyone orders whatever drink...    or a bottle of somthing...    and you go on with life...      Well do yourself a favor and get the \"punch Bowl\"    4 people get the small one...   more people get the large.   Its exactly  what it sounds like...    a bowl of (very tasty but really strong) punch...    like you would find at a high school dance in the 50's...      Fun.    Drop the ladle in and have fun with it...    not only is it a fun way to get tipsy with friends but it ads to the conversation.   \n\nOk somthing that not many people would talk about or even care about...    but the restrooms...     all the stalls are full length mirrors...     you can see you but others cant see in...

It was fun to watch the bartender light a fire under a sprig of rosemary, then gently place it into the wine glass. This is the first time ever drinking any scotch-based drink from a wine glass... but I think they did it this way so you get a whiff of the smokiness from the rosemary before you take a sip. Proportion for all the ingredients were a bit off... so it tasted more like a sweet honey lemonade (kind of watered down, too); not what I wanted at all. \n\nMy friend got some kind of whiskey on the rocks per recommendation from the bartender since he didn't know what he wanted. I liked this a lot more. It had a nice kick and left a little buzz in your nose as an after note. We ended up trading drinks haha.\n\nThe environment was great: positive vibes all around. I didn't feel that it was too crowded; it was easy to find a place to sit. The music subtly added to the atmosphere and I caught myself moving along to the beat without thinking about it. \n\nOverall, I was a little disappointed since their cocktails were heavily raved... but my cocktail fell short of expectations."

With it's trapdoor entrance, hip young urban professional vibe, and experimental mixology menu, this bar would be much more comfortable in Chicago, NYC, or a number of other cities where places like these are more commonplace.  But perhaps it's the secret location on Las Vegas Blvd. south of Fremont St. that makes this the ultimate 21st Century Vegas speakeasy.  \n\nSelf-park for free at the El Cortez and walk the 2 blocks to D.C.R. and you'll pass some of the bar's equally progressive neighbors - Beauty Bar and The Griffin.  Be prepared for a triumvirate of local places replacing video poker with actual cocktails on the bar, and where being amongst the \"in crowd\" is not precluded by paying $400 for a bottle of vodka and a spot on a love seat.\n\nA collection of couches, chairs, and stools dot the various loose \"sections\" of the room, allowing you to be a part of the masses or in your own little world depending on your needs for the evening.  D.C.R. keeps the lights turned low and the groove & electro tunes turned up, often with live DJ's.  If only there were a hip restaurant in the area to pair this with, date night would be a done deal (Triple George Grill, close enough I guess,)."

I was excited about all of them because they are unique to the Downtown Cocktail Room.  They also give each drink a \"level\" which denotes its complexity (think wine complexity).  \n\nIn addition, their drinks were pretty reasonable, which surprised me.

The decor is brooding and hip.  There are, at times, dj's playing usually electro house or ambient.  I have not witnessed any pop or hiphop here so it is definitely geared toward a mature late 20's and above crowd.  You find vintage and eclectic drinks here and don't expect to get a real bargain, but you do get what you pay for.  Absinthe in many varieties, refined spirits and a plethora of garnishes.

When I asked why this was, I was told it was because they didn't want their drinks stolen.  \n\nThe humor comes from the fact that the drinks on the menu are mostly fairly well known (such as The Last Word).  \n\nI have an idea, how about you create new drinks and continue to innovate rather than come up with a few cocktails and keep them secret so you can ride the menu for the next two years?  \n\nA true master is not measured on how many students he has, but by how many masters he has created.

A great deal and it comes with the cutest little punch cups.\n\nAlso, make sure you have to pee when you go there so that you can use the bathrooms.  The stalls are 2-sided mirrors so you can see everyone while you're in there, but they can't see you!  It's crazy!\n\nCouple of downsides: it's pretty dark in there.  I mean really dark.  Sometimes I wish they would turn up the lights just a little bit.  Also, the dress code isn't consistent.  We've gone in there wearing scruffy clothes and casual shoes before, but one time we were turned away because a friend was wearing sneakers.

Couches are comfy, its awesome. \n\nThe drinks are a bit expensive, unless you go on happy hour. Expect to pay from $8-$12 a cocktail. Other than that, I still give this place 5 stars :)\n\nI really don't recommend this place for groups..  unless its a group of women lol and if you are a group of guys, and you go in when there's a group of women, then you lucked out lol \n\nI see this place more of a laid back, chill place for a guy bringing that special someone. So that's my tip to the guys!!!"

They even have a numerical scale indicating the wackiness of the ingredients. Of course, we ordered the craziest stuff they had to offer.\n\nAt a 3.5 on their 5 point scale, the \"Duke Silver\" with Scotch, bitters, and apricot wasn't that outrageous and was similar to a dark Manhattan. The \"Dill-iverence\" with aquavit, dill, Spanish vermouth, and pickled garlic garnish tasted like pickle juice. Combining Scandinavian influences to evoke a backwoods \"Deliverance\" was playful and completely deserved the 4.5 wacky rating. But down south, they'd say you're crazy to pay $11 for pickle juice. Both drinks were heavy which didn't inspire us to have a second round.\n\nThe atmosphere was dark and tacky like a strip club. With music supplied by a DJ, there wasn't much of a vibe."

We'd driven by the place several times and never knew what it was.  Well, it is an absolutely cool bar/lounge with awesome drinks, that's what!\n\nThe \"hidden\" door was hilarious and we shared a good laugh over it with the doorman. Inside, it is very dark, beautiful couches/lounge chairs, lovely bar.  We were seated in the lounge and our server was really fun (and cute).  She explained some of the drinks and answered our questions.  It was a little too dark to read the menu, so she  adjusted the lighting when she saw us struggling.  A DJ was spinning old R&B/neo soul when we arrived, then segwayed into deep house.  It wasn't so loud that we couldn't hold a conversation, and we enjoyed people-watching.\n\nAnd the drinks- yummy! I initially got some sort of strawberry concoction and was seriously trying to eat the fruit out of it after I finished. I then ordered a pineapple mojito (not on the menu), which was good, but not as good as my first drink. Next time, I'll stick to the menu- those guys know what they are doing.\n\nPrices were quite reasonable and less than Strip prices, around $10-$12 each.  I'd definitely go again; it was a fun spot to start the evening."

OK fine, several times. \n\nBut I'm trying to improve my ways and get to know the parts of Vegas that the locals frequent. My tour guide Drew A suggested this fantastic, dim little spot downtown where we could get reasonably priced (well, reasonable for Vegas) and beautiful cocktails. I hesitate to say craft cocktails or mixology or any of those other terms that are thrown around too often lately, but at its core these drinks are truly artisan, with interesting ingredients, no overly sweet fillers, and passionate bartenders creating each one. The drinks on the cocktail menu range from $9 to $11, and for about $55, 4-6 people can enjoy one of their punch bowls. Definitely something I'm going to suggest the next time I'm in town with a group! \n\nI'm a big fan of a place that doesn't feel the need to be overly flashy or gimmicky in a city that might be considered one of the flashiest in the world. Props to you guys  - keep up the good work!"

They have a drink with cheese in it that is a 4.5 so I wouldn't say I am too unadventurous.\n\nI had the Peruvian Starfish which was brandy, muddled blackberries, saffron and something else. It was very rich and complex. I was sad when it was over. It was probably the best drink I have had in a very long time.

There weren't too many people in the bar so we grabbed a table with no problems. It was about 10 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order. We ordered three drinks and spent the next 25 minutes waiting. With the amount of customers there, there's no way it should have taken that long for one beer and two cocktails. When our drinks finally came, our server said, \"sorry it took a minute. Your ticket got lost or something, I'm not sure.\" She was very nonchalant and the \"apology\" lacked sincerity. \n\nThat left me kind of annoyed...

We began with drinks at Vanguard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vanguard-lounge-las-vegas-2#hrid:o9wbcXpWZ6Wmilt_zrqsSA) which led to drunken debauchery down Fremont Street with my girlfriends. Prior to that night, I had never set foot in Downtown Cocktail Room, so myself and another friend had to find its entrance -- try doing that in the dark while intoxicated. \n\nAfter a minute or two of pushing on walls and tapping on the windows, one of my friends discovers the entrance. The inside of Downtown Cocktail Room wasn't what I was expecting: Chic and sexy, this bar / lounge is something I'd expect to visit if I were in another major city like Los Angeles. It has a sophisticated air to it. With that being said, perhaps that's why my friend and I couldn't order certain drinks:\n\nMy friend and I: \"I want a B******!\"\nBartender: \"Sorry, we're not that kind of bar.\"\nMy friend and I: \"Uh....\"\n\nApologies for trying to trash up the place! But anyway, I ordered two beverages for myself and the bride-to-be. Unfortunately, I don't recall their names, but they were good, bubbly and sweet alcoholic drinks (that's saying a lot.). What I do recall is that I didn't have to shell out $20 on one drink, but on TWO drinks, and that's including tip. Aside from the reasonably priced drinks, I like how you can actually sit down on couches and have a conversation with friends. This typically isn't something that's easy to do if you're on The Strip, because there are few places that offer that luxury. \n\nWhy head down to The Strip to sip expensive drinks in swanky lounges or bars? Downtown Cocktail Room is much more chill, unpretentious, and the cost of the drinks won't put a huge dent in your wallet."

Thanks to Yelp I was able to actually enter the building while only making a slight fool of myself.   Without this site I probably would have amused the patrons sitting inside for 10-15 minutes instead of the 30 seconds it still took me.   Once inside I had a seat at the bar with my companion and we ordered some fries off the happy hour menu (provided by Uncle Joe's Pizza) and some of the snacks the bar regularly has on hand (wasabi peas and Olives).   Since it was happy hour I decided to try some of their handcrafted original drinks since they're only $7 during HH.   The food showed up before our drinks (more on that later).   The fries were hot, seasoned well and cooked just right.   The Wasabi Peas and Olives tasted as expected but I liked the option of having those as snacks throughout the night.  \n\nI was a little disappointed that some of the drinks I'd seen on their website were seemingly not available as they are seasonal, but I settled for what they did have and started with the Irish Rain Barrel.   It was good but not really my thing (I dont like cucumber and it has cucumber in it, so my fault completely on being an idiot).   Next I had Hemingway Daiquiri, which I thought was very well made, strong and delicious.   I let the bartender know how much I enjoyed it and he recommended I try an Aviation.   I'm all about recommendations from professionals (and conversely, am not too fond of recommendations from nearly anyone else), so I tried it and sure enough found it to be very good.  \n\nAfter a while another friend showed up who was on a completely different wavelength that night and I ended up \"forced\" into a few $5 Jameson shots, which I thought was a fair price.  \n\nAbout the wait:  the bartender when we first arrived seemed a bit overwhelmed with the drink orders he had and was receiving and it did take a long time for him to make our 1st round of drinks (probably 10+ minutes).   He seemed very apologetic and it was clear that he was busy the entire time and not just playing Candy Crush Saga on his phone, so it didn't really bother me too much.   Had I stopped in just for a quick drink though and not planned to spend an hour+ there, I dont think I would have found it a 4-star experience.   Outside of that, I found the service to be extremely friendly and helpful and the drinks fairly priced and strong."

DCR has given me another reason for being a frequent visitor of this part of Las Vegas. I'm quite impressed with the drinks and the atmosphere of DCR. \n\nI hate that I didn't know about DCR sooner! I'm guessing because it's tucked in the corner of Freemont and Las Vegas Blvd, that it didn't catch my eye. But, because of my love for chill lounges with cool atmospheres AND house music, I had to hit this place up. \n\nUpon entering DCR on a Saturday night, we are greeted by a bouncer, who made me feel welcomed right from the get go. While I jokingly tested his bouncer skills by challenging him to check my fiance's and my ID's at the same time, he was personable and sweet as he complimented my fiance and I for being a great pair. :)\n\nInside DCR is probably as dark as the outside night or even darker and the chill sound of jazzy lounge house awaits (think thievery corporation sounding music). I am relieved that they weren't playing the usual club house or electronic music you would find at the clubs on the strip! I am instantly excited and eager to grab a drink so I can settle down in one of their spacious seating areas. \n\nI take a look at their summer menu, which by the way, is very reasonably priced and quite a sophisticated selection, and decide to test a bartender's skills by ordering a drink off the menu. The drink I ordered is a mix of a bloody mary and a margarhita. The bartender asks me to take a sip off his creation and I let him know that I wanted something a bit more on the margarhita side. A little squeeze of the lime and bam! my perfect little drink. \n\nOur cocktail server was real sweet and made sure that we were doing well and that I wasn't too drunk :P. I feel it's rare to find a cocktail server who is not just attentive to the guests BUT at the same time cares about our well being and safety. \n\nAnyway, I love this place! It's so chic and classy that I have to remind myself that I'm in Vegas still because this is nothing like anything you will find on the strip or anywhere else in LV. I think this place is going to be my happy place in LV since lots of places in LV irritate me due to the high saturation of douchieness and whackness in which DCR lacks :)."

Once you walk in through the hidden entrance the whole speakeasy concept just sets the atmosphere right, then you sit at a bar that seems to be designed to beautifully highlight the bartender instead of a distraction of bottles piled high on the wall like most bars. The bartender we had was AMAZING!! I believe her name was Connie. It was like she took our hand and walked us through a night of amazing cocktails. Some off of the menu and others just off the top of her head that were incredible!! I highly recommend this bar and will definitely be visiting soon!! \n\nMatt"

It's small, it's dark and they make specialty cocktails that take like 10 mins (totally exaggerating) to make and require a ton of ingredients.\n\nIt's a great place to start an evening out at. The cocktails I have tried have all been good. And compared to the strip, the price is great. Like fancy drinks for less than $20. Whaaa?!?! \n\nThe bartenders take the time to explain and recommend cocktails, and they seem to take pride in what they do. It's cool.\n\nOh, and I love the women's restroom. One-sided mirrors, so when you're sitting on the John you can watch the girls outside of your stall adjusting their hair and make-up. Haha... it's funny."

The seating is elegant and intimate. \nDefinitely a must go for a date."

The upscale feel, original drink concoctions, best staff, and the how do I get in here door separate this place from the rest. \n\nDo yourself a favor and order a punch bowl, the celebration punch (winter menu) is the best! Two options: small or large ranging from $54-104 but with enough people it comes down to maybe $10 a person and a priceless buzz! The small serves around 6-8 people generously and the large 10-15, sorry 9th person. \n\nThe main bar tender I always see is Jeff (ponytail, can't miss him) He's so friendly and takes pride in his art. I ordered a drink and he asked if I liked it, I said I didn't, my fault for not likening Guinness or tequila yet ordering it anyway, he remade the drink for me at no additional cost and was focused on every guest's experience. Also, Leeza is a great hostess! Tip her well! \n\n\nLive DJ plays Wednesday thru Saturday. If you want an idea of the chill music, look up plej pandora station and enjoy!"

Unique cocktails that you won't find anywhere else which change often with a few favorites available, Absinthe drinks, some craft beers, and your standard well drinks. \n\nThe entrance is hard to find. It's funny to see people who have never been here figure out how to enter, cool bathrooms where it gives the illusion people can see you on the toilet (they can't, I've tested it out with my friend), a small, intimate, sexy, dark lounge atmosphere with a DJ usually playing house music. It's a good spot for locals and your out-of-town friends.\n\nTip: Bring a jacket. It's always cold here!"

Got busier as the night wore on.  Bartenders were friendly, and I tried one of their specialty cocktails from their menu...something that the bartender described as \"liquid pumpkin pie\" because it was pumpkin-flavored.  I liked it.\n\nThey had a DJ that night spinning r&b-type grooves; a sax player jammed along and walked through the crowd.  Lots of 20-somethings seem to like this place. I like it too.  I'll be back...\n\nOh yeah, and the doorman got a good laugh when we tried to get in through the \"hidden\" door."

            "review": "Part of the allure of the Downtown Cocktail Room is idea of finding your way into a semi-secret bar (which is well publicized by us on Yelp).  I just wish they hadn't put a neon cocktail sign out in front as a clue.  \n\nSince I'm a pretty crafty person (not in a paint by numbers kind of way, but in a Mission Impossible kind of way) it took about 2 seconds to bust my way into this cocktail joint.  Frankly, I wanted more of a challenge.  Downtown Cocktail Room, you made it too frickin easy.  Had you been a real speakeasy, the prohibition squad would have shut you down on day one.  You know how it would have went down ......\n\nSIRENS\nCHERRY TOPS\nBLUE SUITED FLAT FOOTS\nBILLY CLUBS, SAPS & CUFFS\nSOMEBODY SCREAMS\nSLAMMER TIME \n\nCut to:\n\nThe here and now -\n\nOnce inside, you find a cozy bar, which is dimly lit.  It's the kind of place where you could literally fade into the background if you just didn't move.  \"Boo! ... Sorry for being creepy and making you spill your drink\" ....  It also reminded me a lot of the Saints & Sinners Bar of Culver City, which is now closed (but the memory lives on courtesy of the Yelp archives).   \n\nSince this was our first stop on a Friday night, I was pleased to find the place relatively quiet (at 8:00 p.m.) and with available stools to land at the counter bar.  Known for their designer cocktails, the mixologist didn't disappoint.  Disclaimer:  For me, just breaking out the shaker, means I'm getting a fancy drink.  The prices were good and I was pleased with the vibe of the place.  Since it was a little early in the evening, there wasn't too much hustle and bustle.  \n\nAt the time, it was a nice respite from things to come on Fremont Street.  A place to get things started with a couple of drinks and get up to speed.  Yes, there's a system to the consumption of adult beverages, especially when you know you'll soon be switching to 40 ounce Modelo Especial beers and exchanging high fives with random homeless people watching an AC/DC tribute band play at the 3rd Street stage.\n\nEarly in the night, Downtown Cocktail Room is a nice place to chill and enjoy a couple of drinks.  Later on, I'm sure the place picks up the pace.  Stop here to test your orienteering skills (without cheating to research a point of entry online) and to enjoy a well crafted cocktail.\n\nTIP - If you make it out onto Fremont Street, DO exchange some enthusiastic high fives with strangers, but remember to generously apply hand sanitizer immediately afterward (but in a covert way).  Cheers!"

Very nice drink, kind of tasted just the right amount of sour and cucumber (which sounds weird but it worked).\n\nBartenders weren't busy yet, it was still early, so they were attentive and fun to chat with, even offered helpful hints on mixing and stuff.  It's always cool to hear experts talk about what they're good at, especially if they're good people.\n\nOther clientele were interesting and fun.

We had been to DCR once before a year prior and had left thinking that the drinks were good and obviously well made by talented bartenders.  However, as enjoyable as our drinks were, my selections from the Fall cocktail menu were a bit sweeter than I prefer my drinks to be.  However, upon coming back to Vegas, it was a no-brainer to hit DCR again.  I was not disappointed.  \n\nStepping into the dimly lit, relaxed bar, if felt a bit like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in a good way as our very skilled bartender, Kevin, was the very same bartender who served us on our previous visit.  I started with the Orthodox Caveman ($11) made with Zucca Amaro, Cachaca, Scotch, and an unspecified apertif and unidentified bitters.  I should've asked.  It was boozy without any cloying sugariness, just a hint sweetness most likely from the amaro and apertif.  It was a balanced, complex and outstanding.  Next, I ordered the Black Widow ($10), although the Orthodox Caveman was a tough act to follow.  It consisted of Meletti Amaro, Cynar, Infused Vermouth, and Mole bitters, which combined in potent, tasty way.  Like the Orthodox Caveman, the Black Widow possessed only passing sweetness.  Most importantly, it was satisfying.  \n\nOn this night, I gained a much deeper appreciation for DCR's well-conceived, precisely executed cocktails.  DCR stands tall as perhaps Vegas' top purveyor of craft cocktails."
