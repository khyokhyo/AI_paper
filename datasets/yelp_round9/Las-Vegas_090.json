            "review": "Just left a lunch service that took a little more than 2 hours. Food is delicious. Grilled octopus was bomb. Lobster pasta great. Sea bream fantastic. The menu is on the pricey side but at lest the food is good. So why 3 stars? Service. It was garbage.\n\nI think we were forgotten from the get go. We sat around without so much as a menu or introduction from our server. When that wait got way too long we flagged down a random server and asked for some menus. He apologized and said he would find our server for us. We saw him approach the guy who would eventually announce himself as our server, but our server still didn't come by for another 10 minutes at least. Finally a busser took mercy on us and brought bread and filled our water 20-25 min after being seated. When the server finally came by he asked if we'd like something to drink. Fortunately by that time we'd had plenty of time to memorize the menu and said we were ready to order. He appeared perplexed. He took our order and left. 10-15 min later he said he couldn't find our drink order in the computer. Huh? We said we handnt ordered drinks and he said \"oh ok\" and left. My wife assumes that when he asked if we would like drinks and we responded that we were ready to order that what he actually heard was we had \"already\" ordered drinks. \n\nA different server brought out our appetizers because she said she didn't want them to get cold while waiting for the third appetizer to come out.  Thanks for looking out, though it makes me wonder why there would be such a lag between three appetizers in a prix fixe menu. Perhaps our server didn't fire things or time them properly?\n\nWe asked the busser and a different server (since ours was nowhere to be found) for a bread/oil/butter refill about 4 times before it finally came. \n\nOnce the main courses came out and the food was delicious I mellowed out a little bit. Figured, well, rough start but hopefully now we can finish on a high note. We finished eating and sat with dirty empty plates for easily 10-15 min. Eventually someone else cleared the table and i figured dessert was incoming. Nope. \n\n20 minutes later (I know because my sister called and we had plenty of time to chat, watch my nephew via FaceTime open his Xmas gift, etc), the manager (I assume, he was wearing a suit) brings us our melted ice cream. \n\nSo seriously, wtf? Tables around us that were captained by other servers were turned over in less than half the time we sat there with our thumbs up our proverbial you know whats. A table right behind us sat 30 min after us, and they were done, table cleared, and the next group had menus in hand and drink orders in while we were asking other people (not our server) for the check. Another server (not ours) picked up the check for us when we were ready to pay. \n\nAll I can figure is that our guy was in over his head from the word go and never caught up. His colleagues tried to pick up some of his slack but they have their own sections to run - and to be honest looked like they were doing alright. So bad luck on our part, but this is supposed to be a nice restaurant charging premium dollars...they're supposed to get it right every time, right? \n\nI will withhold the name of the server from this review, but I did leave a note on my receipt indicating my dissatisfaction with our service."

Everything we ate was so fresh, delicious and beautifully prepared, and the space is beautiful. I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Meals for 35+ people can be a challenge, but our meal (four different starter plates, entree and dessert platters) was very well paced and every dish that came out was excellent.\n\nThe servers went above and beyond to make sure that our guests had a great experience and I will definitely be eating here again on my next trip to Las Vegas.\n\nDon't miss these menu items:\nMilos special appetizer\nTomato salad with Feta\nGrilled Shrimp appetizer\nLavraki with capers\nSemolina customer phyllo pastry dessert"

We each had the $20.12 lunch menu which included 3 courses.  We also ordered one glass of wine ($7.50) and still water ($8 for a bottle of Evian Pure 750 ml, about 25 ounces) to share.  To save money I should have just asked for tap water.\n\nFive stars because:\n- $20.12 for 3 courses including choice of seafood appetizers and entrees is a bargain in such a nice restaurant inside The Cosmopolitan, no less.  This deal is available 7 days a week from 12 pm - 2:30 pm, I need to come back more often.\n- Food was excellent.  She chose the scallop appetizer, salmon entree and Walnut Pie dessert.  I had the Greek Meze Plate appetizer, shrimp entree and yogurt dessert.  The complimentary bread with olive oil was also tasty (though my friend thought the crust was too hard, but in Europe lots of bread crusts are hard).  Warning: At fancy, schmancy restaurants such as this place the portion sizes are kinda small.  If really hungry, just ask for more of the complimentary bread.\n- Service was great.  One attendant even scrapped the bread crumbs off our table.\n- Their terrace dining area is wonderful and they have those heater-pillar-things to keep diners warm if the weather's chilly."

If I recall, the quote was that it was \"very beautiful and very cold and you can't touch anything.\"  This place has a little of that vibe to it. Fortunately, the food is excellent.\n\nIf you're looking for a lunch spot, and you have friends to impress, I would bring them here.  I think the prix fixe menu is up to $25 these days (it used to be something like $20.12 in 2012, etc.), but it is well worth the money.  The salmon was absolutely perfect, and you should really try the Greek yogurt dessert. The wait staff is attentive and you'll never see the bottom of your water glass.  With wine and tip, you'll probably drop over $100 for a lunch, but you'll be talking about this place for the rest of the day."

The choices are somewhat meager 3 or 4 options for appetizer and main course and the uninspiring choice of plain Greek yogurt or a sparse mixed fruit plate for dessert.  If you choose some of the better choices (grilled octopus appetizer or lamb chop) there are \"supplemental charges\".   I ordered the Salmon and it came out mushy indicating it was probably frozen at some point.  Was hoping for something much better.   Lunch for 2 with a glass of wine each came to close to $100.  Would suggest for others to check out the lunch menu before seating.   As for me, I'll check out many of the other great food options in Las Vegas and won't return"

Their menu has items for sharing, or you can go at it on your own.\n\nWe had: skordalia, tatima, Milo's special, two orders of the octopus, grilled sea bass, and the Greek salad. Afterwards we had the loukamades. I do have to confess that we are Greek so navigating the menu is really easy but if you stick with any of those items than you'll do just fine.

And this was so good.  As far as entrees go, I had a wonderful grilled sea bass and they made an equally delicious spanikopita-like entree for my vegetarian friend.  \n\nIf you are looking for a great meal and have money to burn, dine here.

Most dishes & sides are big enough to be shared.\n\nFor appetizers: fried eggplant/zucchini w yogurt sauce (lovely), tomato salad (refreshing & flavorful) and the grilled octopus (incredible!). I never thought I'd like octopus, but this dish made me a fan!\n\nMain: fresh fish baked in sea salt - this was completely covered in a thick bed of salt, then served up at our table by the head chef himself. Very tender, moist & tasty, just wish we had more. Ribeye steak - so tender & melty, full of flavor.\n\nSides: Horta - saut\u00e9ed greens, loved the slightly bitter taste, was my favorite of the veggies. Beet salad (yum), Fried potatoes (a solid crisp French fry).\n\nService was attentive and efficient. The only thing I didn't like was the server took my drink away before I was finished, but other than that we were given top-notch service, with visits by the head chef himself welcoming us, serving us & checking how we liked the food. \n\nDefinitely pricey, even more so than the NYC location, but hey, it's Vegas...everything is more $$$$ there!"

            "review": "It's a pity the service was so poor at this place because it has a lot of potential. My husband and I ate dinner at Estiatoria Milos last weekend. We were really put off the service. The waiters were really pushing the fresh fish on us - which of course looked amazing - but the fish choices that they had left when we arrived could have fed a family of 4, not a couple of 2 who were simply interested in drinking and sampling a variety of items.  I'm about 100 pounds soaking wet and have zero interest in some big hunk of fish that should feed 2 or 3 of me! My preference is to taste many flavors instead.\n\nWe proceeded to oder several appetizers to split as our dinner, and all was very tasty. However, when we ordered this way, it acted as an immediate trigger to our waiters to ignore us for the remainder of the time at the restaurant. In addition, they proceeded to deliver all appetizers within minutes of each other -- they put in ZERO effort to make sure they spaced everything out. What was funny was that the restaurant was about 1/2 full -- they should've milked the fact that they had two people drinking $20-25 glasses of wine and kept us there so we'd drink more. Total bummer because I've wanted to try this place for a while."

            "review": "Most of the reviews I've read on here are for their lunch specials, which is great, but I wanted to give a review for their dinner. \n\nUpon entering, we were greeted by the hostesses, friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was elegant, and each table was laden with a swanky lookin group of people or cute couples on dates. The dress code, for the most part, is semi-casual, but we were dressed casually and didn't feel out of place. \n\nWe were greeted by our \"drink server\"... At least that's what I remember him for. I told him what kind of drinks I normally like, which, lately, is vodka and nothing too sweet. He came out with a refreshing vodka cucumber cocktail. My boyfriend got the \"them apples\" martini, and my friend got a scotch and soda. $15-18 each drink.\n\nNext off, we were greeted by our food server. The whole ordering process with our  food server is what may have thrown me off from the entire dining experience. I felt that he was somewhat pushy and rushed us to order. Here's the thing about Milo's dinner experience. If you plan to order fish (which our server made it seem like you should know from the get-go what you want without looking at the menu ugh... -_-), then you get to take a look at the \"fish market\" and you get to pick out the fish you would like. They filet it up, grill it and serve it family style at your table (FYI everything is family style). Each fish is anywhere from $50-60/lbs. Most of it looked fresh, but I'm really not impressed by how the server presented, he gave brief descriptions, went down the line, and then expected us to have a choice after his rambling. I feel like having him explain 10 different kinds of fish right then and there and expecting me to choose one right off the bat, forced me into choosing a lobster lol... A $108 dollar lobster--my goodness!\n\nAnyhow, lets talk about the food! For starters, they brought out a bread basket along with our 12 dozen of fresh oysters--probably my favorite part of our meal. We had 2 different kinds, I forget what they were called, but one was more briney in flavor while the other one was creamier. Both awesome! I think this came out to $40? Ish? Lol\n\nAfter what seemed like forever (maybe 30 minutes, pretty long time for a salad if you ask me), our Greek salad came out. Served family style, the salad was comprised of beef steak tomatoes, chopped into chunks, sliced cucumbers, green bell peppers, and olives tossed in a light vinaigrette, topped with two fresh slices of feta cheese. It was good, but the tomatoes could have been sweeter--I mean for $28, you deserve sweet tomatoes right? ;)\n\nNext, the lobster came out along side the filet that we ordered (yeah, we decided to order a filet mignon, as well). The lobster was boiled, cut in half, and served up simple and pretty on a platter. It was pretty big! Juicy, tender, not at all rubbery, it was delicious! If it wasn't $108, I'd eat it all the time lol! The filet mignon was nothing spectacular. I mean, it was really good, but come on--we live in Vegas, there's a million steakhouses out here, and this piece of filet wasn't changing my life haha... It came out to $68 (I think?). I also ordered a Greek wine, which drank like a pinot noir, it was pretty good ($15) with the steak.\n\nAnyhow, the three of us shared all the food, and the bill came out to about $350 including tip. My poor boyfriend and friend were still hungry after our meal haha!\n\nMaybe I just need to give it another shot, but I wasn't very happy about our dinner experience at Milo's. Our pushy server may have been what made it so lame, but I wasn't too ecstatic by the prices either. To me, the food and service didn't fit the bill. If you've got the money, give it a go. Let me know what you think."

Fresh fish, perfect flavors, great venue and impressive fish ice display.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is one of our favorites. Estiatorio Milos is located in The Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas (bring Estiatorio to SF pleaaaase!). We love the simple and elegant d\u00e9cor (i.e. the white marble flooring imported from Athens). Our waiter explained that their fresh fish are flown in DAILY from the Mediterranean - some of the fish were still alive on the ice display. The vegetables are impeccable as well!\n\nWe highly recommend our favorite dish: the Milos special (thin slices of zucchini and eggplant paired with kefalograviera cheese) - delish!!! We also like the grilled octopus served with revythada (chickpeas from Santorini) and of course, the grilled fish seasoned with olive oil and fresh lemon juice - that's exactly how they do it in Santorini. We chose the fish that we wanted from the impressive ice display (the fish is priced by the pound). We can't wait to go back! It's only an hour flight away from SF instead of the 10-hour flight to Santorini, Greece, haha."

I'm not talking about tender for an octopus, I'm talking actually cut with a fork tender.\n\nFor the main course I had the grilled mediterranean bass. It is the same fish that is on the dinner menu for a much higher price. It comes as a whole fish so look out if you are grossed out about that. It is lightly grilled with a drizzle of citrus and olive oil. It tasted super fresh and was cooked perfectly so it was not dried out in the least.\n\nFor dessert, I had the yogurt parfait that was fruit and greek yogurt. A simple, perfect addition to a delicious lunch.\n\nBottom line, everything was super fresh, light and perfectly cooked and was the right amount for a lunch portion.  I'll say it again, for my money this is one of the absolute best lunch deals in the whole city."

            "review": "The food was good but not outstanding and the prices were very high.  I live in Chicago and I can get comparable food in Greektown at probably half the price.  Service was excellent though and the restaurant's ambience was really nice and upscale.\n\nThe grilled octopus appetizer was very good, meaty and tender chunks of charred octopus and some nice tomatoes and olives.  The signature fried zucchini appetizer was delicious.\n\nWe had the grilled LAVRAKI (Mediterranean sea bass) which was nicely prepared, moist, meaty and tender.  It was just a squeeze of lemon juice away from perfection  - luckily, there was plenty of lemon on the plate too!  The downside is that this fish was $53/pound and the smallest one they had was 2.5 lbs so that was a $125 fish.  Wow, that's steep.  Sharing it with the 3 people at our table made it a bit more reasonable but that's still pretty pricey.  A la carte too - all you get is fish.  All the fish was about the same in price, all in the $50-60/pound range.  The least expensive were the sardines - but still $32/pound ... huh?  Sardines?  I can get sushi grade tuna for $15/pound.\n\nGrilled lambchops were pretty good.  You get two huge pork chop sized domestic lambchops.  They were a bit mild for my taste and could have used some aggressive seasoning or sauce to give some oomph.\n\nRibeye steak was ... ribeye steak.  What's Greek about that?  Can't complain too much though ... after all, we ordered it.\n\nThe desserts were just ok.  The fried donut holes with honey did not taste very fresh.  The egg custard phyllo dessert was also ... meh.\n\nThe drinks were competently prepared and there's a nice list of wines (Greek and otherwise) by the glass."

The walnut cake was bland, and in my opinion, kind of dry- but the other two options more than made up for it. The scallops came with mandarin orange slices and red onions- which both seemed like an odd fit before I tried them together, but it was a perfect fit. The sea bass was a simple presentation, just lemon, olive oil and capers, I think, with a single piece of broccoli, but it was perfectly prepared. As I understand, the dinner is many many times more expensive, but for a classy lunch- this was perfect."

            "review": "My brother, Marcus, my fianc\u00e9, Ruben, and I secured a lunch reservation at noon to try the well-known $20.13 (last year they started with $20.12 for 2012, you get the theme) lunch menu. I heard much about their signature dishes, plus, Ruben and I stalked the menu for our selections the previous evening, so we knew exactly what we wanted.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. Right as the doors opened and we walked In, I exclaimed, \"Wow.\" The dining area is open, inviting, and modern. I loved the fresh produce and fish displayed near the kitchen! The patio seating looked beautiful with a nice view of the strip (I really wanted to sit out there!). The music was light and appropriate. Definitey a great ambiance.\n\nYou begin with crunchy, chewy charred/grilled sourdough bread with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), made in-house I believe, that was delicious, fruity, and went perfectly with the bread. We had a couple baskets, hehe. \n\nWe all ordered from the prie fixe lunch menu and from the a la carte menu as well. Since there were three of us, there were many dishes to try!\n\nFor our appetizers, we shared the following:\nCALAMARI (off the a la carte menu): I couldn't walk away from a restaurant that receives fresh seafood from Greece and the Mediterranean without trying their fried calamari. This particular creature probably didn't come from either of those exotic areas (since the menu would have indicated), but nonetheless, it was delicious! Lightly fried with lemon and seasoned perfectly. The tartness and fruitiness from the lemon during its cooking process definitely set it apart from other calamari dishes. \nGREEK MEZE PLATE: A trio of Greek dips (tarama, htipati, and tzatziki) served with fresh pita bread, manouri cheese (crumbly texture similar to feta, but much milder and creamier), cherry tomatoes, and kalamata olives. The htipati had a sort of cream cheese consistency and flavor; it is a Greek feta cheese spread. The tzatziki was creamy and full-bodied; delicious. The tarama was my least favorite - it initially reminded me of a fresh mustard (I understand that traditional tarama is made other cured and salted roe); didn't care for it alone, but it went well with the other dips.\nTOMATO SALAD: Feta cheese, seasoned with Greek herbs, and EVOO. Pretty standard salad that we identify as \"Greek.\" It was light, the dressing wasn't overbearing, and the feta cheese was nice and mild.\nGRILLED OCTOPUS ($10 supplementary): Sashimi-grade Mediterranean octopus that was char-broiled, then served with olive oil, capers, onions, and herbs. AMAZING! The octopus was flavorful, fresh, and just so fabulous. Ruben doesn't even care for seafood, however, fell in LOVE with this dish!\n\nMain courses:\nLAVRAKI: Our server informed us that this was one of their signature dishes. Fresh Mediterranean sea bass grilled lightly and served with a simple coating in EVOO, fresh lemon to squeeze, and herbs. Very light and surprisingly flavorful. Sea bass is definitely not my kind of fish, so it was not my favorite dish.\nHONJAKE SALMON: Honjake is a process of raising salmon in the most natural way possible. Thus, it yields tastier results for obvious reasons. It was lightly grilled and served with fresh lemon and broccoli. The salmon was really nice with a slight crunch on the outside. The \"steamed vegetable\" on the side was disappointing; there was barely any crunch to the broccoli (one of my food preparation peeves).\nNOVA SCOTIA DEEP SEA LOBSTER PASTA ($15 supplementary): Generous amounts of lobster tail and claw meat with a perfectly al dente linguine in a light tomato sauce. Holy moly, this was phenomenal. The sauce was perfect - it had the right spices and it was flavorful. The lobster was incredible too. YUM!\n\nFor desserts, we tried the WALNUT PIE WITH KAIMAKI ICE CREAM: The \"pie\" (consistency was more like cake)  was cinnamon-y and light, a bit sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The ice cream was..interesting. We found out it has some sort of pine residue or something, but it's a traditional Greek ice cream. I didn't like it and I told my brother that it may just be an acquired taste. I also tried the YOGURT MARTINI: Greek yogurt with some sort of raspberry compote (I can't think of what it was right now!). It was good, but pretty simple. The raspberry was a little tart for me (I'm not a fan of sour/tart), but the yogurt was creamy and of really nice quality.\n\nI would definitely go back for the octopus, calamari, and that scrumptious lobster pasta during lunch! Highly, highly recommended!"

Both my companion and I chose the prix-fixe lunch- three courses for 22.13.\n\nWe started with two great martinis, one with gin and cucumber, one with grapefruit.\n\nWe shared our appetizers, the tomato salad and the Greek meze plate. Both were fresh and well-seasoned. We especially enjoyed the fresh feta cheese, hummus, and whitefish roe.\n\nFor my entree I had the Mediterranean bass which was EXCELLENT! My companion had the salmon and was equally as satisfied.\n\nFor dessert, I had the walnut cake. It was done beautifully, but my companion's yogurt martini was really the highlight.\n\nWill definitely go back. Great food, great service, and a tremendous value for lunch. If you can, sit on their open-air terrace if the weather is nice. It added to the ambiance and the overall experience. Thanks, Milos!!!"

My two girlfriends and I decided to stop in at Milos and give it a try. They both love fish and with one being Greek herself, it was a no-brainer.\n\nImmediately after sitting down we all knew the night was going to be great when we were greeted by, for lack of a better word, a very sexy waiter who asked where we were from, what brought three lovely girls in, and chatted awhile. After finally asking for his name, we got it. Will. Girls, I'll get to the food in a moment, but you have to come to this restaurant alone just to see him. Dark deep voice, gorgeous eyes, and had us smiling and laughing the whole time. I swear Christy was going to jump him everytime she saw him (and she'll scream at me for this later).  But ahem, moving on....\n\nAfter getting drink orders in, we were again greeted by another very good-looking man, Tod. He took 2 of us to the fish market where you literally pick your own fish. I swear I should've taken notes. He explained every fish in detail from taste to origin, etc. I have to say, it seemed that everyone in the restaurant we spoke to was extremely knowledgeable. From the somm to the busser and of course Will and Tod. \n\nAfter we came back to the table, we spent a few minutes enjoying our wine and then the first appetizer arrived. Oh my God. So good. We went for the braised Mediterranean Octopus and Tomato Salad. These were both to die for. Will came over and told us it was it favorite pairing and so we asked him to sit with us, but unfortunately...no. But was probably a good thing seeing as he would definitely be pounced on if he stayed an extra second. \n\nThis is getting long so Ill sum it up. Our fish came, perfectly seasoned and extremely moist and delicate. Afterwards we finished our wine and of course, brought Will back to the table. Having trouble on deciding which dessert to enjoy between three and not wanting all three, we had a dilemma. He told us \"be right back girls\" and in 5 minutes had an extremely sweet dessert platter for us that included all three we wanted. Chocolate sin, baklava and svigous (spelling?) . I wont get into the rest of our conversation with him afterwards as some of it may be a little innapropriate, for especially on here (Again, shes going to hate me) but in one word to sum up the night, it was PERFECT.\n\nFood was amazing, ambiance was warm and inviting and the staff. Yum. Will, we will definitely be back again. Can't wait."

Be prepared that if you want some of the dishes that sound amazing, like the Lobster pasta, expect a supplemental charge.\n\nEstiatorio has a light and bright room which goes with the Greek feel and the focus on fish dishes.  We started with a minerally white wine that enhanced the fish dishes.  I had their signature fish split down the center with capers and a light sauce.  It was light and went perfectly with the wine but working through all those small bones was more work than I had expected. Lissa G went with the supplemental Lobster Pasta which had a generous amount of lobster. Fortunately it even came with the shell so she was able to dig in and get the tomalley.  In case you didn't know or probably may shy away from...Tomalley is the liver and pancreas of the lobster. It looks like a green paste inside the abdominal cavity of a cooked lobster. It is considered a delicacy and many people consider it the best part of a lobster. Enough on the education (if needed), it was f'n awesome, and really made the dish for us both.\n\nOh, did I mention, you get a dessert too for that price? Don't miss the yogurt dessert.\nService was great and the sommelier was very helpful since I'm not as familiar with whites as reds."

There is a Manhattan location, but it has been acclaimed as one of the top restaurants in all of Las Vegas, so I had to check it out there.\n\nWe started with the Mediterranean Spreads appetizer which included 3 different Greek dips.  As I swiped my pita bread through each one, the flavors got better and better.  The Taramosalata had whitefish caviar, olive oil & sweet onion.  It was good but I wish it had a stronger fish flavor.  The Skordalia was an almond, garlic & olive oil emulsion.  Basic but delicious.  The Htipiti was roasted Holland peppers, feta cheese & olive oil.  It has a strong pepper flavor, which I absolutely loved.  My favorite dip with the Tzatziki which is Greek yogurt, cucumber, and garlic.  It was thicker than other types of tzatziki I have had.\n\nWe ordered the Calamari as well which was lightly fried with lemon.  It was a bit over-salted but delicious none the less.\n\nEstiatorios Milos has a wonderful fresh fish selection.  My friend and I decided to share the Black Sea Bass for 2.  It was served with olive oil and lemon sauce.  Basic, but perfect for a summer fish dish.\n\n\nWe ended with Baklava.  Three bites of sweet, crunchy, flakey goodness.  Not how I would usually picture Baklava, but Milos' take is just as wonderful.  \n\nOverall, the service was spotty but everyone there was very knowledgeable"

Gone is the most low-key talked about $20.11 lunch special but here, today, in 2012 is the $20.12 special lunch menu.  This menu is available for a couple hours each day from noon to 2:30pm.  \n\nE. Milos is located inside the Cosmo hotel and casino, next to STK.  Myself and another Yelper who was eager to try their lunch special arrived and were seated right away.  We asked to sit close to the window.  If the weather was nice out, I think the balcony would be an ideal spot to dine.  We were here specifically for their three course lunch menu.  When I see the word \"Mediterranean\" I think of the Mediterranean Sea and all of delicacies the Sea may have to offer.\n\nThere's olive oil sitting on top of the table and they'll bring you a basket of grilled bread.  The bread was fresh, warm, and good.\n\nMy first (appetizer) course was the Grilled Octopus, which was a $10 supplement, and it tasted delicious.  Being born in Hawaii I grew up eating taco poke (octopus), and they were always made with straight-out-of-the-Pacific-Ocean-fresh octopus.  If you've had taco poke before, I can tell you that the freshness and taste of this octopus was the same.  Taco poke isn't grilled but Milos' grilled octopus works and still brings out the remarkable flavor held in the meat.\n\nMy second (main entree) course was the Lavraki, a grilled Mediterranean bass.  The bass tasted beautiful.  The plate was kept simple; the fish on olive oil, a few broccoli, garnish, and a slice of lemon.  Perfection, and a must recommend.\n\nMy third and final (dessert) course was the walnut pie with ice cream.  It was more like a cake topped with ice cream.  A delicious dessert to end a wonderful meal.  \n\nThe restaurant is brightly light, there's a display stocked with fish sitting on ice, a tank, and open kitchen.  I will be returning on a regular basis, E Milos has captured and redefined my definition of Mediterranean cuisine."

When the waiters did move fast it was to fill up wine so they could finish bottles and pop more open racking up the bill. I had to tell them 4 times no more wine for me. They don't ask they just ram wine down your glass when you're not watching. Most frustrating was most women at our table were clearly no longer drinking but they still kept filling their glasses higher and higher. There must have been 3-4 of undriken wine bottles worth left in glasses. The waiters seemed more like slimmy used car salesmen then great service staff at times.\n\nOf the food. Oysters were decent. Greek salad was good, fish was good but too salty, soft shell crab was no good it was average crab hidden in deep fried batter. Generally too much salt in everything.\n\nBy the end service had crawled to a halt save for the wine pouring. The staff seemed so indifferent to anything except pushing coffee and dessert at the end even when everyone was saying no.\n\nI short I would never go back, it was such a bad experience.

In fact, I only came here on a total whim but it turned out to the best decision ever. Their 3-course lunch meal for $20 is pretty difficult to beat. It was the perfect way to end one of the most tiring business trips I've ever taken. Service is really great, the setting is really nice (good for business or casual). If it's not too hot, be sure to sit outside because it really just makes the meal that much better. \n\nI went with my co-workers and we shared a bunch of dishes and everything tasted great but here are a few of my favorites:\n\nGrilled Octopus - Had just the right amount of chewy texture. Really great flavor. Definitely a table favorite\nLobster Pasta - Most pasta dishes are the same but what I REALLY appreciated about this dish was that they were GENEROUS with their lobster portions. For a $20 lunch meal, you'd figure there'd be tons of pasta and only a little bit of lobster. No sir, they definitely piled on the lobster.\nRoasted Beets - Our group just really likes beets and this side dish was just executed really well.\nGreek coffee - SUPER SUPER sweet but that's right up my alley so I fell in love with this. My co-workers? Not so much haha\n\nDefinitely a surprise hit for me considering I never like Greek food. But this restaurant has turned me into a believer."

I probably picked out 10-15 bones while eating... Made the meal less enjoyable as I had to diligently make sure I wasn't about to swallow a bone. The crab cake appetizer had a lot of crab in it but lacked flavor. \n\nMy favorite item was probably the yogurt. Very creamy and fresh... Probably the best yogurt I've ever had."

            "review": "We arrived as a group of 8 for lunch so I can understand slow(er) service, but this is the first fine (ahem) dining restaurant that's forgotten my main entree altogether.\n\nStarted out normal enough - bread and drink service was prompt.  Waiter was happy to take everyone's 3 course items.  I opted for two upgrades in the crab cake and lobster pasta.  \n\nCrabs cake was delicious, though portion was kind of small.  Appetizer though, I suppose.  The mustard emulsion sauce was excellent, and the beans brought an earthy flavor to the sweet crab that tasted very fresh.    Panseared exterior had a good crisp.  Great starter!\n\nThat's when it kind of went downhill.  After appetizer, I never got another refill of my iced tea, even asking twice.  Maybe it was because they were too busy finding the lobster for my main.   7 main entrees made it to the table...all but mine.  I waited patiently, figuring it might be backed up in the kitchen.  Waiter didn't even notice I wasn't eating until I flagged him 10 minutes later.  By then most of my friends were half way or more into their meals.\n\nAt last my pasta made it to the table.  One of my buddies had already finished, and I was a bit upset from the whole ordeal - you'd think a manager would come by and apologize...nope!  Anyway, inhaled my entree as to keep speed with my pals, so didn't really keep track of flavors.  But I do recall the lobster being tasty, so there's that.\n\nDessert was alright, the yogurt was probably the best choice as we all shared a bit f each.  \n\nIn the end, the wait staff comped my lunch, but I still never got my tea refill.  Fresh seafood is everywhere in this town, why suffer through bad service for it?"

I would have aimed to go in during lunch but I was occupied with some errands. \n\nThe drinks are not cheap but our sommelier, Mark, made sure that we are having a blast and enjoying our wine paired with food. Wait, should it be the other way around? \n\nIt should,  as our server Julius smile and introduced himself. We asked him on what he would recommend and what he likes. We picked of those things and just start ordering. \n\nFirst the amuse bouche to cleanse our palates from the prosecco and vodka we've been drinking since we were waiting at the bar. It was a lovely slice of fish that has lemon and oil on it. Then comes in the glasses and bottles of wine. Well, one at a time ofcourse. \n\nOur appetizers were sardines and charred octopus. Both were superb. They are tasty even you know that they are cooked with simple ingredients. It reminded me of home. Fresh, simple yet soulful. Then Milo's Special arrived. It has a lovely kefalograviera cheese.\n\nAs for the main course, we've had Colorado Prime lamb chops and a fish that has never been frozen and was flown in from Portugal. Name? I don't have that good of a memory. That cheese from the appetizer consumed it. But true to their word, it tasted like it was just caught out of the seas of Portugal. You can almost taste the sweetness of the meat. I did not really care much about the lamb but it was also done well. You don't have to fight for it when you take a bite. It is more an American flair and I'm at a better Greek restaurant so, why would I focus on what I can get everywhere. We have ordered tomato salad which is another thing to look forward to ordering next time I'm back. \n\nOverall, it was amazing dining here. It may have cost us a little more but when you're in company of great people. Who cares?"

            "review": "Expensive? Yes. Yet, lunch has just made it a little more reasonable. For the first time, I went for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have a lunch menu which is comprised of a choice of an appetizer, and entr\u00e9e, and dessert. The price for all three is under $30, unless you order certain types of appetizers that will cost you extra. The octopus was an extra $10 in the appetizer section and it is probably one of the best appetizers. There was a pasta with lobster that I believe was an extra $18 on top of the regular price of the whole meal. I ordered the octopus for appetizer and ordered chicken for lunch. The grilled octopus was delicious. The chicken was amazing and the fries that came with it, Greek potato fries, were awesome. My friend ordered both the octopus appetizer and the lobster pasta, which made her meal come out to about $50-$55 instead of being under $30. I thought that the lobster pasta was OK but I am not a fan of lobster. For dessert, I ordered the Greek yogurt which was incredibly good. My friend ordered the walnut cake which was also very yummy. This is a phenomenal restaurant and I have yet to have a bad meal here. It is a great chance to try a wonderful type of cuisine at a very prestigious restaurant for an affordable price if you have never been here before. The food is delicious. I have been here for dinner many times and each time has blown me away for how good it is. Again, it is expensive, but it is worth it for how good everything really is. Highly recommended for those that love food!"

I was left in awe after the meal. \n\nOrdered their lunch 3 course meal for a very general price of $20.12. They apparently increase the price one cent a year. Get it?? ;)\n\n1) Sashimi grade Octopus was cooked to perfection! I could understand why they had to charge extra to get that as your appetizer. It was worth every penny. It was cooked so well, not chewy or undercooked and bursting with flavor from their salt/pepper, onions, capers, and lemon. Definitely recommend! I could understand why it was a top item to order.\n\n2) Scallops - skewer style grilled and it was sooo good. Think this is the best cooked scallop I have ever had. Definitely recommend it. It was perfectly seasoned and absolutely cooked to perfection.\n\n3) Lavraki - grilled bass - this was surprisingly very good. I don't usually eat the fish skin but boy this was soo wel flavored, I ate everything but the bones. It was that good. Definitely without a doubt recommend this fish to order!\n\n4) Walnut Cake was pretty decent too. Not too big of a fan with walnuts but I'm sure any walnut lover would love this dish."

            "review": "I went with 4 close friends looking to grab a bite on our way out for a great evening.  Whether it was 4 guys in a she she restaurant or not being on an expense account, boy did we pick the wrong venue!  We all enjoy quality food and a good time.  When the waiter, who was MIA most of the night, asked us if we had ever been there before, it would have been a great idea for him to mention how petite the portions were.  Instead he mentioned something about family style.  We ordered the calamari which he suggested.  It was cut in 4 pieces the size of the tip of my pinky.  It was a joke for $26.  really, $26.  Could he have mentioned that we should get several apps due to the size?  YES!  I felt like a complete idiot for picking this item for us to order.  As there were several folks serving our table, on a few occasions they had to be reminded that we had ordered another drink and this seemed pretty disappointing based on the type of restaurant we were visiting.  The main course of salmon was fine, but nothing different than my wife prepares at home.  My friends dishes were also fine, but we all had that sinking feeling that we would need to go out to dinner after we left the restaurant as the portions were so small.  I don't normally eat much bread and instead consumed 3 pieces as a way to fill my belly.  While we all made jokes about the experience and left happy and laughing, the portions, prices and disheveled wait staff made it a memorable experience, in a bad way.  While we are all good wage earners, either back up the excessive pricing with decent value (portions) or don't charge so much.  I can't really stomach spending over $100 a person for 2 drinks, 1 app shared and 1 entree, and poor service.  It was stupid.  I realize how much happier I would have been if I could have rewinded the evening and just had some comfort food.  Based on the reviews, I should have asked for the power lunch at dinner!"

            "review": "I found about this restaurant's lunch deal and made a reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip to Las Vegas! $25.15 for a 3-course prix-fixe price (excluding upgrades) - like what beats that on the Vegas strip?! \n\nMy first impression of this restaurant was terrific! It is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. If you go up the escalators, make an immediate left. It is located between two restaurants, STK and Blue Ribbon. The decor of the place is beautiful and formal, fits the Mediterranean theme. I would have loved to sit outdoor but didn't want to sweat in the Vegas heat. The outdoor seating overlooks the strip.. it would be great to dine outside for dinner! The only thing that \"threw\" the place off was the seafood laying out at the right of the restaurant. But little did I know that you walk over there to pick the fish you want in your stomach, which is pretty neat.\n\nMy friends and I quickly got our drinks as well as their complimentary bread with olive oil. Supposedly, the bread is toasted over an open flame! We had two waiters, who were fantastic. We couldn't decide what to get for the appetizers, so one of the waiters recommended 3 to us to share.\n\nFood we ordered:\n-Appetizers:\nTomato Salad (Feta cheese, seasoned with Greek herbs & extra virgin olive oil)\nHortopita (Organic Greens & Herbs)\nGreek Meze Plate (Tarama, Htipiti, and Tzatziki)\n-Entrees:\nShetland Island Organic Salmon (With steamed vegetables)\nShrimp Saganaki (Cous cous, tomato and feta)\nColorado Prime Lamb Chops (French fries & broccoli) - $10 extra\n-Desserts:\nGreek Yogurt\nKaridopita (With kaimaki ice cream)\n\nTomato Salad (4/5): I highly recommend this if you do like your tomatoes ripe, juicy, and red. I'm not a cheese person, but one of my friends kept bringing up about how delicious the feta cheese was. I would compare this salad to Olive Garden's... not comparable to the taste but the craving of wanting more after your plate is clean. If only this salad was refillable like Olive Garden's. This was probably my favorite out of the 3 appetizers.\n\nHortopita (3/5): If I can explain this in two words, it'd be Spinach Pie. It's a flaky pastry served with herbs inside. This appetizer was my least favorite. \n\nGreek Meze Plate (4/5): The 3 spreads on here were freshly made. This appetizer is personal preference on what spreads fit your palate. I ranked them #1 Htipiti, #2 Tarama, and #3 Tzatziki. It was my first time trying Htipiti (roasted red pepper and feta cheese) and Tarama (fish roe, olive oil, and lemon). I found the Tzatsiki less creamier here than the others I tried in other Mediterranean restaurants.\n\nShrimp Saganaki (3/5): Presentation was okay. I expected it to be different. This dish is served with 4 pieces of shrimp and cous cous. Nothing memorable with the shrimp. The tomato sauce was delicious! I would usually mix the tomato sauce and cous cous. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nShetland Island Organic Salmon: My friend ordered this. The salmon is huge, not sure if it was lunch-sized! It was cooked perfectly... probably one of the best I've tried. Besides the salmon, you get trunks of broccoli on your plate. \n\nColorado Prime Lamb Chop: My friend ordered this. Two lamb chops served with a bed of fries. I only tried a bite of the lamb chop, but my friend devoured this plate. Even though this plate comes with fries, I would alter them for something different if I was to order this.\n\nGreek Yogurt (4/5): I actually ended up liking this! Greek yogurt with raspberry sauce presented in a martini glass. If you are not sure about what greek yogurt tastes like, then think of tart flavor at your local frozen yogurt place! Very simple.\n\nKaridopita: I actually ordered this with another friend, but the waiter messed it up. Anyways, the walnut cake had a certain taste to it while the ice cream brought the sweet flavor to balance everything out. Moist and flavorful.\n\nMy friends and I left satisfied and happy. Once again, our waiters were great! Our waters never went below halfway, I believe. They were prompt and always around if we needed them. Their lunch is definitely something you should try out!"

There's a small bar area and an outdoor patio overlooking the Strip, in addition to the main dining area. Reservations are strongly recommended. \n\nThey do have a prix fixe menu, but they won't automatically give it to you. Our server's face literally fell and grimaced when we asked for the prix fixe menu. Prix fixe = you paying less for your meal. You get about half the portion with the prix fixe menu, but you pay half the price. And it's a great way to be able to experience more menu items. For dinner, it's under $50 a person for 3-courses. For an additional $35 you can add a wine pairing (wines by the glass are on the high-end of $$$ here). So we considered the prix fixe with wine pairing a pretty good deal. \n\nThere are two options for each prix fixe menu course, so we made sure to each order different items. Again, a great way to experience more of the menu. We had the crab cake, octopus, filet, fish, walnut pie, and baklava. We also ordered a side of tzatziki. \n\nI highly recommend getting the side of tzatiki. It's delicious and pairs well with the complimentary bread. The desserts were underwhelming and not worth it. The octopus was our favorite dish and quite delicious. Everything on that plate was wonderful. The crab cake was beautifully presented and tasty. The filet was good perfectly and very tender. The fish was also cooked perfectly, but lacked flavor. The octopus was really the greatest thing we ate here. Everything else was pretty forgettable.\n\nWhile we enjoyed our experience here, the food (at least what we had) wasn't worth the price. And our server basically snubbed us once we opted for the prix fixe. The tables next to us (who didn't ask for the prix fixe menu) had entirely different service than us. Not cool.\n\nLunch seems like the better option for this spot. I'd be willing to come back and try some other options. But more likely, I'll sit at the bar and have some octopus and tzatziki."

The birthday boy already warned us that it was going to be an expensive dinner, so I was prepared for that.  The waiter walked us to the fish and seafood display and explained each fish to us.  We ordered the crab legs and grilled octopus as appetizers.  The octopus was one of the best dishes I have ever had.  For dinner we had the milokopi baked in sea salt, grilled vegetables and the ribeye.  There was enough food for the six of us.  We also ordered the svigous and two chocolate sin desserts.  Most of the people in our group didn't like the svigous.  It wasn't bad, it was just unusual.  I loved the chocolate sin.  The service was excellent.  I love a well paced meal.  Because the fish is sea salt takes a bit longer to cook - it gave our group time to talk and celebrate.  Overall we loved the meal and the experience.  As a point of reference with drinks it came to $125 per person for a party of six."

Yes there were some Greek dishes on the menu but everything had a twist and wasn't really what we were expecting. It seems like the place just didn't have a real personality. The waiters didn't know too much about Greek food and drinks for when we asked if they had Retsina (we weren't planning to drink it) and out of curiosity why it was not on the menu they didn't even know what it was.\n\nIt was a Saturday night and I went with a friend. The wait service was the most annoying I have encountered in a long time. We were constantly bombarded with people talking about the food and drink menus, asking us if our food was good. Three or four separate people came to ask if our meal was fine. Two different people came to give us a desert menu and half way through dinner they insisted on giving us clean plates. It was absolutely the last thing from being a nice and relaxing meal.\n\nThe food was certainly good - albeit not authentic Greek. The prices were pretty steep even for Vegas - we paid $206+tax, for Octopus starter, $26, Tomato salad ($27) and 1 Lavraki (2.3lb - $123) and 2 glasses of Syrah ($30)\n\nOverall I wouldn't go back."

We were tired of the usual breakfast fare so we thought we would try something different.  \nGlad we did.\n\nThis restaurant has a very cool, modern feel to it.  High end looking but not snobby.  We each got the lunch special.  For appetizer I got the grilled octopus.  Gotta pay an extra $10 but well worth it.  Nice char to it and a surprisingly good portion with olive oil and seasonings.  The wife got the greek plate which consisted of a hummus, a tzatziki (did I spell that right?), and some kind of bell pepper spread with like 3 pieces of pita.  The wife loved it but again why only 3 pieces of pita?\n\nFor main course, I got the Lavraki which is a sea bass.  Nice and light with olive oil and lemon.  Just 3 bites in, the wife was eyeing my plate.  So we did the ol switcheroo.  That means I ended up eating her tuna burger.  While not a big fan of tuna burgers this one was actually pretty good.  Its not a seared tuna, its fully cooked but surprisingly not dry.  \n\nFor dessert, the wife got a yogurtini and I got the walnut cake.  The yogurtini was more like a yogurt parfait.  The walnut cake was nice and moist.\n\nI think that you cannot go wrong with the lunch special.  Since we sat near the kitchen I saw the lamb chops and lobster pasta going out and they both looked pretty tasty.  Next time, we may try the dinner menu.  Thumbs up from me."

The service was top notch and very attentive. I never once had to flag anyone down for water since they came around regularly to check on you. They were very accommodating, and allowed me to make a substitution to their prix fixe menu even though they don't normally allow that as stated on their menu.\n\nThe most memorable dishes my wife & I had include:\n\nChar grilled calamari which was perfect and well seasoned.\n\nThe meze plate with taramosalata, humus, & tzatziki is a must try. My favorite is the taramosalata. The cod or carp roe in it makes it an addictive spread.\n\nOf course we couldn't leave without having their famous lavraki sea bass with it's skin seared to perfection. Next time we'll try it baked with encrusted sea salt.\n\nWe stuck to the tried and true desserts of baklava and galaktoboureko. If I weren't so full, I would get another order.\n\nThe only thing I wanted to try, but didn't get a chance is their moussaka. Unfortunately I was already very full.\n\nI recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants authentic Greek comfort food for a moderate but fair price, with excellent service and fresh ingredients."

But, for a Vegas lunch with a few nonsensical items available for the courses...not so much. \n\nFirst and foremost, lunch, whether it be prix-fixe or not, should not take 2 hours to complete. Our server was very kind, but seemed a little confused by certain requests like extra tzatziki sauce. Maybe his confusion stems from the ocean-themed d\u00e9cor and fresh seafood on display when he's actually serving Mediterranean cuisine. But, I digress. \n\nThe food itself was...good; just that and nothing more. Certainly not my favorite Las Vegas or even Cosmopolitan dining option, and admittedly reflected in this review's low rating. The calamari was quite tasty, and the waiter was oddly a bit upset that we were too stuffed to finish the plate. Also, the lobster pasta comes with a moving (dead but still-moving) lobster on your plate with eyes still bulging, sadly staring back at you. I think my friend almost had a panic attack when it was placed in front of her. We love our lobster, but not when it's looking straight at you struggling to hang on to life. And yet, the bewilderment continued when she asked the bus boy to remove it off her plate. \n\nSo much confusion. Just...so much. Do yourself a favor and find lunch elsewhere."

The tables there are true dining tables and not your standard bar tables you might find in most restaurants.\n\nWe ordered crab cakes, wine, lobster (the spiny kind) and the fillet.  The lobster definitely wasn't worth the price (nearly $200 per lobster) but the steak was easily one of the best i've had in a while.  The wine was good and the crab cakes were fresh and fantastic.\n\nThe atmosphere at Milos and at the Cosmo are unparalleled.  It's easily the most \"upscale\" and trendy casino in all of Vegas.

The line caught thing, really who cares, and from what I've read it isn't better for the enviromnent if you care about that.  \n\nIf I was just rating their food I'd give it 5 glowing stars.  Food is better than any seafood place in town.  Service was 4 stars.  It was good, but could have been better.  The price point is the problem.  $50-100 a pound for seafood line caught wild seafood.   I get it, you have casino rent and wild caught fish is expensive.

It's a shame too, as my wife and I both enjoyed it.  \n\nIf you're on vacation and you love seafood and really don't care if you get over charged this a great place.

I ordered the tomato salad, the lamb chops (extra $10 but well worth it), and the yogurt dessert, and the person who came with me ordered the Meze platter, the sea bass, and the yogurt dessert. I actually preferred the Meze platter to the tomato salad -- I think it had to do with the fact that the tomatoes weren't quite a fresh, firm and juicy as they could have been if picked at peak tomato season (my favorite are tomatoes off the vine). That being said, it was certainly tasty, but the Meze platter was even better! Each of the three dips were very different, but so good! Both entrees were simply prepared, but delicious. The lamb was tender and flavorful, and the sea bass - served as a whole fish - was amazing! The dessert was simple but well executed! \nAmbiance-wise, it can come off a bit stuffy and stale. They have a white palate going on. However, we opted to sit outside. There's a lot of vegetation which creates a small oasis from the flashing lights from the rest of the Strip. \nI'm a huge fan and would love to come back when I'm next in Vegas."

Both times I've dined here the food was the highest freshest quality one could ask for, prepared immediately after you ordered it, cooked just right, and delivered cordially to your table. The quality of food is so pure & fresh you can order many different things and not feel heavy or weighed down, and feel nourished. I would recommend this place to anyone having a casual meal , a romantic date, a few appetizers, or drinks. The noise level is just right, slight conversation, the seating is very comfortable, the candle on the tables makes for a romantic dinner, the atmosphere & surrounding artistry/decor is inviting, comfortable, romantic, peaceful. Chef Rene went out of his way to accommodate us asking questions about what we desire to eat, type of seafood, preferences, and came to check on our table.

Every item was so amazing. From the way it looked to the way it tasted. She also did the wine pairing and they brought a different wine with each course.

Had the three course lunch for about $30 not including upgrades. Lobster pasta looked so amazing , but came out cold. Had to return it to be reheated, soooo disappointed and it costed an additional $15!! Flavor wise it was good but lacked boldness, too one dimensional . The crab cake , my friend raved about it, but for me it was good not great. I mean there was chunk of crabs but nothing special , had to pay an additional $10. Tried the whole fish , I'll pass - pretty dry . The lamb was new to the menu and boy the presentation sucks. On top of that it tasted blah, I'll pass. The milo special was good , basically fried zucchini with some kind of cream cheese spread. For Cocktail I would order the Sidecar and garden. One thing that made me piss was that they charged an additional $30 to make two drinks stronger . Dude I could have ordered two more drinks for that price!!!They didn't even tell us but the waiter was nice enough to waive it . \n\nBill came out to be about $100 a person :/"

As other yelpers have stated, the grilled octopus is excellent. I have to agree with them 100%. My wife and I think Milo's version is better than the one at Kokkari Estiatorio in SF. \n\nWe both enjoyed our main courses as well, my wife tried their house special Lavraki and I had the Nova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta (+$15).\n\nTheir bread was also fresh and paired well with their special olive oil, exclusive to Milos.

I've been here before and loved these two dishes. I wanted a nice glass of chardonnay preferably \nGreek. I tasted a few different wines and was not impressed at all. Maybe because they were Greek? Maybe I am too picky? I even tried a sauvignon blanc and it was awful. Anyhow I settled for a glass of whatever white and it was okay. The tzatziki wasn't bad but it tasted like I was eating pure sour cream. It was still tasty though. The octopus was still fabulous, so tender and loved the capers. The bartender let me try their bloody mary mix and it tasted pretty tangy and spicy...love love love! Full of flavor and definitely not plain jane out of the bottle mix. Now what kinda bothered me was the female bartender juicing limes and lemons at the huge juicing machine. Helloooo??? I want a peaceful quiet lunch and your prices aren't cheap people!!! That machine is loud and here she is grinding away with the limes like a little squirrel. Then these two guys sit further down the bar and order $30 shots of tequila \"chilled\" WHATTTT???!!!! The bartender goes and shakes the tequila up like it's from the gutter. I cringed. It's sipping tequila and you just ruined it. Please tell them!! Anyhow, then comes the young lady bartender with a big grey dirty looking cart with wheels on it and there is a huge load of ice in it. She proceeds to put the ice in the cooler. I'm assuming this ice is for customers drinks??? Ewwww.....This cart may have been clean but it looked all dirty with black marks in it.  You charge all that money for your food. You should have more class!! Also when I asked the bartender how to get to the Forum Shops, he didn't even give me a straight answer. A big ignore....thanks for helping me!"

My wife and I, along with four other friends, decided to dine at Estiatorio Milo's because we were staying at the Cosmopolitan hotel and it seemed convenient. What we discovered was a meal that was the classiest, freshest and tastiest we've had in a long time. \n\nNow let me just say that we consider ourselves Vegequarians (we eat seafood but no meat products) so we always look for fresh organic food whenever we eat out (not always easy to find).  We're way past having over prepared fattening sauces and fillers in our food, so finding a place that prepares great dishes that are both healthy and good for you are a top priority.  Milo's turned out to be one of the best places for Mediterranean faire we have ever enjoyed.\n\nWe arrived at Milo's fairly early (6:30 PM reservation) and our chef, Todd Smith, took us up to the raw seafood display and explained everything to us in as much detail as we wanted (where the fish came from, how fresh it was...the lobster on ice was still moving, and how he prepares it).  Already we were impressed and we had only just arrived. \n\nAlthough Todd and the restaurant started getting busier and busier, he paid so much attention to us at our table, we felt incredibly special. Once we had talked with Todd about all the food possibilities and made our decisions, our waiter, Rick Fisher took over and was masterful at taking care of all our needs.  \nWe started out with the first three Mediterranean dish appetizers of brilliantly created hummus, tazaki and vegetables prepared perfectly.  Although the dips were small portions they had so much flavor you didn't miss the usual large portions you often get in an ordinary Greek establishment.\n\nWe then had our meal (the Balada fish from Portugal was out of this world for us) and our guests a wonderful shrimp dish and prime rib that they said was fantastic. We were all too stuffed for dessert but Rick knew that one of our friends at the table was having a birthday and surprised her with a gorgeous piece of chocolate cake, flourless no less because he knew she only ate gluten free. \n\nOften a restaurant experience consists either of good food or good service, but rarely do you get to experience exceptional food along with exceptional service. Milo's is that kind of restaurant and we're already wondering how soon we can come back to Las Vegas just so we can experience this amazing restaurant again. \n\nThe only caveat is that Yelp lists this wonderful place as a $$$ restaurant.  That may be true for lunch, but it should be listed as a $$$$ for dinner, as we shared the food mostly family style, had drinks too, the meal averaged $80 per person.  Worth every penny!!!"

I would have paid $30+ just for it. Salmon pan-seared with the skin on, medium rare. Like butta. The best salmon I think I've ever had. That's saying a lot. I am normally reluctant to order salmon out...My wine was $18 but well worth it, just for a glass. It was the Greek Domaine Biblia Chora, Pangee. Sorry, don't remember the vintage. It was red. It was so lovely I couldn't stop smelling it. You know a wine is superior when you just want to make slow sweet love to it for over an hour, like I did. One glass was perfect though I will be looking for that exact wine at BevMo or what have you."

            "review": "I died and went to Greece last night via Las Vegas.  We really lucked out and our Table Chef was Greek, so we were able to speak and order in Greek.  We made reservations and I am so glad we did, the place was PACKED.  Not an empty spot anywhere, not even at the bar and this was on a Wednesday night.  We soon found out why, the food is the best Greek food we have ever had.  Everything was perfect.  I know you are asking what did the Greek order... first let me tell you my HUGE error was that we never looked at the menu and we ordered as we would normally do in Greece.  I should have known by our Table Chefs face that this was going to hurt because he smiled broadly and went into overdrive action.  He just realized he had big spenders on his hands and he was going to make it happen... NOTE: ask for a menu before ordering, this restaurant is NOT for people with shallow pockets.   I was told if you have dinner later in the evening they have a prix fix menu that is only $50 and is 3 courses.   Well on to the food....\n\nWe started with shots of ouzo, hey as far as I was concerned we were in Greece.  Then we were served fried zucchini with a tsatsiki center, they were PERFECT, if you have ever tasted perfectly fried zucchini you will understand what I mean.  They weren't too starchy from the flour, they weren't soaked in oil, they crunched in your mouth and they had tons of flavor... I want them again RIGHT NOW.  \n\nThen came the fried calamari, one word YUM, again perfect.  When the octopus was served, we all smiled.  You could smell the char on it, and you could see that perfect white interior meat when it's cooked the way it should be.  Then I took a bite, OH YEAH, it just melts in your mouth and you taste fresh octopus, the char from the coals, the lemon and everything all at once.  This appetizer disappeared first.\n\nWe were then served a tomato salad with sliced red onion, cucumbers, capers, kalamata olives and feta cheese.  In Greece this is called the Horiatiki Salata.  I swore last night that they flew the damn tomatoes in from Greece.  When in Greece I practically live on salad because the veggies are so fantastic, and this tomato salad was spot on.  Big crunchy flavor filled bites of tomato.  The dressing was traditional olive oil and red wine vinegar.  The grilled bread they had brought to the table sort of fell into the salad bowl and I was a good hostess and fished it out and ate it.  Holy sh** it was such a satisfying bite.\n\nThen came our fish, we ordered Lavraki (European sea bass) in a salt crust, baked in the oven.  This takes a little longer than grilling, but we were in Greece and on Greek time.  The fish is brought table side and in Russian service style the Table Chef removed the salt crust and then skinned, filleted and served us.  I miss this tradition and it was amazing to watch him work with such showmanship and dexterity.  He served the fish with Horta (wild greens) and beets with their greens in the center.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS... The fish was so moist, tasty and flaky.  I wish I could cook fish like this, I would eat it more often.\n\nWe did not order dessert, we were bursting at the seams.  I look forward to coming here again, but this time I am looking at prices, as much as I loved LOVED my tomato salad, I believe that $27 for it is just a little to pricey."

And if I was on an expense account or, as I assume from what I could observe of many of my fellow patrons when we were there, using my daddy's (or my sugar daddy's) credit card, a lavish, no holds barred dinner here would be a pleasant way to spend an evening without a care in the world,  Service that we had sitting at the bar was very professional, but I'm cutting them some slack for gently pushing the purchase of the restaurant's olive oil (a touch tacky, I think).\n\nThe problem is that the price of the dishes in the evening, given what you receive, is way out of line with the value.  Now,  I'd guess that many of my fellow patrons could give a flying fig about dollar value, but that's not how I roll.  I can justify dropping many hundreds of dollars for a meal for two on occasion if I was presented with dish after dish with double plus wow factor.  Here though, we're talking about relatively simple Mediterranean cuisine centered on Greek cooking.   I love that stuff big time, as it is the food that launched the cultures of the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the southern Spanish and French.  But no matter how much effort goes into sourcing the best or freshest this or that, at the end of the day you're dealing with a few ingredients cooked in a straightforward manner, maybe a couple of minutes on a grill, steamed to get just beyond raw, or pasta\\rice tossed in boiling water just long enough to still have a little tooth to it.  Simple food from a land that is relatively poor.\n\nThat's why I have to give Milos a 2 star based on our single visit just sampling the appetizer selections: this is simple food that is insanely expensive, albeit clearly involving good ingredients.  I can't give you exact prices (the menu on their website is outdated) but here is an example.  We ordered the grilled sardines.  This dish, a staple of the impoverished fishing villages of Portugal that involves simply brushing on a little olive oil and salt and tossing on a BBQ, was something like $22.  For that amount of money we received all of....four small sardines.  If the Greeks got over $5 for a fish the size of your index finger, they wouldn't be in a financial crisis right now.  The bottarga (grey mullet roe) was nearly $30, but turned out to be four tiny crackers with a sliver, and I mean a sliver, of cured roe.  The grilled octopus was very tasty, and the portion size we received was enough for two folks for sure, but at close to $30 the value simply wasn't there.  And perhaps the worst offender was the least expensive: the taramosalata was so bland and un-fish-like that we initially thought they had served us an order of hummus.  Even if it was under $10, and it certainly wasn't (maybe closer to $20), it wasn't worth what we had paid.\n\nI guess I'm just cranky though, because the place was packed with folks ordering the $300 grouper and thinking nothing about dropping $65 for a couple of lamb chops.  For me though, I'll save my money and spend it at a true Mediterranean restaurant that gives you decent bang for the buck.  \n\nNick in Palm Springs\n\nP.S.: How can a restaurant named \"Estiatorio Milos\" offer only a single variety of Ouzo?  The Greeks of the world would be outraged by this travesty!"

Perfect texture and seasoning.\n\nAs a main course I've tried both the salmon and chicken skewers. Both were pretty much perfect. The only small complaint is the broccoli served with the salmon was served whole which was annoying to manage, and it was under cooked by a bit.\n\nDessert I've only went with the fruits because yogurt and walnut cake aren't appealing to me, however if they are anything like everything else Milo's has to offer, they're probably amazing."

A few members of our party ordered the Prime Filet, which came with a side of fries.  Each person had requested their steak medium, and one of them came out well done (no pink what so ever).  It was pointed out to the waiter who offered to get another one.  After about 15 minutes the replacement was brought to the table sliced into 5 strips, which was quite odd, but no one complained as everyone else was near done with their meal.  The side fries for her dish didn't show up for another 5 minutes after the steak, which was similar to the others at the table (maybe this is how the side of fries is traditionally delivered at the restaurant?).  \n\nThose that got their accurate food order all really liked their dish.  The steaks had great flavor, the fries had a nice crispy texture, the salmon was a bit undercooked, but still decent.  One member of the party ordered the octopus and enjoyed it.\n\nIf it wasn't for the bad experience, the food might have got this restaurant 4 stars, but with the expense I would hope that people dont have this kind of experience and service."

It wouldn't of been a problem however the chef was yelling, sometimes swearing at all of the line cooks. This made for an extremely uncomfortable and stressful environment. I understood why he was mad, however he needs to pull it together. Not only both of our meals the meat was raw, but also the man next to us was served raw chicken as well. For any chef managing a kitchen that'd be unacceptable. Not to mention wasteful. We had ordered salmon and chicken kabob lunch plates. When they brought me a new salmon plate there were still pieces that were undercooked. My husbands chicken was completely raw. He didn't complain as we just wanted to get out of there. The saving grave was the management and our waiter. The manager listened and greatly apologized. She addressed the issue with the chef. She also comped one meal. Still, once you are served raw meat from one of your favorite restaurants the meal was ruined. I felt like we were in an episode of Hells Kitchen. I truly hope they pull the line cooks together. To serve 3 raw meats is unacceptable. It is not hard to cook chicken."

My mom got salmon bagel, chicken and Greek yogurt for dessert. \n\nEverything was really great. I was happy with our choices for the most part. The dips were great and the Greek yogurt blew my mind, it was so tasty. I had heard a lot about the walnut cake, but they don't offer that on the lunch menu anymore. \n\nFor lunch, this is the place to be and you could tell as they were very busy. Great deal and I can't wait to go back and hopefully try a few of the options that weren't available to us this time. Service was impeccable as well."

Bass for entree was really fresh and juicy, they gave you an entire fish with head, only thing I didn't like was there was bones that you have to watch for. Greek yogurt for dessert was not too sweet so it's alright. My cousin got the tomato salad, was pretty decent, grilled salmon was delicious! It was fresh, tender, and rich flavor. I would def come back and try more of their seafood!"

They have open table for reservation system so it was nice & easy to make reservations online for 4. We were greeted promptly when we walked in & taken to our table right away! They had fresh fish displayed on ice which I wish I got a closer look & some pictures... oh well.\n\nDecor of the place was gorgeous & was it not so darn hot outside we would have definitely sat out on the GORGEOUS garden style patio! The interior was clean... bright... simple yet had an elegant vibe. \n\nStaff looked clean cut & professional. Our first waitress that started us off was a girl yet we didn't get her name but it also seemed like it was a team taking care of us since our check was labeled team 4. There was another guy staff & he was just the comidian... he was clearing our plates & my phone was on the table as well & I was watching him clear my plates as he was talking to me & he grabbed my phone so smoothly as if it were a dirty dish & he had the biggest smile & I was like \"wait what just happened\" hahahaa I LOVED it. Definitely made the dining experience more comfortable & pleasurable.\n\nWe all got the Lunch Prix fix menu which came w/ an appetizer, entrees, & dessert along w/ complimentary warm bread w/ a fresh opened bottle of Olive Oil called the MY SISTER'S EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil ahahahaha. All of this for $25.15 per person\n\n\n** Appetizers **\nGREEK MEZE PLATE - Tarama which seemed to be like a hummus was smooth & velvety w/ a kick of garlic which we also dipped into it w/ fresh hot flat bread. Tatziki was so refreshing & light from the cucumbers. Hortopita was like a baklavak but filled w/ greens of some sort & cheese & the Manouri cheese seemed like it was just made! This dish was also served w/ pieces of Salami, Kalamata olives, & Cherry tomato. We got 2 orders of these & licked the plate clean!\n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS +$10 - this was a sashimi grade Mediterranean octopus that was charcol-broiled... boy did it just melt in your mouth w/ a little smoky finish & a kiss of olive oil! \n\nFRESH MARYLAND LUMP CRAB CAKE +$10 - 1 I would say about 3oz. Piece of crab cake served w/ marinated navy beans (looked like gigantic white bean) & mustard emulsion which I thought was not necessary as the crab cake alone was delicious & no fillers just pure crab meat which is always appreciated.\n\n\n** Main Course **\nLAVRAKI - mediterranean sea bass cooked to a perfect medium so that it just melts away in your mouth served w/ large broccoli & a grilled half lemon for extra citrus.\n\nSHETLAND ORGANIC SALMON - man was this the BIGGEST JUCIEST piece of salmon I have seen... I personally don't like salmon but this one was not too bad & didn't have too much of fishy flavor that salmon normally has. Also served w/ broccoli & a grilled half lemon.\n\nNOVA SCOTIA DEEP SEA LOBSTER PASTA +$15 - this was my dish & it came w/ the WHOLE lobster which I LOVE because my FAVORITE part of any seafood is the head.... (I know I'm weird but I feel the head has the MOST yummy flavors) in my case I got lucky & scored on a female w/ eggs!! =] ANYWAYS the pasta was tossed in a light tomato sauce w/ chuncks of lobster tail meat & the sauce had a TINY hint of spice which was AWSOME!! but *note* the pasta should really be finished at the resteraunt because I packed the rest & it didn't taste as delicious but I was so full!!\n\n\n** Dessert **\nTHE REAL GREEK YOGURT - WOW OMG O LAAWDY LAAWDY! we got our w/ simply honey which I think the big sis said that they make themselves... but the Greek yogurt they make fresh everyday & it was just like right below ice cream thickness & so smooth yet slight tartness just dunno how they do it... would definitely get FIRED here if I ever worked here LOL =]"

Some of our group was starving so we made our way up to the third floor where we put in our name for a table at STK. The place was a mad house and we were ready to sit and eat so we chose instead to head to Estiatorio Milos directly next door. The fact that I have taken meat out of my diet made this a more favorable choice anyhow.\n\nOur party of 8 was seated at a large table within minutes of walking in the door. A number of us promptly walked over to the kitchen where a selection of fish was on ice. A waiter walked us through the different fish options and before we knew it, we had chosen a large red snapper. \n\nThen we headed back to the table where we ordered a large selection of appetizers including the grilled octopus, 12 jumbo shrimp, calamari, and a beefsteak tomato & onion salad. .As we waited both bread as well as flatbread were delivered to the table. This reminded us we needed hummus as had their spread selection sent out.\n\nThe food started arriving and we all dug in; including the group that had already eaten. The grilled octopus was to die for, and the beefsteak and onion salad was a perfect blend; not overwhelming on the onion as many of those salads can be. The jumbo shrimp were sweet and meaty; cooked with a blend of mouthwatering spices. The calamari, well, it was calamari- nothing too exciting there. \n\nThe chef sent out a few complimentary plates to the table that included a spicy tuna tartar and sashimi as well as a tower of fried zucchini & eggplant (probably my least favorite item I had that evening). And, throughout the entire meal, I couldn't stop eating the flatbread and hummus! All of that food disappeared quickly with everyone at the table absolutely thrilled with the food we had thus far eaten. When I say all, I mean we ate EVERYTHING!\n\nAnd then the snapper came. For some reason I had come to the conclusion they had forgotten about it, but the waitress explained that it takes about 10 minutes per pound to cook. Now, I am not a huge cooked fish fan because I can't handle even the slightest of fishy tastes. This fish was so mild and cooked so tender and amazing; I caught one of my friends stealing some off my plate as well as his girlfriends!\n\nOn top of it all, the service we received was extremely attentive. I completely look forward to frequenting this restaurant more in the future!"

I've had fish just as good many times for 1/4th the price.\n\nmy one wish is that we'd known how much we were ordering as we barely got to half of it and still spent over $250 with tax and tip! Order less, you can always add more if hungry! Prepare to drop $125+ per person for a glass of wine + basic food."

Two of the three had a $10.00 up charge but they were all delicious and worth the extra money.

Lastly I had the Greek Yogurt which ended my fabulous meal. \n\nMy clients were just as pleased with their meals as myself and everyone was satisfied.

It felt bipolar, and as a result my review is middle of the road. \n\nTheir cocktails were solid to start. The Cucumber Cooler tasted like a beachside sunset. Our server picked a great bottle of white wine that paired well with every dish, even though the dishes weren't that great. More on that later. \n\nAs a restaurant focused on seafood, its selection was out of this world. Fresh fish flown in from the Mediterranean on shelves of ice and tanks full of shellfish. We spent almost 10 minutes trying to decide which fresh fish to pick, then determine if steamed or grilled was the preferred method of cooking. The steamed sea bass we ended with was perfectly flavoured with lemon, salt, and probably the most memorable fish I've eaten this year. \n\nThe underwhelming part? All the staple Greek items were slightly off. \n\nWe had grilled octopus, which is difficult to prepare. It wasn't as rubbery as one would expect at a chain, but definitely not super tender, especially if it was presumably fresh. As for the highly recommended fried zucchini, eggplant and saganaki on a skewer, something so classic and traditional, turned out to be tame. To top it off, the baklava was too sweet and crunchy. I could get something better in any other Greektown in North America.\n\nOur server was maybe the most consistent part of our dining experience. He winced if we were about to order something sub-par, and silently steered us away from fish that wasn't the freshest. The amount of detail he put into presenting the dish and enthusiasm for the ingredients is what ultimately made our meal!"

I expected better pita like the pillowy airy pita at Zatinya.  The lamb chop was succulent and simply seasoned.  I had a taste and it wasn't too gamey.  The dorada was grilled until flaky and tender.  It was served whole, but deboned.  Octopus was excellent.  It was tangy, smoky, and with a slight bite to it.  The serving size was also generous considering octopus shrinks quite a bit after cooking.  Crab cake was jumbo lump and tasted very fresh, however, the serving size looked smaller than the pictures on yelp.  We finished with rich and creamy real Greek yogurt served with cherry compote and the honey soaked walnut cake.  The service was attentive and our water glasses were filled several times.  \n\nThe only problem here was the annoying and repetitive upsell by the server.  We got 3 supplements (octopus, lamb chop, and crab cake) and the guy still tried to sell us additional items.  I picked dorada as my entree and the server tried to get me to order some potato side and said it will be like fish and chips.  This is a lightly grilled fish, its not at all like fish and chips.  Nice try dude.  After we finish ordering, he informed us that our appetizers will take a while, and try to sell us one more appetizer so we can munch on something before our other appetizers arrive.  Really?  Of course, we had to listen to the whole speech on all of our neighboring tables too."

Indeed, they have upped the price, but I don't think $2 is much more for what you are getting. However, if they upped the price anymore than that I would think twice about coming here for this particular Pre=Fixe.\n\nI believe one of the best ways to eat well, in fancy places, and get the bang for your buck is to eat happy hours, lunch, and Pre-Fixe menus. Numerous fancy-dancy places in Vegas offer these menus in their \"off\" times (IE: not dinner) and this accommodates especially locals very well. I imagine the meal I had at this particular lunch would have set me back a whole lot more than 20 bucks-ish had I been dining during a \"dinner\" time at Milos. With that being said, onto the food:\n\nFirst Course - Meze Plate\nComes with three sauce, pita bread, cheese, one tomato and one olive. I really wanted another kalamata olive. Why just one Milos?! Why?! Oh right, presentation or something probably. I chose the meze plate because I wanted an option to just get my palate going before I had my main course. The other first courses on the menu are quite sumptuous (scallops, octopus, etc.) However, the meze plate eases you into your meal in a nice way, being able to play with which flavors you slather onto your pita bread. I enjoyed the dish and the presentation.\n\nSecond Course - Sea Bass\nA fish you'll wish you could eat every time you eat fish. It is presented sliced in half, tail and head still attached (please do what you can to scrape some meat out of the head - I did!). The flavor is - buttery, meaty white fish. If you don't know what that tastes like, then order this dish and enjoy. My fish did not have too many bones, I believe I probably ran into about 5-6. However, my friend's fish seemed to be loaded, so just be careful when eating.\n\nThird Course - Walnut Cake\nMeh. I was not impressed and wished I had ordered another dessert. This cake was dry and tasted like gingerbread. I'm not a fan. The ice cream on top was the only reason I could stomach the whole piece. Had the ice cream not been on top I would have just left it on the plate after the first couple bites.\n\nService - Genteel, warm, friendly, upscale, quick, we were not forgotten, nor were we hovered over. When we arrived the place was empty, when we left it was totally full. So kudos to management and servers for keeping a service exceptional through a lunch rush.\n\nOverall - A decent Pre-Fixe to try out. Since Milos specializes in seafood, those who may not want to dump a whole lot of money into such a specialized restaurant should consider the Pre-Fixe option and then decide whether or not they would return for full price. Now, if I had a hankering for seafood and had some extra money to throw around I would definitely return to Milos, probably with out-of-town friends to wow them."

I started with the scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=-9QrumuAjE-fOMgZMwpFUA) with a citrus and mint salad. This was the most disappointing part of the meal. Two tiny scallops, each barely larger than bay scallops. I wish there was more of a char on it. Also, one mint leaf, several shreds of onion, and one orange segment not a salad make. My friend had the grilled octopus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=n4dgEIUOiLVuL7VgnA-yzA) and if I can recommend one thing here, pay the extra $10 for the octopus. It's worth it. You get well seasoned octopus with great char from the grill     \n\nI had the grilled Mediterranean Bass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=ZHxqPjGi3u3VHfB-WvHMWA) as my entree and it was the epitome of what I love about  Greek seafood dishes - the olive oil, capers, and lemons... so simple but so delicious. The fish is served whole so there will be some bones but it was a very well-prepared fish. My friend had the lamb chop (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=JPMx_KuND2Sb_T6rO6JNCw) and he said it was decent. I guess this is a signal to stick with seafood here. \n\nI had the yogurt martini (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=FjlBOb4mUpo-ux8CTfcxbg) to round of the meal and I liked it. The yoghurt was just the right amount of sweet counterbalanced by natural tanginess. Nice light desert to cap a meal. My friend had the walnut pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=yNpyFpainXX8wHBr--EasA) and it's decent. If you like deserts with some spice in it then you'll probably like this one. \n\nAll in all we had a good meal at Estiatorio Milos. It's a bright and airy restaurant with lots of natural light. Our Japanese server took good care of us and for the most part, we enjoyed our food. But again, the lunch special is truly a good deal so definitely pencil it in if you're in town."

My favorite places to dine are the Aria and Cosmopolitan. The Milos restaurant was so incredible. First of all, it is a little bit unconventional. When you sit down somebody will come over and walk you through the fishmarket. He or she will explain everything that they have, how fresh it is, the process of how they cook it even down to the seasoning they use. Everything is meant to share. I went with my fianc\u00e9 and his parents so there were four of us and getting one piece of meat was perfect. However you definitely want to take advantage of the appetizers as well. They do serve bread-and-butter which is delicious and I highly recommend getting cocktails as well. The service is outstanding, if you get there early enough or make a reservation definitely asked to be seated near the window for a much better ambience. The dress is dressy casual. I didn't realize how dressy this place was and I felt a little under dressed. For the desert as well. However, this is another save your pennies sort of deal. Our bill was definitely over $400 so make sure you ask when you choose your meat selection how much it will be. Enjoy!"

What a wonderful surprise at the elegant, organic Greek atmosphere and I fell in Love with the private Wine Room dinning area- so intimate and wonderful! Alex was my server and he was gracious enough to go over the whole menu with me and I am so pleased I took his recommendations! Gina is the Manager and she is so pleasant and helpful! Even if I weren't having a corporate party here, I would still dine here!  Although, I am so happy we will be hosting our party here- quite the impression it'll leave on our clients!"

Super fresh, its all on display where you can go look at all the fish and pick what you want. the Charred octopus was my favorite, I love octopus but I'm very picky about it and this was the best I've ever had. Super clean and simple. I love that I could taste the fish and not just salt and seasoning which most places overdo on grilled fish. Service was fantastic, super friendly and very knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients of the food. I love to know how things are made. Fantastic drinks and they constantly give you new silverware, plates, and clean up crumbs. Two Thumbs up"

Be careful because they tack on a extra $10 for premium items like crab and stuff, but the portions are soooooo tiny because it is a upscale, fine dining restaurant.

The octopus was grilled to perfection, incredibly tender, meaty, and smoky.  \n\nDon't bother with the Salmon.  It's not bad but it pales in comparison to the Lavraki (european sea bass, loup de mer, branzino).  The Lavraki was sweet and perfectly seasoned with olive oil, salt and capers.  The lamb chops were also very good if you're not into fish.\n\nAmazing."

How is it that I've been to Marquee so many times and never noticed this amazing restaurant tucked in the corner across from Secret Pizza?! If you want a fantastic lunch with the Vegas ambiance on a budget, Milos is the spot. My review is purely based on my spectacular lunch experience which I hope I will get to experience again and again on future trips to Vegas.\n\nFor $22.14 you can get a delicious and very worthy 3 course lunch special. There are some plates with additional costs so your lunch can add up quickly. I ordered a fresh squeezed grapefruit juice to drink which was delish.\n\nFor appetizers, the greek meze plate was delicious. All three spreads were so good, I even got extra pita bread to eat it up. The lavraki grilled mediterranean sea bass was fresh, light and perfectly cooked. But surprisingly, my FAVORITE was the greek yogurt dessert. It's served in a martini glass, made with a bit of added powdered sugar for the perfect sweetness, drizzled with strawberry puree... it's absolutely DIVINE. I wanted to lick that martini glass clean. I thought I had already had life changing imported greek yogurt (at Go Greek Yogurt in Beverly Hills) but they make their yogurt in house and it's the best greek yogurt I've ever had in my entire life. I definitely wanted to get another one haha. DON'T skip the greek yogurt, you'd be missing out.\n\nThe restaurant is chic, bright and spacious. Lots of table seating and you can order full menu at the bar. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. I can't believe they serve lunch everyday, I'm excited to come back and try the rest of the menu including their popular fried zucchini/eggplant dish!"

It offers lunch menu with 3 courses for $20.12 from Monday through Sunday. You can chose one from 6 different appetizers, 6 different main courses, and 3 options of deserts. I came here with my mom for Sunday lunch, and got seated at terrace. Atmosphere at terrace was very relaxing with stylish ambiance. My first course was fresh diver scallop skewer. Scallop tasted very fresh. It was cooked perfectly with right amount of seasoning. I could still taste sweetness of fresh scallops from my dish.  I had grilled Mediterranean bass as my main course. It was absolutely delicious!!! Fish meat tasted very elegant. Chef removed all the fish bones during preparations, so I could enjoy my dish with no worries. Bass was grilled beautifully with little seasoning of olive oil and sea salt. Is was simple and just perfect. I had walnut cake as desert. It was light and not too sweet. Overall I had a great time here, and would definitely be back very soon with friends and family. Milos truly won 5 starts on my yelp book. It is truly worthy every penny I spent here.

While they didn't have room inside, I was pleased that they were able to seat us promptly on the terrace. Unfortunately, they should have warned us that the terrace was hot enough to bake the fish on, had no ventilation, and is situated opposite an unobstructed 10 story tall strobing LCD screen -- epileptics need be warned. Throughout the entire meal, we constantly needed to wave down servers for water and drinks -- which was odd considering the overwhelming need for hydration. When it was time to chose our entree's, our waiter walked us to preview the available fish and gave us a succinct review of each one. Fun! Unfortunately, he never asked us to reserve one and when we finally got around to ordering he said that the specific fish we wanted was spoken for : \\  We ended up ordering  a half-dozen oysters, two fish,and a $70 new york strip for the table. When it arrived, the fish was divided and plated for us in unequal portions, the expensive NY strip was served well done after ordering it med rare, and the fish was very no-frills. I got the impression that they're trying to make good ingredients stand out by serving it without any embellishments, but when the bottom of the fish is overcooked and you're chewing bits of carbonized bone, the fish doesn't speak well for itself. \n\nWith so many good buffets in Vegas it's easy to get tasty and flavorful food with mediocre service. But when one decides to sit down for dinner at a restaurant a certain experience is desired. My guests and I did not walk away with either memorable food or attentive service and spent a few hundred dollars extra for it."

A snotty Attitude might make it in Las Vegas, and impress the tourists who mistake it for class, but 28 bucks for a greek salad is indefensible on any level.

Do yourself a favor and go to crete, find out what wonderful service is found in every single eating establishment on that lovely island, and the next time you come to Milos, you'll walk out in disgust as we did.\n\nI suspect the great reviews on here are either (1) not actual human beings paying for food, and (2) unaccustomed to quality service.

I had eaten at the New York location years ago and remember excellent food and service. We arrived promptly for our 8:30 reservation and were told that our table was in the process of being set up.  Fifteen minutes later, we had not yet been called and were ignored when we approached the hostess stand. At 9:00 we were again told that our table was being set up. We should have left at this point. Numerous other patrons were also complaining about being seated late for their reservations. Finally, at 9:30, we were shown to our table, without the slightest apology. Someone promptly brought bread to the table, but we didn't even get water or menus until we asked for them over 5 minutes later. This was the trend for the whole dinner. The service was a total disaster. Our order was messed up, the food took an eternity and our glasses were often empty. Our whole fish and sides were very good, but certainly not worth the hefty price tag.  French fries were $15 an order (we needed 3 orders for our table), a Greek tomato salad was $27 and TINY!!! The tuna was a good cut and fresh, but very bland. Dinner and drinks ended up being about $100 per person. Three and a half hours later, we were finished and left with a bad taste in our mouths. No one seemed to be at all concerned about our bad experience in the restaurant."

There's no vegetarian option for the entree so if you're vegetarian you're going to have to order off the a la carte menu(note this menu is more expensive). My boyfriend got the 3 course menu and picked the tomato salad which was a salad containing tomatoes, olives, onions and this amazing feta. For his entree he got the whole fish which comes deboned and for dessert he got the Greek yogurt which was light and tasty. I never eat tomatoes because I dislike them but I really enjoyed the tomato salad my boyfriend got. The bread they serve is also really good. For my meal, I got the grilled vegetable plate which came with eggplants, squash, zucchini, onions, fennel, cheese and yogurt. It was $31 but it was sooooo delicious. I may order it again if I'm really craving it but $31 for veggies is kind of crazy.

Last night however it was a different story. We ate on a Sunday night so the menu was limited and the main attraction was the fresh fish display. \n\nWe shared the Milos special starter of fired zucchini and it was lovely. We chose a small Branzino fish for main with Greek salad and potato sides. The sides were yummy but it's pretty hard to mess up a salad and potatoes so no surprise there. This fish was super disappointing. Not nearly fresh enough so not as delicious as it appeared. \n\nThe bigger shock was the bill. To be honest we were moronic in not asking about the pricing of the fresh fish on display but it still came as an almighty fright. I expected it to be an expensive meal but I didn't expect to pay six times the average market price for a fish! \n\nI guess the moral of this review is know what your are going to be paying - ask for the price before they gut and cook it - and make sure its fresh that day for the price you'e paying."

I don't think you really need to make a reservation because it seems pretty spacious and lot of seatings. \n\nI picked the scallop, Mediterranean bass, and fresh fruits. I want to mention that you can add $10 to add change appetizer to the octopus and + $10 ?  to lamb chops and $15 to entrees to make it the lobster pasta. \n\nThe bread was pretty good as it comes with olive oil. \n\nThe scallop was simply wonderful as it was cooked in perfection and seasoned well. It comes with onions and peppers which made a really great harmony as you bite through the stick. I had two bites of the octopus(which they recommend) which was really good too. The waiter to describe the octopus to be as tender as a pork chop kind of thing(I think that's what he said). Regardless it was really delicious and it wasn't super chewy. Simply wonderful\n\nThe Mediterranean bass made me really think about how amazing it is that it only cost FREAKING $22.13! You're seriously getting what you are paid for. The bass was light hearted and the waiter to tells us to eat from the tail to the head and as you go up to the fish head, there will  be bones. It was a really light dish with a really nice and citrus and acidity sauce that was on the bottom of the bass. The bass was cooked well and it wasn't overcooked and dried up. Definitely a recommendation to get. \n\nI had a small bite of the lamb chops(I don't like lamb) and it was ACTUALLY VERY GOOD. It didn't have that lamb taste which was why I liked it a lot! If you got me liking your lamb dish, you are one heck of a restaurant. BUT MAN THAT $15 to add the lobster pasta was just WOOOO. They give you the whole lobster...which the head and tail is divided and the pasta is in the middle. It was like a lobster tomato spaghetti  that a wonderful tomato sauce to along with it. THe lobster was super fresh and I say it was definitely a winning dish. \n\nDEFINITELY AND DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HERE AS IT IS TOTALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY AT LUNCH!\n$22.13!!! LIKE ER MER GEWD"

The portions are just right and they have great selections.\n\nFor appetizer they have: Greek Meze Plate (tarama, tzatziki and htipiti), Canadian Classic (smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onion and a bagel), Scallop Skewer (with green bell pepper and couscous), Tomato Salad, Grilled Octopus for an extra $10 or Crab Cake for an extra $10.  \n\nFor entree: Lavraki (grilled bass), Salmon (with steamed veggies), Organic Chicken Breast Skewer (with grilled mushrooms, onions and pita), Shrimp Saganaki (with couscous, tomato and feta), Lamb Chops (with fries and broccoli) for an extra $10 or Losbter Pasta for an extra $15.\n\nFor dessert: Walnut Cake (with Kaimaki ice cream), Yogurt Martini or Fresh fruits.\n\nGreek Meze Plate:\nI started dipping my pita from the most flavorful to the not-so-much. I was not in the mood for flavor elevation today.  The tarama (creamy fish roe paste), bursts with pleasant brinyness, reminded me of  eating pregnant sardines but creamier (pardon the Andrew Zimmern-esque description).  It was very smooth and you can't tell you're eating fish eggs.  Dip your pita in the htipiti (red pepper spread) next.  Huge flavor difference from the tarama. Then move onto the tzatziki for a cool, tangy, creamy dip. Repeat.  Your plate comes with feta, olive and grape tomatoes too. 5/5\n\nGrilled Octopus: \nHands down, THE BEST octopus I've had in the past 2 years.  It was tender and had an excellent smoky flavor to it.  It was absolutely wonderful. 5/5\n\nLavraki:\nServed head on.  Grilled sea bass drizzled with olive oil, capers and served with broccoli.  The skin got soggy except for the part closest to the tail which was crisp and flavorful.  They'll warn you about the fish collar being too boney. 4/5\n\nLobster Pasta:\nGreat presentation. Lobster head, pasta, and lobster tail on a plate. Huge chunks of lobster in the pasta in a light tomato sauce.  What a beautiful dish. 5/5\n\nWalnut Cake:\nA small slice of what tasted like a banana bread except less moist. The ice cream tasted similar to absinthe/anise which I personally don't like. 3.5/5\n\nYogurt Martini:\nGreek yogurt in a martini glass topped with strawberry sauce and half a strawberry for garnish. There's nothing more to elaborate on this one. 3.5/5\n\nService and location were superb.  There's nothing bad to say about this place at all."

Lunch is served pre fixe for $25. 1st course I upgraded to the grilled octopus for $10 extra, and it was worth it. They seasoned it and grilled it perfectly. The bread they serve with olive oil is also worth a half slice. 2nd course I ordered the salmon, which is served with 3 pieces of broccoli. Broccoli was amazing, and the salmon was cooked perfectly, but I found it a little oversalted and slightly on the oily side. If you don't like capers, be sure to let them know, because they were all over the fish and octopus plate. 3rd course I ordered the Greek yogurt that is served with raspberry sauce- it is to die for!!! Best healthy dessert I've enjoyed. If you have somewhere to be, this isn't the place for you. Full service takes an hour with one person, so I imagine a group would be much longer. I definitely plan to go back though."

Only drawback was very hard to locate, I work my thigh highs and ouch! It was worth it once I had the food! Go to Milos now! Again the service was excellent! I love it when they are there for you but not over doing it, silent service is the best. If I want to know things about a server or dishes or random trivial fluff, I will ask or google. Other Vegas restaurants please take notes! Milos knows what they are doing! Oh, and the food is the best I have had in a long time!"

            "review": "It's Greek To Me!\n\nEstiatorio Milos is an upper-scale, Greek restaurant located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. It specializes in serving authentic, Greek-Mediterranean cuisine featuring fresh fish flown in daily, straight from the Mediterranean.\u00a0Everything on the menu is quite pricey, a la carte & allegedly big enough for sharing,\u00a0but I didn't think the side dishes were overly big.\u00a0\n\nThe Grilled Octopus app was $26 & is sushi-grade Mediterranean octopus, char-grilled w/capers & lemon aioli. I'm not overly crazy about octopus, but it had a nice taste & texture, not too tough & was really fresh/tangy, 4 gems!\u00a0\n\nMy side of Holland peppers consisted of grilled red, yellow & orange peppers marinated in olive oil & aged balsamic. These peppers were really good, but you don't get a lot for $18.\u00a0\n\nAt Milos, they have a\u00a0fresh fish market inside the restaurant where you can pick out your own fresh fish, but I wasn't in the mood for perusing & deferred to the server's recommendation of the whole, grilled Mediterranean Lavraki aka Greek Sea Bass, one of the featured fresh market fish of the day flown in fresh from\nthe Mediterranean. \n\nThe fish was brought out on a cart after it was grilled & the server carved & split it table side.\u00a0The fish was very fresh, light/delicate\u00a0and was simply accented with capers, fresh lemon, parsley & a touch of olive oil. It was a great tasting flavor combo! This is a gemtastic fish\u00a0choice if you don't mind spending market price, $150 which would buy you about 4 trips to the bottomless Bellagio Breakfast/Brunch Buffet! \n\nFor dessert, I only wanted the honey ice cream without the works. So for $9, I got a few small balls of honey ice cream. It was good, kinda like vanilla with a slight honey-taste not too over-whelming, but not sure it was $9 good.\u00a0\n\nOne cool thing worth mentioning if you are a martini drinker like me, they serve feta-stuffed olives in place of blue-cheese stuffed olives, which was a nice change up in my Ciroc Vodka on the rocks.\u00a0\n\nThe ambience at Milos is white table cloths and dressy. Some Vegas big whig next to me was having his bday meal, and the manager was obnoxiously gushing all over him. However, I thought he must not be that big of a whig or they would not have seated him next to me, plus I had no reservation lol!\n\nDespite the hefty bill & really good food (albeit not a whole lot of food) I left Milos, surprisingly still hungry. If you want a really nice, pricey, authentic Greek dining experience, go to Milos. If you want a really great, quasi-Greek dining experience where you get more bang for your buck, is easier on the wallet but hell on your diet, wait & go to The Greek Islands in Chicago, IL. \n\nThat being said, the service was friendly & efficient at Milos. Also, kudos to the hostess who correctly won on her 1st try \"Guess the Kinda Asian\" game that everyone I encounter feels compelled to play with me (but so few ever win), thereby sparing me from the awkward/annoying subsequent guesses & her a snarky retort from yours truly!\n\nI highly recommend giving Milos a shot if you want a very nice, authentic Greek meal while stayin' or playin' at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. It was a really gemlicious $275 appetizer...Thank God for Secret Pizza later!!"

I was very disappointed in just about every dish.\n\nFirst off, we received the calamari. It came even before the bread.. That seemed strange, but anyway it was ok. Nothing to write home about. I've had better ones for a third of the price.\n\nNext came the bread. Good crusty bread with a side of olive oil.\n\nNext we got the Milo's special. One was pretty good. Flavorful tzatziki with nicely fired zucchini. The other order was salted HEAVILY. It was barely edible.\n\nAfter that, we received the famous octopus. Everybody rants and raves about this octopus. It was chewy. I was so let down. I was expecting tender pieces of octopus.. Chewy.. Sad..\n\nLastly, we ordered two kinds of fish, however it didn't matter which you are wondering about.. Both were disgustingly DRY. It felt like I was eating sandpaper. A place known for its seafood, with a fish as it's logo.. I would expect they know how to make fish.. Overall horrible meal, good service. I will not be back."

Grilled veggie platter with tatziki was super tasty as were the fresh oysters and fried cheese. For our main course, our waiter presented us with a wide range of fresh fish to choose and pick out firsthand. The lobster pasta we selected was exceptionally presented and tasted terrific.  The branzino was even better, perfectly grilled and seasoned. The fish was rich in taste, and prepared to perfection. Ambiance and service are on point.

We were also told this wasn't a problem.  This was true, as 50% of the items on the menu were acceptable for her.\n\nI did the scallops, Lavraki, and yogurt martini.  She did the tomato salad, some kind of chicken, and the yogurt martini.\n\nbest meal i've had in my 6 trips to Vegas.\n\nIt started off a little rough with the appetizers, I thought.  I'm accustomed to moderate portions when ordering food, so when I got two scallops for my app, I didn't know what to think.  Gf was almost pissed!  BUT... the quality of two of these scallops surpassed 20 from a place like Red Lobster.  it actually got me to savor the flavor.  \n\nGf told me her tomato salad was the best kind of salad she's ever had.  All ingredients were incredibly fresh.  She now has a desire to make this at home.\n\nWe did have an issue with the main course.  We requested her chicken be served without the pita, and the waiter did indeed write this on the order, but the chef put the chicken on top of it anyway.  She was going to let it go, but the waiter said it wasn't an issue at all for them to do another plate.  Since we were on vacation, I told her not to take a chance of poisoning herself, and to get another plate.  It took a while for her new plate, but this just shows that everything was cooked fresh, again. \n\nMy Lavraki was great.\n\nFor dessert:  best yogurt i've ever tasted.  So, so rich, but we were drawn in to eat it all.\n\nThe manager came by after we were finished and asked how it was.  He encouraged us to write a review (already planned on it, as I told him:)  ) on here and anywhere else the restaurant was listed.\n\nDespite the gluten incident, it's a legit 5 star dine.  Simple mistake that they took care of, and everything was of high quality.  Will look forward to dining here again in the future.\n\nbtw... just read the review about the yogurt being 5 bites???  it took me about 20."

He was asking the other kitchen person after telling us that is more buttery but he doesn't kniw the name-you dont know the name of the fish that costs almost $100 ok so we chose our fish and  waited for one hour.if the fish was good I would not mind but honestly it wasn't.

I had always passed by this restaurant to and from \"the\" pizza place, but it was time for a little more sophisticated dining this time around.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in here, it just felt a bit odd. I can't quite put my finger on it. From the beginning to the end, the service just seemed to slow down dramatically. Our waiter was a bit older, and he seemed awfully rough around the edges, so to speak. With the way he spoke and interacted with us, it just seemed like he was inconvenienced to serve us.\n\nAnyway, on to the food. I heard about the awesome scallop appetizer on here, but sadly they were all out. It was barely noon on a Saturday. If you wanted the grilled octopus or crab cake appetizers, they were an additional $10. I tried some of my wife's and they were excellent. Nice and tender, with a tasty grilled flavor. I had the smoked salmon and it was okay on its own. Paired with their hot-off-the-oven pita, it was fantastic. Be sure to ask for their pita bread.\n\nFor the main entree, I had the lavraki, which is sea bass. It was on the smaller side, but incredibly tender, moist, and flaky. For dessert, I had the walnut cake. It was an abysmal dessert. Not only did we wait forever for it to arrive (we watched other tables who arrived after us receive their desserts first), but the cake was bland. \n\nOverall, there were some hits and misses with the food. I just felt like even with the prix fix menu, the food is still incredibly overpriced. I know Greek cuisine is supposed to be light and simple, using ingredients like olive oil and herbs. However, I just felt like there needed to be more creativity, more passion, and more style with their food. This is Vegas, and you have to kick it up a notch to survive and keep up with everyone else."

I finally had a perfect opportunity to hit the Strip on my days off, thanks to some friends visiting Las Vegas recently.\n\nI knew Estiatorio Milos would be the perfect spot to go and enjoy the best value and possibly the best tasting lunch special available on our very famous Las Vegas Strip.  And we were not disappointed.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly emptied when I walked in just after 2pm on a Tuesday on my first visit.  But the service we recieved from the restaurant staff was just great.  On my second visit when I arrived without a reservation (Comme \u00c7a was closed during lunch except on Friday-Sunday) the restaurant was fairly packed, maybe because of the MAGIC convention in town.\n\nThe three course lunch Prix Fixe ($20.12) is fairly simple, pick one item from each section (6 Appetizers, 6 Main Courses and 3 Desserts) with some selections that required an additional $10 or $15 up charge.   Overall, I thought this lunch special is healthy,  delightful and perfect for a quick lunch break for anyone that is available to take advatage of this during from noon to 2:30pm.\n\nSince I have only been to the restaurant twice, I obviously have not tried even half of their 2012 lunch menu, but below are quick comments on what I did ordered or tasted.\n\n--Appetizer--\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with Green Bell Pepper, Sweet Onion & Couscous.  The scallop were nicely grilled, the bell pepper pieces could have been grilled longer (grilled separately from the scallop), overall a very light and healthy hors d'\u0153uvre portion appetizer.\n\nCanadian Classic with Willy Krauch Nova Scotia Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, Red Onion & The World Famous St. Viateur Bagel from Montreal.  You get half a bagel with slices of smoked salmon (which was good and not overly salty) with the other ingredients on the plate for you to customize your traditional smoked salmon bagel.  The bagel itself was good, but I am not sure about it being \"world famous\".  \n\nGrilled Octopus made with Sashimi Quality Mediterranean Octopus that is charcoal-broiled.  Nice generous portion, the octopus was not overcooked and rubbery, but I will most likely not order this in future visits.\n\n--Main Course--\nLavraki, grilled Mediterranean Bass served with Broccoli.  Absolutely recommends this for anyone that loves fish. The bass is simply prepared with traditional Greek-style Mediterranean flavoring (lemon, pepper, olive oil), but when you start with good fresh fish, you don't need to overpower it with extra flavoring.  My friends and I all ordered and loved this!\n\nHonjake Salmon with Steamed Vegetable (Broccoli).  Nicely grilled, maybe a little undercooked for some people's taste, but it was perfect for me.  Again, very tradional Mediterranean flavor profile on this light lunch bite and recommended.\n\nNova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta ($15 supplementary charge). I did not ordered this but would love to try it in future visits.\n\n--Dessert--\nWalnut Cake with Kaimaki Ice Cream.  It was a good dessert, the online menu calls it a Walnt Pie but I would definitely call it a Walnut Cake.  The Kaimaki Ice cream has a unique flavor and almost chewy texture, and I read that it is commonly served with baklava and kataifi and other syrupy-sweets.  Pick this for dessert, unless you have a nut allergy.\n\nYogurt Martini.  My friends thought it was too tart, but I liked it enough to order this all for myself on my second visit. \n\nAmbiance: 5/5.  I love the lighting, layout and the generous use of white in the restaurant. The restaurant looks gorgeous on a sunny and not too overcast days during lunch.\n\nFood:  4.5/5.  Very nice lunch special menu.  Great deal at an upscale restaurant in a popular Strip property.\n\nService:  4.5/5.  The waiters are great.  On my first visit, our waiter took the time to explain the menu and even brought us the dinner menu to check out and encouraged us to visit for dinner, which he said is a different experience than their lunch.\n\nValue:  5/5.  For lunch, this is a great deal.  \n\n5 stars all the way."

The texture almost resembled frozen yogurt, and it went perfectly with the strawberry.\n\nI'll be going back soon."

The food was amazing, ordered the raw fish sampler as an appetizer and all of it was delicious and for the main course I ordered the grilled mediterranean seabass, it was cooked perfect, moist with touch of citrus and olive oil.  Everything tasted super fresh.  The drinks were delicious too, had their signature spiced pear martini and really good house cab.\n\nI can't wait to try it again!"

            "review": "My wife, her parents and I went to this restaurant last night for dinner. It is possibly the most expensive restaurant at the Cosmopolitan. \nWe had reservations and we arrived on time. The friendly employee said we had to wait a few minutes for our table to be ready and suggested we wait at the bar. We hung out near the bar area, but weren't interested in a drink. We only had to wait about two minutes-not bad. We got a nice seat and looked at the menu. The list on entrees are very small. It is small because they have a lot of fish choices and a separate raw bar menu. So the menu is deceptively small.  There is a \"fish market\" like set-up in which you and your server go to check out the fish and shellfish resting on crushed ice. Most of the fish run about $50 a pound and average about 3 pounds. You have to get the whole fish so sharing is the norm in this restaurant. We had a grilled branzino (they called it something else) which was incredible and our grilled octopus appetizer was possibly the best dish I have ever had-anywhere! It was that good. \nThat being said, I am only giving this restaurant 3 stars because of the Lobster Pasta we shared. At $120 for a serving for two, it better have been fantastic. It wasn't. I don't think Macaroni Grill offers a Lobster Pasta, but if they did it would be better than this! Estiatorio Milos needs to spruce up the Lobster Pasta dish immediately or remove it from their menu.\nA nice balcony with a fairly good view. Looks to be great for a dinner party.\nAs for expensive, four people ran about $150 per person. OUCH! Top Ramen for us for a while!"

            "review": "When I think of Greek, I think of gyros and baklava.  I think most Americans don't think much of Greek food outside of gyros and baklavas, but my cabbie from the airpot was Greek and said I should check this place out or he'd dump me out in North Las Vegas and kill me and dump my body in the desert.  I started off at the bar and the bartender was very helpful with the wines which was all Greek to me.  Yes, I'm going to abuse that line many times in this review.  Most of the by-glass was Greek, and I told him what I usualy drank, Gallo, and he punched me in the face.  I told him I like Willamette Pinot and he offered me a taste of an Agiorgitiko that was almost a carbon copy of Willamette Pinot.  The guy knew his stuff.  Excellent bar service.  My date arrived and we hit the tables, literally, I was a bit drunk.  We were escorted to the fish display which is like one of those fish market displays with the fish in ice and the prices per pound, except these prices were much higher than I'm used to, even at Whole Foods.  We're talking $57/lbs and the like, but they fly them in fresh straight from the Mediterranean, so Fedex or DHL accounts for $10/lb or something like that.  They probably also get one of those EU VAT (Value Added Taxes) added on top of that.  Not the most environmental thing to do, express shipping fish from the Mediterranean, but this is the authentic Greek experience and well worth it.  The cabbie told me that the Greeks grill fish in a very special way.  The St. Pierre that we chose also known as a John Dory is a white, soft, mild tasting fish.  The sauce was light, so I ventured to ask for melted butter.  The waiter told me to leave immediately.  Actually, he politely informed me that the Greek do not like to overwhelm the taste of the meat with sauces like the French do, and I dunked my St. Pierre in butter and thanked him for the Anthony Bourdain lesson.  It tasted soooooo much better slathered in butter.  I'm not ashamed in the least.  We were in Vegas and we should do as the Vegans do, order A1 with a filet mignon, melted butter with a John Dory, American mustard with a bratwurst.  I actually went to Hofbrauhaus with friends earlier and one friend was annoyed they didn't have American mustard for his weiner.  Probably the best part of the meal was the dessert.  My date ordered a baklava.  She had never had baklava.  I always thought better of her, but if you haven't had baklava by your 30's, you obviously have lived a sheltered life.  I went out on a limb and ordered something I never heard of before, Galaktoboureko.  I couldn't pronounce it and just pointed to the item like I do at Chinese restaurants.  While the baklava was okay, we shared the Galaktoboureko and my date fell out of her chair.  I was highly impressed too.  I asked the waiter what it was again, and he said, \"Galactic Bootie Call,\"  It was a Galactic Bootie Call for my mouth.  \n\nWhen you look for fine dining, the typical American will pick some fancy steak house, French or Italian place.  I don't know why national cuisines seem to be categorized by price range.  I mean, nobody thinks of taking their date out to an expensive Ecuadorian or Kenyan restaurant.  I think it's racist.  The Italians aren't even rich people.  They were part of the EU PIGS, the countries that almost sank the entire EU economy during the Great Recession.  Dubai is one of the richest countries in the world, but you never hear of an expensive Dubai restaurant.  Americans are also some of the riches, but go to Europe or Asia and all they think of American cuisine is McDonalds and BBQ ribs or something.  \n\nIf you want a change of pace from the old, boring, conventional French, Italian, steakhouse or even expensive sushi or now expensive tapas joint, check this place out and you will be pleasantly surprised.  We know the Greeks for their great philosophers and homo-erotic college organizations, but we forget, besides those boring gyro yogurt sandwiches, they do have great cuisine."

Because you have to order the entire fish, you and your dining partner have to be like-minded. We chose the red snapper and although they said they pull the bones out, there were MANY left in the fish. He had warned us about possible bones in the \"collar\" which we didn't even go near. We ended up giving up, despite the fish being very tasty. We mentioned it and the restaurant brought us a dessert to share (on the house).\nOnly Greek wines available by the glass and very price at that.\nDelicious Greek salad.

We also had the fish roe app, it looked like humus but tasted awesome. The reason for the low rating is because we went here for the octopus. Supposedly it's the best in town, it's not. We sent it back, the meat was very tough. The server came back and told us it was 86'd because other guests returned it as well. They didn't offer us anything else in its place. No other app, no free drink, no dessert. I think they handled it very poorly, I felt snubbed. We did order dessert, and it was ok. I'm not sure I will go back. The food was very delicious, for the most part, but if something is not to satisfaction they are not going to do anything to make up for it. Even though the food was admittedly their fault, they made us feel guilty for returning it. I can't justify spending 300$ for that low level of service."

We both ordered the octopus which on the last visit was wonderful,however this time it was lukewarm in temperature and had the texture of elastic bands. I realize that the texture is a bit chewy but it definitely was a challenge to masticate this appetizer .  The wine pairing was ok,the shrimp was very good and the dessert,Greek yogurt with fruit was ok. When we were asked how our lunch was and we mentioned the sub par octopus the waitress became instantly frosty .  To all,pass on the 32 dollar eggplant appetizer,it's nothing special and extremely overpriced for what it is.  We won't be returning to Milo's,there are plenty of restaurants that offer high quality food at more reasonable prices without the frosty waitstaff."

In a nutshell, during the week for lunch, their only offering is an incredibly priced $20.11 three course lunch menu. There are several options for each course, although many of the premium appetizers do come with a $10 surcharge. \n\nThe atmosphere: AMAZING. Beautiful terrace over the strip that reminds me of one my favorite restaurants in Athens ! The indoor space is light, bright, and beautiful. \n\nService: Well the first time we had the most creepy, rude waiter I've had in a long time. Creepy in that he would hover behind you and breathe loudly without saying anything. Rude in that when I asked how the chef recommended the lamb chops be prepared, he answered with \"Huh? He prepares them how you ask him to\" and gave me a weird look. He also freaked out a bit when I told him we were on our lunch break and asked if we could eat quickly. Our server on my second visit was fine. \n\nAppetizers: On my first visit I had the mezze plate. It was perfectly portioned, and a great way to try a few different things. Everything was super delicious! On my next visit I tried the octopus ($10 surcharge). It was delicious, but it was served luke-warm. I guess they didn't want to overcook it? Who knows. Either way, it was a great portion and the texture was spot-on. \n\nEntree: First visit I had the lamb chop. This was a little bit of a disappointment because it was one TINY lamb chop (2 ounces). That being said, it's a discount menu and clearly I'm a fat idiot for complaining about one of my THREE courses being too small. It was very delicious and well prepared, just small. My friend got the bass and it was AMAZING. Next visit, tried the shrimp. They implied it was covered in cheese, but it definitely was not. The shrimp are fine, just boring and with very little cheese. I don't recommend ordering them. \n\nDessert: The greek yogurt was the best yogurt I've ever eaten. YUM. I've had it twice now. I wish the portion were bigger (it's about 5 bites), but otherwise it's perfect!!!!\n\nIf you're on the strip at lunch time, this is one of the best deals you'll find. Stop paying for over priced food court fare and upgrade to a fine dining experience for just a few dollars more !"

            "review": "This was a strange review to write as the food is top notch and deserves five stars. The only reason I gave it four was due to two issues that will be irrelevant to some people. First, the cheapest bottle of red wine was $70, which I think is ridiculous. I don't think it's asking too much to have a $50 bottle of wine on your menu. I like wine with food, but am not a connoisseur, so the difference between a $50 bottle and a $100 bottle is nil to me. Second, you're much better served going with a group of four or larger. Sides and appetizers state they serve two to four and they are huge and way too large for two people. You will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two people as the seafood bar (more to come later) selections are usually two pounds or more. \n\nOn to the food...amazing. Your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market inside of the restaurant. There is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening. Each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price per pound. Most were in the $50/lb. range. We had originally ordered a Mediterranean Sea Bass, but it was only available at two lbs. or larger, so she recommended a similar selection that I can neither remember nor pronounce, at a pound and a half. Two lbs. would have been far too large for the two of us and we were not interested in leftovers. The seafood was so fresh and simply prepared. It was grilled, lightly seasoned and topped with a little oil. They let the seafood be the star and it is incredible. Our appetizer was the spreads, which included Tzatziki, Hummus, Tarmosalata and Fava. It was great, but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didn't want to fill up on an appetizer. With the seafood we also ordered a side of their grilled peppers. Again, great, but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten. Outstanding meal all the way around, but paid for a good amount of food we couldn't eat. Also, it's pretty amazing that all the fresh seafood can be on ice in the middle of the restaurant and yet no \"fishy\" smell."

They offer a prix fixe menu for lunch that is $25.15 for 3 courses. You get to choose from 3 options each course. The portions are generous for the cost. We left satisfied by our meal (but we did order one additional side of greek fried potatoes...and I recommend that you do the same because they're delicious!).\n2. The cocktails! Mmmm... They have a great seasonal cocktail list. I decided to be adventurous and try one although I didn't know what half of the ingredients were. I'm so glad I did because it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had! \n3. The wine! They offer some fantastic Greek wines. My man did the wine pairing with his meal (which was an additional $24 for 3 glasses) and every wine was crisp, refreshing and delicious! If you know about Greek white wine, this is the place to be!\n4. The service! Impeccable. My water glass was always full, they timed each course out perfectly, they offered more bread and olive oil as soon as we were done, everyone was kind and attentive. The server crumbed our table which I always appreciate. It's the little things. :)\n5. The ambiance! The restaurant is beautiful. It's located on the 3rd floor inside The Cosmopolitan which makes total sense when you see the place. Everything about the Cosmo is modern, clean, and upscale. While you may think that the casino is a bit flashy at first glance, give it a chance. The warmth will make you relax and feel comfortable quickly. The restaurant is indoor seating only but they have a cute patio looking space. I'm not sure if is open or fully enclosed though. The view is of the strip is a plus! Lunch was definitely more casual than expected. There were lots of people wearing shorts and tank tops. I would definitely recommend dressing nicely for dinner. It's a romantic date spot but great for large groups, too. \n\nDefinitely make reservations if you want to dine here! It gets booked quickly and I can see why! Can't wait to go back!"

            "review": "I needed to update this review, my first time here was for my birthday lunch, been wanting to try this place since it opened but couldn't talk any friends into it because it was pretty pricey, but since they have the $20.12 lunch special I knew I could now! We started out with one of the specialty cocktails from the bar, I tried the BeesNees, it sounds good on paper, but I guess glenmorangie wasn't intended to be mixed with other ingredients because it wasn't something I would order again.\n\nThe server brought us the bread basket, and I couldn't get passed the overwhelming smell of burnt toast, I get what they were trying to do and create grill marks on the bread, but all I tasted was burnt bread. So onto the lunch special, I ordered the tomato salad with feta cheese, seasoned with Greek herbs & extra virgin olive oil EXCELLENT! So simple yet so good! Why doesn't mine taste like this at home? Main course I had the Lavraki, SO GOOD (yes I had to use all caps again) this dish is perfection. For dessert, the yogurt martini, again so good! If you like Greek yogurt, you will like this. I snuck a taste of my friends walnut pie, wasn't a fan, tastes like Christmas spice cake.\n\nMy second go around here, my friend and I sat out on the patio, it was nice but really enclosed, just wish they had it more open so you could see the Strip. This time I tried the Lobster Pasta (additional $10 on the lunch menu) I thought it was very fishy, I would def get the Lavraki over this. But the best part of our lunch was, my friend had recently been there for dinner and the server told her that they have a local special where they will do a free wine pairing, well the original server told her the wrong times but our server had told the manager and they were nice enough to honor it for the time we were there, so the Sommelier, who was FANTASTIC, paired each of our courses with a wine. Top  notch service. Love this place."

The biggest detractor was the time of the service, our lunch took over 2 hours.  Most of our party left by the time dessert came.\n\nFood:\n\nAppetizer - I ordered the octopus. It was very tasty, I liked the preparation with the capers. I am not sure if it merited the $10 upcharge.\n\nMain course - I ordered the chicken kebab. The meal was very small and mine was a little bit cold and over cooked. It also had undercooked fries served with it. I believe the chicken being cold was a result of the kitchen not being able to stage the food for such a large group. My one co-worker also ordered the chicken and his was entirely undercooked. He sent it back and they quickly brought out a new one. There weren't any main meals that looked all that impressive.\n\nDessert - I had the walnut cake, it was okay. A coworker of mine had the Greek yogurt and that was very tasty.\n\nOverall, not worth the time or money in a place that has so many different restaurant options. It may be better with a smaller group and/or for dinner but definitely not lunch."

            "review": "I do not normally write reviews but I am so mind blogged about what happened last night that I have to write this. \n \n(Pros: The Greek Salad and The Milo Special.)\n\nThe Greek Salad: It was surprisingly great! It was a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions, that was accompanied by feta cheese and dressed with a vinaigrette. It was very delicious, if you like the tomatoes. If you don't, I would skip it. \n\nThe Milo Special:  At least this is what I think it is called. It was zucchini and eggplant that was lightly fried and had a yogurt dipping with it. That was the highlight of the night. \n\n(Meh: The Calamari and The Wine)\n\nThe Calamari: It was a little chewy. I didn't really care for it. \n\nThe Wine: It was sweet, but I could stomach it. \n\n(Cons: The Service/Staff and The Fish, The Atmosphere, and The Steak Fries)\n\nLet's Start with the food: The Fish was okay. It was basically red snapper with capers, lemon, and olive oil. It was okay, but I had better. It would be in the meh section, but it was 200 dollars. For 200 dollar fish, it better knock my socks off. Also,  it had bones in it. \nThe steak fries were awful. There was no seasoning or anything there and they were soggy. \n\nThe atmosphere: It was was so loud in this place. I couldn't hear anything. We had a large party and couldn't hear half of the conversation. It was very loud. \n\nThe service and staff: They were slow. We arrived at 7:30 didn't leave until 11 or so. Plus, when I asked them to explain a few items on the menu they couldn't adequately explain things to me. (that is if you can hear anything in this place) They are also business people. They like to deceive you here.  \nWe asked for water, they bring us bottled water that they charge 8 dollars a pop for. We asked for fish, they tell us that it can't feed a group of our size, and adds lamb, which is another 200 dollars. (I didn't eat the lamb that is why is it not on here). Its not the prices that were the problem, it was the fact that they deceived us and ranked up the bill. We had eight people and they added 18 percent gratitude on the bill which is probably why he was making a lot of the suggestions.  I rather you be upfront with me about the prices and let me make the choice if I wanted to eat there or not. This is the type of thing that is admired there, and it is a shame. I will not be dining there anymore. But needless to say, we were blindsided by the bill and took about 30 minutes to figure out, which they complained about. It was ridiculous. Never again will I eat there for some mediocre fish.  I had better fish for a 1/20 of that price. Real disappointment."

Octopus tasted good but fish was full of bones and was swimming in olive oil, the pasta was so salty and spicy that it was hard to it. Apparently you pick the fish by weight, and their prices are a little higher than I would pay for this quality. May be it was an off day for a chef but the food was not worth the price. Now about the service, our server was really awkward. It made me never wanna come, really awkward. I had a feeling like he is a sleezy salesman trying to sell us stuff (which he was, selling us the fish and lobster, the higher the weight the more $$$). After we ordered the food, he never came back to check on us. From that point on it was bussers. I would NEVER EVER go back. Stay away!"

Also tried the shrimp saginaki. 4 large shrimp perfectly cooked with a side of flavorful cous cous. Greek yogurt with raspberry sauce was a great refreshing way to finish off the meal. The yogurt was thick, creamy almost like a marscopone. Will definitely return to lunch next time I'm around.\n\n- service was attentive and fast.

            "review": "After hearing wonderful reviews about their lunch special from BFF and yelper Amelinda L., the opportunity to dine there came up recently with her and Sharon L. Their lunch menu, which is priced beautifully at $22.14, features a tasting of seafood that allows you to close your eyes and really visit the mediterranean, even if it's just for a couple hours. \n\nAPPETIZER:\nFor a starter, it was HIGHLY recommended to get the Grilled Octopus, which is composed of sashimi grade imported Mediterranean octopus, which has been charcoil broiled with what appears to be an amazing, fruity, olive oil. This dish DOES have a $10 supplement. Dishes with supplements are a tossup for me. Sometimes it's a win, while others can be a joke. This one is the former - WELL worth it. Amelinda L. joked that she could eat a whole plate of it and although I believed her, after I tried it, I began echoing her sentiment. Truly delicious. I think that what made it so delicious was really the quality of the seafood, and the preparation just made it shine. \n\nTHE MAIN:\nMy main course choice was also recommended to me - the Shrimp Saganaki with tomato and feta cous cous. The flavoring of the Shrimp was so flavorful and perfectly cooked, allowing for the tenderness of the protein to really compliment the flavors. The cous cous was simply bursting with that earthy, rustic flavor with the feta and tomato, and was an amazing compliment. I just wished there were more of it!\n\nDESSERT:\nLastly, I had The Real Greek Yogurt for the dessert. If you love true Greek yogurt - the thickly textured stuff, that's tart and makes your mouth pucker a bit -- then this is for you. A lot of people enjoy Fage and Oikos greek yogurt, but that's on the sweeter side. This is a little more tart but I love it. My recommendation for you if you prefer something on the sweeter side is to get the fresh fruit plate, which Amelinda L. got. It contained a really fresh mix of fruit that was beautifully prepared (with the exception of what looked like a peeled Cutie - just seemed like there could have been a little more effort there - ha!). Sharon L. got the greek yogurt like me and she found it too tart. \n\nDRINK: I ordered a jasmine tea, which was strong and allowed for two brews, which they kindly accomodated. \n\nThe service was top notch, and the environment simply amazing. There's a display of fresh fish on ice towards the kitchen, which was semi-open (but not loud at all) and the view from the windows were lovely. \n\nI'd recommend this as a great choice for locals and visitors alike. The quality of the food for the price is superb. There's an Estiatorio Milos in New York, which I hope to try soon."

We received grilled bread along with EVO to start.  We then shared the Xortopita appetizer (housemade phyllo stuffed with greens, herbs, feta, Greek yogurt and salumi).  Our second appetizer was a Greek meze plate that was truly \"amezing\"; taramasalata, tzatziki, htipita and manouri cheese along with a stuffed grape leaf, olives and cherry tomatoes. Each spread was delicious, but the spicy hitipitia, made from roasted red pepper, feta and other tasty delights, was a pure joy.    \n\nMy wife chose the Honjake salmon which was a bit underdone to suit her taste, but delicious while I opted for the whole lavraki, a farm raised sea bass known in Italy as branzini or branzino, which was finished simply with EVO and capers.  \n\nThe finale of the feast was a slice of walnut cake and a delicious yogurt martini, Greek yogurt topped candied oranges.

It seemed like the staff was still busy prepping for lunch, noted that the inexperienced bar tender was tending the bar while the experienced one was busy prepping.  We witnessed an on the job training evolution after he failed to properly open a bottle of champagne.  The alcohol prices were extremely high, I'm assuming to offset the good deal on the meal.  \n\nWarm grilled bread was served with really good olive oil to start off.  My girlfriend had the skewered scallops with couscous and I had the tomato salad.  The scallops were tasty but could have used a touch more char and the couscous was fluffy but needed a little more season.  The tomato salad with hothouse cucumbers and onions was fresh and the feta delicious; salty and not overly pungent.  For the entree we ordered the salmon and the sea bass.  Both were cooked very well, the salmon serving was large and both were platted with steamed broccoli.  Although deboned, there were a few straggler bones which the server reminded me of at delivery.  \n\nService, service, service.  The restaurant started to fill up during this time and we ordered dessert with the bar tender; Walnut pie and fresh fruit plate.  There was an uncomfortable delay of about 30 minutes until this arrived, a void which we filled with a few $16 glasses of Chardonnay.  The Walnut pie was actually cake which disappointed us however the sorbet it was topped with was tasty and combined nicely with the cake.  The fruit plate was composed a disappointing 6 blueberries, 1/2 a strawberry, and a thin medallion of orange, grapefruit, and grapefruit and a chunk of pineapple; basically a plate of cocktail garnishes.\n\nA good deal if you don't drink alcohol, food was tasty for the price, service left something to be desired."

It was quite simply spectacular with the understated drizzle of olive oil, capers and lemon that accompanied it. The Lavraki was nicely displayed with head and tail intact, which was nice since i was able to try the collar meat. It had a mildly sweet flavor, my only complaint would be having to pick out the bones in the body.

The food was all very fresh and they give you a tour of their fish market which is located within the restaurant. Imagine a very tiny, very clean Pike Place Market. \n\nWe chose to order about 5 appetizers and one shrimp entree to share. The presentation was very nice, but the portions are quite small. \n\nWe also ordered cocktails, which were unique and tasty. Mine had bourbon, which was different. My sister's was a very cute pink color martini with elderflower in it. \n\nThe decor is tasteful and chic, like most upscale restaurants in Vegas. \n\nOne thing this is a Greek restaurant, but the emphasis is more Coastal Mediterranean than Gyro."

            "review": "My first impressions of Milos was absolutely fantastic.  I definitely recommend it for Greek food fans and especially at lunch if you don't want to break out all of your Vegas winnings.   \n\nOn a Saturday at lunch, it was surprisingly not that busy but I did RSVP in advance.  The decor is beautiful with nice, soft whites everywhere and comfy seating.  There seemed to be some outdoor patio seating as well looking over the Strip which from the Cosmo is super nice.  Service was constant and friendly with constant water refills and good timing.  \n\nLunch specials are currently at about $25-ish for a three-course meal that you get to choose from a small menu (they have a larger menu available but portions are not only bigger but much pricier).  I got the mezze plate, the Lavraki sea bass and the Karidopita Walnut Cake.  You also get some nice big loaves of bread with some awesome olive oil.  The mezze plate looks sparse but the flavors on the plate are marvelous.  The hummus here not only has texture but really has a delicious flavor about it that I haven't had in other hummus plates around.  Also comes with pita bread and some small veggies.  The Lavraki was also simple but tasty/elegant.  Small bones make it annoying to eat (am never a fan) but the fish itself is cooked well with a great presentation.  The use of the olive oil here all over the fish along with the lemon gives it a wonderful taste.  And finally, the Karidopita is also simple/small but has an absolutely amazing taste to it and is surprisingly sweet/poignant but not overbearingly so.  \n\nAll-in-all, if you like Greek food and want a great meal overall, Milos is a fantastic experience that I'm sure to come back to."

Over $300 for 2 people without a bottle of wine (just a glass and 1 cocktail) and without dessert. \n\nBar service- When we got there, the table wasn't ready (we had reservations). They told us we would wait at the bar if we wanted. We walked over to the bar, which wasn't packed but people were seated there. The bartenders never acknowledged us, never looked up, despite our numerous attempts to get their attention, get a drink. etc. We were there 20 minutes, never got anyones attention before we finally were taken to our table. \n\nSommelier- I wanted a glass of wine, but am only familiar with california wines. Here, they have mostly greek wines. The waiter suggested a wine based on my description and offered a taste and also then sent the sommelier over. I tasted it and told the sommelier that it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I tried to describe what I might be looking for. He said that what he had was too this or too that. I asked if maybe they had a bottle of something we could order since he didn't think there was anything they sold by the glass he thought I would like. He stood silent, then stood there staring at me, then off in the distance for literally 2-3 minutes waiting for, I don't know what. I blindly stared at the menu, then him, not sure what he was expecting me to do. At a loss and very uncomfortable at this point, I ended up caving and ordering a glass of the wine I had already told him I really didn't like just to get him to leave. What a mistake, but when someone tells you he has nothing he thinks you'll like then doesn't leave, what do you do?\n\nFood- the appetizer was average to even below average, the fried zucchini was cold and soggy. The main, grilled fish, was fresh and seasoned well, but the waiter advised us where the bones would be, collar, shoulder. Wrong, there were bones everywhere. Not so appetizing digging bones out of every bite. \n\nGo somewhere else."

See, we had to solve our \"too many restaurants, not enough goddamn time\" problem somehow, so we just snagged a small plate or two from a few different restaurants. AMAZING. \n\nMilos was so good that it ended up on our crawl both days. The first night we cozied up to the bar (I just love cozying) and got a plate of grilled octopus and a couple of Greek whites. Neither of us know a lot about Greek wine so we had a lot of questions for the bartender, and she was super helpful and let us try her two favorites before we got a full glass of something. And that octopus was something divine, people. Octopus is one of those things that is close to perfection if done right, but horrible if not done wrong. This was 100% in the former category: super fresh, grilled, and seasoned just slightly with olive oil, etc. When your seafood is this good, there's not much you have to do. \n\nAnd that's what brought us back our second night. It was near the end of the crawl and what did we want? Some of the freshest seafood on the Strip. So we went back, sampled a different Greek white, and had the tasting of raw fish: salmon, tuna, sea bass, and one more white fish whose name I can't remember (booze, sorry). Again, the freshness is the star here, with just some light seasoning. \n\nThe prices are expensive here, even for Vegas. I guess they have to make up for that super reasonable lunch special all of you are talking about somehow. But, you know, for the experience, for my wonderful night, for THE FOOD, it was so worth it."

They take you over to a large selection of fresh fish on ice, and go over the different fish and their taste profile. I was admittedly a little nervous picking out a fish, and choosing a cooking method, but our waiter helped us choose a gorgeous Red Emperor. Since there were only two of us, we choose a smaller fish, but larger groups can choose much larger fishes and have them cooked in a salt crust. The fished was cooked perfectly. They warned us that there might be a few bones to watch out for, but my fillet didn't have a single one. \n\nThis is definitely a restaurant for which you want to get a reservation, and wear some nice clothes.

This place is located in the Cosmo but for some reason, it wouldnt let me check in because the yelp check in location is miles from Cosmo. That was annoying. It opened at 11:30 so we got there right before it opened. It is a pretty big restaurant so the wait wasnt long. It is quite fancy so people tend to dress up here. I came here on a Saturday and they still had the prix fixe which is nice because at other places, they only offer them on weekdays. It costs $22.14 since the items I got werent upgrades. \n\nAppetizer\n1) Canadian Classic- THis is raw salmon with cream cheese and a bagel. This was delicious and I wish I got this instead of my salad. When you put all of these together, it is the magic\n2) Tomato Salad- People mentioned this a lot so I decided to try it. It is literally tomato pieces so I was quite disappointed. However, the tomato was super flavorful and I was quite surprised. If I had to choose, I would order the Canadian Classic though.\n\nMain Course\n1) Lavraki- This is the dish most people get. It is grilled Mediterranean bass and it was delicious! I couldnt believe how good it was and I enjoyed every bite. I highly recommend\n2) Nova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta- If you are willing to pay $15 on top of the $22, I highly recommend this dish. The tomato sauce has a hint of cream so it was so good on the pasta. The lobster was yummy and I was totally enjoying some of this with my Lavraki. \n\nDessert-\n1) Fresh fruit- The fruit is quite fresh and comes with pineapple, grapefruit, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. I was disappointed that they didnt have an actualy pasty dessert but I love fruit. I didnt want greek yogurt anyway so this was good.\n\n\n**TIPS**\n1) The perfect $22 would be Canadian Classic, Lavraki, and fruit. Yummmm. It was totally worth it and you get so much goodies for so cheap.\n2) Enjoy!\n\n\n**TIPS**\n1) I looked up prix fixe lunches in Vegas online and people say this is the best prix fixe at such a great price.

Definitely won't take as long to come back here.  \n\nMy petite wife gets cold pretty easily.  Anyone else ever bring a snuggie to the movie theater?  So being seated on the terrace was the clear choice.  The sunlight, high ceilings and decor really transports you somewhere else.

The 3 course lunch for $20.12 was what we were here for.  \n\nAppetizer:\n\nMy wife got the Greek meze plate which had tarama (creamy paste with fish roe), tzatziki (cucumber yogurt), htipiti (Greek feta dip, kinda like hummus), manouri cheese (like super creamy feta), olives and cherry tomatoes along with a side of pita.  Yum yum.  The tarama was the clear standout as it was the first time either of us had eaten that before.  I love fish roe and all things caviar.  \n\nI shelled out the extra $10 for the grilled octopus: sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled with lemon and olive oil.  It was worth every....single....penny.  Grilled octopus has to be one of the top 10 meats of all time!  I cut the pieces even smaller to try and savor each bite.  \n\nEntree:\n\nAnd just when I thought things couldn't get any better...they DID!  The waiter and a lot of Yelp reviews stressed the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean bass) and it was so fucking good.  I could eat this for lunch 3 times a week for the rest of my life easy!!  A whole bass grilled up with lemon and oil was simple yet perfect.  I even ate the head bits and eyeballs for chrissakes!! \n\nMy wife went with the tuna burger but it was pretty much carb overload at that point.  Between the second bread basket, pita from the meze and then the bun on the burger, she just went from the protein.  The tuna was cooked nicely.  I think there was an orange slice in it?  The zuchinni fries were great as well.  They added mint to them which had them take on a whole different taste than the usual way they're done.  \n\nDessert:     \n\nWalnut pie with kaimaki ice cream was like a super spiced coffee cake and my wife loved the yogurt martini.\n\nI am not so hot on the dinner prices here but I would recommend this lunch to anyone.

Although my husband wasn't too sure about eating three courses for lunch in fear of not having room for dinner, he was instantly satisfied after our meal and said the portions were just right. The food was simply amazing and the service was impeccable. Our waiter was very attentive throughout the entirety of the meal, and the rest of the staff assisted in this as well. The only thing I didn't find satisfactory was the behavior of the manager. Being seated near the front entrance, I heard the manager speaking on the phone and I was immediately startled to hear the foul language that was coming from her. She slammed the phone down and exclaimed \"HOLY F&$%!\" and while walking away stated; \"ARE YOU F$%^ING KIDDING ME?\" I feel this is very inappropriate behavior for the type of restaurant Estiatorio Milos presents itself to be. My husband and I are quite particular as to where choose to spend our money, and do not expect the execration that was displayed. We feel her unruly and unprofessional behavior is less to be desired, and I truly hope the rest of the staff doesn't follow her lead. Other than this distasteful occurrence, this is a fine establishment."

Since Earl and I will be volunteering to welcome our awesome veterans at The Cosmopolitan, it was just the perfect time to grab lunch prior.\n\nI called to make a reservation yesterday and got it no problem.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by three friendly hostesses.  One of the hostess walked us to the table that oversee the strip's view.  \n\nThe server that helped us was very knowledgeable and professional.  Service was impeccable.  Our glasses were never half empty...NEVER!  Once we are done with our plates, they were immediately taken away.  They served us grilled bread with a fragrant extra virgin olive oil.  I love bread so I attacked it, and crumbs were all on my side of the table.  Server joked that Earl must be eating the bread and dropped the crumbs on my side since his side was so clean...But anyways, he made sure that those crumbs are off the table.\n\nEarl and I ordered the following:\n-appetizer: fresh diver scallop on a skewer, and grilled octopus - fresh diver scallops (2) were cooked to perfection.  They were sweet and plump.  Grilled octopus, which cost $10 more, was Ah-Mazing!  So delicious that Earl asked if he can just have it again as an entree.  Wowee, it was done right!  Juicy, tender, and full of flavor.  It was so perfect with the capers and red onion.  Worth the extra $10.\n\n-entree: Lavraki (Mediterranean bass) and Lamb Chops -the bass was sweet and simple.  It really showcase the fish.  The lamp chops cost $10 more but again, very worth it.  I am not a fan of lamb chops, but am a fan of Milos' lamb chops.  They were juicy and tender (we ordered medium-rare).  This was served with french fries and collard greens.  Even the french fries were cooked to perfection, and I am not a french fries eater.\n\n-dessert:  we both got the walnut cake with the kaimaki icecream.  It was nice and moist and the icecream was refreshing.  We can't tell what the distinct flavor suppose to be for the kaimaki icecream.  I will google later.  Anyways, I wish I had ordered the yogurt, just to taste and see if I like it.\n\nEarl also ordered Dogfish IPA for the app and entree, and an expresso for dessert.  Our total bill including tip was just shy of $100.  If you stick to just the basics for the three course lunch, it is $20.13.  \n\nWhen Earl's brother is in town, Milos is where we will be for lunch."

The grilled octopus appetizer had amazing flavor, if it's on the menu I highly suggest ordering that. I had the sea bass which was light and flaky. To finish it off I had the fruit plate that had an assorted berries n citrus.

The restaurant has a really beautiful fresh fish on ice presentation at one end, which if you appreciate the look of just-caught fish (husband is an avid tuna and salmon fisherman) is not to be missed.  \n\nWe sat at the bar and had good service from Tony. Upon Tony's recommendation we ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and a half Greek salad, neither of which disappointed.  The grilled octopus could make a believer out of any non-seafood fan.  It was tender without being too chewy and wonderfully seasoned with oregano and olive oil.  The Greek salad (it may have been Tomato Salad on the menu) was a traditional Greek salad with feta, cucumbers, tomatoes, olive oil.  Not re-inventing the wheel but that's Greek food - simple ingredients with complex tastes when done right.  That being said, I wouldn't spend the big money to come here for a full-on dinner.  But it works great for a light meal.\n\nProbably wouldn't come back to Vegas unless it was for work (too noisy, crowded and hot for me) but, if so, would visit Milos again."

I ordered the meze plate, which comes with a red pepper hummus, white fish spread, cucumber tziki sauce, feta cheese, olives, and pita. I wish the pita bread had a little more flavor, but the spreads were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon bagel and this was also very good. I suggest getting both and splitting! \n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I ordered the salmon. I can easily say this was one of the best cooked pieces of salmon I have ever eaten. There was olive oil and capers drizzled on the broccoli and salmon and that was the perfect amount of seasoning that was needed. I was debating about ordering the sea bass or the salmon before and I'm happy I went with the salmon. \n\nThe dessert options were greek yogurt or fruit. Not that I should have to tell you this, but you should order the greek yogurt. It comes with a raspberry puree and was a decadent and perfect end to the meal.

I used to go regularly when I'd stay at the Cosmopolitan, when it was expensive, but good, but after a recent spate of bad visits, I've eaten my last dish at Milos. This review is of my last visit.\n\nThe seafood is pretty decent, but there's something very odd about the place these days. Walking in today (on a Friday evening) the restaurant was virtually empty, but with a bizarrely huge amount of staff: probably 5 staff members per customer, standing in groups around the restaurant having urgent looking / hushed conversations amongst themselves.\n\nIt just felt like there was a stench of death about the place: rather like when a restaurant is closing down. No idea if this is the fate of Milos, although I know the Cosmopolitan has recently changed hands so it wouldn't surprise me. Either way, that's how it felt. Pretty ugly. A table next to us sat down, waited for ten minutes, then decided not to stick around and walked out without even ordering. I wish we'd followed their lead.\n\nService was atrociously, brutally slow. 30 minutes for starters. 1 hour 20 minutes for mains. When we asked as to the whereabouts of our mains, we were haughtily told \"Do you know how long it takes to cook a 3lb fish?\". Actually, yes we do: because we've eaten at far nicer restaurants than yours, and none of them take that long to cook a piece of fish (although if they did, they might at least have the customer service skills to apologize for it).\n\nAt the end of dinner, we asked to speak to a manager to discuss how long our meals had taken, and the issues we'd had with our server. He was sympathetic, acknowledging our experience wasn't the greatest, and told us \"I hope we haven't lost you as customers\".\n\nAnd with that, he smiled, and disappeared, leaving us with a bill of over $500 for 4 people (no alcohol, no deserts). Never, ever again."

The reason for 3 stars is due to the subpar service . The waiter staff helping us was not friendly and seemed uninterested in their jobs. They were no fun and although we went at 9pm they were ready to rush us out of there . Food great , service horrible. I should of complained to the manager on how terrible the service was."

Way way overpriced, even their happy hour \"specials\". \nThe food was tasty, I enjoyed the fried cheese (fried cheese in anyway is always delicious IMO). The humus was very tasty too. I liked the sourdough (which I usually hate) and loved the olive oil that accompanied it. And that's it. Everything else was eh. The portions for the above were teeny tiny. The first time we ordered the fried cheese we got 4 small, but bite size portions. It was so good, we ordered them again. Took AN HOUR, seriously, AN HOUR, to get them. (bartender said he was checking on them and escalated to the manager, but come one....an hour!!!) AND, to top it off, we got 3 teeny tiny pieces this time. Major eye roll.\nThe drink prices were ridiculous. Every one was over $17 and they didn't even sound good. A few I saw didn't look great either. \nI know you gotta pay rent, but you can still offer a good deal. Maybe the lunch specials are better as a few of my Yelp gals seem to enjoy the place based on those. I doubt I'd come back though. I was very displeased with my experience."

Our server was wonderful and he walked us around the entire place, explaining all the different seafood to us along the way.  This place is cool because all the seafood is displayed around the room on ice (sort of like a very, very nice fish market) and you get to pick what you want.  We were instantly sold on the \"Scorpino\" when the server told us that it's a fish that feeds on crustacians and shellfish...HAD to be delicious...and it was!   We shared him and a small rock lobster as well as a few side dishes.  The food was to-die-for and the service matched.  This is probably our favorite Vegas restaurant and we've been to lots!  Warning:  we paid zero attention to prices and ended up with a $400 price tag before the tip, so this isn't a budget restaurant.  However, I'll admit we might have gone a little overboard on ordering.  :)  \n\nGo here for sure!"

Everytime I visit Las Vegas I will be visiting Estiatorio Milos for lunch. Their lunch menu is a 3 course (I guess you can call it a tasting menu) meal for $22.13/pp. It USED to be $19 and some change but a $3 increase? Can't really complain about that because I personally would pay $30/pp easily without a complaint. \n\n***\n\nAppetizer\n\nCanadianClassic\nWilly Krauch Nova Scotia Smoked Salmon cream cheese, red onion &\nthe World Famous St.Viateur Bagel from Montreal\n(instead of the usual eggs and potatoes brunch item you really cant go wrong with smoked salmon from Nova Scotia. So clean and refreshing)\n\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous\n(forget beef sticks or traditional skewers. The scallop here was fresh and delicious. A definite order)\n\nNOTE: (the infamous sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled was not available for the day. It is a $10 supplementary charge .. but trust me from what other reviewers wrote about his dish. I WOULD HAVE ORDERED A COUPLE OF THESE FOR THE HELL OF IT)\n\n\nMainCourse\n\nLavraki grilled Mediterranean bass\n(Not gonna lie. I've eaten my fair share of fish from all parts of the world. This may be the best cooked fish I've had in comparison to Le Bernardin. That's a bold statement to say because no one prepares seafood better than Chef Eric Ripert. But man o man this dish was cooked perfectly. A light taste and very fulfilling.\n\nNova Scotia Deep SeaLobster Pasta light tomato sauce ($15 supplementary)\n(i cannot explain how beautiful this dish was. i will post a photo if a few to Yelp. Me personally at the present time, im on a low carb diet and I had to forgo that for this pasta. Extremely delightful and beautifully crafted. worth the extra $15 and you'd be a fool to not order this.\n\n\nDessert\nWalnut Cake with Kaimakiice cream\n(I can't even pronounce this ice cream. all I know is .. this ice cream is out of this world)\n\nThe Real Greek Yogurt\n(served in a martini glass .. yogurt full of class and serenity. great to finish off your breathtaking meal.\n\nIF YOU CAN TAKE ONE THING OUT OF MY REVIEW. JUST TRUST ME. THIS RESTAURANT IS A MUST VISIT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT .. THEN YOU CAN STICK TO YOUR LOCAL BUFFET AND LIVE A MISERABLE UNINTERESTING DINING EXPERIENCE. MAKE YOUR RESERVATION NOW DUMMY!"

We arrived a few minutes late for our 2pm reso but were accommodated anyway.\n\nAmbiance: Large space with views of the kitchen and an outdoor seating area.  Well lit, bright, and welcoming with nice music at a reasonable volume.  The kind of setting that makes you just want to sit and stay!\n\nFood: We chose the pre fixe lunch and were very happy.  For the price, you cannot get better quality food in Las Vegas.  Portions were very nicely sized- we left feeling full but not uncomfortable.  My favorite was the grilled octopus while my boyfriend raved about the grilled bass and the meze plate, but we left agreeing that would could easily return quite often!\n\nService: Would give the service 3.5 stars.  It was absolutely fine- but nothing memorable.  I was disappointed however because I had requested patio seating when I made the reso on open table and that was not honored.  I had also mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday.  At a restaurant of that quality I think special celebrations should at least be acknowledged- I dont need anything free but something as simple as a candle (in a cake I paid for) would be a nice touch.\n\nWould recommend for: romantic date, lunch with friends, fine to take your parents to but leave the little kids at home.\n\nThis was truly one of the best meals we've had in Vegas.  Everything is so very fresh.  We look forward to a reason to return!"

            "review": "I think it goes without saying at this point, that for $22.13 (not including any upcharges for some items), this is possibly one of the best values in Vegas. It set a pretty high standard for itself, and hit the mark dead on, then while the mark was down on the floor, it kicked it a few times to ensure it hit it. Let's take it from the top.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in an elegant, somewhat minimalist manner. Nothing really screams greek about the place, and there's a huge fish display right infront of the kitchen area, with lots of ice and seafood. My girlfriend felt displays like this were a waste, but they actually come by the display and take fish off of it and into the kitchen.\n\nStarting with the appetizer, I instantly went for the octopus (+$10), while my girlfriend had the scallop. I noticed a number of reviews had stated the octopus was extremely tender - mine was actually not tender. It wasn't tough at all either, or rubbery. I think the texture could be described as dense, meaty octopus. I think I'd liken it to eating cheese (which sounds gross, but bear with me here), where your teeth cut through it slowly. The octopus itself was very flavorful as well. Definitely the winner of the lunch, and probably the best I've ever had. The scallop was grilled well, and not waterlogged or milky. My girlfriend didn't talk much while eating it, so you know she was enjoying it (ha).\n\nFor our mains, my girlfriend had the lamb, and I had the grilled bass. The bass was simple, but expertly prepared. The capers were a welcome addition with a spot of acidity to balance out the olive oil, and I really didn't see many bones at all despite the waiter's warning. My girlfriend enjoyed her lamb, but didn't think it was the best she's ever had. She didn't touch the steak fries, but I loved them. This place makes some damn fine steak fries. Not mealy, but retains a sort of fluffiness that's not usually found in steak fries, with a crisp exterior.\n\nDessert was pretty forgettable, to be honest. The yogurt was a step above the supermarket greek yogurt, but nothing to fawn over. The fresh fruit plate was... a fresh fruit plate. Both were lighter options as a finish to a \"light\" meal.\n\nWe each made out at 33.13 before tax and tip, which we agreed was well worth the money for the quality of food you get here. I'd come back every time I'm in Vegas if they keep offering their prix-fixe lunch."

This staff was friendly, attentive, not too pushy, and very helpful.  He talked us away from ordering the whole appetizer of spreads, and instead told us to just choose one, since many of the other appetizers already come with a spread.  We told our waiter we wanted to steer away from things that were too \"alive\" looking, and he didn't pressure us to get anything we didn't want, even if it was more expensive. \n\nAfter recently traveling to Greece, I wasn't expecting this place to compare.  But, it was DELICIOUS.  \n\nYes, the fish and plates are expensive.  But, you're in VEGAS where a Coke starts around $5! They have fresh and festive food, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  If you want a cheap meal, go somewhere else.  You'll be missing out.\n\nMy four friends and I shared Taramasalata, Milos Special (the best fried zucchini I've ever had), Fried Calamari, 1.5 pounds of Lobster, a Prime Rib, and the Lamb Chops.

My  foodie brother said we should try Estiatorio Milos, having heard about it. I had high expectations after having read reviews on Yelp (which rarely fails me), but I was disappointed. \n          We arrived precisely at 12pm, which is when they open for lunch. We were seated promptly. Actually, the service throughout the meal was quick, which was nice. The one complaint I have is that we were asked how we were doing or how the food was by a few different people, at least four times throughout the meal. It was annoying when we were trying to eat... I appreciated that they cared so much about us, but it was excessive. The waiter handed us the three course lunch menu and asked us if we wanted a regular lunch menu. I wish they had just brought a regular menu to us. We both ended up getting the three course lunch menus because of the amazing reviews on Yelp. \n          The bread was really good, the highlight of the meal for me. It was thick, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. It came with some flavorful olive oil to dip it in. \n          I got the grilled octopus appetizer, while my mom got the crab cake. The octopus was OK, not delicious like I was expecting for a ten dollar supplement. It was seasoned well, but really not spectacular in my opinion. My mom's crab cake was TINY. She liked it, it was good quality crab with a nice sauce, but a better, larger crab cake can be had elsewhere for much cheaper. \n           For our mains, I got the infamous sea bass while my mom got the lobster pasta. My sea bass was very good with perfect seasoning...it was just not melt in your mouth amazing like I expected. My moms pasta had a bland sauce, and the lobster was chewier than it should be. \n          For dessert, I got the walnut cake and my mom got the yogurtini. The walnut cake was yummy; it tasted like carrot cake but nuttier and crumbly. The ice cream that accompanied it was clearly Greek as it was pretty icy. No complaints with the yogurtini. \n         Overall, the meal was OK. I've had better at cheaper places and MUCH better at restaurants that are the same price. For almost one hundred dollars for two people who only drank a bottle of water and got the tasting menus, the price was obscene. Honestly, I usually ignore when people gripe about the price of food on Yelp....I will gladly pay money for delicious food. Don't waste your money here, and go to another one of the many amazing restaurants Vegas has to offer."

What I liked about the the dishes was that the fish were either wild or farmed with no hormones and no antibiotics.  Food safety is important and the quality of the ingredients where you dine should be just as important as how the meal tastes.\n\nFor dessert, there was cake with ice cream but I had the Greek yogurt.

I was also skeptical of their grain fed chicken - um, most chickens are fed grain so how is this chicken different? The waiter said it was because they aren't fed corn. Um, corn is a grain, too, buddy. I was offended by the chef's attempt to make their menu sound more environmentally friendly and are actually trying to make Atlantic farmed salmon seem like a delicacy. \n\nMenu labels and the waiter who obviously wasn't well versed in their offerings, the actual food we ordered was underwhelming.

I live in NY, we have excellent fish, excellent Greek fish places.  But Milos topped them.  Everything was simply prepared and fresh - there's no real way to know what they did differently than anyone else, just that it worked.  \n\nThe greek salad was served the way the greeks made it.  The tomatoes were super flavorful, the cheese was excellent.  Again - simple preparation with few ingredients just done very very well.  And they use very high quality olive oil - the first thing our party noticed.\n\nYou're not paying for fancy sauces or elegant platings - you're paying for extraordinarily well prepared food.  I plan to go back next time in Vegas."

            "review": "Milos (estiatorio means restaurant in Greek) is a popular place in the Cosmopolitan at CityCenter. We heard they offered a great prix fixe lunch, and we ended up waiting a day for a reservation. Upon arrival, I was surprised to see a few empty tables, despite waiting customers in the lobby. Perhaps they were short-staffed? There's a small bar to the right as you enter, then a large dining room with a view of the Strip. Ask for a view table if that's important to you. \n\nThe prix fixe includes an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert for $20.13, a decent deal for a Strip resto. The staff were very attentive but I was a little disappointed our waitress wasn't more knowledgeable. I asked her the source of their salmon and she knew only that it was farmed. We decided to go with the meze plate and \"Canadian Classic\" for appetizers, the lavraki and lamb chops for the main courses, and we both had the karidopita for dessert. \n\nThe meze plate came with pita and three dips, one with cheese and roasted red peppers, tzatziki, and a dip made with some kind of white fish. All were pretty good, but none stood out. The white fish dip surprisingly didn't taste of fish at all. The Canadian Classic consisted of Nova Scotia smoked salmon and half a St Viateur bagel (one of the best bagels you can have!), served with cream cheese, red onions, capers, and a lemon wedge. This was a delicious appetizer! THe smoked salmon was creamy and briny, and the bagel tasted like it was just baked a few hours prior.\n\nLavraki is a Mediterranean seabass, a fairly firm but mildly flavored white fish. The lamb chops were available for a $10 upcharge and was served with french fries. Both were served a a broccoli shrub. I guess they don't believe in chopping things up. The bass was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and a touch of lemon, but that was enough. The fish was fresh, cooked perfectly, and melted in your mouth. Considering the $10 charge, I expected a bit more than than the two small lamb chops that were served. They were also a little underdone (I asked for medium and they were served medium rare), but very tasty. \n\nKaridopita is a Greek walnut cake flavored with cinnamon and moistened with a light simple syrup. It was served at Milos with an interesting mint and evergeen flavored ice cream. The cake was moist and sweet, but not cloyingly so, and airy. The crumb was a bit rough, but that could be normal for this cake. The ice cream was really the star, in my opinion. I wouldn't call it delicious but the flavor was so interesting, I wanted more than the dollop atop the cake.\n\nAll in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal here, and particularly thought the prix fixe was well worth it for the quality of food. A great find!"

The fish was so delicate and so tasty.  The olive oil and the salt made the dish.  It was very good.\n\nCourse 2:  Grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.  Another winner of a dish.  The octopus was so tasty and the mushrooms were very good. \n\nCourse 3:  Grilled Mediterranean sea bass.  It was the whole fish with the head cut off and placed to the left of the opened fish.  The server cautioned me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.  A very tasty fish, perfectly cooked to preserve its moistness.\n\nCourse 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  Very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.  \n\nThe meal came with a basked of bread--2 slices in my case--I was dining alone.  There was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.\n\nI really like the room.  The decor is very nice that I'd like to call modern rustic.  The lights have small filaments in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.  The furniture is modern.\n\nService was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 minutes after me and they took a lot of time.\n\nA few things keep this from getting 5 stars.  Between the second and third course, the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.  As he was doing it he said, \"You're done with the bread, right?\"  I was so surprised by his question and his taking that I just shook my head in agreement.  Maybe he thought I had eaten the main course and would soon have dessert.  Maybe I should have jammed a fork into his hand if I had one.  He'd already taken that.  \n\nThere were several small bones in the main part of the fish.  I could just imagine being a judge on Chopped and having my say about that.  Very surprising.\n\nLast, I wish they'd shut the door to the outside.  It was Saturday night and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the Cosmopolitan.  There's also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethings who'd spent part of the day at the pool--not just swimming and ogling the ladies--but also indulging in the spirits of their choice.  They were loud and it carried into the restaurant.  Close the door.\n\nI am a fan of Milos.  I will return, and I think I'll do so for their lunch special.   it should be quieter, too!"

            "review": "The BF and I decided to have a date day starting with a nice lunch. I've heard about this 3 course $20.12 meal which used to be weekday. When I found out that they now serve it everyday until 2:30pm we headed straight over. \n\nI love the airy room and the terrace looks like a nice option to enjoy on a rare nice day. It was too hot so we stayed inside. \n\nThey start you off with grilled, crusty bread and some good olive oil.\n\nStarters : \n\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous- the skewer had some of the most fresh and sweet scallops I've had since moving to Vegas. It leads me to believe they weren't pre packaged , but fresh shucked as that's the only time I've had as superior of a scallop.   The preparation was very simple but it showed off the quality well. \n\nGrilled Mediterranean Octopus ($10 supplement) - this was worth the supplement. It was tender, the char was strong but was a nice flavor with the onions, caper and simple lemon, olive oil and sea salt. The BF normally doesn't like octopus because in his mind the texture is too rubbery but he enjoyed this. \n\nMain: \n\nWe both got the Lavraki/ grilled Mediterranean bass - It's a whole fish that just needed some of the lemon and that's it. They buttferfly it and debone except the collar and keep the head, skin on so keep in mind for people who only eat foods that don't resemble the animal they are. I happen to love that they chose to keep it  The flavor was a bit sweet, ocean-y in the right ways. It comes with a few broccoli stems and I thought I would need some sort of starch but I didn't. I had a bit of the bread left and that was enough and didn't take away from the fish. I even convinced my BF to try eating pieces of its face and eyes since it was fresh. Hah.  If you love sea bass like we do then this will make you very happy.  \n\nDessert: \n\nWalnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream - With the description and even the look of the walnut cake I thought it was gonna be rich, warm and buttery and it was not. It took a whole unexpected crumbly texture and was served cold. The kaimaki isn't a ice cream I see often and it was nice to see a very Greek thing on the menu. Oddly, this is a refreshing dessert because of the texture and coolness and our other dessert that I thought was going to be light was the rich one.  \n\nYogurt Martini - this was rich and lovely. It is not like store Greek yogurt if that is what you are expecting but it's almost like a very soft cheese consistency. The berry syrup with it gave the right amount of tang. \n\nIt seems like the portions would make for a skimpy meal, but we were happily full.\n\nThe service was good, courteous, attentive and unobtrusive the way a high end restaurant should be. From our app to main there was a bit of a wait so maybe our fish went to someone else, but they definitely checked on us, apologized for the wait, brought us out more bread and got it to us cooked perfectly. I do not mind waiting for food that is delicious.\n\nThis is a very solid dinner and I feel a \"must do\" on the strip. If you love humble meals that show off the natural flavors of things then this place will impress in freshness. I will definitely be doing this again when family is in town."

We were on time and seated in a timely matter. What upset me was the rash and hurried service displayed by our waiter. He was in no way attentive to our requests, and more so, I felt like he was trying to up sell us in every aspect of our meal.\n\nOur table was immediately directed to the fresh fish display in the corner of the restaurant. From this \"fresh\" display, we were able to systematically choose the fish that we wanted grilled and presented to our table. The entire time that our group deliberated our selections, our waiter continually prodded us to order items off the menu that we did have any desire to even order. Thanks, bud, but we did not want to order your steak in addition to our fish and lobster selection.\n\nOnce seated, our waiter continue to sell menu items even when we told him that what we ordered was sufficient.\n\nThe food. The food was okay. The best thing that we ordered was the Milos Special which was an appetizer shared by the table that consisted of lightly fried zucchini, eggplant tzatziki,and kefalograviera cheese. That was delicious. The meal itself sucked. The fish that we chose came out super mealy, which happens when fish is old. The texture is grainy and breaks apart. That came as a surprise because Eastiatorio Milos prides itself on flying fresh fish from the Mediterranean sea. Gross. On top of that, the lobster that we chose was serve to us...in its whole shell. We tried breaking apart the shell and dispersing it, but we were given inefficient tools that prevented us from even accomplishing that task. We had to finally flag down our waiter for him to take back the dumb dish and break apart the pieces. What the hell was he thinking?\n\nAnd our water cups were left unfilled.\n\nFor spending a pretty penny at this restaurant, the meal was really disappointing. I feel like if this restaurant was transplanted back in Los Angeles, none of this would have happened because there is a certain expectation that diners would have had since this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant. I am not sure whether our waiter expected inexperienced out of towners who don't know any better, but I can tell you that everything about my dining experience here sucked. You suck Estaitorio Milos. I will never come back."

            "review": "Exquisite Greek food with true Greek hospitality and service!\n\nThis review might be long since I want to do this restaurant justice as well as inform readers about true Greek cuisine and clear any misconceptions.\n\nI shall preface this review by saying that as a Greek I can review this restaurant in a much different (and perhaps more complete) way than many reviewers. Many people associate Greek cuisine with various \"Mediterranean\" and Middle Eastern dishes as well as the usual gyros. \n\nGreek cuisine however is not limited to \"feta\" and \"gyro\" but actually has a huge variety of dishes and one of its most important ingredients is a jovial and warm atmosphere along with friends to enjoy and celebrate life. \n\nEstiatorio Milos is located on the 3rd level of the Cosmopolitan resort. The interior has soft hues of grey with wooden accents and Cycladic statues abound: elegant and classy.\n\nThe traditional \"menu\" on the table might not seem to be bristling with choices initially but that is because the real menu lies in front of you: all the fresh fish are exhibited in the same way you'd find them in a Greek sea town taverna, along with labels so you can choose which one you want. Your server will be there with you to explain which fish suits you best, some are sweeter, some are more buttery. It is important to notice that the fish are shipped fresh from Greece as are many of the other ingredients.\n\nThe staff was astounding. I cannot stress this enough. The fact that our server Yiorgo spoke the language of the Fatherland just added a whole different dimension to the service. Very polite, helpful and warm, like a childhood friend almost, he went above and beyond to ensure we got the best food and offered some amazing recommendations both for food and dessert.\n\nAfter discussing with Yiorgo a bit in Greek we agreed on the fish choices. Most of the dishes were served \"family style\". That means that you order a whole fish which the server then de-bones and divides in portions for everyone to eat.\n\nWe ordered  \"lethrini\" or Pandora/snapper fish and  \"chtapodi\" or octopus-charcoal grilled. The octopus was sweet and perfectly grilled, served with onion. If you have not tasted this amazing animal I highly recommend it. While its unusual appearance might seem alien to some, its taste will surely appeal to everyone! If the chef doesn't know, the octopus will end up having a rubbery texture, but that was not the case and the octopus was juicy and soft, grilled to perfection.\n\nWhen the lethrini arrived, Yiorgo proceeded to divide it into portions while removing the bones. We hardly found even a tiny fragment of bone on our portions, the sign of a true artist-carver. The fish itself was tender and flavorful, it took me back to childhood memories of eating fresh fish on a taverna by the beach. \n\nTo accompany the fish we also got a very juicy and tender NY steak sliced (for some of our guests who preferred meat-even though they enjoyed fish, trying it for the first time in their life!) along with Greek salad and the Milos Special (thinly sliced zucchini and eggplant friend along with kefalograviera cheese and tzatziki). The Milos Special disappeared within seconds, it was light and fried to perfection and the tzatziki was particularly enjoyable, light on the garlic and refreshing as it should be.\n\nGreek salad traditionally has feta cheese:however in the US most people confuse real feta cheese with the dried up crumbles that are sold as \"feta type\" cheese. \n\nNothing could be further from the truth, feta is supposed to be moist and depending on its origin it might be creamy and soft with a mild taste or firm with a sharper taste. The feta used on the Greek salad was true Greek feta, imported from Greece, made from the milk of cows in Epirus. Everyone at our table was a feta connoisseur (only Greeks can claim that title- sorry cheese aficionados) and they all unanimously decreed this feta is excellent.\n\nFor dessert we decided to go with the recommendation of our server (who now seemed more like a friend) Yiorgo who suggested we try baklava ice cream. Once again, Yiorgo was spot on, the ice cream was splendid and the baklava was light crispy and not overly sweet.\n\nOverall, Estiatorio Milos is exquisite. One cannot claim to have tasted Greek cuisine in Nevada (and probably many other other states) if they have not been to Milos. Exquisite food, exquisite service, exquisite people.\n\nTip: If dinner seems too expensive for you (expect to pay at least $60 per person for a sumptuous feast) you can try the lunch time menu which is very reasonably priced (around $20-25 per person)."

            "review": "Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.\n\nEstiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the \"other\" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?\n\nMilos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.\n\nGrilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.\n\nFinally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.\n\nTip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.\n\nVery good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.\n\nA restaurant that has vastly improved with time."

While Estatorio Milos possesses the expected touches one would expect from a fine dining restaurant, it is in no way pretentious and actually gives off a casual feeling only achieved by a knowledgable staff and food that really speaks for itself. Going in expecting to order the set menu, we were instead steered to the fish market experience by our waiter and it was a great choice. I think the quality of the fish is only matched by our waiter's enthusiasm, and the fish was served perfectly without too much to stand in the way of a well-cooked protein. Coupled with a greek salad and the octopus, the meal was excellent in all ways. I highly recommend this to a party looking for elevated Mediterranean flair in a well-designed yet casual atmosphere. This is not haute cuisine in all of its starched overwrought splendor. Rather, this is the place for that awesome meal as you begin to get tired of the Las Vegas flash."

For a fish house and a 225.00 fish to feed 4 people was easily the worst fish I've ever had any restaurant in the world I've been to. Fish was Rutty, stringy, dry and flavorless.

Unless it's someone else's dime I will never risk 225 on a fish here again.

            "review": "This was a last minute dining call since we were staying at the Cosmo and it was a nice change of pace to go to a Greek-seafood inspired restaurant. I had expected it to be bomb just based on the pricing and reviews I had read. There were definitely highlights that were worth while but along with that, some entrees were below my expectation. \n\nWe ordered the salmon sashimi special, the fried Milos special (which was fried zucchini, the sardines, and the tzatziki in the middle) with fried octopus which is supposed to be one of the most popular dishes there. W\n\nWe fired off with bread and olive oil which were perfect. The cool olive oil had a fruity aroma and flavor that nicely complemented the crunchy crust and warm temperature of the freshly baked bread. \n\nWe augmented our dipping session into a m\u00e9nage trios by adding garlic almond dip and feta cheese red pepper. The almond and garlic were a power couple that when together had a surprisingly delicate taste as the almond calms down the intensity of garlic and instead turns it into a buttery and subtle salty bread friend which I kept coming back for. Feta cheese and red pepper took silver but offered a nice contrast to the deliciousness of the former. This pairing fatigued my palate faster due to the richness of feta cheese but thankfully forced me to escape from the bread bowl. \n\nThe sashimi was standard high end restaurant quality but there was nothing special about it. I felt like I've had that dish a hundred times. Don't get me wrong it still tastes very good but given the high price point, there should be some more creative flair or wow factor added. \n\nThe Milos special of the Night was an large dish. Fried Zuchinni tower stacked like zenga around a pool of Tzatiki. The fried Zuchinni was standard but something I always enjoy. The tzatiki was delicious -- thick, creamy, and the perfect amount of tartness. \n\nThe grilled octopus--this dish has stood the test of time (over 3000 years).  Perfectly cooked octopus is hard to come by and I told the server that I hate octopus for that reason -- I dislike rubbery texture. Given Milos speciality with seafood and the server's reassurance I was expecting the best. However, the texture still came out rubbery. At least the marinade and sauce the octopus sat in was nice and complemented the dish well. But I still could not relocate myself from the feeling that I was gnawing on really well marinated rubber. \n\nSardines was a very delicate, salty, and fishy dish with many small bones. This really hit the spot for me and offered a nice contrast between the rubbery octopus and the heavier dipping sauces and bread. \n\nWe topped it off with Turkish coffee. It was similar to whipped Turkish coffee. This is not your average espresso, containing the thick syrup conglomerate of the coffee beans which settle heavily at the bottom. To prevent this sinking of coffee grounds, one is supposed to consume right away. However, I could not consume that much caffeine at once due to the high temperature, and found that even after the waiting, I found the coffee much too strong."

We only saw our waiter when he took our order and then it was a bunch of different assistants who couldn't be bothered with us.  When the bread was delivered the nice looking olive oil was removed from our table to give to another table so we weren't allowed to enjoy it.  The little touches you expect with a $750 tab were skipped.  What bothered me the most was before we had barely finished dessert we were invited to the bar (with 2 -16 year olds) because they wanted the table because the restaurant was backed up."

This was by far my favorite dish. At lunch this dish is only $10. Amazing deal.\n\nMediterranean Salad - fresh but very lackluster. Just chunks of cucumber and tomatoes.

Let me paint you the picture...\n\nI've been here a couple times with excellent service, friendly staff, and efficient food courses....as well as good food. \n\nToday, I noticed a HUGE difference in just receiving my WATER and BREAD.\n\nThe bread was almost FINISHED before I received water...nothing to drink.  It was also almost finished by the time my order was TAKEN.  And no, we weren't starving...it just took that long.  I'd estimate about 12-15min.\n\nThere was a HUGE difference of time between my first course and the entree.  So bad, that I noticed THREE OTHER TABLES (that arrived after me and ordered afterwards) receive their food before me!!!\n\nThis wouldn't be a huge deal if it wasn't for the fact that I had to get a MANAGER involved, and I STILL didn't have my food until they were almost FINISHED with theirs.  One of the three tables actually WAS finished with their food.  And I think most of these tables had the SAME SERVER!!!\n\nBecause my lunch was now taking almost 1.5-2hrs before I have received my entree, I ask the manager to bring my dessert WITH my entree, since I wouldn't have enough time to finish my meal.\n\nBEST PART :  While we are STILL waiting for our entrees to arrive, the server actually comes over to us, and asks how everything was....ARE YOU SERIOUS???  How can you be that HORRIBLE at your job, to NOT realize that you didn't even bring us 2 out of 3 COURSES and think we are FINISHED???  When I complain to her, she asks if I already talked to a manager...then brushes us off.  I am seriously considering walking out!!!\n\nThe food finally comes in hand via the manager.  My Lobster Pasta (which I've had twice here before now) was a bit undercooked (noodles).  I mention it to the waitress, and I left a pile of noodles on the plate when I was finished.  Pretty sure it goes to deaf ear.\n\nWhen I don't get checked on via the manager, I just ask for the check and some water to finally be refilled.  She brings over the water and takes a while to get my check.  NOW I AM STEAMING...I WANNA LEAVE THIS PLACE!!!\n\nI follow her to the damn kiosk to print my check, write a big fat $0 on the tip line (PROUDLY) and write in huge print \"THIS WAS THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED.\"  I've NEVER stiffed anyone in my entire life...not even a valet bringing a friend's car down...you're still gonna get money outta me.  But I could not FATHOM giving this DISAPPOINTMENT a dime of my money.  I dropped almost $100 for lunch for two with ice water to drink...I am not sitting at a Dennys at 3am!!!\n\nI wait for the same manager to finish talking to another group that was ALSO COMPLAINING, and hand him the checkbook with written note and walk away.  \n\nGood luck."

It had a bit of vinegar that made it a little tangy, but the sweetness of the tomatoes balanced out. \n\nMain Course:\nLobster Pasta (add $15) - you get the full lobster tail with a tomato sauce that is rich and tasty. Good to share with others because it can be overwhelming and filling. \nGrilled Seabream - They give you a whole fish, which is awesome, but the seabream does have tiny bones around the edges so eat it carefully. \n\nDessert: \nCake with Ice cream - VERY VERY SWEET. I only had one bite, couldn't handle it. \nReal Greek Yogurt - Nice and fresh, they also add a fruit puree on the top. Should have got 2 of these instead.\n\nLunch special prices is at $25 for option of three things.

You get the choice of several appetizers, a few different mains and dessert. \n\nWe ended doing one set lunch and ordering the Milos special, a must when at any Milos! It's lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and fried Greek cheese. OMG, I could eat this all day long. Plus their tzatziki is like yogurt of the gods. It's super thick and filled with cucumbers. \n\nFor the set lunch, we ended paying a lot of supplemental charges for the octopus and the lobster spaghetti but it was worth it. I think next time I'd do the dips to start instead of the octopus, but regardless everything was wonderful. \n\nThe atmosphere is bright, with some seating outside, which is so lovely for lunch. I hate feeling like you are in the basement of a casino for lunch and that is not the case at Milos. \n\nDessert was some of that thick Greek yogurt with strawberry puree. We licked the bowl. You get the picture. Have you booked a table yet?!"

The crabcakes were small but crab only and the hummus, olive appetizer very tasty. We combined our yogurt and fruit deserts and it was perfect. \n\nIt was WAY too hot that day, 104\u00b0 for the patio, but it looked inviting otherwise.

The Olive Oil they used was extraordinary, the fish as good as if it was caught right there. I actually think it was one of the best prepared pieces of fish I have had anywhere in years. We did a 3 course lunch that is only $20.12 and I would have paid 3 times that and not felt ripped off. This is UNDOUBTEDLY the best lunch value on the strip period! This restaurant which specializes in fish is worth running to. With all the talk today about local and farm to table it truly proved to me that what matters is the ingredients and the hand that prepares them. From our servers who helped us supplement our menu with some spectacular choices to our manager, Kirk Perry, every thing about this meal was stellar. By the way the room is simply stunning as well..\nMickey B\nCharleston SC"

The waiter brought the fish encased in salt to our table side and proceeded to break through the salt and deboned and served the fish to us directly. Makes my mouth water just writing this!  We have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. And you have to get the yogurt and honey for desert. Not too sweet or tart but the perfect way to end your meal."

We were a party of 8 and were seated outside, which I normally probably wouldn't have liked but it was a cooler day and fairly comfortable.  They say they are a greek restaurant and there were some typical greek items on the menu but for the most part they are a seafood restaurant.  The waiter takes you over to the kitchen and shows you all the fresh seafood they have for the day.  The prices are a bit outrageous, I paid $100+ per pound for a lobster, which did not taste that amazing, I had to ask for some butter to eat it with.  I also found their wine list a little lacking, not too many white choices (surprising for a seafood restaurant) and the bottle we originally ordered they were out of so we had to try something else.  Everything was ok, but for the cost I wasn't blown away."

You get to choose 1 of 5 items for an appetizer, 1 of 6 items for your main entree, and 1 of 2 items for dessert, although in previous years, there were  three desserts to choose from.  Because we have come here often for lunch and tried just about all their lunch specials, my favorite appetizers are the Greek Meze plate and the grilled octopus. (The octopus has a $10 surcharge.)  My favorite entrees are the salmon and the lamb chop. The salmon was tender and very fresh.  The lamb chop, which I ordered medium rare, were perfectly seasoned. ( There is a $10 surcharge for the lamb chop.)  The portion is small, but it is perfect for lunch. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas for lunch."

We got there right as they were opening for dinner.  We had no reservation but were seated immediately.  There is a small bar area and a larger dining area.  Very modern and classy design with minimal artwork and white tablecloths.  There is an outdoor seating balcony area but they weren't seating there at the time.  It was a little more formal inside than I was expecting.  I'm glad we were eating early, since I was wearing jeans and a collared shirt.  The kitchen is open and between the kitchen and the seating area is the \"market\".  They have all their vegetable and fruits piled up and larger are full ice with all their fresh fish and seafood on display.  The people sitting next us ordered a whole fish to share and were walked over to pick out the specific fish they wanted.  Pretty cool.  Anyway, back to our meal.  I never know how division of labor works at these restaurants.  We had multiple waiters.  I guess one was an assistant and the other is the main waiter.  The first guy, he was a little quiet and I didn't catch his name, took our drink orders.  We ordered glasses of a very nice Greek Sauvingnon Blanc.  After two glasses each, we should've just ordered the bottle.  Go figure.   Kevin was our main waiter and he was great.  Very friendly and informative.  We told him we were just looking for something light and thinking about going with just a few appetizers.  We were wondering if he'd be put off by that, but he was totally cool and told us that when he eats there himself he usually just orders the apps.  He made some great recommendations.  Based on his advice we went with the Milos Special which is very thin slices of eggplant and zucchini, that are lightly breaded and fried.  They come all piled up in a beehive shape with a fork in the middle.  You spin the fork around and they all kind of topple out and there's tzatziki sauce in the middle.  This is not your average gyro sauce that you end up tasting the rest of the day.  It's very light and absolutely delicious.  The veggies were so lightly fried they never felt heavy.  Beats out chips any day!  It also comes with pieces of white cheese that you eat warm.  An excellent app.  Our second app was the charred octopus (another Kevin recommendation).  It comes with capers and a vinagrette.  This is the first time I've had octopus that wasn't in ceviche.  I didn't know what to expect.  It was extremely tender and delicious.  The charred flavor is just right and works perfectly.  We will definitely be back at some point to try a full meal."

The food is delicious but not too heavy... I left satiated and not feeling like I would explode (like I do at a lot of restaurants here... not that I'm complaining!)\n\nMy friend and I showed up around noon without reservations and were seated promptly on the terrace.  It was so beautifully decorated, you almost felt like you were in a little taverna in Greece and not on the The Strip.  The service was very attentive yet not intrusive.  For the appetizer, I had the Greek Meze Plate which had a selection of tzatziki, some sort of hummus-type spread, and a red-pepper spread with pita triangles, olives, and cheese.  Absolutely perfect in every way.  My friend had the tomato and feta salad which she enjoyed as well.  We both had the shrimp dish which was served with tomato sauce and feta with cous cous.  Loved this as well.  For dessert my friend had the fresh fruit plate (which honestly looked a little disappointing but that's just me) and I had the yogurt martini which was the smoothest greek yogurt I've ever had with a berry sauce on top.  Perfect end to the meal.\n\nHonestly, this was one of the best meals I had on the Las Vegas strip and one of the most delicious.  I will DEFINITELY come back to eat here again... in fact I'm thinking about going there again for lunch tomorrow!  Yes, it was that awesome!"

We have been to Greece twice, so we have a pretty good sense for what the real thing should taste like, and this place amazing in terms of the food.  The grilled octopus appetizer was to die for.  However, the service was painfully slow, hence only the 3 stars.  Our waiter's excuse that he was dealing with a larger party was pretty lame, considering the $240 bill for two (no dessert, and only 2 glasses of wine).  It took 2 hours to get our food. We were so tired of sitting and waiting that we skipped the dessert.  Beware of the market price of the daily fish.  Ours was $98, for two, which they don't tell you up front, so you might want to ask in advance.  Also, the wine pours were a bit skimpy for the $16 per glass price."

I would be hard-pressed to find better bang for your buck, at the Cosmo no less.\n\nThere are upgrades available, costing more, but i went with the original options.  I started with the palte of olives, cheese, and other Greek foods, then went with the Salmon, and finished with the yogurt.  The plate was a great starter, along with the complimentary bread.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and the accompnaied anchovies were great to provide some saltiness to the dish.  The yogurt was finally a great ending, tasting more creamy and rich than anticipated.\n\nOverall, this is a must try if on the strip during lunch."

But overall, this is a very good deal, especially if you want seafood that is not overcooked.\n\nI ordered their grilled octopus, grilled Mediterranean sea bass, and a yogurt martini. Very filling meal indeed. The grilled octopus had a light charcoal flavor mixed in with some sauteed onions. The tentacle pieces did not have a rubbery texture where I think I'm chewing on plastic. It might be a bland dish if you're the type to prefer bold flavors. But as an appetizer, it does its job for making you want more of their foods. It's not overwhelming since it's only the first course. Perfect size to share if you're dining with one or two other. \n\nMy sea bass was much more flavorful, just as I expected. A filet of sea bass grilled with lemon sauce. The ends of the fish can be a bit more tough from overcooking, but the inner parts were so soft, you can feel pieces of the fish as your tongue separates it layer by layer. The skin was grilled to a perfect crisp and soaks up the lemon sauce. If you took a bite with both the skin and the meat, you have like two sets of sensations going on in your mouth. I haven't had good seafood like this in a long while. The sauce was a bit too much for my broccoli on the side though, a bit too salty for my taste. \n\nMy dessert ended my meal with a grin. It is my first time trying Greek yogurt. I never knew what the hype is all about. It is very aromatic and filling. Although the dessert was served in a martini glass, the heavy yogurt will definitely fill in all the gaps. If you're the type to prefer a less sweet dessert, this will be a good choice. Very tarty, and arguably healthy (depends on how much you ate altogether.) I'm definitely coming back for more!\n\nLastly, I do want to mention to the beer lovers, do try their Hillas beer. I'm an IPA person, huge fan of aromatic undertones. This beer is not an IPA, not heavy or too bitter, but it does have some floral notes. Definitely give it a try!\n\nService was great. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Doesn't get pushy in making us order certain things. Kind of good looking too, so that boosted my appetite. They have outdoor seating as well as indoors. I wouldn't suggest outdoors during late spring/early summer for lunch because it is just burning outside. It's very spacious inside, with a nice couch surrounding the main dining room. You can somehow see the kitchen in the corner (we were seated right in front of it, which is great to watch). The only complaint I have is our table. The actual table was not leveled, so either my friend leaned one way or my feet were placed in certain ways, we might tip it over or something. Had to be very careful throughout the entire meal."

We had done that the night before at Okada, which was 5 star awesome as usual.\n\nFirst, the service was horrible --- it took forever to get anybody's attention, our drinks, the appetizers or the meal.\n\nSecond, this place is $$$.  There were just 5 choices for entrees, all $48+.  There was lobster ravioli for 2 for $120, market price fish, and 3 meat entrees, all $48-$68.  \n\nFor wine, there were maybe 2-3 options for red below $100.  We ordered the $60 Duckhorn Merlot and the waiter sneered \"that is a great value choice, sir.\"  It was insulting to hear that from him.\n\nThe appetizers were OK (after 45 minutes when they finally came). \n\nWe ordered the lobster pasta.  3 of the 4 of us honestly felt sick to our stomachs afterwards, nauseous.  \n\nAnyway, there you have it.  If your life's desire is to go to Milos, go ahead.  Otherwise, give them some time to get this place up to par.  There are way too many other good restaurants in Vegas.\n\nMaybe the fish is great.

I feel bad recommending it to my friends because of this . . . but there is a certain combination that is simply among the best food that I have every eaten anywhere in the world. And that is saying a lot. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants around. Ok, here is the absolutely no-risk lineup:  \n\nFirst, skip the table bread. It is nothing special and you do NOT want to get filled up with bread. \n\nSecond, order the Milos Special. Unbelievable. This easily serves 3-4 at the table. It is reminiscent of chips and dip BUT blessed by the Greek Gods. Savory fried zucchini and eggplant chisp with with tzatziki and a fried Greek cheese. You cannot stop eating it. Truly fantastic. \n\nThird, order the Greek Salad. Sounds fairly pedestrian. It is not. It is exquisite. I don't know how else to describe it. Las Vegas weekly calls it \"simple perfection\" and I cannot disagree. I promise you that you will rave about it. My wife and I split it because we have more menu items coming. \n\nFourth, order the lamb. People call us crazy when we do that. Milos is, after all, known for their remarkable seafood. And we have eaten widely and happily among the seafood selection until . . . blam, we tried the lamb one day. Heaven. Since that moment, we have never ordered another main entre. And everyone I have cajoled and begged into trying it has blessed my name forever more. It is the most succulent cut of meat that you can eat. Perfectly seasoned bliss. Every bite. It is impossible to oversell the thing.  \n\nFinally, if you have sat for awhile and have some room for dessert: I recommend \"The Real Greek Yogurt\" selection. It is not for everyone. It is a wonderful heavy and tart Greek Yogurt offset with honey and walnuts. The contrasting flavors is delicious to me. But not everyone is overcome like I am with it. And, honestly, none of the desserts on the same scale as the three items I recommend above. \n\nIn summary, I swear to you that if you order: (1) Milos Special; (2) Greek Salad and (3) Lamb, you will have one of the best dinners you have ever had in your life. I have made that same boast to several friends and family members when we have gone there and when the dust cleared, they all agreed with me. It is something to rave about."

Decided to try their 3 course lunch menu for $25.  \nSeriously, $25 for 3-course lunch is one of the best decisions I've ever made!  \n\nThe ambiance of this place is amazing in the day with plenty of lighting from the outside.  You get a nice view of the strip, and I believe there is terrace seating as well.  You are welcomed with a bunch of gigantic pottery to the left when you walk in.  Very unique kind of feel.  \n\nI started my awesome $25 3-course meal with the Canadian Classic, which is a bagel with smoked salmon on top, capers, and some cream cheese.  My smoked salmon was orange (not red), which is perfect!  It had the right amount of smokiness and saltiness in it.  The salmon goes great with capers.  \n\nAlso almost forgot to mention that your table comes with grilled bread and olive oil.  The bread I think is grilled on the same grill as the fish, so you can kind of taste a hint of it (which is great)!  Warm, soft, bread dipped in olive oil...yum!\n\nWith the bread and Canadian Classic, I was almost full, but I couldn't give up!  I had a whole fish and cake coming up!\n\nSecond course was the main dish: a whole white sea bream with olive oil, lemon, and capers.  The fish was so tender and so full of flavor.  The capers....fish is amazing with capers!  I was just about full before I got my fish, but it was so juicy and tasty that I ate the whole thing!\n\nLast, I got some Greek ice cream on a slice of pecan pie.  The scoop of ice cream and the slice of cake was smaller than most restaurants, but I was okay with it because I was so stuffed already.  That was amazing as well.  Just the right amount of sweetness. \n\nI'm planning on coming here for dinner in the near future."

This is truly as good as it gets!!!\n\nWe were tired after a long day of traveling on essentially flying buses (you know what I mean) crammed with passengers and full of many delays. When we finally got to Vegas, we were ready for a delicious meal.\n\nWe decided to sit on the outdoor patio with the heat lamps. It was awesome!! Excellent ambient temperature and relaxing atmosphere! \n\nThe waitstaff team was exceptional. I believe Moses was our main server. He was attentive, accommodating, and recommended the best items. \n\nOk, so onto the food. I really wish I could have sampled every single dish on the menu! Here's a list of what we had:\n\n-Warm Bread and Imported Style Olive Oil: wow! Crunchy, crispy, and freshly baked bread served with light, earthy imported olive oil!!!\n\n-Mushroom appetizer: simple, but oohh so flavorful, delicious, light, and delectable! The oyster mushrooms were seriously to die for.\n\n-Garden salad: excellent dressing!! Light, fruity, and delicious! \n\n-Calamari: fried to perfection!\n\n-Fried Potatoes: the herb seasoning and thick cut wedges were outstanding. \n\n-Salmon: Wow, when they say fresh, fluffy, and buttery, they really mean it! Succulent, juicy fish with some crisp asparagus underneath. \n\n-Flourless Chocolate Cake: EXTREMELY Rich, but absolutely delectable!!!!! I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but this cake is worth it. \n\nOverall, a stelar experience!!! A must stop in Vegas!"

Their lunch combo with 3-courses for $25 is hard to beat, even with the $10 surcharge on the octopus.\n\nWe got two identical lunch sets, with just dessert being different.  I had the Them Apples cocktail which was like a spicy apple martini - sweet and fruity.\n\nThe octopus appetizer was perfection - charcoal grilled and so amazingly juicy and tender it must have been massaged prior to cooking.  The simple preparation of capers and lemons elevated the dish.  Definitely worth the surcharge!\n\nFor entree, we got the grilled Mediterranean seabass which had a similar preparation.  Simple and good - the fish was cooked perfectly and if its a tad oily, its a good thing since its high-quality EVOO probably.  The broccoli florets were also cooked well and tender.\n\nDessert is where we had some minor dings.  My Real Greek Yogurt was served with raspberry sauce in a martini glass that was pretty good.  Very thick and slightly tart - definitely not the types from Costco!  I actually liked mine.  My wife's walnut cake was slightly too firm - would have been better warmed.\n\nWe will likely come here in the future to try their other offerings.  I liked how you can have healthy, tasty cuisine in Vegas!  The octopus alone was our Opa moment after the first bite."

Some highs, some lows.\n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. It's bright and inviting. The view outside the windows is awesome. I would think this place would be quite romantic at nighttime, with all the lights of the Strip beaming in. \n\nA buddy of mine was in town and wanted to go to the Cosmo for lunch. The three-course lunch menu for $20.12 won us over. Our server was a sweetheart and explained the menu thoroughly since it was our first time there. Needless to say, we were excited - grumbling tummies and all. \n\nMy first course was the lox and bagel. Dainty, yet satisfying. Nothing too exciting here,  though. My buddy and boyfriend both ordered the scallop skewers. These were really good - fresh, plump and juicy. \n\nI ordered the jumbo shrimp with couscous for my main course. This was very good. I loved the seasoning on the shrimp and the couscous was cooked to perfection. I wanted to lick my plate when I was done for some more. My boyfriend ordered the sea bass which was delicious as well. The sea bass was presented as a whole filet in which he was advised to eat from the tail up. My buddy ordered the salmon with a side of broccoli. I didn't get to taste this, but it looked alright. \n\nI was really disappointed in the desserts. My buddy and I ordered the walnut cake. The cake itself was really heavy and tasted like over-sweetened, heavy baklava. Don't get me wrong, I love baklava. But this cake was too much. On top of that, the cake had a spoonful of a ginger-type ice cream. This was terrible. I thought it tasted like fancy cardboard. My boyfriend got the fruit plate. Don't have much to say here because it was simply just a plateful of seasonal fruit. I saw that the people around us had some type of yogurt parfait. That looked tasty. I really wished I had gotten that instead of the walnut cake. \n\nPerhaps my expectations were too high for this place. But I'm willing to go back one of these days for dinner and try it again."

Some selections have an up charge, and they are well worth it.\n\nThe room is beautiful!  It's open but still feels cozy.  I like the varying levels of the walkways to the tables, the dark wood ceiling beams, and light stone on the pillars.  We offered a choice of sitting outside on the patio or inside.  The patio was a just a bit too chilly, so we opted for inside.\n\nI started with the Greek plate of tzatziki, cheese, kalamata olive, cherry tomato, tamara, and pita bread.  I was hesitant of the tamara, since it's made with fish roe, but it was by no means fishy and was really pleasant, especially when combined with a caper.  The tzatziki was wonderful!  Smooth, with just a hint of garlic and small diced cucumber as well as cucumber served on the side.  The meze plate was served with a chardonnay, and it paired nicely with the dips and pita bread.\n\nFor my second course I chose the lamb chops (extra $10) served with broccoli and french fries.  They were incredibly tender, juicy, seasoned perfectly and everyone at the table loved them.  The broccoli and the french fries were a nice surprise - a very delicate taste to the broccoli (was it a hint of lemon? If so, it was so light that it was a beautiful complement without overpowering) and perfectly cooked french fries also with a delicate sprinkle of herb (perhaps thyme?).  This course was served was a Greek Merlot.  That was fun!  I've never had a Greek Merlot, and it paired nicely with the lamb.\n\nFor dessert I chose the Greek yogurt services with raspberries and a slight drizzle of raspberry sauce.  I was expecting a bitter taste, but it instead had a kiss, just a hint, of sweetness.\n\nBeautiful setting, very good food, and service was what I expected.  Nicely done!"

I dont understand why as we were dressed quite nice. The atmospehere was cold and dead. It was not lively at all. The menu varied and it is only getting 3 stars because of how extensive their fish menu is (most of it is not on the menu because it is so fresh). We each had one glass of wine and for two people the bill was $300. We had one starter, he ordered one fish and I had three small langoustine. We dine at the most trendy/expensive restaurants in Miami where the bill has been a maximum of $250 and thats only due to several drinks. This restaurant is soooo overpriced for what you get. The fish was OK but for that price I would expect to fall out of my chair from the mind-blowing taste. It is not worth the money. I do understand its probably pretty pricy to fly fish from all over the world but still, too expensive. Go next door to Jaleo. The ambiance and food is MUCH better and far less expensive."

But even if the food is delicious, poor or rude service can absolutely ruin a restaurant.\n\nI found this restaurant extremely unwelcoming. I stayed at the Cosmo while in town for a conference and ventured in for a solo lunch between meetings. Milos caters to a very upper class crowd. One group of men walked in wearing casual clothes and everyone stared. It was noon. On a Wednesday. It's Vegas. Come on, maybe they just won it big at the blackjack table.\n \nThe girls at reception were aloof, and the server was so pretentious I almost screamed. The only people in the restaurant who smiled and used manners were the gentlemen who politely bussed the tables.\n\nThe lunch menu consists of three courses. Under $25 is a great price considering the food is off-the-boat fresh, but the options are extremely limited and I left a little hungry. The 3 dips on the meze plate were good, but you only get a disappointing tablespoon worth of each. I ordered a glass of house Chardonnay, which turned out to be $18.\n\nThe flavor/freshness of the food was outstanding, but the arrogant staff ruined my impression of the place."

            "review": "My husband and I ate lunch here on a Tuesday while in Vegas in December 2015. Because of the high ratings and the octopus on the menu, I probably would have selected this restaurant regardless, but we were fortunate enough to take advantage of their great lunch prix fixe menu. During weekdays, for only about $25, you can get a three-course meal. \n\nI made reservations that same morning via OpenTable for noon, right when they open. We arrived right around noon and were seated right away. In my opinion, a restaurant doesn't need beautiful decor to get a high rating (I enjoy inexpensive hole-in-the-wall spots too), but if it does, it's just a bonus. Estiatorio Milos, in the Cosmopolitan, is a lovely spot with stylish, tasteful decor. The interior is charming and the outdoor patio looked beautiful as well. The restaurant has plenty of glass windows, so during the day it was full of natural light. \n\nMy primary reason for selecting it was the grilled octopus on the menu, so of course that was one of our selections. From the prix fixe menu, we chose:\n\nGrilled octopus (extra $10) appetizer- the octopus, which is fresh like all of their seafood, was delicious. It was perfectly cooked, with no hint of toughness that is so common with octopus and squid preparation, and some of the pieces had a nice char from the grill. It was only lightly seasoned so as to not overwhelm the flavor of the octopus itself. The portion size was decent as well. \n\nTomato & feta salad- this was probably the best version of Greek salad I've had. The pieces of feta were in large chunks rather than smaller pieces and the feta itself was a good quality. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe with actual flavor and the seasoning on this salad was great. \n\nGrilled sea bass (entree)- the portion was very generous and more than enough for one person. Like the octopus, the fish was expertly grilled and had a touch of olive oil along with capers. It was served with broccoli that was cooked until just tender but still crisp.\n\nShrimp saganaki (entree)- I preferred the sea bass because I'm not a huge fan of tomato-based entrees, but that's just my preference. The shrimp were of a good size and cooked well, and served with tasty cous cous on the side. \n\nGreek yogurt (dessert)- this was the creamiest and best-tasting Greek yogurt we've ever had. Apparently they make it in house and the quality is apparent. I'm not generally a fan of things like yogurt for dessert (I ordered the cake), but this yogurt was amazing! It was served with berries. \n\nKaridopita (dessert)- Greek walnut cake served with ice cream. I liked the flavors but felt the execution wasn't quite there. The cake was served with a syrup but the portions that didn't get syrup were quite dry. I have a feeling it was not supposed to be this dry. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal and I can't wait to visit again when I'm in Vegas. I thought the service was excellent and we liked being able to watch the kitchen antics from our table. Other reviewers had issues with the supplementary charge on the prix fixe menu but I didn't mind; for one thing, it's right on their menu and our waiter was very good about mentioning the additional charge. The octopus was well worth the extra dollars and overall, the meal was still a great value."

The steak was so-so at best and doesn't even begin to compare to what you can get at a steakhouse for a similar price.  Several steaks were way over-cooked... in my case, I ordered a medium rare and received what my server called a medium well (I am pretty sure it was well done).  To top that off, our captain gave some of us crap about sending the steak back.  When my new steak arrived, it was cooked as ordered. However, all of my sides were missing and I only received them after I finished the steak.  Fish was good.  About 8 of us got the same desert. It was some kind of pie with ice cream flavor that I've never heard of before.  Waiter stated that the ice cream is made of some kind of tree bark and is very expensive. What he forgot to mention is that it is also absolutely disgusting and completely not eatable.   None of us ended up eating more than one spoonful.  Wine was good.  Can't see myself coming back."

The sea bass was good however, the salmon encountered a few complications. The first time salmon was served to me it had a hair in the salmon. The second time salmon was served to me it was under cooked. In my opinion it seemed that the cook in the back tried to cook the salmon quickly by turning up the heat at the end so as to rush the cooking process. Also, the first piece was twice the size of the second piece. In fairness to the restaurant my meal was comped and an additional 15% was taken off the bill. We had desserts, the Wife had mixed fruits (pineapple, slice of blood orange, a few raspberries, a few black berries, half a strawberry), This was the prefix menu which cost $22.13 per person.

For spending over $100 each, our party of 3 expected to be blown away and we were left feeling...meh.  The first thing you should know if planning to go here and plan on having fish, you will be buying a whole fish.  Our 1 fish, served family style, was $120.  Perhaps that included the fish's airfare from Greece!?  I agree with other reviewers about the upsell tactics.  We also shared a ribeye which was very ordinary.  The Milos Special appetizer was amazing and delicious, as was the grilled bread and olive oil.  The lunch special sounds like the way to go here if you want to try this place out.  I will say that the servers were outstanding so kudos on that."

Get the lavraki- little sea bass was delicious. I also got the yogurt martini- a bit tart & refreshing Greek yogurt. My friend's pork chop was good, but she thought her walnut dessert was a little too sweet. The coffee was fine; in order for me to judge a restaurant as good, it must serve good coffee.

            "review": "This is a fun place for an epic meal!  Over a year ago, Eric R. and I came here for the $20.12 lunch, both getting suckered into the supplement (me for the octopus, him for the crab cake).  We thought it was good but figured dinner here would be out of reach.  Yesterday I get a call from him around 3 PM asking if I wanted to have dinner here with his uncle.  Both of us have a lot of really cool uncles who seem to visit Vegas often and treat us to nice dinners.  I would never turn this down!  Reservations were set for 8 which gave me plenty of time to run errands after work.\n\nWe arrived fashionably at 8:04 and were seated immediately.  Four of us dined without abandon.  We all had cocktails - I tasted the cucumber-based \"In the Know\" and the apple one, but opted for the \"Sticky Rice\" with tanqueray, plum preserves, and jasmine syrup.  It sounded me-ish and it was delicious.  We were given grilled bread and a fruity olive oil to start.  Then the ordering commenced.  The server said due to the east coast weather, they were limited on types of fish and oysters and were out of the octopus (gasp) and sardines.  Bummer!\n\nFirst, we opted for apps only.  Eric R. and I shared the Raw bar tasting, which normally has 4 types of fish but due to this shortage it had 3.  It included bigeye tuna with YUZU kosho!!!, salmon with fresno chile and shallot, and some white fish that ended up being quite excellent considering I do not often get white fish sashimi.  I also ordered 3 oysters from Washington state, and we got the grilled shrimp app with endive salad.  The other guests ordered the mushroom side as an app and so I tried abalone, trumpet, and shiitakes and they were great of course.  Eric R. also got taramasalata which was nothing like any I have had before - the roe was not visible, and Eric thought it tasted and looked like hummus (to me the taste was closer to taramasalata) but they did not give us anything to eat it with for probably 20 minutes - we had to ask for bread from 3 different people, and it was the least interesting thing to eat on the table.\n\nNext, we ordered Greek salads - everyone spotted the beautiful Canadian (hah) tomatoes near the bar and the salads are just tomatoes, feta, cucumber, red onion, olive, and green pepper - no lettuce.  Eric R. and I split one and I ended up with leftovers for today which I am eating now, yum!  We ordered the whole opakapaka for the table prepared simply with olive oil and lemon and had the server split it tableside.  It was delicate and tasty, and I could only eat half.  I tried the fish cheek which was cool.\n\nFor sides, we got chard, broccoli, roasted beets, and sweet onions.  I was the only beet eater so I got to take those home too.  The rest of the sides were okay.  No room for dessert!  Because I am local, I am fortunate enough to take the delicious extra food home which I am sure many tourists do not do.  This meal was delicious from start to finish which service pretty personable throughout.  The sticky rice cocktail was also excellent.\n\nIf I return, I still would get octopus if it were available again.  This was likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, so I am glad it was delicious, fun, and with generous family!"

It was mostly tomatoes and cucumbers with a very small amount of feta cheese. When we asked for a few more olives (there were literally 2 olives in the salad) the waiter brought us an entire side order of olives and charged us extra. It's very obvious this restaurant is not very generous and is looking for every way to turn a coin. The ambiance and location is beautiful but the prices do not match the experience."

The French fries it came with had about 10 times the normal amount of salt. I ordered a fish called bream and I could only eat a few bites. It was soaked in butter and covered in capers (which the menu did not state) and once again it was too salty to choke down. The brocoli was over salted as well. I generally love sea salt....but this was crazy over done. I guess the chef must have been back there getting his frustrations out. The tomato salad was excellent and the service was good.

It seems that they raise the prices every January one penny (the nerve!) to keep up with inflation. So if you want to take advantage of this deal, you have to get there....Now!\n Ok. Here's the deal. You get one appetizer one entree and dessert for a mere 20 dollars and 12 cents at a high end restaurant. Where else can you do that? But I have to warn you. If you're not careful you may find yourself  traveling too far into the future.\nFor 1000 years more you can go for the grilled octopus but you won't regret it. It was        \"octopussylicious!\" and for another few more years, lets say 1500, you can enjoy a delicious Nova Scotian lobster pasta. I couldn't tell if it was really Nova Scotian but I didn't really care, I wasn't going to sleep with it anyways. The trick is (and very hard if I may add) is to stay in 2012 to enjoy the deal. I traveled too far into the future. By the time I realized it I was somewhere around 4512, I had to call Scotty to bean me up, but all I can say is that food in the future is very delicious, I enjoyed every bite of it.\n  The service? Couldn't be better, I just wish they wouldn't had enticed me to time travel so far into the future. nonetheless, I still think it was a great deal.\n I can't wait to go back..............in time! \n  \n# deal of the year\n#great food\n#great service\n#great ambiance\n                         ^ useful information."

I know $20 sounds like an expensive lunch, but it is an absolute steal-especially on the strip where a burger and fries will put you at $20 like no one's business. For the special you get a three-course meal worthy of the fine dining tag. The mediterranean seabass is the way to go. I've been to Greece, this is as authentic as it gets us. I think they fly in some of their fish directly, so there you go. The sauce is simple, elegant, and basically perfect. Their octopus is also very excellent, as are their lamb chops and fries. Although if you're really hungry, the lamb chops are not the biggest portion. \nFor desert, the special yogurt and honey is a must try. I know yogurt and honey doesn't sound like much to get excited about. But trust me it is. The honey is specially made and it is the best honey I've ever had.

These \"imported\" fish had price tags of $59 per lb. for fish that is around $22 per lb in the stores, but thats okay, its Vegas and you expect excellence for that price ... right ??\n\nI then asked, how fresh the fish was? After all, isn't Freshness paramount for fish? They said is was shipped in from Greece about 72 hours ago. Translated around 3-5 days in reality. So, $60 per lb of fish thats not fresh ?? mmmm... something fishy here!!\n\nLong story short... typical hyped up Las Vegas restaurant, with average cooking skill sets. Virtually every dish tasted like it had buckets of salt on it... awful and not a sign of a good chef if they had to drown their food in salt.\n\nTwo people had lamb chops (2 per on the plate). For $60 you would expect to have a little meat on each chop. Well... they were about 80% fat and grisle !!!\n\nI ordered grilled octopus and it came out over cooked and gave it back. Was so disgusted at that point, just paid the bill .... all $600 of it !! This story is very common with Las Vegas restaurants. All flash... and mediocre cooking at best.

The food is always top-notch matched by immaculate presentation and service to boot! If you can get a table it's a no-brainer during your stay in Vegas."

Hint: Then don't make a noon reservation available if you can't even be ready by noon. When the place was officially open, they didn't even seat us first. They let other people that didn't have reservations be seated first, then decided to seat us. Not cool. \n\nWe of course had the pre-fix lunch for $25.15/person. It's not like there's any other choice. Oh, and the other things on the menu that seem like it could actually taste good are an additional $10.00. Really?!?! Then why show us??\n\nWhat I chose (without having to add additional $10.00 here or there):\nAppetizer: Greek Meze Plate - Tarma, Tzatziki, Salami manor cheese, olives & cherry tomatoes\nMain Course: Corade Royale - grilled Mediterranean Sea Bream\nDessert: Karidopita with kaimaki ice cream\n\nLet's just say I could only enjoy the freshness of the Corade Royale. Everything else I couldn't really eat and did not enjoy the taste at all. Maybe it's because I'm no Greek cuisine connoisseur, but I only enjoyed the entree...overall, disappointed in their service and menu, hence making my experience and recommendation a one star (thank goodness the entree was good)."

No matter: I make it to this gorgeous and glorious, civilized and perfect haven for delicious food. \n\nI've had many different waiters here and all are outstanding, but it is definitely IVAN on this trip to made my visit most special. Stuck alone and exhausted during a loud and intense convention, I came scrappy and overheated with suitcase in hand, having traversed the annoyingly trendy Cosmopolitan to reach Milos on the third floor, east tower. But worth every step. \n\nI hid in the bar area, at a little round table, getting some work done and enjoying the $49 Four course dinner.. WOW!! But, like an absolute PIG I had to order the tower of eggplant and zucchini. This thing is a revelation. Forgo the bread and get this for the table. \n\nIvan was my white aproned hero and he made me feel comfortable and welcome. Wrapped in a friendly smile he was a total professional, a psychic really - coming to my aid when my table was about to be invaded by teetering bar butts slowly encroaching inches above my candle. He arrived instantly and moved me to the corner table, averting a candle butt burning. \n\nLOVE this place."

Everything was beautiful. Beautifully decorated restroom, outdoor dinning space (I recommend sitting out here when the weather is nice. It's covered but we didn't know that and expected to be straight outside), dining space, which are all sadly ruined by the display of seafood and produce on ice. It honestly made me feel as if I was in the supermarket.. There are two displays on two sides of the restaurant. \n\nYou get a free bread basket in the beginning, however they were not warm. Disappointing but it's okay. Nice hardy chunks of bread. \n\nFor my appetizer, I chose the Hortopita? I think it was. It's a spinach item with a filo dough crust. I loveddd this item, but I'm also a sucker for filo dough and any sort of pastries. It was a bit greasy, however you should still get this! \n\nFor my entree, I chose the salmon dish. You can tell the salmon was HUGE originally but they only give you half of the salmon steak. It was paired with gigantic pieces of broccoli, this I did not enjoy. It was advertised as \"steamed vegetableS\", not vegetable. The salmon itself was delicious, nicely seasoned and cooked. \n\nFor my dessert, I chose the Greek yogurt. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't wow me either... \n\nMy friends and I shared appetizers, which I will list below. \n\nTomato salad. Nothing special again, but still good. You get huge chunks of tomato and cucumber on a bed of olive oil. The feta cheese was a nice pairing.\n\nGreek meze plate. Get this and ask for extra pita bread. They only give you 4? Small triangles. My most favorite was tzatziki, least was the red bell pepper one.\n\nLamb chop. Cooked well, two small chops of lamb. Not much meat if you do not like to eat fat. Came with fries. I love fries. Hard to mess up on those unless they are cold. This also came with giant pieces of broccoli. \n\nShrimp saganaki. My friend was like \"this is it?\" When it came out. Just a small portion of couscous and a few shrimp in tomato sauce..\n\nIce cream dish. You would expect a bowl of Icecream like the Greek yogurt, but you get a SMALL cake and a dollop of icecream. The cake was way too gingery on top of that. \n\nWould I come back? Only if someone else chose it and I had zero say. No items would draw me back besides for maybe sitting outside."

The owner sent us some scrumptious items. My favorites:\n\n-Octopus: it's made very well here. I've had it at other high-end Greek restaurants but it was often too chewy for my taste\n-Tuna Sashimi: it had dill on it, which I really dislike, but the way they served it was divine. Super fresh\n-Calamari: Hands down the BEST I've ever had anywhere. It's a bold \nstatement but it's so true. I'm not even a big fan of calamari but I loved this dish\n-Greek salad: It's made differently here with no lettuce. Just big chunks of heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and olives. Loved it.\n\nThey have a lunch special here which is a must if you are in the area. $20 for a 3-course meal at a fine dining spot is a steal."

As a result, I had high hopes for the restaurant in Las Vegas. I was not let down.\n\nThe food was just as good in Las Vegas as NYC. Indeed, the menu is generally the same. What's more, the wait staff was superb. (See my NYC review of Milos to see what it was up against.) \n\nWe started with an appetizer. the Milos special (Lightly fried zucchini & eggplant with tzatziki & kefalograviera cheese).  I was impressed with the fried zucchini, which was cut paper thin and resembled a potato chip. It was great. \n\nWe followed that with tomato salad, which consists of feta cheese, seasoned with Greek herbs & extra virgin olive oil. The tomato salad is always outstanding at the NYC location and it was no different here.\n\nFinally, we had the tuna tartare before waiting for our main courses. The tuna tartare was very good. \n\nFor our main courses, we ordered the Fakri (snapper) and the New York strip. \n\nThe snapper, which was $62 a pound, was fresh and plentiful (three of us shared it). One of our dinner mates -- there were three of us -- ate all of the fish we put in front of him. That's saying something, especially because he doesn't like fish. \n\nThe strip was cooked perfectly. My only nit is that it was a little salty. When you're paying top prices, you look for the slightest imperfections. That's my one complaint for the night. Still, it was pretty dang good. \n\nFor dessert, we had the yogurt (goats milk yogurt) with honey. I've had this many times at the NYC location. It tasted exactly the same. A+. \n\nThe ambiance was relaxed and the wait staff was attentive. We had a great overall experience. \n\nThe cost for three of us, including tip, was $460."

It was simple but delicious. The filet and rib eye were a force to be reckoned with. Almost as good as CUT. The whole fish baked in rock salt was suppose to be the star of the night but I thought it was just OK. Bread service kinda sucked lol"

The concept is high end Mediterranean seafood... Truly amazing. They encourage \"family style\" or sharing for everyone. We started off with the \"Milos Special\" which is pan-fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki sauce and this \"saganaki\" cheese around the outside. Next we had the Most-amazing Octopus ever. The meal ended perfectly with a salt-crusted Sea Bass that was one of the best fish I've ever had. It was complimented perfectly with a Greek tomato salad, that our server recommended with it. The experience ended with Baklava and Yogurt with Honey on top.\n\nOverall I would say the entire experience was a knockout! The new concept is exciting, even for Vegas. The service was great and so was the ambiance.\n\nReading the reviews below it seems like they have mad the necessary adjustments in service. The prices are fairly high but on-par for the rest of Vegas. After all they do fly in the fish everyday from Greece!"

But by far, this is one of my favorite dining experiences on the Strip. And that's saying a lot!\n\nFOOD:\n-------\nThe pre-fixe lunch menu is a straight up steal at $25.15 for your choice of appetizer, main course, and dessert. And mind you, they're not skimping on the portions either. Here's what we ordered:\n \nAPPETIZERS:\n\n** Fresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake ($10 supplementary) - So flavorful and juicy! And paired well with the marinated navy beans and mustard emulsion. Definitely a great choice.\n\n** Grilled Octopus appetizer ($10 supplementary) - My friend ordered this. I'd never wanted to try octopus before (usually stay away from seafood with a rubbery texture) but it smelled so good I couldn't resist. Prepared to sashimi quality and charcoal-broiled, the octopus was delicious. I don't know if I'll be able to eat it anywhere else!\n\nMAIN COURSES:\n\n** Lavraki - You get an entire grilled Mediterranean bass. This blew my mind. I was heading to the airport directly after lunch, so I had to eat the entire portion. Which wasn't a bad thing because it tasted amaaaazing.\n\n** Shetland Island Organic Salmon with steamed vegetables - My friend ordered this dish and it was also a great choice. I usually don't order salmon in restaurants as a rule, but this one was just right. Not dry at all and very flavorful.\n\nDESSERT:\n\n** Karidopita with kaimaki ice cream - What a happy ending to this meal! Absolutely wonderful with a great texture, not too sweet, and topped with ice cream. What more could you want?!\n\n** The Real Greek Yogurt - A nice, light dessert with berries. Not as sour as I expected. Yum!\n\nSERVICE/AMBIANCE:\n---------------------\nWait staff was extremely professional and treated us just like everyone else, even though we were the only ones dressed very casually since we were soon airport-bound. Very attentive just as you'd expect from a $$$$ establishment. Very pleased with the service.\n\nThe ambiance is just gorgeous. It gives you the fine ding experience while also adding a cultural flair with the seafood market theme and beautiful Greek decor.\n\nTIP: Come here for lunch! You can't pass up this experience especially at the price.\n\nDATE TIP: You can be a baller on a budget here, fo sho. You'll certainly impress your date! Only thing is the price is displayed very clearly at the top of the menu, so hopefully they're impressed by your deal-finding skills. Otherwise you should kick them to the curb anyway!"

Although it is easy to get sucked in by paying a little extra for drinks or some of the more expensive add-ons.  But trust me ... the normal entrees are still great.  You don't leave feeling completely stuffed, but it's a perfectly filling meal.\n\nAs of 2014, you pay 22.14 for a three course meal (it used to be 20.13 in keeping with the year ... guess they had to bump the price).  One starter, one entree, and a light dessert (fruit or greek yogurt martini).\n\nDon't miss it.  Everything is really fresh and tastes great.  It's one of our go-to places when we visit."

First of all make sure you go for lunch they have a prix fixe menu where each person gets an entr\u00e9e appetizer and dessert for around $25. \n\nThe waiter said the octopus on the appetizer menu is normally $40 for dinner. It was absolutely incredible!! Bite for bite it can go toe to toe with the best steak I've ever had. It is flown in fresh from the Mediterranean every day and it was absolutely out of this world.  Wife ordered the lobster pasta which was an up charge on the menu but came with a full pound of lobster in a pretty decent sauce.  But I can probably say for the first time in the history of the world that the chicken was better than the lobster. I ordered the chicken skewer it was huge chunks of juicy chicken with a pita and a tzatziki sauce which will leave me looking down at every other Greek restaurant for the rest of my life.  \n\nDon't think twice about it just go it was totally worth it the only downside was that the patio was closed while we were there and it looked really nice. Mike was our waiter he was awesome and led us through everything on the menu.  Cant wait to go back."

It was dry, not very flavorful at all, the source was nonexistent to cover up the lackluster quality of fish, and they want to charge $48/lb for THAT?!  You can serve a GOOD fish with minimal flavoring/source, but for THAT kind of fish, they would need a lot of help to cover up what's lacking, but it wasn't there.  \n\nAgain, for those who are not familiar with fresh fish or seafood in general, you maybe fooled into thinking that it's good because of the high price tag, but it's not some  place I would go back on my own dime, no, not even for half that price.  Trust your palate.  \n\nBad fish happens.  But if it's bad, you don't serve it.  You don't charge an arm and a leg for it.  I won't go back."

Of course, the caveat is that many of the choices require an additional charge on top of the prix fix. And the dessert is a choice between Greek yogurt or fruit salad.\n\nFor starters, my friend got the grilled octopus ($10 extra) which was delicious, but i stuck w/ one of the standard choices. I got the mezze platter that came w/ pita and tzatiziki, cod roe and roasted red pepper spreads. The tomato salad, which is a regular choice was also delicious comprised entirely of large chunks of plump to tomatoes.\n\nFor the main, most of us got grilled bass. It's a grilled whole fish topped with some olive tapenade. I strongly recommend it, not fishy at all. They also offer lamb chops and a lobster pasta that looked good, but again, costs extra.\n\nDefinitely try this place out for a very reasonably priced lunch in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas!"

We had the grilled octopus salad, which is honestly the best octopus I've ever had in my life (trumping the one I ate in Italy!).  The octopus was obviously fresh and so creamy.  It cut like butter and was just overall amazing.  Our entrees were the Lavraki and the lobster pasta, both very excellent.  Although, we had just had some -amazing- trout at db Brasserie the night before so, even though the Lavraki was amazing in its own right, it paled a bit against that. \n\nThe pasta was everything I looked for in a lobster dish though, with large chunks of lobster and a sauce that complimented everything perfectly.\n\nI was a bit disappointed in the dessert options at first (really, no chocolate??), but upon tasting the greek yogurt, I was blown away.  I'd come back just for that alone!  Super rich with just enough tartness for the raspberry puree to really shine. Even with all the restaurants left in Vegas to try, we will definitely be hitting up this place for lunch again!"

The Greek salad was delicious , but The grilled octopus was amazing! So chewy and and tender , I would recommend the octopus over the salad. For the main entree, the sea bream was so fantastic, and was very filling as well. Again, very tender and well grilled. Lastly for dessert, the fresh Greek yogurt was thick and rich, but not too sweet. The karidopita was a kind of sweet cake with a very distinct-flavored ice cream on top.  I think both are worth trying, but the yogurt is more preferred for me. \n\nIf you are in the mood to drink, the wine pairing is great as well! $16 for 2 glasses of wine that the waiter or a sommelier will pair with your appetizer and entree. It's a great time to try some Greek wine if you haven't before! The ones I got were Very light and crisp, pairing well with the salad and fish. Yummy! \n\nPresentation, service, ambiance, all were spectacular ! I loved it! Would definitely return !"

Fish is flown in fresh, daily from around the world.  The chefs skills are truly shown w/ pure, un-adultered dishes, mainly seasoned with salt and pepper, sometimes olive oil, and at most w/ a reduced balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nNOTE: Both times, the chef customized our menu and we didn't have to choose items from the main menu.\n\nSetting: Dinner with a friend, Monday 08/22/2011.  We were lucky they had a 2-top available, as it was MAGIC week.\n\nThumbs Up: You can't go wrong by leaving it up to the chef (omakase in Japanese restaurants).  But if not, must gets are: the octopus (so tender, crisp, and yummy); Milos special (eggplant and cucumber chips w/ tzatziki sauce [make sure to mix it up and dig out the tzatziki as it cuts through the saltiness]); cooked whole fish (we had red snapper, and was very fresh and delicious); service staff if very helpful - don't be shy to ask any questions, and even take a tour of the fish being displayed.  Their service staff had good recommendations on wine pairings w/ the different seafood dishes.\n\nThumbs Down:  Nothing.\n\nTip: Most of the bad reviews are a result of not being seated for a 2-top.

Went for the $20.11 lunch on a Friday which is definitely one of the best values on the Strip for a high-end meal.  \n2. First* waitress gave detailed explanation of top dishes and seemed credible (advised that the salmon was nothing special and to get something else)\n3. Good food and surprisingly large portions.  \n-- Citrus/mint scallop appetizer was amazing but incredibly small (2 TINY scallops).\n-- Lavraki (Mediterranean sea bass) was good.\n-- Karidopita for dessert was very rich, but very good.  (Crushed walnuts and honey topped with ice cream)\n\nThe bad/odd:\n1. *Every point of contact was from someone else.  Our first waitress was great and helpful with recommendations, but then we never saw her again...  Someone else came to take our orders, another person for drinks, another to deliver food, another to check in on it, ... No one was bad, but the lack of continuity detracted from the quality of the service.\n2. My co-workers' lobster was severely undercooked in places.\n3. While ordering, one of the staff recommended a \"can't miss\" appetizer of fried eggplant and zucchini with tzatziki from off-the-menu.  We got it and it was okay, but then it ended up costing $30 (in line with the regular priced items, but 150% of the entire 3-course lunch!).  Felt kind of shady to push this so hard and have it end up being so expensive.\n4. Also got kind of an annoying vibe from the reservations call.  We called midweek to get a table at 12 on Friday.  We were told after being put on hold and getting transferred that we could \"get squeezed in\".  When we arrived we were the 2nd or 3rd table in the whole restaurant.  Although it filled up by the time we left after 1:30, still seemed like a bit of false press.  Adding to that, one of our 12 servers bragged that Milos was \"the talk of the town\" and he was stunned we had never been there... probably a bit of a hyperbole given that they are selling a $20 3-course lunch..."

It's hard to complain about a nice meal at these prices, but before I thought it was a steal, whereas now I feel it's more of a standard lunch deal.

Small selection of half bottles (3) I saw. \n\nCon: No corkage fee, don't allow wine from outside in. ( I can under stand)\n\ntotal: $84 + tips = $104"

The taramasalata on the maze plate is particularly good.\n\nThe shrimp main we had was delicious, fish with capers just OK. The Greek yogurt dessert was delicious -- thick, creamy, great berries.

I started off with the tomato and feta salad, which was light and fresh! Then I chose the sea bass which was to die for!!! One of the most tender and simple prepared fresh fish I have ever eaten. \n\nThey catch their fish in the Mediterranean and fly it in next day! Can't get much fresher than this unless we are in Greece!\n\nFor dessert, I had the Greek yogurt. Light fresh and great ending to a perfect lunch.\n\nMy BF had the grilled octopus to start ($10extra). It was good but I enjoyed my tomato salad better.\n\nHe ordered the grilled chicken and I found it to be dry.

            "review": "3.5 stars\n\nI hadn't read a lot of reviews before dining at Milos, but what I did know is that it's expensive. As expensive as dinner can be, Estiatorio Milos offers what I think is one of the best lunch deals on the Strip - a 3-course, $22.13 menu. Six appetizers are available to choose from (two with supplemental pricing), six entrees (two with supplemental pricing), and three dessert options. The tempting pricing supplements, which range from $10-15 extra, can quickly drive the prix-fixe up, but there are attractive options when sticking to the $22 menu as well.\n\nBread is served warm, crusty on the outside and very soft on the inside. Fruity olive oil is served instead of butter, something I actually prefer almost every time.\n\nFried Calamari fresh calamari, lightly fried with lemon - This starter isn't part of the fixed menus, but was one of the house specialties so we gave it a try. The batter was light and crispy, delicate with tender squid. With a light squeeze of lemon, these were simple but delicious bites. However at $24 a plate, there isn't a ton of value here since you could get another 3-course for less.\n\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous - My mother had these skewered scallops; cooked well, these were tender and moist. Some sweetness from bell peppers and onion were a welcome accompaniment.\n\nGrilled Octopus sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled - A $10 supplement, this was one of the better dishes of the lunch. Extremely tender, the octopus was contrasted with a bright onion flavor and fresh parsley. Loved the texture.\n\nFresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake with marinated gigantes beans & mustard emulsion - Another $10 supplement from the appetizer options, I liked the delicate crust of the crab cake but overall flavors were fairly muted. Not bad, but not the most interesting.\n\nWe tried four of the entree options.\n\nLavraki grilled Mediterranean bass - This was a hit; the dense flesh of the bass was very moist and the skin was oh-so-crispy. A touch of fruity olive oil and salty capers were a nice addition to the fish, which didn't need much more.\n\nOrganic Chicken Breast Skewer grilled mushrooms & onions, served over pita - My cousin got this dish; the lone piece of chicken that I tried was pretty dry.\n\nColorado USDA Prime Lamb Chops french fries & broccoli - My grandmother opted for the lamb chops ($10 supplement), cooked a nice medium rare. Tender and juicy, this was a good option for someone wanting to avoid the seafood route.\n\nNova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta light tomato sauce - I went for this dish. Although the $15 pricing supplement was relatively steep, there seemed to be a lot of value in this dish. A whole small lobster was carefully broken apart, leaving the meat bathed within linguini and a light tomato cream sauce. The lobster was just a touch more cooked than what I would've liked, but was sweet and tasty nonetheless. The pasta had a nice richness without being too heavy.\n\nFor dessert, we tried two of the three options.\n\nFresh Fruits of the Season - Pretty much as advertised.\n\nWalnut Cake with Kaimaki ice cream - The cake was sweet, slightly earthy, and pretty moist. The ice cream was refreshing; interestingly, it's made from the resin of mastic trees, native to Greece.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal here and I wouldn't mind returning for lunch. I wouldn't say it was good enough to inspire a visit for a $100+ dinner, though. The scallops and Lavraki fish would make an excellent $22 lunch meal; in terms of the supplements, I'd splurge on the octopus and lobster pasta again. Heck, many Vegas buffets are more than $22 for lunch; you don't get the same variety but the quality at Milos is clearly several notches above. Definitely recommended for a lunch visit, but I'll have to read more positive reviews to visit for dinner."

I had never been here before, but have only herd good things. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we were rudely greeted by the one out of two hostesses that were at the host stand. No smile, no energy, no welcoming \"Thanks for joining us at our restaurant by spending your hard earned money and keeping me in the job\" vibe, NOTHING. Crazy, in my opinion, we should have left, but didn't because the plans to eat here were already in affect. \n\nWe were seated promptly, and had a nice view of their wine room that is encased in glass. Pretty cool. Our server was very friendly, and had just started there a few months prior. She gave us some recommendations, and we followed through with them. \n\nFor my appetizer I ordered the \"Grilled Octopus\"(refer to pic)($10 additional fee). The octopus was charcoal-broiled perfectly, and was good. Maybe I like more \"Eclectic\" food, but this was just so simple. The octopus was accompanied by red onions and capers with the plate being drizzled with oil. Nothing amazing, just good. We Also ordered the \"Milos Special\", which was lightly fried zucchini and eggplant w/ tzatziki & kefalograviers cheese. This, center shared appetizer, was delicious! The zucchini and eggplant were fried PERFECTLY. The yogurt sauce, that was inside the stack of fried veggies, added such a nice tang, that really balanced all of flavors flawlessly and made all of us go back for more. \n\nThe birthday boy ordered the \"Crab Cake\"(refer to pic)($10 additional fee) appetizer. From what I tried, the cake was okay... just very simple, small, and had nothing special going on. The b-day boy regretted ordering it.\n\nFor my lunch entree I ordered the servers recommendation, the \"Lavraki\"(refer to pic). This Mediterranean bass is a \"specialty at Milos\". After finding three(3) pin bones in my fish, I figured it wasn't as \"SPECIAL\" as the server mentioned. The fish was cooked well, but once again... nothing special. When you are eating at such an upscale restaurant, you expect amazing flavors, quality, service, and atmosphere. It was blowing my mind that there was such a simplistic approach with no added spark, and still errors and missteps. \n\nMy friend ordered the \"Nova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta\"(refer to pic)($15 additional fee), which he thought was an absolute, complete joke. The pasta was tossed in a red, tomato sauce and was accompanied by the top and bottom half of the lobster, while the middle of the lobster was the pasta. It was absurd. The pasta came out lukewarm, and he didn't want to inconvenience anyone, so he didn't want to complain. I thought the pasta had some good flavors, but the presentation was... just a hot mess. \n\nFor dessert I had the server order for me. She brought out a \"Yogurt Martini\"(refer to pic) which was tangy, tart, and good for what it was.. Greek yogurt inside of a martini glass. The b-day boy ordered the \"Walnut Cake w/ Kaimaki Ice Cream\"(refer to pic) which we thought was moist, and delicious. I was envious of his dessert. No candle was given, or even a \"happy birthday\" but that's understandable. All the other standards of food quality, service standards, etc.. were disappointing.\n\nOverall, the meal was a bust. We left not satisfied and extremely underwhelmed for my friends birthday. We will not return."

The quality and freshness of the food is incomparable.  \n\nWe had a server who was so attentive, I wouldn't have thought that he was serving anyone else but us.  The experience is something of it's own.  They have a display where you can actually walk up to it, learn about the fish on the menu, and then hand pick the fish you will be eating that night.  \n\nWe had an appetizer, an entree and dessert between two people.  This place is not cheap...but man, you get what you pay for!  For our appetizer we had the charred octopus.  ORDER THIS!  You'll think that it was caught right out of the ocean, just for you and your dinner that night!  I'm from Hawaii and it was like the fresh tako that I am used to back home, but much fancier and much tastier.  This was followed by our order of a 1.8lb fish that was some sort of mediterranean bass.  This thing was grilled to perfection and served with fresh lemon, herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil.  Alongside this dish, we ordered a platter of grilled vegetables that came with peppers, asparagus, some sort of greek cheese, and zucchini.  EVERYTHING TASTED SO FRESH and was perfectly seasoned.  The food was so good that my friend and I stopped talking for a few minutes just so we could enjoy the flavors in our mouths!  It was so good that I'm writing this review over a month later and I still remember every part of that meal.\n\nWe topped it off with the baklavah.  This was good baklahvah.  My boyfriend is turkish, I've been to greece, and my very good friend is from lebanon.  I've had my share of this dessert.  I wouldn't say it was the best bakalvah, but it definitely was good!  Not overly sweet and it comes with ice cream to accent it. \n\nGO HERE!  ...and prepare to be amazed"

The minute our butts hit the table the sommelier was over with a wine list and asking our water preference. He then gave us a quick history and overview of the restaurant before leaving us for the time being. \n\nHe returned a few minutes later and We were undecided on what wine to get by the glass so he narrowed it dow to two choices and brought us samples. Yay for awesome service!\n\nI told the wifey that we had to order the Milos special which was a stack of thinly sliced and fried zucchini and eggplant with a few cheese cubes. \n\nOur waitress came over, asked if we had any questions and asked if we wanted to go fishing. Milos has the catches of the day on ice on display and the servers take you to the display and explain each fish and what to expect when ordering/eating them. Our server Toni walked us around and explained everything. She was very knowledgeable- akin to being at the SF fisherman's wharf without the throwing or yelling. So in essence nothing like being at the wharf. :)  \n\nSo we ended up ordering the Milos special, the small raw fish plate,  \nthe St. Pierre (Jon Dory) and the wife had the Mediterranean spiny lobster. \n\nSpecial: \n\n30 bucks and effing amazing. If your expecting the zucchini sticks you get at Red Robin, you should grab your Bud Light and leave:) \n\nOur sashimi plate was pretty good as well. I suppose it will draw comparisons to sushi places. Tuna, scallops and few others I cannot remember. The tuna had a bit of dill on it which is a greek thing but then again dill is not in my spice cabinet. \n\nDinner:\nJon Dory: 2lbs @ $46 each\nThis by far was the best piece of fish I have ever had. It was the whole fish, cut in half, cooked and seasoned to perfection. It was tender, moist  and most of all packed with flavor. It was AMAZING. \n\nSpiny lobster (Langouste)- 2.05lbs @90something a pound\n\nThe whole lobster arrives cut in half with the tail drenched in butter. My wife thought it was a bit under cooked but I actually think it was cooked perfectly. Considering the fella was alive 20 minutes ago it didn't need to be cooked to the normal level of steakhouse lobster tail.  I think it was perfect. She really enjoyed it except for some of the bits that were to her a touch under. So I got to eat them. YAY ME:) \n\nThe meat was sweet and tender. The presentation was great and my wife was doing the biology lesson on the fella. Kinda cool to see. \n\nOur wait staff, Toni and Hilary was amazing and if you get the chance to dine with them be sure to ask for them. \n\nSo our bill with tip for the 2 of us was just over 560 dollars. I told my wife that I could have flown her to SF, had the Chef's Plank at Lafitte and flown back for that kinda money. \n\nHer counter was two pairs of really hot shoes. :)\n\nEver again? Probably not.  (Maybe the 20.11 lunch special)\nGlad I did? Certainly. Perfect meal for the perfect night."

Second best thing is that I would have paid for it even if I didn't have the hotel credit because it was only $20.12 a person for a three course lunch! \n\nAppetizer:\nSashimi grade Octopus was amazing... it costs an extra $10 to choose that as your appetizer but it was so worth the $10 (that was also covered by the hotel credit). It was just chewy enough with a crisp bite, and it was just lightly flavored with some lemon, capers, and other stuff. The scallop skewer was also amazing. Cooked to perfection... it literally just melted in my mouth!\n\nMain Course:\nLavraki - grilled bass was impossibly good.  It was prepared and served whole, and mostly de-boned.  The flavoring was just on the dot, but most importantly the fish was extremely fresh.  I wonder how a restaurant in the middle of a desert can get such fresh fish but they're doing an amazing job conjuring fresh seafood from nowhere. :)\n\nDessert:\nWalnut Cake was great.  It had a very unique spice to it but I can't pinpoint what it was.  It was served with a dollop of amazing ice cream :). Wonderful sweet endings to a perfect meal :). \n\nService: Very friendly, and they take reservations.  I recommend putting in reservations because they can get busy (not surprised because of the decent pricing for very good food!)"

In my opinion, well worth it.\nFirst you can start at the fresh fish stand to choose your particular fish, if you so choose.  The specimens my husband and I have seen over the course of about ten visits (between lunch and dinner) have always had clear eyes and a clean smell (not like old stagnant fish).  Coming from the landlocked Midwest, we appreciate the ability to have fresh options that are flown in from distant places and served as fresh as possible.  \nThe Three Course Lunch Pre Fixe is a favorite of ours.  The price is reasonable for what is offered.  The menu does not change that dramatically for this part, so we have tried most of the dishes.  Portions are not huge for lunch, but we have never left unsatiated after having three courses with bread to start.\nService has been excellent each time we have visited, well-choreographed, and we were never left wanting.  My husband and I brought another couple for dinner last week and had yet another wonderful experience.  We shared the salt encrusted fish which was way too much food for four people, as we chose a fish that was about 5 pounds.  \nThe decor is comfortable yet elegant and there is plenty of space between parties, which is important to me as I don't like feeling crowded.\nThis is a place I would recommend for special occasion dinner, lunch pre fixe, or any time you'd like to have some fantastic Mediterranean food in Las Vegas."

Milos delivered the worst service my wife and I have experienced a restaurant at this price point.\n\nNot seeing your server for 15 minutes after getting seating was our first clue.  To her credit, my wife suggested that we leave, but I foolishly wanted to stick it out.  Eventually our server arrived, visibly frazzled and edgy.  He blew through the menu and specials like he was being timed in a race.  We never received bread, though I felt we hit the lottery when the assistant sommelier took care of pouring our wine, because we knew our server would not.\n\nTo our left, the gentleman had to send back his undercooked steak, and then had to flag down his server for the check.  To our right, the woman demanded a new server and asked for the manager.  Salt in the wound...  for some reason they didn't replace the server.\n\nTo show that Milos discriminates against no one, our server was also serving the Cosmo CEO and his guest.  From what I could tell, he was on the receiving end of the same treatment.\n\nAnd the perfect cherry for this Greek sundae of awfulness...  on our way out my wife met two women in the restroom who were also complaining that the service was the \"worst they've experienced.\"\n\nOh, I guess I should say something about the food.  Terribly overpriced stone crab claws w/ bland sauce (though quite fresh).  My wife's oysters were superb, and the Milos special was tasty.  We had the same fish for our main course.  I found it decent but hardly worth the price, with an overly salty sauce.  And both fish were full of bones, though they're supposed to be de-boned.  We didn't stick around for dessert because we had already been there for over two hours.\n\nThe atmosphere was disappointing as well.  Incredibly loud and bright inside - absolutely not a romantic environment if that's what you're thinking/seeking.  \n\nMilos - get your act together, and do it quickly.  Not that I'll ever know, because I'll never return."

You won't get a 3 course lunch that is THIS good for $20.   The space is beautiful, the bread is heavenly, and the food was nothing short of fabulous.  I had the appetizer sampler, which showcased their pita bread with a few different dips [hummus, cheese, etc.], their seared SEA BASS, and walnut cake for dessert.  \n\nThey are known for their seafood here at the restaurant, so if you get a chance, don't skip out on their catches.  The sea bass that I had was prepared simply- but it was super awesome because it didn't take anything away from the delicate flavor of the fish.  If i had to be completely honest, dessert was kind of a throwaway since they ran out of a lot of the other stuff, so I was kind of cornered into getting the walnut cake.  It was moist and reminded me of carrot cake... but I wasn't a big fan.\n\nService was impeccable, and I'm almost kicking myself for even writing a review because I don't want people to know about this place... but it's so amazing you HAVE to go."

They served it with purposely burnt bread which wasn't very tasty. Next up was octopus with peppers and mushrooms. For the main course I chose the sea bass which came with spinach type like greens. From the way it was cooked, it kind of dried out. The waiter warned as it was served, that there were bones. So i had to remove the bones from my mouth as I ate the fish. Others ordered the lamb which was a very small portion served chop style. Their dish came with french fries. The lamb was on the dry side for my fellow diners. Last came some kind of coffee cake like dessert, which none of us at the table really partook of. Very nice restaurant ambiance overlooking the strip. You can walk by and there is a market like set up of the raw ingredients and fish and other seafood displayed on ice with the price per pound. It all looked very fresh and appetizing. All of that earned them an extra star. Otherwise it's a 1 for the food."

Excellent venue for a family dinner but if you go during lunch for the prixe fixe menu, you will save ALOT of money and experience the exact same food....albeit smaller portions.  \n\nI think the decor and ambience is very uplifting and clean.  There is an outdoor patio section as well.\n\nI absolutely LOVE the food here and the service is impeccable every time I go.  \n\nGrilled octopus is perfectly done and served with sliced onions.  They do a fantastic job at tenderizing the meat and cooking it just perfectly so that it is soft and not rubbery.  I highly recommend this appetizer.\n\nTomato salad with aged feta cheese is simple and fresh, with nice light flavors.  It is a great compliment to the meal (it goes great with the octopus as well). \n\nGrilled mushrooms are an assortment of different types and we really enjoyed them..\n\nThe main dish was the lavraki (aka branzino or mediterranean sea bass) - absolutely delicious and unforgettable!  My personal all time favorite fish dish.  Let me qualify that statement by explaining that I am an avid fisherman and a fish eating fanatic (I enjoy eating fish at least 3-4 times per week).  The waitress told me that the fish is flown in fresh from Greece.  At dinner time, I have paid $60 per pound for this fish to serve our group (usually takes a 4-5 lb fish), but the lunch size version is a smaller individual sized specimen, and just as delicious (and way cheaper).  The branzino is grilled perfectly and served deboned by the waiter.  The flesh is buttery in texture and seasoned with olive oil, parsley, lemon juice, and capers....so simple, yet so perfectly balanced.  The charred skin is crispy and bursting with flavor.....super tasty!  I actually considered ordering a second fish just for myself.\n\nWe also had a sliced ribeye with asparagus for those in our group who don't love fish as much as others.  It was very solid but not their specialty.\n\nDessert at lunch time was a fresh fruit dish which was nice and refreshing.  At dinner, we chose the option of a flourless chocolate cake that I will have to admit was the best one I have ever tried anywhere.  However, I was told that the dessert options change regularly so it might not always be available.  \n\nThis is an exceptional dining experience that I try not to miss whenever I have a chance to go to Vegas.  I certainly understand that it might not be for everyone\nand it is not the cheapest option around, but if you're in Vegas.....live a little and go ahead and splurge.....it might become one of your favorites too."

The hostess tells us to go stand by the table that we will be seated at so that the staff will know to clear and then set the service for us. We should have left right then.  Instead we stand awkwardly then sit down. Then nothing... Finally after 10 minutes a woman comes over and asks us if we are going to want anything.  Yes please, maybe some water, menus, plates, etc??? What is it that she thinks we are here for???\n\nWe get bread and water and menus. Now a new guy comes over. The menu is confusing if you have never dined here before. I asked for an explanation about how to order, how do we know what the specials are. What kind of a response did I get, he basically mumbled and walked away.\n\nThis sort of cat and mouse game went on with numerous service issues. To get to the point, we finally got food, but clearly could have used the advice that we asked for as we ordered far too much for two people. \n\nTomato salad $26.00- Hot house tomatoes, green bell peppers, feta and olives. This was about the same quality that I have at the buffet earlier that day. It was well seasoned, not very fresh, certainly not high quality tomato, very good feta.\n\nMediterranean spread- This was one of the best things that we had, definitely enough food for 4.\n\nSteamed potatoes- $18 COLD. As in, these are served chilled. Not good. Not just because they are served chilled, they are simply just not good. There is absolutely nothing about these potatoes that is at all memorable. We did not even attempt to make a dent in them. \n\nThe fish was excellent. it was also $81/pound for Snapper PLUS a cooking charge. however when they brought the fish that they serve table side, they had not bused any appetizer plates, and I was left holding the dirty plates on my lap until they sent a waiter over to clear space for another plate. This is actually funny how horrible it was. I nearly laughed or cried or something, WTF.\n\n\nI am actually offended at the service I received here. Truly outrageous for 100 and up per plate."

Of course we ordered octopus and crab cakes, which each had supplements (and then wine/drink, coffee, so you can get far beyond that $20.12 per person).  The food was great.  The drinks were delicious.  My friend and I had the Mediterranean sea bass as well and, while I'm not a fan of bony fish, I just loved its flavor.  So good.  For dessert my friend had fruit and I had the yogurt martini, which was refreshing and a nice conclusion to lunch.\n\nBut, the topper was dining on the indoor-outdoor terrace.

Our server was very good, overall service from wait staff was great. As a starter you receive a char grilled crusty bread and extra virgin olive oil to dip. It was decent but I felt the charred parts of the bread overwhelmed the fruity flavor of the EVOO. Toasted crusty bread with EVOO tho, very good.\nOur appetizers were the calamari, meze plate, tomato salad & grilled octopus. The tomato salad was mine, it had a good flavor. Chunks of tomato, a kalamata olive, capers, cucumber & red onions slices tossed in a vinagrette with a triangle of feta cheese on the side to crumble into the salad. I had a piece of calamari, it was nice, crisp and not overly chewy.\nFor the entree I had the lavraki(mediterranean sea bass). It looks like it was cooked with lemon & capers. It was tender, flaky and had a very mild and light flavor, very nice. The broccoli it came with however was fairly soft and mushy, too overdone. I had a piece of my sister's honjake salmon. It was cooked perfectly, slightly crisp on the outside, very tender and juicy on the inside.\nDessert was the walnut pie with kaimaki ice cream. The pie's square shape and texture appearance resembles that of a piece of cornbread with a quenelle of ice cream on top of it. If you turned baklava into a cake, it would be this walnut pie. The ice cream had a hint of slightly bitter, earthy herbiness I couldn't describe. I had to ask our server and she said the flavor is due to it being made with pine resin. By itself the herbiness is a tad strong but with the walnut pie it compliments the sweetness. Not that I wouldn't mind sweet on sweet either but it was decent.\nThis definitely isn't a cheap place ordering ala carte. But you do get a great value for the tasting menu, even if you do get some extras.\nI was in between giving it 3 or 4 stars, no half star options here but the good service we received will get it a solid 4 stars."

Red onions gave the dish heat and the capers gave it brininess. The chefs finished the dish with olive oil which gave the dish umami. Umami is the fifth taste, which resembles earthiness. Some foods that have umami are mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, soy sauce, and olive oil.\n     The meze platter was satisfactory. All the components were delicious separately but it did not marry together. All of the components in one bite resulted in an overly salty and overly umami taste that stuck on your tongue. I could have made a better platter at home. \n     The crab cakes were made with whole chunks of blue crab which made them taste extremely fresh. On the side were a bean salad (beans, peppers, olive oil, fresh herbs, etc.) and a Dijon mustard emulsion served on a wedge of red cabbage. Overall, the crab cakes were my favorite appetizer because they were fresh and light.\n     Now to entr\u00e9es! My Nova Scotia lobster pasta was the best lobster dish I have ever had. The pasta was perfectly cooked to my liking (al dente) and tossed with a fresh herbaceous tomato sauce and fresh lobster claw and tail meat. Don't be afraid to ask the waiter to put lobster tamale on your pasta! The green substance gives the dish richness that butter or Parmesan cheese would have. \n     The restaurant attempted to cook a whole bass. The fish was very flavorful; you could taste tangy lemon juice, fresh herbs, and saltwater that the fish was once breathing. However, the fish was slightly over cooked. Bass is supposed to be flaky and the bass here was too flaky that the meat almost disintegrated on my fork, which is a sign of overcooked fish.\n     The lamb chops had the perfect amount of marbled fat that kept it juicy and tender. However, the potatoes that they were served with were bathing in olive oil.\n     You must try this place if you are near Vegas!"

The Bass was very good but it was very disappointing how they prided themselves on deboning and there were zillions of bones.  When I mentioned the number of bones of the fish to the waiter he changed his tune about how perfect the deboning was and said what do you expect from a small fish they just have lots of bones in them. For dessert they only had a choice of yogurt or fresh fruit.  I ordered the fresh fruit and it was okay but a little bit on the boring side for a fancy restaurant. The waiter surprised us with a complimentary extra dessert of baklava this is probably the worst baklava I've ever had in my entire life. The entire center was dried out and was like concrete.  There's was hardly anything soaking in honey."

Alas, we got back was nothing beyond standard, doused in lemon butter with capers, like you'd get most anywhere.  The fish itself (a red snapper) did not offend but was wholly unremarkable.  I've had better elsewhere for a fraction of the price.  The menu is a la carte, so don't expect any sides with that either.  We got some fried potatoes to that end, which turned out of be a small amount of thick-cut fries, for $12.  Even though I expected a pretty big bill, I didn't expect such mediocre food and small portions.  The ambiance was a melange of upscale and trendy.  No doubt, many patrons were trying to impress one another, which is inconsequential to me, except as entertainment (perhaps, for this, I give a star?).  (Collagen to the left of them, silicon to the right of them!  Volley and thunder!)  The service was brusque, and often inattentive.  The guy who refilled the water and the bread was far better than our actual waiters (yes, there were two).\n\nIn summary, even though I expected a rather big bill, I couldn't help leave feeling I'd been suckered, not to mention a bit hungry, at paying more than top dollar for average, insufficient food. I don't mind paying good money for an awesome experience, but this was not it, and I couldn't help but compare to much better meals I've had, with better service, for less.  Do not go here unless you have the appetite of a model and the, uh, patron to pay for you."

But after the $10 supplement for the octopus appetizer and some wine, the bill ended up at $120 for two after tax and tip. \n\nI was a trifle disappointed in the octopus, which seemed just a touch on the oily side to me. I did really like the shrimp saganaki as my main course. It was wonderfully flavorful. And the greek yogurt with honey and nuts was a nice dessert. (The menu said it was with strawberries and also has a no substitutions message, but when I told them I was allergic to strawberries, they graciously offered the honey and nuts option.) We had a couple of glasses of (very expensive) Greek wines which were OK. Greek wine is not my favorite, but these were better than most I've had although still not great. The service was a little tentative and felt slightly undertrained and lacking in confidence. Maybe they have the newbies working the Tuesday lunch shift. \n\nThe decor is nice, clean and white and it feels Mediterranean without being cliche about it. The dining space is HUGE, with tons of tables inside as well as a fairly large patio. For lunch in July, the patio was a little uncomfortably warm and the fans and tiny misters didn't do enough to mitigate it. In retrospect, we should have chosen to eat inside. I would say that I would probably go back and give some other appetizers a try at the bar in the future, but probably not a full meal."

We made reservations to go after our Michael Jackson show at 9PM. \n\nFrom the minute we showed up and were seated at a circular table towards the center of the dining area we were immediately disappointed.  It took our waiter at least 5 minutes before they even acknowledged us.  My mom had time to go to the bathroom and come back and still we waited.  When our waiter finally came my dad was very irritated- we were all ravenous and grumpy.  When the waiter read off the specials he did so with an aire of complete elitism and arrogance. It put our whole table off and we immediately commented on his attitude of complete boredom with us.  He read off the specials quickly slurring his words and not making eye contact.  From there the whole tone of the dinner was set.  Briefly our order:\nBottle of Wine- all are insanely overpriced\nGrilled Octopus- amazing, bet thing we ordered, very small potion- they say its family style sizes.. they are small sizes\nDozen Oysters- half kumamoto half kushi- I love oysters and these were extremely disappointing. Each one was full of grit and shell. we were all spitting pieces out after every bite. The mignonet and raspberry sauces they serve alongside were far too similar.\nMilos Special- the biggest rip off of all. $30 dollars for basically fried zucchini? SO OVERPRICED and not very special. \nDessert: Svigous- basically fried donuts with bitter honey and walnut on top- nobody ate it...\nUltimately my whole family letft the restaurant at each others throats.

For example, one tomato salad includes at least 3 big chopped up tomatoes in one bowl with a big chunk of feta cheese and a whole fish with jumbo broccoli. If this is a European style restaurant it should go along with European acceptable portions. Anyhow, recently we have been told by our server that we are not allowed to share anymore, each gets a meal. We call over a manager just to verify. Manager man didn't introduce himself, had a weak charisma presence and attitude. For his answer he simply disagreed with us saying that the portions were not too big, reminded us of the lunch policy, shook his shoulders and walked away. I give Milos 2 stars because the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. I will not be returning. At the end of our experience I came to a conclusion that the Cosmopolitan casino in general is going through business related issues, and the restaurants are trying their best to make it through the slow season ahead."

We had every intention of not spending much, but after ordering oysters and wine pairings with our lunch our $40 steal became $140. But, that's our fault for enjoying this place so much.\n\nThe meze plate app and the scallop skewer app were both simple and fabulous. Pita this good (on the meze dish) is hard to come by. As good as the tamara, tzatziki, and htipiti were, I was left craving more of the pita's pillowy goodness.\n\nEntrees were amazing. The chicken breast skewer was delicious and the lavraki was as good a piece of fish as I've had in town. \n\nFor desserts, we got the fresh fruit plate and the walnut cake. The cake shouldn't be missed -- so moist and full of flavors you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThe kumamoto oysters were great, but they're also the priciest we've encountered.\n\nThe only negative was the fruit flies buzzing around. No matter, I'd still come back in a heart beat, but I'll come prepared to drop some serious coin for the experience because it will be worth it.\n\n4.5 Stars"

We were originally disappointed because they were not offering the prix fixe we had seen online, and which we had called specifically to inquire and were told would be available. However, they were offering another prix fixe for restaurant week and although it was not what we were originally expecting we decided to go for it. The food was EXCELLENT. The standouts were the tomato salad which was incredibly fresh and delicious, the carpaccio (I loved it and I am NOT normally a fan of anything raw) and of course the fish which was cooked and prepared to perfection. The emphasis here is on fresh simple flavors done right. I would reccomend the prix fixe; the whole fish idea seems fun but definitely gets pricey. \n\nOnly negative- the service. Our waitress (not sure what her name was but she was a tall blond) was not knowledgeable about the menu and seemed to be mocking us the whole time. That being said, the gentleman who served our fish (tableside) was extremely nice and helpful and so we just started asking him for things. Julius was incredibly helpful (and cute!) He got us anything and everything we needed and took the time to explain all of the food to us. He exemplified what fine-dining service should be. His service and the excellent food provided for a wonderful evening. \n\nIf you like seafood go to Milos. You will not regret it!"

As she is Greek and she hadn't visited the Cosmopolitan yet, she thought it was a sure bet to eat at Estiatorio Milos for dinner. \n\nNot so much.\n\nWe didn't get seated until almost an hour after our reservation (with the restaurant continually telling us that our table was being set up). If the hostess had just said \"hey, we are running behind. Why don't you get a drink at the bar?\" we would have been more than happy to do so. Instead, when we were seated we were all starving and not all all tipsy. A glass of wine would have been a good relaxant to prepare for what was coming next. \n\nThe restaurant brought bread, but no water. As the whole table was starving, we were trying to eat the dry bread with no water, choking. No menus. No silverware. Getting a glass of wine took 40 minutes, every time. After countless service frustrations, a member of our party asked to speak to a manager. She then repeated that request several more times throughout the meal to our server. The manager did not ever present himself during our meal. At the end, we tracked him down and recounted our service ordeal (he was the guy I had complained to earlier who told me he was a sommelier). He never did apologize, in the end trying to explain our issues to him was a waste of breath. We weren't looking for a reduction in the bill. We just wanted a \"I'm sorry. That is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe only saving grace for this restaurant is the food. It was divine. We ordered 2 roasted fish(es?), a bunch of sides, salads and appetizers. The octopus, snapper, and beets with goat cheese really stood out. I also enjoyed the tomato salad - simple and delicious. Some people at the table ordered seared tuna, which was apparently not as impressive as the whole roasted fish. There were 11 of us at dinner, we did not order bottles of wine (but did have a few glasses), and our bill was $1400. Ouch. \n\nThe space is beautiful, as is the Cosmopolitan. The service is so horrible it will ruin your evening. No matter how good the food is, I will never return to this restaurant. I cannot reward such bad behavior with a return trip. When people are paying more than $100 per person for dinner, they expect to be treated with at least a little bit of respect."

I asked the obvious question and was told that there was a single server for the dining room, so they kept it at half capacity.  So into the bar we went.\n\nPlease, friends, do not go to Milos if you are either hungry or have anything else on your calendar for the afternoon.  From walking in the restaurant, it took 45 minutes until we were served our first course.  Although we were ready to drink, we were never asked to order beverages.  Eventually a server asked us if we had any questions about the menu, after we had read and re-read it and were long-past ready to order.\n\nAlthough we were in the bar area, the cocktail managed to hit the table just after the first food course arrived (i.e., 50 minutes).  This although we saw the bartender make the same cocktail for another table soon after we had ordered.  Bread arrived soon after, which meant I stared hungrily at a meze plate of mostly spreads for nearly 10 minutes.  At that point, I would have eaten it with a spoon, except that I had no spoon.  Nor did I have a napkin, until we requested them.  I am not sure if the meze should normally come with pita, but instead we received three pieces of hearty grilled bread for the table.\n\nSaving graces are that the food is good, and $20.11 is quite reasonable for the food.  The bartender was also friendly and did give us a round of wine with the main course to make up for our experience.\n\nWe had the scallops and meze, then the lavraki and salmon.  All were very good, especially the meze, although the \"steamed vegetables\" for the salmon were stringy, overcooked asparagus (and the salmon was farmed Atlantic salmon, but that's not unexpected at that price point).\n\nThe bartender told us that they had not been open for lunch that long (although three months seems like a while), and that their business had been skyrocketing, from 20 covers to 100 covers for lunch in a short time.  But previous reviews show the same issues happening at dinner.  Having multiple hours at the table to contemplate the state of affairs, the problem seems to lie with management not being able to run the floor properly.  We watched numerous staff huddles at the bar, the host station, and the kitchen.  Something was definitely being talked about, but it was not coming together to, you know, produce place settings, beverages, or food -- in other words, the things that restaurants are supposed to produce.  I have had more efficient service from volunteers at a church spaghetti feed.  But then you have to eat church spaghetti, and that's just not as good."

It was drizzled with their olive oil, placed on top of finely sliced (julienne??) onions.  It tasted just the way it was served: light and fresh.  Scallop was fresh alright!  Wish I had more than (2) pieces but then it would be a meal, especially for lunch!\n\nMediterranean Bass - Loved the presentation.  It was de-boned with the exception of collar bone and a few strays but what made me excited was the fact that the head was included!  A lot of people may be creeped out by it but I think it was great presentation - kinda makes you feel \"primal\" if you will.  The fish was steamed (it appeared) and drizzled with olive oil, capers, sea salt and a slice of lemon.  It tasted very buttery and the flesh was soft/flaky.  It didnt come with any sides but then again, you have a 3-course lunch.\n\nWalnut Cake: I didnt really care for it because I'm not a walnut fan but the cake was very moist.  \n\nOverall, they know their seafood here.

The bartender created a cool refreshing vodka cocktail of muddled cucumber, orange juice, ginger syrup and a splash of soda (at least that is what we think it was). We are continually requesting bartenders around the country to recreate such a refreshing cocktail.\nOur journey to our table passed us by the beautiful assortment of fresh fish, much flown in from the Aegean Sea. We ooh'ed and ahh'ed and had no idea that we would come back shortly to hand select our meal. Yum!\nOur table was near a wide walkway but the decor disguised the feeling of openness and our table felt intimate and private. Adjacent table were far enough away so as not to overhear other conversations.\nThe service was impeccable. There were 5 or 6 wait staff throughout the meal but we never really noticed them. We would just realize the water glass was continually full, but we didn't notice anyone fill it. Our wine glass was refilled as needed by never noticed the interruption. The empty plates would disappear without noticing hand reaching to the table. They never once interrupted our conversation. Impeccable service.\nAnd then, there is the food. Oh my, the food is to die for! We started with the infamous zucchini appetizer. What a fabulous way to eat your veggies!\nWe also enjoyed the fresh heirloom tomato salad. Yum!\nAnd then there was the fresh fish...we were escorted to the iced display and told of the various variety of fish and the different sizes. Since it was just the two of us we selected one of the smaller fish. When it was brought to our table, it was a beautiful fillet served on a platter and smelled delicious. It was just as tasty. We ate the whole fish! How could you not?\nWe didn't do dessert as we are not really dessert people.\nWe enjoyed a bottle of Greek wine which we found in a shop nearby Estiatorio Milos.\nAltogether, this was a wonderful experience to all the senses and we are looking forward to going back our next trip to Vegas."

The selections are varied and solid, and the portions are an admirable size.\n\nWhat really made me love this place was the patio.  It is obviously on the Strip, but surrounded by green ivy and plants to hide the hub bub and noise.  It's really beautiful out there.  The service was top notch.  One of those as soon as your done, they take your plate and scrape the crumbs off the table with that straight razor looking thing.\n\nBut some words of caution:\n- that price can sneak up on you realllly quick.  Some of the items on the prix fixe have an upcharge (like the grilled octopus - but so worth it) and their drinks are quite expensive ($16), so your $22 lunch can quickly become a $50 lunch.\n- I almost choked and died on a fish bone.  Like literally froze and thought my husband was going to have to shove his hand down my throat.  I ended up doing that myself in the bathroom.  Watch out for BONES in the bass!"

I tried the bagel and cream cheese with Nova Scotia Salmon. The salmon was rich and fresh and the toasted bagel was a lighter kind that seemed more like toast. My husband had the ($10.00) supplemental Maryland Crab Cake. It was the real thing just like what you really get in Baltimore. \n\nThe menu is mostly fish and some do have supplemental pricing.\n\nI picked the Greek Sea bass that they call Lavraki because they told me it was FRESH FLOWN IN EVERY DAY. They gave me a whole fish that was mostly free of bones very simply dressed and prepared to perfection garnish with a little fresh broccoli. The Honjake Salmon was prepared just the same and was also pristine fresh and melted like butter in your mouth.\n\nI welcomed the beautiful fresh fruit plate. I thought that was a very nice ending.\n\nIf you eat fish this place should be on your must go places  for lunch in Las Vegas."

I'm giving this place one star and I didn't eat or drink there.  How does a fair critic pull THAT off?  Read below and I'll think you'll grok how.\n\nI brought my sig other and parents to this place, hoping for a Greek meal of some sort.  What we got was basically a Greek 'fish house', which for my vegetarian partner in cuisine crime, negated the point of going.  The idea that hummus and such was 'passe' took the Greek out of the Greek for her.  But putting that aside --\n\n-- why ditch a lovely restaurant in the Cosmo for being a fish house?  Simple:  they attempted to scam us.\n\nWe sat down at a table and we were not brought menus.  Instead a nice waiter type arrives and informs us of 'how things work'.  That he would walk us over to the on premise 'fish store', we'd pick out some fish, and he'd guide us on their prep.  \n\nThe question that should be gnawing at you now is, wait, what if you don't mind meats but don't want fish?  Is there ANYTHING ELSE on the menu besides fish?  Why yes, of course, but the waiter gave you the impression he'd rather not go there.  That you'd kind of be a loser to not be in a fish mood in this Greek fish 'emporium'.\n\nDo you feel that at the back of your neck yet?  That something seems off?  Let me give you another hint:  the waiter waxed poetic about how all their fish is flown in fresh.   At first this sounds impressive.  Until you remember you're in the Mojave Desert.  And you remember that nearly all fish everywhere is flown in from elsewhere.\n\nSo we insisted on seeing the menu.  And guess what?  The prices were THRU THE ROOF.  An $80 rib eye.  That's even high for strip standards, people.  Trust me, there were no pearls or diamonds offered as side dishes.  So we finally walked over to the fish in ice market, which were all about $60 a pound.  \n\nAsk yourself what magical tricks MILOS could possibly have to make fish worth $60 a pound?  Unless they offered a belly dancer under the table offering exotic lap dances there's absolutely nothing special about olive oiling fish and grilling it.\n\nListen -- I understand if a place wants to be a high end restaurant and experience.  The decor and the way you are seated/greeted should make the four dollar signs perfectly obvious to an innocent visitor.  It wasn't so obvious.\n\nOne way to make it painfully obvious is to drop the menus down immediately.  What MILOS was instead attempting was carpet salesman sleezeballery.  \n\nThat's why we left..."

I don't use all caps very often in my reviews so this place is really something special.\n\nEven the bread they serve (which is toasted over an open flame and has a slight burnt taste to it) is really good.   Combine the bread with the Taramosalata (Hummus blended with fish roe, olive oil, and lemon) = MIND BLOWN\n\nThe crabcake was probably the best i've ever had (it's like 95% crab and 5% cake)\n\nThe charcoal grilled octopus was really good and would have been amazing if it had just a tad more charcoal flavor\n\nThe Lavraki Mediterranean Seabass was also really good and would have been amazing if it had just a bit more char on the skin\n\nThe walnut pie and Baklava were both sub par and I would advise against them."

When I vacation in Spain and Portugal, I eat octopus at least once a day and Milos is the only restaurant in the United States who can replicate my experience. The way it's tenderized and then grilled for that perfect light crunch outside and tender meaty inside makes my heart pitter patter. Inventive wine list with many spectacular Greek wines ( hey, they did plant grapes before the Romans and French) freshest fish in the desert and great staff. Great for special occasions. Expensive but worth every penny. They have their own signature Greek olive oil that enhances their simple grilled bread and pretty much anything. I know this because I've bribed the waitstaff on more than one occasion to look the other way when I steal it ( they won't let you by it)"

I'm a huge fan of this restaurant in its NYC location, unfortunately this Vegas location experience was ruined by the service. It took them over an hour to get our salt baked fish which usually takes 25 minutes. The initial reaction was that they were timing our portions, when we raised the issue to the manager his response was it was a wrong oven setting and we are either going to \"throw the fish in the trash or give it to you\". I remember when a manager was supposed to handle these situations with class and dignity and make the customer happy. This manager assured one thing, I'm never coming back to this establishment in Vegas, might even effect me going to their locations in NYC and London."

I'm talking about the prix-fixe three-course lunch for $20.12 at Estiatorio Milos.  Bargain-hunters, rejoice!  (Also -- big thanks to Jewelyn T., who tipped me off about this place!)\n\nI had the opportunity to visit Milos after a few hours of sweating it at the Boulevard pool, when I decided that it was time for something light and fresh.  I sauntered over to Milos, which was almost completely empty on a Sunday at lunchtime.  The vibe is bright and airy, in contrast to the darker and more intimate restaurants in the Cosmo.  The scent of fresh fish permeates the place, which really helps set the Mediterranean mood.\n\nI was flying solo for this meal, so I took a seat at the bar -- which I had all to myself.\n\nOrdering the prix-fixe lunch was a no-brainer.  Here's a run-down of what I had...\n\n**COURSE 1**\nTomato salad with cucumbers, onions, capers, and feta.  Did I mention that I was looking for something fresh?  Well, folks -- this is freshness distilled.  Every component of this salad was perfect, and made me feel like I was on sitting on a terrace in Mykonos.\n\n**COURSE 2**\nGrilled Mediterranean sea bass (lavraki).  This sea bass was cooked whole, ensuring that the result was succulent and tender.  Lemon and capers provided just the right amount of acid and salt.  Simple and delicious.\n\n**COURSE 3**\nGreek yogurt martini with raspberry sauce.  Another wonderful refresher.  Unlike a boring ol' ice cream sundae, the Greek yogurt provided an excellent tang that contrasted with the sweetness of the raspberry.  The consistency of the yogurt was outstanding.\n\nThroughout lunch, I was taken care of by Buck, who was probably the friendliest and most attentive server/bartender that I'd encountered all weekend.  He always kept my water glass perfectly full and was kind enough suggest his personal favorites on the menu.\n\nAll in all -- a flawless lunch at Milos!  I can't wait to try again.  Hopefully I'll be back soon -- I wouldn't want to wait 'til it costs $20.13!"

LOVED the saut\u00e9ed octopus dish which had sliced, huge pieces of octopus seasoned and cooked with veggies. The perfect chewiness and consistency for this dish! \n\nSaganaki is a traditional Greek dish of fried or usually served flaming cheese. I'm not the biggest cheese fan so this dish lacked tasted for me but I could still tell the quality of the cheese and the way it was prepared was the perfect oooeyness. \n\nWOW favorite part of this restaurant was the fish market where it's literally TONS OF fresh fish, seafood, etc for you to handpick and have prepared for the table. We picked a meaty white fish called (I believe) el dorado of the sea and it was a delicate white fish that was tender and just melts in your mouth. It was prepared with clean flavors of herbs and light spices and the fish flavors and quality spoke for itself.\n\nSCALLOOPS -- wow never had fresh scallops still served in its shell before. For 50 dollars a pop, totally worth it! It came prepared open in its shell with the tongue attached. Really appreciated the freshness of the scalllops and how the restaurant chose to ,again, let the flavors of the seafood speak for itself rather than added seasonings.\n\nBaklava for dessert and of course you can never go wrong with baklava :)"

The zucchini appetizer- super thin, lightly fried zucchini chips served with a cool, creamy tzatziki and a couple bites of saganaki. I could eat two of these by myself, but they are also great to share with the table for a starter. \n\n2. Octopus appetizer- one of the best octopus dishes around, period. More of a traditional mediterranean style, grilled with lemon and spices, always incredibly flavorful and tender. \n\n3. The $25 lunch special (+$10 for upgrades to Octopus appetizer or Lamb entree)- just a great deal, and a nice way to enjoy some of Milos' fare without breaking the bank. The downside is that this menu is quite limited (also recommend skipping the bagel/lox app- doesn't bring anything to the table). \n\n4. Dessert- their yogurt and honey dessert and a light, slightly sweetened, whipped version of greek yogurt with a berry sauce. The karadopita is also excellent- personally, I recommend getting and sharing both. \n\n5. Other dishes to try: any of the dips, the lamb entree, and the Lavraki.\n\nThe service here ranges, from friendly and attentive, making the experience that much better, to less friendly, more why-are-you-here, which can be a bit uncomfortable.

As for my second course/entree, my favorite is Lavraki, grilled Mediterranean bass; it comes plated as an entire fish or half of the entire fish.  They take the time to remove the fish bones and present the entree as on half of the entire fish!  It is seasoned just perfect!  My second favorite is the Nova Scotia Deep Lobster pasta, but I definitely encourage anyone to try all of the dishes!  Now comes the best part of the meal...DESSERT!

LOL!!!  They also participate during Restaurant Week and again, the menu selections are excellent!  I can't stop raving on how wonderful this restaurant is and definitely worth spending your gambling money on!"

I was incredibly unimpressed by the food overall, and most likely won't bother coming back. \n\nI understand the concept of a tasting menu, but the portions for the price on this particular menu were a little absurd. Typically, I'd expect at least 2 decent sized bites offered but on a few of the items ordered by my companions, it seemed like there was barely a full bite on their plates. I tried 3 items before we decided to head over to Secret Pizza. \n\nCalamari: the best thing I had here, but still by far not the best calamari I've ever had, which is what I expected it to be at around $9 for a handful of pieces.\n\nFried Cheese: forgive me, as I don't remember the menu item name. 3 very small pieces of cheese. It was okay to me, but seemed to be a huge hit with the rest of my party.\n\nMini Gyro. seriously mini. take your 2 thumbs and stack it on top of each other. Very little meat served on this dish. The cucumber salad served with it was better than the gyro itself. \n\nI felt like the food was just okay but for the price was a bit absurd. For the sake of their guests, I hope their main courses offer more flavor than the tasting menu did."

The meal was outrageously expensive (even more expensive than when we went to Picasso - a 2 start Michelin restaurant) and the food was incredibly poor. I hesitate to say the food was terrible because it had no flavor so it couldn't have a bad flavor. Just nothing at all.\n\nOnce we were all there, our waiter took us over to their impressive display of fish which he then bragged were flown in fresh each morning from across the world. But all of these fish contained utterly outrageous price tags. By far the most expensive entree I ate in my many months in Vegas. Nevertheless, the leader of our group picked out two fish and ordered a bit of steak for the table as well. \n\nWhen the food finally came out - don't expect anything to occur quickly at Milos - there was just no flavor in anything. Both fish were as bland as could possibly be and there was still the occasional bone left in the fish. Are you kidding?! How can something so expensive have as much flavor as air and still have bones! Even the steak lacked flavor, but was at least cooked well.\nThe one good bit of food all night was the octopus, the one thing that had any flavor.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how the food was utterly tasteless.\n\nLet me put it this way, for the amount the whole meal cost, we could have flown someone to Greece, sent them fishing, flown them back, and cooked the catch ourselves and then had a meal with actual taste."

I paid $10 more and did the grilled octopus as my appetizer (worth it, one of the best things I ate in Vegas), and had shrimp and couscous with a tomato chutney, and had authentic greek yogurt for dessert.  Everything was really fresh and well-seasoned and we loved it.  It's on a higher-up floor and there are wall-to-wall glass windows so you have a great view of the strip.

I'm not quite sure why because she just stood there for a few minutes without even acknowledging our existence. My boyfriend had to ask her if it would be okay for us to eat there or be seated because quite frankly they looked closed and didn't have single customer in there. It was extremely awkward and we felt unwelcomed. \n\nHere are some feedbacks: \n\n1. The bread they served us was burnt. I'm not talking toasty, it was actually burnt and was not good at all. \n\n2. The water was poured into a beautiful wine glass. It was deceiving because the glass actually smelled like mildew. Almost like a dirty wet rag smell. \n\n3. We were the only 2 people in there at 4:30 pm when we placed our order. A table with a woman who apparently knew the restaurant owner came in a little after and placed her order. She got her food first and we didn't get our entrees until 5:20  pm. My boyfriend ordered the Greek salad and I ordered the lamb (medium) with asparagus. It took them so long we were over dinner by the time it came out and had to have it boxed. If they were actually busy and had customers we would understand but they didn't. They didn't apologize for how long it took either which I thought was entirely rude. We over heard the waiter ask someone why our food was taking so long but he never came to us with an explanation. The entree itself was okay but our overall experience I would have to give a 2 star. Not a friendly environment and not very particular for the price. There are a lot better Greek restaurants I would prefer over this one.\n\nHonestly, it was just a cold stiff experience. The service was awful and we dreaded being there actually. Nothing about the people who work there make you want to come back. We also ordered drinks and two starters and the starters were both dry and bland."

We were lucky enough to be inside but right next to the beautiful terrace overlooking the strip. The service was incredible, 4 different guys all over you the entire time (in a good way). Our food was fresh & delicious along with looking like a piece of art with each plate delivered. \nThe grilled octopus & veggies were the highlight. I was also pleasantly surprised with the baklava ice cream that I've never tried before, the honey drizzled over it was like no other honey I've ever tried!

It cost several pretty pennies, but it was a neat experience fit for a special occasion. \n\nWe returned to check out the $20.11 three course lunch special available Monday-Friday noon-2:30pm. \n\nWhen we arrived a few minutes past noon there was a growing line outside the restaurant. The servers were running behind and we were told as soon as they finished up the meeting of the minds we would be seated. Just as we were about to walk away (we had limited time), they began seating. We opted for an indoor table since it was a bit warm - hmmm, only about 104 - and we were warned that the misters weren't operational as they had recently caused a flood.\n\nWhen we were seated the booth was sprinkled with crumbs. Not something you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber even if we were in for a special. \n\nWe noshed on grilled bread and olive oil while we waited on our first course which wasTomato Salad; a great summery dish. Light and refreshing and Shrimp Saganaki; think bruschetta with shrimp and feta. Very tasty and the shrimp were perfectly cooked.\n\nNext came our entrees Lamb Chop; extremely tender and well- flavored. However, the sides were not notable. And Lavraki; flaky, lightly seasoned. Overall, a nice preparation. On par, with the fagri we had before (at a much higher cost).\n\nAnd finally dessert, Walnut Cake and Greek Ice Cream; very nutty cake rich with spice. I liked it best with the ice cream. \n\nThis really is one of the better deals running right now. This lunch special is a great way to sample the refined Greek cuisine that made Milos famous."

            "review": "As we ate our lunch, the table was divided over whether our experienced rated an optimistic  four stars (me) or three (everyone else). Unfortunately, the dessert course took it down rather than up. It's a good value for lunch, and the majority of four- and five-star reviews seem to be based on lunch experiences that emphasize the value: at $25.15 per person for a three-course pre-fixe, it's not bad. But it's not great, either. Diner who opted for the $16 wine pairing thought neither selection was particularly interesting, YMMV.\n\nAPPETIZERS: Table bread had a light char on it that infused a slightly burned taste, fellow diners were divided over whether this added to or detracted from their enjoyment. Would appreciate herbs added to the decent-quality dipping oil. The mezze platter features various dips and crudit\u00e9s, the hummus was one of the best local versions I've had with a great texture. The tomato salad was simple and tasty but went unfinished with our group. The crab cake ($10 supp) was extremely good, but also unexpectedly tiny. The much-hyped grilled octopus ($10 supp), which I'd most been looking forward to, was well-flavored but disappointingly overdone and tough. I was bummed to see the scallop and calamari options visible on their website were not on the available menu.\nMAINS: The sea bass lacked seasoning but was perfectly cooked, broccoli side was unremarkable. The shrimp saganaki lacked flavor and the shrimp themselves were overcooked and cold instead of hot, fresh, and juicy. Lobster Pasta ($15 supp) has beautiful presentation but received mixed feelings at our table: I enjoyed the light tomato sauce while others found it bland and complained about the lack of lobster content and flavor in the dish. The chicken skewer was nicely seasoned and juicy but fairly boring, however the fries were spectacularly well done and paired well with the tzatziki sauce.\nDESSERT: We didn't finish even half of any single dish from this course. The Greek yogurt was the only decent item, and had great texture, but could have benefitted from additional fruit garnish rather than a single berry and a drizzle of compote. Would have preferred this with honey and walnuts, as it was previously served. The fresh fruit plate looked like the dismal remains of a business meeting buffet. The walnut cake and ice cream was a dry, flavorless mess topped with an icy, flavorless glob. \n\nI like the option to do the pre-fixe but if nearly a third of the available options incur a fee that then doubles the price, why bother? The dishes are fresh and appealing, but the trend of overcooking-and-underseasoning dishes is a basic execution error I don't expect to encounter on the Strip. Meal for four with coffees and  tip averaged to $50/pp and was underwhelming to all, which negated the \"great food for a great value\" claims that brought us in for our visit in the first place."

I had a friend visiting from another country and we wanted to have relatively nice dinner. Unfortunately, most of the high-end restaurants were completely booked.\n\nService was rather slow. The waiter finally took our order around 825pm and he wasn't necessarily friendly. I usually don't like seafood but upon strong recommendation from our waiter, I decided on the least fishy (?) fish they had on display. Our appetizer came out shortly but we kept waiting for our food forever. I started getting worried because we had a show to attend afterwards. Around 9pm, our waiter came and told us our food would arrive in 10 min. After 15min or so, our waiter brought my friend fish but not mine. He was unapologetic (I don't think any apology came out of his mouth and even if it did, it was not sincere) and told me that the kitchen lost my fish and perhaps I should share my friend's dish. Umm. what? I don't eat seafood much so I declined. And what kind of solution is that? Then our side dish came and it was a wrong order... We were cutting it so close to our show time that I just told him to bring a check. I was irritated but still fine at this point since I didn't have high expectation for seafood. The waiter talked to the manager and comped our wine (2 glasses). The waiter was super cold and aloof at this point becase he probably didn't want to deal with potential angry customers.\n\nWe left the restaurant and while I was waiting for my friend to use a bathroom, the whole experience started to piss me off. So I walked into the restaurant again and asked for a manager. The first thing he sad was \"But we comped your wine.\" And he said it with \"what more do you want?\" kind of attitude. First of all, you made me miss Christmas dinner/sit through 90 min show hungry and thought that I would be happy with free 2 glasses of wine? But I didn't need more comps. I told him that we owed what we ate and would gladly pay. All I wanted was for someone to take accountability and at least give us a sincere apology. Once the problem/mistakes started, it was obvious that they wanted us out. The manager repeated exactly what I said like he was reading phrases off of a manual with such nasty attitude. At this point, I thought it was pointless. I decided to take the high road and just walked away.\n\nMilos ruined my Christmas eve and I would never return. I hope that the management hires someone with more common sense who can at least treat customers with some respect."

Delicious nonetheless, but certainly not what you get at this upscale Las Vegas eatery. \n\nYes, Milos is fancy. Not pretentious fancy, but they do have linen tablecloths and fancy art on the walls. Because it's Vegas, you don't necessarily have to dress up to dine out here (you see it all!) but I wouldn't want to come in here wearing jorts and a cutoff t-shirt. Just sayin'. This is the type of place where you could show off your hella proper table manners ;)\n\nApparently this spot gets pretty crowded at night, so we came here for a late lunch. It was not busy at all! In fact, we were one of two tables seated in the entire restaurant. I felt kind of bad for our waiter since he was obviously wanting to chat with us, but kept his distance as to avoid being annoying. \n\nThe prix-fixe menu is definitely the way to go. As many have mentioned, it's a good deal for the amount of food you're served. Definitely go with the grilled octopus as your first course - it's quite spectacular. I've always liked this eight-legged food, but have really started to appreciate it over the last few months. I had the shrimp as a main course and it was also delicious. For dessert, it was the yogurt martini. IMHO, Greek food is not synonymous with dessert, but this was about as good as you can get.\n\nWe were in and out within an hour, although we could've stuck around much longer. I would imagine that this would be a place to take business clients or a good friend for a midday meal. Or if you want to call ahead a few weeks in advance, go here for dinner. It's classy, good food and excellent service."

Lavraki did have alot of bones, but we were okay with that.  I feel like alot of olive oil is added after, which i think was a little bit of an over kill.\n\nDessert:\nYogurt Martini & Fresh Fruit.  These desserts aren't anything fancy, but i will say the fresh fruit was really...um...fresh. Lol!  watermelon, honey dew, cantalope, grapes, strawberries, cherries, and a pineapple.  Yogurt Martini is just plain greek yogurt with a strawberry like sauce.  i eat greek yogurt every morning, so i should have went with the Walnut cake, but read so many poor reviews i couldn't do it.\n\nI would go back for lunch again.

Three round lunch special for about $25? I'll take that.\nGet the Yogurt for dessert!"

Stone walls combined with classical music. Stone and wood flooring. It is a combination of Greek and classical style. A unique hybrid.\n\nThree course meal for $22.13 comp'd by cosmo! Their reservation system was down so we got 100 dollars in credit for the inconvenience. \n\nThe scallop appetizer was quite simple with clean flavors with the strong aroma of the grill. Pretty bland but the emphasis is on the aroma. Grilled octopus, was flavorful and strong. I don't normally eat octopus, but it was okay. Greek Meze plate was so-so.\n\nThree of us friends shared three main courses together. First was the Lavraki, a grilled Mediterranean bass. Tasted fresh from the sea! Colorado USDA prime lamb chops was my favorite of all three. Most flavorful and also most scarce. Shrimp saganaki had a tangy tomato flavor and worked well with the couscous.\n\nDessert we got the fresh fruits of the season and the \nGreek yogurt. Fruits are just fruits, but the yogurt was fabulous.\n\nReally good customer service. Portioned off our fish for us at the table when we let them know we were sharing. Small portion sizes for each course and it filled my stomachache moderately by the end of the meal."

His answer to everything seemed to be \"get up and have a look at the fish market\"\n\nI want to know about flavor profiles of the fish....not see them dead in a bed of ice. What can a person ascertain from this besides a loss of appetite??\n\nUgh.....we let him choose 2 fish for our table and they were both nice fish, but definitely not anything id want again. The 2 filets of fish i did receive had numerous bones in it which i found to be pretty unacceptable. The 2 women at the table got pretty nice cuts of fish, but the other gentleman and I had to spend half our time picking out small bones.\n\nThe crab cake appetizer was the standout dish for us.....it was sweet, flavorful, and had little filler and a LOT of crab meat, It was large too, about the size of a baseball. \n\nWe also had the fried veggies (milos special) with the cheese i cant pronounce.....the cheese was great but there just wasn't enough of it!\n\nDrinks here were fairly priced, and the house greek white wine was good...recommended by the sommelier (who was personable, helpful, and nice)\n\nIt would take me winning the lottery to come back, and id probably stick to a steak or some veggies and crab cakes."

For about $20, you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I chose the Greek meze plate for my first course so that I could try all the different spreads. All of them were very good, and the pita served with them was nice and warm. The tomato salad is also excellent. For my entree, I got the whole lavraki, and that was the star of the meal. It's perfectly cooked, and served with a simple lemon wedge and steamed vegetables. For dessert I had the \"real Greek yogurt,\" and it was definitely the best yogurt I've ever tasted. The whole experience was top-notch and I wouldn't hesitate to return to Milos next time I'm in Vegas."

For $20, you get a 3 course meal that is fit for a Greek King. Forget the app and dessert, the true star is the Mediterranean whole-grilled sea bass entree. \n\nNothing sings to me more than a beautifully filleted fish, grilled to perfection, with lemon salt-pepper and olive oil. Pair it with a nice glass of Pinot Grigio, munch on some flame broiled home made bread and stare out from the incredible patio view and you realize from a local's perspective that this is why people LOVE LAS VEGAS!"

Plus, it was not a real bagel, but rather one of those big bready rounds. The cream cheese it came with was boring.  The Greek Meze plate had 1 olive, 1 slice of salami, 1 piece of manouri cheese about the size of dice, a miniature grape tomato, a small spanakopita type item (that was good - nice mint flavor), 2 cucumber slices that came with a terrific tzatzika-style sauce (the sauce on the cucumbers was great) and another sauce that was sort of like a baba ghanoush (that was boring). \n\nThe salmon entree was particularly good, well cooked and good quality fish, that came with broccoli which was also well prepared.  The shrimp saganaki included 4 large shrimp that were well prepared in a tomato sauce which could have used a bit more zest and flavoring.  It came with Israeli couscous, which was OK; it was a little mushy. \n\nDessert was a mixture of strawberries (some fresh and flavorful), blueberries (tasteless), 2 blackberries and 2 raspberries (both fairly tasty), a piece of pineapple and a 1/2 a clemintine.\n\nHad a good greek rose and a german reisling. \n\nService was particularly slow at the beginning, which was odd because it was not that crowded and there were a lot servers (all men)."

The bass comes with head and bones - accidentally  swallowed a small bone, and I'm used to eating fish that way. It was a very small skinny bass. Kinda bland- all I tasted was the lemon juice. It was ok. I ordered the fruits for dessert- u would think u would get good quality fruits. Nope- it came with one small wedge of pineapple ( not sweet), 15 grapes, one slice of orange, 3 black berries, 2 slices of strawberries. The only thing sweet was the grapes- the sad platter of cheap fruits. I would not come here again. Service was ok- seems like service is good only if u order drinks.

Classy layout and presentation, Delicious food, but not so addicting that I would become a regular.  (inside of the new Cosmopolitan Hotel!)\n\nThe restaurant itself looks cozy from the outside, but quite spacious once stepping inside.  The waiters are forced to wear ridiculous blue checkered tablecloth-like shirts with bright yellow ties, which my friends and I agreed need to be changed to something sleeker.  Despite the outfits, they are incredibly personable, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Some $$$$ restaurants have snooty waiters who make me feel intimidated/uncomfortable, but I did not get that vibe at all here.  Our waiter was attentive, the food was served in a timely fashion, and there was hardly any lag time at all during our meal.  \n\nBefore ordering, we were given a mini tour of the fish display to allow us to decide which fish we wanted to order.  It is a rare fish display to see in an American restaurant, and of course I took a picture in front of it haha.  Our waiter helped us pick out our fish based on what kind of flavors and consistency we wanted.  (We went with the Lavraki - fattier/more flavorful than a sea bass)\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Milos Special (\"Paper-thin zucchini and eggplant are fried crispy and served with a tzatziki sauce and graviera cheese saganaki\") which was really well battered, fried, and prepared.  The zucchini and eggplant were well complemented by the fried cheese and yogurt.  We ate it in about 10 seconds.  We also ordered a tomato salad simply because I was craving tomatoes.  The salad was delicious, but nothing spectacular.  We also considered ordering the 3 lb. whole fish because it is a prized menu item (\"The Lupe de Mare is cooked in sea salt in order to keep the fish as juicy as possible. The cooked fish is finished with hand picked sea salt from Kythira Island, extra virgin olive oil and capers. The fish is served whole at the table for our guests to share\"), but we decided that 3 lbs. was maybe a bit too much fish since we were ordering so many sides.  So, we opted for a 2.5 pound fish instead.  The fish was really amazing - grilled with some olive oil, lemon, pepper, and whatever else was on it.  The flavor was so delicate and light that you could still taste the flavor of the fish itself, which I find is not so common in America.  Americans seem to love their fish doused in butter and sauces that sometimes I can't tell if I'm eating fish or chicken.  But, this fish was so light and rich in flavor that my friends and I agreed it was worth getting again.  Plus, the skin was grilled to the point of perfection that it was crispy but still greasy and fatty.  Along with the fish we ordered sides of brussels sprouts and spinach.  Both were great."

We had great fun being taken by the waiter up to the fish and told about each one and their flavors.  We started with the Milos Special appetizerl.  The fried zucchini tower with tzatziki.  We couldn't stop eating it and almost filled ourselves up. When we were trying to decide which fish to order, the waiter suggested that we each have half of the two fish we were interested in.  That really worked well.  We had the Lavraki (a sea bass) and the Tsipoura.  They were both cooked to perfection.  We were seated where we could see into the kitchen and enjoyed watching how they grilled the fish.  The preparation of both fish was light and refreshing. The sea bass was a mild fish, and the tsipoura was a little firmer with more flavor, but both were really good.  We shared a piece of baklava for dessert which was very good.  It was a great, enjoyable evening, and the wait staff were so attentive and helpful."

The salmon was very good, the lavraki was a rip off and I don't use that word lightly. The lavraki was full of bones and was about 8 ounces (not one pound which is what they said it was) and cost $54. It taste like any other white fish. Nothing special and defiantly not worth $54. The sides are extra. I had the kale and it was very good.\n\nMy suggestion is to eat appetizers at the bar. The entrees are crazy expensive and not worth the cost. I agree with the reviewer below that said this place is a tourist trap and not a real Greek restaurant. The waiters are more like salesman. \n\nAll in all I would go back again for the tomato salad and the olive oil which is the best I've had outside of Napa."

When our party of 9 arrived we had a short delay being seated but nothing close to the wait we had next door at STK the night before - maybe 15 mins tops.\n\nThe waiter took our orders promptly but that's when the problem began.  It took almost 45 mins to get our calimari and our tomato salad.  An hour and a half later we told them we were leaving without having our entrees.  The waiter stammered about the restaurant being busy (we were one of only a handful of tables left occupied in the restaurant at midnite - nowhere near as full as when we arrived).  We waited a couple of minutes for the two orders of fish and a rib eye to arrive.\n\nSince we wanted to get to the club sooner than later we inhaled the entrees and bailed.\n\nThe manager had to get involved and they took 20% off the tab but the damage was done.\n\nBtw - the fish (forgot which two we ordered) was very tasty.  The rib eye was way below average.  The rib eye was ordered medium and was delivered very well done.  An order of Lamb was ordered well done and arrived very rare ( I guess the chef just couldn't bear to  serve it well done but what's their excuse for overcooking the rib eye?)"

We sat outside and couldnt wait to have a light, fresh fish meal. It was a disappointing experience. A Greek seafood restaurant but they were out of fish. Here's how it went down: they give you a 3 course price fixed menu for $20 or so. You get to pick one appetizer one main and one dessert. I ordered the scallop skewer appetizer, the salmon main course. My co-diner ordered the octopus appetizer ($10 up charge) and the Bass main course. The waiter comes back and they're out of scallops and out of salmon. So my appetizer choices are now a crab cake, octopus or a hummus platter. And my main courses are a chicken skewer, lamb chops or tuna burger. I went with the octopus and chicken skewer. Mind you I advised them under no circumstances was I paying the up charge for the octopus to which they complied and the chicken came with fries which I don't eat. Plus it was just a chicken skewer I could've made at home. The octopus was absolutely delicious as was the yogurt martini for dessert. I had a piece of my friends bass but it was loaded with pin bones. Bummer as I had really high expectations for this place. I only give it 3 stars because the octopus and dessert were so good otherwise it would've been 2."

Nonetheless, there are some gems in Vegas and I believe this is one of them. The service and food were fantastic. Because the restaurant receives fresh fish daily, your options will diminish the later you book a reservation. The anchioves, octopus, and lavarki all stand out.

It's more like a Myli's than a Milos!!\n\nI love octopus and eat it all over the world and have never paid $32.00 for octopus of any size. This was an appetizer which came out COLD,  we sent it back. Second octopus was inedible chewy as rubber, possibly the worst octopus of my life.\n\nNext we order the fish tasting appetizer.  Very good to excellent but at 82.00 for 16 pieces of sashimi that they should serve with a pair of tweezers and surgical magnifying glasses so u can see and properly handle the tiniest pieces of fish u can imagine.\n\nBread and olive oil r great. Greek salad was pathetic with mushy tomatoes, one olive, yes one olive in a salad for two. Feta was of poor quality also. So bad I refuse to classify it as Greek! It was left half uneaten. We didn't want to send another dish back to appear like nasty tourists so we just left it on the table.\n\nWe go pick out our fish, a Greek snapper of some sort. Came out dry as sawdust!  That went back. We had no choice it could not be swallowed with out risk of solidifying in your throat like some cemeticious  marine leak stopper that u slap in a hole instantly stop leaking water coming out of it. \n Well at this point no employee of Milos restaurant is talking to us.

When we were done with the fish we sat there forever it seemed like we were in Quarantine with the H1N1 virus!\nFinally ordered coffee and no mention of coffee on the house for your miserable dinning experience, \n\n\n\nI am giving this a DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON warning.\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID.

But the concept is different and needs to be explained to people who come here instead of letting them figure out things on their own.\n\nI came here with a large group for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant itself is very pretty...it's an interesting space and they have an outdoor area which I would have loved to utilize had it not been so hot out. \n\nWe were handed the wine list by a manager before our server ever made it to our table...so by the time our server had come we already had our bottle poured out for us...which is weird. We also asked for it to be kept over ice at the table, but that never happened.\n\nOnce our server finally made it over, he asked us if we had been there before, to which we replied \"no.\" He then asks us if we would like to see the fish market and, since we have no idea what this very important fish market is, we instead say \"no thanks we'll just look at the menu.\" Well, it would have been useful if he had explained to us that the whole concept of the restaurant revolves around the fish market and that this is a family style restaurant...\n\nSo, after struggling to understand the menu, we realize we need to view the fish market. Okay. So our whole group goes over and the server lets us know what kind of fish they have. Instead of telling us what the fish is like (ie buttery and tender or flaky, etc.) he just goes over the names and suggests a few for us. Okay cool. We order two different fish, some appetizers, and some sides. Our sides and appetizers come out intermittently before the fish. Very weird. \n\nI really liked the way they brought out the fish and the presentation...but honestly, there was nothing outstanding about the fish to justify the high price point. Yes it's flown in from the Mediterranean and yes that's a very cool concept, but honestly, I probably would not go there again for dinner. I am fine dishing out the dough for a truly great culinary experience, but this restaurant just didn't do it for me."

Instead, the three of us shared the grilled octopus for the appetizer, sea bass for entree, and their dark chocolate Nutella flourless cake for dessert. Everything tasted great and dishes were perfect sized portions for three people.The octopus and sea bass were cooked very well, both prepared with lemon, olive oil and capers. Some people have complained about the bones in the sea bass but they were removed when it was served to us. We also ordered wine and the bill came out to $100 each including tip. \n\nIf you don't order the signature dishes for the entree, you can walk over to their little \"fish market\" and choose something else to be cooked up for you. Thought this was interesting. I would definitely come back and try something  from there. Love how everything is fresh!"

The pita was hot and baked fresh. It was also served with bread and olive oil which were quite good. I had the Mediterranean Sea Bass which was a whole fish in a light sauce with capers. Good flavor. The walnut cake for dessert was good but the texture was a bit odd for me. Overall a great deal and a delicious meal. The Mezze was my favorite. Would definitely return to try the other options."

I assume you get more lamb chops at dinner (...I hope you get more lamb chops at dinner) but why not give them a try at lunch first?  \n\nNote: The drinks menu is not discounted at lunch.  My husband had a $22 lunch and a $16 mixed drink.  So it goes.  \n\nBut overall, we were pleased.  Thumbs up."

You can almost feel the breeze of the Mediterranean ocean as you dine.\n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS (+10 more) - the sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus was grilled to perfections with the smokiness showing through every crunchy bite. They were able to cook it before it became chewy. The portion size was larger then what I expected, but then again I am paying extra for this dish.\n\nLAVRAKI - grilled Mediterranean bass, this dish was simply made with salt, pepper and lemon\n\nYOGURT MARTINI - tart yogurt with a sweet raspberry or was it strawberry drizzle on top.

I could've played hockey with this lil sesame covered object. I'm not sure if the bagel was stale or if it was just not meant to be tasty, but me and one of my friends ended up devouring our slabs of smoked salmon with the complimentary bread that was served in baskets...that bread was warm, fluffy and tasty.\n\nFor my main course I went with the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean seabass) which I believe was grilled in a delightful mix of lemon, butter and olive oil - this was DELICIOUS. Each bite was amazing and even better when I squeezed fresh lemon all over it.\n\nFor desert I was saddened that they had no options in the vanilla or chocolate family so I went with their Walnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream...I'm not a pie person so I supposed I'm biased but I did not like this pie one bit and the Kaimaki ice cream was incredibly fragrant and tasted like dirt, which after looking \"Kaimaki\" up and learning that it's made using a powder made from the root of an orchid plant, makes perfect sense. Again, this must be an aquired taste...one I just haven't aquired.\n\nCocktails were great, no complaints there. Was tempted to give this place 4 stars, but really felt it was more like 3.5...so I'm giving it 3 stars because on Yelp that means, \"A-OK\" and that's exactly what this place was. A-Ok."

But watch out for the upsell on the appetizers- like 25 bucks or so for the calamari appetizer. They were pushing the upsell, and we didn't bite.

The food fantastic; fresh, simple and delicious.  The lunch menu is a great deal and the wine pairing ($16 for two half glasses, highly recommend) was very enjoyable.  We ordered the saganaki (fried cheese) off the meze menu (not on the regular lunch menu) - it was wonderful, deep fried I think and not soaked in grease like it can usually be, the lemon squeezed on top finished it perfectly, recommended.  For first courses we tried the meze dips and tomato salad, for mains the fish and shrimp, and for dessert the Greek yogurt (of course) - We would recommend all or any of that - it was all very good.\nOur waiter was wonderful, welcoming, knowledgeable, kind and attentive.\nThe letdown came in the timing which I'm not sure who to fault .... Kitchen or waiter.... But it was rushed and unprofessional.  When we first sat down (12:30 pm) our waiter asked if we had any time constraints, we told him no that we would like to have a leisurely lunch.  It should be noted the restaurant was not even 1/2 full the entire time we were there.  We ordered the saganaki and hesitated ordering the rest of the meal as we did not want to be rushed, but our waiter assured us he would not put our lunch order in until our appy was done, which he did oblige.  The problem came when we were finishing our first course our main arrived, and the service staff literally sweeped in moving our first course plates out of the way to make room for our mains.  So now we're put in a position where you have to decide if you want to finish your first course while your main gets cold or just start eating the main.  For this calibre of restaurant I found that extremely disappointing.  Furthermore I saw the same thing happen to at least 2 other tables around us, and they had the same bewildered look we did.... There's no way I can give even 4 stars when diners are faced with that sort of issue leaving you uncomfortable and rushed, it completely takes away from the rest of the what would have been wonderful lunch.  Nonetheless, go for the food."

I was feeling like I wanted to try something I had never tried before - and not being a big red meat eater - the $50.12 dinner menu offered by Estiatorio Milos seemed just the ticket.  They also offered a Sommelier pairing of wines from mainland and northern Greece for $20.00 which we went for.  What a deal!\n\nCourse 1:  Carpaccio of Mediterranean Caught Fish with fresh herbs, citrus, afrala sea salt and extra virgin olive oil from the island of Crete.  A beautiful little starter.  The fish sliced paper thin and dusted with Sea Salt and EVOO. The fresh herbs lent a distinctly lemony flavor to the dish, which was really nice.  The salt makes it though.\n\nI really enjoyed the fact that our servers were willing to take the time and explain the dishes to us - a little background on the chef and sommelier here - where the ingredients come from, their personal opinions of the dishes.  Super fun!\n\nCourse 2:  Charcoal Grilled Mediterranean Octopus with roasted sweet peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.  I'm not a big octopus eater, I've been underwhelmed by its texture in sushi restaurants - but after reading the Yelp reviews of this dish, I knew I had to give it a try once more.  \n\nOur server admitted this was his favorite dish on the menu - I couldn't wait.  I have to say, this dish lives up to its reputation.  The octopus was crispy-charred on the outside and so tender on the inside.  Again, sea salt made an appearance, really bringing the charcoal flavors to new heights.  The mushrooms wittily echoed the texture of the octopus, which I loved.  Praise the Goddesses, I could have just been served this dish all night and I would have been happy.\n\nCourse 3:  Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass from the protected waters of the Greek Island, Kefalonia and horta vrasta and ladolemono. The Bass (aka Branzino) was served head and tail on de-boned for the most part except for the collar.  Another wonderful dish with clean Mediterranean flavors - a nice balance of EVOO and lemon in the ladolemono.  The horta vrasta (Boiled Leafy Greens) were reminiscent of spinach - something that I can't take too much of at one time for some reason. \n\nCourse 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  OK - the walnut cake was really nice. I think the waiter and the sommelier were enjoying the fact that we were intrigued with the traditions that surrounded the ingredients and the dishes we had been served...and so, Skinos. Our waiter joked with us that it was going to be something out of the ordinary and he was right.\n\nSkinos is a traditional liqueur made from the resin (or mastic) of the Mastiha tree that dates back to the ancient world.  It tastes, well, piney - in three stages. A single sip rang out with pine, then licorice, then sweet. Pine, then licorice, then sweet.  Totally intriguing and odd at the same time. The Kaimaki Ice Cream also has some derivation of mastic in it as well - so its flavors echoed the Skinos. Nice. Finished the Skinos and left happily sated and buzzed.  All in all a great meal, served by a totally friendly and wonderful staff."

The other day was the first time I'd ever had a negative experience but it wasn't due to the food. \n\nMy sons father and I and our 3 year old were walking around the Cosmo. We were hungry and it was close to 7 so we decided to eat at Cosmo. He had never tried Milo's before so I told him he simply had to. Since we'd been running around doing errands we weren't exactly dressed up but I mean who really cares? It's Vegas. We walked into the restuarant and went to the hostesses and asked if we could get a table for 3. I apologized for not dressing up, saying how normally I did but we'd been running errands all day. She literally wrinkled her nose and stated that they were fully booked till 930. But if we wanted to wait we could. I mean, this bitch didn't even try to hide her look of disdain. Maybe it was the yoga pants and tank top, maybe it was because I had my son. Who knows but whatever the reason she said they were fully booked. \n\nWe walked out of Milo's and I laughed and said she was full of shit. Pulled up Milo's in yelp and went to make a reservation. There were 6 different slots available before 930. I promptly booked the 730 slot then proceeded to call. When she answered I asked to speak to her supervisor. When he got on the phone I told him what happened and he assured me that there was no dress code and that they didn't discriminate. He was very nice and professional and apologized for her rotten attitude. When we walked back in at 720 they didn't even ask to see my reservation. She sat us promptly. We ordered drinks and went up to the fish market and picked our fish. I picked the sea bass and he picked the sole. Our son was looking at the fish horrified so I ordered him the filet since they didn't have chicken on the menu, I lied and told him it was chicken/steak lol. \n\nThe service was wonderful and we ordered the Milo's Special which is always a favorite. We munched on the bread and out son was enjoying his soda and the special. \n\nShortly after our order the manager came to our table to apologize for the mix up. He was so nice and even brought us a little taster of the sashimi which was amazing!!! Melted in our mouths. \n\nAfter we had finished our food was brought out and mine was light and buttery and flaked perfectly. So good! \n\nHis was firm and had a great texture and a light lemony taste. You can really tell the fish is fresh. \n\nOur son had his first steak and ate every bit. He kept telling us his his chicken steak was so yummy for his tummy. \n\nAfter we finished our dinners we sat for a little longer and he ordered a drink. After he finished I ordered us the baklava. When it arrived it was light and sweet with fresh honey dripping from every bite. We ate it so fast I thought I was going to see my food again lol. It was that good. When I asked for the check the manager brought us out 2 after dinner shots. I don't drink but I appreciated the gesture. My sons father drank them both though and he said they were great with a really distinctive taste. Overall I love Milo's just could do without the 2 cunty twats that were hostessing that night. They should've hidden their looks of disgust better and then maybe I would've believed that there were no open tables but their lack of professionalism and inability to hide their expressions gave them away. They are the reason for the 4 stars because otherwise I would've given them 5."

            "review": "This was the restaurant that the No1DP and I went to celebrate our one-year anniversary. I first heard about this restaurant as a suggestion made by another Yelper and I told the No1DP to \"take me here on our anniversary\". Definitely a keeper.\n\nCONCEPT: This restaurant is one of five Milos restaurants from Costas Spiliadis. \"Estiatorio\" is a type of Greek restaurant that specializes in grilling but doesn't grill up just standard \"taverna\" fare. What the Milos family of restaurants are known for is their dedication to bringing in fresh fish from the source. Yup, they actually FLY THE FISH from the Mediterranean or from the East Coast. This is why most of the fish is sold at market prices. Upon request you can also shop at the fish counter to select the fish that would be served to your table.\n\nVENUE: Located in the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, the same floor as Jaleo, Blue Ribbon and Secret Pizza. Look for a door with \"Milos\" on top.\n\nThe restaurant layout combines the rustic terrace dining one would envision when dining in a Greek estiatorio or taverna with the opulence and style of 21st century Las Vegas. When you walk in there's no mistake that you walked into a fine dining establishment but the space looks and feels more like a fancy dining hall. You are going to know your fellow diners quite well - with our wedding party talking and even singing it felt as if the No1DP and I were treated to a performance at the dining room table. \n\nI'm not sure what was going on at the floor above but there was enough activity that caused the floor to shake at the beginning of our meal; the No1DP thought there was an earthquake going on at some point. \n\nSERVICE: Excellent, as it should be for fine dining. The waiter, bussers and sommeliers were dressed similarly. It looked to be quite busy for a Saturday late night as it took forever for the sommelier to serve our wine - it was not brought out until sometime AFTER our fish was served. We informed the waiter about this and he felt really bad about the situation. He promptly brought our wines and we were not charged for said glasses. The way he handled the situation was excellent; not once did he lose his cool.\n\nAPPETIZERS\nOysters ($4/oyster): There were a few types of oysters when I ordered, a sweeter/creamier type as well as a saltier/briner type. I picked 2 oysters of both varieties. A raspberry vinaigrette accompanied the sweeter oysters and a salty vinegar accompanied the brinier oysters. I found out that i prefer the sweeter oysters as I appreciated the texture of the oyster rather than the briny water soaking it. \n \nMaryland Crab Cake ($32): Hand-picked, fresh jumbo lump crab. The cake was slightly smaller than my palm but the cake consisted mostly of fresh crab and tasted rightly so. No1DP says that this is the 2nd best crab cake he's ever tasted with the best one actually being in Baltimore. I don't have any comparison so for me this was the best.\n\nMAIN COURSE: ~1lb Sea Bass. When ordering your fish you can have it prepared in several different styles. No1DP asked for our fish to be steamed. This portion was quite big and was lightly seasoned with herbs, lemon and capers. You can taste the freshness of the fish, No1DP says that it's like tasting fresh fish back in Japan. Sea bass is supposed to be a \"tougher\" fish but I could still easily cut the fish apart with a fork. Though the fish is filleted we were warned that there could still be bones in the center.\n\nOur white wines went well with our fish.\n\nSIDE: Grilled Vegetables ($31): Eggplant, Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Baby Fennel Cipollini Onion, \"The Real Greek Mint Yogurt\" & Haloumi cheese. This was the best grilled vegetable dish I have ever tasted. Looks like this dish was grilled and buttered. The veggies were very soft and kept their flavors. The Haloumi cheese was tough enough to taste like meat. It went VERY well with the yogurt. \n\nDESSERT: Chocolate Sin, \"the famous Milos Chocolate dessert from Athens\". This was a standard chocolate cake but it was still delicious.\n\nThanks to Liv K. for making this recommendation! I'll definitely spread the word that this is one of the good restaurants the Cosmopolitan has to offer. Supposedly according to many a Yelper they have an awesome lunch special..."

He said the Red Snapper only feeds 3 people so we should get two orders of it.  We told him that we only wanted one order and if we were still hungry we'd order another one.  Food was okay not the greatest.  \n\nWe got our bill and the f***ing piece of fish was $200.  We felt like we got conned.  There was nothing on the menu that was even close to costing $200 so how were we supposed to know it cost that much.  We should have complained to the manager but we didn't want to cause a scene in front of a lot of people.\n\nI've had better fish at the floating market in Bangkok that only cost me $100 Thai Baht ($3 USD).  What if we listened to our con man waiter and went with two pieces of fish?  He would have charged us $400?  I'm never going to this place again.  I recommend to anyone who goes here to order only off the menu because they will screw you if you get the \"special\".  And yes I went back to check their menu and its not on there.\n\nLast thing.  It took us 20 minutes to get our bill.  Maybe they were debating in the back whether or not we would be stupid enough to pay $200 for a piece of fish.\n\nP.S. I don't understand how everyone on this page is giving them 5 stars.  They must all work there or something."

The only slightly negative note is that their food runners don't seem to know the tables or seat numbers that well because they look somewhat confused as they run food out and it distracted me from my 100% enjoyment by just a tad. That said...\n\nMy love had the Greek dip platter, the bass, and the walnut cake.\nI had the Feta and Tomato salad, the salmon, and the greek yogurt.\n\nBeing Asian, I have an excuse to share everything with my love and eat \"family style.\"\n\nGreek Meze Platter: Three different dips; Tarama was garlicky, packed full of flavor but not overly salty. I like when flavor isn't mistaken for a heavy hand in salting. The Tzatziki is the best I have ever had with a creamy and thick texture freshened with cucumbers. The Htipiti was so full of a roasted bell pepper flavor, mixed with thick Greek yogurt to make any plain pita canvas fill with color and delight. Manouri cheese, tomatoes and a few Kalamata olives completed this delectable treat, truly the epitome and definition of what \"appetizer\" is.\n\nTomato Salad: DON'T let this simple name fool you. If you love olive oil, you are in for a treat. Their extra virgin olive oil is not only extra virgin but of a fresher and higher grade of olive oil than even some of the best olive oils I have had when in Italy. Their Greek spices don't disappoint and complement the oil so well. The tomatoes are so well-dressed you almost feel underdressed. A triangular wedge of feta accompanies the salad. The feta is  a good backdrop for the true stars of this salad ballad: tomatoes and olive oil. Bravo!\n\nLavraki: The bass, of course, has the most value. It has a good head (yes, I love fish heads, cheeks are the bomb diggity, yes, that's what I said!) on its shoulders and the meat is seasoned well. Simple and well done. Beware of bones. Enjoy the broccoli and squeeze some fresh lemon on your fish if you like. \n\nHonjake Salmon: One-inch thick strip of salmon that glides right off its salmon skin goes well with or without lemon juice, the same broccoli that accompanies the other fish dish, and tastes yummily fishy-fatty. Omega-3, gotta thank the Alpha and Omega for this fish.\n\nWalnut Pie with Kaimaki Ice Cream: Mmm.... You just need to try this for yourself. Shall I torture you any further using descriptions to say that the moisture of this cake, essentially, is so lavishingly divine that the ice cream is almost, almost an afterthought. Oops... \n\nYogurt Martini: Nobody in their right mind should ever go back to low-fat yogurt after having fat-full yogurt. Anyway, back from that quick tangent, the yogurt was whipped with powdered sugar, and strawberry pur\u00e9e topped the yogurt with a couple of fresh blueberries, which make you look back at their fresh fruit-and-vegetable display. \n\nMilos has several different locations: Montreal, Athens, Miami, New York, and luckily for me, Las Vegas. \n\nI wonder if all of the locations have that same grilled bread they served at the beginning, before the meal. That bread was... worth mentioning, just like everything else. \n\nThe check came out to $43.50 for my love and me. For mouthwatering thoughts, that's well worth the price. I almost wish I were a tourist so I could go back home somewhere and brag about this meal. Instead, I'm yelping about it. Cannot wait to have another free afternoon to go back for their awesome lunch deal."

Let me tell you: do not skip put on the seared octopus. I'm no expert but I'm sure they got the texture right.  It was not rubbery, had a nice char to it, and was salted appropriately. Absolutely tasty!  My Dad went for the crab cake, that too was great. It was more crab and less breading, delicious. If you're wondering if the up sale for the lamb is worth it, it is. It too is cooked right. Taste, presentation, etc, are great. The fries it came with were also delicious, crunchy outside, soft inside, salted and seasoned well. \n\nFinally, dessert, this was the only part that wasn't 100% for me.  I loved the taste of the walnut cake with ice cream, but it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. The yogurt was good too, but I will probably opt for the fruit plate next time. That's right, this place is so good I'm already planning my next trip back! \n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go get some lamb!"

I don't care to walk around at a nice dinner I just want to sit and relax. we decided to get a calamari which was average, a Greek salad which was amazing best thing we had, and the grilled octopus which was nothing to write home about. 3 of the girls got swordfish which was very fishy tasting and tasted really oily. The other girl got the steak I believe the filet it was $67 and we all agreed we could have something better at home! We tried a lot of great restaurants this weekend and this was the worst! None of us were impressed. I honestly if I have the choice will not come here again."

Reservations made by our Hotel Concierge, who shared that info, tho did not know until we came and the hostess acknowledged it.  We  were immediately seated. Now mind you, been to Milo's in NY, (the waiter asked if we were familiar with the restaurant-said yes) so of course, expected the same service/food as NYC. Surprise, not a chance!  Service wasn't bad, but but far from excellent. Perhaps because we did not want to pick out our fish, the waiter was put off but we were fine with him doing it.  \n\nOrdered: Fried eggplant/yogurt good, have had better.  Med bass--did not do a good job de-boning, but had flavor-once you took the bones out of your mouth.  Did not ask if we wanted coffee or dessert.  \n\nWhen I asked for the check, the first waiter turned to my sister to wish her a happy b-day, when I paid, the other server acknowledged it.  You knew and did nothing to make it an experience?! Perhaps checking how the food or engaging us would also been nice  But since we were not there for a convention or other business reasons, (it was a week night, do not believe patrons were leisure travelers) perhaps they figured they'd never see us again. \n\nTold friends and colleagues our experience--and as one person said--Vegas makes its money on the hospitality industry, the people who work there just are not hospitable!  Did not find it in any of the other restaurants we ate at. But certainly did at Milo's!  And when we left, no one said good night or thanked us!\n\nJust a thought--don't take your guests for granted!"

We weren't planning on coming here originally, the original plan was to go to the Bacchanal Buffet, but after the ridiculous ticket wait time and line to check in, we gave up and decided to go to Milos, where we know the food and dinning experience has always been wonderful. It was actually a blessing in disguise. We were seated immediately. The seafood is fresh. The grilled octopus is the best I've had and the most tender. The filet is also wonderful, I had mine cooked medium well and it was still so soft and tender but cooked exactly to my liking, might be the best filet I've had by far. Also had the best bagel and lox in the past. They have 3 course prix fix menus for lunch and dinner, both are very affordable at 25.15 for lunch and 45.15 for dinner. All the choices are delicious and always have been stuffed and satisfied after eating here. Even my picky uncle, who doesn't like to explore other cultural foods loved this place, we were all in shock, just to show you how good it is here. Yorgoh, who is Greek, is  the nicest serve and truly has a passion for the food here. He explained to us how he has a passion for the food here because it is so authentic and close to how food is cooked and prepared in Greece. My family already have plans on eating here again before we leave Vegas."

The ambiance is nice as with most restaurants in the nicer hotels in Vegas but that's about the only positive thing I could say.  \n\n1.) This was one of those places where there are lots of waiters running around but nobody seemed to be paying attention to us from the moment we sat down.  \n\n2.)They call themselves a Greek restaurant but the only authentic dish we had was the tomato salad (which I actually really liked).  We ordered the baby broccoli but it was very bitter tasting, I couldn't even eat it!  Complained to one of the waiters but he kept making excuses for it and didn't even tell the head waiter.  A good restaurant with good service would notice that a dish was not eaten and would ask if there was a problem.  We asked the head waiter to take it off the bill and he reluctantly did but then made excuses for how it tasted again!  I don't care at that point, if it taste like crap, you should accommodate the customer.\n\n3.) When we sat down, the waiter asked if we wanted sparkling water and we said no, regular flat water is fine (assuming it would be tap water) but he never said \"its bottled water, is that okay?\"  So we get the bill and they charged us $24 for bottled water!  same thing with the broccoli, waiter made excuses for it but reluctantly took it off our bill.\n\n4.) We ordered the whole white fish which was market price but they never explained it the price was per pound!  the waiter proceeds to order us 4 pounds of fish!  I don't know anyone that eats a whole pound of fish by themselves.  We get our bill and the fish alone was $200 for 4 people!!!  You would have thought we were eating lobster and fillet Mignon. \n\nThis place is a total rip off with over priced menu items.  I live in San Francisco where we have some of the worlds best dining and have eaten at some of the best restaurants in Napa.  Those are real restaurants with longevity and good service.  This place is a typical Las Vegas hustle relying on tourists who are never going to eat there again.  Do not dine at this restaurant!  Horrible!!"

There were large groups of people waiting to be seated when we sat down and I am pretty sure most were trying to walk in. The restaurant is not very large and dinner takes awhile.  \n\nFun things about the restaurant is that the head waiter wears a chef jacket and you get to pick your own killed fish on ice.  Their fish is flown in less than every 48 hours from the Mediterranean.  They have all kinds of varieties.  \n\nI found the staff friendly and accommodating.  They did not seem particularly pushy but encouraged certain appetizers and menu selections.  \n\nI think that you have to want seafood if you want to eat here.  The fish we orderd was great but wasn't thrilling.  I didn't have as much fun as other restaurants I have been to in Vegas.  I would take business clients here and family.  I wouldn't go here if your were looking to be loud and drink and just have a blast, so no bachelor parties and the like.  I would eat somewhere else for that and then party at the Cosmo.

I thought the decor of the restaurant was very nice...open, elegant, trendy.  \n\nI have to admit, I was not very hungry, and was not feeling all that well.  It was our first day of the trip to Vegas, so we had dined, imbibed, walked, and shopped for far too long.  So, my point... I guess I \"sampled\" a bit, instead of going all out and ordering full courses.  My husband ordered a couple glasses of white wine.  I only had a few sips because...not feeling well.  I'm not sure what he ordered, but it was very good.  The receipt says \"Balada\", and I guess it must have been good at $52 per glass!  Kind of wish I would have drank the whole thing now, but the hubby didn't mind helping me out.  Then a bottle of red...Rocca Barbaresco at $214. \n\nAs for the food, we started with the Salmon Tartare.  It was delicious, but probably not a good idea after the champagne I had that afternoon.  Then we had...I believe...lightly fried eggplant, with some sort of light sauce like a creme fraiche or cheese sauce...not really sure.  Quite delicious as well.  Then, a first for me...grilled octopus.  I've had calamari before, but I guess octopus is a little firmer, and more difficult to cook.  It was quite good. The seasonings were light, grilled to perfection.  The mister was quite impressed.   Then we had a tomato salad with feta cheese, and the last course was a beautifully prepared fish.  It was served whole, butterflied...unfortunately I'm not sure what kind, as I was losing my stamina by this time.  I'm guessing some kind of snapper.  \n\nThe meal was really wonderful, the ingredients were very fresh, and the presentation was beautiful.  We asked to meet the chef.  He graciously accepted, and came out to speak with us.  He was a lot of fun, and appreciated our thanks for a job well done.  After dinner, we sat outside on the patio, and finished our wine.  A lovely ending to a very long day.\n\nI gave this four stars instead of five, because I just didn't feel the service was exceptional.  They were polite, professional, but nothing stood out.  And, when they offered to bring our last glasses of wine outside, one of them crashed before arrival, and there was no offer of a replacement.  But all in all, a great meal."

It seems like Cosmo's restaurants are really amping up the deals (we love CommeCa for lunch too). The ambience of the place is airy and sophisticated, which I really like. It's a huge restaurant with a lot of seating-- in fact, it felt sparse even though there were a good number of people at the restaurant.\n\nWe had the scallop skewer and the grilled octopus (+$10) for our appetizers. I liked both but wish my raw red onions were grilled too. I liked the lavraki a lot, and didn't even mind the tiny fish bones on the side (that the server kindly noted), and the lamp chops (+$10) only had a slight gamy taste. My dessert was a yogurt martini that was super rich, but I've never been a fan of desserts.\n\nSurprisingly, we loved the bread. It's nicely charred and comes with the most amazing citrusy olive oil. We requested seconds and thirds. We'll definitely come back and try other items on the menu."

It left me wondering whether they just use the same lemon-dill marinade for all of their seafood and call it upscale Greek.\n\nThe walnut cake was disappointing. It was bland, dry despite the ice cream served with it, and wasn't presented well aesthetically. \n\nI couldn't understand what the waitress was saying, so I don't know what wines she poured, but both were whites, a bit fruity but dry, crisp and light, which complemented the seafood well. \n\nBeing a celebrity restaurant in Vegas, it was well worth the price, but by normal standards, I wasn't wow-ed.

I can speak for my entire party of 15 when I say that we were very very very disappointed with this place.\n\n1) Service is terrible. There were so many servers walking around, more so than guests, and yet hardly anybody tended on us. We had to flag down multiple servers to ask for our check, because still no check after we asked several times. They were rude, too. Very short with us. We even noticed that when they were standing around not doing anything, they pointed at different guests and snickered or laughed. \n\n2) Food. Extravagant price for average tasting food. We ordered 1K of food, and it filled not one of us. It was like going through Costco and getting bite size samples of food- and none of it tasted special. We all left hungry. Did I mention we waited an HOUR after ordering before we received any of our food? I never do this, but I couldn't help but ask one of the servers how much longer our food was going to take. And of course when he said \"5 more minutes,\" it turned out to be 15. \n\nAfter dining here, it made sense that there were hardly any other people eating here being it was a Saturday night and during \"Spring Break season.\" We even felt bad for the birthday girl having chose this place for her, because we wasted HOURS of celebration here that we wish we could have gotten back. We all agreed that eating Fast Food through a drive-through would have tasted so much better, filled us up, and would have been worth our time. Don't waste your time here."

Estiatorio Milos is on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and is a large space with balcony dining and what appears to be an actual in-house fish market that sells fresh Mediterranean fish to the public.  However, had we checked the Yelp reviews of the place prior to making our choice, we very likely would've chosen someplace else.  Thankfully, we didn't go elsewhere!\n\nMost of the negative reviews for Estiatorio Milos cited poor customer service as it major flaw with lack of received value compared to cost as another concern.  However, most, if not all, of the poor reviews were for their dinner service.  Estiatorio Milos does lunch very well!  EM offers a three-course prix fixe lunch for $20.11.  I'm assuming the price will go up to $20.12 next year.  I started with the Grilled Mediterranean Octopus served with fava.  This selection has a $10 supplementary charge, but it was worth it!  The sashimi-grade octopus' tentacle was broiled to perfection leaving it nicely smoky, but still moist and amazingly tender without a hint of rubberiness or toughess.  It was cut into medallions that ranged from half-dollar to quarter sized pieces.  A great start to the meal!  Next, I chose the Lavraki with horta.  Lavraki is a Mediterranean seabass more commonly known as branzino.  The lavraki was grilled whole then de-boned prior to serving. The fish possessed a delicate, but delicious flavor and was thankfully adorned only by capers, butter, a hint of salt, and flat-leaf parsley.  It was accompanied by horta, a saut\u00e9ed swiss chard and spinach dish seasoned with lemon, olive oil and sea salt.  A great entr\u00e9e!  For my dessert course, I had the Yogurt Martini.  It was lightly-sweetened Greek yogurt served in a martini glass.  It was the least memorable of the three courses.  I washed down my lunch with a glass of the Katsaros Chardonnay.  It wasn't overly oaky and possessed a nice clean finish.  It went very well with my lunch, but was a bit pricey in my mind at $16.  A team of servers provided our service.  They were friendly, attentive, and thorough throughout the meal.  One note:  EM was not crowded at all during our lunch visit.  Therefore, the server to diner ratio was definitely in their favor.  \n\nI can't speak to what EM brings to the table during their dinner service, but it definitely left a positive impression on my girlfriend and me for lunch.  It was a solid 4 to 4.5 star effort!  I recommend Estiatorio Milos for your lunchtime dining consideration."

The problem is they charge by the pound and you really have no idea what the cost is so prepare yourself."

The sashimi tasting plate is delicious! The greek salad will leave you craving it for a week.\nThe staff is insanely good. You will never have an empty glass, dirty plate, or crumbs on your table.\nBe prepared for a more than costly bill. It is by far the most I have ever spent on food in my life. Worth going if you can afford it."

The seafood is extremely fresh and fulling.  The service is very attentive.  The ambiance is bright and welcoming.  I recommend this to anyone looking for good fresh Mediterranean cuisine."

We got the Tomatoe salad and grilled octopus which were both Ahh-mazing! My fianc\u00e9 ordered the lobster pasta and I got the shrimp. Wasn't too impressed with my dish but his was really good! When you choose dessert definitely get the Greek yogurt! We got Greek yogurt and the walnut cake! The walnut was over spiced...won't be ordering that again! Overall the atmosphere is super nice and such a beautiful restaurant!"

However, when I have to give a rating based on price, food, and service, it's hard for me to justify that Estiatorio Milos is more than a 3 star restaurant.  If the prices were all 50%, I could justify a 4-5 star review.  However, the food did not meet my high expectations, and the service fell below.\n\nWhenever i have greek food, I compare it to Evvia in Palo Alto.  Evvia is by no means a cheap restaurant, but in comparison to Estiatorio Milos, they are giving the food away!  We ordered the Octopus and the fried zucchini as appetizers.  The Octopus was NOT as good as Evvia, but the Fried Zucchini / Eggplant was delicious.  Very highly recommended.\n\nFor main dishes the table shared an order of the lamb and and one of the fish from the \"market.\"  Unfortunately I don't remember the type of fish, but it was about $60/lb (about 3lbs).  With regards to the lamb, it was actually the 3rd (last) best lamb I had that week. The lamb at Table 34 and Giada was much better, and less expensive.  \n\nThe fish was good.  We ordered it baked in Salt for the extra $15.  The waiter left a few bones in when serving.  It just was not worth a $180 fish to me.  \n\nWe passed on dessert that evening.  By no means is Estiatoria Milos a bad restaurant.  However, in my eye's it was just A-OK.\n\nService was nothing exceptional.  The waiter just went through the normal motions, didn't do anything that felt out of the ordinary, and just felt very \"by the book\" (but not a NY times best seller)."

The d\u00e9cor is quite lovely, very bright and crisp, it reminded me of all the little white buildings in Greece.  The service was totally on point and everyone that came to our table was friendly and accommodating.  The lunch menu allows you to pick an appetizer, an entr\u00e9e and a desert so I chose a crab cake, lavraki and Greek yogurt.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The entire dining experience was wonderful and left nothing to be desired."

Originally, they said no waiter service in the lounge, but after we ordered drinks and a few appetizers, and moved to the big table, they let us order dinner.  Tomato salad, spread sampler, tuna tartare, and mushroom appetizers were all very good. Ribeye, white fish (fagri), and grilled veggies were all very good."

We even had to call back and push the time further and they had no problem with it. When we arrived (3 pm on a Sunday) there was plenty of seating available but I would still recommend making a reservation just in case. \n\nI had the 3 course meal for $25 and for a place as nice and fancy as this, I thought it was a great deal. I read some reviews that people had to ask for the prix fixe menu but we didn't have that issue as it was given to us without asking. \n\nFor my appetizer I had the grilled octopus (extra $10). It's honestly the best octopus I've ever had from anywhere. That alone is reason enough for me to come back. It tasted fresh and had just the right amount of chewiness to it. \n\nFor my entree I had the grain fed chicken breast skewer with grilled mushrooms and onions, and served over pita. The chicken had a lot of flavor and I was pleased with the plate overall. \n\nFor dessert, I had the karidopita (greek walnut cake) with kaimaki ice cream. It was really sweet for me but I still enjoyed the flavor. The ice cream helped balance out the sweetness. \n\nI would definitely come here again for the lunch and I'd like to try the dinner. Perfect place for a nice date!"

            "review": "On the weekdays, this place is like a power lunch mecca - lots of suits and ties gripping their vodkas, and just as many suburbamoms gossiping over martinis. I took Mama K out for a ladies' lunch on her recent visit to town and she was over the moon. The $22.13 prix fixe menu was a hit, and we both ordered different items each course to try as much of the menu as we could with the exception of dessert, which my server got her on board to order the yogurt like I had. \n\nFor the first appetizer course, Mama K ordered the fresh diver scallop skewer and I the octopus, which is an additional $10. The scallops were large and juicy, and well complemented by the couscous, while the octopus - dang, where do I start? It didn't even taste like octopus, and in a good way! It wasn't chewy like I'm used to, and instead it was soft and tender. \n\nOur main entrees were the lavraki - grilled Mediterranean bass for her, and the Honjake salmon for me. Both orders of the fish were done just right; there was no overly fishy taste and they were still moist inside. The lavraki did contain bones - I'm used to eating fish like this, but even so I don't generally see this at Western restaurants. \n\nDessert for both of us was a thick Greek yogurt that was not very sweet, but had an even balance from the fresh strawberry and berry topping. \n\nOverall, a success! Our server was a displaced nomad from California who was easygoing and well-versed about the menu despite having only just started working here. The only reason I had to take off a star though, was because somehow he felt comfortable enough to tell us that here in Vegas, he only likes dating \"foreign girls\" because \"they never stay long and eventually leave.\" No, no, no. You did not just tell me and my mom over our lunch about how you like to hit it and quit it."

Went for their lunch special, 3 courses for merely $22 with additional charges for premium dishes.  \n\nDecor is earthy with beautiful stone walls and wood floor; the openness provides a welcoming atmosphere for diners.  I ordered the grilled octopus for starter and sea bass as main, and finished with fresh fruits.  The husband went for the decadent lobster pasta with succulent lobster that was delicate and flavorful.\n\nEverything was absolutely delicious and fresh.  If you're like me, who appreciate seafood that lets its main ingredient shine rather than smothered in sauces and overpowered by seasonings, you'd love Milo's."
