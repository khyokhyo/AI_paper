            "review": "Vegas is a lot like Miami Beach. Lots and lots of touristy restaurants with bland food and high prices. The staff stands out front and lures you in only to drink you into disappointment. \n\nFortunately with Public House, that was not what we found. In fact, I totally fell for this place!\n\nWe had been checking out the Venetian and Palazzo and hunger suddenly hit. Most restaurants were pretty quiet as it was a bit late for lunch.  We browsed a few storefronts before deciding on Public House. Perhaps we were drawn into to the dim lighting and the hip Americana decor. We sat in a plush booth and our server greeted us right away. She very friendly and inviting.\n\nI had already eyeballed the Chicken Sandwich on the menu so I just had to order it. It was a grilled chicken breast topped with sliced ham, grain mustard, and cheese. Perfect texture and delicious! Paired with good ol' natural cut fries. All around very good.\n\nI have to say I was really happy with Public House. I'd even say it was my favorite meal on the whole trip. I even tolerated the cheesy humor on the restroom walls. Be sure to find your way to Venetian if you want to check this place out!"

            "review": "We decided on this place for drinks and food before going to see Rock of Ages, it's right there so we could leave quickly if necessary to get into the show, and they had a sign out front advertising Happy Hour specials.  \n\nHappy Hour is only form 5pm-6pm.  So we didn't get much in the way of specials.  I checked in on Yelp and we got a free House Draft Beer.  It was good, but normal price is $10/pint.  I was getting Vodka & Lemonade (was cheaper during HH, had one at HH price), those are also $10.  Weak, it was more lemonade than anything else.  I know, it's Vegas, that's what they do, that's why you should not get mixed drinks in Vegas.  But that's what I wanted.\n\nWe also got the Poutine, it was pretty decent.  Not as good as a poutine you would get in Canada.  But pretty decent.  We passed on the sunny side egg.  Not necessary.\n\nAlso split the Burger, which was very tasty, $19, came with fries.  The burger was very, very juicy, actually caused a wardrobe malfunction for my boyfriend, but it dried enough that it didn't ruin his shirt.  Passed on the Egg for the burger too.  Everyone wants to put a runny egg on top of perfectly good meals these days.  It's not always a good add-on.  \n\nWe spent $104 before tip, for some drinks, one appetizer and one entree.  It's not cheap, but it's in the Venetian, not Hooters.  So, it is what it is.  The ambiance is nice."

            "review": "Geeze Casinos these days are all molding together so fast i was pretty sure i would forget where i parked. Good thing i got back to the car on time.\n\nCask beer\n - Reading the menu made the Cask beer sound interesting and at 9 dollars it wasnt too bad. The beer of the day was called.....umm...cask beer...hell i barely knew what i was ordering. When the glass came i noticed the foam wasnt from carbonation but was from pouring. Initial taste was light and fruity and the follow up was of a dark beer. No surprise considering it was a darker beer. I took a sip Anthony M took a sip and we looked at each other. Then i said...LYCHEE BEER!! yeah it had a fruity aroma to it with some sweetness that tasted like lychees. \n\nPoutine\n - I've never had poutine before. I've only heard of poutines through EPIC MEAL TIME!! so what i was expecting was already warped by internet bacon. What came out was a classier version and not as heavy or as...umm...drenched as what i was expecting. The fries were EXCELLENT even without the cheese curds or gravy or duck the fries themselves were EXCELLENT. The dish was nicely balanced but could have used a bit less salt.\n\nPub Burger\n - After a few trips to Bachi Burger i was pretty damn sure i'd never truely enjoy another burger that wasnt from Bachi. Now i'm ready to revise that. For 'Fusion' Burgers Bachi still holds a special place in my heart through the form of cholesterol in one of my arteries and might kill me one of these days but oh well totally worth it. The Pub Burger is possibly one of the best american style burgers i've had in a while. The roasted tomatoes just add another layer of depth and flavors through it's sweetness and the gruyere cheese just blended nicely with the meat patty. Awesome totally awesome.\n\nFor the most part i try not to eat on the strip or at casinos very often as i prefer to support local businesses and stick to the more sane experience of dinning off the strip. If i did find myself anywhere near this area i would definitely come back and try other dishes."

            "review": "ALL HAIL NINKASI, this place is a craft beer lover's Heaven.  I've been searching for a great craft beer bar on the strip and I can stop the search.  Full stop.  This place is AMAZING.  Pricy?  Yes.  But it is so amazeballs you won't care.  First off, the beer selection is killer.  Not only are there great choices on tap, but there are also 150 (?) bottles available, awesome flight options, and a full bar as well.  Second, the food is indeed \"gastropub\" worthy.  Usually you see gastropub in the title and it doesn't live up to those standards...but Public House delivers.  I had the bone marrow and poutine appetizers and both were fantastic.  (I would have had the crispy frog legs too if they weren't out...hopefully next time.).  If I'm going to be picky, the poutine could have used more cheese curds and maybe a little more gravy, and somehow I ended up with an egg on top...but it was still delicious and I almost licked the plate clean.  And the marrow?  It was SO GOOD.  Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The restaurant is also pretty sweet looking...it's all dark and sexy but has an industrial feel as well AND it has a comfy living room feel in the front which was cool.  And the best part?  The waitress knew her beer.  It's so nice to be able to talk about IPAs with someone who knows their shit.  This will surely be a yearly Vegas stop for me."

            "review": "This has become our favorite low-key place to eat in Las Vegas. The service is almost always outstanding, the food is consistently great and they treat their locals well. \n\n They update their menu seasonally (both food and drinks) so it's always interesting to see what new things have been added to the menu. We've tried lots of things but keep wandering back to the pub burger; it's the best burger I've ever had in Las Vegas. \n\n Their cocktail list is extensive as is their beer menu; if beer is your thing, you can't go wrong here. I'm a fan of their cocktails; \"Death in the Afternoon\" and \"Sinister in the Fall\" are my favorites. \n\n Las Vegas has a bad habit of training hostesses to pretend to be bouncers and so many times I've felt unwelcome when walking into a restaurant; Public House is completely the opposite and their hostesses always greet us warmly. They also have the most polite food runners I've ever encountered. The waiters and waitresses are all fantastic too (we usually ask for Steven or Sarah, but you can't go wrong with any of them). The overall attitude here is so positive and I find it really refreshing; that earns it top marks in my book.\n\n *I mentioned in my previous review that they offer a locals discount, though I'll admit it's a little confusing about how much it is and when you can get it. I figure it's because locals are less common in a place like this, not all of the servers are on the same page about it (very forgivable). I believe that locals get 20% off (with local ID) Monday through Thursday, but it's best to ask beforehand."

The lounge area is great for appetizers and drinks. We sat in a booth in a dining room. They have very nice decor. I ended up ordering the French dip for lunch. It was a good size sandwich I couldn't even finish it. I would just wish the au jus would have now flavor but still very good. The season on the French fries are completely addicting I couldn't stop once I started. I had a bite of my boyfriends meatball sandwich and it was soooo good highly recommend. The service was fast, polite, and very attentive. This is a decent priced restaurant compared to what kind of casino it is."

            "review": "Another Public House! I came in for lunch with my sister, aunt, and uncle after reading all of the great the reviews, and this Public House did not disappoint! It is a nice escape from the escape of Vegas, amongst all the other amazing restaurants and shops in the Venetian's Canal Shops. We ordered the poutine and the foie gras to start and they were amazing! The poutine comes with duck confit and a poached egg on top which was the perfect combination with the gravy and cheese curds. The foie gras was, as expected, a very small serving, especially for 4 people to share, but it was also amazing and very flavorful. I ordered the porchetta, which I had been dying to try, but I was actually a bit disappointed. It was served on a french baguette and the pork was extremely thin so really all I could taste was the bread and the excess of arugula. My sandwich came with herb fries, which were pretty good. My sister and my aunt both ordered the pub burger with bacon and avocado and after trying it I was a bit jealous. I'm always very reluctant to order a burger since pretty much every restaurant in the world offers one, but this was really one of the best burgers I've ever tried. My uncle ordered the short ribs and he said that they were also excellent. Our server was very helpful and friendly and recommended we also try their white sangria, which was good but very very sweet so we ended up ordering from their huge beer list as well. I was happy to see that they have one of my favorites that I can't find anywhere - Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. Overall I definitely enjoyed my meal at Public House and would return next time I'm in Vegas."

While I didn't try the food, you honestly don't need to - the tap list here presented on iPads is RIDICULOUS.  A huge cheers to the owner for having the ability to serve a keg of Deschutes 2012 The Abyss HALF A YEAR after its release..simply unbelievable considering the sheer popularity of this limited annual release RIS.  The bartenders here are cool as hell too and able to relate to the beer geek in me.  Sure didn't hurt that they tapped both Firestone Walker's 2013 Parabola and 16th Anniversary Ale in the middle of my visit ;)"

Completely PACKED on a Wednesday night the wait was over an hour. We decided to sit at the equally packed bar and snagged a belly bar. Great beer and wine list. We opted for a couple of appetizers instead of a full meal. We went for the Poutine and Shrimp and Grits. Both were very good. Portions are a good size but very pricey $12/$18 respectively. Was so crammed that it was hard to enjoy our $12 beer and $50 bottle of so so wine. One thing I observed is this place was packed while surrounding restaurants were completely empty."

At only $16, which I'll consider a cheap lunch by Vegas standards, it was a quality sandwich!\n\nYou may think, it's just a chicken sandwich. You can't really mess that up but I'll have you know that I have had many boring chicken sandwiches. This sandwich had an amazing piece of chicken on it, smoked ham, provolone, and this slightly tangy beer mustard all between a pretzel roll. The pretzel roll itself was very delicious.\n\nThe meal also came with herbed fries that were simply amazing. Unfortunately, I couldn't finished all of them because the sandwich was so deliciously filling."

Maybe one day ...\n\nI can't say that this is a place that you'd go out of your way for when in Vegas ... but you might walk from nearby hotels to go here.\n\nIf you love beer, you can't do much better. Their selection was insane and the prices were reasonable.\n\nThe food is what really surprised me. A place that is focused on beer might just phone in their food selections. But this place had some great stuff.\n\nPoutine: Really delicious with loads of flavor. It could have used a touch more duck though. And the sauce was really salty to the point that the last 5 or so bites are saline to the point of pain. But other than that it is delicious in that hedonistic way.\n\nBurger: I REALLY wanted to love it but only liked it. I mean, Guinness aioli? That sounds deliciously brilliant. The burger just has SO much going on though. They need to lose a couple of the ingredients. But it's still good for sure.\n\nWe also had the pickles which were surprisingly tasty.\n\nThe only major problem is the sheer lack of velocity. Everything here happens really slow. Now I will say that our waiter was AWESOME. He knew the ins and outs about our drinks and the food. He kept an eye on us and was funny to boot. But there is just such a massive lag to get your food out it's absurd. This is not a place to grab a \"quick bite.\"\n\nIf you stay at the Bellagio or Palazzo then you owe it yourself to try this place. Just don't go if you're in a hurry."

The iceberg wedge was an insulting size, it was a half wedge of lettuce, (probably couldn't even feed a rabbit with it) add chicken on that thing and you're paying $19 for a half wedge with chicken strips. Not cool. The $19 burger was solid but it was cooked medium when I asked for it to be rare, and I was also given the wrong beer (Wasatch Pumpkin instead of the Dogfish Head Punkin). Service was pretty good though. Will not return."

She made excellent suggestions with the poutine and the bone marrow.  The poutine is very well priced, loaded with tasty duck confit, and I would recommend it with the egg.  I've surprisingly never had bone marrow before, and I quite enjoyed it with toast points and carmelized onions.  \n\nThe atmosphere is lively, but not over-the-top, and my water never hit the bottom of the glass.

            "review": "Along with LBS Burger, Holsteins, and The Barrymore, this restaurant is operated by Block 16 Hospitality which is for my money, the hottest group in Vegas right now and I would recommend all of their spots. This on is no exception. It is located in the Venitian right across from the Blue Man Theater and is a perfect spot to grab a bite before the show, as I did.\n\nThey are very proud of their beer list, but with places like the yard house for cheaper I didn't find it a particular draw. They do have a rotating cask ale which is unique and reasonably priced. They get a handful of casks and then move on to the next beer when they run out.\n\nThey claim they offer comfort pub food which roughly translates into very rich food. They have homemade pates and charcuterie which were very good but enough to share. The welsh rarebit is beer cheese on toast which I though could have been a bigger portion when it came out, but ended up being perfect after I was stuffed with everything else. They have devils on horseback which is the now ubiquitous bacon wrapped stuffed dates. They are popular for a reason. The poutine was topped with cheese curds, duck confit, and veal gravy. It was both as amazing and filling as it sounds. I could have eaten that and nothing else.\n\nI would definately recommend getting the house made pickles. It comes with pickled onion, cauliflower, and carrot. They were are very well done and the onion did not have a strong taste and did not leave me with horrendous onion breath. I would get these again because they were so good and also because they did a good job of cutting all of the other heavy selections."

The menu changed a bit, and favorites like the lamb meatballs were taken off. Most upsetting were the wings. They didn't look as good and they certainly didn't taste as good. No longer did the wings have the crispier skin or the delicious sauce. The new sauce tastes like there is a hint of cinnamon in it (gross) and more salt then someone would need to consume for a month. The skin was also mushy/fatty. My husband got the new duck confit reuben (meant to replace the lamb meatball sandwich) and it was a throw away. It wasn't good and it wasn't bad. It was substance. No one goes out and pays $13 for a small sandwich as mere substance (that's what bananas are for!). \n\nDear Public House - if this is because you fired the old chef/kitchen crew - then you need to bring them. If it's the same crew - then it's time to kick cans!!"

Being a very punctual person, I don't understand how could a well established restaurant not be ready until it was seven minutes past opening time. Anyways, while waiting we got bored so we started taking photos of the decorations (some cute figurines of Lincoln, Franklin etc for the kids), and the hostess announced our table was ready and rushed us to finish while insincerely saying \"I can waiiiiit.\" , tapping her foot at the same time. I thought she was about to yawn :(\n\nOur server was ok, not friendly, didn't care to ask if we have any questions about the menu, just very simple service. Hubby ordered the Lamb Meatball sandwich. I had the Prime Rib French Dip. Lamb was delicious, a bit too much tomato sugo. Prime rib was tender, thinly sliced, barely any onion.  The herbed fries that came with the sandwiches were soggy and extremely salty. Not acceptable at all especially when I am paying almost $20 for a sandwich, there's no excuse for the fries to be not crispy.\n\nWe also ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow. The sea salt was not evenly sprinkled on so upon first bite, there was no taste at all, and then there were parts that were super salty. Half of the toasts were burnt black. :( And to make things worse, the busboy spilled ketchup on me while cleaning up. There were absolutely no apologies or offering to clean my skirt. He did bring a wet towel if that means anything. \n\nI guess we should have left when we first entered, when the restaurant was not \"ready\" yet."

They have a very good beer selection on tap, as well as bottled. They can even make you a Bloody Mary with bacon, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro infused vodka. One of the bartenders infuses it himself. It also comes with a shrimp on steroids hanging on the rim of the glass. It was that big. Every menu selection I've had here has been great. The huge burger, pork belly sandwich, and French dip are a few of my go to's. A great appetizer or side is the poutine. Yes, poutine. You don't find that yummy Canadian dish at many places in the States, but they do it up well. I know this is a place on the strip in restaurant row between the Palazzo and Venetian, but I do think they could bring down the price on their beers though. Anywho, that won't stop me from returning."

Um being from Providence, RI, my expectations for Italian food is set very high. We walked by menu after menu and then took a look at the Public House. We changed our minds immediately, and grabbed a seat. They hand you an iPad with their Beer menu as a touch screen app. You needed an app for that! the beer choices are extensive and there is a beer for everyone. So that was cool and new but not the reason we stopped, the menu is amazing. We started with the Poutine... holy *#&!... thin french fries with duck confit and cheese curds with fresh gravy that was more demi glaze than gravy. If I didn't have reservations for a fancy dinner I would have ordered a larger lunch. I order the Pub Burger, hands down the most delicious burger ever. This description is straight off the menu: all natural grass-fed beef, bacon marmalade, gruy\u00e8re cheese, roast tomato, frissee, guinness aioli, w/herbed fries. \n\nForget all the sub-par Italian food and get your butt to the Public House!"

From the high tech looking beer tap set up, to the quirky signs in the bathrooms there are so many details that make this place special.\n\nWe first went the day after they opened for some of their many craft beers at the bar. We enjoyed the place so much that we went again the next day for dinner. I really appreciate Public House because of their attention to detail.  The decor is modern and has so many interesting things to notice. They even have some fun notes in the bathroom for you to see.\n\nThe beers, oh the beers! There are so many types and the taps run all the way from one side of the bar to the other across the ceiling in industrial looking piping. We checked out some football games on their well positioned TVs while listening to their indie style music mix.\n\nYou must get their Pork Rinds! These are not like the ones you get that are processed and sitting in a bag for months which leave that weird disgusting coating in your mouth. These are fresh and with a squeeze of lime they crackle and are perfect with beer.  We also tried their onion soup. It was really good too.\n\nWhen we returned for dinner I tried one of the barrel beers which is served at a warmer temperature than a beer is typically served. It allowed the full essence of all the flavors of my IPA to come through.  \n\n Both our appetizers were solid but nothing that special. We had the Ahi Poke and the Potted Egg.  The Poke was kind of plain but a nice portion of high quality fish.  The Potted Egg is hard to describe but is basically a creamy ricotta cheese sauce with a poached egg and wild mushrooms.  It may sound strange but is a nice combination of flavors. The only disappointments were our entrees. The chopped salad had way too much dressing and the dressing wasn't great to begin with. The pork belly wasn't anything special.  The meat's consistency was too stringy and the top of the meat was not as crisp as I would expect from a nice fatty piece of pork belly.\n\nConsidering how great everything was, including our service both times, I will write off the issues with the entrees. Plus, they had only been open a couple of days.  I'm looking forward to going back and try some more beers, but I'll probably just stick with their appetizers next time."

Sorry, getting a little judgmental.\n\nSpeaking of, when seated at a table for four (was surprised they sacrificed one for just me, a walk-in) I was provided an iPad which contained all the menus for all the beer. I didn't see anyone else with an iPad though, which I thought was peculiar. Frustration kicked in when I tried to order two beers and they were out of both. Why not have the menus update this information? Regardless, the \"beer cicerone\" was able to help me pick something comparable. They have many canned beers, which they take pride in. So what did I do? Ordered canned beer. Why not-it's Vegas.\n\nHad the Poutine for the appetizer (which was enough for one person's entree): thin, seasoned fries with duck confit, thick cheese curds, a sunny side egg and a gravy that the waiter poured on the dishin person at the table. He even asked me if I was ready (which spooked me a little-uh, ready for what?) This, my friends, was THE. BEST. POUTINE. Everything was perfect, especially that spooky gravy. It's also hard to find poutine stateside that has quality cheese curds.\n\nEntree was their version of Chicken (Quail) and Waffles: buttermilk fried quail and waffles served with greens with lemongrass butter and Moose Drool (a brown ale from Montana) syrup. It was ...good, but not great. I think I was just wanting fried chicken and waffles and not have to fight with quail bones (no fault of theirs.)\n\nFor my (and your) finale was a Chocolate Stout Layer Cake with Malted milk ice cream and, AND, caramelized bacon rice crispies. To be honest, the only, ONLY, reason I got this? To see what bacon crispies tasted like. I was already full of food and beer. I knew the chocolate cake was going to be rich and decadent and yes, the crispies did indeed taste like bacon.\n\nI waddled back to Caesar's a happy man."

Maybe I'll try their grilled octopus and crispy frog legs next time, but I was content with their Poutine, Foie Gras, and Roasted Bone marrow.  \n\nWe opted to start with the Poutine, which was a sharable, good size order of french fries smothered with duck confit and cheese curd (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA?select=_XDPdJuJcGJVCkFjJAakrw#6t8IoPUlK1zxUD2x45mK9g).  Their special gravy was good, but a bit heavy on the salty side.  I'd prefer it being drizzled lightly or on the side.  I'd probably add the fried egg to this dish on my next visit.  \n\nThe Foie Gras seemed a bit overcooked, but tasted excellent with the rhubarb compote (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA?select=_XDPdJuJcGJVCkFjJAakrw#wxY-6KQLsKq8r12CATB1bQ).  Since this dish will soon be extinct in the Golden state, I'd definitely come back just for this.  \nTheir Roasted Bone Marrow pushed my cholesterol level to maximum with their addictive bacon marmalade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3cHL1r5w2oLYH-veijtweA?select=_XDPdJuJcGJVCkFjJAakrw#3acRhIFzCfEF9Dc1wEJ5Mw).  The portions were prepared simply, yet full of fatty flavor.  \nI also had a taste of the Pub burger, and it was beyond okay with bacon marmalade....but I've had better.  \n\nStellar service and a ginormous beer list bumps my rating up to a solid 4 stars."

The Public House is one of those places.  It's OK for what it is, the food is pretty good and the prices are high (well, higher than they should be for a bar).  \n\nYeah, I know part of the high prices comes from the fact that this restaurant is also inside a hotel/casino, which makes it more expensive than other places, anyway.  But stuff didn't have to be this expensive.  Most appetizers were over $10 and the entrees ranged from $16-$30.  \n\nThe service was good, tables seemed pretty easy to come by (I ate here twice) and the portions were large.  The Poutine was a must-try, though I've had better elsewhere.  First time around, I ordered the pub burger, which was tasty with all of the add-ons I opted for .  Second time around, I had the fried chicken and it was really great but a huge portion that I couldn't finish and couldn't take back to my room with me.\n\nIf you check in on Foursquare, you can get a free beer of the month, which I was able to get twice.

I would imagine the bar area would be pretty jumping during a weekend night as they carry a significant number of beers from around the world and its perfect for beer drinkers.\n\nWe started our meal with crispy oysters with foie gras and it was delicious. The oysters (3) were on the smaller side, but it was a great one bite starter as the melted foie gras was pretty delicious underneath the oysters. We also had an order of pork rinds and they were great to snack on. \n\nFor our mains, we had the burger and the braised short ribs. The burger was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request and it was very juicy and had good beef flavour. The thin cut shoestring herb fries were good too. I'm from Toronto, and it ranks up there with some of the better burgers I've had here. \n\nMy gf had the short ribs and it was a big Wow for her. It was perfectly cooked and literally melt in your mouth good. It was accompanied by two fantastic onion rings on top of a bed of butternut squash puree. The short rib had great flavour and the jus it was served with made it the best short ribs dish my gf and I have ever had. \n\nThe service was very friendly and the waitress was very knowledgeble. We weren't sure whether it was mashed potatoes that came with the short ribs, but our waitress informed us that it was butternut squash puree. You'll be surprised to know how many waiters/waitresses don't fully know the menu, so bonus points for her from knowing her stuff.\n\nWith the Groupon coupon ($25 for $50) and one beer and a generous tip totally $40. So including the $25 we spend buying the coupon, it was easily one of the better lunches we had for $65. It's a great place for a relaxed lunch with reasonable prices.\n\nIt's a place I would recommend for a pint and a burger without hesitations. They have a few other items that I would be interested in trying including the poutine, friend quails and waffle and etc."

It was completely edible vs some places where all the marrow does not come off the bone.  It was nicely seasoned and the marmalade and bread were also excellent too:  5 Stars.  The octopus was outstanding.  It was way better than recently reviewed Black Hogg in Silverlake (LA).  The octopus was super tender, and the fried chickpeas and chorizo added texture and contrast to the octopus:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the poutine was the star of the evening and the perfectly cooked egg put this dish over the top!  The dish was nice sized, the fries were still crispy, and there wasn't too much gravy (poured on at the table).  This version was way better compared to Animal in LA:  5+++ Stars.\n\nTo drink, we had the Joseph James lager ($8) and a Speakeasy ($10).  The former is like a Stella (my go to beer), but w/ more malt.  The latter is a Belgian style beer, but not as sweet as some:  5 Stars for both.\n\nNicholas was an awesome bartender!  Not only did he introduce us to some new beers, he was also very knowledgable about the menu.  Lastly, he poured a tequila shot down the finished bone marrow for one patron.  The patron said he really liked it!  - 5 Stars.\n\nThe ambiance was very nice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  The clientele were chill, and there was a whimsical sign by the bathroom:  5 Stars.\n\nI will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas to try more dishes, or have the dishes we enjoyed on this trip.

The bartenders were really knowledgable, they gave really great suggestions. The prices weren't bad either.\n\nTwo downsides personally: First, the bar area was made small and gets crowded easily. Second, I wish I hadn't come alone so I could split one of their rarer, big bottles with someone else. If I ever stay on the strip again I know where I'm going back to!"

It was very nice and very chic but it was not too fancy. We were instantly greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. Our waiter was super cool- he saw my Groupon on the table and was actually excited about it. He was all, \" Oh great!! Groupon!!\" He took the time to answer our questions about the menu and made great recommendations for my friend and I. He was also very attentive throughout our meal. \n\nI ordered the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese to start. OMG. Amazing. They were a mouthful of warm, sweet, salty, bacony and blue cheese goodness!! For $6 you get 3 of them. I was tempted to order a second plate of it but I didn't want to ruin my dinner. For an entree, i got the organic free range chicken. The waiter said it wasn't really necessary to order a side bc it came with mushrooms and farro. It was SO good. The plate had 3 pieces of chicken on top of the farro with mushrooms and sauce. I forgot the name of the dish that my friend ordered but it was sort of like a shepards pie with a twist. There were 3 empanada/dumpling style things - this took place of the crust. And inside them was lamb mixed with a sauce and some veggies. And the 3 pieces lay on top of a potato puree with another sauce. I tried some and it was great and I don't even like lamb!! She said she really liked it. She also got a side of grilled asparagus which was also very good! We were both really really happy with our meals.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasurable dining experience. I highly recommend this place if you want great food!! And I hear if you are a big beer drinker, its even better, there is even a beer specialist on site (sort of like a wine connoisseur but for beer!!!)  And I haven't even mentioned the best part - After the groupon, which was $25 for $50 worth of food, the bill came out to $15!!! So it was basically $40 plus tip for dinner for 2 on the strip in a great restaurant. How awesome is that?!!"

Firstly, we were excited to learn that our waiter Arnie, who we were lucky to meet last year, was still there. Arnie is incredibly accommodating and offers kind attention to your needs as a diner. I suffer from food allergies, and I needed an alternative for bread. I asked for sliced cucumber... Where other waiters have said no. Arnie said, let me see what I can do.  Minutes later, I had sliced cucumber to have with my p\u00e2t\u00e9 and Bone marrow.  Speaking of bone marrow, you've got to try them here!!  We will be back to the Public house. For the bone marrow, for the bee knees cocktail (delicious ) and for the spectacular service from Arnie !"

            "review": "Based on the other reviews my wife and I decided to try Public House for dinner this past weekend.  While the quality of the food was okay, the service warrants this low rating.  I would probably give the food 3-3.5 stars.  The poutine was okay, the \"Belgian\" beer flight overpriced and mediocre at best (and our server was unable to recall the styles of the four beers on the paddle), my burger was overcooked but my wife liked her salmon.\n\nThe issue with our night started with the third person in our party, our friend had order a medium rare filet.  Immediately upon cutting into it, it was clear it wasn't mid rare, definitely closer to well or mid well.  The waiter apologized, took the steak back and informed us that he would bring her out a new steak as quickly as possible.  Five minutes later he came back, not with the new steak, but to inform us that the manager wanted to speak with us.  Another five minutes later and the manager comes to our table to tell us that a new steak will be out for her (but no apology or offer to comp).  By now ten minutes have passed, my wife and I are waiting for our friend's meal to arrive so we can start to eat ours.  Another twenty minutes pass and a medium rare filet is finally brought out to the table.  It really shouldn't take 30 minutes to prepare a medium rare filet.  What compounded the issue is the lack of service during that time and the weak offer of a dessert to compensate for the loss of time (I can't fault them for our decision to not start eating our entrees until our friend had her's.)  When we declined the dessert, the waiter offered to comp the poutine.\n\nWhen we received the bill, nothing was discounted.  We had been charged for the poutine and there was no discount on the bill.  Ultimately we asked to speak with the manager directly about the issue, and the filet was comped.\n\nI'm not in Vegas often enough to overlook poor service.  With the quantity of choices available, I don't see a reason to ever waste my time at this establishment again."

We loved the inventive takes on classic cocktails, and the true gastropub cuisine: hands down the best short rib I've ever had. Contrary to other reviews we've read we felt the portion sizes were ideal, allowing you to enjoy an appetizer, entree + side, and dessert that filled to perfection. \n\nThank you again to Tom, Hector, and everyone at Public House!

I was JUST there for dinner and it was so good I had to come home and write a review right away to share how good this place is.\n\nWe had a Groupon for here and before actually buying it, I was fervently going through the menu to make sure it was money well spent. Yep, definitely was. Just looking at the menu, I wished I could use more of the Groupons at once because everything on their menu sounded so good! \n\nAll of the waiters looked like gentlemens with their blazers and ties. It was a nice touch and it goes well with the decor. It's an intimate setting and the music wasn't too loud. Our waiter was very knowledgeable with the beers and helpful when we were choosing a beer. The bf had the Ommegang Witte which was light and had a very nice citrus aftertaste. I had the Funny Man and I really liked it. But for $12, I felt it could have been a bit stronger.\n\nAs for food, wee decided to get the poutine, bone marrow, and jamon serrano to start with. You have no idea how excited we were for the poutine. As soon as we saw the waiter walking towards us, our forks were in hand. When the plate landed on the table, it was every man for himself. It was GOOD. Although after eating half of it, it did get a tad salty, but that plate was licked clean. Then the bone marrow. That had to be the star of the night. The bread was perfectly grilled and that bacon marmalade gave each bite of bone marrow and beautiful sweetness. The bone marrow was easy to scoop out of the bones and super delicious. It was very oily though and once you take a bite, if you had chapped lips coming in, you won't have them once you're done. The jamon serrano was good but isn't much to write about.\n\nWe shared the scallops as an entree too and the scallops were cooked very well and the oxtail stew underneath it had a nice red wine flavor that wasn't overpowering. The matchstick potatoes also added a much needed crunch to eat bite.\n\nAt the end, the mustachioed man came over and settled our tab with the Groupon and I can see why he's known for his mustache. Pretty wicked. Definitely a friendly guy and he seemed to be visiting many tables throughout the night.\n\nOne weird thing for me was that there weren't any toilet seat covers in the bathroom. Not that they ran out, but there's no dispenser in the first place. May not bother most people, but I guess I'm a bit of a germaphob. \n\nAll in all, great place for food and drinks. A bit pricey but well worth the money!"

I was able to speak with him briefly during our lunch, and he promised us things of glory in the near future such as local Joseph James and Big Dogs specialty brews in casks... My eyes lit up with wonder.  \n\nI tried the Poutine ($8), which translates to \"heart attack\" in the native Canadian tongue.  French fries, duck, cheese curds, and a light gravy sauce.  The server warned me that the dish does not have added salt, but it is still extremely salty due to the ingredients.  Salty + beer = good, so I went with it.   Although salty, it wasn't offensively salty until I got to the very bottom of the bowl.  But by that time I was stuffed anyway.  It went perfectly with my beer, and let's be honest here, it is all about the beer.\n\nI had a beer blended by the house Cicerone (Russell Gardner), which was a Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza blended with Maui's Big Swell IPA.  Both beers are two of my favorite beers by themselves.  The Calabaza is a light, tart \"sour\" farmhouse ale.  It's flavor can make you pucker depending on how old it is (the older the more tart).  The Big Swell is a very citrusy, lightly bitter and refreshing IPA.  I knew the two would be great together, and I was right.  What a delight!  Russell hits a home run on his beer blendings.  \n\nThey had many amazing beers, such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter on cask, and Uinta's humongous (12% abv) and delicious imperial stout, Labyrinth on tap (good for dessert).  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that I had a small bite of my friend's tuna salad sandwich, and my other friend's hamburger (the $20 one).  Both were outstanding, although the tuna salad seemed like it could have been canned tuna to me.  \n\nOverall, this place is a gold mine for beer lovers.  Russell even offered to sell me some stuff in their cellar.  Nothing he had interested me at the time, but I will be back to see if he can score some beer for me.  Yay for Public House!"

Our server was knowledgeable and made a couple of great recommendations, one being a beer for my husband, and the other being my dinner...I am one of those weird people who prefer their steak to be well-done. He recommended that I instead get their shortribs, as they are cooked to well done, but are much more tender than a steak would be. I am so glad he recommended them. They were absolutely amazing, and in a very tasty sweet/sticky, almost teriyaki-like sauce (but better). I am not big on butternut squash, so they substituted fries for me. My husband got some sort of seafood platter that was meant to be an appetizer for a group of people, but he instead got it as a dinner for himself. He really enjoyed everything on it. The shrimp were some of the biggest we had ever seen.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone.

It was a curried carrot soup made with coconut milk and oh my goodness was it tasty. Very, very difficult not to lick the bowl on that one. Desserts sounded great but we ended up passing.

The server knew the beer selection better than the ipad they gave us that had the beer and wine menu loaded on it.

Both were outstanding.\n\nWe skipped the salads because the dessert menu looked too good to pass up.\n\nOur two dinner entree's were again outstanding.  The wife ordered the Short Rib (\"descHutes black butte porter\" braised, carrot mousseline, Heirloom carrots, ipa battered onion ring ) and I had a taste for steak so I ordered the Dry Aged Rib-eye (bone in) and it was one of the best steaks that ever slid past my tongue.  I added the onion/bacon marmalade and ordered a side of Forest Mushrooms adding more goodness to an already perfect meal.\n\nDessert did not disappoint.  The Creme Brulee (Pear Butter, Feuilletine Crumble, Milk Chocolate Sorbet) I ordered was perfect and the wife's Croissant Bread Pudding (Bananas Foster Sauce, Toasted Cinnamon Ice Cream) just sealed the deal as one of the best meals we have shared in our 26+ years together.\n\nI know it is difficult to choose a place to eat on the strip but if you are looking for a gastro pub with a very inventive menu this is the place.\n\nTHANKS FOR A WONDERFUL MEAL PUBLIC HOUSE!"

Great selection, but the price gauging had just begun. Add insult to injury, and yelp offered a free beer on check in. Talk about a bait and switch!  When you try to redeem it with a meal they tell you that it for a miller. WTF?  They couldn't tell you then on the yelp offer?  It wouldn't have changed my mind on going, but it was deceptive. \n\nHad poutine fries. Pretty good, but pricey at 13 bucks. \n\nHad pub burger which was at best, average, but at $19 ridiculous. Wife had the lobster mac and cheese. Again, just at or below average in quality. \n\nPlace was empty and perhaps this portends things to come here."

Public House was open (when most didn't open until 5) and in we went!\n\nThe decor was inviting with a long classy bar  front and center leading the way.  Grabbed a table towards the back .. Aahh.\n\nThe menu had some pretty unique offerings.. From salads to Caviar to lamb ++.  I order charred octopus (it was ok, but wouldn't order again) and popped a few stolen scrumptious Brussels sprouts from my table mates.\n\nOur server was a soup nazi.. Cranky, slow and definitely not happy to be there. My table mates were able to have a side salad with their meal.. However  It  was strictly forbidden for me to order a side salad period - \"NO SALAD FOR YOU\" (nor explanation, exception, nada).. That set the tone for the remainder of our experience .. Sad given the place was pretty empty with exception of a handful bellied up to the bar in the other room.\n\nWhat I thought was fantastic.. And this may be a first - were the restrooms.... Pretty clever and proved to be more memorable then the staff and meal. \n\nVegas is a food Mecca and there are way too many other joints to partake in vs what we experienced at Public House. (Unless you're just looking for a place to take a memorable leak )"

I had a great time dining here, thought the food was decent (going down) and I immensely enjoyed the beer selection. But it's all out the window after a bought of violent body purging illness, so sad really. \n\nI've narrowed down which food item caused the involuntary evacuation, and I know for sure it was the scotch egg. When I saw it on the menu, I was dazzled, having just seen a special on the food network about scotch eggs, I had to try it, and oh the regret ... Side note, a scotch egg sounds much better than it actually tastes. Skip it.\n\nI tried the sour beer, their house lager, and the cask beer (which is just a fancy way to serve flat beer) all excellent. \n\nThe short rib was ok, but it tasted a lot like Mom's crock pot. The lobster creamed corn was off the chain!!!!!! My husband's quail and waffles were fabulous too. Just wish we had kept it down in our bellies instead of ... well ... use your imagination."

I would highly suggest trying one of their beer flights as a way to sample some amazing and unique beer.\n\nThe service was great, the music was great, the atmosphere was great, the outfits were great, and the beer selection and quality was the best I've seen.

He also tried getting me to add avocado or bacon. Just beware of that. Also, we had a Yelp coupon for a free draft. This does NOT mean whatever beer you order will be free.

We were planning on grabbing a bite to eat for a late breakfast but it was early enough to where most places were still closed so we just dropped in real quick to get things moving. The bar was above standard but literally all we needed was a good beer and, yes, they delivered. The bartenders, Chris and Brad (I hope I'm right when acknowledging them here) were spectacular. The guys offered excellent service, provided a solid beer selection from a small description of our favorite tastes, and offered fantastic conversation and a few places to check out during our lengthy stay in Vegas. While this review is also to let you all know how awesome this place is to at least stop in (food looked excellent as well but we were too into the moment) the main point of my review is to give credit to the amazing customer experience we had here. These guys deserve that and more for what they do for this establishment."

I just got back from Vegas tonight and stopped by the Public House (based on the reviews here) two days ago. Honestly, it is a bar. That's it. I got the burger which was good but nothing that the Yard House or Portillo's couldn't deliver on. \n\nThe beer selection was diverse but not ton of it on draft. Also, I noticed that each person walking in the door received different options for trying the beer. For example, one couple was offered their \"around the world\" beer tasting when they walked in, I wasn't offered much of anything but the menu, and another group was given other recommendations. Very odd and bad way to introduce the beer -- they need to be consistent to all their customers. Regardless, I tried three different beers in bottles (again, because they didn't have much on draft) and wasn't really impressed.\n\nI definitely won't be going back, not with so many options in Vegas. I heard of another Irish Pub at New York New York that I'll hit up next time. I don't really recommend this place unless you're just looking for something simple and not memorable."

Our server looks like a 21 year old with no experience. He had 4 tables to wait, one of which was empty yet somehow he was never around. He forgot our drinks menu until 10 minutes in (at a gastropub...seriously?), also forgot to get us extra utensils and condiments when asked repeatedly. At this point my party was getting pretty pissed off. Thinking he was a kid, I wasn't going to stiff him on tips but was socked to see there was an 18% gratuity added for our party of 4. guess he must have anticipated our irritation and preemptively struck. that was gutsy.

It wasn't dry which made up for the fact that it was over cooked but disappointed that they couldn't get it right. The thing that makes this review 3 stars instead of four was the service.

            "review": "Good food, weird service, and spendy prices make for a 3 star experience. \n\nFirst of all, if your restaurant is completely empty and I walk up the host station saying, \"Two for lunch please,\" an appropriate response is not \"Do you have a reservation?\" Even less appropriate is to ask for my first name, last name and cell phone number. I ain't falling for your text message marketing scheme, Public House. Also pretty sure that I won't \"forget anything at the table\" like you suggest that's what giving you my number is for. Sheesh.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's get to the food. I had to go to work immediately after, and the server did not disappoint when I told him I had to be out of there in an hour. He got us our food and my friend's beers and even time to glance at a dessert menu in that time. Well done, sir. \n\nMy friend ordered a beer flight--I rode with a lemonade because I hear that workplaces nowadays don't like when you show up just having drunk at the pub. So I hear. Anyway, we both ordered the pub burger and shared the welsh rarebit and the crisp pork belly. \n\nBurger--outstanding. I'm not sure worth the $19 pricetag, but definitely delicious. I would order this again if I were inclined to revisit. Welsh rarebit--delicious and reasonable at I believe $7. I would also order this again. The allegedly crisp pork belly was not that great--it wasn't crisp at all, and not really a good sharing appetizer. I love pork belly but this didn't have the best punch-you-in-the-mouth melty bacon flavor. Pass.\n\nAll in all a decent meal, but if you get an appetizer, a side, two burgers, a beer flight and a beer, it will run you over $100. Steep pricing, but I suppose that's what you get with a schmancy hotel like Venetian/Palazzo."

With such a large selection, they have sampler selections that would allow you to try different beers without getting too blitzed.\n\nFrom the \"Butcher Block\" tried the Jamon Serrano and the Rabbit Loin in Porcetta.  Serrano ham was good, not too salty.  The Rabbit/Porcetta was flavorful and moist.\nTried three cheeses from the \"Cheese Shop\"  Don't remember all but do remember the Roquefort Blue.  Mild for a blue cheese which is a good thing.  Accompanied the two dishes were toast points, jam, and grain mustard.\n\nThe short ribs were dry, crispy frog legs were good, poutine was the best of the three.  What's not good about fries covered in gravy, cheese curds, and duck confit.\n\nOverall the experience was worthwhile and would not mind revisiting this establishment."

I had been running around all day and was on my own for lunch so I got the call from a fellow colleague to meet them for lunch at Public House. \n\nWalked in and the ambiance is pretty cool. The bar is on the left right when you walk in, which is right where I found my fellow colleagues with a glass of Pino waiting for me (such good friends). The bartender was really friendly as well. It was pretty packed around noon and there's a lot of space when you walk in so plenty of room to wait for your party to arrive.\n\nOnce we were seated we were provided water and got a few drinks. We started with the steak tartar which was really good. It came with sliced toasted bread which no one really used because the bread seemed unnecessarily big for the actual tartar. I got the kale salad which was really good. I think it has apples ans candied walnuts with shaved fennel. Others ordered the chicken wings, Caesar salad and the special which was the Reuben sandwich. Everyone seemed pretty content with their orders.\n\nOverall the ambiance waa really nice. Kinda rustic and dark inside, like you're in an upscale barn lol but I liked it. I saw a lot of people eating/having drinks here through out the week so it looks like people are enjoying themselves as well. I'd definitely come back if I stay at the Palazzo again."

The allure of this place for me was all the drinks that you could choose from, like a cold cider to cut the fat from the POUTINE FRIES (which are addicting)! I treated the menu like it was tapas style. I could eat a dozen bacon wrapped dates, perfect sized sweet and salty morsels. I also opted for the quail on a bed of swiss chard and bacon and waffles, a spin on chicken on waffles. I needed a little more meat on the bones to make up for all the gluttony. Overall, I enjoyed my meal but would  say pick at least one dish that's protein packed to accomodate for the richness of most of the dishes on the menu. A great spot for dates, drinks, and bigger groups (lots of booths)."

However, combined with the great service, entree, and a particular appetizer (GET IT).  This is a place that you can come to relax just before a long night in LV.\n\nThe appetizer that won my heart was their pig's tail.  Wow.  It was tender, soft, full of flavor, and crispy and sweet on the outside.  Simply the best pig part that I've tasted from a Western style cooking perspective.  So... I say again, GET IT!\n\nThe other dishes were decent... though I was underwhelmed by the poutine.  I'd skip that one.  The roasted bone marrow.... excellent.  It had good texture and was freshly cooked.  The short rib was tender and soft.  The sea bass was good, but personally, it was a little buttery for me.  If you are into very buttery dishes though, then this is the dish to get.\n\nThe desserts were really good.  I had chocolate stout cake and the croissant bread pudding.  They were both sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nThe presentation and service were both excellent as well.  This restaurant touts itself as casual... but I think it's a nice place where you can take your girl/guy on a date.\n\nAnyway... give it a try!  Remember, get the pig's tail!"

We had a bit of a wait. The place was quite crowded for a Tuesday evening. We were finally seated and greeted warmly by our server. \n\nWe perused the drink menu for quite some time before deciding on our drinks for the evening. This is no easy feat with the enormous beer, wine and mixed drink selection options they have. I ordered The Blonde and my fella decided on the Banana Bread beer. The drinks came out and everyone kept raving about the Banana Bread beer being their favorite. I wanted nothing to do with it since I don't like the smell or banana, but my fella was quite excited. He tasted it and by the look on his face, he was no as impressed as everyone else seemed to be. My drink, on the other hand, was amazing. My fella even admitted that mine was far superior to his. Haha. I eventually did try the Banana Bread beer out of curiosity and although it wasn't my favorite beer ever, but it wasn't bad. \n\nFor food we shared a few small plates. We got the bone marrow, bacon wrapped figs and the grilled octopus. I have to admit the items we ordered didn't blow me away, but I see potential on the food front. The octopus was a little fishier than I'm used to and I guess I was hoping for a chewier texture. It was just a little different than the octopus I'm used to. The bacon wrapped figs weren't a favorite of mine either. The dressing was just overwhelmingly sweet and I wished that the bacon was just a little crispier to add a less mushy texture to the whole dish. The bone marrow was probably my favorite. It was fatty and fuil of flavor. I was definitely impressed with the restaurant overall and look forward to going back and trying a number of other beers that they offer. I'm also interested by quite a few more options on the food menu that I think hold potential. \n\nThe best part of our dining experience was the service. It was the deciding factor between giving this place a 3 and a 4. Our waiter and busboy were incredibly attentive and every server who brought a drink or plate to our table made pleasant conversation and had a great attitude. To top it all off we had a great conversation with the restaurant manager / sommelier.. He was extremely gracious. We will definitely be back... and soon."

It was easily a five star dish. I wanted to try the bone marrow as well but I couldn't find time to come back during my trip. The restaurant can get a little noisy and uncomfortable but for the most part it had a decently nice atmosphere.\n\nLike most other Vegas restaurants the prices for the food provided is a little over the top, but in this case the ratio of quality vs price wasn't too bad.\n\nI would go back."

The dark wood paneling bring to mind an old school Irish pub.\n\nThe beer and wine list is presented on an electronic tablet, and the draft list is fun. The list is west coast centric, with nods towards Ballast Point, Modern Times, and Green Flash. There were even a few Las Vegas local beers.\n\nWe went at lunch; if we randomly picked three items, the average check per person with alcohol would be 40+. Would be worth it if the food were spectacular, but it wasn't. \n\nPrime rib dip was made with reheat meat. Lobster roll sandwich had shells in it. Coleslaw made with Brussels sprouts had brown stems left on. \n\nFaux pas- beer ordered cost more on the final tab than the Tablet menstated.\n\nThis is a decent enough bar, just avoid the buyers remorse of their mediocre, overpriced food."

The service was outstanding, they really were all over everything. I added some photos of our meal, the Manhattan cocktail was quite good as well.  I would recommend sitting in the lounge area and facing the front door so that you can continue your people watching throughout your meal. Some guys next of us got the beer flight tasting and that looked quite good as well.  Be sure to look up and you can follow the pipes that carry all the different beers on tap from the keg room to the bar. Pretty nice job of decorating this place."

Now were talking!\n\nAnd the food.  This isn't your usual fish and chips, sliders, and nachos.  This is pub fare at it's finest.  The bone marrow served with a bacon marmalade and coarse sea salt is so rich, unctuous, and just plain good eats once spread on some grilled bread.  The four inch long bones does a great job preventing the marrow from overcooking. Perfect.\n\nOther must try plates include the grilled octopus, potted duck rillettes, veal sweetbreads with a refreshing green apple slaw, and the blow your mind great poutine (thin fries topped with duck confit and a cheese curd sauce).  Finally, the lump crab salad that is more crab than greens accompanied by a tempura avocado and supreme of grape fruit.  Well balanced and delicious.\n\nNote:  the dishes are made to be paired with beer or wine.  They taste salty if eaten alone.\n\nPrices are in line with other true gastropubs.  Beers average $10. Wines below typical Vegas resorts.  \n\nService is excellent.  Bartenders and servers are extremely knowledgeable.  Amazing considering how quickly the selection of brews change.\n\nHighly recommended for a good time!"

Right in front of the \"Wine Shelter\"! I just wanted to drink juice...pineapple juice. So, I looked at their drink menu from a tablet.  Alcohol, alcohol and more alcohol. Then I saw \"pineapple juice\" so that's what I got. It was beer brewed with pineapple juice and it was the tastiest beer (Mana Wheat)  I've had this year.\n\nThey had lots of good items on the menu but what I wanted to put to the test were the poutine and porchetta sandwich since I haven't found good versions of these dishes here in Vegas. We got poutine (appetizer portion), lobster roll, chicken sandwich and a porchetta sandwich. You can get your sandwich with fries or onion rings or poutine. \n\nPoutine:\nJust like the good ol' Canadian way of making it: fries, cheese curds and gravy - but this had duck confit which made an already delicious dish even better. The fries were hot and slightly crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The cheese curds are melted somewhere in between those hot fries. The gravy was tasty. The duck confit was tender and perfect on the poutine. This has got to be the best poutine I've had - yup, even better than the ones I've had in Canada. Insane! 5/5\n\nLobster Roll:\nHerbed coleslaw, lobster, butter lettuce on toasted brioche. I've had really good lobster rolls from New England and even here in Vegas - varying price tags too. I've also had awful lobster rolls. This was meaty. However, it has that watery mayo sauce that I'm not too fond of. It's still good but not my favorite. 3.5/5\n\nPorchetta Sandwich:\nPork belly, salsa rossa, garlic aioli and arugula on a baguette. Porchetta is one of those things that makes me feel glad my beliefs don't prevent me from eating pork...if it's done right. This was really fatty and oily...and really delicious. The garlic aioli makes me less guilty for eating porchetta since garlic lowers your blood pressure. 5/5\n\nThe service was on point. Glasses were kept filled. The server was friendly, attentive but not annoying and was able to make good recommendations. This is a perfect place to nurse a hangover or to get a hangover!"

Everyone also liked the duck confetti fries called \"poutine\", pub burger and ahi poke. \n\nBut what everyone kept raving about and the beer! I even tasted a few of them and it tasted really good and I don't even like beer. I had this peachy cocktail which was more on the sweeter side that our waiter recommended to me and that was really yummy.

The cool bartender gave me a taster of another beer with a bolder flavor he felt would work better with the burger.\n\nThe burger ?  Perfectly cooked but needed a little more salt.

Most places that serve roasted bone marrow have issues with the marrow being skimpy or stuck to the bone so you can't get it all.  Public House blanches it first so you get all of it, and it's juicy and generous.  Plus, bacon marmalade.  Sounds gross, I know, but trust me.  It works perfectly with this dish.\n\nThe Welsh Rarebit is also a requirement.  This is basically cheese toast, but done with such awesome cheeses and herbs that it's a delicious, savory pub appetizer.  Four generous slices.\n\nThe lunch sandwiches are a great deal, and the Prime Rib French Dip is fabulous.  Meaty, tender, and awesome in every way.  I was sober when I had mine, but it would be perfect hangover food.  The jus provided is actual beef juice and not bullion cubes in water.\n\nI highly recommend the $2 onion rings upgrade.  They are battered onion rings and they are crisp and hot, not at all soggy like some places.\n\nOn another night there I had the Alaskan Halibut dinner entree.  It is not a huge amount of food, but still an excellent portion for $30, and served on top of a small bed of risotto that is delicious.  The halibut is tender and moist, with just the right amount of crisp on top.  Very flavorful.  I will definitely come here again."

And while that statement has so many salacious and insidious connotations here, for our group it meant hitting up one of the places I was most looking forward to for this trip to Sin City. I actually first heard of Public House when I was trying to find anywhere in Vegas that served a good variety of craft/specialty beers, and then subsequently read heavily lauded reviews from Ashley H and Venu N, which only cemented the fact that it would be a must upon arrival.\n\nIt's tucked way back in the recesses of The Venetian, and may take a bit of exploring to find, especially since it's one of the more \"normal\" looking restaurants you'll spot in a Vegas casino, from the outside. Inside though, the place definitely has a unique charm. As mentioned by Venu, the bathroom humor here is some of the best I've ever seen. Unfortunately for me my digital camera memory card died about a week after my Vegas trip ended, completely wiping all the photos I had taken (and idiotically not yet transferred to my laptop), so you'll only be privy (no pun intended) to the one gem I recall reading, just above the men's urinal: \"Stand a little closer, it's smaller than you think.\"\n\nVidal, Julie, Zack, and I all set down and started drinking as soon as we had gone through the 100 or so beers on the very nifty iPad like tablet they use here, while we waited on Brian to arrive and join us. Unfortunately I had lured everyone here with the promise of beautiful women, and while there were a few cute hostesses, our waiter turned out to more closely resemble Humpty Dumpty (which, ironically, was a fascination of former restaurateur David Burke, who used to occupy this space), and their cicerone (akin to a sommelier, for beer) someone who had retired from his former life as a circus ring master. Both were quite nice, indeed, but my mates hopes were far from fulfilled. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment of the night came when, on multiple occasions, their cicerone poured our beers much like someone on their first shift at an average sports bar would, causing head to flow over all down the glass and on the table. This is something I expect from Uncle Buck, not someone with a professional certification in beer service. As for the list itself, it's pretty good, with about 100 bottles to choose from, all pretty fairly priced (I went with the Trappistes \"Rochefort 10\" at $16 and the Firestone Walker \"Wookey Jack\" Black Rye IPA at $25 for a 22oz) and nicely arranged by style. I was hoping to see a few more really rare finds, similar to the elite class of beer bars, but that was mostly missing here. There is high quality stuff to be sure, but most of it can be found at any of the mid-tier beer bars around the country. Compared to the virtual (and literal) desert that is the Vegas beer bar scene though, this is at the mountain top by a mile.\n\nThe food turned out to be quite good as well, although I think we would have been wiser to follow some of the previous diners' examples and stick with multiple shared medium plates rather than the entr\u00e9e dishes. My beer braised short rib and IPA battered onion rings were great, and the sweet pea puree was certainly novel, if not distracting, but I don't think the pork loin, pub burger, or pappardelle quite pleased my friends as much, and after a few bites of each I concurred that while they were solid, they weren't up to the same level. The Welsh rarebit was a massive disappointment that I do not recommend, and the poutine was great (to me), although my friends found it extremely salty, and technically I think it's more like disco fries with duck confit on top, rather than actual poutine. Either way I agree with all the other recommendations to absolutely order this dish (just know it's an ass kicker)."

We got a round of Ballast Point's reliably delicious Sculpin from the taps, then ordered a few bottles. We tried the overpriced but tasty Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA (it was $26 for a not that big bottle) and Green Flash's Le Freak (a mutant combination of a Belgian Trippel and an American IPA), both delicious. I wasn't hungry because I'd eaten on the road, but my friend ordered their Burger and Fries and I tried a few bites... good stuff.\n\nThe decor was fun, basically a hip and winky American vibe with Vinyl Lincoln, Franklin, and GW Bush dolls lining the walls and a huge glass encased beer room. Our waitress was nice, but proportioned in those ridiculous Las Vegas waitress ways. So basically this place combined a hipster beer-hall you'd find in Brooklyn or Silver Lake and infused it with some singularly Vegas flourishes, which made it both silly and awesome. Definitely a great place to check out if you like good beer when you're in Las Vegas."

After we sat down, we were informed that it was their opening night. This immediately made me a little wary, as I don't usually frequent restaurants until they've stretched their sea legs a bit. We had briefly glanced at the menu before entering, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the lamb-filled pierogies. As someone of Greek and Polish descent, this was like music to my soul... er... stomach. As I said, it was their opening night and management was palpably nervous, overeager, and ready to please. Our waiter must have come over three or four times to check if everything was OK, and the owner of the restaurant came over for a good-sized chat right after we ordered and again for a moment as we were eating. Strangely, the waiters made laps around the restaurant, quite unnecessarily, it appeared. For example, my husband finished his wine and the waiter picked up his empty wine glass, walked around the restaurant a few times, and then carried it into the kitchen. I watched several full, untouched plates of food go in and out of the kitchen... for inspections, perhaps? I am not well-versed in culinary protocol, but this just looked flat out odd. The busboys wear navy blue polo shirts, and for the price of this restaurant, we felt as if they should be dressed a little more formally. The waiters wear shirts, ties, and jackets, but (and this was REALLY weird) the girls flounce around in white t-shirts, plaid boxer shorts, and knee highs...?!?  It was like Scottish lassies meets well-dressed gentlemen, with a very french d\u00e9cor and style of thatched wine racks everywhere and flat panel TVs. Nothing \"matched.\" \n\nMy husband's hanger steak was excellent, and the pierogies were absolutely out of this world. The mashed potatoes are on the plate, with the pierogies stuffed only with lamb and resting atop the potatoes. Lamb au jus is pooled around the entire plate. YUM!!!  For dessert, we tried the chocolate cake and the sticky toffee pudding, both excellent. The chocolate cake had clusters of Rice Crispies and bacon. I am drooling just thinking about the food. For the food, 10 stars out of five. For service and d\u00e9cor, 2 stars. The music was entirely too loud to have any decent conversation with your company. The waiter accidentally charged us for an entire bottle of Qube, but we only had one glass. Etiquette would usually dictate that the entire glass is removed from the check due to the error, but he simply fixed it and said, \"OK, now you've just been charged for the one glass.\" If he had removed the charge entirely, we would have tipped on the price of the one glass of wine in addition to the food, but because he didn't, we left a 10% tip. I think once everyone chills out a bit, this place will be incredible, but they need to work on service before I'd return again."

The beer list is still the best I've seen anywhere, but I feel the last couple of meals here have been just so-so.\n\nThe food's decent overall, just not as good as I felt it had been. For example, a couple of hot appetizers have come out with cold spots. I told our waiter and he tried to explain it as the kitchen maybe being out of practice with this particular item because they don't sell many of them. Sounds more like a lack of quality control in the kitchen to me.\n\nAs a bar, 5 stars. Literally can't do better if you're on the Las Vegas strip and want a quality craft beer.\n\nAs a restaurant, 3 stars. With so many great restaurants on the strip, you can do better IMHO."

I checked the menu online and thought it was worth a try.\n\nI was NOT disappointed!  We ordered the Bone Marrow appetizer which was still sizzling when it was brought to our table.  The bacon marmalade and grilled bread that accompanied it were both yummy.\n\nMy husband ordered the pub burger.  It was huge and looked juicy.  He said it was very good, but I did not get to try it because I was too busy swooning over the Scallops that I ordered for myself.  3 jumbo scallops seared to perfection atop shredded oxtail stew with a touch of matchstick potatos on top of it.  My only complaint about the scallops is that the portion was small.\n\nI loved the decor, the staff was friendly without being too intrusive.  The signs in the hallway leading to the bathroom and in the actual bathroom stalls were quirky and cute.  \n\nThe only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because at the end of the meal, it took them awhile to not only get our check to us, but to pick up our payment and then return it back to us.  I usually don't complain about this if it's busy, but there were not that many people dining at this time.\n\nKudos to Chef Anthony Meidenbauer!"

Having previously gotten lost looking for Bouchon at the Venetian, I was a little concerned that finding Public House would be difficult but it was pretty easy to find. I made reservations on Open Table but it wasn't really necessary for the time of year. We were the only ones dining. \n\nThe main reason I wanted to try Public House was for the duck Poutine. For those of you who don't know what Poutine is, it's fries with gravy and cheese curds on it. Public House puts duck confit on them as well. OMG it lived up to expectations. So delicious! Portion size was pretty generous for the two of us. We couldn't finish it. I could definitely have just eaten the Poutine as my entree. We also split a French dip sandwich which was excellent. There was so much meat in the sandwich I could barely bite it. Poutine alone makes it worth a return trip."

They have an extensive bottle list but the prices are stadium level high; $14 for a Dog Fish Palo Santo Marron and $8 for Negro Modelo?? come on! But prices weren't the only thing that knocked down my review....\n\nThe service... my god... so we had a table for 5 and 3 of us were good to go at the reservation time, I figured that would be enough to get seated. But no... their policy was we needed to have the entire group. This was on a Friday but there were plenty of tables available and they close at 12 so I don't see why this rule isn't flexible. We just wanted to get some appetizers and give you our money! Since two of us were running an hour late, we decided to head back to the Venetian and gamble. Luckily it wasn't a total bust as I won $134 on the monopoly machine. \n\nWe went back at ~10:30 (might've been 11) with our 5 and... yeah they weren't seating people anymore. So we had to seat in their lounge area. We grabbed a seat from another table (again PLENTY of tables available) and figured we could get a few drinks in before closing time. The first round was quick and on point. Second round not so much... two drinks took well over half an hour to arrive, small apology is all we got, and another was brought without a clean glass. The place was pretty dead so I have no idea why it took so long to get our drinks. But the beer was good and we were no our way. Until we saw the terrible bill.\n\nWe were double charged for the two drinks that took +30mins to arrive. We had asked for a split check and they weren't even close to be correct. Took us a few minutes to flag her down but she did manage to write down which drinks should be billed to which check. Though she did fight us on the double charges. She kept pointing to my beer and saying I had two of the $14 beers... yeah I would've remember that. She also said \"well the bar made two margaritas\" and we countered with \"well we only ordered one and only one showed up\". Took a few more run through and she was annoyed by it but she did fix it so I tipped her the difference.\n\nWish I had the chance to try out the food but with the lousy service maybe it was for the best. I'll go back with a fellow beer lover but the price and service aren't worth for the casual group gatherings."

We preferred their menu over Bouchon so decided it give it a try. I loved the food selection, the service was great, food itself was delicious. Started with the steak tartar with poached egg. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the poached egg took it to another level. My only criticism would be the bread that was served with the tartar. It was big and bulky. Too much bread to eat with such a delicate tasting dish. Also had the caesar and beet salads. Our mains were the short rib and Scottish salmon. Salmon skin was crispy and the salmon was moist. The short rib was so tender. Would definitely recommend and come back to this place. Glad we chose it over Bouchon."

A good place to hang out with friends and drink before a wild night out. \n\nWhen we got the menu, the one thing that pleasantly surprised me was the how decently priced everything was.

Very good food.  The BF ordered the pub burger which he really enjoyed. My favorite in the restaurant was definitely the mussels and clams. SOOO delicious! The broth had a good flavor that by the time I was finished with all the seafood I was dipping anything that I could find in it.

Our waiter was pleasant and informative.   \n\nFood & Drinks - this is where things start going downhill.  The spirits menu is presented in digital form.  That's pretty cool.  I flipped to the Reserve Beer section and spied a Brooklyn Black OPS!  Always wanted to try one so placed the order.  Waiter comes back to the table and says sorry, that one sold out within 10 days of being on the menu.  I'm disappointed, but quickly get over it when I see they also have Firestone Walker Parabola!  One of my favorites - so placed that order next.  Waiter slinks back to the table telling me that it is sold out as well.  Oh well, they still had some other limited bottles and I settled on a FW Sucaba.  So not a total failure, just wish they would keep their menu up to date.   \n\nNext, I asked our waiter if the Onion Rings were hand battered and were told that they were.  I ordered the Pub Burger and onion rings.  When the food arrived, I had soggy french fries, but no onion rings.  The server put the dishes down and ran off before I even had a chance to call out the mistake.  Finally flagged down a server and told them about the onion rings.  When then finally came out, they were hot, but weren't anything special.  Also, the Pub burger was a little above average, but was not as good as the one I had over at Buddy V's.  Finally, the water smelled and tasted horrible.  I don't know if they don't filter it or what, but never had a bad water experience at any other restaurant in The Venetian/Palazzo.  \n\nThis place had all the makings for a memorial visit, but they just failed to execute.  \n\nWon't be back for food, but would stop back for a beer - just won't get my hopes up."

The marrow acts as the \"butter\" for the bread slices while the carmelized onions gives it that much needed kick.  Tasty dish.\n\nShort rib:  While on the expensive side for short rib, it was probably the most tender short rib I've ever had.  I always expect short rib to be a bit on the dry side, but not here.  The pea mash potatoes are tasty... if you like peas.\n\nDry-aged rib eye:  Although I've had a better steak for the price, Public house does serve a decent piece of meat.  Although a bit on the fatty side, the meat was juicy, tender, and nicely seasoned.  We also ordered a side of herbed fries for 7bux.  It was nice and crispy.\n\nBeer menu: Nice selection of items on tap.  While they were out of a few items that I wanted (grrrrr),  they still had other items like Stone 15th anniversary, Big Bear IPA, moose drool, chimay triple white, and a few others.  The markup for the beers was a bit much though.  Expect to pay 8+ dollars per glass.  Cool concept to have an ipad as the drink menu.\n\n4 stars is about right for Public House.  Come here, pay a pretty penny, and enjoy some delicious good eats."

Unfortunately, there must have been cross-contamination going on in the kitchen, as my friend was horribly ill later - and I was just fine, and we had shared all our food.  Hopefully they can figure out a way to keep the gf food separate in future."

I had the wood aged one and was not disappointed.  All 4 were tasty and interested and I grabbed 2 other splendid drafts later on.  So the beer's great but my wife came too and I was worried she would not enjoy our dining as much as I did.  Not an issue.  The food was fantastic, even when compared to the previous days Gordon Ramsey Steak trip.  The bone marrow was cool and tasty especially with the bacon marmalade (that exists?).  The Caesar salad was very tasty and my wife is not always keen on Caesars.  We split the short ribs which were the best either of us had had.  It came with some carrot/milk pur\u00e9e that was like the plate good (we may have sort of done that).  Mushroom side were also great for me.  The stout chocolate layer cake with brown butter ice cream was really good.  4 thumbs up!"

This was delicious.  The bone marrow combined w/ the caramelized onions is like smack of flavor hitting your taste buds.  \n\nGrilled Octopus - $16 -  3.75/5 - potatoes, bell-pepper spices, and onions.  The octopus came out just right;  the texture was soft to bite into.  I was worried it'd be rubbery but that wasn't the case at all.  The octopus by itself is boring but if you combine it w/ the veggies, sauce, and the peppers it's almost like eating a fresh salad.  Very refreshing.\n\nGrilled Frog Legs - $17 - 4/5  - Seasoned w/ butter, lemon, and served w/ tomatoes, and crutons.  Acidity of the lemon is offset w/ the butter to have a perfect finish.  Delicious!  Use the crutons to soak up the delicious sauce!\n\nScotch Egg  $9 - 3.5/5- The mustard used w/ the Scotch Egg was out of this world delicious.  If they bottled this mustard I'd buy it in a heartbeat!  The egg was a little lacking but still delicious.\n\nMussels $14 - 4.5/5- My favorite appetizer. Mussels, in a cream w/ Belgium beer, served with bacon, comes w/ a side of bread - The sauce used w/ the mussels was amazing.  The bacon combined w/ the mussels was delicious.  Use the bread to soak up the amazing sauce!\n\nShort ribs - $29 - 4/5 - Braised short rib, green peas (in cream form), and 2 onion rings - The braised short rib was amazing.  So tender and flavorful.  You can cut this sucker w/ your fork!  The green peas were delicious too.  I'm not sure why the onion rings are here - I'd prefer something else to be honest.\n\nTIPS:\n+If you are ordering appetizers I'd highly recommend ordering a side of bread so you can dip your bread in all the delicious sauces"

On the 4th try we met bartenders, Lila & cool Hawaiian/Japanese guy (sorry I forgot your name).  Lila inquired why bf wasn't drinking, and when she discovered he wasn't feeling well, she made him a drink with bitters to help ease his tummy.  So thoughtful!\n\nIf any of the 3 above bartenders are working, I can personally vouch for their awesomeness.  However, I've been on days where it was a totally different crew who were oblivious.  To clarity my review, 5 stars go to Russell, Lila, and Hawaiian/Japanese guy bartender, and my other 2 visits are a 0 star."

I settled on a drink called \" The Kramer\"...it was deliciously strong with a mix of Phillips Union Vanilla (which I love straight), Chocolate Bitters, and Carpano Antica which I had no idea what it was but later found out it's a high end Italian Sweet Vermouth, so it was well worth the 12$. My husband got the Summer Dunkel which is Bourbon and Beer with a twist, I tasted it and it tasted like a Mary Jane or Squirrel Nut Zipper candy...yum! Friends tried some local beers since they are from way out of town (Scotland). \nI got some Devils on Horseback (blue cheese, bacon wrapped dates) to start, you only get 3 for 6$, they come with Melba toasts. they were good but I have had better. I also got the Scotch Egg (9$), it was amazing. The sausage was a little sweet and juicy, the egg was bright and fresh, all inside a nice crunchy outside. Not greasy at all, the Bacon Mustard dipping sauce was the perfect match. My husband got the Pub Burger (slathered in bacon marmalade and guiness aioli to name a few toppings), it was messy, flavorful, and cooked as ordered. Why can't all these burger joints around Vegas make a burger like this? The Herb Fries it comes with were crispy and scrumptious. Our friends got the Pork and Chicken sandwiches, they came with Herbed Fries too, the sandwiches looked good, the chicken sandwich was on a pretzel roll! They gobbled up their meals. The food was a little pricey, service was good, staff was pleasant. Nice atmosphere. The restaurant really filled up while we were there.\nI can't wait to go back and try some more of their food and drink. It all sounds so good!"

We learned about their cocktails and the staff themselves. We got to meet the head chef as well, and he outlined how they incorporate beer in to many of their food items. My husband is more of a beer drinker but loved their Vesper and definitely didn't leave as sober as he rolled in. I enjoyed their La Marca prosecco as it was sweet and cheapo at $9/glass.\n\nFor food, we split the french dip sandwich and it was plenty for the two of us. My husband liked the spice on the fries, which was a tad curry-ish.

Very calm and intimate. I love that. The crowd that comes here is a more mature crowd, so you won't hear any trendy club music or find discount shots.\nWe went here on New Years Eve, one of the Strips busiest nights and Public House was a needed escape from all the crowds and craziness. The menus at the bar are so freaking cool! They give you an electronic tablet that has their entire drink menu programmed on it. From cocktails to spirits to beer. EVERYTHING is there to learn about. You just touch your category and choose from a list. Once you have chosen something, for example a cocktail, it tells you what's in it. If you're not interested, just go back to the previous list.\n\nOur bartender was awesome. He was a real friendly knowledgeable guy. This was our one and only visit to Public House and it was well worth it. If we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will return for a night of drinking at Public House."

I don't know how the burger was because my husband ate it in about 1 bite, but he seemed to enjoy it!  The pork belly sandwich was just okay, there was way too much slaw and no apple aioli like promised.  The pork belly was also jut a bit off, like it was almost too chewy.  I know pork belly in general is very fatty and can be chewy but I kept feeling the need to look an make sure what I was eating was cooked!  We also had the poutine with an egg on top....very good!

Located at The Venetian Hotel and Casino right across from the Blue Man Group theater, the wife and I decided to try this  based off from all the good Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. I researched the menu before arriving so I knew what I wanted, but unfortunatly the menu I was handed only somewhat resembled the on-line version and many of my choices were missing. This was rather aggravating but all was forgiven after the meal as what I did have was excellent.  All the plates are designed for sharing which is nice as it allows you to try a little of everything. One of my favorite things was being able to design my own meat and cheese platters.  For the cheese choice we went with Welsh Cheddar, seriously sharp and seriously good and served with a Fresh sweet Tomato jam. For the meat choices we went with a thin sliced and delicious Serrano Ham with whole grain mustard and Potted Duck Rillettes ,which was basically a duck confit spread served in what looked like a candle jar. This was rich and creamy and paired well with the cheese, tomato jam mustard and Ham. All the items were served with some nice grilled crunchy French Bread.  Our next course was Duck Poutine ( because I can't get enough of duck or Fries with Cheese Curds and Gravy)  This would have been better had the fries been homemade as is traditional poutine but was still very good. The gravy was dark and rich and made with dark porter ale beer. The whole dish was greasy goodness.  Next up we split a short rib entree, complete with neon green sweet pea mashed potatoes, more stout gravy and a couple onion rings for garnish. The short rib was fall apart tender and extremely meaty and rich. This was far better then any other steak I had while  in Vegas ( sorry Mr. Gordon Ramsey). Lastly was dessert, which we didn't really need but were glad we got.  I can't actually remember the name but it was a deliciously moist chocolate layer cake laced with chocolate mousse and topped with Bacon Rice Krispie Square Pieces ( yes you read that correctly Bacon Rice Krispies). This was an over the top dessert. Also don't forget to check out the bathrooms while your here- they are complete with witty sayings on the walls and above the sinks. Don't be shy about taking pictures when you do check them out (just try not to catch anybody taking care of business). A fun and tasty experience was definitely had at Public House. 4 stars"

The poutine was really good at first, but after about 3 bites the greasy game taste set in :(  The Entrees weren't memorable, except that I really wish they had used something with more taste for a chutney than grapes- cranberries, cherries or raspberries would have been MUCH more desirable."

            "review": "Let's see: this place has an amazing sense of humor vividly portrayed throughout its men's bathroom, an excellent beer list, a wide array of incredibly rich and flavorful dishes at affordable price points, and had a good looking staff so stunningly beautiful it made me question why I still live on the East Coast.  Does anyone really think I'm not giving this place 5 stars?  \n\nLet me make something clear.  Even though everything here presents as a huge win, the food really was the star of the show.  Unlike Marilyn's and Earl of Sandwich, this place blew away my rather meager expectations.  Here is what we ordered:\n\nBUTCHER BLOCK (3 items - $24): the potted duck rillettes appear to be heavily doused in delightful black truffle and were an absolutely divine treat, the rabbit loin in porchetta basically melted in the mouth, and the sopresatta had a nice, delicate spicy kick.  Grade: A  \n\nPOUTINE ($12.50): Someone who complained about this dish in another review stated that it was too rich.  Umm.... you ordered poutine!  What did you expect?  There were nice, fresh husks of duck confit throughout the dish and the cheese curd \"gravy\" added another layer of richness.  We added the fried egg to complete the full on massacre of the heart.  Grade: A-  \n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS ($16): Personally, I thought the actual octopus was cooked perfectly; specifically, there was none of that awful chewiness one finds when people overcook the delicate meat.  The accompaniments that came with the dish were admittedly boring though.  Grade: B+\n\nTRUFFLE ARINCINIS ($7): Basically, this is fried risotto balls in a decadent cheese sauce.  I only got hints of the truffle.  Grade: B-\n\nBOSTON BIBB ($13): This was a nice refreshing counter-dish to all of our rich orders.  The classic Bibb is finished with champagne vinaigrette and studded with deliciously flavorful tomatoes.  Grade: B\n\nROASTED BONE MARROW ($15): Standing alone, the bone marrow is nice and delicate, but seemed to be missing something.  Then I tried it with the accompanying bacon marmalade.  Wow.  Again, this kitchen understands their pairings very well.  You don't expect that out of a gastropub.  Or at least I don't.  This was excellent.  Grade: A-\n\nBOUCHOT MUSSELS ($14): The mussels were nice and light, but I wish they were more plump.  The accompanying sauce base was a decadent mix of four of my favorite ingredients in the world: Belgian beer, creme fraiche, bacon, and shallots.  Grade: A\n\nPOTTED FARM EGG ($14): This fondue heavy dish was incredibly rich in the most perfect manner.  I liked the addition of asparagus, but I'm beginning to think we ate it wrong because we are convinced we found two tiny spoons within the dish.  Despite our apparent lack of intellect, this was masterful.  Grade: A\n\nBathroom Grade: A+ for the humor.\n\nService: A because even the incredibly gorgeous women that work here don't hold a candle to the amazing experience we had at Bouchon.  \n\nEven though I don't like to do repeats in a place as large as Vegas, I will be very sad if I don't come here again."

Let's keep this simple. \nFood we ordered all appetizer.\nPoutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. \nLamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.\nSteak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).\nSouthern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.\nAnd lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it. \nAs for the drinks Huge selection of wonderful craft beers. \nThe service was great and helpful. You'll see me around public house again."

The cheese curds were a fantastic taste all their own, even without above average french fries.  I had the pub burger, which, at nearly $20 is pricey.  But, it's a very very good cheeseburger, cooked perfectly, seared and juicy.  Lots of gruyere cheese.  The bacon marmalade was an interesting and welcome condiment.\n\nThis is a pretty good sized place, so you don't feel cramped.  Highly recommended, even if you don't drink beer.

Thank God we had one because a good dinner and drinks will set you back about $150.00 easy. However you can go the Pake (Cheap Chinese) way and split an entree (large plate) since they are decent size. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, they have cask beer as well as a HUGE array of wine a beer all of which that can be ordered off of their ipad menu. +1 * for techiness.\n\nHere is what we had\n\nPoutine\nAbsolutely amazing! Lots of tasty smoked duck meat and a awesome home made gravy. Not the packed brown crap but sticky homemade awesomeness! THIS IS A MUST EAT HERE!!!!\n\nLamb chop\nWe ordered it medium rare. It came out with a nice char and still maintained a nice red center in the cut. The red wine reduction was an awesome addition to the flavor and complimented the meat very well.\n\nCreamed corn lobster.\nVery good side dish! Lots of lobster in the dish not just there for namesake. It came out with a layer of cheese browned on top of it. This was a very welcome change to texture and flavor!. Not your average cream corn that comes from the jolly green giant!\n\n\n\nService and wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable . Our server had a good knowledge of the beer and menus selections. It's always comforting to hear an honest opinion when you are asking about menu items. \n\n\n\nOverall it was a good experience. The restaurant has very good ambiance by itself however like most casino restaurants, they don't discriminate on the patrons dress code so Bobby Joe and Bubba in their cut off T-shirts and holy jeans really detract from the \"zen\" ambiance and atmosphere that they are going for. \n\n\nThis place is a hidden gem for beer connoisseurs and foodies alike.

As we walked back through Palazzo to the Venetial we stumbled upon this place as they were opening.   To our surprise, they actually carried the network package so they had our game on.   We were able to find a really comfy couch and table that looked right at the game, perfect.   There was a nice bar on the side that quickly became packed.   They greeted us quickly with an IPad that contained the drink menu.  Pretty neat!    They have a very strong beer collection with different types of flights, etc.  \n\nWe ordered a light flight of beers.   The local beer which was among them was good (forgot the name).   We ordered a cheese platter that was good except the grilled bread was cold.  We also ordered their wings, which are not traditional wings--they were in green chili/tomatillo type sauce and were soooo good.   Hard to eat but really good.   Wear an extra napkin and you'll be fine.   The rest of the menu looked really good---bone marrow, fresh seafood platter with lobster, oysters, shrimp, etc, a short rib sandwich, steaks, and burgers.  \n\nThe waitress was very efficient and checked on us a million times.

Quite enjoyable, (but notice I have not returned for 2 years).  This time took my guy (DARK BEER LOVER).  We went Friday nite @ 10pm (Vegas \"come alive time\").  As we approached, the greeting gal snapped out \"dining room is closed, you can sit at bar if you want\".  We didn't 'want'.  Left for dinner at LAVO.\nOK, we went back last night at daylight savings time..early 6-7 somewhere around there.  \nATMOSPHERE 3-4 STARS.  I like DARK, RICH DECOR,COZY- so much of Vegas suits me.\nBut with that said, I also like to sit with my man at my side, not at a 'mini 2-top' not big enough for two dinner plates.  So I refused the 2-top and opted for the 4-top next to it. Host didn't hesitate to move me when I asked. Good, because I refuse to pay high prices ever again and eat off a \"pedestal top\", constantly re-arranging plates and glasses to \"fit\".\nFOOD & PRICE-  3-4 STARS.  We shared: Public House Caesar salad-$13, Public House burger & fries-$19, and side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms-$12, me red wine/ Zin $11, and my guy the 'Big & Dark Sampler' $17 (4-6 oz samples) We also had 1 cr\u00e8me Brulee $9 and a coffee- $2.95 TOTAL 90.75.\nSalad so small it was like a cup of soup or less size each when divided. Dressing was so sour it made my mouth pucker and the bacon cut into little 1 1/2 inch strings and fried into 'glass shards', I could not chew it!  I hope it does not slice me on the way 'thru'.  I gave to my guy and he said it was impossible for him to chew. =FORGET IT!\nBurger, good, but I was hungry.  Fresh bun and stewed tomato with dressing of sorts and lettuce-it was GOOD. I've had GOOD for much lower prices, BUT I knew the price going in.  I don't eat fries so can't judge, they were served in a small 6 oz or so s.steel cup.  Mushrooms very tasty, but I kept thinking of the giant tub in my fridge I got for $3.50- but hey- I didn't have to cook them and YES I pay for ATMOSPHERE- and I do understand the trend in Vegas, everything is 'GOURMET'. \nZIN was ..good red zin.  Beer sampler a HIT (maybe the best deal, and yes I realize PH is famous for the HUGE beer menu). Brulee, average-good.\nSERVICE- very attentive without aggravation. \nI would take guest here, especially if they were BEER LOVERS.  But, as I find myself saying:  VEGAS has SO MANY CHOICES, if it doesn't WOW me, I keep trying other places.\nFOOTNOTE: Yes it is Sema week here, but as a single woman (not looking) I noticed 75% of clientele is MEN...just sayin gals."

Our cocktail server on our second trip was friendly, but she made a point of serving my male companion everything first to the extent that when she accidentally set down my drink in front of him, instead of moving it over to me or allowing me to take it, she put it back on the tray, served my companion his drink, and then served me mine. \n \nNote to Cocktail Servers: The guest with the penis isn't always the one who picks up the tab. Treating all guests equally will probably land you better tips overall than will treating the ones with ladyparts like second class citizens."

The beet salad was great, fresh beets, delicious goat cheese, & great dressing. The Lobster Mac n Cheese had a few chunks of tender and sweet lobster, but the cheese was not as creamy as I would have liked. The Short Ribs were tender and delicious. The Bacon Cheese Burger was a bit bland, needed seasoning and maybe some sharp cheddar instead of gruyere? The best part was discovering a new dark Russian beer from a 250 yr old brewery that made my mouth sing...not just because of the high alcohol content but also the incredible flavor!"

I order the Ahi Poke and to my surprise it was not at all what I expected. I've never had it nor have I ordered it anywhere else so I guess that's what I get for assuming! It's was a small appetizer which was perfect because I wasn't trying to get full and walk the strip for the next 8 hours. \n\nAshley assured me that the app was a small dish - when I received it I was shocked.

I asked that he swap out the hot glass with a cold one.\n\nWe started with a beet and endive salad to share.

The manager brought over another smaller plate containing more endive, but no beets.\n\nFor our entrees my guest selected their Scottish salmon ($26) and I ordered a Pub Burger ($19).\n\nInstead of fries I asked for something not so greasy. The waiter suggested sliced tomatoes. Perfect. I ordered the burger cooked medium rare. I also asked that they serve the aioli on the side. I received the fries which were cold, instead of the tomatoes i ordered. Further, the burger was as cold as the fries and the aioli was absent. Since we had theater tickets in hand for a fast approaching curtain, I returned the dish.\n\nMy guest is on a low fat diet. She asked the waiter to provide plain quinoa instead of creamy quinoa and plain brussels sprouts instead of them roasted in butter. The salmon was ordered \"medium\". The dish arrived with the salmon cooked rare and the sprouts cooked hard raw. We sent the dish back along with my burger.\n\nThe manager appeared again to apologize and to present his business card so that he could ensure a better experience should we elect to return. Overall the service was reasonable. Our waiter never asked us if we would like another drink (beer and a cocktail), which were finished with our salad.\n\nThey gave us our check for 2 drinks and the salad. \n\nPaid and departed for the theater."

The poutine fries with the sour beer gravy, cheese curds, tender pulled duck, and a fried egg on top was still to die for. The cheese curds were so delicious that my friend saved the soft pillows left in our plate for the fries that were coming with her lobster roll. However, that was the only dish that lived up to my memories. Everything else was lackluster at best, must have been the alcohol coursing through my system that skewed my judgment. This time around I got the fisherman's stew. It was too salty for my taste and the fishy seafood taste overpowered the tomato base. Rather than a stew it felt more like an oily sauce that covered soft pieces of sea bass, mussels, shrimp, and lobster. I can't deny that the seafood was cooked nicely and nothing had the texture of a rubber shoe but you're better off going with one of their sandwiches, such as the lobster roll, that's more worth it for the price tag. My friend got the roast chicken hoping that it would blow her away. She even said,\"I'm going to be that girl that orders the chicken because at these places you never think it would be good because it's so basic but it will be good!\" She quickly retracted her words when she bit into her chicken--edible but bland. Next time, I'll just stick with the poutine and a beer to wash it down."

Almost all of the apps and entrees that our 8-top ordered would not make the average person \"full\" or satisfied except for the NY steak my friend ordered (got to taste it, it was great!). Food was good but not amazing (I ordered the salmon, which was alright, but again, quite a small portion). Service was slow at times although courteous and helpful.\n\nThe environment suggested a young, upscale dining experience. It was a nice experience overall but would probably skip this place on my next visit."

The cocktail waitress was oblivious to the fact that I waited 25 minutes for my beer. Then another 22 minutes for my Manhattan.....which came SHAKEN???!! Not cool.  My partner in crime ordered a pisco sour, which was really not made proper at all. I feel a gastro-pub concept should be making standard cocktails correctly.\n\nAlso I totally understand taking a card to start a tab in the bar area, but when I ask for the check, please ask if I want you to charge my card. I generally pay cash for everything because I'm industry and get paid in tips. She charged my card without asking and after the drinks and bad service, it was frustrating.\n\nAnyways, it was a busy night, and they are still a new restaurant. Being in the business, I understand that sometimes places st have an off night. I'll be back, and hopefully this place will live up to its potential.j"

He forgot to put our appetizer in and then when we asked about it he said we had never ordered it - very awkward. By the time it arrived our meals were already there. I am glad the app did show, the \"Horsemen\" (blue cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon) were delicious. My husband liked his burger but for $19 I expect him to LOVE his burger, haha. My pork sandwich was very bland and lacking in the poblano peppers listed on the menu, plus I believe it had mayo on it instead of the garlic aioli mentioned on the menu. Both of our fries were cold. When we were ready to pay, using a Groupon we told him about when we sat down for part of the check, he said he needed to find a manager. This took almost 20 minutes. Not cool to keep customers waiting after their meal, especially since I told him from the start. I won't be returning for food, might stop by for a beer if I am already in Venetian/Palazzo."

We order by 7:25 and our food was out in perfect timing!  It was exception!!! I had the Ribs and they were mouth watering!! It had porter braised ribs, carrot mousseline, heirloom carrots, ipa battered onion ring.....and it was finger licking good, like literally!

            "review": "I was in the search for some solid craft beer to go along with some incredible food when I stumbled upon the Public House. Their slogan - \"United We Stand, Pint in Hand\" - lured me in to check out their craft beer selection. They did not have an overwhelming selection but enough to satisfy this beer geek. But before making a final decision on the Public House, I did a little research on my smartphone and found out that the Public House was created and owned by the same people who started Holsteins, which is a top notch burger joint further down the strip in the Cosmopolitan. After that point, I was confident I could not go wrong with the Public House. \n\nAppetizer: The poutine was highly recommended from a super helpful and pleasant waitress.  She said this was not only one of her favorite appetizers but one of the most ordered appetizers on the menu.  After reading the description on the menu, I was thinking how could we go wrong with the poutine? French fries covered with duck, cheese and coated with a stout gravy. Yeah it tastes as good as it sounds. My wife and I finished every single french fry, piece of duck, cheese curd, and if I had thrown my manners out of the door I would have licked every drop of the stout gravy. \n\nBeers: My first beer was the Cask Dirty Dog IPA which was dry hopped with Amarillo. For those who have not had a cask beer before, it is pretty much beer without most or all of the carbonation. It really relies on the flavors of the hops and malts. Since I'm a big fan of Amarillo hops because of their distinct citrus and orange flavors, I knew I would not be disappointed with this beer. Sure enough, without the carbonation this beer quickly disappeared. Looking for a beer with a bigger and bolder bite, the next beer I decided to try was the Lake Mead Monster Amber Ale. Advertised as imperial amber ale, this beer boasted an abv of 8.9% and was packed full of spicy bitterness. I would definitely recommend this beer to those who enjoy full bodied beers. \n\nEntrees: I had the Pub Burger and my wife had the Lobster Roll. The Pub Burger was a thick and juicy ground beef patty, with gruyere cheese, guinness mayo, fire roasted tomato, and bacon marmalade layered in between a soft and freshly baked bun. One bite and I was hooked. This was an amazing burger! Every ingredient came together nicely to produce this tasty burger. My wife's lobster roll was equally as amazing. Big chunks of perfectly cooked Maine lobster was mixed in the perfect amount of mayo to create one of the best lobster rolls she had ever tasted. The quality of the lobster was over the top. Apparently they fly in fresh Maine lobster daily and it shows in the quality of the lobster. \n\nThe Public House is an easy four stars. The service, the food and the craft beer are excellent! If the prices were lower, then I would no doubt give this place five stars.\n\nCheers!"

We took the waiters recommendations for beers based on our liking and they were really good.  We ordered the bone marrow, chicken wings and poutine. The poutine was delicious! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who comes here.  The fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly, the cheese was abundant and salty, the duck was rich and flavorful as well as the gravy they pour table side. The bone marrow was good and the portion was huge but I didn't think it was anything special.  The onion bacon jam they serve with it is stringy which makes it hard to eat.  The chicken wings have really good flavor and are super spicy but ours were soggy (which killed it for me).  \n\nWe had hopes to continue our dinner with the Devils on Horseback but we were completely stuffed.  Couldn't even finish the delicious poutine. If the prices don't scare you off, I would definitely recommend this restaurant, especially the poutine."

It's easy to find between the Venetian and Palazzo.  \n\nPublic House has a fun gastropub setting that provides an eclectic menu.  The atmosphere is fun.  The decor is a great mix of modern with rustic.  There is a large dining area with the wine 'shelter' along the back wall.  \n\nOur waitress, Shaina, could have been a little more attentive.  She was very much absent in the majority of our dining experience.  I believe that other employees visited our table more than she did.  I also noticed her enjoying visiting with her coworkers rather than waiting on her tables.  That's unfortunate.\n\nWe chose to split an appetizer of beer brined chicken wings and the prime rib french dip.  The chicken wings had a unique and different flare of glaze.  They used a calabrian chili glaze with a house made bleu cheese dressing.  These were good and much different than the usual buffalo chicken wings I'm used to everywhere else.  The wings were good size, juicy and flavorful.  \n\nThe Prime Rib French Dip sandwich was also an item I would order again.  It was your normal french dip but they also added firecracker onion straws on top.  Delicious.  The bread was fresh with the wonderful flavors of the horseradish sauce and au jus.  The accompanied french fries could have been cooked a little longer.  They were somewhat on the soggy side.  Not bad but I would ask them to cook them longer next time.  \n\nWith hopes of better service, I would come back again.  They have a great list of menu items I would love to try!"

There are so many options just on this property and The Public House has been on the list, but we tend to stray elsewhere.  After some disappointing meals at places like Delmonico and B&B Ristorante, we wanted something that had a series of good reviews, so we tried it.\n\nAshley, our server was excellent.  She was personable, quick with a smile and our orders, but most importantly she knew the menu and was able to discuss the options.  The drink menu is much more than just the beer selections.  They have an equally impressive wine and cocktail menu.  It was a Friday, so not too busy, but there was a mixture of clientele.  Anywhere from the early 30's guys at the bar, to the suits in the booths, to the tourists like ourselves.  It is a mixture.\n\nMy wife found her favorite Paso Robles winery on the list (Tobin James), so it made sense to have a meat and cheese board for lunch.  The toasty bread and brie cheese were very good.  The prosciutto was the best we have had, but the potted duck rillettes was extraordinary.  Make sure you skim the fat off the top of the jar, which leaves you with a mixture of potted duck meat and sweet cherries.  The sweet and savory flavor, along with the texture was something I have never tasted before and was delicious.  I am a crude beer guy, but pairing the bite with a taste of her zinfandel took it to an even higher level.\n\nI ordered the Scottish salmon with artichoke risotto and have to say it was one of the best dishes that I have ever had.  The salmon basically melted as soon as I put it in my mouth.  It was flaky and lite, with the added textural pop of the crispy skin.  The artichoke risotto was creamy and a perfect accompaniment to the fish.  I have had a similar dish at other restaurants and this was far and away the best.  Now that Puck has closed his restaurant at the Venetian, the Public House will be our \"Go-To\" when wanting a great meal under $100.00.  When I say that though, it is not a cheap lunch, but you get high quality food and drink."

The atmosphere is hip without being too over the top (though the music seemed a little too clubby).  And the food was delish.\n\nI had poutine -- the French Canadian import delicacy of french fries, cheese curds, and gravy.  What can make that better?  Why, try adding a fried egg AND duck confit!  that's over the top, in-no-way-subtle, richness made to pander to trendy food snob tastes.  But I don't care.  It was amazing and really epitomizes Vegas -- heart attack inducing decadence, but something everyone should try about once a year.  My wife had a little egg pot, with a fried egg and yummy accouterments. The mother-in-law had the chicken, which she said was a bit too dry but had an awesome crispy skin.\n\nPrices are a bit much (but not more than you'd expect for a Vegas hotel restaurant), but not so bad if you're careful how you order (e.g., don't go there and order a $7 Shiner or Bud Light, when for a dollar or two more you can have a delicious craft beer).\n\n4.5 stars, rounded up for the poutine and for allowing me to have my favorite beer."

The atmosphere is great here and so was the service. The only thing that was not so great was the bill that comes out after. Hehh\n\nSome of their stuffs are hit or miss but most others you pay for what you get, quality wise. The bone marrow as many had mentioned is a must try, it tastes so fatty yet so good!!! Another amazing item was the Scallop!!!! Its expensive for just three little pieces but it tasted AMAZING!!!!!!!!! For those who wants to try the foie gras, like myself unfortunately they had taken that off their menu. For those who wants to try the Poutine, you can pass on that and save yourself some money and the same for octopus under the appetizer. The same also goes for the shellfish plate, it was not worth the price for what you get! Overall this is a place to get some great foods if you're willing to pay the price. Haha"

            "review": "Let's start with the good:\n\nThe atmosphere.  Although I expected this place to be MUCH bigger, I really dug the decor.  I think it was really nice, although not as much of a \"pub\" setting, and really not as casual as I imagined.\n\nThe beer/wine/cocktail selection is offered on an iPad, so that is pretty cool.  I am a beer drinker, so it was great to have the entire collection available right at your fingertips, with as much (or little) information as you would like about the beer.  They also have their very own Cicerone, which is the beer equivalent of a Sommelier, which is pretty damn cool.  I didn't speak to said Cicerone, but I am sure he is awesome.  However, I was not impressed by their current draft selection, or the prices.  But alas, this is the Las Vegas Strip, and affordability may be asking too much.  I ended up ordering the Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest, so it is definitely nice to see them supporting a local brewery.\n\nThe poutine was amazing.  I've seen some complaints about the price ($10), however I don't think that is too much.  It is a pile of french fries, with cheese curds, duck confit and bordelaise sauce (apparently the Public House take on \"gravy\").  It is really salty, so beware.  Great with beer.  I would definitely come back for this alone.\n\nThe devils on horseback were also delicious.  These are bleu cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped dates.  The bleu cheese is REALLY strong (which is A-OK in my book), so some people may be caught off guard with this.  But anything with bacon is pretty amazing anyway you do it, in my opinion. :)\n\nNow the bad (Sorry!):\n\nAlthough it was a Monday night, and we arrived around 6:00pm, the lounge area was full.  The hostess asked if we would be having dinner or just appetizers. We said we were unsure, but were in a hurry and would probably just have appetizers.  She told us it was open seating in the lounge and to seat ourselves.  We turned around, to where there were obviously no seats and looked back at her, dumbfounded.  Luckily, the Manager happened to be standing next to her and told her to seat us in the EMPTY dining room.  She asked if we prefered a table or booth and we said booth.  She then said that all of the booths were reserved.  Um, OK....then why did you ask?  Anyhow, as I mentioned, we were in a bit of a hurry.  She led us to a small table for 2.  Otherwise, she was nice.\n\nIn addition to the items above, we also ordered the foie gras.  I was not a fan, and normally I LOVE foie gras.  I can't say what it is I didn't like about it....it seemed undercooked or just not as good as any that I've had before.  I would not order it again.\n\nThe service was good, but we had 1 server approach us, take our order, and then a few minutes later another server approached us and told us that Sarah had \"gone home because it was so slow,\" and that he would be taking over. So, \"where were we at?\"  Obviously our server told him nothing, like the fact that we had already ordered, etc.  It was kind of weird.  But he was very attentive and nice.\n\nOverall, I liked Public House.  It didn't totally live up to my expectations.  I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make a trip there."

We also ordered the duck pasta which was pretty good and filling even as an appetizer.  My wife enjoyed the french dip very much but I think I was too full to enjoy it.  The meat even though fully cooked was very soft.  I wouldn't mind coming back but won't go out of my way to eat here though."

We had the rib-eye steak and a hamburger and thought that both were properly cooked and tasty. The waiter was quite cooperative in serving our food in a timely manner so we could make an evening show. We didn't give it 5-stars only because of the atmosphere--not exactly a pub, but not an elegant surroundings. We weren't sure what to make of the popsicle in the ceiling--Art Deco?. The cost is a bit on the pricey side so your expectations may be a bit high. But we would definitely go back there again."

It comes with Pretzel Bread, which makes this Sandwich unique and delish.  There's a healthy serving of Ham too as you can see from the pic I took.....it really should be called a \"Chicken and Ham\" Sandwich.\n\nMy colleagues had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Burger....they both said it was awesome.\n\nThe best part of our dining experience was our server.  She was very helpful and helped us play a practical joke on another table of colleagues that were dining across the restaurants.  She was great.\n\nOverall, this is a solid restaurant.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"

I had read great things about the fried chicken at the Public House  in \"SEVEN\" magazine so my lady and I fought the traffic and looked forward to a couple of drinks and a nice dinner.  Unfortunately, The public House is just another Strip property doing its level best to over charge the tourists and serve ordinary food and drinks at extraordinary prices.  I ordered a vodka on the rocks and I'm not kidding when I tell you that it had one half of an inch of vodka.  When I pointed this out to the waiter who was clearly embarassed at the pour, he apologized and told me that each pour was measured by the management.  The drink was $13.00 for a jigger.  When we received our chicken, there were three lonely little pieces all by themselves on the plate that looked to be the size of Cornish game hen and tasted like fried cardboard.  All in all, a pathetic showing for what looks to be a nice restaurant.  Unfortunately, I have seen a disturbing trend on the Strip, marginal service, insane prices and  unmemorable food.   Pass on this place."

They actually fall of the bone and you have to knife and fork it.\n\nScallops - Perfectly cooked, but beware that onions are a main attraction and isn't listed that way on the menu.\n\nAny item from the butcher block/cheese shop make for a great starter, but the devil's on horseback (blue cheese stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon...on the bar menu) are a must-have.\n\nI haven't mentioned too much about the beer, but I assure you any beer lover will be in heaven.

A reservation that actually works and doesn't make you wait is fantastic.  \n\nThe place has a great decor...intimate but in a casual way. My boyfriend ordered the pub burger; it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. It came with french fries which had an herb seasoning that I spent like 10 minutes trying to figure out and couldn't (in a good way). \n\nI ordered the short ribs..you gotta order the short ribs. They are so tender and  comes with a delicious sauce that's definitely not diet friendly, but AMAZING. It comes a butternut squash puree that  has the texture of mashed potatoes but a little lighter (deceptively so, I assume). \n\nThe beer selection is huge and the waiter was super helpful in helping lost people like me pick from the menu. \n\nI would totally come back here without the groupon.

I selected this place because of the great Yelp! reviews and the fact that they had an extensive beer selection which I was hoping that my party would take advantage of.\n\nWe got there on time and were seated immediately. Unfortunately, the good times kind of stopped there.\n\nAfter coming by to get our drink orders, it took quite some time before our drinks came and for our order to be taken. I can't speak for the folks on the other side of the table, but my side (coincidentally the side that ordered the steaks) didn't have very good luck with the cook temps. We all ordered medium rare and ended up getting steaks on the Medium to Medium well side. If the steaks were cooked better, I'm sure it would've been a little bit more enjoyable but overall, we were all in agreement that they were a little oversalted as well.\n\nI know a party of 10 can be a handful and perhaps they didn't have the right staff to accommodate, but overall I felt that we were a little neglected. After going to other bachelor parties that had impeccable service for even larger parties, it's hard to give this place a ringing endorsement.\n\nMaybe good for smaller parties, but based on my experience, I'd avoid if you have a large group."

When we arrived the table was setup in a semi private room which was nice but the general manager Mark and the Cicerone/manager Russell were not present. I expected at least one of them would have been there to say hello or greet us. No big deal though and we went and sat down. Our waiter then brings menus by and starts going over a few things and I told him that we had a prearranged menu with beer/whiskey pairing and he had absolutely no idea about it whatsoever. Great.....Luckily I had my email chain with the beer and whiskey pairings and we got it somewhat sorted out other than the fact that 2 of the beers we had put on the list they were out of. Ugh. The hits just kept coming. Our server did a good job handling the debacle that was no fault of his own but he did seem at times to be either annoyed by us or just wanted to get our table handled quickly since he knew he would get 18% guaranteed since our party was large.\n\nOn to the food:\n\nPoutine- Solid dish and we added the fried egg on top. \nOctopus - Another good appetizer but it didn't wow me. I would go with the poutine over this all day but the contrast between the two was nice.\nBeet Salad - My favorite dish on the list. Great flavor and fresh beets. \nPork Chop - This was recommended to me and it was sadly overcooked which is the last thing you ever want with pork. The dish had promise but was prepared incorrectly.\nFries - Standard shoestring fries, good but nothing special.\n\nBeer and Whiskey:\nThe beer selection was sadly disappointing. I have been to many other places that don't even focus on craft beers that have a larger selection. We had the Big Trout Slayer and the Grimbergem Blonde with the appetizers.\n\nI went with the whiskey pairing with the main dish and I really enjoyed it. I am glad I decided to go that route versus the smaller beer selection, many of which were easy to find and get at home.\n\nOverall, the food was a 3.5 or 4 but the lack of organization for a planned group over a month in advance and a limited beer selection for a place that prides itself on that was sadly disappointing. The service overall was okay but again there were times when I thought he was \"inconvenienced\" by us. I want to say I would give it another shot but I don't know."

Steaks, a burger of good repute, some imaginative salads and a giant beer list of over 250 selections.\n\nSo, of course, I started with the Prosecco. What?! Yeah, I felt like it in this heavy 100 degree heat. It worked fine. The wine and beer list is available in a book or on an iPad; both were at our table. Those who ordered salads liked them. I nibbled on the Baby Lettuce & Fennel\nBlue Cheese Crumbles, Figs, Pistachio, Citrus Balsamic Vinaigrette. I would have ordered my own but I learned a small frise salad came with many entrees. The fried oysters looked good, and were reportedly very nice. \n\nI held out for the bone-in Ribeye, one of my very favorites. It's a popular cut, and the priciest on the menu as well as the largest at 18 oz. It was very satisfying. Of course the chef's butter on top never hurts -- and in my book, I think that's actually cheating as one can hide a lot of sins behind butter, garlic and even a dash of lemon. Still, it didn't detract from the Creek Farms Natural Black Angus Beef, which is vegetarian fed, and free from hormones and other bad stuff. Cooked to order, and it was enough for me to have held-off on the starters.  Others at our table had the Filet, or the Free-range Chicken, or even the Quail and Waffles. The last one is a nice take on Chicken n Waffles, of course. Though, it was reported that the quail was a bit hard to really get at in the 'meaty' way chicken is. \n\nService occasionally bobbled the ball. A slight mix-up on a drink; a salad that was to have been dressing on the side -- and it's replacement took awhile. ('Maybe they're washing it off my salad', went the wisecrack). I enjoyed a big red wine from Sonoma or Alexander Valley. I was asked if I wanted another long after my steak was gone. Similarly, another diner in our party did order another glass of wine, but had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a refill.\n\nA few service quibbles aside, PH was a solid choice. The desserts did not blow us away by their description, so we left that for later in the evening."

Seeing that the Vegas Strip has always been a bit of a craft beer (ahem) desert, on paper this seemed to be exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nI soon arrived in Las Vegas and high-tailed it to Public House immediately after dropping my bags at The Flamingo. I was greeted by a wonderfully attentive and friendly staff at the bar. I must admit that these young and attractive barkeeps had me wondering if they really knew their chops when it came to beer. Next thing I knew I was discussing the comparative qualities of various sour beer varieties with one of the female servers which (somewhat embarrassingly) really impressed me. So I hereby apologize to all young, attractive and female beer geeks out there. I will never prejudge you again!\n\nSo the draft and bottle selection was impressive indeed. I started with a cask-conditioned Firestone Walker porter which was quite tasty and truly something I might not ever find elsewhere. Then I took a run down the American/Imperial IPA list enjoying several varieties by Uinta (Hop Notch, yum!), Stone and Lagunitas. All fresh and served in proper glassware (always a nice touch).\n\nAlas it was time for a nosh. Impressive menu and definitely on the high-brow end of what one might expect for \"pub grub\". Then again Public House *is* a gastropub after all and they truly live up with their food offerings. I opted for the scallops over oxtail stew. At $29 I was a little apprehensive when I might have been just as happy with a burger and fries at this point. However, let me tell you that this was one of the most fantastic dishes I've ever enjoyed. The aroma of the huge pan-seared scallops over rich red-wine laced oxtail stew demanded my immediate attention (as well as the attention of several others seated at the bar). I'm a meat and potatoes guy so the somewhat small portion had me a bit concerned, but the richness of this flavor-packed entree reinforced the old adage of 'quality over quantity.' Wow, so very happy after this meal.\n\nNeedless to say, I found myself back at Public House several times that week and found myself succumbing to the craving for a second helping of the scallops. Every bit as good the second time! Even better paired with a nice dark porter.\n\nAlready looking forward to my next trip to Vegas and specifically Public House! Beer geeks (and foodies) rejoice!"

She got me a menu and in a few min.  a friendly guy brought cutlery, napkin and wedges for the wobbly table. \nI ordered the house pickles and the burger which came with herb fries. The pickles were ok but should have been drained before serving, about a quarter inch of vinegar on plate. Except for the peppers, everything kind of tasted the same. good but kind of boring. Great crunch though. Not worth the $6\nBurger, for $19, was not so great. Patty was cooked correctly but seemed unseasoned. Bun is like a across between a classic bun and an english muffin -odd. I felt like I had to eat fast to keep it from falling apart, bottom of bun got  very soaked. Cheese was partly melted, partly firm and waxy which made for a poor mouth feel.  The burger had good potential, but for the price was very disappointing. \nThe herb fries were about the worst I've had anywhere. Shoestring cut, greasy, mealy, just bad. I left them.\nService, aside from a water refill,  was basically non existent. I got up to get my drinks from the bar, got up to order food from the bartender and I got up to ask for my check.

Public House inside The Venetian has quite the beer selection, and serves up some tasty food to accompany it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine, that delicious poutine.  Fries, gravy, duck, cheese curds and a fried egg.  I like all of these things on their own; but together?  I almost didn't want to share.  Everything combines to create a very savory, fancy, bar food appetizer.  A bit salty, but it was okay since we had plenty of beer available to wash it down with.  I see myself ordering this every time I come to Public house.  \n\nFor dinner I had the Pub Burger, which I was a bit leery about.  Anytime a burger approaches the $20 price point, I better be getting something special.  The standouts here were the bacon marmalade, roasted tomato and aioli.  This was not a dry burger; it was juicy and had plenty of sauce and flavors going for it.  \n\nBetween these two dishes, I think ordering one of each and sharing with someone makes for a good meal to carb up and prepare for more beer.  I don't find myself in the Venetian very often (although I've been there three times in the past week...), but Public House does a very good job of giving me a reason to go back."

We got the wings and the shrimp.  \nI got the hamburger, which was VERY flavorful - but the buns were too big and toasted, which I felt take away from the flavor of the meat and toppings.  \ngood, not great."

A little bit into our meal the place started filling up to capacity with convention goers.   We were seated in a side room toward the back of the restaurant where the tables were spaced out nicely and the chairs big and comfy.  \n\nI had their chicken sandwich with fries and to drink I had their Fruli Strawberry beer.  I requested for one ingredient to be left out of my sandwich because I was unfamiliar with it, and while that may have made it dry I still really enjoyed my sandwich and thought it was pretty tasty.  Their fries were absolutely delicious!  As for my drink, pretty good too :)  Dessert though was unmemorable.  I can't quite recall what exactly we had (so that should tell you something) but I do know that I wasn't crazy about it.  \n\nYay for a tasty meal (minus dessert), good service, and nice ambiance!

Public House is a gastropub, serving up refined casual fares and a huge beer selection. It's located in The Venetian on Las Vegas Strip.\n\nAlthough we had reservations to almost all of the restaurants we dined at, Public House was probably the only restaurant that we actually needed that reservation to get seated, it was bustling with people. Again, the restaurant was beautifully decorated inside and out. Of course it had to be a looker, it was steps away from the Venetian's Grand Canal.\n\nWe had the Smothered Prawns, Grilled Octopus, Forest Mushroom, Yukon Potato Puree with Black Truffle Oil and Short Ribs. \n\nThe Smothered Prawns did not have a great deal of flavour, this is what happens when you cook seafood with beer instead of wine... I should have known better! I learned long time ago to always get mussels steamed in a wine broth, not mussels steamed in a beer broth. The Grilled Octopus had a strange texture, it was not springy or chewy, it was... mushy. Yep, the first time I had mushy grilled octopus and we didn't finish this dish. The stars of the meal were the Forest Mushrooms (sauteed mushrooms, what's not to love) and the Yukon Potato Puree (perfectly creamy). The Short Rib all went to the red-meat-eater that I dined with. He enjoyed it, so he says. \n\nPlease check out my blog, where I documented my entire Las Vegas trip.

Everyone absolutely loved it, even my one friend who is an extreme foodie and does not like most places we pick out.  So everyone was wanting to go back this year.  We had an 8:30 Sunday reservation so it was not crowded.  Due to a few people stuck at a Black Jack table we had a party of 5.  It took forever to get our server to initially stop by the table (at least 10 minutes).  Then our drink order took forever to get to our table.  There were not that many tables filled in the restaurant.  When we finally got to order we ordered our entrees and some of us ordered a salad or an appetizer.  After 30 minutes we still had not received even our salad or appetizer.  My friend who used to be a server at several fine dining restaurants was getting a little impatient at how ridiculous the ticket time was taking.  He kindly asked the server for a manager.  It took her a bit to come over (tall, skinny African American younger woman), but when he explained the situation saying our server was super nice, but he clearly must be drastically in the weeds since it was taking him forever for the drinks and that we had not seen any food.  She did not seem to care one bit, she seem unapologetic, and said she would check on it.  When she came back after awhile, she said it would be coming, what the heck does that even mean?  My buddy said just bring us the check we were leaving (we were there for over an hour at this point with only one round of drinks to show for it the second round had not even gotten there).  She said okay, attempted no customer recovery.  When she brought the check, she had overcharged us by $25!  I was so disgusted on how terrible this place has become in just a year.  I will never go back and on my way out I told 4 different parties walking in how bad this place was, I at least got one to turn around."

I loved the joint: quaint, relaxing ambience, intimate. The staff engaged with excellent service, and although we beat the oncoming lunch rush, service to our table did slow down a bit as it targeted a larger spread; understandble. Bathrooms clean and stocked. Good review so far huh? That's where most of the stars go to.\n\nThe food was good. Don't get me wrong. If someone suggested eating here again though, I'd likely suggest a different spot because, well this is Vegas and it's just drowning in new places to get your Noms on. \n\nWith Boothang and I being appetizer nerds, we immediately put our hands down for the Foie Gras and Roasted Bone Marrow. We've definitely had our fix on some bomb ass decadent foie gras, but unfortunately it wasn't this one. It was served cold with an assortment of jams on a tiny bed of bread sopping in balsamic. The flavors and textures melded well, but nothing slapped my face in amazement. I like to be slapped in the face. The bone marrow was bomb, as bone marrow always is. If you haven't tried bone marrow before, it may not be a terrible idea to get it here, because it was probably the most enjoyable part of our lunch experience here. Just lather that oily melting goodness onto your grilled bread and you're good to go. It came with caramelized onions too, also very yums in accompaniment with the marrow, but don't put too much or you'll loose your appreciation for the fatty goodness of marrow. With that said, the best bone marrow I've experience had nice grilled crusty bread, with just wedges of lemon along with the well roasted and salty marrow... the very things to enhance marrow.\n\nFor lunch, Boothang had the French Dip Sandwich, which he very much enjoyed. I feel you can never go wrong with a bunch a thinly sliced beef, melted provolone, wedged between bread and dipped in a salty beefy au jus, but the bread was what made this sandwich a winner. Extremely soft, not too bready, not overly toasted but enough that each bite had a crispness to it. Bomb in my opinion. \n\nI was craving fresh cold seafood like a mother, so I decided to get myself the the petite seafood platter $58 supposedly to share between 2-3 people as an appetizer. It was fine, but a bit overpriced for what it was. The oysters were tiny and didn't seem too fresh. The shrimp were large and plump... almost the same size as the mini lobster tail. Poke was good, but not your typical poke; it was tangy and briney from the capers. It was a good portion for someone that was eating lunch, however, for $60, I could go to my local fish market (I live in San Diego) and get all the same foods at a higher quality seafood for half the price. I'm a seafood head, and this was a bit of a disappointment. \n\nAll in all, I didn't enjoy this jam as much as I thought I would. Again, like many reviews, this is quite subjective to the fact we came here solely for lunch and did not try any steaks which seemed to be a popular fix on the menu. Although money isn't too much of an issue, this time around, $130 for lunch that was \"ok\" got me walking away like \"Meh... next time let's do In-N-Out\"."

In any case, this place describes itself as a gastropub.\n\n***The Menu***\nLots and lots of beer - more than 200 varieties. I counted 24 taps and 3 casks. Food offerings are more adventurous than those found at a typical bar - especially the appetizers. Thus, there is poutine, foie gras, bone marrow and octopus.\n\n***The Atmosphere***\nI sat at the bar, so my comments are restricted to that area. At 7 pm on a Saturday, it was moderately full, and got busier as the evening progressed. However, it never felt crowded, and even the loud rock music wasn't bothersome. It's a good place you can sit around, watch one of the television sports games, and talk to other patrons.\n\n***The Food***\nI decided on two appetizers, figuring that would make a light meal: poutine; bouchot mussels with beer, shallots, bacon and cr\u00e8me fraiche. Alcohol consisted of one bottle of Sam Smith's Pale Ale. The mussels were slightly gritty, and not especially plump. However, the rich sauce hid some of that, and there was plenty of toasted bread to sop everything up. Not good for a restaurant, but not bad for a bar. Now, about the poutine: for the uninitiated, poutine is a French Canadian dish made with french fries, cheese curds and gravy; other stuff is sometimes added. Public House's poutine consisted of: a very large bowl of thin, crisp french fries; a small amount of gravy; two modest pieces of cheese curd; a generous amount of duck; a fried egg (optional). This was the first time I had ever tried the stuff, so take my comments with a grain of salt*. However, I've got to believe there are better versions out there. This version was seriously lacking in cheese and gravy, yet still managed to be very salty.\n\n(*As a native of Bawlmer, Merlin, I know that french fries are meant to be served with gravy only; cheese curds are for furriners.)\n\n***Summary***\nI liked Public House's atmosphere, and would consider returning for a beer or two. However, my first experience makes me wary of ordering food again. The problem may lie in expectations. Describing itself as a gastropub, I expected restaurant quality food; I got bar quality food. It might be best to order a small snack to go with your beer, and eat dinner elsewhere.\n\n***The Bill***\nThe meal was $27, plus drinks, tax and tip."

I need to go back to get the full experience.  Here's what happened:\n\nI planned on meeting a buddy here and was extremely excited for many reasons.  I don't really get out to bars much anymore so when I do, I get all jacked up.  We got to Public House only to find it completely closed for an event.  I can understand closing the restaurant, but the bar too?  Anyway, we we went somewhere else.  The next day I wrote a short e-mail to say I was a little disappointed.  The manager Mark wrote back and was very awesome in expressing his apologies and invited me back to check it out.  It just so happens that I was able to meet my friend the next night.\n\nWe got to Public House to find there was another event but Mark got us in this time.  Awesome customer service!  We were escorted to the bar and the bartender hooked us up with a couple of Cask Ales.  Then he didn't look at us for about 30 minutes.  Three bartenders and we had empty beer glasses for about 15 minutes.  Finally we got one of them to get us another drink.  We asked if they were serving food and they told us the kitchen was closed for the night.  This was at 9:00.  Very disappointing because I wanted to get some Poutine.\n\nTowards the end of the night Russell, the Cicerone, came over and was totally awesome.  He talked to us for a few minutes and poured us some more Cask Ale.  As great as the managers were, I have to say that the overall experience left a lot to be desired.  I can get on board with them being rented out but there's no excuse for three bartenders to completely ignore anyone."

Really?? I'm so sick of these establishments in Vegas casinos that pretend to be upscale, trendy places, but actually are very cheap when it comes to the number of staff members they keep around when the hours get a little later. I assume someone crunched the numbers and decided it was less profitable to keep kitchen staff around after 10:00 and could save a few bucks by closing at 11:00. So much for taking care of the customers who come in to spend their money....Not to mention, the bartender seemed to want to get everyone out ASAP so he could close up. I'd like to provide my opinion on the food, but oh! It's after 10:00pm! No one eats anything this late! So very late for Friday night in Vegas! Really?"

            "review": "Beer heaven. The pipes along the ceiling leading to the bar may be fake, but there's nothing bogus about the quality of the beer and food. There's no doubt that they take their drink menu seriously. They employ a cicerone (beer version of a sommelier) who has crafted a beer menu second to none. With a good mix of popular craft brews and lesser known ones, there's something for everyone. The menu also includes several barrel aged beer and cask beer. If you're as uninformed as me, take a few moments to chat with the cicerone, Russell Gardner, who will gladly drop some knowledge on you.\n\nMake sure you look at the serving size listed in the menu for each beer. I ordered the Uinta Labrynth Black Ale without doing so and ended up with a whole bottle (750ml) all for myself. Not that I minded... it was so good that I didn't want to share. It was a good thing that my wife was willing to drive home.\n\nThe food here is a perfect match for the beer. It isn't just upscale bar food. The menu is full of unique and thoughtful interpretations of classic comfort food.\n\nAppetizers and small bites that our party of four sampled included olives ($6), a selection of three cheeses ($16), and Devils on Horseback ($6), their take on stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. The best app we tried was their Bouchot mussels ($14) which consisted of a dozen or so bivalves in a rich, slightly creamy broth of wit beer and creme fraiche. There was plenty of toast with the dish to sop up every drop. It was so good there was no way we were going to let any go to waste.\n\nFor the main course the French onion soup ($9) was a hit, as was the Lamb pierogies ($26) -- a creative version of \"Shepherd's Pie\" with the dumplings resting atop a potato puree and finished with some lamb jus. The short rib ($29) was a hefty portion of tender beef, but I found it to be too fatty and the sauce bordering on gummy. But, the butternut squash puree and onion rings that came with it were amazing.\n\nAlong with the entrees, we tired the brussel sprouts ($8), which could have cooked a touch longer, and the heirloom beets ($11.50). Even if you hate beets, it's a must! It's the kind of dish that you'll be fighting over. The goat ricotta cheese mouse gave it a sweet taste that was balanced out by the acidity and a touch of bitterness from the other ingredients. \n\nThe service made the experience even better. The server and cicerone were both charming and knowledgeable and the manager even stopped by to make sure we enjoyed everything. With the success of Holsteins and the Barrymore it's no fluke that Block 16 Hospitality has delivered another hit with Public House. They seem to have a solid understanding of what it takes to have a flourishing restaurant.\n\n4.5 Stars"

Yes.\n\nBut they advertise as a relaxed, 'speakeasy' pub that serves 'pub favourites'-and really, it is anything but that.\n\nThe food was very frou frou (if we wanted fine dining-I wouldn't have chosen a 'pub' to eat at). The serving size was ridiculously small-and usually when it's a small serving it's packed with flavour...nope, not here. Small, over-priced, NON-PUB food. \nI had the 'rib'. The serving of 'rib' was the size of 3 fingers and half of the rib was fat. The rib was accompanied with 2 small, cold onion rings (with very little flavour) and 3tablespoons of sweet peas that were pureed. I ordered this based on server recommended, and at $29 I was left with extremely bland and mostly inedible small servings of food. My dining guest was served the wrong beer-and the mistake was not corrected. \n\nThere was no sign of the beer cicerone that they advertise. And the server provided very little knowledge about the beer.\n\nOverall, we came for the beer and the fun twist on 'pub food' that they advertise. We felt completely let down with both (other than the selection of beer)"

Our service was great and the food was pretty good. They have a great beer selection.\n\nI was a bit confused on the dress of our waitress. She almost looked like a combo of the Tilted Kilt and Britney Spears with her outfit. Knee high, short plaid skirt and small white top with her chest hanging out. It was just weird for me a little bit. It just didn't make sense with how I remember my other visits to the Public House. She was a beautiful girl, just looked uncomfortable wielding food and booze around in the restaurant dressed like that. Not a big deal, just a mention. It just kind of gave a more trashy vibe. It was just weird. I think since she's beautiful and professional, she would still look great in more clothing and perhaps be more comfortable at work. \n\nIf you can get a sofa with a mirror table I would suggest it towards the front. They are really fun and comfortable. They make the dinner more intimate yet relaxed."

I wanted to eat everything on the menu, but contented myself (no, actually gorged) on their poutine.  Oh, dirty, dirty poutine.  It's salty, so you'll need a beer to wash that goodness down.

Despite the hustle and bustle of the Venetian and the general popularity of The Grand Canal Shoppes the area surrounding Public House is very calm. Something tells me that's the way the owners like it.\n\nWhen you walk into the restaurant you'll find a bar and tvs to your left. While straight ahead you'll be greeted by one of the many (there were three when we showed up) hostesses on staff. \n\nWhen you walk in you might be so taken with the beauty of the hostesses that you won't take the time to look at your surroundings. Public House is adorned in dark wood, calming atmosphere. It reminds me of old school steakhouses. Everything about the place just seemed subdued, making it an ideal atmosphere to take your lady for an intimate dinner before the rowdiness that are Vegas clubs. \n\nOnce you get seated you get to take a look at the menus. Public House is noted for it's beer and wine selection. While they do have a wine list, they will bring the staff sommelier by to answer any questions you might have about the wine selection. If beer is what you have a taste for they do have a pretty decent selection for you to peruse. The biggest downside to the beer menu is that it is on an iPad. This is fine if your party is 2 people, not so fun when you have 8. \n\nThe menu is typical of an American upscale restaurant. Yes, it's expensive. You're at the Venetian, on the strip, in Vegas. You're going to make it rain for dinner whether you want to or not. \n\nMy party ran the gauntlet of what Public House had to offer. The chicken wing were tossed in a spicy but tasty chill glaze. The bone marrow was large with a taste to back it up. I had never had poutine fries before but they made me a believer. \n\nAt this point you're probably wondering why I'm giving Public House 3 stars (ordering beer off an iPad can't be that bad right?). Sadly, not all the entrees lived up to the rest of the experience. \n\nI personally had the fried chicken. The  waiter said it was the best in Vegas. As a matter of fact every employee who came by said it was the best they had ever had.  When the waiter came and dropped of my plate he whispered \"You're going to love this.\" Not so much... For me the skin wasn't all that crispy and lacked flavor. For my buddy sitting across the table from me, it was just too dry. Many in our party had the burger. I think one finished it. All complained that it was overly greasy. I know I know it's a burger, but you expect more out of a place this upscale. \n\nThe steaks and shellfish platters were well done. My friends gave them rave reviews and left the rest of us jealous. \n\nThe service was ok. Nothing to complain about, but nothing memorable. \n\nOverall, I think this is a nice place to eat. If you're in a small party and  stick to the entrees in the center of the menu you will have a fantastic time and eat some amazing food. Otherwise, you're in for an average dinner experience."

Pinot Brasserie and Aquanox, say hello to your new neighbor/competition. Chef Anthony Meidenbauer of Holstein's & The Barrymore is the mastermind behind the menu and he didn't let me down.\n\nSHORT RIBS: Most memorable part of the meal? SHORTRIBS. Our server recommended the pork loin and the diver scallops but something about shortribs seemed so tempting. Korean people like shortribs--kalbi duh... Braised and marinated in a bordelaise sauce, the meat was so soft and tender I could almost get through it knife-less. At $29, and the priciest thing we ordered, the meat portion was quite healthy served alongside a butternut squash mash and a couple onion rings. The mash was unfortunately overladen with butter. And the onion rings didn't stay crispy for long. \n\nBONE MARROW: I wish they cut the bone in half then roasted it. They served 3 pieces of marrow bone; one of which looked like all the marrow had leaked out of the bottom (the main reason why i like mine sliced in half before being cooked). However disappointed I was to scrape the last bits out of that bone, the other 2 were 100% amazing. Marrow, carmelized onion on a piece of crusty bread--win. $14\n\nCANADIAN-FRIENDLY: Not that any place is anti-Canadian, but with as many people I meet on the Strip from the North, I might as well mention Public House serves POUTINE! The upscale Vegas version of course: crispy shoestring fries, cheese curds, and duck confit that will cause some unintentional drooling. All topped with bordelaise \"gravy.\" They really like bordelaise here? As delicious as this was, I found it a tad bit on the salty side and the cheese left a bit of grease at the bottom of the bowl. $9\n\nVARIETY: The menu is reasonably sized and moderately priced offering many options from all the usual animals: cow, chicken, pig. But they also feature quail and other classics from the sea. The person I was with isn't a seafood person; but next time, I'm not holding back! I wanna get into some of the muscles and oysters here.\n\nBEER: There are a million beers on the menu but I had a couple glasses of one of my favorites: Delirium Tremens--a belgium ale that's so much better on tap and almost 2x the alcohol content of regular beer. Next time, I'll venture to try some obscure varieties I've never heard of.\n\nThe food quality in lieu of the beer offerings and dining environment make Public House a shoe-in on my hit list. The music isn't so loud where you can't have a casual business meeting here. But the decor and low-lighting makes this a wonderful date spot. Looks like this place gets pretty packed so I recommend making a reservation.\n\nDon't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)"

The really nice hostess seated me and then handed me an iPad for a wine menu (stupid not hip as it took longer to figure it out than it would to just look at a printed list). As I was trying to figure out the iPad my waiter Mario arrived and saw I was looking for wine and having trouble so he just took over. I told him what I like in a white wine and he brought me a delicious glass of Paul Hobbs chardonnay and it was magnificent. It was all uphill from there.  \nOnce he returned with my wine and iced tea I asked him to suggest a few different items and told him I was in the mood for fish. He brought me ale brined wings to start and then the halibut fish n chips  Both were amazing. The wings were not your typical Hooters style buffalo, they were deep, smokey and tangy. The fish n chips was the BEST I'VE EVER HAD!  \nWhile the food & drink was delicious, Mario was the real highlight of my visit to Public House.  He was knowledgeable about what he was serving (as all servers should be) but it was his warm friendly personality that made my visit special. He actually engaged me in conversation and told me several really funny jokes. A couple of times his friend Shana joined in and they both had me in stitches. If you dine alone as often as I do you know just how welcome a pleasant, funny server can be. Btw Mario is pretty easy on the eyes too.\nMario made such a positive impression that later in the weekend I took some friends to Public House for dinner but when we found out Mario wasn't working that evening we chose Table 10 instead. Shame too because I was looking forward to trying something new.  \nTo sum it up, Public House is a must dine on your next trip to Vegas if you can get past the fact that it's in a building that Sheldon Adelson owns. And when you visit I highly recommend you ask for a table with Mario or Shana."

I overheard another customer ordering a martini and the bartender asked him plenty of questions about how the customer wanted his drink so he could \"dial it in just right.\"\n\nI had the poutine with braised oxtail and my coworker had the beer brat sandwich. Both were excellent, but the Public House's fries are absolutely addictive.\n\nI'll be back next time I'm in town."

It's also not easy to find Dragonmilk Stout on draft. TV's at the bar show the local games. \nThe barmaid was very friendly and provided great service. She made some great recommendations for food. I wished I only listened to her. I saw Buffalo Pork Rib on the menu and knew I had to try it. It's best that we leave Buffalo sauce for chicken wings. It had an interesting flavor, but I suffered through it. \nThe brussel sprouts were excellent. At least there were three things I liked--- the brussel sprouts and the 2 Dragonsmilk Stouts."

The bar and restaurant clash with each other, especially if you happen to sit in the very first booth, which straddles the two rooms (like we did).\n\nWe had a Groupon, so we went a little hog wild, ordering drinks, apps, entrees, and a side:\n\n- Drink menu is extensive and fun. I would come here for drinks again.\n- Apps ordered were Devils on Horseback and Poutine.  The Devils on Horseback were alright, but the gravy on the poutine was just wayyyyyy tooo salty.  We couldn't even finish it.\n- I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pierogies.  While they were quite tasty, when I think about the fact they cost $27, so it's basically $9 for each one and they come with that unfortunate salty gravy, I think that's overly expensive.\n- Husband ordered the short rib, but substituted the goat cheese polenta.  Again, short rib was tasty, but was it worth $29?  Eh.  However, the polenta was delicious.\n- Bacon brussels sprouts for side.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nI would come here again for small bites/appetizers and drinks.  But not the entrees; they're just too expensive."

Buying a big name does not mean that the chef can train a chef to do the same thing in LV. That also means the staff. Oh, boy, do some of the staff in these places need to be working at McD's!!! The bartender that I had was really rude and intrusive. He made a joke about up-selling me to a prohibitively expensive version of my single malt. It was rude, inappropriate and intrusive. The food I ordered was good, but the presentation was awful. The bread was burnt. Answer, \"Some people like it like that.\" I eventually got some, but it was not put on the grill at all. What? A pate plate without a gherkin? \"Yeah, some places do that....\" Worse thing, a diner was bothering me. I carried on a conversation to be polite. She kept asking for more wine. It was obvious they didn't want to deal with her, maybe a payment thing. She called them over again and asked me to pay for her wine. The bartenders did nothing to protect me or discourage this. I know, it's Las Vegas. But this was supposed to be a better dining experience. They did put one of her drinks on my bill, even though she instructed them to give me her entire bill.  Really \"low class\".  During the heyday of old LV, the house would have bought her the drink and showed her the door."

We joined them about 2 hours later, and the four of us lingered for a while.  \n\nThe whole time, the servers were attentive - my water glass was always full, they served the food right away, they checked on us a lot. \n\nUnfortunately, for me, my Bahn Mi $15 was tasty, but a too greasy.  Sure, it's pork belly sandwich, with jalepeno peppers, and other goodies, but after a few bites, I didn't love it.  I didn't hate it, but it didn't wow me.  The fries were tastier than the sandwich. \n\nHubby's Baby Iceberg $13 and side of Chicken for $6 looked mediocre.  \nI didn't even bother asking for a bite. \n\nFriend's Lobster Roll $26.50 looked AMAZING.  She didn't offer anyone a bite, so I think THAT's what I should order next time!  She said it was just what she was looking for. \n\nFriend's hubby's Pub Burger $19 looked huge and juicy.  Side of fries. \n\nThe big draw here is the Beer... for beer fiends, you'll be very happy. They do a lot of cool beer cocktails:  Beerlini, and such.  \n\nI wish I could give it 4 stars, but for me it's all about the food and I wasn't mooning over my lunch.  But I'd come back again for that lobster roll!  That may earn another star in future."

We sat at the bar, and had Boso as our bartender. He was awesome! It was my mom's bday, so she got a free drink; she ordered a bloody. My mom likes them spicy, so the bartender made a healthy pour of a house made spicy, infused liquor for my mom's bloody. \n\nThe great service continued: I know bread is such a simple thing, but they do make really great bread here!! I don't eat bread all that often, but I liked it so much, that they brought a whole other plate, complimentary. In the end, they surprised my mom with a beautiful plate of ice cream and a candle, with \"Happy Birthday\" written nicely in chocolate syrup.\n\nThe atmosphere was really nice and tasteful, too.

Arrived on time, was told that tables were turning slowly but I was their \"first priority\" to be seated. After waiting 20 minutes and watching a party of 3 that walked in after me get seated at a huge table, I went back to the hostess stand and waited another fifteen minutes (but I'm their \"first priority\") to get seated. At a hastily set up table in the middle of a private party. In the interim I got an email from Open Table that I was a no show for my reservation...\n\nAnyway, food was good and so was our server. No complaints there. We had a fun dinner. But after the 30 minute wait to get to my table, I was hoping they would maybe give us one of our two appetizers for free for the flaw in their \"new reservation system.\" Nothing on there, so I asked the waiter what he could do and he brought a manager, who mumbled at me he was going to take something off the bill and bring it back.\n\nImagine my surprise when my second bill came back a full SEVENTY DOLLARS HIGHER then the first bill. After waving down a busser to go fetch the manager again, the manager came back and proceeded to get into a shouting match with me that there was a \"$65 per person minimum\" (not on the menu, not told to us by our server, not on a sign, nowhere to be seen) and he had added a 18% gratuity to be nice (?) and save me money (?) because I didn't have to pay the minimum? WHAT??? He then told me to \"stop yelling\" (I was certainly curt and firm, but not shouting), my coworkers got into it, and after a protracted, public debate, he finally agreed to take 20% off my tab and remove the gratuity. Which he did. But good grief, I simply wanted a little something to recognize they had screwed up my reservation, and instead I get into a public debate with a restaurant manager insistent on speaking to me like I'm a child.\n\nReally disappointing and frustrating experience. Plus, the female servers wear short shorts and low cut shirts, and the male servers wear long pants, long sleeved shirts and vests. Gross."

I'd come here again for that, and have water with it.\n\nIf you are looking for a legit beer spot in Vegas, make your way over to Aces & Ales."

Before I begin, I want to share that I'm a very easy to please restaurant patron - good food and simple yet attentive service is what I look for as would most people eating out. My boyfriend and I went there on our first night in Las Vegas. We arrived within an hour of closing and were sat by the kitchen area. My boyfriend ordered their cheeseburger and I ordered their steak. The cheeseburger was sub-standard, but edible and some god-awful basket of fries, melted cheese, pulled-meat and foie gras was all mixed in. This is supposedly their special basket of fries...my goodness. The steak was by far the worst I've ever attempted to eat. I requested it cooked medium-well and had to send it back three times as it came back pink and bleeding. The third time it came out (a new steak even) it was butter-filleted into sections, almost chopped, and it was charbroiled. Unbelievable! \n \nThe waiter we had trumped the food by far. I normally don't put waiters on blast like this, however, it is necessary here. If anyone remembers the episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardasians\" where Scott shoved $100 in that blonde waiter's mouth at Kim's birthday bash...we actually had the same guy serving us. He must have quit or gotten fired from Tao or wherever he worked in the episode. His disposition toward serving us was worse than poor. He was in a rush to leave and never asked us whether we wanted dessert. Needless to say, I left there still hungry. We were highly disappointed with the food and service and will never go back. Let this serve as a warning for anyone visiting Las Vegas."

When we got there the place looked nice and had a very large beer selection, so I was a fan.\n\nBUT.......since the vast majority of our group was there on business the check needed to be split so receipts could be turned in. There were a few couples there, so I think we needed it split 8 ways. We were told that they could only use 3 different card and that the tables could not be split. Our group was sitting at 3 four tops put together, and a long bench seat on one side. I feel like it would have been very easy to split us and still keep us all seated next to each other due to the bench seat.\n\nI understand that rules/policies are what they are and are put in place for a reason. However, I think this policy may have been put in place for smaller orders or groups, and it may have been smart for our server to check with a manager before having a group of 12 just walk out the door.\n\nUnfortunately we were forced to walk out without getting to try, what seemed to be a nice restaurant."

They roast the tomatoes,  use crisp well fried bacon, and use a great unusual bun.  They also throw in some type of cabbage and sauerkraut(?). I'm not clear on what the veggies were but it worked with a nice slice of what I think was Jack cheese.  Please go here because I'd hate if this place went out of business. \n\n My brother had the fish and he said he really liked it.   Crispy and tasty.   A bit pricey,  so by comparison the burger seems like an even better deal at a better price."

Public House is probably the first restaurant you run into once you exit the convention center so as you could expect it gets busy, FAST! I am smart so I obviously made a reservation. After pushing through the crowds of angry (idiots) that were complaining about an hour wait since they didn't have reservations (!!), we were seated promptly. \n\nThey have an awesome beer selection and the waiters are very helpful in helping you choose from the extensive list. If you eat hear you MUST get the poutine appetizer. I crave the poutine for months after I have left Vegas. It consists of fries covered in cheese curds, braised beef, and egg and is covered in a beef gravy. It's fantastic! The Pub Burger is also one of my favorites. Also good and they cook it perfectly to order! Get the side salad- the vinaigrette is shockingly good! The price isn't too much especially compared to Vega$ standards.\n\nWord of advice- MAKE A RESERVATION!!!"

That said, its done in an inventive and tasty manner, the perfect place to hit at like 2PM to soak up the hangover of last night.\n\nI ordered the blue cheese figs as well as the pork tenderloin sandwich.  The figs were solid and had some nice crispy bacon that wrapped around them - a good starter to split with a few people or to snack on while watching some TV at the bar.  The pork sandwich was divine!  Tender, slightly salty, cheesy, crispy and chewy bread, just everything you want out of a pub sandwich!  And to boot, the restaurant has an extensive beer menu!  All in definitely one of the cheaper options for a casual meal - spend the extra $2-3 per head, skip Grand Lux or the buffet, and visit Public House!"

The hostess seated us in the waiting / lounge area where we sat on leather chairs and attempted to figure out what the theme is of the restaurant  (what's up with some of the waitresses at the bar dressed up as naughty school girls?). Within 10 minutes, our hostess returned and guided us to our table. \n\nTo start, we all ordered beers. There's a decent selection of beers and wines on their alcoholic beverages menu, many of which can be purchased for waaay cheaper  at your local liquor store. Not surprised, because of course, this is The Strip. My friend's dad ordered a beer which, according to him, tasted like \"salami\". My friend and her mom took a sip and agreed; I passed on that opportunity, but I believe them. \n\nHere's what I ordered:\n\nGrilled Octopus with White Beans: Octopus, I think, can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes the meat is tough and chewy, and other times its tender. When I took a bite of my piece I was surprised to discover it was actually edible. The red sauce and white beans went well with the grilled octopus, which I wish I received more of.\n\nIrish Coffee Cheesecake: My friend and I split this along with the donut holes, but we should've each ordered our own cheesecakes, because it was delicious and I didn't think it was too sweet. I was also liking that \"hazelnut crumble\" it had.\n\nDonut Holes: Eh, these were fine, but the sauces that accompanied it (raspberry and caramel, I believe), were too sweet, especially the caramel. \n\nPublic House is OK. Service was alright, a little slow, and I thought it was unnecessary for us to wait 10 minutes even though a reservation was made in advance. Food isn't bad, but it wasn't worth the price."

We sat at the bar.\n\nModern, sexy, English, industrial looking gastropub with at least two TVs to watch the game over the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable staff (yay for Nick & Laila!).  Exquisite beer selection both on draft and in the bottle.  Straight up fun menus on freaking iPads.  Menus on iPads.  What is this, the future???\n\nThe food.  Wow.  The food.  I had fried quail and waffles on a bed of greens with lemongrass butter and Moose Drool syrup.  How you say . . . pornographically good?  My friend and I probably looked like zoo animals fighting over bites of this dish.  \n\nThe fries.  WTF?  Shredded beef.  Au jus gravy.  A fried egg.  I don't even know.  I just don't know.  My pescatarian fiance didn't even have problems sopping up the gravy.  \n\nSome sort of beet salad.  Way better than it had any right to be.  Just stop it.\n\nPotted egg.  Come on.  For real.  \n\nNot cheap, but wow."

How glad the husband is that I research things way ahead of time and knew that this was one of the few places where you could have bone marrow for lunch.\n\nWe hiked it on over here and immediately ordered the mixed flight and light flight of beers.  I traded the husband for the cider on his light flight and we ordered.  OMG, this is amazing food and service!!\n\nI got the lobster roll which was the best I have had outside of Boston - maybe even better than some places there.  Not overdone with onion, huge chunks of meat, and the buttered brioche roll held-up perfectly.  Husband had the bone marrow and a meat plate he created with the best proscuiutto and cheddar (welsh) that I have had in a long time (I did sneak a bite of each).  \n\nWe then ordered the chocolate stoute cake with BACON krispies and this was equally incredible.\n\nOur server was super friendly, helpful and made the meal one of our top of the entire trip.  I only wish they sold t-shirts because I would have bought some to remember this great meal!"

The food was consistently good and the ambiance was mellow and relaxing for a Wednesday lunch crowd.  The Lobster Mac and Cheese had large chunks of lobster and the mac was al dente.  The Lobster Roll was delicious and I added avocado (not quite ripe yet) and the bread was so buttery delicious.  The Prime Rib French Dip was tender and had lots of meat.  The Beer Brined Chicken Wings was just perfect with blue cheese chunks.  You must have beer here.  I recommend the New Holland Dragon's Milk (dark beer).  I'm returning."

It was delicious, but not as cold as the beer on tap.  Maybe it is supposed to be that way, but when its 105 degrees out, I would rather an ice cold beer.  I went to a black velvet (black stout beer and champagne or dry cider) next and was very pleased.  My wife had the Belgian beer flight.  All 4 beers were delicious (her favorite was Delirium) and healthy pours.  I had to help her finish.  She switched to a moscow mule as she used to have these in Japan, but has been unable to find the drink here in the States.  She was a happy camper.\n\nAs to the eats, we opted for the bone marrow (meh, not much marrow in the serving we received), grilled octopus (awesome, tasty and tender), potted duck rillettes (a must try), rabbit loin in porchetta (good) and bresaola (standard dried beef).  Overall, it was as expected for a gastropub.  I think it is one of the places to try if staying in the area of the Venetian/Palazzo."

We called in to make a reservation, and they said they could accommodate us at 8:30pm for a party of 8. Since they needed a credit card to hold the reservation, we held off on confirming and called back an hour later (at 1:30pm) after I spoke with the rest of the group. By then, they didn't have availability for 8:30, so we were going to go somewhere else. However, at 5pm we decided to go to Public House after all if they were able to seat us within the hour and just get ready later. They said that they could accommodate us in half an hour, so we agreed to head down shortly. We got a bit lost walking over to the Venetian, and we didn't get there until 6pm. When we go to check in at the hostess stand, she gives us a death stare and attitude about how we were supposed to be there half an hour ago, and they may not be able to seat us but she would see. She came back to say there was a table available, but it would take 10 minutes to set up, but we think she just wanted us to wait to be biatchy. And the restaurant wasn't even packed! It was full, but there were still empty tables. When we were finally seated, our server came over right away and seemed really friendly, which was a relief. We ordered:\n\n-Short Rib (Deschutes Black Butte Porter Braised, Sweet Pea Potato Puree, IPA Battered Onion Rings $29): Pretty good but not a mind-blowing dish. The short rib was really tender and the onion rings were delicious, although I think they only gave us two onion rings.\n-Pub Burger (All Natural Grass-Fed Beef, Bacon Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Roast Tomato, Frissee, Guinness Aioli w/Herbed Fries $19): Decent burger, but we asked for medium and it was barely medium rare. I wouldn't pay $19 for it again, but at least they gave us a ton of herbed fries whcih were really tasty.\n-Foie Gras (Rhubarb Compote, Almonds, Toasted Brioche $19): Good but not worth $19- it was a pretty small piece of foie gras.\n-Potted Farm Egg (Asparagus, Chaumes Fondue, Black Truffle Vinaigrette $14): Awesome deal for only $14! This dish was inventive and delicious.\n-Quail (Buttermilk Fried, Waffle, Bacon Braised Swiss Chard, Moose Drool Maple Glaze $26): I tried some of my friend's dish, and it was yummy! The waffle was nice and crisp and went well with the quail.\n-Creamed Corn & Lobster w/Bacon $10: Pretty good but really creamy. Teeny tiny pieces of lobster.\n\nThe food took a little while to come out, and we were confused since a couple of large tables left, and there were empty tables so it's not like they had a huge dinner rush. I had checked in on FourSquare and got a complimentary pint of beer. Our server accidentally brought us two, which we pointed out and he said he would just comp the second beer. Of course, we were charged for both beers on the check. We were trying to get pay quickly and get out of there since dinner took so long, but it took forever to grab our server and get the bill straightened out. I will cut him some slack because he looked super busy and was running around, but I saw one of the managers walking around in his suit and he never came by to see how we were doing and if we needed assistance, even though my friends were walking around with the bill in their hand when looking for our server. Oh well. Come try out Public House if you want to give quail and waffles a chance, but skip if you're in a hurry, and/or want some good service."

Boy were they right about that ... great beer.  I would highly recommend it as well.  Prices were up there (it is a spot in the Venetian after all), but not at LA or NYC levels.  I ordered the Pub Burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.\n\nMy Quick and Dirty review ... \n\nAtmosphere - Great (had a cigar bar feel to it (without the smoke) ... dimly lit, leather couches, big TVs, attractive waitresses, etc.)\nFood/Drinks - Fantastic (phenomenal beer selection and one of the best burgers I've ever had)\nService - Good (very attentive and helpful in recommending beers ... did I mention attractive waitresses?)\n\nSummary - If you are a beer lover, this is a must-see in Sin City.

Someone with knowledge and an eye for value is running the wine show, because the list is filled with bottles that are exciting, hard to find, and are priced right in that Vegas sweet spot of $50-$70. That's the pricing range where values tend to hide (less than that, and you're usually looking at a 4x markup for a $10 wine), and there were many to be had here.

The poutine was remarkable as well as the roasted bone marrow and devils on horseback (which were literally flavor explosions in my mouth...I know corny but true). The entrees were good. The waffle on the quail entree lacked any type of oomph. I don't know why I was expect some sort of Roscoe or southern-y goodness. However, the quail was delectable.

He said the burger was pretty tasty, and the thin sliced fries that came with it were certainly appetizing. It was my first time having Quail, so I was unsure what to expect, but it tasted pretty decent! It was breaded in a manner similar to fried chicken, and came with a waffle and what looked to be a spinach and bacon concoction. It was a fantastic dish, though I was surprised at how little meat came on the plate, but then again a quail is quite a small bird.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Chocolate Stout Layer Cake ($9). It was extremely rich, and had an interesting caramelized bacon topping on it. Even Dad tried it and thought it was delicious, and he NEVER eats desserts.\n\nThe service was excellent as well. Our server, Nikolai, was super speedy and friendly, a nice guy to gab with. The manager who helped process our Groupon was very nice as well :)\n\nThe only reason I knocked this place down a star is simply the price. It's a little too pricey for what you get, although having a Groupon certainly made the price nice. This gastropub is worth a look."

It was astonishing how poor the service was, as the place was not even busy. Having worked in the industry, it was difficult for me to leave a poor tip. But then I thought she probably does not know what a good tip looks like.

It was about 2:20 pm on Sunday. This is a long Veterans day weekend. We were offered a Hangover brunch menu which was fine. We ordered the steak and eggs dish for me and a sandwich for my husband. I also ordered some coffee, which came in a PAPER cup...!!! This was supposed to be a place that is at least one step above McDonald's, right? I was stunned, because everything else was much fancier, like nice glasses for water, atmosphere and all.. I didn't want to sound difficult or anything, I just wanted a regular coffee cup, but when Iasked for it i was told they had them put away... ???!! I also had no spoons or other utensils on our table, and even after the paper coffee cup was brought noone thought of bringing me a spoon... Had to ask another waiter for it... And even when he finally brought the spoon it never crossed their mind to bring us forks and knives to eat with... Basically, we had to ask for every little thing to make us eat comfortably...The dish took about half an hour to get to our table, and of course, the steak was burnt... At that point we were just so hungry and tired of waiting, that all I wanted was to eat and get out of there..I am not even mentioning the fact that when my husband said he didn't eat pork the waitress didn't offer to substitute it with chicken or something, and ended up charging the same price for a meatless version of his dish.. Needless to say that on a 30 something dollar bill we gave only a $2 tip for the terrible service and food we got. I hope they read this and improve, otherwise they would lose all the customers- there are plenty of places around to eat in Vegas!"

We only ended up having to pay tax and tip, so this entire meal cost us about $20. I can easily say this was the best $20 meal I've ever had, especially since a 20 spot doesn't get you much in Vegas. Our original bill was approximately $100, so had we not had the voucher, we probably would haven't ordered all of these items.\n\nAppetizers\n-Cheesesteak spring roll - LOVED and for sure my favorite part of the meal! I'm a huge sandwich lover, and this was a great new take on one of my favorite classic sandwiches. I would agree with other reviews in that it's more of an egg roll than a spring roll. Wish there was a different sauce. The ketchup didn't add anything to it in my opinion.\n-Buffalo Shrimp: humongous pieces of shrimp in buffalo sauce. Pretty good, but of the two appetizers, I preferred the cheesesteak.\n\nEntrees: \n-Filet mignon sliders. I went with the reviews and ordered them. In my opinion, they were over hyped and only decent. I didn't find them to be worth the $25 price tag had I been paying full price.\n-Beer braised short ribs. These were the winner, winner, chicken dinner! So incredibly delicious and tender. They melted in your mouth\n\nDrinks:\n-Great beer list, with plenty of choices. Don't remember which one my other half ordered but he liked it.\n-Berry Good Lemonade - Stoli blueberry, cranberry and lemonade. Got me feeling reaaaal good.\n\nOur waitress was fantastic. I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a nice shout-out. Sometimes you feel really awkward handing them this piece of paper that screams \"I'm a cheap scumbag\" but she didn't treat us any different and was fabulous. I would come back here next time we're in town, but we wouldn't probably eat as much. It was great to get to try a little bit of everything though."

Unfortunately, she was sick and had to cancel, but we stayed the course and went there as planned.\n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess said she had a half booth/half table available for us, despite the fact that there were about 4-5 open booths in sight. I mentioned this, and she said that the server in that section was overwhelmed, and that she didn't want us to have a poor experience. Okay, so kudos to her for being honest; shame on management for being so poorly staffed on a Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas. Reluctantly we did the half table.\n\nWe sat there for literally 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. Finally, it was the same hostess that came and poured some water for us, saying someone would be right out.\n\nThat should have been our exit right then and there. But, we stayed.\n\nOur waitress was nice, but she called me \"sweetheart\" as soon as she came to the table. Now, I wouldn't take notice usually IF the waitress were older than me, or I was in the South. However, she was young, and Vegas is definitely not the South; it really rubbed me weird. Other than that, she was friendly and took our orders: Steak & Eggs special, for $15 each.\n\nAfter ordering, we waited. And waited. And waited. The food took forever to come out, with the waitress showing up only once to say that the orders were almost ready. No \"Can I get you anything while you wait?\" or anything. Meh.\n\nWe ordered our steaks medium rare. When the plates came, mine was brown all the way through and my girlfriend's was barely pink. We opted just to eat and get the hell out, because the meal was going to be comped off of our account anyway by the M Life folks. However, the food was SO bland and tasteless, we were really put off.\n\nMy girlfriend ate maybe 1/3 of her food and I about 2/3 (the hash browns and scrambled eggs were okay). At that point, we were done. Our waitress never came over to ask how everything was once. Finally, she came and without asking, simply picked up our plates.\n\nHere's the thing - if you were a server in a restaurant and one of your guests barely ate anything on her plate, wouldn't you be trained or even INCLINED to ask if there was a problem with the food? Not even a little bit? Nope; nada. She just picked up the plates and left.\n\nIn the end, I asked to speak to the manager. It was a young guy, and when he asked what was wrong, I wasn't an ass about it, but I told him I couldn't remember a worse meal in recent memory in Las Vegas. He asked what specifically was wrong, and I told him whoever was in the kitchen didn't deserve to be working there - that we could have gone to McDonald's in the food court and had tastier food. I then explained that I'd ordered my steak medium rare and it was as pink as the sole on my Doc Martin. He said he wished we'd told him sooner, and then I mentioned that would be impossible since we hadn't seen our waitress the entire time we had our food except for when she came to collect the plates. I told him his staff was not good, nor were they intuitive to guests' needs at all - or they simply are use to this and don't care anymore.\n\nThe manager was apologietic and asked us to give them another chance during our weekend, and I explained that honestly, in Vegas, where there are SO many GOOD choices of exciting restaurants that there was virtually no margin for this type of horrible service. I was frank, and told him we wouldn't be coming back. At that point, he took the check, said he'd take care of it and walked away; it was obvious that he'd dismissed us and that it was over.\n\nRegardless of whether a meal is going to be comped or not - and there is no way for a kitchen staff to know anyway - NO restaurant in Vegas should be content with this, and no management team should be okay with it. Shame on Luxor too, for not being aware that this is happening in one of their prime food locations.\n\nI'd avoid Public House at Luxor completely; you can do much, much better than to waste a Vegas meal opportunity here."

Later, I would realize there was no way I would have a second drink and my BF decided to order an Innis and Gunn.\n\nThe food was delicious and portions were generous, the waiter used both top priced drinks as the 2 for 1 (Bloody Mary $13 and the Innis & Gunn $13) which was appreciated, most restaurants would have comped the cheapest (Sam Adams). Overall, I really liked this place as an option for a more casual evening at the Luxor!\n\nOh, they also offer free wi-fi, and in fact, this is one of the only places I have found wi-fi in the Luxor (rooms only offer wired access)."

However, the 3 tacos were very wet from the rib meat, the sriracha squiggles were a joke, and came with guacamole and rancid pico de gallo. We mentioned the pico de gallo to our server and were only told that it had come in that morning. Overall, it was disappointing. $13.00.\n\nPublic house burger with well seasoned fries. We ordered medium well but the burger patty was still pink inside but somehow dry, topped with cheese and caramelized onions on a brioche bun. It was okay.  $15.00.\n\nService = friendly but spotty. We ended up snagging silverware and napkins from a nearby table when the soup came out. \n\nPrices = moderate. $34.60 for dinner. And we only truly enjoyed the soup.\n\nNote: Plenty of TV screens, full bar with bar seating, and the Pittsburgh-Cincinnati game was wild, which made everyone in the place hoot and holler. Seems like a good place to be for games, brew and bar bites."

We were finally seated and our server was extremely attentive. We ordered some cocktails to start. I ordered the Sin City Sunrise and my fella ordered the pineapple martini. Both were pretty tasty. We started with the shortrib nachos and buffalo shrimp appetizers. They came out quickly and they were both had nice flavor. My favorite were the buffalo shrimp. They had a nice kick and the bleu cheese was flavorful. For $16 you only get four small fried shrimp, though. The nachos were nice. We both enjoyed the shortrib, but I disliked the queso dip. It had a weird texture, a little clumpy and it didn't have enough cheesy flavor for me. The potato chips were a nice touch. \n\nFor entrees, I went with the filet mignon sliders and my fella got the steak frites. The sliders were great. They had full pieces of filet on a slider and they were pretty well-cooked. The meat was a little tough, but still had a nice flavor. The steak frites were disgusting. The meat texture was really grainy and the sauce that it was served with had the worst flavor. We kind of just pushed this dish to the side and shared my sliders since we already had so much food. \n\nOverall, we had a nice meal and I would be happy to try this place again with another coupon or maybe for Happy Hour. Otherwise, it's a good place to check out if you're staying at the hotel or in the area, but don't go out of your way to try this place."

Public House is OK but fails to hit the stratospheric mark set by others.\n\nNote: This review is for the Midwest chain \"Public House \" at Luxor NOT the stand alone at the Venetian.  \n\nTo the core of the gastropub, the beer.  Weak selection with less than 20 on tap, 20 in bottles.  Very few unique microbrews or craft beers.  PBR and the werewolf killer reign supreme.\n\nThe food; aggressive flavors, lots of fatty, fried goodness, just lacking wow factor.   The best sellers: \n\nSpicy braised short rib tacos.  Spicy, flavorful, braised then shredded short ribs with siracha and greens served with a side of creamy guacamole and salsa.  Delicious but very wet from excessive braising liquid in the taco.\n\nCheese steak spring roll (steak, chipotle peppers, jalapeno jack cheese all rolled up in a crispy spring roll skin and deep fried golden brown) gooey goodness but one dimensional even with the house made spicy ketchup.\n\nBuffalo shrimp (breaded, deep fried jumbo shrimp with a bleu cheese and buffalo hot sauce) definitely good eats.  Over cooked and rubbery but somehow welcomed as pub grub.  \n\nFilet mignon sliders.  Nice.  Thick cut pieces of medium well filet topped with deeply caramelized onions and bleu cheese in a sweet but somewhat dry Maui onion brioche.  A-OK.\n\nA great place to catch a game.  Fun and friendly service.  Lots of promotions and a great happy hour.  Foodies may want to look elsewhere for a great gastropub experience."

It looked like a a little wooden paddle. The breading was thick, greasy and dry at the same time. Kind of a weird sensation in your mouth trying to figure out if you are eating fish or if the grease has just congealed into a disgusting blob. \nThe rest really wasn't much better. I mean the kids had burgers. How hard is it to make a burger? It must be very hard because the burgers here were like some cafeteria bs. \nThat's pretty much it.

I wanted to be seated in the regular dining area though and asked if there was a difference between the options at the bar and in the dining area and the hostess said no. So we waited to be seated and he takes us to the bar area in the dining area and seats us there. I wanted an actual table and a server and was not there to drink. When we asked the host he said that they had already put to many people at the tables. Basically left us no choice but to sit there. Also he gave us the late night menu which is a hugely condensed menu and that didnt start until 11 and it was not yet 11 but again made us feel like this was our only option. I ordered with the bartender who was very nice and he even let us order off the regular menu because like i had mentioned it was not yet 11pm. Eventually I got fed up with sitting at the bar and asked if we could sit at a regular table and they obliged but weren't happy about it. We ordered fried mac and cheese, surf and turf burger, and a bacon burger. All sounded way better than they actually tasted. The concept was there but the execution of the food was not great. Everything was dry and just was not great. And for the price was not worth it. I would highly recommend to only go here if ur ok spending lots of money on food that should be way cheaper. I say do your research and eat or try somewhere else. This place had high hopes from me but it was highly dissapointing."

My wife loved this and I know we'll be back just for this dish.  I also got the cheesesteak egg rolls after inhaling multiple pieces of these after Misti's CMYE: Bodies event.  They were outstanding and as good as I remember although $3 a piece seemed kind of high.\n\nFilet mignon sliders ($25) were really good.  We both expected just \"ground filet mignon\" but those babies were just straight pieces of tender, juicy filet nestled in between some tasty buns.  I was surprised how good the steak was for being much smaller than your average filet.  \n\nLast and definitely least was the \"French Quarter Jambalaya\".  It was a boring sauce with dry chicken breast with the shrimp being the highlight.  I think a real Cajun/Creole place serving jambalaya would try this and break out in sheer laughter.  \n\nI got the Goose Island Nero Belgium Ale ($12) which had to be north of 9% because I was feeling it after one.  My wife ordered the pomegranate martini ($13) which she said was fine.  \n\nWe got a $100 dinner for $49 before gratuity and this was certainly not a dinner worth that price. I would stop by for happy hour and just do appetizers and drinks.  Our server was very friendly and helpful."

We noticed this restaurant on our way to our room and saw there was a free drink coupon in the coupon book we got when we checked in.  We had a cocktail, the rum punch, which was really good and definitely the highlight of our meal.  He ordered the chicken wings, which was a really big serving and I had the Cobb salad.  The salad was pretty standard ... but how hard it is it to screw up a salad?  His chicken wings tasted like an Asian spice flavored wing rather than a buffalo wing. It was ok.  The ranch sauce tasted like it was spoiled, so we left it pretty much as we got it.  Overall, the food was average at best., but the drinks were really well made.  The service was OK, but it took way too long for our food to come out.  The decor is nice and there were a ton of TVs in there so you could catch any sports game picked up by satellite.

Unfortunately they had changed their hours and we had come a little to late. Bummed, we started to work our way to the food court when we happened to spot the Public House. The menu was on display outside and we immediately agreed to eat here instead. \n\nIt is a very open restaurant with big screen TVs covering the walls. Our server Rian was amazing! She greeted us immediately got our drinks and started our appetizer (Mac n' Cheese squares!) The fried Mac n' Cheese squares came 5(?) to a plate (I cant remember they were basically gone the second they were put on our table) They came with a buffalo wing sauce and a chipotle ranch sauce. Entrees followed soon after.\n\nI had the turkey burger, with guacamole, smoke gouda, on an onion bun. I opted to substitute my fries for a healthier side salad, My boyfriend had the angus burger with the fries. Everything was simply amazing. My boyfriend complained about his onions (not regular raw onions but a sauteed onion placed under the cheese) I do not hold this against the restaurant because our server had asked if everything on the burger was ok for him, he said yes. I did steal a few fries off my boyfriends plate and they were perfectly cooked in my opinion, extra crunch on the outside without getting the overcooked feel. (definitely the best french fry i had the entire trip)\n\nWhen we went this restaurant was only opened for 15 days, I wish this restaurant the best and I hope I get the chance to eat here again. We couldn't stop raving about the food/service the rest of our trip!"

            "review": "How often do two different restaurants open with the same name in the same city? I guess this is a stupid question because I really don't care about the answer, but it surely creates some confusion. This recently happened with the opening of Public House at the Luxor. Somehow sharing the same name as the expensive but superior Public House at the Venetian, the one at the Luxor opened with minimal fanfare a couple weeks ago. Does it hold up as well as the fancy Gastropub down the street?\n\nPublic House at the Luxor has a decent but somewhat generic Stations-feeling interior to it; it's very open and clean, but not really as stylized or fun as it could be. It features a few pipes tied back to the beer kegs similar to what you would find at a place like Yardhouse or even the unrelated restaurant of the same name at the Venetian, but they're not quite as impactful. There's a darker, more intimate and inviting bar area as well as a large open dining area. The General Manager came to my table to greet me before my food came out, and mentioned that the official opening of the restaurant was later that night. An early opportunity such as this is exciting, but kind of leaves the venue open to a revisit if the meal is less than ideal so early on.\n\nThe menu isn't available yet on their website, or much else for that matter, but their Luxor page mentions 'upscale American Fare'. I didn't really pay attention to anything other than their burger: half pound angus burger, brioche with a choice of a cheese and a topping including mushrooms, saut\u00e9ed onions, fried onions and the like. What came out didn't look too impressive, but the meat had great flavor upon first bite and was cooked more to medium than the medium rare I had ordered. The brioche bun was buttery and good, and the mushrooms had good flavor. The cheese was melted well and coated my entire patty. Speaking of the patty, it seemed hand-formed as it wasn't close to being a perfect circle and had a pretty weird shape to it. Even if it actually isn't hand-formed, the illusion is always welcome. Overall the burger was a bit messy, but this is a somewhat negative connotation that I don't want to apply to this burger as a formed standard looking burger every time gets dull, and the irregular look is a bit refreshing.\n\nThe fries sucked; they had little flavor and weren't really hot. They got very hard by the end and had a kind of odd unwelcome texture to them. The best part about them was definitely the chipotle ketchup which wasn't an option given to me by my waiter when asked if I wanted ketchup, but by the person that brought my food out later on with no ketchup in hand.\n\nThe burger comes with kettle chips or salad for $12, which isn't too bad of a price for a restaurant directly in a casino, but I hate the fact that I have to pay an extra $3 to get fries instead. That, combined with my iced tea brought my meal to $18.75 very quickly, which is a bit much for what you get. I suppose I could start drinking water and cutting out easily $3-4 with every meal, but I'm sure most visitors to these locations would probably order a beer or something more expensive so it doesn't matter much. The additional money for fries annoys me, but if you're looking for a burger and don't want to leave the Luxor this isn't too bad. If you're willing to walk a couple minutes and spend a few dollars more, Burger Bar is by far the better choice."

As for the prices...I'd say considerably overpriced - $10 for a Guinness draft...really?  I know it's the strip...but we're at the Luxor people, not Bellagio.  A good beer bar should always err on the side of reasonable pricing, because people will absolutely have that 1 or 2 extra if they don't have to cringe a bit for every pint.\n\nWe ordered wings and sliders - the prices were a bit bloated here as well, but consistent with any other strip sports bar.  The wings were actually very good, as were the sliders, so no cringing there.  My girlfriend had the steak salad, which was also very good - just be sure to get the dressing on the side, it's loaded with blue cheese and dressing, which can weigh the whole thing down.\n\nWhat really stuck out was our bartender, Jamie.

But the food was definitely a step up from what you might expect given the laid back atmosphere.\n\nAll in all I would say if you want good food and you're nearby, definitely give it a shot."

I ordered a turkey burger which was very good. My sister had the fish and chips which was way overcooked, I'm glad I didn't order it. It was not busy when we were seated and the waiter said he would be right back. A family, (mom, dad and two kids) was seated after us and he took their order first! My sister and I were not happy with that at all. It's really too bad that in the year 2016, that two middle aged women cannot get good service without being accompanied by a man. The management needs to be more hip to the times."

Yes, please!\n\nWe sat down and waited 5 minutes but there was only a bartender for the entire bar, bar tables and lounge area.  I went to the bar to get the menu and the bartender apologized but said there was a waitress for that area.   We chose what we wanted and there was still no sight of our waitress, so my Hubs went to the bar to order.  In that time, our waitress came back to the lounge area.  My Hubs had been standing in line at the bar for 10 minutes before he got to the front of the line.  When the bartender saw she had returned, he sent him away instead of just entering the order.  After our waitress took our order, the drinks arrived 13 minutes after and the food another 10 minutes after that.  Yes, I was so agitated at this time that I had started a draft review.  Everyone who was there had drinks and there was only 2 other couples waiting to place their drinks.  I'm pretty steamed at this time, BUT they could have redeemed themselves on the food!\n\nWe got the mac and cheese squares that everyone had raved about, the philly spring rolls and the kettle chip nachos.  The kettle chip nachos could easily have fed a good 4 people.  I liked the crunch of the chips and the cheese sauce but the short ribs on the nachos were not that great.  I can't place my finger on if it wasn't salted enough but I'll give it to them...the meat was very tender.  The philly spring rolls were meaty, cheesy and crunchy.  Those were definitely my top choice in the 3 we ordered.  The mac and cheese looked great, had a amazing breaded crunch but failed in taste.  My Hubs described it as \"deep fried butter noodles,\" which is spot on.  There was no oozy cheese sauce or cheese flavor at all.  I ate half a square and did not finish the rest.  We ended up leaving most of that dish behind. \n\nMight be back for the nachos & spring rolls if we are gambling in this casino again but I would definitely not purposely come here to eat.  In the time we were there, we saw another group sit, wait and then give up and leave.  If you must, I would advise you to sit at the bar...the bartender was a pretty fast fellow and he owned his part of the bar."

We both ordered a Public Burger with Homemade Kettle Chips. \nWithin no time, our burgers were sitting in front of us. The burgers looked amazing. The burger tasted like it looked amazing. The bun was toasted just right, not over toasted not under toasted. The veggies were crispy and fresh. The meat cooked just right. I asked for it medium and I go it medium. It had great flavors and was perfect. I ate the homemade Kettle Chips last since they are usually my favorite. I was kind of afraid that they would be soggy, but they were not. They were still crispy. and tasted super good, with the right amount of salt and pepper on them. I couldn't get enough of them, so I ate half of my wife's.

The main screen could use an update, but honestly, we could see the game from multiple angles and that is really what matters. Due to living outside of Washington, we have to stream half the games anyways. \n\nSince we had a big dinner planned a few hours after the game, we shared an order of the nachos and had a few 22 ounce beers.  The tap selection was pretty basic and a bit overpriced. \n\nService was slow, but that didn't matter all that much as we had plenty of time to kill. \n\nThe kettle nachos were pretty good for bar fare. They were smothered with a fondue style gooey cheese and slow cooked beef. Good enough to hold us over until dinner. \n\nWe will probably catch the game elsewhere next time we are in town, but if you are staying at the Luxor and don't want to travel far to get your football fix, Public House is right there waiting for you with plenty of familiar 12th man fans."

The steak that we asked as medium rare was more like well done. My bf's steak was completely brown, while mine was SLIGHTLY pink.

We asked the server to bring everything out at once or as soon as the food is ready. \n\nWe ordered Kettle Chip Nachos, 6 pc traditional wings, Cubano Sandwich, Steak Salad and Pastrami Sandwich. We received the Kettle Chip Nachos and Wings by 6:15pm.

Server said it was coming out soon, our food was coming up next. \n\n6:40pm.... 6:45pm rolls around we asked for a manager and gave Charles my card to pay the bill. Her name was Patricia, but nowhere to be found. We had two bartenders and our server get her. They all said she would be stopping by. 6:50pm rolls around, food comes out but we didn't not feel that we should be rushed to eat so we sent the food back and signed the check. \n\nManager was still nowhere to be found. I previously checked out the Yelp Reviews, it looked like the primary customer complaint was regarding customer service, but still wanted to give this place a try.... Typical of big corporate companies, management doesn't care about customers. To MGM Food & Beverage management and directors.... someone is to blame for carelessness, Patricia didn't want to own up to what happened. \n\nLastly, by the time we walked up the escalators to see the show, we were stopped by our server, as he had given us another customers credit card. \n\nI just checked my bank statement, I should've only been card for the Kettle Chip Nachos and Wings, but was charged the full $81.11. This is NOT what I signed for~ \n\nI see that from other Yelp reviews that MGM Guest Relations responds to all the reviews. However with what was demonstrated to us today, you have to wonder.... is this just another automated response? The concerns that are expressed and replies does not reflect the management and customer service that was shown to us tonight. Another thought which may be blatant but true... you confirmed to me that each customer that comes through your doors are probably nothing but a number. Complaints aren't taken seriously because you believe that another customer will always be there to fill a hotel room or a dining table.... but consider the number of people collectively over time that may not come back because of your lack of due diligence."

I stayed couple of times at Luxor and trying to find a place to eat it's always a hassle. I go back in forth between trying a casino buffet or eating at a regular restaurant. Since I'm not a fan of buffets we ended trying this place and boy did I LOVE IT!!! The service was great and the food was just amazing. I had burger with fries as well as an order of Cajun wings and the food tasted delicious. It was fresh, cooked right and full of flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone that is staying at the Luxor or just simply passing by, you won't regret it."

It took an hour to get our food and the place was only half full. We had to remind the server about our drink orders. After a while, we realized it was faster to go to the bar to get another drink. Somehow, even half full, the place was really loud. The food was ok. I'm not one to complain about expensive food on the Strip, because that's just how it's going to be, but I'd rather have food that's at least tasty, and not just ok.  The Public House at the Venetian is much better -- a little classier but even more expensive."

Of the 20 that we considered, the Public House was BY FAR the best and perfect choice!  The friendly staff was understanding, seating very comfortable, and food, while not amazing, was perfect for the situation. The fact that our team won in overtime was a major plus as well!  We HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Public House as the #1 smoke-free game-watching location on the Las Vegas Strip!"

            "review": "This seems like another episode of places in Las Vegas sharing names with other places in Las Vegas, which really seems to confuse the Maps App thing on iPhones...anyway, that aside, this one is right off the casino floor in Luxor, so if you're into people watching for weirdos while you get your drank on, this is a pretty good spot for that. You probably will have to get your own drinks, though, depending on where you're sitting. If you like playing the sports books, this would also be a good place to catch whatever game you're betting on and watch your fortunes wax and/or wane, as the case may be. Given that it is in that proximity to the floor, you could also go throw some coins in a machine during breaks after hitting the head as well. The best/worst part of being on the casino floor is saving on cigarettes while still getting that wonderful odor permeating your clothes and it's FREE! Also, it gets loud as Hell between that and the overheads, but loud is par the course in Vegas.\n\nService staff seemed mostly friendly, but a bit brusque and short (maybe they were mad because they all had to wear matching uniform sports jerseys). I get it; I couldn't do that gig, either, but the big difference is that I wouldn't attempt it. This sort of place, despite the curious art prints on the walls, is really going for sort of a sports pub/party thing and having a bunch of staff dragging down the mood is a bit of a sour note. Food is about on par with a sports bar, so if that's your thing, you're set here."

My kids ordered penne noodles with butter. Now, noodles are pretty easy to make, but apparently not for Public House. They looked and tasted like they had been cooked 5 hours prior, and then sat baking under a heat lamp all night. The noodles were actually CRUNCHY. :-(  We sent them back, and the replacements were EXACTLY the same. My fish was as dry as the Sahara, and if I weren't so starving, I would have sent it back too (not that I would have expected an improvement.) My husband's shrimp dish was also horrible, and sat in his stomach like a big boulder. We would have walked out, but the only redeeming feature of our experience, was that the waitress was very nice, and attentive, so we stuck it out - for HER. However, our food was so inedible that when we left there, we went straight to another restaurant to eat a \"do-over\" meal. We are locals, and have eaten at many fabulous restaurants in town. And with all of the fantastic cuisine available here, we would never in a million years choose to go to Public House again."

But it didn't really make a difference in the level of satisfaction. Also there was no restroom in the restaurant.

Had the filet mignon sliders with fries, the meat was nice and tender. The onions were enough to add a nice taste without over powering the whole slider. Food is nothing special but is solid. My husband ordered a Cuban sandwich and got it 30 minutes after I did. The manager comped his beer, that was nice. FYI, we didn't make a fuss about the tardiness at all.\n\n+ big screens\n+wait staff is polite and professional\n+food is solid\n-late with order\n+no charge on drinks"

The reason we came in was for the screaming deal of a rack of ribs with a bucket of beer for 30 bucks. The deal was great, but the ribs were so-so. Not a bad place to hang out and rest your feet though."

We looked over the menu and with Monique's assistance, selected the Buffalo Shrimp for both of us.  It was a great choice and really tasty, as were our libations.  As for Monique, she was bubbly, talkative and a wealth of information on the menu selections.  We had a great time!  Thanks Monique and Public House."

It's Vegas and we understand the $$ so no offense to this place.\n\nWe all decided to order some of their signature items and they were very very tasty.\n\n1) short rib tacos (3)- it's an appetizer but can be an entree. The tacos are large and in charge. The meat is braised in beer and is super tender. Topped with siriacha and a slaw on the bottom. Order the siriacha on the side that way you have more. \n\n2) kettle chip nachos- appetizer that can totally be shared. We are talking crispy chips smothered in white cheese sauce and topped with the same braised short rib. So so tasty!\n\n3) filet mignon sliders (3)- thick filets of tender beef, caramelized onions, and blue cheese. I ordered a side of salad instead or fries because I needed to add some freshness. Again, great!\n\nThe staff was very friendly. If I was too lazy to come out of my hotel to eat, I would orders these items again!"

            "review": "$90 for an undrinkable cocktail, raw potatoes, two wedge salads with close to no dressing or toppings that were upside down for the sake of presentation(at a sports bar, are you serious?), an overly fatty rib eye which was at least cooked close to my specifications(I asked for rare and got medium-rare), and a bowl of chicken and corn chowder, which I was told was actually good, so at least there is that. Server was gone for long periods of time, including the time between taking our drink orders and us actually getting those drinks and having a chance to order, and the time after we ordered and received our food, while other server's customers were eating, who had shown up after we ordered. So yeah, that was my experience. If you want a bowl of chicken and corn chowder, don't mind possibly having to wait for quite a while, and are fine with ordering a beer, since I'm pretty sure all the bartenders here know how to do is poor beers, then this is the place for you.\n\nBoth me and my partner had to flip our salads upside-down, order more bleu cheese dressing, and even then there were literally only two cherry tomatoes which was enough for four bites since they were cut in half,  and only enough bacon for a few bites, which was the quality of Bacos,  and probably actually was Bacos.\n\nSeriously though, how do you serve raw fingerling potatoes? It takes like no time to cook them! They are the easiest potatoes in the world to cook!"

It was super tasty but definitely should have gotten the dressing on the side because it was so thin and fell out the bottom of the wrap as I was eating it. Someone else at our table had kettle ships and they were amazing.  I don't know if they make them there but they were the best ever.  The fries I got were k, but I opted for my table mate's chips instead. They have lots of tvs, one huge wall of tvs which I think would be so much fun for football."

Well, another fail by another strip \"chain.\"  Got seated, waited forever for service, and then we seemed to confuse the server by asking about the football specials.  He didn't know what they were and had to go find a \"football menu.\"  After coming back with just the food specials, we asked if there were beer specials.  He didn't know, but he thought that there might be some specials.  He again left to find that menu.  After he dropped it of and said that he would be back to take our order (no chance we could order a beer right then) we decided to leave...not worth the effort and we could go spend $20 at Shake Shack and be much happier.  Won't be back, sorry."
