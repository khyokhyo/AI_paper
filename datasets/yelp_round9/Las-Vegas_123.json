So of course, we jumped on Yelp in search for a good breakfast place :)\n\nFinally we founds The Cracked Egg on Yelp. I was super excited because breakfast is my favorite meal of the day! \n\nThe Grub.\n[[ CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT $10.25 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2#_JzB5Wo5TQvPGwzEXxZZ4w This Benedict comes on a grilled English muffin, Canadian bacon and two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce! \n[[ COUNTRY BENEDICT $11.40 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2#k7ucRnegPlLeKZ6F1iDl3g The Benedict comes on a biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs and smothered in gravy!\n[[ HAM & CHEESE OMELET $9.35 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2#V_EOo-gE_LcPEzn-Y4Rbbw This omelet is simple and delish! \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to others."

I didn't really see any huge portions from what I saw coming out of the kitchen. I had the basic cakes & eggs with sausage link. The best part of it was the link. Honestly Denny's would've been a better choice but there isn't one in my area. I'll come back ONLY if I can't make my own breakfast."

Normally I order the Greek omelet, but this time I got the Tropical French toast.  It was yummy!  Others  ordered French toast, multigrain pancakes, and a skillet.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The service was not the best but the place was crowded on a Thursday morning at 9 AM so that is understandable."

(Okay parents, just sensor me.  I don't write for kids.  Just have your kids read Dr. Seus' Green Eggs and Ham.)  This crack house is extremely addictive.   I don't even know where to begin.  These house potatoes are so delicious.  It's size, seasoning and crispy is just yummieee.   My favorite dish is the eggs benny.  The balance and quality of the ingredients creates such a perfect harmony.  Another favorite thing here is the coffee cake.  It's a different cake all time.  It's fresh, piping hot and intoxicating!  To bad most men aren't like that.  - Uh, did I go off topic again? -M2"

The staff is very friendly and attentive, they have a huge selection of delicious good quality food and their prices are good. I ordered the cakes and egg combo it comes with pancakes, 2 eggs any style I got scrambled with cheese and also your choice of bacon or sausage I got sausage. Now I know it sounds basic but it was probably the best pancakes and sausage I have ever had from a restaurant the pancakes were fluffy goodness and the sauce was nice and juicy I ate every bite of my plate which is rare for me. \n\nMy bf got the chicken fried steak which he devoured in a blink of an eye luckily i grabbed a bite before he finished it off and that too was also delicious ill be getting that next time we go here. \n\nThis place is a winner for sure!"

            "review": "I work in the area and despite my mediocre rating, I frequent this location and have quite a few positive things to say about it. The big one is there's a 9 out of 10 chance that you will have exceptional service. The wait staff has been here for ages. I've been in the area 5 years and it's almost the same staff as when I first came in. They are pretty much on top of everything - they're attentive to when you are sat, if your drinks are running low, and they always make sure you have the check before you ask for it. Plus if you're a regular, they have down too.\n\n While their omelettes and scrambles are quite good, I usually come here around lunch time so I'm not feeling eggy. My usual at this location is the soup (Tortilla Soup is the house soup Monday- Thursday) and half sandwich (BLT for me please). I've tried other items on the menu but each time, I wish I just stuck with my usual. Their sandwiches are bland and uneventful. Their idea of ciabatta bread is my definition of a hamburger bun...their wraps are not missing some punch.\n\nMy biggest gripe is paying the check. The cashier\\hostess stand is not an efficient set up for people coming in or wanting to get out. It's doubly worse when the cashier and the hostess are the same lady. It can get backed up pretty quickly. It stinks when you have to wait awhile to be seated for no good reason, and then have to wait even longer to pay your tab.\n\nAll in all it's nothing spectacular. There are plenty of other places in the area with more personality BUT there's nothing terrible about it - it's just a-okay."

But after awhile the lady noticed we were getting restless so she sat us down in 2 separate tables but right next to each other which worked out great. Everything we had was brought out quick and super delicious! I had the country fried steak which was cooked to perfection and my boyfriend had the monte cristo which was also amazing! Our waitress was even kind enough to split the bill for us."

The one complaint this time is that I ordered the corn beef hash breakfast and was disappointed that it had very little corn beef in it, like 25% beef and 75% potato. My suggestion, skip the corn beef hash breakfast."

            "review": "NOT much of breakfast eater but my cousin from Sac in town and decided too meet up with my brother and my nieces at their favorite breakfast joint. I have been too few times just never got around too reviewing it. One thing really like about The Cracked Egg location so close too the house plus if this one busy then go five min down the road too there free standing restaurant. (I never been). It kind of small place so depending when you go there chance wait. We all meet up on weekend and good thing went early because by 10am the place was insane and line out the door. Go early or late breakfast/lunch crowds not your thing. \n\nThe Coffee Cake the bomb. I went with chili cheese omelette. It was really good! It had right portion of chili and cheese. The seasoned potatoes without doubt MY FAVORITE things on the menu. Sure you seasoned potatoes at any breakfast joint but the thing stands out for me is the seasoning mix they put on them. I have no idea it is. All I know is potatoes are addicting could eat plate of potatoes be in complete bliss. I put some ketchup on them but really tasty eat them by themselves. They nice HOT. Crispy on the outside. I also had the sandwiches on the menu are solid and makes for great breakfast/lunch. One thing after spoiling myself with Red Velvet Pancakes at BabyStack wish they had some too. It one type of pancakes they don;t have but have other yummy options comes too pancakes. Everything on the menu is solid had few things on the menu and loved it!\n\nThe service had always been great! Even when its super busy the service always been great, staff if very friendly, and great way too start the day with meal at The Cracked Egg. =))"

Our server was one of the sweetest.. the type of girl who will brighten your morning without over doing it. She was more than helpful, again, without overdoing it. Wish I remembered her name.. brunette with a pixie haircut and i think she had a small tat on the back of her neck.. tiny frame, sweet eyes & smile. Sorry .. girl crushing for a split sec there. Anyway, we went on a Sunday and the wait was long of course but it was worth it. Love the booth seating and the service overall was perfect, especially on such a busy morning. Oh and our meal was delicious. I had the Veggie Benny and hubby had Buttermilk Pancakes, scrambled eggs and an order of bacon & sausage. Omg soo good."

Flavorful moist tender meat. in between a hot soft bun. I also had the eggs Benedict. Nice presentation. The Hollandaise sauce was alright. It seems generic to me. It taste like it came  from  a jar. The fries and hash browns are a definite 5 star. Service was blazing fast and super friendly. I like this place :-)"

The flavors are always different and the highlight of my meal is finding out which one I'll have that day.  I've loved all the meals I've ever had here.  And the seasoned potatoes are a total guilty pleasure.  \n\nThe prices can't be beat.  We always get a buy one get one coupon in the View newspaper.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg is such a no-brainer for breakfast (even at lunchtime, which I do often!)."

            "review": "Where do I even start? This place is home for me. The very first time I visited The Cracked Egg (their original location in the NW), I was in high school. Even with my vast change in taste (all around, but mostly food-wise) in the last decade, this is still my benchmark for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.\n\nOne thing that is consistent is my love for their Coffee Cake. It's a slice of fluffy goodness. Not to mention keeping you on your toes with unprecedented flavors! I ALWAYS order it with my breakfast. I've tried about ten of their flavors, but my favorites remain the pumpkin (obviously offered during Autumn) and the peanut butter (totally unexpected and simply amazing!). My goal has been to try all the flavors, so I get pretty excited when it's something I haven't had before. It's also the very first thing I ask the server, \"What flavor is the coffee cake today?\"\n\nWhat I normally order for breakfast is the polish sausage, two sunny side-up eggs, and seasoned potatoes. The polish sausage is scrumptious, the eggs and potatoes are always cooked perfectly, and I love putting some Tabasco on my egg yolks, then dipping the potatoes in. YUM. Also, definitely some of the best \"breakfast\" potatoes! If I want to be healthy, I order The Garden Patch omelette that has fresh vegetables, made with egg whites. \n\nFor lunch, I'll order The Stuffed Avocado salad. A large bed of fresh lettuce, red onion, and tomatoes, and half an avocado stuffed with their housemade tuna salad. Ask for their house ranch dressing on the side and throw some black pepper on the salad, delicious.\n\nService is good and quick. They're always busy, but the food is quick to serve and tables are turned quickly as well. I also really like their Rewards Program. Not sure how long they've offered it, but I only learned about it about 8-10 months ago. I figured since I visit so often and always bring out-of-town visitors here, might as well participate and it has certainly paid off! Every month I receive a coupon flyer and earn rewards for every meal, so I have visited The Cracked Egg at least once or twice a month since I joined. Also, even with coupons accompanying almost every meal, I earned enough rewards to receive a $10 certificate in January!\n\nIf I'm looking for a quick, no-fuss, delicious breakfast, this is where I go, every time. It's definitely a favorite!"

Upon entry, I had to wait a few minutes before I was acknowledged. I asked for the patio because it was early and it wouldn't be so hot (this was about 8:20am).\n\nThe hostess was polite, sure, but nothing super friendly. Oh, EVEN BETTER!@ The waitress! Omg, she came with her notepad and asked for my order, the end. I thought she had a grudge against me or something. I got my check super fast so I also felt like she wanted me to leave asap. She asked if I needed a box when she gave me my check so I don't know if I looked like I was ready to leave or if she was mad that I got the patio and she had to walk out to check up on me or something.\n\nThe food was decent; the portions were big (for me). I got 3 sausage links (they also come in patties) and lots of hash browns and my 2 eggs. They also offer you the seasoned potatoes if you don't want the hash browns. You also get another side and I chose the coffee cake. It was bitter, but not that shabby.\n\nI signed up for their loyalty card in case I ever needed it. Maybe I'll try another location to check up on service. This third lady (I got helped by 3 people total) looked like she was the owner or manager or someone of that level. She was much more friendly and she processed my loyalty card and gave me points for it without me asking for it since I had forgotten about handing the card over to my waitress.\n\nOverall, I hope I get better service if I get the chance to eat here again."

Their food is always fresh and interesting and I've never had a bad meal here. I tried the Vaquero omelet which had green chilis, chorizo, salsa, and lots of cheese, sour cream, and salsa smothered on top. This was one heavy, flavorful dish but the eggs were still fluffy and made me want to nom nom nom all day. The sourdough toast was also really interesting and I'd definitely get that again, that's for sure! If you are looking for something lighter you need to try the banana walnut pancakes because they are heavenly.\n\nIf you are in search of a solid, inexpensive breakfast with a fun atmosphere and friendly waitstaff then eat at The Cracked Egg and thank me later."

I really didn't care for the Corned Beef hash & my boyfriend's French toast was kind of sad, and too dark. We asked for the Manager,  Ashley was so nice she asked if she could get us anything else we'd like... we were unsure.  I decided I was craving French toast and I really can't eat it because I'm allergic to wheat.  So I ordered it for myself but really I was planning on eating two bites and making the bf have it since his first order was just bad.  The French toast was delicious the second time around, nice golden brown.  By that time the place has cleared out and I decided maybe I will get something I can eat since they passed my \"french toast test\". Let's be honest if a brunch place can't nail French toast I wouldn't of stuck around.\n\nSo I wasn't crazy about the Corned beef hash serving I had, I figured I'll come back and try it another day maybe without onion next time and decided on the \"garden omelet\" it has mushroom and spinach on it.  I ordered it from the Gluten Free menu, totally loved the fresh ingredients veggies and melted cheese.  \n\n**They're Gluten Free Menu is the biggest I've seen anywhere ELSE!**\n\nWe plan on going back and bringing more friends/family here because I prefer this place over the Egg & I.

It get's crowded on weekends, but I'm assuming that's because of how awesome it is. While I don't really stray to far from my \"north shore scramble\",what I have tasted otherwise has been great as well. Staff is friendly and parking is always pretty easy as well. I enjoy when it gets a little warmer and I can sit outside, but inside is always fine as well. Will definitely be back, again and again and again."

I'm taking 2 stars off because of the service we get when we arrive and when we leave. If the older woman up front was more friendly upon arrival and when leaving maybe I wouldn't feel the way I do. It's such a shame! Such a great establishment and yet tainted by something as simple as greeting and saying goodbye. I understand at times it gets hectic and busy, you may lose your temper but you shouldn't make your guests feel like a burden when they ask to sit outside. You obviously have a patio and people are clearly sitting outside. Being in the industry I understand how frustrating customers can get but it's our job to give a great experience to keep them coming back. We've been coming here for over a year now and are the lowest of low maintenance when it comes to eating here. We know what we want, get in and get out. Foods great, waiters are great it's the leaving experience and coming experience that gives me a bad taste in my mouth :/ although I appreciate the nice gentleman who came by our table and apologized for not being able to accommodate our requests, even though it wasn't his fault, thank you good sir!"

Given that there are no other close breakfast place, you take what you can get, but it is still a disappointment given all the other rave reviews.\n\nLet me start with the coffee cake.  Please don't order this.  It is made with a generic white cake mix that is not even very good mixed in with some cinnamon mix and white frosting.  Actually, it is pretty gross to eat for breakfast.  \n\nYou know there is a question of quality when all of the menu items are put in \"quotations\".  Enjoy the \"Fresh-squeezed\" OJ as long as you realize it may be fresh squeezed, but it is the worst quality and cheapest OJ they apparently could get their hands on.  We had a variety of breakfast items including french toast, pancakes and some special \"hash\" item that is supposed to be a specialty.  I wouldn't order any of it again.  \n\nOn a positive note the service was excellent and someone in our party got a hamburger (for breakfast??) but at least I can say everyone at our table really enjoyed the french fries.\n\nAgain, at a minimum please DO NOT order the coffee cake, some of the worst breakfast sweets I have ever had anywhere."

I would think so!\n\nAnyways, the food: GREAT. I ordered a Tropical French Toast while the bf got the Southwestern Scramble. Shredded coconut + macadamia pieces + bananas +french toast = freakin awesome! With the coconut and the macadamia, you really don't even need the syrup or butter! The Southwestern Scramble was delicious as well: Omelet with cheese and other yummy goodness, seasoned potatoes and sausages.

Not a \"enjoy your meal, your server will be right with you, have a nice day\"...not even a flippin \"you, too.\" Or \" you're welcome.\"  This made me reluctant to even consider staying.  Fortunately the server outside was super friendly!  What a stark contrast. Super crappy hostess bit incredibly friendly waitress."

I usually come here with my boyfriend for breakfast. They're always busy but we usually get sat within 15-20 minutes. People are in and out! I am always greeted with awesome service and the vibe is such a family and home-y atmosphere. I really enjoy getting the nutella stuffed smores french toast. TO. DIE. FOR. I've probably gotten it like 5 or 6 times already! They also have some of the best seasoned potatoes in town. One of my absolute favorites! I also really like their omelets. They're super hot and fresh and you can make them however you want or they have a few you can choose from. I like The Denver! I've also had their skillets, DELISH! I always have a hard time choosing what I want to get. I want to try their whole menu because everything looks so good! Eventually I will be able to get to that point, but for now I have stuck with what I know is truly my favorite. The french toast. Go ahead, try it! You won't be disappointed!"

I drove down the street to this place, hoping it would be as good as its sister store in Henderson.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nI parked in a lot with only two cars, assuming I would get polite and decent service.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nI walked inside. A server yelled how many. I was a bit confused since I was by myself but figured she was wondering if there would be more to join me. I said I was alone and she waved her flabby arm in spokesmodel fashion--circular motion with long crescent finish--which I think means you can sit where you want. I did so and she asked if I wanted coffee. I said yes, hoping it was as good the java at the other Cracked Egg in Henderson.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nThat sorry ass brown liquid had a distinct soapiness flavor to it, as if the mug had not been properly washed. I ordered pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon, praying it would be half as decent as the same dish had been in Henderson.\n\nBoy was I wrong. \n\nThe cakes were fine but the bacon was cold and the eggs overcooked. Very dry at the bottom with brown strands of yuckiness flowing outward like jellyfish tentacles.\n\nThe manager was seated at the end of the counter, doing nothing except slipping me an evil eye here and there. Ditto for the other waitress. Sigh. And here I thought I'd be fawned over since the place was practically empty.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nMy server came over and griped if everything was fine. She seemed to be in such a hurry for me to leave. I nodded with practiced detachment and fell into my patented state of remoteness. I hear and see nothing when immersed in this form, much like a mental patient in advanced stages of catatonia.\n\nI was quickly given the check and paid with a mediocre tip. I went out to the lot and walked over to Starbucks. I bought some coffee and sipped it on the way home, thinking it would be as good as usual.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nTasted old. I also noticed the girl had slipped me a Canadian quarter. Christ. I was really hoping to have a semi-decent time this Sunday morning.\n\nBoy was I wrong."

I like old school friendly coffee shops and this has that charm.  Sadly, that's where it ended for us.\n\nMy Monte Cristo (did you think I wouldn't order it?), while tasty inside, was overdone and dark brown, not golden, just this side of burnt. It wasn't very big, nor loaded with meat, which is weird for a Monte Cristo since the whole idea of a triple layer ham, swiss and turkey sandwich dipped in french toast batter, fried and coated in powdered sugar is to be colossal and leave you stuffed.  The bread was standard grocery store loaf size.  It was offered with potatoes or hash browns, but I ordered fruit, which was melon and not very good.  End of story for me.\n\nHub had the House Original sandwich; roast beef and cream cheese with red onion , tomato and lettuce.  He asked for no tomato, and also sadly ordered fruit.\n\nThe sandwich was a shocker, with no more than a 1/4 lb of meat and cream cheese spread thin.  It also had tomato on it...oops. The beef was not freshly sliced.  The bread was again nothing special, average size and not extremely fresh.  For a signature sandwich, it was a big disappointment to my better half.  We were both still hungry when we left.\n\nThe service was very nice, quick, and pleasant, though I don't particularly like being called 'dear' by someone maybe 10 to 15 years younger than me.

If you want breakfast, and want it done well, go to The Cracked Egg!\n\nTHE FOOD: With my usual craving to devour everything on the menu, it's always a challenge to decide on what to order, especially at breakfast because it's my favorite meal of the day. I ended up ordering the Cakes & Eggs Combo so I could get a little bit of everything. The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the sausage patties were flavorful. DON'T get the sausage links, the waiters/waitresses even recommend against it, hahaha. The pancakes were really good too! The right amount of fluffiness drenched in an ocean of syrup (I did that myself, of course). \n\nThe Cracked Egg also serves coffee cake, and it's apparently somewhat popular. I had the opportunity to eat some of this coffee cake, and it was...chocolate...coffee cake? I really don't know how to explain it any better than that. It was okay, it just tasted like a dry chocolate cake with coffee cake crumble on top. Other people have told me they have had other types of coffee cake, so I'm guessing The Cracked Egg likes to change things up. If you're curious, I would ask the staff.\n\nThe staff is another topic. I didn't think they were very friendly. The woman who seated us (my mom, my stepdad, and I) practically threw our menus and utensils on the table without saying a word, and returned to the front of the restaurant. Our waitress was also very quick in wanting to get us to leave when the restaurant wasn't even half full.\n\nTHE VERDICT: Overall, the food is fantastic. The staff, not so much. I'll go back for the food, especially since I love a place that does breakfast well."

I really just wanted a quiet, peaceful gluten-free brunch before attending a family wedding. And we got just that. \n\nIt was perfect weather outside when we came. There was a nice breeze and just the loveliest kiss of warmth from the sun. Service from all staff was welcoming and friendly. To top it off, they had a separate gluten-free/celiac-friendly menu! I was immediately drawn to the gluten-free pancakes, toast, and muffins. I got myself a delicious corned beef hash with a warm chocolate muffin! I couldn't be happier with my morning, especially when prices were under $10. \n\nI am glad to have a found a local breakfast joint that is not too far from the strip. Now I have a go-to gluten-free diner whenever in Vegas."

            "review": "Good customer service is as crucial as good food. Although the food was quite delicious, the bad service we experienced left a horrible taste in my mouth.\n\nMy husband and I went for Sunday brunch and the hostess told us the wait would be about 20 minutes. The wait area inside was full so we waited outside with about 15 other people. We figured with this many people waiting that this place had to be good. About 25 minutes later, my husband checked with the hostess and she said she called his name about 20 minutes ago. Funny thing was that while my husband was inside talking to the hostess, a party of 5 next to me complained that they were never called and the hostess insisted she called them. They were more bothered (as was I) that the hostess insisted she called their name and didn't apologize for the inconvenience. A group of 4 who just paid walked out and were complaining about the rudeness of the hostess! Three groups complaining about the bitchiness of the hostess is not a coincidence!\n\nWhen we were finally seated, the hostess dropped our menu and our silverware on the table, didn't say a word and walked away. WOW. We waited a while for our waitress and she also had a sour attitude! I even asked my husband if I was just imagining things but agreed that she was not pleasant at all.\n\nAs I was making mental notes about what I should rant in my Yelp review, the coffee cake came out and managed to bring what was supposed to be a 2 star review to a 2.5/3. It was moist and heavenly!\n\nMy husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was decent but not the best we've ever had. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I loved the hollandaise and the thickness of the ham. The seasoned potatoes were the perfect complement to the eggs.\n\nNote to the management of The Cracked Egg: Bad attitude can really ruin a customer's service. On busy weekends, please ensure your hostesses and wait staff are smiling and friendly.  I would suggest to invest in pagers because it can be difficult to hear the hostesses when there are 15 people waiting outside and planes flying overhead. With Egg Works opening up down the street in Fall 2011, I doubt I'd come back here because of bad attitude I encountered even though the food was good."

You have to expend concerted effort to make scrambled eggs so dry and unappealing that even my kid, the scourge of all eggs,  won't eat them.

My husband and I don't go here often as we prefer other breakfast places around town. \n\nLet's start with the service - I've never gone into The Cracked Egg and had a negative experience. The staff is always friendly and polite. Also, they're very attentive and your drink cup is seldom empty. Sometimes there is a bit if a wait to get seated, especially on weekends. \n\nNow let's get into the grub - Their food is good. I wouldn't call it delicious, but it's pretty tasty. I ordered the Benedict Ole for $11.40. This breakfast includes two eggs benedict, but instead of ham, it comes with chicken and green chiles. I got to choose between shredded hashbrowns or seasoned potatoes; I chose the hashbrowns. As I said, the meal was pretty good, but the flavors were nothing that left me wanting more. The hashbrowns were also pretty standard. \n\nOverall, The Cracked Egg is a solid breakfast joint, but if you want to give other places around town a chance, I think you can find better. Also, their prices aren't really competitive when compared to other eateries. For two egg benedicts with hashbrowns, I paid almost $12.00. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere."

I recommend sitting at the counter, because you can get a great view of how the kitchen works and have great conversation with locals. We met a guy with an exotic car rental and I believe he thought we had moved to Vegas because this place is removed from the strip. It was awesome to hear his recommendations on what to order, his business, and what he loved about the area. We swapped Big Island stories and learned that we had seen one of his cars on the strip earlier in the week! I had a skillet with sweet potatoes, apple, bacon, munster cheese, and 2 eggs over easy. Everything was cooked just the way I liked it- I dare say \"like grandma used to make\" except  my grandma never made me eggs- but if she did I imagine this is how she would do it. The husband got the green scramble which was packed with veggies, he asked for sweet potatoes instead of hash browns (extra charge but well worth it in our book) and they came out great. The coffee refills were free but we had already drank our coffee (which is how we functioned enough to find this place) and I had tomato juice. I will send any and all of my friends off the strip to find The Cracked Egg. Everything looked spectacular leaving the counter (pancakes the size of plates!!!!!!) and from the look of it, The Cracked Egg is pretty popular! All in all, if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will be back!"

So yes, definitely get this.\n\nAs for their scrambles, omelettes, and skillet.... the portions are HUGE. I can't even finish it and my fiance who eats a ton is full off one of their dishes. It's insane just how much they give you. It's so filling because it's all carbs. (: So you know you'll definitely get the bang for your buck. But all I can say is that everything on their menu is DELICIOUS. Comes out fresh and hot and packed with flavors. \n\nI can't wait to go back to try more of their menu!! Getting so hungry thinking about it. Haha. They do have a lunch menu with sandwiches and stuff, but I think they serve breakfast all day."

I was not disappointed, it was delicious.  Also, they have an option of toast or coffee cake with a meal and, do yourself a favor, get the coffee cake. It was warm, it had raspberry filling, it is homeade, I wish I ordered one to take home.  The service was fast and friendly.  Stay away from the buffets and give this place a try.  \n\n*If you are coming from the strip, make sure you take down the number for your taxi so they can come back and pick you up.

My cousin recommended me this breakfast spot called, The Cracked Egg, which was only a few minutes away from the strip. The Cracked Egg on Rainbow Boulevard was located in a strip mall which was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. I guess that's what happens when it was over a hundred degrees out. This restaraunt closes at 3:00 P.M, which gave me the impression that their menu must be way above average to be able to serve only breakfast and have multiple locations.\n\nMe and my friend reached the restaurant first so we grabbed a table for us and our three friends that were going to meet us there. Our waitress was very kind and told us it was no problem to wait in our booth while we wait for our friends. She even brought out five waters for us while she waited for our group to get together. The menu had a large variety of breakfast foods. They had the typical breakfast foods of eggs, sausages, omelettes, skillets, burgers, and other things.\n\nI ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash, which was made of bell peppers, onions, and eggs. I chose to have hash browns and coffee cake on the side instead of seasoned potatoes and toast. The coffee cake arrived first and I was delighted to see that it was hot, instead of the usual cold pastries many breakfast places serve. Shortly after I finished my coffee cake, the table's main dishes came out. The Homemade Corned Beef Hash came out in a glass skillet styled dish.           It didn't resemble the typical corned beef hash found in cans, but it looked more like ham, bell peppers, and onions put underneath two scrambled eggs. My hash browns were served on a separate plate.\n\nI was very impressed with the quality of ingredients used to make such a simple meal. The eggs were fresh, and the cooking of the hash browns were perfect. None of the potatoes were burnt, unlike many other breakfast style restaurants. The Cracked Egg is probably one of the best breakfast spots I have been to. Their quality of food and service is probably why they can afford to open their restaurants until only 3:00 P.M! I will definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas for my breakfast fix!"

It was delicious, and what I thought was a \"healthy alternative\" probably wasn't because of the excessive amount of cheese that was packed into it (not to say I don't love cheese, but next time I'll be sure to request to tone it down a little more).\n\nThis location was extremely busy the Sunday morning I went, and because of such the service did take longer than usual.

We were quickly greeted with a smile, followed by being seated shortly after. Once seated we got our drink orders and food orders in quickly.\n\nAs for the setting it was perfect for an early morning breakfast. Felt like a home cooked meal sort of place. I ordered eggs and sausage. It came with hash browns and toast, which was plenty of food to fill me up. The portions are fairly large in my opinion. On a side note, the hash browns were probably the best I've had in a long time. They were very flavorful with the perfect seasoning to complete the meal.\n\nOverall the food was wonderful. It was fairly priced ans a good change to my typical Vegas cuisine. I recommend it to those looking for something new with the same foods, but with a great taste!"

It was also topped with a bunch of avocado which was a plus because I feel like when you go to breakfast restaurants and order anything with avocado they skimp the amount. It was topped with delicious hollandaise but they might have put a bit too much on mine but that is only a very minor complaint.

The entrance isn't designed too well as today you had to wade through a crowd to get to the register and ask to be seated or put your name on a list. When its time to go you have to wade through that same crowd to pay and then again to exit.  I know bars/clubs put in focal points to force patrons to mingle with eachother or to create the appearance of the place seeming \"hot\"  I just didnt appreciate the experience this early and espically to get a couple over easy eggs.  Simply stated the store is just to small for a restaurant this popular.\n\nThe food wasn't bad but my Mexican/Jalape\u00f1o dish was lacking in flavor and that is impressive as you really have to work hard to kill the flavor of a Jalape\u00f1o.\n\nThe service was pleasant enough but once my food was delivered I didn't see my waitress a single time (she gave me my check with the food) and nobody else stopped by to check on my 3/4 empty soda so it was a good thing my jalape\u00f1os weren't spicy or flavourful.\n\nI love this franchise but would recommend going on a non rush/less busy time so you can enjoy your food prepared with all the spices and ingredients they deserve and not be ignored.\n\nParking was a little tight as well.

Don't remember her name, but she was so sweet. \n\nThe Veggie Benny was absolutely delicious! Loved that they had a vegetarian friendly Benedict. The coffee cake with chocolate chips was awesome, but \n\nGreat place to come if you're in town visiting and don't want to eat breakfast on the strip. \n\nService was amazing, food was good, but nothing too special."

The waitstaff is extremely friendly and they're always smiling and upbeat. The service is great, even when it's extremely busy, which it usually is on Sundays. I've never had to worry about someone coming to refill my coffee, they always come around and offer refills at the perfect times. The coffee itself is GREAT. Best coffee at a restaurant I think I've ever had, and it's always served hot and tastes fresh. The food has never been disappointing. I tend to order the same two menu items frequently, but any time I try something new it's always good. The only remotely negative thing about this place is it's very popular so there does tend to be a wait time when we come in. However it's usually only 10 minutes tops and I think it's well worth the wait.  I will continue to come here every Sunday for as long as it's open."

Service is swift and friendly.\n\nI know it is an easy way to fluff a review by going item by item to describe, in depth, everything we ordered but... it was all excellent!  Eggs, Chicken Fried Steak, potatoes, sausage, pancakes (this is the entire table, not just my meal!) - everything they brought was excellent!\n\nOur server was swift and friendly, drinks were never empty, and we were out the door for 3 big meals, less than $30.  I will definitely be back. \n\nMy only knock is on my tip.  We asked to sit outside and in a huge, open patio, we are sat right next to two young gentlemen attempting to have a deep, personal discussion.  This was ackward for all involved.  It is impossible to zone out a conversation that is going on 4 feet away.  It was quite funny in retrospective, but a little common sense from the hostess would have been appreciated!"

I ask for some country gravy to help ease my pain and she ended up charging us $2 for a side of gravy.  \n\nMy dad asked for a medium steak.

We like to sleep in on Sundays.\n\nI probably ordered badly choosing a sandwich at what is undeniably a breakfast joint, I can't recall the name, but it was roast beef, red onion, tomato and lettuce on sourdough sliced bread with \"horseradish mayonaise\" - The sandwich was of undeniable high quality, but I was disappointed that I couldn't detect any distinctive horseradish taste in the mayo - it just tasted like standard Best Foods to me. I quite enjoyed the seasoned potatoes that accompanied my meal.\n\nWife had a skillet of some sort involving scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions, some hash browns and toasted English muffins. She enjoyed the lot, although wasn't so impressed with her hash browns - we both have very exacting standards when it comes to these.\n\nOverall we were prettty happy with our meal there - I would definitely order differently next time. For a ten buck sandwich I received something too close to what I could easily slap together at home, but the menu is reasonably extensive and the place was doing a roaring trade late Sunday morning. We will be back for further exploration."

Clearly known for their daily interpretations of classical coffee cake I will admit that I was a tad put off by both the microwaving and obvious use of canned peaches (as well as artificial syrup sitting on the counter) but speaking only to flavor the cake truly is as good as the rumors; light as angel food but topped with sugary streusel and rife with fruit.  Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious."

She is a true credit to the restaurant and the industry itself. \n\nIn regards to the food, I think my buddy gave the best review I've ever heard. After taking the first bite of warm homemade apple coffee cake, he looks up and with a giant grin says, \"This bite made me smile. I feel warm inside!\" \n\nThe food here is the epitome of comfort food. My first day, I ordered the Carnitas omelette with a slice of their homemade chocolate chip coffee cake (they have a different flavor of coffee cake every day). The carnitas were so tender and the eggs were cooked to perfection! I held the peppers and onions, but added avocado. \n\nToday I ordered the bacon cheeseburger skillet with hash browns instead of the country potatoes and a slice of homemade apple coffee cake (told ya they change the flavor every day;). It was amazing! In addition, every time I see skillets, there's usually a pool of oil at the end of meal. Not here my friends! Just pure deliciousness! This is a must stop spot for the Vegas vacation!"

She had the corned beef hash which is not what you'd expect. It's thinly slice strips of corned beef cooked with onions and bell peppers. She was expecting the more mushy type but she still enjoyed this one. I ordered the eggs benedict which was really good. The hollandaise sauce was delicious! The coffee cake itself was so soft of fluffy. mmmm I'd like to come back to try some of their other breakfast dishes. Gotta wait till October to come back to Vegas though. Oh well, this will be worth the wait."

Although she wasn't rude, she wasn't very friendly either. Our waitress, Emily, was very friendly and attentive. \n\nNow to the food ... I ordered a \"build your own skillet\" with pastrami, bacon, mushrooms, bell peppers, spinach, & broccoli. It was AWESOME; filled flavor and was very appealing to the eyes. My wife ordered the two egg combo with a waffle and potatoes; instead of eggs. I thought her food look great; she said it tasted average. \n\nThe eggs are definitely fresh but the potatoes are definitely from a bag. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere was good, the food was delicious, & the service was great!"

            "review": "In deference to the prior review of a good friend who received poor service here in 2010, I'll say that I'm hopeful that they've at least gotten rid of her terrible waitress some time in the last five years.\n\nAfter spending a few days in the center of the strip, we had a 1:10 flight out of McCarran to come home.  That gave us a perfect chance to have a nice leisurely breakfast.  After researching gluten-free options in the area (wife wanted more than a 'fruit cup', but didn't want eggs, yet ironically we still came her), I found The Cracked Egg mentioned at a gluten-free website we use.  A couple people had reported issues with cross-contamination, but the more recent mentions indicated less problems.  So, we thought we'd give it a shot.\n\nWife had a craving for simple pancakes with pecans (and of course syrup), which they could accommodate here.  They used \"Pamela's\"-brand mix, which we also use at home.  I'm going to assume they don't have a dedicated griddle surface, so if you really are extremely sensitive (wife usually is not), that may not work for you.  They also have gluten-free bread (but not a dedicated GF toaster).  The menu clearly states all this, and even has the heading \"Gluten Sensitive\" and not \"Gluten Free\", so we knew what to expect.  I'd seen a mention of gluten free English muffins in a prior review, but those were not available (nor mentioned on the menu) when we visited.\n\nThe gluten-free pancakes are quite large, and would have been $6.95 alone.  But for a little bit more, we ordered it as the \"Cakes and Eggs Combo\" for us to split, which added two eggs and your choice of meat (2 slices of bacon for me, obviously).  There was an additional $1 charge over the regular Combo price because of the GF pancakes, which I feel is fair, knowing the difference in cost between Pamela's and \"regular\" pancake ingredients.  It was plenty of food for the two of us.  We also picked up the breakfast of a coworker of hers, and even with three beverages, the bill was less than the celebrity \"burger, fries, and shake\" I had on the strip the night before (review to follow).  The coffee was good, and hot.  Add to that friendly and fast service (there was no wait at 11am on a Tuesday), and who am I to complain?\n\nMy pro-tip:  Sure, they have the fancy \"hash browns\", made of cubed seasoned potatoes, with bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream.  But if you're a purist like me, they also have the crispy shredded potato version that I prefer.\n\nThis location is on the southwest portion of town, and as a tourist who had been on the strip for four days, a calm way to transition back to \"reality\".  Since we had a rental, it really wasn't out of our way.  Just go like you are headed to McCarran, and where I-15 hits the 215, go a couple minutes WEST to Rainbow Blvd. (instead of east to McCarran/rental car return) and it's a couple blocks north from there.  Took about five minutes to drive to the rental car return from there.\n\n3.95 stars"

It was a very homely enviornment. Yes, the coffee cake is a must. The day we went, we had the pumpkin pecan coffee cake, and it was a great start to our meal. I got the Country Benny with Hash Browns. It was really good! I would definitely get this again with extra gravy!! My boyfriend got the California Omlete with Potatoes. It was also pretty good. My only complaint about this place was how much they charged for the side sauce. A side of salsa and a side of sour cream were both $1+ each. I think $.50 - $.75 is more reasonable. It's a ways from the strip, but a great place to eat before heading back home to California. We will definitely be back!"

I had the tuna melt it was OK. It was a little tart because there was a lot of relish in there. The Monte Cristo sandwich has got to be taken off the menu that was nasty! Kind of bummed about it cause I barely ate anything. Walked out with an empty stomach. I had the mushroom swiss burger and it was good, however, I noticed the patty was already cut in half. Who in the right mind cuts a burger patty in half and then serve it? I've always had the create your own skillet thingy. That was good BUT a little skimpy on some ingredients. All-in-all the food is mediocre. Not too shabby for a breakfast, brunch or lunch place."

Comes with half and half, raisins, granola, fresh berries, brown sugar, etc. It is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten and the ingredients and so fresh. If you join their breakfast club, they send you coupons in the mail all the time too. There really isn't a bad thing to say about this place, except that if you get there between 9-10am, you are going to wait a while for a seat! My boyfriend and I visit at least twice a month!"

But it is my favorite breakfast/lunch place in Vegas.\n\nThe decor is sort of country chic, with booths and tables.  You can sit outside, inside or at the bar.  On weekends, at peak times, there is often a wait to get a table, so plan accordingly!  To me, it's worth the wait.\n\nThe food is awesome.  My \"go to\" lunch is \"The Club\" sandwich, piled so high with meats, cheese, tomatoes, avocados and lettuce that it actually needs the long toothpick to hold it together.  And the avocados are actually ripe and tasty.  As a Californian, that's super important to me.  (There's not much worse than an unripe avocado!)  I usually eat half and take the rest home.  I've had both fruit as a side, as well as potato salad.  I loved the potato salad, which is homemade, using red potatoes.\n\nI crave their blueberry pancakes.  They're pretty simple.  Blueberry pancakes.  Short stack is three large pancakes.  But they use fresh blueberries.  So it's perfect.  It goes great with their fresh-squeezed orange juice.\n\nI've also had their Denver omelette.  Cooked perfectly, with a nice layer of cheese on top.  Seasoned potatoes are awesome.  If you opt for hash browns, they are crispy and perfectly cooked.\n\nService was attentive.  The waitress checked every few minutes to see if we needed anything.  Bathrooms are very clean.\n\nAll in all, I love this place.  It's not fancy.  But if you want a solid breakfast/lunch spot with lots of options, this is a good one."

This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend. \n\nWe stopped by this location on the first day and the service was fast and friendly and I was impressed at how familiar with gluten-free dining my server was. I also loved that they have a separate gluten free menu which you can request.\n\nSO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes. On my visit here I was so excited for all of these options that I ordered a bit too much food so beware, the portions are quite large.\n\nAt this location I tried the Southwest Scramble which consisted of eggs, chorizo, green peppers, pickled jalapenos, onions and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was super tasty but the hash browns stole the show - perfectly seasoned and crispy! \n\nI also ordered two gluten-free pancakes and they were excellent - large, fluffy and a little crispy on the edges - could not tell they were gluten free!\n\nMy husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs! I was jealous but was more than elated with my own meal.\n\nWill most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches."

I'm a corned beef hash fan, except when it comes from a can (which is how most places serve it.)  This really is made from scratch and delicious. My partner had oatmeal which seemed a little pricey at first. But when we saw the size and all the fresh add-ins (served on the side) we saw it was worth it. Even better, this wasn't 1 minute instant oats."

I took my goddaughter here on a very busy Saturday around noon and we waited for about 15 minutes.  They sat us in a booth and gave her a coloring sheet and some colored pencils to keep her occupied.  Whoever created the concept of coloring sheets at restaurants is a genius!!  Instant distraction for the wily children.  Thank you sir (or m'aam?). \n\nMy goddaughter is obsessed with noodles, and they didn't have any, much to her disappointment, but they did have a fun little kids menu so I ordered her a pb&j and some fries.  She loved her fries and did not touch the sandwich.  I ordered a half cobb salad with blue cheese dressing.  It was HUGE!  I think it needed more bacon and chicken because there was barely any on there and their blue cheese dressing tasted kind of plain.  If you're gonna splurge on calories and fat, you want some \"blow my mind\" blue cheese, right?  So yeah, I give the salad 3 stars.\n\nI give this restaurant 4 stars though because I love their breakfast, and the service is always good.  I like the atmosphere, the feeling of being in a \"bustling\" diner."

They give you an option for egg whites (I prefer the whole egg for my breakfast...get some of the good fat into my diet), and rather than seasoned potatoes or hash browns, they give you the option to have a fresh fruit plate with your breakfast.\n\nI ordered The Greek Omlette, which had spinach, diced tomatoes, and feta cheese on top.  It was really good, and not too big, like so many other places.  \n\nMy fella had the cobb salad with no avocado, and oil and vinegar dressing.  He enjoyed it, however, a word of caution:  Don't order the Hot Bacon dressing.  It appears to be ranch dressing with bacon grease mixed in.  It wasn't served hot, and it was absolutely disgusting. (I took a small taste.) \n\nThe breakfast also came with coffee cake, which I, sadly, only had a small bite of...but it was really good too.\n\nAll in all, the food was solid.  Not anything mind-blowing, but it was a good choice.\n\nService was a little slow to start, as it took a little while for someone to come over for drink orders...and by the time they did, we knew what we wanted to eat, but realistically, it wasn't that bad of a wait...we got to visit a bit, and the place WAS packed.  \n\nI'd come back again for sure."

However, it is a reliable breakfast spot and sometimes that's all you need to be. \n\nRecently I had the chili omelette which was delicious and the other day I got the polish sausage and poached eggs.   \n\nLike I said, everything there is solid, no surprises and the service is always good.  Will always be my go-to, especially when some of the other trendy places in my neighborhood are on crazy waits."

My meal was delivered within 10 minutes, and I'm wondering if it's because our waitress saw the hurried expression on my face. \n\nThe Pesto Scramble: The scramble contains chicken, spinach, and feta cheese. It also comes with a choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes, and a choice of coffee bread or toast (passed this up). My lunchtime meal was on the bland side -- no wonder the waitress gave me a bottle of \"hot sauce\" to shake over my scramble and hash browns. \n\nThe place was busy at around 12:30, but it wasn't packed with diners. Waiting for a seat shouldn't take too long.  If you want a fast sit-down meal, then The Cracked Egg might be your best bet. Their Pesto Scramble assuaged my hunger but didn't satisfy my taste buds."

I had pretty high expectations for a place that has the word egg in their restaurant name.  I imagined pretty big egg portions for the price.  Alas, it was not.  I had the Northshore scrambler, lots of filler stuff mixed in the egg and it tasted good but if only it were, say, a little bit bigger...maybe by another inch?.  With the Northshore you have a choice of hash browns for diced potatoes.  For some reason, my potatoes arrived cold.  Well, maybe that's overstated.  But, it wasn't hot like my eggs.  Perhaps it's cooked in bulk and left i an aluminum tray.  I also tried the Croissant French Toast with berries.  I'm expecting something way better than IHOP.  The bread was hard upon arrival and it was also cold.  About half the blueberries where sour and half the strawberries were as well. I'm thankful they give you lots of syrup to drown it out.  The highlight of the meal is the nice warm coffee cake that several reviewers state is awesome.  Yes, it is.  I wanted another slice.   The staff are prompt and courteous and checked on us frequently. I like that since it started to get busy as soon as we arrived and server attentiveness usually goes down as the number of customers increase.  We tend to bring a crowd soon after we  arrive, not cause we're famous or even know these people who follow us.  We just seem to be one of Murphy's Laws.  Whether we are at a drive thru at Jack In The Box or in line at the M casino buffett....geez.  Will I go back again? Yes, but it won't be my first choice on my mind."

However, this would make it my favorite brunch place in Vegas! \n\nI was on a gal pals weekender trip to Vegas and we choose The Cracked Egg to end our two days of gorging (which is what gal pals do: get fat together and chat about life and getting fat). \n\nWe lucked out as we were seated right away. The service was prompt and attentive. Our server took our drink order within a minute of us being seated and seemed to return with beverages almost instantly after. \n\nThe menu is just stocked but not too stocked (i.e. Jerry's Famous Deli). It seemed like everything was really well planned and that they only put real bangers on their list of offerings. \n\nWe asked for recommendations and were informed that all of the boxed items were considered the more popular and highly demanded items so we paid those extra attention, but our server also shared some of her favorites. A staffer with favorites that aren't boxed tells me the food's awesome either way so I was excited. \n\nWe all decided to pick an item and then eat our meal family style. What we selected were:\n\n- Chocolate chip banana pancakes: I usually see banana pancakes OR chocolate chip pancakes so seeing both in one on a menu made it an automatic selection. They were everything I wanted and more. The dish came with three pancakes, all ozzing with melty chips and sweetened by bananas that were juuuust about caramelized, but still fresh tasting. They were so good I didn't need butter or syrup, but I still smeared butter, because I can't deny my inner fatty. \n\n- Chicken tenders, gravy, and eggs\nHow have I not had this before? The chicken tenders were great on their own, but with The Cracked Egg's gravy, hashbrowns, and over medium eggs, we were swooning. (only critique is that I prefer my hashbrowns a little browner)\n\n- Corned beef hash\nReally good. I consider it a cleaner version than the usual greasy and chunky standard, but I enjoyed it. \n\n- Veggie Benedict\nIt seemed plain with just avocado and tomato but, man, was it tasty. The tomato was lightly cooked so it oozed flavor and was delicious combined with the avocado, hollandaise, and yolk from the poached egg. \n\n- Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake\nYou mean this was FREE? We got two pieces since two of our dishes (the corned beef and tenders) came with an option of biscuit or coffee cake. This was ABSOFRIKKINLUTELY a surprise. This took your usual coffee cake, grabbed it by throat, and kicked it in its genitalia. \n\nOh and the prices were really fair for brunch (cuz, yaknow, LA brunch like to act like it deserves dinner prices). \n\nBy the time we left, the place was swamped, but the staff was very visibly keeping everything moving so I don't think anyone waited too long. \n\nThis was the perfect spot to end our weekend and I hope I'm back in Vegas soon to hit up those tenders!"

The chocolate milk tasted like hershey's syrup mix but watered down.  I also tried a couple bites of the huevos rancheros which actually wasn't too bad.  flavors were very bold and quite yummy.

The eggs are rarely over done or underdone (I order over easy on my skillets).  The potatoes are crispy and hot. The coffee is standard but I'll let that slide cause this place isn't called \"The cracked bean\".\n\nOverall, Cracked egg is an eggs-traordinary breakfast spot! Good eats and good meets.

I would actually make a pit stop here just for this if I'm driving to and from Vegas\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#oZXMxk_GLSoepyhkWveiJQ\n\n2) Country Benny - Biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs, and smothered in gravy. I liked the gravy because it was flavorful and had a good consistency (not too watery or too thick). The eggs were poached well and the seasoned potatoes were so good! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#V-3L8nJ43gnSCuKv08V0wQ\n\n3) Sausage and Eggs were pretty standard thick links with eggs and seasoned potatoes. It was good, but nothing special. You could probably buy the same links at a market and make it yourself.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#fbjiuYm9Je2vHxb9QXLOaw\n\nService:\nThe servers were very nice and checked on us regularly to see how we were doing. You actually have to go up to the front to pay, which I found to be pretty inconvenient."

The Cracked Egg showed up on my google search, and I'm so glad it did.\n\nWe got there shortly after 9 on a Saturday morning with 6 people.  It took about ~20 minutes to seat us, which was expected.  I had looked over the menu while waiting, so by the time we sat down I knew what I wanted.  In fact, as soon as I saw it on the menu I didn't even have to keep looking.  Peanut butter stuffed french toast drizzled with bananas and honey.  This was one of my most favorite breakfasts ever.  It was like heaven on a plate!\n\nAll of the food we got was really good.  2 of the people I was with got coffee cake with their breakfasts, and boy was I jealous!  The type of coffee cake varies by whatever pan happens to come out of the oven, and they ended up with peach.  It was moist and warm and so good.\n\nBreakfasts ordered:  Eggs Benedict, Monte Cristo, bacon cheeseburger skillet, and at least one other thing that I don't remember because I didn't taste it.  Everything was good.  I'm glad I got to taste a little bit of eveything, because they were all delicious.  I still stand by my decision of the peanut butter french toast.  yummy!  I can't wait until next Sept. when I'll be out there again for a repeat trip!"

I just realized as I started to write my review that I had a choice of coffee cake, but the waitress simply asked me what kind of toast I wanted, which made me forget the coffee cake! The coffee cake denial almost forced me to take a two star deduction because I can make better toast than the whole wheat that was delivered to me instead of the cakey treat. However, I will be kind... for now. \n\nI ordered a vegetarian skillet and had them hold the cheese. I recommend this if you want a little lighter breakfast. I added some ketchup and hot sauce to create a delicious offering. The ingredients seemed fresh, and there was no heavy breakfast grease. The skillet potatoes were not covered with any magic dusting of spices, but they were still tasty. \n\nOne added bonus is that with most of the breakfasts they offer  a choice of shredded hash browns or cubed potatoes. Have you ever been to Waffle House? Well, these hash browns are like those, except with about 1/3 of the grease, and I am pretty sure you can't get them diced, smothered, and covered.\n\nOn a Saturday morning around 9:30am there was no wait. Our waitress was nice and prompt. Our food was delivered in a timely manner. \n\nI will be back for my coffee cake."

We wanted breakfast, but nothing on the strip is gluten-free friendly.  We searched online and found \"The Cracked Egg.\"  A local breakfast spot that has three locations in Vegas that indeed caters to people eating gluten-free!  We were excited and drove to the south Vegas location.\n\nAfter going the wrong way off the freeway, we turned around and found \"The Cracked Egg.\"  It is in a nice little outdoor strip mall/  Easy to find once you get going the right way. Upon walking in, we were greeted by the hostess, told them we would like the gluten-free menu and that we wanted to eat outside on their patio.  If you get a chance and it isn't 100 degrees outside yet, take advantage of eating outside on the patio!\n\nThe gluten-free menu is two full pages!  Yes...you can order gluten-free pancakes and french toast here!!  After studying the menus, we decided upon an omelet and a scramble. Both were huge portioned and VERY, VERY delicious!  It's places like this that makes me love breakfast food!\n\nThe staff here is very friendly and helpful.  They always had a smile on their faces.  Oh...I can't forget...they have those chocolate mints up at the cash register.  The pricing is a few dollars more than I expected, but it's a breakfast spot and it's in Vegas.\n\nWhile it may not be on the strip, \"The Cracked Egg\" is about only a 5-10 min. drive away.  It well worth the drive to have a breakfast that's delicious and gluten-free!"

The service is fast, sweet and never let your mugs go thirsty.  They serve the coffee cake hot which is an awesome touch.  Everything was good, nothing in the great category.  Mom and I both thought the coffee cake, while moist and soft  to the extreme, was a sugar overload for us and she rued the decision to order toast.  So all in all, 3 to 3.5 stars.  \n\nP.S.

It's pretty small inside too so there's lots of pushing past people and saying excuse me and all that.   In terms of breakfast/brunch places in Vegas, the Cracked Egg is better than Black Bear Diner but not as good as Hash House a Go Go.  Better than IHOP and much better than Pancake House.

A friend said that her family loves breakfast here, so I tagged along and tried the Cracked Egg. \n\nWe waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. I ordered denver omelette with wheat toast and crispy potatoes. Good thing I did not order drinks because our server rarely filled my friends' drinks. Our orders came a little longer than expected (side thoughts: maybe they're still harvesting our eggs, or maybe it's really a good breakfast!) I was quite disappointed. The egg of the omelette was dead dry, and the vegetables inside were sad and did not really came out with good flavors. I added chalula, salt, pepper, catsup, perhaps some tabasco, still was not a good omelette. My crispy potatoes were crispy, a little on the burned side. The toasts were thin, kinda falling apart if you dont take extra caution when putting jam. Hehe! I honestly think that our hospital cafeteria makes a better version of breakfast than Cracker Egg. Haha! Not a fan for sure!"

If you want to sit right away, try and snag a stool at the counter. \nCoffee cake is always amazing, and I have yet to order an item that wasn't amazingly delicious. The pesto scramble though, WOW! \nThe service is always great and the staff does a gear job balancing their time with all the different customers. \nIf you don't like eating in a crowded restaurant or enjoy solo dining, this is maybe not the place for you. Lots of families, but because of the crowded atmosphere, they have nowhere to run or cause a scene aside from the table they're sitting at. (I'm clearly not a parent). \nPlease check this place out!!"

On a Saturday of course it'll be busy but we only had to wait about 15 minutes. We got a lovely booth very spacious and nice lighting. Our never got our servers name, but she always has a big flower in her hair. She was awesome! She was always checking to make sure we had enough water and coffee, that is awesome customer service! I always order the Mexican skillet with jalape\u00f1os on the side and salsa on the side. It's absolutely delicious!  with any breakfast order you can either get toast or a coffee cake. I always get the delicious coffee cake which is different every time. They are always good so don't freak out. I was just so impressed with my service yesterday I felt obligated to write a review!"

The first time the service was bad, we were ignored most of the time, and when we asked for something we were given attitude. After the meal I complained to the manger and he offered us two free breakfasts if we came back. So it's been 6 months and we decided to try again. Sad to say it wasn't any better. We were given a booth up front so I thought we would have more attention. Nope it's a thursday morning they were not busy, and my father and I only got a refill once on our coffee. We didn't even see the waitress until the food was delivered. The prices were high for the quality you got as well. Never going back to that location. If I'm going to pay that much I would rather go to JAMMS. At leaset you are taken care of and are met by friendly people."

Breakfast at Broken Yolk is as good as it gets, but expensive, crazy busy and with long waits.  I expected the same here, but got the opposite. Wasn't busy for breakfast and food is decently priced.  However, another opposite is that the food was just okay, not great.  I expected Broken Yolk type servings and taste, but got more of IHOP/Denny's taste.  I'm not saying the food was horrible, it was just okay.  \n\nI had the Cheeseburger Meat Lover's Skillet.  Satisfying, but wasn't too far off from Denny's version.  Portion wasn't that big either, but not complaining about it since it wasn't over-priced. \n\nService was just average as well.  Seated right away, but it took a little time for our orders to get taken.  Remember, it wasn't busy.  Also a little disappointed that my water wasn't filled until after I was done eating.  \n\nWill I be back?  I might if I'm in the area.  Nothing wrong with the Cracked Egg in my opinion, just not what I expected.  Average price, average taste."

We walked in, and there were three people at the desk. It literally took two whole minutes to be acknowledged. Anybody who's had A JOB knows customers should be greeted within what, like 5 seconds? They were all laughing and joking with each other, clearly not talking about anything restaurant related: basically ignoring us. The young girl with braces and glasses - I'm sure she's really sweet, but her customer service sucks. Sucks. Girl, your service sucks. \n\nThe waitress seemed annoyed to have to take our order. She also didn't want to listen.  We said \"could we please have waters and orange juice?\" She came back with 1 water, 1 orange juice. ......um no one for each, what a weird f*cking way to interpret that. \n\nMeanwhile, we're at the booth right by the register and get to listen to the three stooges the whole time. They should market \"you get pancakes AND you'll feel like you're in high school again!\" \n\nThe food was good. Stars got docked for customer service only. \n\nThe very basics were just so terribly lacking that it compelled me to attempt to make the owners aware. \n\nBut the food is good! If you don't get bothered easily by all that BS then go here!\n\n****Oh, and your \"in uniform only\" military discount is so stupid!! So, so, so stupid. They have tons of ways to prove they're military and the majority of them won't be in uniform, so way to indirectly NOT support the military. Your cheapness is really apparent.****"

Our waitress came by shortly and were handed a menu. There are no pictures just words on a double sided laminated paper. I ended up ordering the Eggs Benedict Ol\u00e9 thay came with hashbrowns while my S/O ordered a giant omelet that came with potatoes and coffee cake.\n\nThe portions were huge and the food delish! I love perfect eggs (lol) and this place sure satisfied by liking. My S/O finished his omelet but passed on the potatoes. The coffee cake you may ask? It was so so soooo good.\n\nI have never tried coffee cake before but it was great! It didn't taste like coffee (so not sure where the name comes from) and was filled with custard! My S/O isn't a fan of custard so I happily scooped the plate clean. \n\nSo why 4 stars? Well, after ordering our food and watching people that came after us receive their food, we were starting to wonder if they forgot about us. Other than that, friendly staff and awesome food. Will definitely come back again should there by a chance I'll be able to."

Breakfast/Lunch items and it's always the same. Weekends are always busy,but never have waited over 15-20 min. Just make sure to give your name to the host. Everything seems fresh. Scrambled eggs are real and not powdered like at a buffet. Service is usually very good have had 1 semi-bad one though. Never had cold food. Coffee never dry. No upset stomach. Just always consistent. Tables,seats,floor,windows,utinsels,cups,and plates are always clean. No smoking.\n Some things I don't like,but still consistent. We always have to ask for more cream,sugar,and jelly. They are provided at the table just low or empty. The Steak with steak and egg's is thin. They ask you how would you like it cooked and I don't know why. Rare or Med rare is impossible. Tell them medium and it well be well done! It's just to thin! Better deals on that elsewhere. Home fries aren't fresh potatoes but the wife digs them. You are going to pay over $10 per person. Biscuits and Gravy are $10.99. I've don't think I have ever seen them over $6-7 any place else.\n  Overall I like it because it always the same. You no what to expect after going there a few time's. Also like I said, everything just seems fresh,and real eggs are used for everything."

Food was good, and filling. $10 for an omelette with potatoes and a slice of coffee cake. Food wasn't super amazing but i liked it, and i mean how can you argue with a price like that?\nThe only comment i have to make is the hostess, she wasn't friendly, didn't smile or say hello, she instantly said \"table for two?\" And started walking with menus before i could even answer and say i wanted to order to go. I work in food too, I'm a manager at my store, and i think having friendly service is one of the most important things a restaurant can have! Other than that, great breakfast place.

The portion is huge and the piece of country fried steak keeps it's crunchy composure when covered in the gravy. \n\nOmelets- I haven't eaten a bad omelet here. The options are endless and all get served with nice fluffy eggs and those scrumptious fried potatoes! \n\nThe service- Is always top notch. Drinks are always refilled and you never have to wait 30 minutes for a check. \n\nThe not-so-good: \nEggs Benedict- I once ordered this entree and the piece of ham had a huge piece of cartilage in it. It spanned across half of the piece of ham. It was so unappetizing that it took me almost 6 months to return here to eat. \n\nThe long wait time- If you are unfortunate enough to get here after 9am on a weekend or on a holiday, be prepared to wait. I have waited in excess of 30 minutes for a table of 2. I attribute the long wait to the lack of non-IHOP breakfast joints in the Centennial Hills area. We need an omelet house over here!"

If runny eggs and pancakes were a drug I would be serving a life prison sentence right now and cooking contraband fried eggs with my moonshine.\n\nI've known the Cracked Egg was there, but I was sticking to what I knew. Alternatives in the area include the stellar fine dining of IHOP or Mimi's Cafe. I'm pretty sure those two places also serve as alternatives for nursing home field trips on the weekends. \n\nWe actually tried the Cracked Egg on the recommendation of a friend, which is funny since we don't actually have any friends. That is how good it is. \n\nI like the portions and the food is much higher quality than IHOP. You can literally taste chicken suffering in IHOP's eggs, so the eggs with slightly fewer injected hormones are refreshing and appreciated by both my digestive system and my delicate pallet. The food has been good every time I've visited the Cracked Egg. \n\nThey also have a rewards card you can get and add to your ridiculous reward card collection, and they will send you a pretty good $8 coupon each month. It actually turns out cheaper than another breakfast place even without the coupon. And I enjoy it more, so it's a win either way. Except for my digestive system because it doesn't know me and it doesn't understand my life.\n\nI gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because their service is sometimes on the \"ignoring you\" level of bad. I expect a minimum of mediocre service every time because I am such a demanding customer and stuff."

OK people before you get carried away I am not saying it is the best burger in sin city I am simply saying it is the best burger I have HAD in Vegas. \n\nMy wife and I had made our first visit to this fine establishment about a year ago, let me start off by saying I am not a breakfast person. Now I know what your thinking, but hold the slings and arrows for just minute and let me explain myself.  It is not that I am apposed of eating a scrumptious meal in the morning, in fact I am quite fond of it, however for every waffley, syrupesc, eggtastic creation in existence I always seem to find something much more appealing on any lunch or dinner menu.  Now my wife on the other hand being the complete opposite as one of those breakfast for dinner kind of folks, this is the perfect place for us.\n\nSo now with that being said if you are looking for a great place that serves both breakfast and lunch with no time restrictions this is the place for you.  My wife has tried everything from the biscuits and gravy to the eggs benedict, to a southwest scramble I was particularly fond and everything has been extremely above par. Also I will say again they do make one tasty burger which , of course, is served with french fries that are also out of this world.  So yeah I'll end by saying,\"Go to The Cracked Egg\".

We went for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy , so we walked right in and sat down. You have a choice of sitting at a counter ( thats right a real cafe counter) or at tables. Four of us had 2 Monte Cristo sandwhiches (thanks Yelpers for the tip that they served these here - hadn't had one in many a day) ( and no , were not big eaters) They were great, service was great, definitely will come back and in fact this is my new favorite place to eat lunch."

The interior was clean and had a lot of the traditional welcoming breakfast place type feel.  The service was excellent.  A coffee cup never went empty and the waitress took a lot of special requests.\n\nI would say the breakfast food here is good, but does not separate itself in any way shape or form from what you could get at any other breakfast place in the valley.  Sometimes there is something to be said for simplicity and I can respect that.  I'm not asking that the menu become some fusion high end kitchen.  The chicken friend steak was not very crisp, which for me is the make or break point for a chicken fried steak.  The gravy was good, but lacked that extra bit of flavor to set it apart.\n\nAll that being said, this is a great place to go if you want a simple, traditional breakfast place.  This place is great for the traditional east coast tastebuds and preferences."

            "review": "This place reminds me of Babystacks because of the similar presentation of food and portions! Cracked Egg's menu, though, is a bit bigger (not inferior though!) It's a breakfast/lunch place open from 6am-2pm Monday-Friday and 6am-3pm Saturday and Sunday.\n\nWe came here on Saturday around lunchtime. It felt a bit weird when we saw a $5 bill at our table when we got seated. Of course, we assumed that it was for the waiter and that it had been from a previous visitor. When our waiter came, he surreptitiously slipped it in his pocket. Haha no worries. Our drink runner was nice, but I got the feeling she was a bit inexperienced (e.g. spilling drinks, telling us she need to clear our table in order for use to be seated). Not a big deal though.\n\nThe menu came with plenty of add-on options and pretty exhaustive menu full of breakfast/lunch choices like skillets, make-your-own skillets, burgers, sandwiches, and even just the simple stuff like eggs and omelets. Definitely fun to check out.\n\nI got the Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend got the Mexican skillet. The eggs were intertwined with the flurry of cheese, jalapenos, beans, salsa, and giant dollop of sour cream on top. It comes with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I got the seasoned potatoes which came in its own dish of small cubed potatoes poised perfectly in spices and fried. A bit crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The dish was definitely LDL-cholesterol-inducing. But whatever, I'm here to eat and cure post-First Friday regrettable drinking habits.\n\nAt first I thought their portions were small, but that was just the presentation. Our skillets came in sleek oblong casserole bowls served on white plates so it kind of fooled me for a second there. By the end of the meal I was dying to finish the last bite. I felt it was perfectly portioned and tasty too! It had this \"home-cooked\" feeling to it and completely savory, mouth-wateringly good. Surprisingly, my Huevos Rancheros wasn't doused in grease like I was expecting it to be, (haha like that's still any better for you at all) so I wasn't chomping down on anything oily. And my plate WASN'T dripping with fatty oil on the bottom like at Denny's. Adds to the quality of the food for sure. It's the little things you have to think about that sets the joint apart.\n\nThis place is a step-up in quality and taste from your usual Denny's and IHOPs for your usual prices ($5-$14ish). Of course at your local Denny's there's that sexy super value menu for that quick bite, but hey, this is yelp and you want a quality breakfast/lunch locale off the beaten path right? It's worth a venture that's a great restaurant--clean and courteous. Service was attentive for me! Make sure to sign up for their loyalty card service if you plan on frequenting! There's some perks involved and why not? I know I'm definitely coming back here."

The servers we've gotten the 3 times so far have been nice and kept up on our drinks throughout...nothing makes me more upset than having a mouthful of syrupy delight and zero to wash it down. I had full drink the whole time. Was busy but we got a table right away twice and once just a simple 5 minute wait while a table cleared. We go closer to when they close so we probably scrap by rush. \n\nNow onto foods-\n\n1st time\nBenedict Ole- YUMMY! Diced chicken and green chiles were a nice twist to this benedict and went really well all together. Probably my favorite non sweet dish so far.\n\nPeanut Butter Stuffed French Toast- Really nice, served with bananas. Only downfall was it was very rich, but since my BF and I share dishes it broke up the richness so that we can enjoy more than a few bites. \n\n2nd time\nJoes Scramble- beef, cream cheese, spinach, scallions, cheddar and jack cheese . Good and big portions, again I got a side of their potatoes included and I like em. Nicely fluffy eggs, not overcooked.\n\nDaily Special on the whiteboard- Special K covered french toast with fresh fruit. This was yummy! I love cereal and french toast (I do Captain Crunch at home but rarely make- messy). This wasnt overwhelmingly sweet or rich than our last french toast, just right.\n\n3rd time\nMontecristo- Turkey, Ham, cheese sandwich battered and fried. One of my guilty pleasure foods-  and they do it right here.  I guess everything is better deepfried like a twinkie, but here it was not soggy and served right away.\nWaffle with fruit- yummy and simple comfort. \n\nUPDATE- 6/12/10 Got the Joe's Scramble (ground beef, spinach, cream cheese, melted cheese) this was simple and good, but not a favorite. Croissant French Toast- this was yummy, eggy, and buttery. It came with a nice spread of bananas, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries that were all very fresh. \n\nOverall has been pleasing service and food so will come whenever we actually wake up early enough to have brunch on weekends. This is definitely a favorite breakfast spot....Yummy and I'm not that big on breakfast really.\n\nUPDATE 10/24/10\n\nGot the Ole Benedict. Still yummies. Still my favorite. Service is consistently very good and friendly. Quality breakfast is a real treat when you're a night person and today we woke up early enough to come before they close."

Actually, a wild idea, you can eat your lunch for breakfast!\n\nThey have some really great-tasting soups.

In the past, they've had split pea, clam chowder and chicken tortilla.  \n\nMy favorite is their burgers.  They are very fresh tasting/looking.  These are burgers that I crave!  They are always cooked perfectly (medium for me, well-done for the hubby) and always taste so good!  They are large in size and well worth the money ($6.95 - 8.25).  We like the basics so we stick to cheeseburgers and they are always good.  Although, when it is a special, I love their mushroom burger.

They use frozen diced potatoes and smothered in gravy means a very small dab, if you want more it will cost you. Waitress never even asked if we wanted more coffee. The only good thing was the coffee cake. Find somewhere else, this place is not worth the hype"

I like sitting in the section off to the side rather than where the door is. The front section is a bit cavernous and feels \"warehousey\" I am aware this is not a word, but it seems like the best description. Despite that, I am willing to tolerate it cause the food is good.\n\nI think my favorite dish here is the Chicken Fried Steak. Smothered in country gravy and served with your choice of  eggs, potatoes and toast. The steak is nicely breaded, superbly crispy and mouthwateringly yummy. I like to step it up a notch and sub the toast for biscuits with even more gravy. And of course I like scrambled eggs (when I like eggs) and the seasoned potatoes. My second \"usual\" is the Monte Cristo. \n\nYou know the saying, \"stick to what you're used to.\" I should have heeded that one morning. I tried their raspberry french toast. Eww. Not happy. Not sweet. So unappetizing to me that I barely made it through one slice. Their presentation is a bit lacking but really what can I say. As far as local breakfast places go, I'm usually not in it for the presentation. Heck, most of the time I'm not even awake enough to appreciate it.\n\nThe portions are pretty generous and the service is quick and friendly. My bf likes it, I like it. The hot chocolate is good. All in all, a win win place for me."

However, with that said it is consistent in the ways it excels and also lacks. The reason for the 4 stars comes down to two things, the terrible hostesses and the coffee. The hostesses here are terrible. I don't think once ever in the 100 times I have visited has one of them ever smiled. It's a shame really.

It was around 10 dollars for their 'stuffed' french toast. Let me tell you what stuffed means to them. It means two slices of toast with some kind of cream cheese filling spread in them. And where does the raspberry come from? The five raspberries they throw on top of it. But I could look past this, I guess, as their way of making stuffed french toast. I surely don't expect something like Ihop, since this is suppose to be 'home cooked meals'. But when your stuffing is so miniscule it's like you spread a small amount of butter on toast, it is very disappointing.\nThen came the omelet with the hash browns. It wasn't great. Not bad. But not medium either. The potatoes were ok, then again you shouldn't be able to mess that up, but the omelet was just....eh, I guess is the only reaction I had to it.

I don't know, something about it seems envigorating, like getting ready for the next week.\n\nWe in Las Vegas have no shortage of breakfast places to indulge at to carry on our day.  The Cracked Egg is located right off of Ann Road, right across the street from the nearby Yogurtland and Walgreens.  Real close to the Centennial area.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has been voted best of Las Vegas on three different years.  So yes, especially on a weekend the restaurant is bustling with patrons needing their morning cup of joe.  The kitchen is hopping, and the smell of bacon and eggs can be quite intoxicating to the senses.  \n\nThe menu at The Cracked Egg is quite diverse, covering a whole realm of breakfast and lunch staples.  Lots of egg dishes (yeah you bodybuiding protein lovers), and lots of fresh ingredients.  You have scrambled egg dishes like the 'North Shore Scramble' which comes with bacon, tomatoes, onions, jack & cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  You have your Eggs Benedict plates, a common staple in most breakfast eateries.  There's breakfast choices like French Toast and pancakes on the ready.  You have your skillets like 'The Chili Skillet' which comes with chili, onions, and cheese.  Seems their big seller is omelettes which they call 'Fluffy & Folded', they crank a lot of these out of the kitchen.  That day we tried 'The Greek' which came with spinach, tomatoes, and feta cheese.  Most dishes come with either seasoned potatoes or hash browns (which I love well done), and your choice of toast or coffee cake.\n\nIn summary, the food is OK.  I mean the omelette was good, the hash browns were good, and the coffee cake was pretty darn tasty.  But I dunno, I just don't see paying around $9 for this.  In fact, a lot of the dishes just seemed a tad overpriced.  Call it the economy, call it inflation, it just seems damn expensive!  Maybe it's because I can see myself at home making a similar dish without much fuss.  I do like how the food looks mostly fresh, and appreciate the cooks since making an egg right is one of the hardest things to do.  \n\nThe service was great, our waiter kept our coffee cups full and our water glasses topped off.  Even on this busy day, which in itself is a feat.  Nice guy, lots of energy, and good with holding multiple plates of food.  A necessary skill!\n\nThe Cracked Egg is also open for lunch, and that menu looked pretty good.  There's sandwiches like 'The Club' with turkey, ham, bacon, swiss, avocado, mayo, lettuce, and tomato on wheat.  Or salads like 'The Cobb' with chicken, bacon, ham, cheese, bleu cheese, avocado, hard boiled egg, tomatoes, and croutons.  I love me a club sandwich so this I may have to try if I ever go back.  They also have burgers too.  Same thing though, almost $10 for a lunch item is a bit high in my book for what you are getting.\n\nThey also have a new gluten free menu for those of you with this sensitivity.  That alone takes a lot of breakfast places out of the running, and having an entire menu for folks with gluten sensitivity probably helps ramp up business a bit. \n\nI like The Cracked Egg but it's not one of the places I think of first when I want a hearty breakfast at a tiny price.  This place borders more on the gourmet side.  I'm happy as a clam with two scoops of hot rice, two eggs over easy, and two slices of SPAM!  So what do I know??"

The seasoned potatoes are good, but could be hotter in my opinion.\n\nThe biggest problem with this place is the service.  After waiting for your table you are greeted by a server who seems entirely overburdened.  There is certainly no passion and for me that kind of ruins things for me.  After I wait 30 minutes for a table, I am excited to sit down and eat.  Having the serve kill that excitement is just disappointing.  Also, this is not the cleanest place I have eaten.  the booths are dirty and the place seems a little dingy.  The toilet was broken... but no one from the restaurant knew... nor when I told them.. did anyone care.  That's sort of how I feel.

I guess its an okay location, but it looks like a place would be fitting for retail stores like Radio Shack or GNC.

When we did get to our booth, we did find it odd that one side is roomy then the other side of the booth. \n\nThe staff seem kind of nice. The one who sat us down in our booth, didn't seem to happy. But the waitress that took our order was upbeat. The busser on the other hand, had issues. I'm sure there are a softer way to put dishes in a bucket, instead of making clanging sounds, to the point where it irritates our ears and makes us twitch every time he drops a plate in the bucket. So that was kind of annoying, either he doesn't know how to be gentle with dishes, or he's not really happy that he has to make the dishes clang and make us twitch. Uncool, unprofessional, and uncalled for. \n\nThe only thing that's making this okay, is the food, the nice setting and the waitress being nice. Otherwise I would of probably experience better if the staff look like they didn't want to work. \n\nThe food on the other hand, I really enjoyed. Had the steak and eggs and cooked to my satisfaction. So I give the cooks a very good recognition as well. \n\nI guess, if you don't mind some of the staff being unhappy and there for the food. Then I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would try something else, if you want to be in a more upbeat kind of place that won't make you feel uncomfortable."

He LOVED the coffee cake which had caramel in it with a thin drizzle of icing on the top.  I wish I had room to try it- it looked yummy!\n\nI would definitely come back here.  I would love to try some of their \"funky\" dishes, if I had someone, err two other people, to share it with!\n\nDid I like it better than Egg Works?

We had a 20 minute wait.\nThe staff was friendly enough, nothing to exceed customer service standards, but met my expectations.(keep in mind I've been the Gm at a national chain restaurant for 10 years). The server greeted us after being seated for 4 minutes. We gave our beverage and food order. Two coffees, 2waters, chille Verde rancheros/seasoned potatoes, big bad wolf omelette w/hashbrowns & SD toast. Drinks came quickly. Coffee tasted like coffee, after all its not a \"coffee shop\". Server came by the table 3 times to warm up our coffee before we received our food. Our order took 22 minutes to reach our table. Acceptable, considering the restaurant volume and the fact that we had ordered\"specialty items\", as opposed to eggs & toast. My chille  Verde rancheros was AMAZING! The pork was tender and juicy, the sauce had excellent flavor. I will be returning for this dish. My husband was hesitant about the omelette due to yelpers reviews. He went for it. The big bad wolf omelette was delicious. It was thoroughly cooked not dry. \nI'll be back, I want to try the country Benedict."

I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.  \n\nWhat was worse, when I went to pay and was asked how my meal was, I was honest.  I got a shrug and an ho hum, oh well.

            "review": "This review is kind a tale of two aspects of the restaurant.  Let's start with the positive - the food (which is what you come here for in the first place).  And it was awesome.  Our group had the breakfast croissant sandwich (with scrambled eggs and ham), the eggs benedict and a short stack of pancakes. Everything was great.  The sandwich had perfectly prepared eggs with melty cheese and flavorful ham.  The croissant was huge and delicious.  Just the right amount of flakiness. The short stack of pancakes were perfectly done and delicious.  As for the benedict, it was awesome.  The hollandaise sauce was excellent, the eggs were perfect.  Just delicious.  With the exception of the short stack, the dishes came with excellent seasoned potatoes.  Easily five-star food and one of the top two breakfast meals we've had since moving here last year. \n\nNow the negative - the service.  Our waitress was really clueless, while drinks were served promptly, after our order was taken the waitress disappeared for like 10 minutes and then came back to tell us she forgot to put the order in.  We got a half-hearted apology, but clearly it amused her too because she giggled throughout.  So she walks over to the machine and starts typing in the order, then has to flee back because she can't read what she wrote down for one of the order.  Our food did come out fairly quickly after that, but she dropped the plates off in a hurry and wandered off before I could even tell her that we had no silver ware. So we had to wait for her to wander back to get that.  I realize that everyone has bad days and mistakes happen, but the sheer volume of screw ups here was unacceptable.  One-star (at best) for the service.  \n\nGiven that great food and abominable service, I'm going to split the difference and give Cracked Egg 3 stars.  I'm sure we will be back at some point, because the food was great, but the service was certainly concerning."

The first time i came here with my sis and the guy, the food AND service was awful. I thought I'd give it another shot and I did-- and I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I should've left when the guy and I walked in and the place only had about 8 patrons including the both of us. We were seated and the lady seemed nice. Scanned the menu and looked at the prices, and it seemed pricier than the other breakfast places. Anyway, to make things short, we were seated, drink orders were taken, lady said she'd give us a couple of minutes--uh, more like forever. She even apologized she said she thought we were still looking at the menus, but really we were looking at our phones(YELPING..). The guy ordered steak and eggs(15 bucks) and I ordered two eggs(over easy) with a side of toast. Again, we waited. Not as long as we did earlier but it seemed like a while. THEN, the food came. Oh wait did I mention they \"don't do medium rare steak orders\" here. And it all made sense. The steak was bad! I mean it stank and it was old! Not to mention the fact that it made my bf sick. I should've told him to stop eating it when I smelled it. Uggh... And then came my eggs....how do you mess up eggs??!?!? Over easy--not sunny side up. Damn it cracked egg...\n\nI really wish we enjoyed this place as much as the others did. But really? I'm probably being  generous right now by giving them two stars. \n I'm not sure if I would come back and try other things on the menu but if I did, it'll be a very long time."

First off, a big wow on that coffee cake-light and sweet and not heavy at all.  Veggie skillet was packed with all of the ingredients- mushroom, peppers, tomatoes, spinach and potatoes. Veggies were almost perfectly cooked, maybe first few bites of the spinach was not cooked enough, but overall it was very enjoyable and filling. The potatoes were spot on.\nService was very good.

Often hit the other locations as well depending on where my day brings me. That's a lot of pancakes.  \n\nAlways been a fan, and sad to say that the poor experiences that I have had most recently actually prompted me to create a yelp account. Normally I would just voice such concerns to the manager, but sad to say I don't really think he would be receptive.  He seems more interested in socializing than he does running this place to the standards set by the other Cracked eggs.  I hope the owner reads this, because i am one of those regulars that would always tell his friends about how good all of these restaurants were.  Not going to happen again.  I speak from experience as a customer, and as an operator. \n\nMy last visit ,  four other tables seated... 10 minutes for a waitress to stop talking to her friends that she was eating with and come take my order.   Another 15 minutes  before the order came out (eggs, bacon, toast, fruit). This has become pretty much a routine occurrence.  Staff- I am not paying to watch you eat and socialize with each other, and your friends that you bring in.  And for life of Gordon Ramsey- don't sit down and eat yourself, then get up, not wash your hands, and then bring me my order when you feel like it-  WITH a mouthful of food!!!  Who does this??\n\nPortion sizes have always been consistent as a rule with this brand. Lately, they seem to vary from huge to tiny.   Food costs must be a treat to chart here.  Flavors always varied, I guess depending on who is cooking as of late.  Cleanliness?  Brush crumb on floor- then step on throughout day.  \n\nOh BTW, the spill on the floor that nobody cleaned up... almost caused me to kill myself. But hey, as long as  the staff have time to text on their phone and update facebook between sitting down to chat with friends...what's one more dead customer right? \n\nNo follow up on refills or up selling on staff's part anymore.  I am sure the owner is glad to know that rather than supervising, the manager generally leaves well before the staff at closing. Seen that at least a half dozen times in the last two months.  No side work, or clean up being done when slow.  Have seen tables take ten minutes to get bused, floors routinely filthy, and bathroom a horse wouldn't use. \n\n3 Visits in the last two weeks. Each one more disappointing than the last.  Staff generally unorganized and disinterested.  A continuous flow of new employee faces over the last few months tells me their is a general leadership problem.  I remember years going by where the same cashiers, busboys , waiters and waitresses were on like clockwork. At my last visit,  I heard one waitress tell another that she wasn't told if she was working  tomorrow????  Wasn't told yet by closing???  Communication is key in hospitality. \n\nAttention to detail no more.  The staff might not care about my $200 or so a month they will be losing in the future, but i am sure the owners might care about the 50 other customers like me who have been noticing the same race to the bottom. \n\nGood Evening...I'm Will McAvoy"

These hash browns would make IHOP hash browns pee their pants in fear. It reminded me of something my grandma from Oklahoma would pull out in the morning, made in a skillet - low on presentation, high on deliciousness and love.\n\nThe wait was manageable if you're an early riser, service was extremely prompt. We received several offers of more coffee, water, milk etc, were asked if everything was good, from many different waiters and our main waiter was smiling, happy, and clearly a kind guy.\n\nWe ended up spending $30, around $15 per person for three drinks and two HUGE platters of food. For the quality and service (and the fact that you're supporting a smaller business) it's worth it."

It's hard to get the waiter's attention for refills. Also, I can't believe they only give military discounts if the member is in uniform. Evidently a government issued ID card isn't enough. We've tried this place several times but from now on I'll drive an extra 15 mins to 'that other egg place in town' where their clever little egg sign allows waiters and waitresses to know when you need something. Oh yeah, and there a military ID card is enough to get a discount anytime."

On my last visit, I tried the GVP omelette, which is served with a choice of potatoes or hash browns, and a choice of toast or coffee cake. The coffee cake arrived piping hot, which seemed like it came right out from the microwave. I couldn't stomach the omelette. Maybe it was the mushrooms and spinach combo, or just too much of the stringy Munster cheese, but it just didn't taste good. \n\nSo long, Cracked Egg.

The omelet had no seasoning on it and was overcooked (dry).  Their \"seasoned potatoes\" are the frozen bagged stuff you can buy in any supermarket, I think I have a bag in my freezer at home.  The coffee was good, except when I asked for a warm up the waiter topped off my cup with cold coffee and made the half cup I already had colder. \nThe service was terrible!

The Croissant French Toast is good as well as their omelets. They have decent prices and good old fashioned comfort food that keeps me coming back. However, I find it quite annoying that most of their dishes don't come with a choice of sausage or bacon and it cost an arm and a leg to order it on the side. Their bacon and sausage on the side costs more than buying it at a grocery store! Seriously, they are cheap meat so I don't see why they charge so much. I like sweet and salty meals. I just can't have one without the other. A girl needs her protein."

I got the coffee cake which was good..I was expecting something denser but it was super light-textured. Another  yelper suspected a cake mix but I bake a lot and it seemed house-made legit. My husband got French toast and eggs...I had a bite of his French toast and it was good. My burrito was excellent...packed with veggies and scrambled eggs and cheese...I was super happy they have green Tabasco too. \n\nSecond visit was with my mom on a weekday morning. We were seated quickly and were soon drinking coffee. We both ordered a special - sweet potato skillet with cranberry sausage and eggs. We also got coffee cake. Like the first time it was super fluffy and had a good flavor but I'll just get toast next time and save some calories for eggs and cheese ;)\n\nSkillets were good...I would have preferred more veggies and fewer sweet potatoes but I am a big veggie fan so take that Into account. I would have also liked something more acidic thrown into the mix so I ended up asking for my fave green tabasco again. \n\nService was good, nice variety and good quality of ingredients. Next time I plan to try lunch.  They offer coupons every month on their website but make sure you check that out before you go as they need to be printed."

After checking my Yelp! bookmarks - I was happy to be reminded of the newer Centennial location of the Cracked Egg as we'd been going to the original Cheyenne location on and off for about 8 years now.\n\nThis location is a lot less crowded with a shorter wait time and a much larger seating area - all decorated in a traditional country-kitsch motif.  I liked the fact that they have enough room to set the tables further apart here, it makes the space feels much more open and airy.  I'm a big fan of the Cracked Egg's Veggie Benny and it was equally as great here.  Two English muffins topped with spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise please - diet be damned!  I prefer my breakfast with hash browns rather than fried potatoes and they do a good job here - taking the time to let the outside get all nice and crispy while the inside remains soft and buttery (if there's one thing that makes me sad, it's undercooked hash browns).  The service was friendly, welcoming and efficient.  I'd definitely come back to this location again, even if it is a little farther from my house - just for the shorter wait."

Served with hash browns and a slice of coffee cake. The scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection and the hash browns were on the crispy side, but still good. A nice dash of Cholula kept things interesting. Think of the coffee cake as more of a sugary pastry. The coffee cake has chunks of Oreo in the loaf and is topped with a sweet icing. It's served warm and in a generous portion size. 4/5 \n\nHAM & EGGS ($7.99): My mom got hers with seasoned potatoes and over easy eggs. This a hearty breakfast for sure! She was very content with her breakfast meal. 4/5\n\nCAKES & EGGS COMBO ($8.99): Two pancakes, two eggs, and two sausage or bacon. My dad was a fan of this combo!

However, that didn't stop my friend who talked to the cashier who grabbed a manager who said yeah she gave you guys $1 off the cost of the toast.

My boyfriend ordered the croissant sandwich and the Mexican skillet and enjoyed both, but wants the country fried steak and gravy next time we go. I definitely recommend it!\n\nThe prices are reasonable for the food you order and the portion sizes are decent. I've never left the restaurant still hungry or too full. We've had no problems as far as service goes with our waitresses being super friendly. There are lots of servers and staff walking around to check on tables and maintain a clean dining room. Both the indoor and the outdoor seating areas are nice to sit in. I recommend the outdoor seating only early in the morning when it's not too hot (this is Las Vegas after all). Also, just a side note, this place does get relatively busy in the morning for breakfast and brunch, so prepare for a short wait, even for the outdoor seating area usually. I expect there is about a 30-45 minute wait during peak hours, so around 10-11:30am."

I ordered the Chili Verde Rancheros and the regular hash browns. I am glad they serve regular hash browns.\n\nThe coffee cake was tasty however, have you ever microwaved coffee cake and it is really hot in the center plus has a feel that screams microwaved? It was kind of like that. I would rather have a piece of warm coffee cake that did not pass through a microwave(just seems like it did).\n\nMy meal was very tasty but the shredded pork in the Rancheros had hard edges like it had been sitting out.\n\nLastly, when we walked in and asked for a booth, the hostess gave us a gas face as if by asking for a booth we were throwing off the table rotation by not taking a two top.\n\nBut...we will be back. If I did not like the place it would get less then 4 stars"

Today I got that chance and this was so mediocre and blah I would have been better off going to McDonald's for a better value and not have to tip a waitress who reminded me of a robot. First off there was enough salt in this food to start my own Salton sea. My measure of how the rest of food is at a new restaurant is the Eggs Benedict so I always try that first...big pet peeve alert....why do restaurants insist on serving crappy powder mix hollandaise ..IT SUCKS.....is it so hard to put in some extra effort to make homemade sauce?..the seasoned potatoes tasted like they were put on a conveyor belt of salt and run thru like 20 times...i paid 2.45 for coffee..and 3.75 for an oj...total rip off..im tired of mediocre crap being pawned off on the public in order to keep the owners of these places from losing money. the waitress was going thru the motions dropped my check before i was even finished,did not ask if i wanted a warm up on my coffee nor a to go cup for my Starbucks costing java...The verdict is more crap service and food for 21 dollars..at least McDonald's is consistent....after i ate this garbage i had to find a bathroom quickly as I got an instant irritable bowel reaction...such a pleasant way to start the day....me thinks not!!"

While not my favorite breakfast place in town, it's probably the one I go to the most because it's the perfect blend of convenience, tasty food and an always friendly staff.\n\nLocation.  Parking right at the restaurant can be difficult.  If you dont strike gold and find a spot in front of the restaurant, just park in the large lot that spans the front of the shopping center facing Charleston Blvd.  Getting into the parking lot is easy, but getting out can be tricky depending on where you're trying to go.  The Charleston - Hualapai intersection can be a challenge.\n\nThe Food.  As mentioned, the food is consistently good.  Over time I've tried all but one of the omelettes (the Carnitas is my favorite), three of the \"scrambles\" (try the Southshore Scramble for something mild, or the Southwest Scramble for a little zing), and three of the Eggs Benedict (the traditional Eggs Benedict is my favorite, with a side of bacon).  They also have amazing salads for a breakfast place.  I've never ventured into the pancakes, french toast or other similar breakfast items because I love eggs for breakfast enough that I never seem to stray away from them.  My wife and friends routinely get these other items though and have never been unhappy.\n\nIf you have a gluten sensitivity, there's a significant menu for you as well, so dive in!\n\nThe Staff.  In the end, the Cracked Egg is a large chain, and there are a number of similar breakfast chains out there.  I've been to a few.  (I might like breakfast.)  Big chain restaurants are..well, big chains and honestly it's hard for me to give them a rating higher than a three.  In fact, I usually don't review them unless they stand out for some reason.  In this case, the staff at this Cracked Egg location is what makes this a four star review.  So go, enjoy the food, and let the staff take care of you."

I've sampled some other things on the menu, but only when my boyfriend orders because I just cannot part from my one true love, the country benny.\n\nI love you, Cracked Egg.  It's an unhealthy obsession, but the tongue and stomach wants what it wants."

Said hold on after asking us so how many?\nI'm like good morning to you too.... \nThere was a cute brown haired girl that has just started... She helped buffer that abrasiveness and was smiling and asked us how our day was going. ... GOOD JOB GIRL! ... I told the front, I think your employee needs a tab bit of training in customer service... As this is summerlin and I just moved here and first impressions are everything! ..... Went and ate at the bar in back... Service was EXCELLeNT and the food was delicious!!!!!! \n\nThe MANAGER delivered our food and apologized... Well Played! Well Played! ...And we chatted for a bit.

They don't offer wifi and this is explained by a sign that says \"we don't have wifi, talk to eachother and pretend it's 1995, an obvious affront to younger more connected individuals who like to multitask while enjoying a morning meal.  \n\nOur server seemed timid though he did well trying to personalize our guest experience.   it could be argued that the entire exchange was awkward and lacking a sunniness that one might find in someone with more experience.  We ordered our food and had to ask for more creamer, even though we placed the empty creamer container on the edge of the table.  \n\nI ordered the low fat scramble and my partner ordered the veggie skillet.  I had the coffee cake as my bread and my partner ordered the sourdough toast.  \n\nThe lowfat scramble was actually delicious.  I would recommend ordering it with no salt.  This is how I ordered it and the dish was delectable!  There was chicken and tortilla chips which were not crispy because they were mixed into the scramble.  Not sure if they were meant to be crispy but it tasted good the way it was served.  The coffee cake was not very good at all.  It was actually a cherry jam coffee cake with white sugar frosting.  I wasn't expecting this for coffee cake in my limited experience is a plain sometimes cinnamon spiced pastry to sweeten your cup of Joe.  I would not recommend the coffee cake unless you are a fan of highly sugary items and cherries.  I am neither.\n\nMy partners skillet was the most lacking of the breakfast experience.  Again, it's hard to know what happened, whether the small differences were by design, the effect of a new or bad cook, or simply just a bad day in the history of the cracked egg.  For instance the seasoned potatoes were cold and seemed pre-made.  They were dark with seasoning even though I requested light seasoning.  The broccoli which came in the skillet was seemingly steamed, but the spinach was not.  So there was a mix of different cooking for all of the ingredients and it was off putting.    Also my toast was cooked fine.  \n\nWe ordered a waffle for the table and it came out soft and light. I wanted it cooked more but I didn't want to bother the waiter.  He asked the table next to us if they wanted their coffee to go, but once he gave us our check, he never once checked on us again.  We asked another of the wait staff if we could have our coffee to go and she brought us huge Styrofoam cups full of coffee.  Not what we asked for.  But still cool.  But a little excessive. But a nice gesture.  So anyways, we got a good experience in the end but not without some effort on our own part which somehow defeats the purpose of \"service\".   \n\nWhen we finally told the hostess who was checking us out, she showed no remorse and offered no apology.  She just handed us our receipt and was over it.  Over all, we felt that the prices we paid did not reflect the quality of experience we received.  Too bad."

Based on Yelp research I chose The Cracked Egg because it has generated some good reviews and was very close to my hotel. My server, Tabitha greeted me with a smile and, very considerately, steered me to a larger table in the nearly empty restaurant. at 6:45 a.m., instead of compelling me to sit at a smaller table as many other places do. She provided the restaurant's extensive menu promptly and simultaneously took my order for coffee. The coffee was good and she diligently re-filled my cup until I cried uncle.I ordered two Blueberry Pancakes after she patiently explained that I had the option of ordering one, two or three, which the menu did not make evident.\n\nThe pancakes, unfortunately, tasted dry and leaden.They were not fluffy and light. They were hard to eat.They could not stand up to the excellent blueberry pancakes that I have had at Blueberry Hill restaurants during prior trips to Vegas. Perhaps the recipe can be tweaked because this is a family, and not a corporate, restaurant?\n\nPrior to my leaving, Tabitha let me know where I could find some much needed cold medicine.It is the combination of her excellent service, the fact that my food experience diverged so much from the majority and the likelihood that I did not order the correct item that explains my decision to award an extra star.These factors would induce me to try The Cracked Egg again if I stay at Red Rock in the future."

What could you possibly be doing that's so important that you really need wifi for anyway? And no. If I'm there trying to enjoy a meal on the patio, I don't want someone's dog there, regardless of breed or size. Unless it's a service dog, why would you expect to bring it everywhere like an accessory? I'm sure they would rather lose the one customer that was butthurt they couldn't bring their animal to breakfast instead of losing three or four customers that would want a dog there. As for the service complaints, there are no complaints from me. I came for a quick breakfast with my mom. Everything came out fast and hot. We were asked if we had everything we need and if we needed anything else, let her know. Then we were left alone to eat and have a conversation without the server coming by every few minutes interrupting us asking if we needed anything. If I we did need anything, we would have gotten her attention and communicated with her instead of rearranging some dishes on the table and hope that she could read our minds that we needed something specific. \nMy mom got a veggie skillet which looked good, but not my type of thing. Plus I was craving their chocolate chip banana pancakes which definitely hit the spot. I also had scrambled eggs and sausage patties which you can't really mess up. If you think the food is bland, there is not much to do about that. It's all about personal preference and restaurants can't please everyone. They aim to please as many as they can, usually. Other places do what they do regardless of people's opinions. But that's usually certain types of food. Overall I've never had a bad experience here, and I would definitely go back. As for the price, meh, not too cheap or expensive. If you say you'd rather go to Mcd's then so be it. That's another case of opinion. Maybe you prefer that peculiar Mcd's flavor that's in all of their products. I'm not sure what that is, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about."

I have been here numerous times, but never again and I will be sure to voice my opinion to everyone i meet.  We went to sit on the patio on a slow day and were told to leave and when we informed them that the dog was a service animal they said they needed proof, He then told them that that they were not allowed to ask for papers, and what kind of service animal he is and  tried to inform them that the 2 questions they were able to ask, \"Is that a servcie dog?\" \"What has he been trained to do?\"  the waitress walked away from us before he could finish..  I WAS SO IRATE AT OUR TREATMENT we decided to go else where to spend our money.  The fact that they have not trained their staff is no excuse.  I am more upset at this than my friend is.  They should take the time to review the Americans with Disabilities Act. Ignorance is no excuse.   The thing I was looking forward to this morning was the fresh coffe cake that they serve, but it is not enough to bring us back, and a fresh doughnut from Krispy Kreams is worth the drive, and they gave my friend some water in a bowl for his service animal as we had our doughnut."

I had the low fat special. Which had chicken, green chilies, red salsa and tortilla chips. It tasted okay but did not look very appetizing on the plate.  It looked like a pinkish mash. The tortilla chips were also mushy. It seemed like they were trying to make a healthier version of chilaquiles, but the execution was so so. Still, it was eatable. My husband had the carnitas omelette which was fine. Our friends two of the skillets and the eggs Benedict. All of which were also fine. The best part of the meal was the coffee cake that they offer as a side. It's served warm with a sugar glaze on top. This place is an okay breakfast option if your favorite place is too packed. I think the wait that we experienced was because this is a new place. The crowds will die down after it's been open a while."

We said okay we'll put her on the other side of the railing. She informed us she didn't think we could do that either. I informed her at other restaurants as long as the dog wasn't in their \"dinning area\" it should be okay. She left to ask the manager. The owner came out.....actually stood in the door way. In a very curt tone informed us I'm not serving you. I don't care what side the dog is on. No apology nor any sound of remorse or empathy in his voice.

When I asked about the corned beef she assured me it was yummy and then went a step further and said if I didn't like it she would bring me something different! A+ customer service for sure. Honey had a \"big bad wolf\" omelette and it was perfect. The corned beef hash skillet was amazing - fresh cut corned beef cooked with the peppers, onions & potatoes. None of the greasy, overseasoning of most breakfast places. I did like the seasoned potatoes better than the hash browns. One of the highlights of this breakfast place was our toast. Pre-buttered, perfectly toasted bread & they had mixed fruit jelly. Truly awesome! If our next trip is this good, it will become a regular spot for us! \n\nEdit: too good to be true. 2nd visit. Our waitress, Natalie,  is awful. Dropped the check before she asked how we are doing. Slow on water refills. It's crowded again, but not too long a wait. Monte Cristo is terrible. Cheese isn't even melted. Both ham and chicken are still cold. I may just be spoiled by better sandwiches I've had other places, but the potatoes are on point. Honey had an omelette again, but the almost $3 up charge for sour cream and bell peppers is saddening. Our birthday girl had plain buttermilk pancakes & she is chomping away. Overall, I'm sad this place didn't live up to our expectations from our last visit & we won't be back any time soon. \n\nGave it some time & gave them another try. This visit was much better. Coffee cake is great (red velvet) & our food was cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Andi, was great! Honey had the green scramble & he really liked it! Lots of veggies & th green sauce is awesome."

The few downsides of it, is I went on a Sunday at 11am and there was about a 30 minute wait for a table.  I don't know why they have such a small location for the business that they do?!   The service is a tad on the slow side, but they do get the orders right, so that's not a big deal.  However, if you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you.  It is in a busy shopping center to begin with, so the parking can be a bit of a challenge.  And it is very loud in there, so it you're looking for a nice quiet brunch place, this also isn't the place for you.   But if you don't mind these issues, the food is definitely worth it!"

We ordered:\n- California omelette: bacon slices wrapped in an omelet with a sliced avocado on top, served with seasoned potatoes and choice of coffee cake or toast\n- Hot Pastrami sandwich on a roll.  There were some bacon slices and cheese.  The seasoned fries were DELICIOUS, very seasoned and tasty.  Crispy, not soggy.\n- Nutella french toast topped with mini marshmallows and graham crackers.  We thought this dish would be too sweet for one person's meal, so we shared.  Right amount of Nutella, it wasn't lacking.  Didn't even need to really dip in syrup bc it was sweet.  Only ate half of it.\n\nService was not the greatest, hence the 1 star deduction.  The coffee cake was never brought out, so we asked the waitress to pack it to-go for us.

The girl behind the register insisted that was the only way they could take it and made me go get it.  So....if someone didn't have an ID with them, had no other means of payment and they had already eaten the food....I bet they would've taken it."

            "review": "I generally like to give small businesses the benefit of the doubt, and tend to write reviews based only on positive experiences, as once can see from my reviews. However, there was one particular aspect of having breakfast here that has induced me to write a very negative review. The food (and the quality of the food for the value) was pretty mediocre, which would normally earn about a 3 star review from me. But my experience with a staff member working the cash register has earned this location something else. After finishing my breakfast, never having dined here before, I was unsure if I was supposed to pay the check to my waitress at the table, or I was expected to carry the check up to the cash register myself to pay. After waiting at the table for 5-10 minutes, I reckoned I should walk the check up to the front counter to pay. Upon reaching the cash register, I asked a young woman in her twenties behind the counter  - \"should I pay here?\" - to which she promptly replied while motioning back toward the rear of the restaurant - \"No, you should pay it back there - in the bathroom.\" Okay, a young aspiring comedienne, not smiling at all, deadpan delivery, got it. I shrugged the comment off, smiled, and proceeded to pay the check. Upon completing the transaction, she once again went for the jugular - \"Next time you come here, pay the check in the bathroom, see how far that gets you.\" Okay, that was a little bit TOO rude, inappropriate, and no longer funny by anyone's standards. While I was driving away, I was a little bit stunned that someone would be so pointedly mean-spirited not once, but twice. I contemplated driving back there and berating this young woman, but decided against it, vowing only never to frequent the restaurant again. Management should absolutely dismiss her. One or two of her fellow women coworkers were within earshot of this whole episode, and likely recall it, should management wish to take action."

They make the most of their space, but it definitely didn't feel cramped in any way.\n\nSERVICE: Average.  Our server was friendly and offered her suggestions when asked.  She was very busy with many tables.  I was a little disappointed when she dropped off the bill without us asking for it, or asking if we were finished with our meal.  But when I needed a box to take my food to go, we had to flag her down.\n\nFOOD:\nThe Enchilada -- Had just the right mixture of ingredients.  The sauce to pepper to tortilla to egg ratios complemented one another exquisitely without overpowering each other.  The hash browns were crispy (at our request) and tasty.  The coffee cake side was warm, sweet and delicious.\n\nCroissant French Toast -- very tasty.  The bread was a little chewier than I'd hoped for but in retrospect, some croissants are chewy so I'm not sure this is avoidable.  The berries were absolutely delectable - fresh and full of flavor.\n\nOverall, we were very satisfied with this experience and would return."

I'd been watching the construction of this restaurant since it is very close to my job and I frequent some of the other businesses in the area.\n\nLuckily, either I visited at a good time of day, or they worked out the initial kinks in service, because I had a lovely experience.  The restaurant is bright and cheerful, with a semi-open kitchen. There are several large booths and tables throughout, as well as patio seating (no dogs allowed, the sign is pretty prominent). \n\nI was seated promptly, my drink order was taken right away, and my server checked on me throughout the meal. I enjoyed my Californian omelette, which was served with a choice of home fries, hash browns, or fruit along with a choice of toast or coffee cake. Next time, I will definitely get the coffee cake, because it looked great. I was able to sample a piece (my friend got the coffee cake), and it was really yummy. Apparently, they have different varieties daily. Prices were reasonable, with most items averaging between $10-$12.\n\nI expect that The Cracked Egg gets really busy on the weekends, and the parking situation was already pretty tight because there are so many other businesses nearby. It is nice having a breakfast/brunch option in Summerlin!"

So with no other outlet than Yelp, here's the letter:\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI live very near the new Cracked Egg restaurant at Charleston and Hualapai. My inquisitive 3-year-old daughter watched with great anticipation as the new \"muffin store\" was being built, and the morning of 4/27/14 I took her there (she was very excited). I would normally bring my wife and 1-year-old son, but my wife was home sick with a cold.\n\nWhat followed was the worst customer service experience of my life. Given the recent opening of the restaurant, wait staff and hostesses were understandably unpracticed and the operation wasn't running as smoothly as I expect it will over time. However, when I complained to the manager about needlessly waiting for 15 minutes after it was our turn to be seated, a man approached me, and with no introduction or conversation, promptly escorted me out the front door (my 3-year-old daughter riding on my hip), and rudely and loudly told me to \"get in my car, leave, and never come back.\" I encouraged him to listen to me, his customer, and he rudely told me \"look around, are you the only one here with an infant?\" \n\nI'm not a loud, large, or scary-looking man; in fact, I'm a 47-year-old, well-respected member of the business community. I serve on two high profile community boards, and own and operate a small, local business. Suffice it to say, I've never been banned from any establishment, and found the whole experience horrifying, especially in light of having my young daughter with me.\n\nThe saddest part of this experience is my 3-year-old daughter now speaks (unsolicited) about the \"bad man at the Cracked Egg who wouldn't let us have pancakes and bacon.\" She shouldn't have to worry about facing hostility at any of our neighborhood establishments. It's shameful.\n\nSincerely,\nJeff G."

I seem to live by tons of these breakfast places however the past few that I've been to have been hard to beat my all time favorite Pancake House! \n\nThis past Sunday as always I treated my mother to Sunday Brunch and told her that we would try a different place. The Cracked Egg was chosen based on the other errands that had to be ran in that area of town. When we pulled up I just knew the wait was going to be ridiculous based on the amount of cars that were parked outside, boy was I wrong! As I sat patiently waiting I couldn't help but notice all these cute little pictures and signs that had some interesting quotes on them. Less than a 10 minute wait we were seated and provided our menus! Customer service here is very good! Every staff member was smiling and greeting us and the whole vibe just seemed to be pleasant. \n\nThe variety of items on the menu is pretty good! There are tons of things I wanted to try but because an omelet was what my taste buds were screaming about I decided on \"The Big Bad Wolf\" Mom ordered \"The Garden Patch\". Who doesn't love cool names for the items they order? Some probably find it cheesy (no pun intended) but I love the creativeness! You get an option of potatoes, toast and coffee cake with any of the omelet's. Since I was already drooling over the previous YELPER's pics of the coffee cake I went with that of course! Something cool that they do is change the flavor of them every so often. Mine just happened to be apple! Yum! When our food arrived everything looked and tasted great! I had to give them a couple extra brownie points for nailing my request for egg whites on the omelet! Majority places NEVER get it correct and I always have to end up sending it back. Can't be trying to kill me with all that cholesterol! \n\nCheck out was great! Our cashier was friendly just like everyone else we encountered that morning! Asked how our dining experience was and even welcomed us back as soon as possible! I noticed as I was paying for our breakfast that they have a rewards program and when I fill this form out I could get $8 off the next breakfast! I can't wait to return! Awesome job guys!"

I sat down and ordered right away. \n- Not a good price to food ratio. \n- A biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, 2 pooched eggs and smothered in gravy\n- Choice of seasoned potatoes or hash browns. I got the hash browns. \n- I guess I was expecting something better than Wicked Spoon's Egg benedict.\n- Tasted good, but not great. Enjoyed the gravy, but I think it made it all gooey. But I guess that's the country style. \n- Better with hot sauce! \n- This place is a good alternative if you don't feel like going to Babystacks or HashHouse."

This restaurant is in North Las Vegas but just a 15 -20 minute ride from the Strip depending which end you coming from.\n\nGreat decor and extra clean restaurant. Lately I have found restaurants with many decorations and fixtures do not dust appropriately! The menu is unique which I like a lot! \n\nMy husband had the monte cristo with hashbrowns and it met his expectations- and he has a pretty high bar. I had the bacon cheeseburger scramble with egg whites and it was delicious! The coffee cake was some kind of sinful pumpkin flavor and came out warm. Service was excellent- just enough attention but not annoying. Will go back again!\n\nWell deserved Zagat ratings and Best of Las Vegas awards!"

I ordered Joe's scramble and my buddy ordered an omelet.   Both were really good with large portions.   One thing they do at the Cracked Egg is to add cream cheese to the eggs to make them a little smoother and richer.  It's a nice touch if you like cream cheese.   The only complaint I have is they forgot our toast.   But the portions were so large, we really didn't miss the toast.

So far, everything I have tried has been tasty and have not been disappointed one bit.\n\nThey also have a membership program that you can sign up for free.  Once you are in the system, they will send you an $8 off coupon every month.  The coupon has no rules except you have to come in, simple as that.  So sign up for the club and start getting coupons.  The club also gives you a $10 off check for every $250 you spend.  Don't you just love coupons?\n\nWith tons of variety so that everyone in your group can find something to eat, makes the Cracked Egg a great place to visit!

It came with seasoned potatoes and I ordered avocado on the side. It was good as always especially on top of the buttered sourdough bread. The seasoned potatoes also had a good flavor and they were not salty. \n\nMy husband ordered a Tuna Salad sandwich with a side of fries. They accidentally gave him fresh fruit but when they found out their mistake they also gave him  his fries. I had a bite of the sandwich and the tuna was really good it had a \"zing\" to the taste. \n\nI like the location of this Cracked Egg because it's inside a little mini food court that has a Starbucks, Subway, Gyro, and Pizza place. It has something for everyone just in case you are with people with different tastes you can all eat together in their outdoor seating area."

I ordered the Tropical French toast, two pieces of bread dipped in egg, coated with some toasted coconut and macadamia nuts, and nicely grilled.  \n\nI sat at the counter and the place was quite busy.  Maybe it just seemed that way because no one was eating outside because it was RAINING!  \n\nService was very quick and everyone was pleasant and had a nice smile.  I only had one cup of coffee but I was asked about a refill.  I was giving platelets later and I didn't want to be sitting the hour and a half in the chair when the coffee want to leave me.  Also, thanks to the restaurant for having a half order as an option.  That was just enough!\n\nOne thing that would really make this breakfast tropical would be to replace the maple syrup with coconut syrup.  Now that's tropical!"

I noticed most of them had an assembly line going on. Someone specifically cutting the bread there. Putting things in and out of microwaves. Their pumpkin bread cake. Pancakes even microwaved. I probably could have made the same quality of food in my kitchen. It's just goes to show if you have a market and your in there at the right place, at the right time."

We were seated pretty quickly...the place was full.  I decided to be different and order the corn beef hash.  Usually I go for the boring eggs and potatoes but I was going all out that day.  The portion was massive.  Alot of onions...like more than the corn beef but I just ate around them.  It came with eggs (egg beaters) potatoes on the side and wheat toast.  Whew it was alot and by alot I mean ALOT!  When I was done she asked if I liked it because it didnt look like I ate anything. haha  It was pretty darn good though.   I probably would get it again.  \n\nThe BF ordered the kickin potatoes and the crumb cake.  Kickin potatoes are always solid...a combo of potatoes, bacon, cheese, salsa and sour cream (I think thats whats in it)   He loves them.  Now the crumb cake....amazing as usual.  Sometimes they come in different flavors but this time it was just plain cinnamon-just the way I like.  It was so hot when it came out that it was steaming.  the cake just fell apart as you tried to cut through it.  Just the little things.\n\nCracked Egg is always a solid local find.  There arent too many breakfast places that are not chain restaurants that I can say live up to the breakfast standards but this one surely does!"

The second time I went was on a Saturday morning, which meant waiting for 45 minutes for a table. That time I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was very satisfying. It was a large piece of steak and had the nice crispy crust that I like. The gravy was rich and smooth, not chalky like some tend to be. My Mother-in-law ordered the french toast and loved it. \n\nI really like this place, it's just too long of a wait and a little overpriced."

While there is a 30 min wait across the street at Babystacks, we are welcomed on a Sunday morning with the option of dining indoors or out! \nThe coffee is strong, the service is great, and the food comes out pretty quickly and hot! \nI love that there are not so classis breakfast options with peppers and chilies. A huge variety of omelets, and of course some basic eggs and bacon as well. \nOn my most recent visit, I went with the special on the board which was a fried French toast with berries. Literally, the BEST French toast I ever had! I devoured all 4 thick sliced and was STUFFED! \nMy daughter got one of the specialty French toasts on the menus, and hers came with 6 slices. Not sure what the difference was, maybe because mine was the special. Either way I am not complaining at all, both were excellent! \nI feel like the staff has all been here for a while, and they got it down well! I also love that some of the dishes are names based on the surrounding neighborhoods. (North shore/South shore etc) \nThe d\u00e9cor, reminds me of someone's grandmothers kitchen. I love the sign that says, \"We have no Wifi, pretend it's 1995 and talk to each other\". \nDelicious, home-style cooking in a neighborhood setting, perfect for everyone!"

You're not closed yet so don't act like you are. \"Shit where are the bussers\" is what one guy said in response to most the booths needing to be bussed. We watched staff eating then handling fresh food without washing their hands. I'm in the industry... That is a basic guideline to not spreading your germs. I'm not looking for 5 star service but just some professionalism. One girl literally was spinning a coin on the counter the entire time and then dropping it on the floor over and over.

The other thing that's really awesome about this place is that they pay attention to small details. \n\nIf your order something that comes with salsa they make sure to heat it up for you so your eggs/breakfast won't get cold. And when you order bread without butter they don't make the mistake of putting it on there.\n\nAnother thing that I absolutely love is that they offer Gluten free bread or muffins if you can't have gluten, which is the case for me.\n\nAnd every time I've been here I've never had a problem with service. Every waitress is friendly, fast and efficient.

Here's the deal: I have loved Monte Cristo sandwiches since I was a kid, not that I eat them much, but when I do I really enjoy them. For those who don't know, a Monte Cristo is a turkey, ham, and swiss on french toast, fried so the cheese is melted. The Cracked Egg's version is battered and then deep fried. It is so rich and sinful, but, my god, it is delicious. The bacon on the side was also excellent and cooked to perfection. My wife had scrambled eggs, sausage links and toast, all excellent. It's a bit pricey for a breakfast place, but you definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommend. This was the Cheyenne location, I have no idea how the others are."

The tortilla chips were missing as was the green chili the menu promised. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was a pre frozen mystery meat  Pattie with gravy that he said was just ok.

That says a lot, in my opinion.\n\nMost of the food is very, very good, but I want to start things off by mentioning the one dish that caused me to drop this from a 5 to a 4 star review: the coffee cake. I'm not really a big cake fan, but after reading all of the glowing reviews, I decided to give theirs a shot. Any quality it might of had was instantly and unforgivably overridden by that distinct, tell-tale taste and texture of a microwave! What the hell? A microwave? Yeah, sure, that's the kind of taste-deadening, corner-cutting, smoke & mirrors crap people expect from a Taco Bell, but not at a place like this. It was really disappointing and, being the first dish out, a rather disheartening first-impression too. I've read people's reviews, where they talk about how \"steamy\" and \"fresh\" it is, but the steam is artificial and the \"fresh\" appearance is completely false. At least to anyone clever enough to understand that, unless you time things unnaturally well, no cake is likely to ever be served \"steaming fresh\" at a restaurant, that is. Considering how good and legitimately-fresh the rest of the food is, this approach really, REALLY baffles me. Trust me, guys, your cake would be so much better if you a) cooked several batches a day or b) just left it room temperature and honest. Microwaving your food is flat-out insulting to your business and your customers. I thoroughly enjoyed both of my meals, but I wouldn't step in that cake again. Really disgusting bullshit! Get it together!\n\nBeyond that, everything else tasted fantastic (thus the 4 stars)! I simply detest eggs, so I order my meals without. Yesterday, I had the \"Mexican skillet\" and, boy howdy, it was great! The chorizo and salsa were an awesome compliment to the already phenomenal potatoes. I see myself having this same dish again quite soon. Today, I had the country fried steak and it was, honestly, one of the best I've ever eaten. The steak was tender and juicy and the breading was crisp and well-seasoned. Really, really good stuff. I will also be having it again soon. My wife had the biscuits and gravy, which she said was really good, but not quite the way she likes them. Then again, she apparently had that particular bar set quite high when she was younger. She also had the huevos rancheros, which she said was excellent. \n\nAlso, both days, the staff was quite friendly and helpful, though I do wish people/servers would understand that \"water\" doesn't mean \"water with lemon\". I know this is apparently standard practice at many restaurants, but I personally think that, if someone orders just \"water\", you should probably ask if they want a strong-flavored fruit wedge submerged in it before just automatically adding it. Maybe that's just us, but much like with every other single aspect of my dining experiences, If I don't specifically ask for something, I DO NOT want it. Simple enough?\n\nWith all of that being said, there really isn't any question about us being repeat customers here. There are some problems, but the staff is pretty friendly and most of the food is absolutely phenomenal."

My turkey sausage was really dry, and I do wish my hash browns was cooked more, no crispness or browning on the hash brown. It was a bit depressing. I still ate it all because I was hungry. \n\nBreakfast is so simple to cook, how could you not know how to hit all the right points on it.

The place is awesome tho. Looks like a big kitchen."

Come here for great conversation with your friends or family. Put down the phone and get off Facebook cause there's no wifi. Enjoy your food! You'll be happy you did.

No...but for the price it's as good as you'll get in Las Vegas.  \nThe pancakes are nice and fluffy without the pasty feel and floury taste you get at other places.  French toast has a nice crispy outside and fluffy inside.  Omelettes and eggs are cooked really well.  Sausage and bacon are really flavorful...not just salty.\nIf I didn't end up eating so much there I'd go more.  Highly recommended."

You have the option of coffee cake in lieu of toast.... But it's basically angel food cake with apples in it, so I'm not sure what's exciting about that. Two people in my party excitedly ordered the corned beef hash and neither were excited about or finished their plate. I had the sweet potato and apple skillet which would've had potential if it were a) seasoned even a little b) someone had enough knife skills to properly dice an onion. I really don't need an apple-slice sized piece of caramelized onion. Lastly, the Munster cheese melted on the top just turned into a congealed mess before it even made it to the table.\n1 star for pleasant service, 1 star for perfectly\nPoached eggs."

We chose sunny side up eggs and the runny yolk was rich and delicious with the sandwich. We also chose the sausage patty and a side of soggy hash browns - I'm thinking of asking them to make them well done and crispier next time. Overall I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple, but everything combined made for a great (expensive) breakfast sandwich. 4/5\n\n\nCakes & Eggs Combo - $8.50 I chose sunny side up eggs (comes with 2), bacon (comes with 2), and substituted the regular pancakes (comes with 2) with the Coconut macadamia pancakes (comes with 2) - bad decision.\n\nThe sunny side eggs were fried to perfection - both eggs had an extremely luscious and runny yolk. The eggs were very sweet and fresh. I wish the bacon was crispy, it was rather soggy. 3/5 \n\nNow onto the pancakes, they had an extra cost to substitute them ($1.50 or so) for the coconut macadamia pancakes. So not worth it! Although the pancakes were fluffy, they were also very dry. The pancakes had the faintest coconut flavor (actually, I barely tasted it) the \"coconut flavor\" was more like a prank. It did have dry coconut flakes, which was not texturally pleasing and only 7 small pieces of macadamia nuts throughout the entire pancake! It sounded better on paper than what was actually brought to the table. I wasn't satisfied or happy with these pancakes - they were a lie. 1/5\n\nIt was pricey for what we ended up getting. My favorites were their sunny side up eggs and the sausage. You can get that anywhere!"

            "review": "What is with the residents of Las Vegas? Do they actually LIKE to pay good money for a mediocre Breakfast? \n\nOn the menu...\n\nJoe's Scramble (** $9.75) Three Eggs scrambled with seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions, and Jack and Cheddar Cheese.\n\nBefore arriving here, I performed my due diligence and read the many positive reviews on Yelp, and how the Scrambles were described as \"HUGE\" (not my description...) or \"Hearty\". \n\nI was really disappointed when I saw my \"Joe's Scramble\" heading towards me... The Scramble part of the meal only took up a third of the eight inch plate... the rest of the space taken up by what the restaurant described as Seasoned Potatoes... and, BTW, the portion of Potatoes were not HUGE, either. \n\nI always felt that a restaurant should name an Entree what the primary flavor that the Diner would taste first... and in this particular case... it's the huge amount of Cheese that is layered over the Scramble. A LOT of Jack and Cheddar. This entree is a Cheese Scramble, for sure.\n\nIt would take a Forensic Scientist to even find the Ground Beef or the Spinach! And in this particular entree... I really felt that the meat was not all Ground Beef... Tasted like Beef and some other kind of meat.\n\nThe Country Potatoes (*** 1/2) was pretty good, but very small portions. Do you know how a Scrabble (the word game) Tile is shaped? That's the size of each chopped Potato with Seasoned Salt added during frying.\n\nCoffee Cake (*** included with meal) Very sweet... But, I have to ask... When did a Coffee Cake have a Jelly Filling?  This really surprised me... never, ever had a Jelly filled Coffee Cake before.\n\nCoffee (*** 1/2 $2.00) Unlimited re-fills.\n\nAnd then... I received the Bill... Over $41... My mouth dropped in amazement! I looked at what I ordered... the two people that accompanied me (my youngest son and his future father-in-law) and what they ordered. With the tip included... this is as close to a $50 meal as you can get! And, take my word, this is NOT a $50 buck meal! No way, no how!\n\nI asked my youngest, who ordered the Homemade Ground Beef Hash ($10.95) how he liked his Breakfast... He said the Mary Kitchen Hash found at Supermarkets was better than Hash in his meal (and, BTW, he's a Chef!). His comments are not part of the eventual rating...\n\nThe Future In-Law had The Cracked Croissant ($10.25)... No comments from that side of the family... I stated that the next time he would visit the \"Big Valley\", that I'd take him to some 5-Star Breakfast places vastly superior to the Cracked Egg... and some that served authentic Joe's Specials. For the rest of you... just search my reviews for Joe's Specials...\n\nApologies to present and future Family Members for dragging them here...\n\nTo aid this restaurant... here is a recipe for Joe's Special I researched on the Internet... notice how much MORE Beef there is... and the amount of Spinach... hint, hint..\n\nJoe's Special\n\n2T Olive or Vegetable Oil\n2lb lean Ground Beef\n2 medium Onions, finely chopped\n2 Garlic Cloves, finely minced\n1/2lb sliced mushrooms\n1 1/4t Salt\n1/4t ground Nutmeg\n1/4t dry Oregano\n1/4t Pepper\n1/2lb Spinach, rinsed, stems removed, and leaves chopped (about 4 cups)\n4-6 lg Eggs, lightly beaten\n\n1 Heat oil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Crumble in beef and cook, stirring often, until browned. Drain excess fat.\n2 Add onions, garlic and mushrooms; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes.\n3 Stir in salt, nutmeg, pepper, oregano and spinach; cook for about 5 more minutes. Add eggs. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, just until eggs are softly set. \n\nNow... I ask you... doesn't this read good?"

And I love, love, love eggs!  It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!\n\nThe Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  \n\nThe day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \"Breanne's Basics\" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \"Eggs With Attitude\" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \"The Benedicts\" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \"Fluffy & Folded\" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \"Sin City Skillets\" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \"From the Griddle\" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!"

Service was friendly and food was greasy fantastic!\n\nI didn't sample the other peoples food, but what I got was enough to leave a greasy happy grin on my face.  mmmmmm *dreamy food coma\n\n- Coffee Cake - This came out warm, fluffy and super sweet.  Good for a hungry girl to scarf almost all of it down\n\nThen came....\n- Cracked Egg Croissant - I had all the components that my texture whore self loves!  Melty cheese, gooey egg yolk, crispy BACON!, flaky AND toasty croissant.  The side of crispy nuggets of seasoned potato cubes rounded it out.\n\nConclusion:  If you can't wait for the red velvet pancakes up the street, Cracked Egg is the place to go!"

The service was great, with someone taking our drink orders right away and the waitress following up soon thereafter. The menu covers the basics -- omelets, scrambles, skillets and griddle items -- with everything customizable to your liking.\n\nOur drinks came out promptly, and so did the coffee cake that came with my girlfriend's scramble. You'll read about this coffee cake in other Yelpers' reviews, and with good reason: It's warm, soft, slightly gooey, and positively designed to make you crave coffee, as good coffee cake should.\n\nThe rest of our food was made perfectly to order, and while not the greatest food ever, definitely solid. The seasoned potatoes could have been a bit more seasoned, but then again, I compare all to the Egg & I's potatoes, so ... sorry, Cracked Egg. ;) Our water and coffee were kept filled and our check came promptly.\n\nBecause I live on the opposite side of the valley from the Cracked Egg, I probably wouldn't seek it out again (as other comparable venues such as Eggworks are closer), but if I was in the neighborhood one morning? Sure!"

Their eggs were to order and seasoned in the right fashion. \n\nA few notable items on their menu is the monte cristo which is a battered sandwich with cheese and ham. The eggs benedict's are a sure heart attack full of flavor waiting to be savored. Egg sandwiches, biscuits and gravy and specialty pancakes are also a must here. \nIf your feeling for something light, the fresh fruit is very fresh and ripe for the asking.\n\nThis place also does lunch serving breakfast and lunchtime sandwiches."

Of the places I've tried so far in Vegas, this was the best eggs benny I'd had... even better the Wynn's buffet.\n\nThe service was cordial, but not overly fussy. The coffee was good and even though we were seated by the bathroom/kitchen area, it wasn't really a bother.

Sweet potatoes, green apples, muenster cheese, ham, grilled onions & an egg over easy to top it off, with a side of coffee cake as well. \n\nIt was pretty good, considering the sweet potatoes could've been seasoned a little better, nothing a lil hot sauce couldn't fix though ;) I would probably order it again.

I particularly love breakfast when someone else makes it for me - enter diner breakfasts!\n\nWe've been going to this location of the Cracked Egg sporadically for nearly 10 years now.  I started off always having their solid eggs and turkey sausage plate, but now that my diet is more plant strong these days, this time I opted for the Veggie Skillet - and I'm sooooo glad I did!  Fresh broccoli, mushrooms and spinach sauteed and served over the Cracked Egg's signature seasoned potatoes - topped with two eggs over easy. I requested no cheese - and didn't miss it at all.  So fresh and so good!  \n\nOne thing I was happy to see was that the wait was much shorter than I remember for a Sunday - about 10 minutes. I have a feeling that's due to more breakfast options opening in the area.   We tried to go to Babycakes but they had an hour and fifteen minute wait!  Bad for fans of Babycakes, good for fans of the Cracked Egg!"

Because I joined their Roaylty Rewards program last year and am such a regular, I get an $8 gift certificate in the mail every month to spend.  Armed with this month's certificate and famished from a long swim workout, my recovery breakfast this morning was the Garden Patch omelet, hash browns, and the coffee cake--oh yeah!  If you order the coffee cake instead of toast, it will be brought to you first, like an appetizer, but I saved it for dessert--yes, you can have dessert at breakfast!  Customer service has always been top-notch and I've never had a bad meal yet.  And, with my certificate, I only had to pay $5 for my meal, including the tip.  Thank you and keep cracking those eggs!"

They lost a step somewhere, or I would give them a 5star here, but I do love the food, its super breakfast filler, 4stars is recommended, service is stellar, sometimes a wait on weekends, but not more that 20 min.   I like the benedicts, and the griddle meals and omelets.  Heck the Oatmeal is good.   $10 a head.   4star reliability, simple old time breakfast with spices and fresh oj and coffee."

I began to squeal and jump up and down when they handed me an ENTIRE gluten fee menu to choose from!!!  I got the garden omelet and it was delicious. They also offer gluten free pancakes!!   The only thing I hope they get in the future is gluten free bread so that I can enjoy some toast or one of their yummy sandwiches.  :)\nThank you Cracked Egg!!!"

The server was nice but the only time we saw her was when she took our order and gave us our food. If she had returned she would have known that the coffee cake she gave us was heated to the point that both my partner and I burned the tops of our mouths on it. \n\nThe food was OK, nothing to really write home about. I had their \"Homemade Corned Beef Hash\". As the stars describe it \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" I have actually had better food at the Cracked Egg up on Ann Rd. I think I'll stick to that one."

Up popped Cracked Egg.  We were already in the area anyways, and reading all the great reviews, we decided to head on down.  \n\nMuch shorter wait ... about 5 minutes.  Still nice and busy.  Kind of a random strip mall to be located in - almost industrial looking ... but then again, considering it seemed most of the restaurants outside the strip seemed to be in this kind of environment, I think that's just how Vegas rolls? \n\nAmbiance inside was nice, however, and the servers were super sweet and helpful.  The three of us girls were starving so after a thorough gander through the menu, my friend ordered the Veggie Benny (Vegetarian Benedict since she hates Canadian bacon), I ordered the Country Benny (because my fat arse really wanted some gravy), and my other friend ordered the Croissant French Toast.  Got to choose from either hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  My friend asked the server if they made their own hash browns or if they came from the frozen industrial stuff.  Unfortunately it came from the frozen variety, so we opted for the seasoned potatoes.  Luckily, the seasoned potatoes are delicious - so no sacrifice there!  We also ordered ourselves some orange juice and coffee.  Came with your typical diner - accompaniments (half & half creamers and sugar).  Considering all the crap that's in that weird half & half, we decided to ask her for some milk, instead, and luckily, she was super cool about it :)  \n\nMy country benny was very good...super fulfilling, too.  Wish the gravy were just a tad more flavorful - it was a bit bland for country-style gravy, but hey..I'm a gravy sucka and as long as it was smothered on my biscuit and sausage, I was still a happy girl.  All in all, I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to eat here again, but would definitely not be against it if we happened to find ourselves out round these parts."
