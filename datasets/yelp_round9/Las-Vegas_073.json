            "review": "I came here with a friend for the $12 AYCE wings on a Monday. The wings aren't the best I've had, but they were good enough for the value. There's an option between buffalo and regular sauce. I liked both. \n\nAYCE wings- 3.5 stars. \nBaked Ricotta (truffle honey and black pepper) - 4 stars.  The honey was yummy, but I didn't like the baked ricotta very much. Maybe brie would have been better. \n\nThis place had other great items on the menu, that I would come back to try. It's a nice, posh place, and has a cool vibe to it. Service was excellent!"

            "review": "I don't quite understand this place.   I couldn't figure out the theme, the decor, the music - nothing.  I ordered the Kale Caesar Salad that was described as having cheese, croutons, and garlic lemon dressing.  When I took the first bite,  it tasted like straight anchovies.  I know that CLASSIC Caesar salad dressing has anchovies.   However,  the menu didn't say anything about it being a classic Caesar salad nor that the dressing was classic.  I sent it back and ordered the onion soup.  It smelled like something died in my bowl.  Disgusting.  I ordered the shank steak and it was actually pretty good, however, the steak fries had some creamy drizzle on it and was not good.  My husband ordered the Sea Bass and it was horrible. The service sucked,  too.  The outside of this restaurant boasts it to be a fine dining establishment especially when you look at the prices.  Yet, when I walked in,  I couldn't figure out why they had big screen televisions playing basketball and the music was flashback to the 90s.  I was subjected to listening to Alanis Morissette's \"You Oughtta Know\" and \"Zombie\" by The Cranberries while trying to eat.   Is this fine dining, a sports bar, a steakhouse, what??  Everything about this place confused me.  I'm sure it will be closing in the next few months since the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night.  Don't waste your time or money."

He constantly ignored us and always had an attitude. However, the runners and hostess were great. \n\nFor being at Red Rock, I expected more. Sure, every table probably ordered wings, but it felt like he judged our table for being young and cheap. This place should learn to cater to all different types of demographics. There's nothing worse than bad customer service."

I wanted to check this place out on our several past visits to Red Rock resort but never made it. \n\nThe bar was packed, which is good for business. They have lounge like communal seating; made me feel like I was just hanging at home or at a friend's house. The decor is cool as well. And I loved all of the TVs, no matter where you were seated you could catch all the action. \n\nThey have plenty of beers and cocktails to choose from. I wanted to try some food here but we were headed to dinner at T-Bones. Everything looked appetizing on the menu. \n\nOur service was excellent. Jazmin was awesome! She was on her game, going around the bar area to make sure all of the patrons were good to go. She made some good recommendations for my wife's drinks. I kept it simple and went with some Stellas. Thanks, Jazmin for being so nice to us. We always appreciate good service. \n\nWe will have to try dinner here on our next visit. Good spot for happy hour. Happy drinking!"

However this place seems over priced for the quality food. The baked ricotta pot is good, the tuna is good but nothing that wows you. I'd much rather go to Joes Stone Crab for the same cost but with way better service and quality of food."

            "review": "Hearthstone is located in Red Rock Casino which is so close to my new place so I was excited to try it out. We came with a larger group for cinco de mayo and actually planned on going to Mercadito, but Mercadito was slammed so we went next door instead. \n\nHearthstone is gorgeous!! Totally my scene, with big comfortable chairs and great ambiance. We decided to sit outside because it was such a nice day. I can totally imagine going there on a warm Vegas night and sitting outside enjoying myself. We had dinner reservations late on the strip so we just wanted to order a few apps and a couple drinks. However, I loved the variety of unique food options. They have flatbreads, jams, but some heftier dishes, as well.\n\nI ordered a sparking sangria on drink special. It was very tasty, but at $12 it was less of a special and more of cocktail-on-the-strip prices. I also had just got the sparkling sangria a few days before at Kona Grill which was twice as good at a quarter of the price. I got the parmesan/truffle popcorn and the mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was just ok. I prefer stronger flavors and it was somewhat bland. However, the popcorn was so yummy and it was a large portion, enough to share with an entire table. I also enjoyed their presentation of the food on their menus. The service was attentive and friendly and the prices were somewhat high, but you have to remember that it is a casino restaurant. \n\nI can't wait to come back with the girls for happy hour. Such a gorgeous place!"

            "review": "No problems with my 6:45 reservation, restaurant is nice, decor is inviting yet casual. Service was ok: server was good but timing of courses was off. Main course arrived before salads, which (salads) seem to be a bottleneck. The salads were slow coming out, granted they were tasty and fresh. Timing issues must be solved quickly or it will become chaos for guests.\n\nBiggest opportunity is the portion size vs the price. Either the entrees are overpriced or the portions are too small, one of those two has to change to succeed. The shrimp pasta entree is a ridiculously small portion at that price. There is too much competition in Red Rock and with Wolfgang Puck and Crave in Downtown Summerlin, small portions could be a show stopper.\n\nI give it a 3 star to start but it certainly has the potential to improve and we will go back. \n\nManager came to our table to apologize for the salads and bought us drinks and credited the salads. Nice but it's better and cheaper for them to solve those problems."

But the setting for everything else is not a sports bar! It has a very nice classy relaxing feel, but the tv's are horrible. Our waiter started out great, but them as after 10 mins of when I asked to have food boxed up and my husband had left to get the car and my wallet is in the table he comes by to refill my water and ask if I wanted dessert, it takes another 5 mins for the box and our check. What was really neat is they brought out a small cooked pig and prepped it in the dining room for the people in the lounge. I would return knowing what to expect, and still think the tv's should not be there."

Your entree does not come with a side so on top of the $30-$40 entree you are paying $7 for a side dish.  Although I can appreciate the concept, I wont run back to eat here in the near future.  I ordered the short rib, it was very tender and flavorful but again I cant justify the $30 price tag when I've been to other restaurants who offer short rib dishes with choice of sides for less money.  I typically do not base my reviews on prices as I appreciate quality but these portions were almost appetizer size."

The restaurant setting was very comfortable with leather lounge sofas, bar seating, wooden tables and booths. It had a modern, yet rustic feel. Modern rustic perhaps? Great interior design. And 80s music playing in the background. Also a ton of TVs. We had 2 servers. Both were pleasant, knowledgable about the menu, and were always accessible. Excellent service. The food: we ordered a couple of shared plates...ricotta bake with honey, wild arugula salad, and lobster polenta. Oh man, the lobster polenta was so creamy. AmaZing. I also ordered the entree Rotisserie Chicken with arugula salad. It was tender and moist and had great taste. For dessert we shared the Peanut Butter scotch Lava Cake. Wow! I'm full. Good job Hearthstone. We love Red Rock and most certainly will be back for more."

That being said I've seen some of the reviews about Hearthstone and I disagree with most. I was in this past weekend for the 2nd time and yes I will agree that some of the food is overpriced, but my wife and I enjoy the environment and have had great service BOTH times. I think the food sometimes does take a bit long but the place is huge and I'm not in any hurry otherwise I'd go to the food court lol. I cant remember who served us the first time but Ryan took care of us last, he was amazing and we basically went with most of his suggestions, we had:\n\nStuffed Dates which were so good\nQuinoa Salad was delicious \nA few other things and then we had the special NY steak that was on their board. He told us we would love it and he was right! \n\nEverything we've had has been pretty great, a few things weren't my favorite but hey thats at ANY restaurant. Oh and definitely try the Lava Cake! Best part of the meal!! A manager even came by at some point to check on us, so I dont know what some of these people are talking about. Bussers and everyone was great. We'll definitely be back to see Ryan and the other staff"

            "review": "I made a reservation via OpenTable; simple as always. Six of us got together (my friends like to call us the \"Supper Club\") and shared everything. I'd highly recommend a group because it worked out so nicely. The space is beautiful with a great vibe. However, all of us thought it was a bit loud as we had to yell at each other to have conversation. \n\nOur server, Tien was FABULOUS! She was the epitome of the perfect server. She was very welcoming. Since we were all first-timers, she explained the menu, made food suggestions, and made sure we knew how much food was in each dish so we had enough for everyone. We really felt like she was looking out for us. She was present throughout our meal and even bought us two of their most popular desserts! As we were leaving, she offered to take a photo of our group as well. Tien went above and beyond her duties and made it a truly wonderful evening! Ask for her and you won't be disappointed!!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed our meal. There were a few stand-out dishes that I would love to eat again. There were also items that warranted shrugs, however, I'm intrigued enough by what did well to want to try the rest of the menu. \n\nDeviled Eggs ($9): Pimento cheese, whipped yolks, and Schmaltz mayo. Three to an order. These were good, but didn't taste particularly different from every other deviled egg I've had as of late. \n\nCharred Octopus ($18): Smoked potatoes, rocket, and chorizo a\u00efoli. Fantastic octopus; well prepared. I loved the addiction of capers. The potatoes were nice as well.\n\nFG&J ($18): Foie gras mousse, Virginia peanuts, and housemade jelly. Very yummy! The mousse had a wonderful flavor and was very smooth. Great with the jelly on their delicious grilled bread.\n\nBaked Ricotta ($16): Truffle honey, black pepper, and gouda. This was definitely a favorite at our table. The ricotta was delicious! I loved the caramelization on top of the cheese and the side of truffle honey was a wonderful complement. Amazing with or without their bread.\n\nMushroom Flatbread ($20): Fromage blanc and gouda. A mushroom \"pizza\" with some truffle element. Nice crust. Nothing spectacular about this dish for me. Perhaps a different flatbread selection might wow me?\n\nWhole Roasted Pig Rilette ($7): YUM. I liked that this rilette was a little meatier and the flavors were fantastic! I could eat this ALL DAY (I love rilette!).\n\nBone Marrow ($12): This was also good, but it didn't have any stand-out flavors. It was just plain ol' bone marrow. I didn't go back for a second bite.\n\nPeanut Butter Lava Cake ($9): Butterscotch and Roasted Banana Brown Butter ice cream. The cake didn't interest me, but the ice cream was nice!\n\nButterscotch Pudding ($9): This was FANTASTIC. So yummy!! We couldn't get enough of it! And that Cookie Butter Crunch in it? Amazing. Home run.\n\nHoney Olive Oil Cake ($9): This beautiful olive oil cake is drizzled (slightly drenched, but I'm not complaining) with honey and served with Blood Orange Sherbet and orange segments. SO GREAT! I absolutely loved this dessert. I may have loved it more than the pudding."

I looked over the Hearthstone menu and saw the entr\u00e9es ranging from $20 for a flatbread up to $46 for filet mignon.  This seemed to be about the right level of restaurant for what we wanted for the evening.\nThe ambience could be described as informal (see the photo). The room is quite large. There are large screen televisions everywhere playing various athletic events. Tables without tablecloths. There is an open kitchen on the left as you walk in. And there is a very large bar towards the rear. The music is loud but not obnoxious. Overall, it has the feel of an upscale Gastro pub crossed with a sports bar.\nThe service was really outstanding. Jesus, our server, came to the table almost immediately to take our drink orders and to explain the menu and the specials. Very friendly, making us feel welcome. During the meal, our water glasses never got even half empty before he was there to refill them. The pace of the service was just about right. A very nice touch was when the chef brought out our steak to show us what it looked like before they sliced it. \nWe ordered a chickpea salad to share. It was very good, not great. My wife got the meatball flatbread to share with her friend. This turned out to be a very thin crust 12 inch pizza with very flavorful ricotta cheese and somewhat spicy meatballs. The flavor was excellent. However, at $23 for a 12 inch pizza, it was a bit pricey for what you got.\nMy buddy and I decided to share the special porterhouse steak. It was a huge steak. It was served with a small amount of potatoes on the side. The steak was cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious. The potatoes are also quite tasty. My big gripe however was that the steak cost $120. I almost fell off my chair when I got the check. I had figured that with the filet mignon costing $46, the shareable porterhouse would be in the range of $60 or $70.  I never would have guessed that in an informal Gastro pub type restaurant that a steak would cost anywhere close to that price. Clearly this was my bad for not asking before ordering. And it was quite good in terms of the taste. Just not $120 worth of good.\nOverall, ambiance, service, and food were all five star. However, when you consider value for the dollar spent, this was not a 5 star dining experience."

Once seated we weren't approached by our waitress until about 10 minutes later. Throughout the entire meal she was very inattentive. It wasn't just our waitress though our runner also seemed pretty awful. He first brought our food to the wrong table and then to us. Even as he was setting everything down he seemed very uneasy and shaky. It seemed like this was the first week they had ever worked in a restaurant.\n\nFood wise it was pretty good. I had the croquet Madame sandwich which came with a fried egg and gravy type sauce on the top, very good! Also you can't beat bottomless mimosas for $15. \n\nIf only this place could train up their staff it'd be a huge successful. The ambulance and location are great!"

We started off with a pastry basket which was just lovely, filled with some small fresh danishes, banana bread, and fresh bread with a beautiful maple butter. I then ordered the two eggs any style which comes with potatoes and toast and my friend ordered a croissant with ham and cheese and egg and bacon along with hashbrowns. Everything ordered was absolutely delicious. The hashbrowns came with applesauce that was freshly made in the house as well as ketchup and butter on the side. We had bottomless Mimosas which were really good and made it that much more fun. Another friend got the bagel and salmon breakfast which was crazy good and very fresh as well as a fruit bowl which was easily one of the best fruit bowls I have ever tasted, showing up with a cantaloupe that was sliced along with beautiful berries marinated in their own juices to create a sweet and beautiful taste.\nThe service was top-notch with very friendly people and very fast and efficient. It was a wonderful experience and we are totally going back. It doesn't hurt that the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with a beautiful light air feeling to it as it is large and spacious and it is packed with people having a good time. The restaurant also has an outside area. Reservations are wise and I would recommend them."

            "review": "Huge disappointment! When we first walked in to the restaurant I had a really good vibe. Friendly hostess at the front and really nice decor. Our reservations were at 630pm and the rest of our party got there around 645. I'm hoping our main server was new because she seemed afraid to talk and was very unorganized. The second server that was helping was very confident and friendly. \nMy husband and I ordered the pizza special which was duck and prosciutto pizza, the wagyu short rib burger, the meat and cheese platter and the jalapeno hummus. We were a table of 12 so when everyone's food started to come out at different times at first it was understandable. About 30 mins into the meal glasses were empty and sat empty for a while. No water or alcohol to help ease the pain of waiting over 2 hours for our main course. One of our friends dishes was completely forgotten, our burger was not ordered and another friends cheese dish was not brought out (they only gave him bread, no cheese).  To add to the unorganized mess, our $21.00 yes I said $21.00 wagyu short rib burger was a total waste of money. They did a really good job making the exact replica of  the animal sauce at inn n out burger and it was overcooked. I would rather pay half the price for a black truffle cheeseburger a couple doors down at the yard house. The duck prosciutto pizza which was $19.00 had a few little pieces of duck that you could barely see/taste and a little tiny slice of prosciutto on each slice of pizza. Again not worth it. \nTo end the 3 hour long dinner the male server asks how things were and I told him it was OK. I normally don't like to complain but he asked me for my \"honest opinion\" twice more (I guess because he saw we only took a few bites of our $21 burger and not even trying the fries) so I told him in a nice way what I thought. Mentioning everything from the forgotten dishes to the 2 hour wait for our main course and the ridiculously priced burgers.  He tells us \"oh yes I heard about the forgotten dishes and the two our wait for food\" and apologized to our table offering a couple of free desserts. We kindly declined because at this point we didn't want to wait another hour for our dessert to arrive. When we received our bill the only thing that was taken off was one of the forgotten dishes. No manager came over to speak with us or anything. There are more negative things to add to this review but it is long enough already. I had really high hopes for this restaurant but will never be going back to this place."

It's well worth the trip. \n\nWhen you first walk in there's this weird gallery wall that I'm not a huge fan of, but the rest of the decor throughout the restaurant, including the patio is very homey and well done. I wouldn't mind living there. \n\nThe service was great. We had a group of six people, two of which were kids and one baby. They accommodated us very well. Not to mention they had kid's menus. It's rare you go to a restaurant like this and they actually have a tangible paper kids menu (No doodling space though). I tried the deviled eggs and the beet and arugula salad. The deviled eggs were so fantastic. I wish I could replicate them. And the beet salad was very refreshing and light. Although, I do wish they put more than just 3 leaves of arugula on it and transformed it into more of an actual salad. \n\nThe kids loved their Mac & cheese, chicken tenders and grilled cheese and tomato soup. Also: honorable mention to our waitress who allowed us to convert the fancy adult Mac & cheese into a kids version even though it wasn't on the menu. \n\nCheck it out if you're ever in Summerlin, or not... Just check it out. Period."

She made sure everything was special for all 6 of us. We named our pig 'Ham Solo' and what a surprise, when we were seated, and saw the Star Wars masks! Nice touch! The whole experience, especially for our out of town guests, was fantastic. The whole staff went above and beyond. A night we will always remember. \n\nThe food was superb! We started off with the meat and cheese tray and some specialty drinks, flower bomb, Hearthstone margarita and sangria. All delicious. Next, Ham Solo was rolled out on a cart and placed on our Star Wars themed table for the knife. The prep was something to watch and brought in a few of the surrounding table guests for picture ops. The energy of the room changed dramatically when our pig entered. And a team placed our plated pig and all the sides on our table for the feast. Then the chef personally came out and presented a special dish to our vegetarian  friend. We had friends from out of state and locals with us. It was so memorable. And Hearthstone just made some new friends for life. \n\nThere wasn't much of the suckling pig left after we tore into it. It was, by far, the best pork we have all ever had. Juicy, flavorful and the sides complemented the meat perfectly.\n\nWe all talked about it for hours after we were finished. That's how wonderful the whole experience was. We'll be talking about it for years to come and have already started planning our next one. \n\nThank you Hearthstone team. Each and every one of you! See you next time!"

Is so awesome. I love the layout, the TV's are everywhere. Perfect place to watch a game. Just a really cool spot to eat or drink at. \n\nOnly bad thing...is the service. I've never waited to long for a drink. Each drink takes about 15 mins. Our server Shahenna never once asked how our food was. Mind you the 4 of us in the bar area had a $250 bill. It would of been way more if someone wanted to help serve us. We would of ordered more food or drinks. She was definitely not feeling us that night. The group of guys behind us got their water before we got asked if we wanted anything. They got refills before we got a drink.

            "review": "On a whim, we decided to try Hearthstone for brunch\u00a0today. The place is huge. Maybe too huge for its own good. The hostess was very accommodating about seating us out on the patio. But I hated how she was dressed... I saw what appeared to be another hostess dressed comparably... like it was 11 p.m. on a Friday nite. Not appropriate, especially considering wait staff attire being very casual. Moving along... It took a looong time to even get menus & beverages. Either the hostess needs to provide the menus at seating or they needed to be at the table. Then, when we WERE noticed, it was by about 4 different people. Make up your mind. Maybe before you open? We asked about several items on the menu & asked for personal opinion on the items... that was no help. So I chose the 'safest bet' of the options. Now, I'm hardly ever one to complain about the price of a solid meal- as long as the ambiance, service AND food are on point- but we were shocked at how alarmingly small the portions are. My whole entr\u00e9e, which was $20, was literally the size of 2 golf balls. What is that?, 6 bites? My brunch husband got 2 eggs any style & the menu said it came with toast & jam plus either fresh fruit or hash browns. The 2 scrambled eggs were maybe 3 bites. The hash browns were a wee bit more substantial but shouldn't have been what carried the entr\u00e9e (for his sake, thank goodness they did. kind of.) We inquired about the whereabouts of the toast/bread &, while it was in no way an argument, it was far too lengthy of a debate over bread. Nonetheless, we were delivered complimentary buttered, toasted baguette that was quite delicious... probably because we were still famished. Maybe there are still kinks to be worked out but I'm not wasting my money or time there for a while. If it survives that long."

It is a RSVP only event. We received a invite by email and printed tickets for the event. This was our first time visiting this new Restaurant. We have been looking forward to it since it opened. The Restaurant is beautiful but customer service is terrible. The music was way to loud for a wine event, no one could really talk to each other without yelling. The real issue we had with this place was the terrible service by the two waitresses serving the event area. I asked one young lady where the free appetizers  were. She informed me that they don't do that anymore it was something they did when they first started the events but have stopped. I explained it was in the email and on the tickets and that was not a good way to do business. I then asked her to bring us menu's. It took about 15 minutes to get them and from another waitress. I then asked this young lady about the appetizers too and she had no clue and was going to ask the manager. I told her please do and that we were going to order something off the menu either way. She never returned. We watched her and the first waitress wait on only certain people around us. The people they waited on were younger people about the waitresses ages. The older customer seemed to be ignored. Not sure what that was about. So after 2 very good glasses of wine that they did give us free (separate wine server) as part of the event. We all were very hungry and decided to go next door to Mercadito and order food and drinks. We were not disappointed. The service was outstanding and the food and drinks were great. We bought a couple bottles of wine at Mercadito too, which we were going to buy a few bottles at Hearthstone but never had the chance. So we highly recommend Mercadito and would suggest passing on Hearthstone until they step up their game. Very disappointed because it is a beautiful place and the menu and wine list looks great but it does not matter if service sucks.   One last note. We commented on this issue on Hearthstones facebook page under the Wine event post and they deleted it and never commented or messaged us back. So remember, only positive feedback will they share on social media. That is why I decided to go to Yelp and post."

We were sat right away but not given any menus had to ask for them which is odd as a former server that makes no sense to me. Our server was friendly and up-sold the bottomless mimosa we ordered that and a strawberry cobbler to start.\nThe cobbler took forever and when it arrived it was like luke warm strawberry soup. Would have said something but our server didn't check on us when it arrived.\n he returned we ordered the cinnamon bun French toast, and the chicken and waffles. \nFlash forward 45 minutes our food finally arrives, my husbands chicken is dry and cold and my cinnamon bun is cold and raw in the middle yet the plates are blazing hot, now the reason for that is the food was made and sitting in the window under a heat lamp causing the plate to heat up. Also the chicken is what is called \"sand-bagged\" meaning made earlier then refried when ordered which any chef will tell you dries the hell out of it. So we complain, the server re-fires the food. Another 20 minutes and out comes the food, COLD AND DRY AGAIN! at this point I had enough I go to the manager who tells me he will speak to the chef and take our food off the check. So for two hours we got to drink mimosas, what a waste. BTW the mimosas were advertised as bottomless yet we got charged for two bottles and the second one we didn't ask for. Paid 32.00 for two bottles of mimosas. And for the first time in my life we got to spend two hours in a restaurant and leave hungry. I also want to point out that we saw this place on the food network and shame on you food network for making me think this restaurant  was better then it actually is. \nWill never go back."

Coming up to the hostess podium, I could see that there was not much action going on in the dining room. I was early, went to the bar and grabbed a drink. The specialty cocktails are on the sweeter side. The service is was nice. The back area is pretty sweet. With two shuffleboard tables and a comfortable sitting arrangement, it could definitely be a place to chill with your friends, grab a few drinks and light bites.\n\nIt caught me a little off guard was when the hostess came to find me at the bar and asked if I wanted to cancel my reservation. I told her that I was just waiting for my party and they should be here soon. It was only 6:20. I was informed that if I wanted to be sat, I could without them, otherwise they would be giving away my table. Okay... I will be sat then. Good thing another friend had shown up and we began to order. Apparently the chef's special meat and cheese board sometimes does not include a cheese. That was when we went about customizing our own board. Sadly, the pickles were probably the best item we got on the board. When I think about charcuterie boards, I think about a small variety of different items to sample. Especially if there is an option for the chef to highlight his best items of the day. The oysters were decent. Nothing spectacular. The foie gras with strawberry jam was fantastic. I could eat that all day. I ended up scrapping the container clean. The harvest quinoa salad was a nice balance of texture and flavors. The charred octopus was tender and a hit. When it was the time for mains, we were all getting full. Instead of doing multiple entrees, we just did their special 40oz tomahawk ribeye. This was probably the worst part of our meal. I was shocked when it came out 20 minutes after we ordered. Yes, we asked for medium rare, but that would have been a record in cooking time. No sear or car on the outside. I cut into it near the center and sure enough it was raw. We sent it back and it came out medium well. Oh, well. You can't win them all. We did however get the lobster polenta and the roasted squash with burrata. Both side dishes outshone the steak itself. \n\nWe left stuffed. I just wasn't sure if I would order some of these items again. I definitely liked Hearthstone enough to go back again. Maybe just for casual nibbles and some drinks."

I highly appreciate not being rushed out of a restaurant but had to wait quite awhile to be helped, water replenished-one time which never happened, didn't get all the food we ordered and staff wasnt very knowledgeable about the food questions I have regarding my food allergies and I didn't feel very comfortable eating. \n\nAmbience, food, and staff friendliness were excellent. Please work on service because for the amount of workers running around, not having good service is suprising. I appreciated the diverse menu-can come here more often, not just when I'm in the mood for one specific cuisine. Really liked the sofas and shuffle board located inside. It's a great place all around.\n\nWe ordered off the meats and cheese menu. Prosciutto was very good, braesola-never delivered, Cremont and cheddar cheeses were excellent, honey and other spreads were excellent. Would have been nice to have more bread come with it for the amount we ordered. Mac and cheese, squash were excellent. Pizza was great. Hamburger was good.\n\nWill return and try again. Highly recommended."

The food is alight for the price. Although we sat inside and a bug was found in one of our drinks and our waitress (Danielle) did ask if we wanted a new one, when we said no bc we were going to try something else the server never came back to take our order for the new drink. Meanwhile when we were finally done and asked to close out our check we waited over 10 or so minutes until for her to come back with our check. Will not be my first choice to come back when visiting Red Rock. Giving them 2 stars bc the food was the only thing worth being there for."

            "review": "It's a shame the reviews are so lousy, but here's my take on it. It's not very organized. It's new enough that this doesn't bother me, and I own a restaurant so there are things I am relaxed about that prior to being in business I'd have been very upset about. \n\nHere's the negative - things take way too long to get to the table (even the bill can take 20 minutes), but I hope a couple months and this will get worked out. Staff is friendly, but either over worked or disorganized. The music is wayyyyyy to loud. It's hard to talk without yelling. I know this seems to be the new thing and it makes a place seem busy even when it's not, but it drives me nuts (this is about only thing that will keep me from eating there every week or two). The other thing I don't like, which has nothing to do with my dining experience, is the form contact response with email address to a bad review. I empower all of my staff to comp, give out samples, whatever they need to to make customers happy. This makes them feel better about their job too, because they no they can make decisions at work without having to talk with a supervisor (just a suggestion). Also, it's smoother because when someone gets upset it gets fixed right then and there. If you don't like how they handled it, you discuss alternatives later, but let them make choice at the time. \n\nPositive - And, why we'll go back. The food was excellent. I could not pick on the sauce for the short ribs being too salty, but otherwise we had a large group with a lot of things to try and everything was very good."

I really enjoyed the some of the small plates for sharing. For instance, the Baked Ricotta & Honey was to-die-for, and the Charcuterie had some nice proscuitto & salami. But these plates literally came with like 4 pieces of bread....and weren't really large enough for sharing. \n\nOverall, I just feel like the bang for your buck is not there. It's a cute space and the food is decent, but if I'm paying $11 for a Caesar salad, I expect it to be a full size salad. My salad was maybe the size of a side order, if that. I definitely still left hungry after spending $35....\n\nPS - Came here for the \"Share the Love\" event, which I think is pretty awesome. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of house wine with dinner, and if you order a charcuterie plate, $5 goes to charity :) Event ends 2/7 so head on over soon if you wanna check it out!"

Hearthstone had a very attractive menu and we always pass it whenever we would go to the movies.\n\nI had dropped off my son to go find parking, this past Sunday. We were going in for brunch and we needed a good place to eat. I parked and went to the front door. My son was still standing there waiting by the wall and when I had asked him if he got a table, he said he tried but the hostess \"looked busy.\" I saw NO ONE around and the hostess was playing around with her computer and she heard me and quickly defended herself, saying she didn't see my son and that it was busy. I asked her why it took her for me to say something out loud in order for her to ask us if we were being helped. She disregarded my question and DID NOT even apologize! She was rude, unkempt and to shut me up with my questions and wanting to get rid of me, she said I can seat you now. She did not introduce herself either.\n\nI was already upset at this point because my son was disregarded and we sat down proceeded to order. Again, no name from the waiter (he was a bald headed gentleman) and he took awhile to get our menus and drinks. The place was not even busy! He did not recommend anything or ask if it was our first time there. You can clearly tell that he wasn't interested in explaining anything in the menu because when  had asked how the meat, cheese, and bread platter worked, he just said \"you just order it to whatever you want.\" I asked him for a recommendation, he said, it depends on what you want and just read me the menu (which I could have done myself). I had mentioned that I wanted to order two types of bread and when all our food came, I had asked him about it, he said, \"Oh, I thought you were just asking about it.\" Um, isn't that the whole point? I ask for the bread and hopefully I get the bread?\n\nThe couple next to me was having the same ordeal as myself and was not happy with their order. I saw them sent back their order TWICE and they were still not happy with it. I saw the manager, who's name was Aienrry, and requested to speak with him.\n\nHe was very nice and accommodating, kept asking what I would like for him to do, I wanted the name of the hostess because she needed to be educated and trained in customer service. He slyly avoided giving me her name by giving me his card and saying he would email me to compensate for the lack of service that my son and I received, by coming by again for dinner. After such a negative experience, I do not know if I ever want to come back to a place such as this! I still have yet to receive an email and do not plan on coming back. It's so sad that a beautiful space such as this, runs an unprofessional restaurant and lacks customer service.\n\nMy boyfriend and I experience new restaurants every week and we recommend places to our friends who come in from out of town. We will not be recommending this place to any of our local or out of town friends. Do yourself a favor, please do not come to this place. Save your money and go somewhere else."

I asked to speak with a manager and she was \"too busy\" so she sent her assistant manager that made even more excuses as to why THE CHICKEN WAS RAW. I asked nicely to have it removed from my bill and she refused. I could not believe I had to sit there and argue my point across to this \"Assistant Manager\". She brought me the bill and said she will not charge me for the chicken pot pie because she realized she was wrong. So I proceeded to give her cash for the bill and my card for a tip for Daniel my server. The assistant manager returned to my table with my card and as I looked at the receipt she charged the full amount on my card and took all the cash as well. I confronted the \"General Manager\" and she said \"Call your bank and they will give you your money back\" I was so appalled at this woman's words and actions I left so upset that this restaurant would STEAL FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS!

We tried several of their cocktails, as well as 7-8 tapas dishes, and we liked all of them.  Mushroom flatbread and Stuffed dates were both favorites.\n\nAtmospherre was also great.  Very large open space, great decor.  Outside seating.  Best part is, the whole end of the restaurants opens up, to give the room an open air feel.  Can't beat the atmosphere.\n\nThe issue for us was the service.  We had a 6:30 reservation, arrived promptly.  The hostess said an outside table was available, and she would come get us at the bar - it was just being bussed.  20 minutes later she still had not come.  I went back to the hostess stand, and she apologized, saying the table still wasn't bussed, and this sometimes happened.   5 minutes later, a different hostess, with a different story, came to seat us, saying it was simpy a miscommunication.\n\nNext issue - once seated, it was 10 minutes before anyone said a peep to us.  No menus, no \"I'll be right with you\", nothing.  Once the server came, she was very friendly, and excellent.  \n\nFinal issue, we never got one of our tapas dishes.  We said somethning about midway through, and server checked, and said somethning happened.   Did not arrive until after we were done everything else.\n\nAs they are relatively new, we can certainly understand these issues, and will try them again.

The place was basically set up for service failure because they have servers managing odd sections.\nOur server ignored is constantly and NEVER checked on us.\nI recommend sitting inside for preferably better attentiveness. Their weekly deals are really great like their 10$ lollipop chicken weeks all you can eat on chicken wing day. Their drinks were really really good and strong. I definitely want to try their cheese and meat plates sometime when I get to it. I was also not please for being charged $4 for club soda.... Lol\n\nLexi their hostess is amazing!!!! She was bright and bubbly :)\n\nOverall they need to hire more staff, their bussers however are fantastic and friendly and checked on us more than our server did... It was impossible to get a refill on water and ask for the check."

Our waitress literally came to our table ONCE to get our order then she disappeared like a rare Pok\u00e9mon. After a half hour, my boyfriend tracked down the hostess to complain and get our waitress. Oh and now finally the rare Pok\u00e9mon appeared five minutes later (insert eye roll here). Oh what did we order though? The French toast, California Benedict, pancakes, and corner beef hash. There was four of us lol anyways, tell me WHY MY FOOD WAS COLD when I got it. I didn't know corned beef hash was supposed to be cold? I felt like it had been left out or someone returned it and now I was getting it. After a few bites, I just stopped eating. My boyfriends french toast was cold too, not warm at all. Oh and my sisters pancakes were cold too. We've come here before and really liked it but today was a disaster. Horrible service and cold food. The place wasn't even busy for crying out loud. We decided to go to fatburger in the food court now instead of eating this.  Not sure if we want to come here again. (OH the family of four in the booth next to us ended up leaving because no tended to them AT ALL)."

It was uber crowded so we decided to snag a table in the lounge and eat there.  Since the seating was a bit awkward, we decided on passed apps and a few drinks.\n\nI love the menu here and the concept is similar to chez panisse or its offshoot camino in Oakland.  The food was terrific and I would definitely come back to sample more.  The FG&J is a must try for foie lovers.  My wife also enjoyed a couple of the hand crafted cocktails.\n\nService was ok, but I'm not holding that against them.  It was a busy friday night and the cocktails waitress was pretty slammed.  Also, the restaurant is pretty loud, not just in the bar area, but also in the dining room."

Slow refills, staff that wasn't entirely informed on the menu and a hostess that was clearly hired for looks over substance. \n\nAs the evening progressed, the quality of the food more than made up for the lackluster service that started out our evening. Service became much more attentive once we were ushered indoors when it got a little gusty. \n\nMy favorites from the evening were the charred octopus, FG & J, steak tartare, crabby cakes and roast. \n\nI look forward to utilizing that patio again soon for brunch before the weather gets too warm. Great meal overall. Full disclosure, we were not presented with a check at the end of the meal, but we tipped very generously."

My party and I all agreed that the service here was unacceptable. To start, we had no idea who our server was because we went through four different waiters throughout the night, not including the bus boys. Further, one bus boy accidentally put water in one of our parties' drink. He only gave her an excuse and failed to ask her to replace it. Additionally, we had to ask for water on our first glass 3 times (from three different waiters) and lastly one server spilled water all over the table and a wallet, however, it was not acknowledged and not cleaned up. To top it all off, the ants and cockroaches weren't the most appealing. This place only deserved two stars because of the music."

It's surprisingly hard to find a deal that good for bottomless mimosas in this town. My food was also really good! We sat on the patio and there was a view of the mountains to look at the entire brunch. Before we got our food the manager came up to us and said there was a seating issue and asked if we would mind moving to a two person table (we were sitting at a 4 top), and of course we didn't mind. But beyond that, he said he would take care of our mimosas for the trouble. I have never had a restaurant do that before. Amazing hospitality!! Will definitely be returning."

They've been having it since they opened, or almost, but this was the first opportunity we've had to try it out.  I've checked out the menu outside the restaurant lots of times, but knew early on that this wasn't our kind of place.  I'll eat almost anything, but actually am not enticed by 90% of what they offer.  My husband is much harder to please (if it's not spelled c-h-i-c-k-e-n, he's outta there.).  That, and we both find the prices over the top.  But we wanted to see what all the hoopla was about, so we dipped our toes in.  \n\nIf I had to rate Hearthstone for ambience, I'd give it a 4, maybe even a 5.  Light, airy, spacious, industrial but warm, comfortable.  It was interesting - and rare - to see most of the attractive booths unoccupied and many more people choosing tables.  The patio was nice, too, and the lounge section is completely open to the patio.  \n\nWe were given tickets for two wine samplings each, 2 oz pours - a sauvignon blanc or, I think, a pinot grigio.  We chose the white.  I don't know what the heck was in that wine, but before I finished the first sample, I was buzzed.  By the second, I had to seriously take stock of whether I was capable of driving home!  Yeah, I've never been accused of having a hollow leg, but this was unprecedented.  \n\nThere were also supposed to be passed appetizers, but they didn't materialize.  Instead, more than an hour into the two-hour gig the group of three next to us was served a buffalo mozzarella flatbread.  The wine-tasting wasn't crowded, but for the next 20 minutes, nobody else was given anything.  Finally, a waiter appeared with flatbreads, and all of us had something to stave off the potent wine.  \n\nI had high hopes, but we weren't blown away by the pizza.  The mozzarella was too chewy, and the crust too salty.  We'll stick with the one at Kona Grill, whose HH flatbread is less than half the price.\n\nI wanted so much to love it, but alas, I didn't.  Maybe the real food is better, but again, that menu is not singing to me."

Everything was great: food, service, atmosphere.  I received a free glass of Pinot Noir for checking in on Yelp!; their house options were delicious.\n\nWe were seated right away and our waitress was attentive and knew her audience (knew how to work the wallet, haha).  We ordered appetizers and had some wine before ordering our main entrees.  We shared the braised shortrib meatballs (in a tomato sauce), bacon wrapped dates (they were HUGE and so good), and the tuna tartare (heavily loaded with truffle oil- not my thing).  \n\nAfter enjoying our appetizers, we ordered the fried chicken, pot pie (more truffle oil), calabrian shrimp pasta, cheeseburger, octopus, and mac and cheese (made with brie and fontina). The pot pie and cheeseburger were okay, but the pasta and octopus were delicious.  The fried chicken and mac and cheese were the solid runaway dishes, though.  The chicken was JUICY and flavorful while the mac and cheese was rich and decadent.  I would order those two items again, no questions asked.\n\nSomehow we were coaxed into ordering dessert (we ate every bite of every entree and practically felt sick when we left) and shared the peanut butter lava cake and chocolate souffle.  The lava cake was also rich and the chocolate souffle was the least exciting thing we ate all night.\n\nAfter finishing our feast, we took advantage of the shuffleboard games in the corner and had a great time.

We reviewed the menu and chatted. \n\nI didn't drink but my dining compadres had mixed reviews of their cocktails. One good, one bad. Pricey, as expected, around $12. \n\nAmbiance is very cool. Decor is awesome. It's noisy and upbeat inside. Casual, hip, and comfy all at once. Nice room. Perfect spot for a drink and some snacks. There's shuffleboard too. \n\nWe tried loads of items and shared everything. Grilled octopus, stuffed dates, four gras mousse, clams, tuna carpaccio, pork rillette, mozzarella flatbread, meatballs, squash. They will give you bread upon request which was needed. There was not enough served with the rillette or foie. The stunners were the octopus and dates. The octopus was so flavorful and tender. The dates were big and scrumptious. It was very cool that the server offered to change the serving to 4 so we could each have one. The squash was under seasoned and cold. The rillette was very bland. Clams had a delicious favor but were tiny so a bit dry. Foie mousse was good but very light on the foie flavor. Carpaccio and flatbread were tasty. \n\nService was over zealous. They were super upbeat and friendly but we were slightly over served. There was constantly, and I mean constantly, someone asking how we were, asking to clear plates, filling water etc. I told 6 people I wasn't done with a plate because I was dipping bread in the sauce. I finally gave up and let them take it away. Arguably, this is not a bad thing. We certainly got everything we needed and had plenty of attention. But, it was to the point where you couldn't finish a sentence in the conversation without being interrupted. \n\nWe had the peanut butter lava cake filled with butterscotch and finished with banana ice cream. Absolute perfection. Very clever and delicious. \n\nAll in all, a very nice and delicious experience. I would definitely return. Items are great to share for 2 people. Most are too small to share with 4. \n\n6 drinks, and bunches of tapas was $211 for 4, so $251 with tip. Certainly a pricier than usual dinner, but a fun addition to Summerlin."

The manager told us this would take three days to clear, there were no changes! After a few days not only did we not receive credit to our account there was another charge of $75!!! I could not believe this at all!

He had everything reversed and the $100 charged to our card within three business days... Quite honestly for putting up with this for nearly three weeks I believe everything should have been comped. This is so unprofessional and and was handled in the worst way.. We will never be going back to this restaurant... If you plan on visiting this place make sure you pay cash and even then double check what they give back to is the correct amount of change!"

Its huge with plenty of seating and some casual couch seating as well. The waitresses had cute uniforms with suspenders. Our waitress was very attentive and nice. \nWe started with the grilled artichoke appetizer which was pretty good but not overly impressive. We ordered the deviled eggs which were alright as well. We also had the bone marrow which I loved.\nWe ordered a cheese and meat board which is their thing there. We weren't overly impressed by this either. \nFor an entree I got the Salmon Carpaccio which was really good. \nTheir sangria was excellent along with their Blueberry Bliss cocktail.\nOur meal experience didn't feel like it was really worth the cost however.\nI would like to come here for brunch some time and enjoy the nice outdoor seating."

We both ordered California Benedict, and while the eggs were expertly poached and the chicken and avocado very good, we were very (unpleasantly) surprised that, rather than being served upon an English muffin or other bread, it was served upon a tomato. The menu said nothing about the tomato, and I would never have ordered it if I had known (mostly because I hate tomatoes). \nWe asked for an English muffin instead, and not only did they replace our tomatoes with bread, the manager also came over and personally took care of it on our check as well. Hearthstone was genuinely concerned that we had a pleasant experience. Their customer service and food deserve five stars, but I took one because I feel the menu could be made more clear, so as to avoid situations like this in the future. I very much recommend this place, and can't wait to go back."

The food here was delicious. I've been craving good food since we came back from Chicago and the food at Hearthstone satisfied that craving like no other. I'll start by saying the atmosphere is perfect. I'm one to judge my experience by multiple things; decor/atmosphere being in my top three. Second service was on point. Our server Taylor joined in on our tipsy conversation about going to a Bieber concert just because \"the girlfriend wants to go\"  debate. He was super friendly and had good suggestions on the menu; which made it more difficulty to select something.  I really enjoyed my endless and free mimosa this Sunday. This will be a place I will come to weekly."

It's among the top places to dine with friends and family outside the Vegas Strip.\n\nFood\n-Best Fried Chicken I've had in a long long time.  Juicy and moist inside with a crisp and tasty outside, perfection.  They also drizzle a little honey on top that really adds to the dish.\n-Gastropub is code for 'small portions but quality', that being said I felt that all our entrees had adequate food portion, and the quality was there.\n\nAtmosphere\n-I was expecting the 'corporate hipster facade' but this place is more than that.  \n-It has a great energy and the live band was awesome.  They played pop standards but also mellowed them out a bit for a relaxed vibe.  I loved it.\n\nService\n-Someone wrote in a review that they only hire 'hot people' which can be a red flag sometimes.  While our server was not hard to look at she was also very informed on the menu and took great care of our party of 6.\n-Guy with water brought his A game that night.  My glass was always full.\n\nI would highly recommend this place as it is one of the best dinning experiences I have had inside of a casino."

The decor is great and makes the place feel so homey.\n\nThe first time I had the Mac and cheese and broccoli. The Mac and cheese was fantastic. The broccoli was a little burnt but overall it was good. My boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken and he said that it wasn't that great and he wouldn't order it again. \n\nThe second time we went we started with oysters from the west coast and they were super delicious(make sure you get the small ones). However I felt like they were overpriced because we got 6 and that cost $20. Would've loved to get more but that's too expensive.We then got the charcuterie, which I would say was average. My boyfriend got the chicken wings and said they were good. Once again, I got the Mac and cheese which was even more delicious that the 1st time. This time I requested no bread crumbs on the broccoli and it was amazing. Overall I think the sides are much better than the entrees so that's what I'll stick to the next time I go back."

She was very sweet and accommodating and we ended up staying outside. That's about where the good service ended. We ended up having two waitresses because the first one never came back around to our table. The second waitress took our food order and we waited thirty minutes for our food because apparently the chef didn't like the way the food was prepared? Two tables who sat after us got their food before us. Then they had to fix our check three times because there was stuff on there that we didn't order. \n\nI will say however that the food was sooooo good. I had the egg cocotte and my boyfriend had the pancakes and both were delicious!

Actually it was a large dining room with widely space tables, a few booths and a counter with views of the kitchen. At first this was disappointing since we were hoping for Christmas decorations. After a few minutes the dining room felt fine, except we were near an entry from outside. Whenever (not often) someone came in, a blast of cold air momentarily hit us.\nI'd say our experience was very good.

We've never even heard of a \"hangers\" steak before but it was worth the try! We finished off with the peanut butter lava cake that we just couldn't resist! The staff was so friendly and helpful, our waitress Jessica was amazing along with the wait help. The manager Sarah even came by to talk to us and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. One of the best restaurant experiences we've ever had in Vegas. We'll definitely be back for more!"

Tables for a party of more than four are high-tops with exceedingly uncomfortable bar chairs.  One of our party has had knee replacement and couldn't have her leg hanging from the stool/chair for and extended time.  We asked for one of the lobby stools to be brought over for her to rest her foot on; the wait staff was unable to accommodate this and told us it would have to be a manager (the manager never showed) but the wait staff kept coming by to find out if the manager had satisfied our request (we were there nearly 3 hours it never happened).\n\nEverything in the restaurant is hard surfaces which leads to a very LOUD room, the only saving grace to this was the staff didn't increase the volume of the music with the volume of the patrons.  As it was it was so loud you could only hear the person immediately next to you, forget about having a cohesive group conversation with the 7 people we had there for dinner.  The wait staff is done \"team style\" which is good in theory but leads to a lot of disconnect between what we asking for versus what we were being given.\n\nRegarding the food:\nIts billed as rustic American cuisine; however, its very French and Italian - sorry but this gave me a chuckle as I was reviewing the menu.  \nCocktails -  \nMojito - she returned it as undrinkable\nRed Sangria - she said it was alright but rather weak in flavor.\nBottle of red wine - unsure of what it was but the others started doing internet searches on its value and rating which led me to believe they weren't overly impressed with it.\nAppetizers - \nAbe Froman flatbread - was told that it was good but way to heavy with fennel for my taste.\nCarbonara  Flatbread - was alright, I've had better.\nRoasted Artichokes with Black Truffle Yogurt - this was pretty tasty and we all seemed to enjoy it.\nDinner - We had several with duplicate food orderings.\nRotisseri Chicken & Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Jalapenos  and Roast \nBroccoli- Chicken was okay, moist not dried out, could have done without the charred thyme stalks. Potatoes were tasty but randomly seasoned.  Was told that the broccoli was not worth ordering again.\nWagyu Burger Special - he said it was good but only ate half of it so I was left wondering.\nWagyu Short Ribs - he seemed to be satisfied with his.\nPesto Shrimp Pasta - was told it was good but she felt over priced.\nDesert - \nPeanut Butter Lava Cake - everyone said this was good but they couldn't have more than a couple of bites.\nApple Tart - was very good according to all.\nBlood Orange Sorbet - was really looking forward to this and sorely disappointed, tasted like it was made with Tang and red food coloring.\n\nAll in all I'm glad someone was able to put this on their expense account.  I don't see that any of us that live here will be returning for another meal."

            "review": "We had a pretty disappointing experience here for Sunday Brunch. They got us through the door with free bottomless mimosas, but I personally didn't think they were very good.\n\nFirst the good:\n+You can enter the restaurant from the outside and don't have to go through the casino.\n+The food was pretty yummy.\n+The people that were there were generally having a good time.\n\nNow the bad:\n-We didn't make reservations, that's our bad. The restaurant was full when we first arrived, so we made reservations and left for an hour. The problem with bottomless mimosas is that people tend to sit around drinking them for hours. We would have preferred to sit outside, but when we got back an hour later, all the outside tables were still full with all the same people that were there when we left.\n-Very small portions for the food, which is overpriced. I paid $16 for eggs benedict, which was very tasty, and had a side of potatoes which were also very tasty, but the plate was basically less than half full. And they tried to charge me $21 for it (more on this later)\n-When we sat down, we got two different menus. It looked like they had old menus mixed in with new menus, and 2 of us got the old one and 2 of us got the new one. This is why I got charged $21 for half a plate of Eggs Benedict instead of $16. They apparently increased their prices even MORE on the new menu, but forgot to pull their old menu out of circulation, so a few of our prices were not rang up correctly. They did get it fixed for us, but it was frustrating.\n-My Fiancee ordered an omelette that was supposed to have broccoli, spinach, and cheese. She received it and the only thing inside of it was broccoli. She asked the waitress if it was missing something and the waitress immediately said \"we'll make you a new one.\" When her omelette came back, it was the same exact thing - only broccoli. We gave up after that.\n-Service was SLOWWWW. I mean, I get it. They were busy. But they were also very understaffed. We waited about 45 minutes for our food, and then when we wanted to pay and get out of there we waited almost 15 minutes for someone to come and take our payment. That means our entire dining experience was over 2 hours not including the hour that we left to come back. If we had known brunch was gonna take that long, we would have gone somewhere else.\nWe won't be going back."

Well 20 minutes turned into almost 40 and the hostess did not even flinch to call us, we were waiting for a \"call\" that NEVER came through. Well my husband went to check and she said \" well you are going to have to wait 20 more minutes, I mean HELLOOOOOO, how could she? Then thank God for the waitress in the game room area, she took care of us, we were uncomfortable to say the least. We couldn't enjoy each other's company but at least we ate.  So it wasn't memorable but just as regular as any fast food restaurant. The food was good no doubt about it but your hostess threw our nice memorable family dinner out of the window which we paid a lot of money got so for that reason you get 2 stars."

Though I saw the 3 1/2 average stars and their corporate looking logo, nothing could stop me. I came despite the fact that the item I saw on food porn could only be ordered for a few hours on Sunday during brunch and I was coming for dinner... still I came!\nWell, you walk in to the place and honestly it is stunning. The design is clever, using reclaimed, repurposed everything. Super chic. Old, dimly lit industrial lighting is everywhere. As far as design goes, it doesn't get any better.\nWe started at the bar, ordered a Big Tom's Sour. What I received was watery fruit juice with hardly any rum. One of the worst drinks I've had in quite some time. Bad tasting and no feeling whatsoever on the brain. Avoid the Latin bartender with the red Henley. \nAt the table we ordered this stuff:\nDeviled eggs - how do they make such mini deviled eggs and why are they so bland? Tasted like yellow cream.\nBurger with an added egg - adequate but missing every flavor you want.\nShrimp Pasta - this was good!\nGreen beans - another hit!\nFries - the worst type in the world.. steak fries. Triple frying helped a little.\nPeanut Butter Lava Cake - the cake was not good, the filling better.\nButterscotch pudding - lacking a key ingredient... Butterscotch! Super meh\nSeems like this place is on it's way out, like the chef has moved on or is working on something else... like the restaurant is not a priority. Manager no longer responds to reviews here. Sad because this place could have been great."

The atmosphere is great and the food is excellent but nearly every time the service has been just okay or flat out terrible. The baked ricotta as everyone states is to die for, and the meatballs are also incredible so I really hope the staff can get their act together. Last night I think our server was Lisa, which we have had before and has been good in the past. Last night she was training a guy, which I'm sure can be difficult but I hate to make a bunch of excuses. I arrived later than my family and it took about 10 minutes to even acknowledge me and get my drink out on the table. I was told they were out of sangria which is a bummer so I ordered some black berry cocktail that was just subpar. I of course drank it way before the appetizer came out and would have loved to been offered another drink but never was. For the rest of my meal I had no other beverage, not even water. The trainee took our order on a notepad. My mom ordered the chicken to go for my dog (lol) the same time we all ordered our entrees. That food came out within 5 minutes! We're looking good... but then, only mine and my sister's meal come out. We tell one of the guys delivering it that we are still waiting on two more meals, in which he kindly said he would go check. Still haven't seen the waitress and about 15 minutes after that we see our trainee again in which we tell him we didn't receive two of the meals. He looked very confused and then went and finally ordered the entrees. I know he's new so I will cut him a break, but if you are writing it down how do you forget to ring it in? I don't even blame him though; he's new...but why wasn't he more closely followed or helped. I used to serve long ago so I didn't want to say anything but an apology should have happened and something should have been done to make up for the long wait it took to receive their food. I had to leave early to meet my friends, but by the time I left my mom's food was still not out. Hopefully, it was just a bad night for the both of them..."

Hearthstone is a pleasantly comfortable restaurant slash bar on the northern side of red rock casino. But don't be fooled, despite the warm entrance, lies a horrid truth. A dissatisfied empty stomach! Every meal on the list was completely overpriced but even that isn't what motivate such a low 2 star rating from me. Not only was I ignored by 1, but by 2 servers. I came in with 2 others and we sat at our table and each ordered 1 order of their unlimited wings for national wing day. Our friend also ordered 1 steak fries recommended by our waiter to share, having been told us the steak fries were perfect to share between the 3 of us. Laughable. The fries $8, were made from 1 single potato, consisting of 7 pieces. I counted.. It wasn't enough to feed a squirrel.. But besides our misleading waiter, what annoyed me was his lack to keep with our order. I also asked if we could use the check in offer on yelp for a glass of wine.. One that never came! When our food finally came out, instead of individual plates, we were given 1 plate to share the wings. But it didn't even compensate by adding more wings to the plate, it was simply done to make their serving easier on them. And when we asked for 1 more sauce cup, it also was lost along with our Houdini server. So we then asked Criss Angel, the chef who also vanished along with our nonexistent extra sauce as well. I was amazing at their vanishing act but left distressed in the process. It took 3 hours to get 2 dishes of wings.. All you can eat in the course of 12 hours?\n\nThe only single redeeming quality in service wasn't even from our host, but the water boy. He filled our water cups and our drinks and even tried to fill in and do the service that our host lacked at one point for him. I think this kid should take over and the waiter be demoted.\n\n**update in case there is a misunderstanding in this review. The wing day deal of 10$ per person was clear to us prior to coming here and we ordered it that way as well, there was no miscommunication on that. But what was disappointing was receiving 1 plate of wings for 3 separate unlimited wing orders. Instead of giving 3 individual plates to each of us, I mean, we did order separately, why are we all sharing on 1 plate for? If we all order steak dinner are we gonna be given 3 steaks on 1 plate or 3 plates with 1 steak? That's my issue. It created a shorter meal, longer wait time for our orders to come through, less sauce for our wings, and horrible service."

We sat outside to enjoy the gorgeous weather-the patio seating is definitely a huge plus. The server came over and took our drink order- which would turn out to be the only one of the night. (Big mistake- we are drinkers, which would have only resulted in a larger tip for her). Never again did she ask if we were ready for another round, not to mention it took 15 minutes just to get water. Then it was time to order food. A friend asked if they had a particular kind of cheese. She waved her hand over the menu and says, \"this is it.\" Okay.... Great... we ordered 2 types. We were never informed of any specials they were having, either. Everyone then ordered the main course. 7 dishes came out- and the 8th, about 7 minutes later. (All drink glasses still empty) She never stayed long enough to give us the chance, between conversation,  to order another. We finished our meals and ordered dessert. They all came out...without silverware. We were then informed that they had no clean spoons available and we would have to eat the ice cream and butterscotch pudding with a FORK. Seriously?! Yes, it was a Saturday night, but they were not busy. Several empty tables. The table next to us got up to get their own water at a nearby server station. Unacceptable. The food was good. The service was awful. Just awful. Walking out, we see the \"specials\" on the wall, and low and behold- the type of cheese my friend asked for at the beginning of the night- was one of them! At that point- our experience was comical. Don't think we will be back for a long time- if ever. Too many other amazing options Summerlin, with guaranteed stellar service. Hearthstone, your staff needs some extensive training. Good luck."

The dip was zesty (if you like miracle whip) but there was not enough of if. We moved on and ordered the baked ricotta, roasted squash, grilled broccoli & the chick pea salad. I know it sounds like a lot of food but we took our time and the portions are very moderate so it was not over the top. Everything they served was well presented and very yummy, expecially the baked ricotta with the truffle honey. We hadto ask for more bread!! Service was very good and attentive.

To start things off our waitress told us she didn't know that ham was pork lol & wasn't sure if the beef short rib meat balls were pork or beef. . Reviews read that portions are on the small side & priced a bit high.  I think it's true, but well executed. Only downfall was we found a huge chunk of white plastic in our mushroom pizza.. Didn't stop me from finishing it though. The situation was handled professionally and we were offered dessert and the pizza was on the house. Overall a great edition to the city and I'm 99% sure will be back."

First, \"Roasted Artichokes\" for $15 turned out to be 3/4 of a very small artichoke bottom, on top of cooked parsnip cubes and fried scallions.  You could buy 20 small artichokes in a store for $15.  There were more parsnips and scallions than artichokes, but no mention of them on the menu.  \"Lollipop Chicken Wings\" for $18 was just so-so.  10 tiny drumettes, drowning in a spicy, creamy sauce, with 4 raw veggie sticks.  \"Black Truffle Hangar Steak\" for $33 is an ordinary tasting hangar steak with 4 potato logs.  Couldn't distinguish truffle in the steak or sauce.  Not sure we would want to go again to try other menu items since this meal for 2 people with 1 alcoholic drink and 1 iced tea was almost $100."

Ultimately, while the menu sounds pretty good the restaurant is truly nothing special. The big issue was service, which I will mostly attribute to dining outside but who knows. Long wait for the menus, for the drinks, for refills, for the check...etc. Food came out quickly though. But then of course the food was nothing to rave about. Three things ordered: truffle chicken pizza, hanger steak, and lobster roll. The pizza was good but basically just tasted like a white pizza, the hanger steak was fine but nothing special, and the lobster roll was also fine but kind of bland. Food portions were pretty small and the bill was upwards of $100 which seems like a lot for what we got. Ultimately, if I have a choice between this and ordering 50 quesalupas from t bell I will choose the latter."

In the course of 3 hours, my bottomless Bellini was refilled 2.5 times (the first glass they served me was a little over half full!). I also had to ask the waiter to refill it each time. The Bellinis were pre-made and served from a pitcher. They tasted more like peach juice and hardly had any champagne. The bottomless bloody beers were nothing special. I would prefer bottomless bloody Mary's or bottomless mimosas like the other local restaurants who serve brunch. The $70-75 for a bottle of vodka or bottle of champagne to make your own drinks was overpriced. The staff was friendly, but unorganized and slow. Won't go back for the drinks, but the restaurant was beautiful and food was delicious!"

Which  was water with ice and maybe a half of shot of vodka for $11. We\nAll order the unlimited wings which 3 people had to share while other tables has a plate to each person. We weren't the waitress friends like the table next to use. We had the bust boy doing our drinks and re ordering he had better customer services then the waitress. Wow the wings were amazing but it was pathetic to have to eat one plate wait 20+ mins for the second plate. By our 3rd plate they had run out of wings yet the people next to us had each a plate each for 5 people fresh \"out of wings\" by 9pm when you open at 5pm. She then tried to charge us $17 per person when the hostess and website had said $10 per person all you can eat. She had the greatest comment of all \"you guys ate the most wings out of all my customers tonight\" gees thanks 2 grown men and 1 girl  we ate 3 plates that had maybe 12 wings not hooters/Pizza Hut/wing stop/ buffalo wings size these wings are called lollipop wings for a reason they are small! The steak friends were a joke I had no steak on them one full potato cut into small pieces. I also had a issued with my card really!!! Did you try to actually run it. What a miracle you try a second time and have no issues. Well I guess I'll have to keep going somewhere, else. Sucks food was great but customer services was a joke they might as well have a place to order and pick up avoided the waitresses."

Hearthstone seemed like it would hit the spot, and that it sure did. \n\nMy dad opted for the fried chicken with an apple slaw and biscuit while I went with the lobster roll with skinny fries, we shared the green beans which were cooked in bacon and topped with almonds and were legit the best green beans I've ever eaten, albeit probably the most fattening. \n\nFried chicken was delicious and moist. Huge serving with a biscuit that had melted cheese over the top. The apple slaw was also quite good, even to my father who proclaims his distaste for any type of cole slaw.\n\nLobster roll was buttery deliciousness with huge chunks of lobster perfectly coated with whatever their mayo mixture is. The whole thing was devoured. Fries were fries - good but everything else was great. \n\nMy dad got the strawberry margarita while I sipped on the endless refills of water. Drink was okay, I probably wasn't the best judge of drinks at that particular moment, I was alcoholed out. \n\nService was friendly and super fast as well as informative. Our waitress recommended the green beans to us and as I already expressed my love for them, she did not disappoint. \n\nSeems to be a bit pricey for what you get however. $25 for friend chicken, $28 for a lobster roll (the lobster did taste very fresh and was cooked to perfection however). Not sure if this is due to being in the resort or not. I would recommend for hotel guests absolutely, locals however probably know where to find other quality food that isn't as highly priced."

Since my schedule is so busy we didn't get to go until today. \n\nI must say that they made such a great effort to make this experience a good one. The service was excellent, drinks were refilled and we were checked on more than the last time. We did notice that the menu is alot smaller, which they explained was due to seasonal menu changes and items. Some items were no longer offered, like the infamous \"crabby snacks\". Let's just hope I don't get harassed again by John M., whose girlfriend works there becuase I didn't give it a 10 stars. LOL. People need to relax, we're giving our opinion about the food and experience.\n\nThank you to Peter V., for inviting us back as it truly changed our perspective. Everyone was very hospitable and we were rendered excellent service. \n\nWe ordered: \nBakes ricotta and truffle honey- \nthis is a must order and always a winner!\nSteak Tartar with poached egg-\nYes, this time it came (we ordered it on the last visit and it never came, lol). This was seasoned perfectly and just the right amount of pickles, the egg made this dish extra rich and delicious. Make sure to ask for extra toast.\nMeatballs-\nThey were good, moist and tasty. The tart tomato sauce was a good compliment.\nTomato Bisque-\nthe bisque was tart and just a hint of sweetness. They served it with a cheese and salami sandwich to dip. Very good. \n\nMain Entr\u00e9es \nShrimp Pasta-\nThis shrimp and pasta was topped with bread crumbs that gave it a great texture. The sauce was rich and pasta was cooked perfectly.\nHanger Steak-\nAnother great dish, cooked to temperature. We ordered rare. But the steak fries were a bit salty for our taste.\nWild Salmon-\nPoached then oven baked, moist and delicious. \nHamburger-\nWe order two and they both were cooked to temperature. These were really good, but the steak fries were a bit salty for our taste."

Love it! \nWe got a charcuterie board with salami, pepperoni and pecorino cheese with stone ground mustard and truffle honey. I could have eaten the honey by itself with a straw but I didn't wanna be that weird person lol\n\nThe baked ricotta was hands down the best thing we tried. It came in a deep dish and was still warm from the oven. Again with truffle honey\n\nShort Rib Meatballs were delicious and paired very well with the goat cheese underneath.\n\nThe DOC pizza was the only thing I didn't care for. It was  good, but lacking flavor. Crust was very thin and flimsy. Buffalo mozzarella needed some salt to set off the flavor. The pizza itself didn't have much sauce either. But I ate it because I love pizza and I refuse to send food back.\n\nThe Wagyu Short Rib Burger was delicious. Perfect portion and had a side of fries. Fries were GF free too!  \n\n\nService was fantastic! Ryan A was our server, did a menu walk thru and gave recommendations. If you come in, sit in his section, he was very knowledgable ! \n\n\nAt the end of our meal we decided that we would rather drive all the way up from deep henderson to eat here than deal with the hustle and bustle of the strip. \nAmazing find!"

This time, I went by myself and sat at the bar where I could watch the cooks doing their thing.\n\nI ordered the baked ricotta, the poached king salmon, and the peanut butter lava cake.  The baked ricotta was served with truffle honey and toast points.  Very tasty.  I did let one of the pieces of bread go back so I didn't fill up with that.  I'm not much of a honey person but the honey on the toast and then the hot ricotta on top made for a combination that was very good.\n\nThe poached salmon was excellent.  Perfectly cooked, it was a nice pink inside.  The salmon sat on a bed of eggplant, chick peas, and herbed yogurt.  An excellent, healthy main course.\n\nI asked my server about two possible dessert choices.  His recommendation--the peanut butter lava cake--and his suggestion was great.  The peanut butter cake was filled with wonderful butterscotch that oozed out when I broke the surface.  There was also some brown butter ice cream served with the cake.\n\nThe hour and a half I spent here was a lot of fun!

The hostess was so attentive and kept checking in with us and updating us on their status. Loved that! Once we got our booth, I looked up to see their specials of the evening and was soooo so excited to have the Florida stone crab & clam chowder in a bread bowl!!! Unfortunately, we were sat at 6:30 pm and told the specials ran out \"10 minutes ago\" bummer. Major bummer, but the lesson here is MAKE A RES. and get your orders in for specials, early!\n\nSo, moving on to the meal, I had a hard time deciding on anything once the specials fell through, since I had a taste for clam chowder and crab now, but I really enjoyed my glass of Educated Guess Cab, and was sooo excited they had it on their wine list. +1 for that! Eventually the fella and I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, beet salad and a meatball flat bread. The dates texture was off for me - the bacon wasn't crisped, and soggy bacon fat was not pleasant. The flavor was awesome though- good garlic, tomato and smokey flavor from bacon. Lesson here, order them extra crispy, maybe?? Could be a really yummy dish when crisped up.\n\nI moved on to the beet salad and had my MIND BLOWN, so completely that I didn't even care about the dates anymore, and was only slightly sad about the crab and chowder :). Seriously though, if you are a fan of the beet/goat cheese relationship, you must must order this salad!\n\nThe flat bread was also delicious, but the salad had all of my attention. We also enjoyed really great and fun service. Our server didn't rush us as we sat for a loooong time drinking wine and mulling over the menu trying to decide. She was so patient, all smiles and offered us plenty of suggestions. The hostess checking in with is while we waited for a booth in the beginning also sticks out for me as GREAT hospitality, and you definitely won me over in hospitality."

Open atmosphere and great intimate lighting only to be thrown off by a bunch of big screen TV's all over the place with the football game on. A mix between a sports bar and a really nice restaurant. \n\nService here was impeccable. Hostess, server, waiter, down to the restaurant manager. All very nice, attentive, and on top of everything. \n\nThe food here is where this place really shines. \n\nWe ordered pretty much the entire menu:\n\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates - awesome\n\nMeat and Cheese board - great!\n\nBaked Ricotta dish - my favorite!\n\nCalamari - great\n\nChicken Truffle Flatbread - great\n\nMeatball and ricotta flatbread - delicious\n\nApple and quinoa salad - great!\n\nScallops - Cooked perfectly\n\nHanger Steak - good, next time I should order it medium.  \n\nPeanut butter lava cake - Fire! So good!\n\nChocolate Souffl\u00e9 - good, not worth the 15 minute wait\n\n\nGreat place with great food! Will definitely be back - especially to try the brunch!"

            "review": "I have never written a bad review, and I really wanted to like this place, with the cute and trendy decor, but it was extremely disappointing. Service was very very slow and the server was abrupt and couldn't answer extremely basic questions about menu items. As and server myself, I try to cut everyone some slack, but this was pretty substandard, especially for a restaurant with this price point. I went for Sunday brunch for a friend's birthday. I ordered the bottomless bellinis for 24 dollars, which I only got 3 of over the course of 2.5 hrs, while having to wait 15-20 min after I finished each beverage. Also, even though the waiter said the bottomless drinks were pre-made, every drink I received tasted extremely different, with one being all champagne to one being extremely sweet and juicy. The same inconsistencies were applied to the other bottomless bloody beers my friends ordered, the first one being extremely tomato based, and others being beer heavy. I also ordered the D. O. C. Pizza (18 dollars for personal sized pizza), which is basically a margarita pizza. I would say that 4 of the 8 pieces had just plain marinara and nothing else (not even cheese or herbs), and the other 4 pieces had small circles of lukewarm cheese and about 5 small pieces of basil over the entire pizza. My friend ordered the California Egg Benedict, and the egg whites were translucent and runny and inedible unless you like mostly raw egg. We wanted to send our food back, but since we were at the restaurant at the request of our friend for her birthday, we didn't want to complain or cause a scene. Overall, my extremely awful excuse for a pizza and drinks were 42 bucks before tax and tip, and I honestly can say little caesars take out pizza is inifnitely better. I feel like the trendiness of the decor coupled with the wine/charcuterie vibe of the place is giving it hype, but I would never return to pay this much for food or beverages for brunch or any other meal. Try Mercadito next door. Really great food and delicious cocktails.\n\nI've been a server in high end restaurants for years and spending money has never been an issue for me as long as the food/drink quality and service were worth it, but definitely not for hearthstone. I wouldn't pay half of what I paid."

            "review": "It is so hard no to compare this place to a similar restaurant called Culinary Dropout (located in the Hard Rock). The ambiance, the style, the server's appearance, and the menu make you think (if you have been to Culinary Dropout) that these 2 places are related in someway. Anyway I decided to take my Mom here for Christmas dinner and I think I made a good choice. Made reservations (which I really dont think I needed) for 3:30pm, so kind of a late lunch/early dinner. Overall, was very happy with the experience. There were a few things that could have been better. We ordered Deviled Eggs as an appetizer (which were excellent by the way) but either the server forgot to put the order in, or thought we wanted them with our meal. Our entrees came out before the appetizer and we had to remind him that we ordered the appetizer. Once we reminded him they did come out right away.\n\nNow on to the main entrees. My Mom ordered the fried chicken. The portions were huge (4 big pieces) and the skin was excellent. Good portion of cole slaw and a nice size biscuit accompanied this meal. And she ordered the \"Crispy Steak Fries\" as a side. There was nothing special about those, except the size. They are very thick. The menu states that they come with a smokey ketchup. I asked the server if that is the case and he stated it was just a regular ketchup. I ordered the Pappardelle Pasta, which consisted of braised short ribs, ricotta, natural braising juices, & piquillo pepper. My only complaint about this meal was the size of the pasta. It was too wide for my liking, but that is just me. It was about an inch in width, and long. You pretty much need a knife to cut it in to smaller pieces. But overall it had a great flavor. And to accompany this, I ordered the creamed corn. This was excellent. Just the right consistency. \n\nWhat meal wouldn't be complete without dessert. I ordered the peanut butter lava cake. I would have preferred just a plain vanilla ice cream with this. It comes with a banana/brown butter ice cream. Just left kind of a weird aftertaste. But the cake, the filling, and whipped cream were excellent.\n\nI would definitely come back. Maybe I'll try brunch should I do come back."

The manager came up and apologized. Nice guy and he got us a couple of drinks and didn't charge us for that plate, which was more than we expected. My only real complaint is the hostess. The first time I went, I didn't have a reservation and she tried to sit us a community table, even though the place was empty. Second time I went I had a reservation, and still didn't get seated for almost 20 minutes after the reservation. The place was almost empty again. The waiter said that they want to be the neighborhood spot for locals, so if that's the case, they should let the hostess know not to seat people without reservations at such a bad table. I'm sure that they'll work out the kinks soon and have the place flowing properly though. It's defiantly worth it just for the food."

I really like to come just hang out here for drinks to soak in the atmosphere. Depending on what day you come, you will see a bunch of total white washed summerlin yuppies super dressed up thinking they are all that and a bag of chips. Quite entertaining. Or you can find the average Joe- but I did notice a lot of really white people.. So anyways. Haha \n\nThe bathrooms are outside to the right in the casino, kinda annoying no bathrooms in the location but at least it is not too far. They also have a semi large room with a private table for large parties you can reserve that looks fun. \n\nThe food here is fresh and fun. A bit high on the price point for my liking. Entrees including streaks run from around $33 to $55. I got the $50 something dollar filet that was supposed to be 10 ounces and by the time I cut off the bone, it was a 6 oz steak. It also does not come with sides so you have to order a $10 side to make it a meal(3 sides to choose from). The showstopper of the night was their watermelon salad which may be seasonal. The feta with the nuts and sweet melon made my mouth sing. The peanut butter dessert recommended my the waitress was also Delish. \n\nService was very slow. Waited about 20 minutes initially even to get a drink. We were not in a hurry really but it was annoying to wait that long initially. Just give me my drink and I'll wait for food. But I need my drink! Overall, don't think I would eat here again cause just too expensive for what you get. The food was great though!"

For a person who takes pictures of nearly every plate that's set in front of her, it's very telling that I can't remember anything I've eaten there.  Maybe I had too much wine, but it's more likely that everything I've had was just as expected - nothing more, nothing less. \n\nWhat I do remember is solid service, good wine, and a great ambience.  They have a great outdoor patio and the vibe is trendy and upscale.   While the dinner menu is nice, I'd highly recommend going for brunch.  I went with a few days on what turned out to be Easter Sunday and we had a great time.  (OH! I just remembered - we had oysters! Just as I had pondered above, they were good - just as expected, nothing mind-blowing, but good.)  They had everything you want during brunch - a great ambience, great waitstaff, and your choice of mimosas or bloody mary's (of which, we had neither - we opted for a few bottle of the Conundrum white wine, delicious, if you're wondering).\n\nI'm giving this 4 stars, mainly for the ambience, but also because I remember \nbeing happy with the food, so maybe I'll blame my memory on the wine..."

He is the only one who shouted so loud and everybody was looking at him, yet the host lady sat us right in front of this guy. So we requested to be seated in another quieter corner again. \nThe host lady is friendly, but didn't pay much attention to what the customer really wants. \n\nThe restaurants is big and modern, it's a bit cucina enoteca-ish with a sport bar touch. \n\nYou needs to order the suckling pig one day in advance, so no roasted suckling pig for us. \n\n-++ Wood roasted octopus: The octopus is a bit chewy, however together with the nice saba glaze and the other ingredient on the plate, it's a a hearty bites. It didn't wow me, but it wasn't bad either. \n\n--+Carbonara pizza: The pizza smells great, the flat pizza wasn't very thin, the pizza dough is a bit thick and chewy, it's like eating New York style pizza. The pancetta is inedible, because of the extremely saltines. If the pancetta is fat, it could be a nice bite, however the pancetta is lean, that makes the meat overly salted. We needs to scratch off the pancetta from the pizza, it's a pity, because it smells really great. \n---Rotisserie chicken: The chicken meat was a bit powdery, but it's pretty juicy and tender, until we almost finish the chicken and we realized, the juicy and the tenderness of the chicken is not because of their cooking skill, it's because the chicken is raw. The chicken meat close to the bone, about half inch is raw.  \nWe told the manager about it, she came and saw the chicken was almost \"finished\", she still charge us for the raw rotisserie chicken, because she thought we almost finished the chicken. Well, if I didn't dig into the chicken, how would I know the meat inside of the chicken is raw? \n---Clam with crushed tomatoes: The clam is fishy and tasteless. There is no salt in this dish at all.  And there is no tomato inside this dish, not even a piece of tomato skin. The manager did refund us the dish, because there is no crushed tomato in the dish. \n\n--+ Heartstone secrets dessert: It looks fun, because the balls were black(soaked in berry juice) and it's topped with flower. It was pretty chunky and very sweet.  \n\nThe service from the manager is off because the manager refund the money for the stale clams, but not for the raw chicken. The reason for not refund the chicken is because we almost finished the chicken. That's not logical. \nIf the chicken contain salmonella, the money to get a lawyer should be more expensive than the refund I assumed. \n\nNot so smart!"

Unfortunately, they decided to do a pre set menu with very limited options.  They had an option of AYCE for $35 per person but your entire group had to do that which was kinda ridiculous.  The options I can remember for food were buffalo wings,  meatball sub,  cheese burger,  french dip,  buffalo chicken sandwich,  pepperoni pizza, fried mac and cheese bites and a truffle popcorn.  They also had a seasoned popcorn for free.  \n\nThe seasoned popcorn they put out was so salty we couldn't eat it.  I asked for a bowl of plain popcorn which was much better. I also tried the mac and cheese bites and pizza.  The only reason we finished the pizza is because i was starving.  It was thin crust but had a soggy texture. For $21 I was really expecting a good quality pizza not some frozen mess.  The mac and cheese bites were flavorless,  we didn't even finish them. \n\nShortly after I regrettably ordered my pizza the waitress came and told us that they would be opening the full menu shortly.  Wait,  what? You told us earlier that this was the only food options and they couldn't be modified because they were prepared that morning. They told my friend she couldn't change the cheese on the burger because of this.  I'm not sure if it was mixed in the burger or if the waitress was just not properly informed. We received mixed answers for different questions depending on so we asked which was quite frustrating.  \n\nThe place had a great atmosphere but the service and food left much to be desired which is why I probably won't return."

First they have 2 entrances so I came in one side and another friends came in the other. I was seated with the promise that my friends at the other door would be seated with me as well. However I had to text them to see where they were and they was still waiting? The hostess clearly didn't communicate with the other. \n\nAfter we were seated, we were served water right away. After 10 minutes our server came by and we ordered drinks. Our server then disappeared. Our drinks came but we waited 45 minutes before our server came back around to take our food order. That was pretty disappointing... But she was friendly and thankfully we had our drinks. The Blackberry cocktail was very tasty. \n\nThe food was delicious!!! The Baked Ricotta was seriously to die for, and steak tartare was superb and the meatballs were amazing!!! We also had the Mac and Cheese with the cauliflower which was different and surprising a great compliment. I was only disappointed in the Roasted Squash. It was bland and over cooked. \n\nIt was my birthday so we obviously ordered dessert. Can you believe on the dessert menu, they didn't have a single chocolate item?! So we ordered the peanut butter and butterscotch molten cake and WOW!!! It was so different but in a good way and didn't make me miss the chocolate dessert at all! \n\nThe price was good too. 5 small plates and endless cocktails split between 4 girls and it was only $50 each. Pretty decent! I'll definitely be back. They had a lot of items on the menu I'd love to try!"

            "review": "This is my second review because I've tried many many more dishes! My favorite thing by far was the baked ricotta wow it was really amazing. Especially with the honey on top! Great flavors and even the toast that came with it was good. \n\nThe short rib meat balls were very tasty. The steak tartar with the poached egg was really great but I actually wish the toast that came with it didn't have truffle. Usually I love truffle but I think it overpowered the tartar a bit and was hard to finish it all with that. Next time I'll ask for plain toast I think! The lollipop wings were cooked perfectly nice and crispy but I actually think the buffalo sauce was too thick and tasted too ordinary (like something from a much cheaper place) to be on such a good cut of wings. We had the bacon wrapped dates because they said they had an extra and gave it to is (very sweet of them) and it was good for what it was but I wouldn't have ordered it because I'm not crazy about bacon and dates are a bit too thick and sweet for me. I had the shrimp pasta since multiple waiters had recommended it and I was surprisingly not loving it! I can't put my finger on what it was but it just did not \"wow\" me but the shrimp was good quality. We also had the truffle hanger steak which was good but not incredible. \n\nFor desserts I have had the chocolate chip souffl\u00e9 and the peanut butter lava cake. The souffl\u00e9 is definitely good but not amazing enough for me to actively crave it. The peanut butter cake was good as well but again not perfect. It comes with some sort of butterscotch (pudding I think?) which I actually think did not go with it very well. It actually interfered with the peanut butter flavor and sort of overpowered it all with it's sweetness and butterscotch flavor. I'd say something similar for the roasted banana ice cream. If it was just banana ice cream that would have worked better because the roasted ness made it much sweeter (like more saccharine) and didn't pair as well with the already really sweet cake.  Once I pushed it all aside, the cake itself is really good well made and good flavor. \n\nOverall I am leaving my rating at 4 stars because although I enjoy many things here I am not obsessed with enough dishes for how expensive everything is. The price mostly reflects the quality but some of the flavors on each dish could be tweaked to \"wow\" me more and really deserve my money because some dishes were a bit unbalanced with it's flavors. I'm sure I will be back though!"

Not only was Shane so great to us but I noticed how he went from table to table making sure everyone was enjoying their food and service. Our waiters were also wonderful! And the food...SO good.

Then a alternate also not available.\nFortunately, 3rd choice was.\nWaitress verbally recited 2 specials. One being lamb chops. Said it was a huge portion of 36 ounces.  Realizing she said 3 chops it was probably three 6 oz chops. Which is what it was. Reasonable portion but not 36 oz.\nStaff is not trained well. Polite but aloof.\nWe all three ordered 4 appetizers. Wings, 2 orders because waitress said they were small. She was right about that. Octopus was slimy and not fresh. Dates were good, again very small portions.\nSalad order only came out for 2 of us. Waitress no where to be found. Even server delivering dropped salad and ran without asking if we needed anything.\nOther salad eventually came out with dinner but we had to ask for it.\nBus person wanted me to keep my fork after appetizer.\nNo place mat. I guess I was supposed to put dirty utensil on table or just hold it.\nNo check back until dinner was over.\nThis place was more than half empty. \nService is below par because of what appears lack of training. This was my second visit. Friends also stated similar experiences from their past visits.\nLamb was very good and a reasonable portion more salt than I prefer though. Friend said salmon was the saltiest he ever had.\nWill not return. The value is not there. When service is bad the desire to return is lost.\nIt's too bad because the place is a beautiful environment."

Hearthstone is a farm to table feel american restaurant that offers some unique twists that make it a definite place to try. \n\nAll of their flatbreads are worth a shot, my favorite is the Abe Froman... not sure who that guy is, but the (not overpowering) fennel goes really well with the garlic sausage.  \n\nCeviche was good but not great... but i am more of a traditionalist on this one... why ruin a good thing and add watermelon to a dish like this? But all the cool kids have new takes on ceviche these days so i get it i guess. \n\nMeatballs: great. Tuna tartare: fantastic. But really if you want to do it right, get a group of friends together and go with the whole suckling pig. Had a chance to do this at a yelp event earlier this year and it was one of my best dining experiences of the last several months IMO. If you can get past the little eyes looking at you (which i quickly did), you will definitely enjoy this. They even come out to the table to cut it up and serve. Cool, but i hear tends to scare the other customers (get over it). \n\nAlso try their private cellar on Thursday. Cant beat free wine."

            "review": "We've been to Hearthstone several times and we really enjoy the restaurant. Tonight we tried three new (to us) dishes, and one old favorite. Surprisingly, only the old favorite was less than perfect. The new:  the Crab Cake appetizer was one large, very meaty crab cake with a nice crust, that came with a tasty slaw;  the rock shrimp lettuce cups had beautiful pieces of lettuce to wrap around very tasty shrimp; the fried chicken turned out to be four large pieces of juicy, mostly white meat chicken in an exceptionally addicting coating. All these were delicious. The disappointment was  the pasta shrimp, a dish I had had maybe four times previously, and each time it was the dish that I talked about for days after the meal and it was the dish that brought me back for more. I normally don't get spaghetti dishes, but I got this one because this dish used to have a light, distinctive sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Tonight the dish was different. Tonight the sauce was a heavy, creamy, spicy sauce. They warned me about the spice and the spice was not a problem. In fact the dish itself was not really a problem. It was good. The problem was that the dish was different than it had been the four previous times I ordered it. It was creamy and heavy, not light, and that's not what it used to be. So I was disappointed because I ordered expecting one thing based on my previous visits to the restaurant, but I got something that was entirely different."

I'd have to come again and try some of their other items to really see if this place truly deserves a thumbs up or thumbs down... we will see.\n\nI had a Sangria, which was pretty darn strong and the waitress was nice enough to remake it for me. \n\nI also had their braised short rib meatballs in tomato sauce and it was a bit spicy for my taste. It was still decent, but I've definitely tasted better. Waaaay better.\n\nMy husband had the chocolate shuffle and he wasn't really impressed by it not 1 bit or should I say bite. He also had their house cabernet and we both agreed that $16 a glass seemed like a rip off.\n\nOverall our bill for 1 dessert,  small meatballs tapas, 1 cocktail, 1 glass of red wine  for $60 and then add a 15% tip was a little overkill. I really don't mind spending a good amount of money on fancy food, but it has to taste good and this just did not.\n\nIn a nutshell this was a little too high for food that was very poorly executed, but this won't be my last visit. I still look forward to seeing what else this place has to offer.\n\nAt this point I would only recommend this place for drinks and thats about it for now. Until next time foodie friends!"

She offered to seat me at a table, in which i declined . I prefer to sit at the bar so I sat myself! Sat at the bar and was immediately greeted and dropped menus. One for happy hour (who doesn't love happy hour) a full dinner menu and a drink menu. After looking over the menu I ordered the happy hour buffalo wings as a recommendation from the bartender. WOW. Simple, to the point and SO BOMB! I don't like spicy food so I was hesitant but tried it anyways. Six bucks how can I lose? Not too spicy, little tangy and mouthwatering! Should have taken a picture before eating because they were gone before I remembered. Next I ordered the shrimp ceviche off the dinner menu. It's a different twist on the traditional ceviche I am used to but another winner! Easily! This one I got a picture of first before devouring! Has little chunks of watermelon in it. Yummy and very refreshing! Paired this one with a nice Pinot Grigio  by the glass, they carry one of my favorites Santa Margarita! Have j told you how I love this place? Lastly I ordered the Hanger steak, medium rare! I got it and was impressed and also thankful! Yes... Thankful lol They cut the steak for you before sending it out! Saves you time and you can just get down to business, lol! They cooked it to my liking and the steak fries that come with it.. YUM! Sarah the manager came by asked how everything was I told her I love this place and can't wait to share my future experiences with friends! See you again real soon Hearthstone!

            "review": "There are so many things I really like about Hearthstone. Unfortunately, the things I do not like cloud the experience there.  In spite of the major issue I have with Hearthstone, I will definitely come back.  It's the kind of place I want to work. And the issue is incredibly \"fixable.\"\n\nThe issue is the service. The employees are very kind and accommodating. My issue is not with the staff but with the system of service. Let me say this was my second meal at Hearthstone and the service during the first meal was abysmal. But the restaurant was new and I was looking forward to getting back to see what changes had been made. While their service has progressed by leaps and bounds, there are still some confusing missteps that keep this place from being an excellent venue. \n\nIt begins when you call. I called a few times the same day (for different reasons) and each time the phone was answered with an informal yet relatively friendly, \"Hello.\" I was taken aback each time and had to ask on the last call if I had even reached the business.  I don't know the last time I made a reservation and did not hear the name of the business.  It's an odd experience to have to say, \"Is this Hearthstone?\"\n\nThen there were issues at the hostess stand. The hostess was friendly and sorted everything out, but there were very serious communication issues at the hostess stand during our first visit as well. This seems to be an area they need to tighten up. We arrived on time for our reservation and were content to wait at the hostess stand to be helped. While we were waiting for the hostess to return another couple stepped behind us. After a few minutes, the man behind us become frustrated and went to go find the hostess. When he returned with the hostess behind him, she apologized to him and his guest and was preparing to seat them without even acknowledging us. We had to tell her that we had been waiting longer and expected to be seated first. She apologized (this time to us) and seated us. \n\nWhen we sat down we were promptly forgotten and had to ask a manager for menus. People seated some time after us were ordering food by the time we received a menu. Not a huge deal and the waiter was very kind. But it was another odd glitch in service that just doesn't serve this space well. \n\nOnce we made contact with our waiter, service was fantastic and we enjoyed our experience. The space has the earthy/industrial vibe that so many places have. But they marry it well with Italian country kitchen touches so that it feels less industrial and more warm. It feels good to be in there. And they get lots of light, so an early dinner means you will enjoy plenty of natural light even if you are not sitting on the patio. \n\nThe menu is simple/rustic and thoughtful. Lots of flatbreads, charcuterie, and small bites appetizers make for varied options when ordering. We tasted the meat and cheese board, deviled eggs, roasted broccoli, arugula salad, baked ricotta (OUTSTANDING), marinara flatbread, and popcorn. Everything was very tasty and well prepared. I love that they let the simple ingredients shine. Of all the dishes we enjoyed, only one (deviled eggs) did not reach its potential.\n\nI like the tapas/small plates explosion because it allows people to try more dishes without having to commit to a large portion. The menu at Hearthstone is one of their strengths. It is simple and I love that the offerings all \"go together\". You can order a few of the small bites, a few appetizers, a flatbread, and a main course and feel a sort of cohesion to the food and ingredients.  Unlike some tapas places, the food items here are generally familiar. They take simple ingredients and prepare them thoughtfully with a small (and very safe) twist. For example, you have had ricotta cheese before, no doubt.  You may not have had ricotta with truffle honey and gouda on toast. Hearthstone offers this delectable dish I want to return for.\n\nOverall: The food is simple, well prepared, rustic(ish), and most importantly, tasty.  If they weren't also attempting (like most restaurants) to offer an experience, I would ONLY judge them on the food. But they are and I can't. I have to look at the totality of my experience at Hearthstone and say that they have the potential to be a really great local restaurant. The service issues are \"small\" but consistent and frequent. And unfortunately those issues take away from my experiences with the appetizing food at Hearthstone."

The jalapeno hummus had no kick to it at all:  it just tasted like regular hummus, nothing special.  The chickpea salad had too much of a vinegar flavor for my taste.  The roasted chicken was OK, but the juice that was served with it was sweet instead of savory, and I didn't care for it very much.  The presentations were nice, but the flavor didn't hold up.\n\nWe were seated at a table with chairs, and after the first hour of waiting for our food, the seats were very uncomfortable.  Our table was next to a carving station where they cut up the whole suckling pigs that are an option on the menu.  While some people might enjoy watching a pig get carved up, we did not.  And the smell of the roasted pig detracted from our experience.\n\nHearthstone was loud, had poor service, and mediocre food.  We won't be back.

It was called \"kegs and eggs.\"\n\nIt had to be one of the worst planned events I have ever attended. Well, maybe that's being a little bit dramatic....This event was advertised for MONTHS. We made reservations via Open Table and closer to the date, we tried to call for information. Neither the hostess or Manager were able to provide any, all the way up until the DAY BEFORE. Perhaps that should've been a warning.\n\nThey kept telling us that they were \"putting the final touches on the menu,\" however the actual menu was not any different than what they normally offer for brunch. The only addition was the Nate from Bad Beat had a table set up in the back of the restaurant, where he was giving out samples of beer. That's awesome, but I live 5 minutes from the brewery and didn't need to drive all the way to Summerlin for that.\n\nThere seemed to be A LOT of miscommunication. When we arrived to check in for our table, they tried to seat us on the patio. It was hotter than hell and there wasn't a single other person out there. Um, no thank you, we'll take a table inside. They didn't have a table inside and ended up sitting us at the end of one of their high-top large tables. It was really weird.\n\nThe service overall was really lacking. Our server was painfully slow and when it was time to cash out, he kept our change as a tip without asking.\n\nI wasn't overall impressed with the food either. I ordered the California Bennie. I think the menu should be more specific and mention that there is NO bread as part of this dish. Instead of brioche or an english muffin, the bottom half is a large slice of tomato. I was expecting there to be bread, topped with a small slice of tomato and everything else. It was really not great. \n\nAnyhow, the decor is really cute and it's bright and open and cheery. Unfortunately, it just came off to me like a place where hipster-ish people were going to be \"seen,\" rather than a place that stands on it's food and service."

            "review": "This was my first time at Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar. Came here for their $55 Thanksgiving dinner, left unsatisfied and disappointed. The Thanksgiving menu was a 3-course prix fixe. First course was butternut squash soup or roasted beet salad. No complaints here. Butternut squash soup was good, actually the best part of the entire meal. Roasted beet salad was nothing special, but wasn't bad either. Then the meal started to go seriously downhill. Main course was organic herb-roasted turkey with gravy, mashed potatoes, creamed green beans, and sourdough stuffing. In all honestly the turkey wasn't overly dry and the gravy was tasty. Standard mashed potatoes and stuffing, substandard green beans. What really irked me was the portion size, especially for a $55 set menu. This was closer to a kid's meal or appetizer in terms of portion size - very disappointing, especially for a holiday synonymous with gluttony (actually left hungry and I'm not a big eater). Then came dessert: pumpkin spiced cheesecake or apple pie. Little did I know the desserts would make the portion size of the main course look enormous by comparison. The desserts were practically bite-sized, literally the size of the desserts you see at the dessert bar at Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. Even with all of the above, I wouldn't have felt the need to come to Yelp and leave a two-star review if the service was even acceptable. My drink was never once refilled for the entire meal, even though the server clearly saw an empty glass when bringing the main course, dessert, and extra silverware or when he came to clean empty plates from the table multiple times. He actually DID come and grab my empty glass after I had already finished dessert, but that was not to refill it apparently as I never got a refilled drink and the only time he returned to the table after that was 5 minutes later to bring the check. And a different server bumped into me, dropped a used, dirty fork on the table in the process while muttering an insincere \"sorry\" as he scurried off. Seriously?\n\nFor $55 +$4 for my drink, I feel like this meal was way overpriced and that's not even taking into account the terrible service throughout the meal. You can definitely get better food AND service for $70+/person. Will not be back."

And the great thing is when you order the food and share it all its not only an experience for your taste buds but also such a great social experience as well. \nFavorite dishes: Stuffed Date wrapped in Bacon and stuffed with Chorizo. Charred Octopus. Mushroom flatbread. Steak Tar Tar. Honey Truffle. \n\nThis is only a very small list of the dishes that I love. \n\nMy favorite drink MY BOY BLEU this drink is so amazingly perfect. It has Rosemary infused vodka, egg white, citrus liquor and does not disappoint. This is def worth going to Hearthstone for. \n\nGive this place a try. I love it and I bring my family in every time they come here and they cannot get enough. Great job!"

            "review": "I've been wanting to try this place and last night I finally went.  It was quite busy, since it was Saturday night and it is a new place.  The wait for a table was one hour at 8:00 p.m., but there was open seating at the coffee table at the back, so we went for that.  I love the decor and ambiance. The feeling is like being at a very laid back wealthy person's suburban or country home. Not flashy, but luxurious while remaining casual. \n\nThe service was good but the food was just OK.  My friend and I each had a cocktail ($12 each, which is the going rate these days) and we split the hummus, meatballs, and stuffed dates. \n\nThe hummus was served with flatbread that I liked, but the dip itself was NOT good. The texture was oddly fluffy and the flavor was lacking. Not bad, just bland. \n\nThe short rib meatballs were OK. Not worth $12 for three mediocre meatballs, but not bad. Just not special or very good. \n\nThe stuffed dates were OK. I have had these at a lot of other places (Firefly and Cafe BaBa Reeba, among them) and I think that they were also overpriced and just OK. \n\nOur tab, with the above was $60 before tip. I would go back for a drink and maybe to share different small plates but I am not in a hurry to go there again."

            "review": "Yup, this gets 3 stars for being \"A-OK\" (according to Yelp's wording). It's exactly what it was. Went for brunch with another experienced diner today, and we had both been eager to try out this place. Due to some of the following experiences, it seems the restaurant could use some polishing.\n\nBeing that this was a business meeting, I wasn't registering some mishaps, nor did I want to deviate from the conversation. But, I left unsatisfied from the meal, womp womp:\n\nThe patio, where we sat, was quite lovely. (No wait today at 11:30 on a Sunday, but we had made a reservation.) The sun moved its way over over the course of the meal so I started working on a neck tan.\n\nThe waitress didn't come over for some time, and when she did, she got the job done. No frivolities. I barely got in my coffee order because she had taken my entree and didn't ask if I wanted any coffee or something to drink.\n\nMenu looked great and I ordered the California Benedict and a coffee. My acquaintance ordered the salted caramel French toast. When the plates were presented, the dishes looked very appealing.\n\nMy coffee didn't arrive until two minutes into eating my entree, and the coffee, despite being poured from a server, was lukewarm. (After I asked to freshen up the coffee, there was a server who was attentive to my coffee needs.)\n\nBut both our entrees were lukewarm upon service (acquaintance had even commented on her French toast). My Benedict was ordered poached soft (oddly, the waiter seemed surprised that I was distinguishing the egg firmness), and it came out poached medium-hard. There wasn't enough Hollandaise to help soften the toasted English muffin. Half the potatoes were on their way to getting cold at the immediate outset of eating. Hey, listen, it's hard to talk business when you're crunching on your crispy English muffin, dry/shaved ham, and firm yolk. \n\nI think someone who commented below said they really liked the Eggs Benedict they served up here... I'd like to invite them to Victoria, BC, the Land of the Most Amazing Eggs Benedicts... I had my expectations up because there are two EBs on the menu, and it's not a very large menu. The Hollandaise was just fine, but I would try ordering something else off the menu. (I think I just miss Victoria's Bennies. Sigh.)"

Thought it was a little tacky you had to pay extra for bread/ honey to come with your meat and cheese board, I have never seen this before but it was only 1$ so hey, whatever.. So we added on truffle honey and bread and purchased a bottle of wine all at the same time. \nThe food was fabulous! Cheese was perfect temp. Foie was so yummy. But no bread...we were Sat right next to the kitchens expo so I felt guilty bothering here but had to inquire about bread a few times, 10 min later our server shows up with 4 tiny pieces if bread. I ordered more right away. We had cheese, foie and rillette all requiring bread. 10 minutes later our bread order came, I ordered another right away. \nKeep in mind we never got our bottle of wine. After the 3rd round of bread we cancelled the wine and told the server politely that we paid 15$ in bread and have waited over half an hour for wine and we weren't even able to finish our charcuterie board. She sent a Manager and they offered complimentary apps and we're really nice and apologetic but by that time we were over it. They comped our charcuteriebut our Bill was still about 100$ for the foi, some oysters and a glass of bubbles. \nWe most likely won't return. Any place that charges for bread that takes 10 min to get to your table and wine that takes 30+ min is not my cup of tea."

When I first started coming here, about a year ago, I really wasn't too overly excited about it...but something kept drawing me back and now I'm loud and proud and don't care who knows it.  I love the sharing plates, which are just the perfect size for 2-3 people so that you can sample several items at a time (the meatballs, the lollipop chicken wings, stuffed dates, meat and cheese boards).  And, with the updated menu items like the shaved brussels sprout caesar salad, lobster roll, chicken pot pie, baked honey truffle ricotta (I dream about it, I do) you're ensured happy tastebuds no matter what you choose.  My favorite standby is their cheeseburger, made with pimiento cheese.  I can't stress enough how delicious that burger is.  Also, try happy hour with the mini menu items to get even more for your mouth.  The staff is always friendly and the service pretty efficient, and the atmosphere open and inviting.  Whether you want to go for a drink and a game of shuffle board, or sit in the comfy couches and chat with friends, or sit on the patio and enjoy the Summerlin outdoors, you'll always find that there's a spot depending on your mood.  Oh, and don't forget about Sunday brunch.  It's spot on, with limitless mimosas, amazing baked goods and various sweet and savory offerings guaranteed to please."

They had just enough buffalo sauce on them, the meat was tender and they were easy to eat without the typical chicken wing mess. The popcorn was a great snack layered with Parmesan cheese and just a hint of truffle oil. The mac and cheese was a little on the dry side for me but the noodles were cooked perfectly.

The bartender was very friendly and took very good care of me.  \n\nI ordered the tartare and wings because she recommended them. I also got the pepperoni pizza and parm meatball slider. \n\nVery glad that I ordered the tartare. Very good recommendation. Wasn't sure how pickled veggies would taste in tartare but it was pretty good. I'd order it again. \n\nThe pepperoni pizza had a little bit of a spicy kick to it but nothing I couldn't handle and the crust was very good. Tasted like it had been made in a brick oven. No soggy parts on it even the middle was nice and crispy. I would have liked for it to have a little more cheese on it but nonetheless very tasty. I'll be getting that again. \n\nThe tartare and pizza came out first and I ate it. After finishing the pizza and tartare I Waited about five minutes before the wings got there that I had ordered at the same time. The bartender had to go and check on what was taking them so long. Eventually they got there. I had ordered them because of the bartenders recommendation. She said they were \"falling off the bone,\" but I would say that's a very bad description of them. They weren't falling off the bone by any means. They were tasty though. Paired nicely with the blue cheese dressing. They were 6 one sized bite each of \"wings\". I honestly don't think they were wings but rather maybe thighs. The bone did stick out nicely from the meat making them quite easy to eat. But it took a little bit of effort to tear them apart from the bone. They came with a slice of carrot and celery and some purple thing. I'm thinking it maybe was a purple carrot. They were very good but not falling off the bone and honestly don't know what took it so long to get to my seat. Would have rather had it with the rest of my food. \nAfter finishing the tartare, pizza, and wings I was still feeling a bit hungry. So I ordered the parm meatball slider. But after having the first bite of it I wished I hadn't. The meat in the meatball had NO flavor. I don't even think they added salt to it. I could have gotten packaged meat at the supermarket and rolled it into a ball and that might have had more flavor than this sandwich. Why didn't they add any Italian seasoning to it I'll never know. Honestly the meatball sandwich at subway is a lot better than this sad to say. The fries that came with it were good. Very thin, crispy, and very lightly salted. Maybe even too lightly salted for some people's taste but for me it worked. \n\nI saw that there is a Thursday night wine tasting with appetizers so I'm going to come tomorrow and check that out. Made a reservation for two for that. Maybe try a few more things on hh. \n\nI've lived here a year and a half and have always walked by this restaurant when at Red rock and had never yet tried it til now. Glad I did. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of how long the wings took to get to me and the tasteless meatball slider. I'm willing to overlook that though and give it another try tomorrow night. Hopefully the wine tasting will make up for it.\n\n*******Update *****\n\nWent to the wine tasting on Thursdays. Had a reservation made for the lounge. The night I went there just happened to have a group in the lounge area so they moved the wine tasting to the back of the restaurant near the casino side. I checked in with the lady at the door on the casino side entrance and gave her my email address and she gave me two tickets for each person on the reservation. Each ticket was good for a wine tasting. I would say they poured about 2 ounces worth  in each glass. Not quite a full drink but after two tickets and my free wine with yelp checkin I was feeling good. A waitress and  waiter made rounds to each of the tables in the wine tasting area and allowed us to try different hors d'oeuvres. Some of the things that I sampled were the hummus which had chunks of chickpeas in it, the pepperoni pizza, the tartare, and I think something else too that I forget (thanks wine). They also brought out bread to the table. We were able to order appetizers from the happy hour menu even while being seated at a table. That was really nice. We ordered a couple of the burger sliders, the pigs in a blanket, the lamb pizza, and the pepperoni pizza.  The lamb pizza tasted really meaty. The meat was a little bit overpowering imo. I would have liked less meat and more cheese on it. The burger sliders were just ok and the fries that come with the burger I do like. The pigs in the blanket had a very nice flakey roll for the blanket and the pigs part was mediocre. Would have been nice to have packed that little piggy with some bigger flavors. I had a very fun time there though. Don't know if it was because of the wine, my company, or the overall atmosphere and service but whatever it is I would recommend trying the place out on Thursday nights. Lots of fun."

Over 20-30mins waiting for a server!  I had to bug an acquaintance from high school 8years back to go and grab one for us.  People seated after us, about 4tables, ordering way more apps and entrees and refreshments finished and left before our entrees even arrived.  4 times having to be reassured that our food will come out.  The food was pretty good but not too grand to overlook the incompetence and lack of attention to our table.  The chef sent us complimentary deviled eggs.  Delicious but Idk if I can say it was good enough.  I understand there are complications in the kitchens and mistakes can be made, but they're professionals...\n\nI'd have to come back a different time to go ahead and give it one more try, but my first visit here was one to forget."

It was a pretty busy night.  \n\nWe had a booth shaped like a crescent where we sat with our backs against a wall.  It was comfortable except that it has really hard to talk to each other. The music was really loud and my dad couldn't hear me as we were sitting on opposite ends of the booth. For a holiday with so many families there from out of town, they could have turned down the music.  Nothing like a blasting of the song Sexual Healing to get you in the Christmas spirit! :)\n\nThe food was good. Two of us ordered the price fixe menu and two ordered a la carte.  Our bill was about $200.  The only thing that was bad was the Christmas cookies for the prie fixe dinner.  They were hard as rocks, not good, and didn't seem fresh.  But, we did enjoy the complimentary egg nog served in cute mason jars.\n\nThe service was mediocre.  We got sat 30 min after our reservation.  The servers have a really long intro when you sit down.  It made our eyes glaze over after the first 30 seconds or so.  We also asked for two modifications-no goat cheese under the meatballs and no cookie in the ice cream.  Both were completely ignored.  We didn't complain, but if you have an allergy Id be extra cautious. We also had our 3 week old and they didn't want us to keep her car seat on the stroller base and requested we keep the stroller in the entryway.  It's a small stroller.  Yet the table next two us had two strollers at their table.  Not so much an issue but I was nervous about the stability of their upside down high chairs considering the traffic in the area where they sat us.\n\nDecent place with the potential to be great with some tweaking here and there.  There are so many great options in Vegas...even in the same casino.  Living in the area, I'm not sure it'd be our first choice next time we went out."

A lot of nice selections in surface treatments, lighting, and the like.  Wine list (particularly for a concept with \"Cellar\" in the title) is a joke.  Usurious pricing ( a glass of Jordan mid range cab for $24? Really?), and to add insult to injury - no vintages on over 60% of the wines; so what you actually get at the table is anyone's guess. Don't bother asking the server : she will not know.  The section of the list that actually has complete vintages is labelled for \"cork dorks\". Right.  In terms of the rest of the service; adequate.  Slow-ish, friendly-ish - but nothing to write home about.  Which - contrary to some of the other reviews I've read, about sums up the food.  Some inventive selections, but not super impressed overall.  Low tier prosciutto on the Chef's Plate, Wings with very little depth of flavor, and probably the worst Oysters I've had in quite some time.  (Waitress intro'd them with \"would you like East Coast or West Coast?\"....ummm, might you want to tell me what type they are?).  Am willing to admit that the joke of an approach to the wine list (both wrt price and vintage) may have off-colored my view of the rest - but taken as a whole the concept was eminently forgettable."

            "review": "Three stars is a rating reserved for a place I would return to.\nHearthstone is, unfortunately, not one of those places. \n\nMy mother received a gift certificate for her hard work to come dine at this 'fine' establishment. However, because she works so hard, she has no time to use it and thus this duty fell onto me: her eldest. I was delighted to come with my better half so we could do dinner and a movie. \n\nMovie was great, and we hoped to end dinner on an even higher note to round out our night but it was not to be so. \nEntering the establishment you will see an eclectic collection of items to your right, from white plaster animal heads mounted on this wall to mirrors and signs and photos of varying degrees 'aged' to have that vintage quirkiness that is all the rage these days. \nI think it was supposed to be chic but instead it ended up being a metaphor for the theme of dinner this evening: a menagerie of 'stuff' without any true taste to speak of. \n\nOur waitress seated us, was very kind, bubbly, but all of that seemed to disappear as soon as we presented her the gift certificate - something that would later continue to be confirmed throughout the night as she attended to other tables literally adjacent to us much more feverishly. We brushed it off however as she did continue to at least be attentive enough of our table that she made sure we never ran out of water. (And despite gratuity being included in the certificate we left cash for her on top of that.)\n\nService aside, let's get down to the good stuff (or mediocre in this instance): Food.\nMy other half had the scallops (with cauliflower puree, farro risotto, and lemon)\nI had the pot pie (with rotisserie chicken, roasted vegetables, and truffle veloute) \nWe shared two sides: \n- Sweet potato fries (with a harissa yogurt dip) \n- Mac & Cheese (Brie and Fontina cheese)\n\nI want to start off by saying that it is a sad, sad day when the sides are better than the actual entrees. However, that being said, it was not a meal to remember over all. \nYou know you're at a good place when you are excited to dig in and continue to eagerly dig in consistently through the evening even if you are full, and this was exactly what didn't happen. Once the initial excitement of having food on the table died down it was a steady decline that ended in us picking at our food in rather disheartened manner.\n\nThe mac & cheese despite being initially delicious was far too rich five bites in and is sorely lacking more breading to even out how much cheese and butter and god knows what else it's dripping in -- or perhaps an accompaniment of crostini would help greatly. The fries, as they cooled, began hardening at the centers in a manner that frozen food products do and therein also lost their appeal as the meal sagged on. \n\nMy other half, an avid lover of scallops, told me he liked them but that the entire plate as a whole did not feel worth $36.00, rather, $20.00 and he was even further put off when one of the scallops proved to still be sandy and therein not all too properly cleaned before having been fired. It was then he confirmed he would never order the plate again should we ever return.. if we ever returned. \n\nOur waitress, bless her, misheard me when I had been debating between the fried chicken and pot pie so she had rushed a pot pie order for me. She warned me it would take twenty minutes and I confirmed it would be okay so I patiently waited, hoping for a pot pie that would make any grandmother green with envy for daring to overshadow her family recipe. \nI think instead grandma would have died laughing at it. \nThey definitely rushed it in an attempt to get it to me quickly instead of taking their time and salvaging their already crumbling credibility. \nA lot of the vegetables in the filling were still raw (like the peas), and at one point I found half an onion (I kid you not) still just in it's freshly chopped form sitting in the skillet surprisingly cooked through. There was supposed to be rotisserie chicken in it but I maybe found a tablespoon's worth (and that's being generous), and it tasted like chicken does when you've cooked it, leave it for a few nights, and microwave it too long. A sham and a shame. To top it all off there wasn't a hint of salt or any other sort of seasoning in the filling. My favourite part of the whole thing, and most flavourful at that, was the crust but I'm pretty sure it was just well seasoned phyllo dough.\nThe plate was priced at $27.00, but I think even $15.00 would have been pushing it. \n\nSo, overall, it's a night I'm so glad is forgettable because I don't want to waste a second more remembering it. Maybe someday in the future I'll find the inspiration to try Hearthstone again but anytime within the next year would be too soon for me. Had we been wowed we would have been more than happy to return because if there's one thing we can shell out money for, it's amazing food and a good atmosphere.\nC'est la vie, Hearthstone. C'est la vie"

Our server, Caitlyn arrived almost immediately after and help guide us through the menu and help narrow down some of our choices. She recommended the baked ricotta appetizer which was FANTASTIC, seriously, this was like dipping toast into a pot of gold. My husband got the Hangar Steak which he enjoyed, and I tried the salmon, which was another one of our server's recommendations. I've had a lot of salmon at a lot of different places but this may be the best piece of salmon that I have ever had, it was cooked to perfection and came with an eggplant puree which was the perfect accompaniment to the dish. At the end when the dessert menu was dropped off we were both so full but with the previous courses being so good we decided to suck it up (we're troopers, I know), and try the peanut butter lava cake. And I have no words to describe it, it was fantastic. One of the managers, Sarah even came by the table to make sure that everything was okay which I really appreciated because most restaurants don't do this anymore and it all together was a very enjoyable experience in a very beautiful restaurant.

They asked the hostess for a table at 130pm for eight people, explicitly stating that two in the party were in wheelchairs. My spouse and I arrived minutes in advance of everyone else to find that a high-top was being held instead of standard tables. My spouse told the hostess we needed to change to standard tables due to two being in wheelchairs. It took until after 2pm before we were finally seated.\n\nPOSITIVE/NEGATIVE: We were given food menus but not drink menus. There were a few drink \"specials\" listed in the food menus, one being a bottomless mimosa using Mumm sparkling wine for $24. When I asked about other possible options the server said there was another bottomless mimosa I could order that was only $14 because it used a cheaper sparkling instead of Mumm. So why wasn't the cheaper mimosa listed on the menu? And why wasn't a drink menu offered to the table, with that cheaper mimosa listed? Does management assume since they are located in Summerlin they serve nothing but \"deep pockets\" clientele? No matter, the spouse and I ordered $14 bottomless mimosas.\n\nPOSITIVE: After ordering our food the complementary pastries the staff delivered to the table were lovely.\n\nNEGATIVE: For my brunch I ordered their $21 chicken & waffles, as did one other person at the table. Expecting a rather healthy portion of each, I was sadly mistaken. Later I told my spouse the chicken, as well as the two small round waffles cut into quarters, were overcooked. Also, of the two tiny pieces of chicken given to me, one was filled with gristle. Funny thing is, the other person at the table who had ordered the exact same dish told their spouse the exact same thing I had said, which I discovered later after I spoke with their spouse. This was absolutely one of the worst plates of food I have ever been presented in Las Vegas, and I've now lived in Vegas for over five years. The only reason I did not send it back was because our friends at the table had a limited time to be present, as two had to be on a bus headed to the airport, and we had already lost over 30 minutes with the mistake regarding the table at the very beginning of the brunch.\n\nPOSITIVE: The carafes of bottomless mimosas came continuously.\n\nNEGATIVE: My spouse paid our check, but during the process became distracted by the other guests, so they didn't check the prices carefully. Turns out the $14 bottomless mimosas were charged as $15 each.\n\nConsidering the condition of my food order as well as the overall expense (after tax and tip it was $89+ for the two of us), I doubt we'll ever return here. Well, except perhaps to drink cheap mimosas and eat comp'd pastries."

The pepper sauce added a nice mild flavor. \nThe Meatballs,  3 to an order are made with Braised Short Ribs, goat cheese and placed in a pool of tomato sauce. These were juicy and perfectly paired with the tomato sauce. \nThere are a several choices of Wood Oven Roasted Flatbreads. Really thin crust Pizza cut into 8 slices. The Primavera Flatbread has thin sliced zucchini, cherry tomato's and pesto. The crust was soft with a nice hint of smoke. The tomatoes juicy and tender. 8 slices are enough for 2 people.\nIf the pricing was adjusted I would have awarded 4 stars. Considering the size of the shared plate items the price should be less. The Flatbreads are plenty large but the price is higher than other neighborhood places. \nHearthstone does not have a Happy Hour which in my opinion could provide the means for price adjustment. For now my favorite among the places in Red Rock Resort restaurant row will remain the Yard House."

On the website their endless mimosas were listed at $24 but they were actually only $15 so that was a great start. \nThe restaurant is so cute, the layout very open. It's got a rustic ambiance, I think there were even shuffleboard tables in the back. \nThe waitress was very attentive and kept the carafes of mimosas coming. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros which were very good. I think I would definitely want to come back for dinner because the menu looked really impressive and I love charcuterie."

We had three different people come to the table after saying they were going to be a part of the team helping us. The food came out pretty quickly and again the food was yummy. After we were done we waited about 45 minutes to get our check. Then it took another 15 minutes for them to pick up our payment. Horrible horrible service!!!"

Showed up at happy hour just are luck as this was are first time at the restaurant. Hostess sat us outside patio awesome. The waiter come over with menus we asked for the happy hour menu then he informed us there was no happy hour on the patio. We told him the hostess told us happy hour was patio friendly he checked with the manager (kinda weird) he came back with happy hour menus and said we were good to go. Noticed only certain cocktails were listed for happy hour no problem. Appetizers were half off same as certain cocktails and a couple of red wine selections. Told the waiter other than the cocktails and champagne we would order food from the Happy hour menu. Order jalape\u00f1o hummus was awesome. \nPigs in a blanket also good. Chicken wings also good. Waiter was very polite. Time to go movie starts in 20 min. Asked for the check the girls notice it was a little high. Paid the bill then noticed we were charged full price for appetizers and the red wine. No big deal a honest over site we thought. Well we were SO wrong. Waiter began telling us the red wine he brought her was not on happy hour menu (how would we know)and instead of $6 per glass it was $13 per glass. The red wine he brought (Cabernet) was not on the happy hour menu. The appetizers we ordered from the menu he doubled the orders we had no idea cause the waiter didn't inform us. When we asked him he told us that he would talk with the manager to try and straighten it out. Well 25 min later (now late for the movie now) the manager appears and explains what happened. They partially reduced the check. Waiter not seen again. The waiter new exactly what he was doing \"really\" doubling orders and not informing the customers. 6 appetizers and 5 titos and 2 glasses of champagne and 3 glasses of wine Original check $210.00\n\nCheck reduced by $12 dollars as manager explained she forgot to reduce the 3 glasses of wine from $13 each to $6 each. \nThat some of the appetizers were not from the happy hour menu (again how would we know) Wow super disappointed. As we're are locals and seen many restaurants come and go. Let's check back on this place. As it was Saturday night and maybe a 12 tables in the whole restaurant had customers.  Seemed to be classic bait and switch. \nSo absolutely NOT recommend save the aggravation and explaining to the people that work there how we feel really miss lead, how we couldn't of be any more clear to the waiter."

The hostess asked if we had a reservation and when we said no they quickly said that they were \"fully committed,\" but could put us on a waiting list. We were completely fine with the wait until we started looking around and there were A TON of open tables. After asking about the open tables the girls repeated that they were \"fully committed,\" and we could not be seated at any of the open tables. Disappointed, we decided to go eat at one of the nearby restaurants. Our car was parked in the Red Rock parking lot so we walked back through Hearthstone and (not to our surprise) they STILL had a bunch of tables opened. \n\nKnowing the restaurant business turning away business is always a bad thing to do. I give Hearthstone 2 stars because the decor was right up my alley. Maybe one day I will be lucky enough to get a table and be able to update my review. As for now I would rather stick to my favorite restaurants."

Asked if we could be seated on the patio, and was told we could be seated there right away. Fifteen minutes later we were shown to a table right under two speakers. Ok fine, I'm old and like to converse quietly with my companion, not have to yell at each other. \n\nServer came with menus and asked if she could bring water or mimosas. We opted for water, me assuming we could consider our drink options after perusing the menu. The hostess had mentioned a chicken sandwich served on a biscuit that was a favorite of hers, but I did not see it on the menu. The server came back and I asked about said sandwich. She had no idea what I was talking about. My husband ordered the egg croissant sandwich, only to be told they were out of that. Wouldn't it make sense to mention, as she dropped off the  menus, the items they were out of???\n\nI ordered the nicoise salad. She did not ask if we wanted anything else to drink. After a few minutes I asked for a drinks menu, which she brought. The ladies at the next table were drinking a lovely pink concoction in a champagne glass. I asked what that was and was told it was a watermelon mimosa. \"Ohh, that sounds good\", I said, and was THEN told they were out of that too. Again, why not tell me you don't have an item before I orderr it???\n\nAs a consolation I ordred a glad of rose champagne, which finally arrived nearly at the end of our meal. \n\nOn the upside, the food was fantastic, no issues there. Just felt like the service was weird and awkward. Might go back again, might not."

First off we started with one server and then 29 minutes later had another server. Second round of drinks took three times asking about them and 40 minutes to actually get. Manager did come to table and apologize and took care of those for us. That's fine. Good recovery. Hoped things would get better. They did not. We ordered the roasted potatoes, we asked about them a few times and never got them. Ended up asking them to be removed from our bill. The wrong flat bread was brought to us because our waitress pressed the wrong button. Then the Bronzino we ordered with our entrees to share was also never received because it was never written down when we ordered it. It was a mess. Which is really sad because the food was pretty damn good! Apart from the jalape\u00f1o hummus. This was bland. There was no jalape\u00f1o flavor and needed salt. The wood fire clams were very good, but are served in an amazing broth and no bread to sop it up with. I did ask for bread because it was a very tasty broth. Plus the items are shared so you can't really pass the bowl around to eat with a spoon. We had a lot of other items that were all good. Drinks were very good, however I got the Pimm's 50 first and then the blackberry drink and then another Pimm's 50 which didn't look like the first one I got, so there was some inconsistency there. \n I know this isn't the most eloquent review but I just want Hearthstone to know that the restaurant is beautiful inside. The menu is lovely and the food is very good for the most part. What ruined it for myself and my family was the service and all the mistakes made last night. We didn't even stay to look at or get dessert, and I'm a pastry chef, I love to check out other desserts and menus. We just wanted our of there. Will I go back? Yeah, sure, not anytime soon though. This place needs to get their service in order first. Which is really unfortunate because the food is worth coming back for."

Ordered the artichoke shared plate which was not what we expected. It was 4 hearts with a cilantro sauce. It was tasty don't get me wrong just a little small. Next we ordered to full sized entrees, the Calabrian shrimp pasta and the braised short ribs. Both were awesome tasting but again were small for the price. The only other thing that bothered me just a little was the fact that it felt like we have 5 different waiters serving us. It was pretty hard to figure out who we were tipping at the end of the meal. Overall food was well put together with good complex flavors but service could have been just a bit better with more engaged waitstaff and yes it's inside red rock so expect to pay a premium. These 3 dishes and two drinks a little over 100.00 with tip."

The lollipop chicken wings were drowning in the buffalo wing sauce.  They may have been better if they just served them naked with a sauce on the side.  The mac & cheese was disappointing.  It was more like pasta in cream sauce that they baked.  It sounded really gourmet on paper but then it was just plain pasta with some sauce on it.  Tasteless.  The pancetta on the carbonara pizza was overcooked and the bottom of the pizza was soggy.  The grilled octopus was good but not memorable.  The  Moscow mule was not good (they need to try the one at the Yard House) and my husband sent it back along with the chicken wings.  (Yes, they were that bad!) \n\nOn a positive note, I got a free glass of wine when I checked in on Yelp and Chef Massie made a comeback with the secret dessert.  Three little donuts stuffed with cheese or something with a berry sauce that was perfect - not too sweet!!  I almost didn't order dessert because I just wanted to cut my losses and leave.  So glad we decided to try the dessert.  It was truly delicious!!\n\nThe atmosphere is open, airy & fun.  Loved the layout of the restaurant.  It would be a great restaurant if the food wasn't so bad.  Chef Massie needs to taste his food and rethink his menu.  I don't see this place lasting very long.  I started giving this place one star but changed my mind when I saw the effort that the staff was making and after trying the dessert.  Overall three stars because the service was excellent but the food was one star or less."

My first experience with them was last Thanksgiving as our plans fell through to go visit family, so we were left wandering around looking for where to eat a Thanksgiving meal. We saw that Hearthstone was doing an endless turkey dinner, and my husband and I LOVED it. They really saved Thanksgiving for us. If they do it again this year, and you don't feel like cooking, you have got to try it!\n\nI've been twice for brunch. Their quinoa salad is great, and last time I splurged calories wise and got the egg sandwich. The thick buttery toast is sooooooooo good. My husband usually gets the egg bennies. My bottomless mimosa glass is never left empty, either.\n\nI planned a girls' night at Hearthstone last night, and that finally pushed me to write a review. I swear they must hire the nicest, most adorable people to work here! From the hostess stand to our waiter, everyone is so sweet. And I always feel so super bad for having to itemize receipts on a group dinner, but when I get the $39 halibut and someone else gets a $13 salad, it is what it is. They did it with a smile though, which is sincerely appreciated as I know it blows when you have 5 girls throw down 5 cards with various amounts needing to be charged. \n\nDinner is on the pricey side (depending on what you order), but I got a hearty portion of halibut, so I consider it a girls' night treat. Their brunch is really reasonable and comparable if you want to dip your toes in the water first."

We dined here on Friday excited to go to a new fun restuarant and all parties agreed it was \"ok\" for the price.  Beautiful restuarant, ambiance, but service, food needed much work.  So....here is the reason for my 1 star.  Tonight we took a friend for a birthday dinner, I was the only person in out party that had expierence Hearthstone and I was the one that suggested this restuarant.  The service was incepredibly bad, they were out of the crudit\u00e9s which was on the menu so subbed for \"everything alacart, which totaled $20.00.  The cheese was suppose to be bri and was a mixture of goat cheese and something else and  amounted to a teaspoon of cheese.  We ordered roasted  beets, carpaccio, fries, a ricotta dip that looked and tasted like glue.  I recommended the pasta which took about 40 minutes and actually we thought maybe they forgot about the order.  We requested a glass of wine and after 20 minutes I went to the reception desk and asked for the manager.  I expressed my displeasure  and embarrassment for bringing my friends here, he took the wine off (big deal) but never came over to talk with us about the bad service and believe me; you would think after expressing your displeasure things would get better...they got worse.  Here is a summary of my back to back dining experiences.\n\n1) bad service\n2) very high prices for the quantity/ quality of food \n3) after addressing my concerns with the servers and managers...NO ONE really cared!!!  They all looked at you like a deer in headlights!!!!  Not exaggerating!!!\n4) A manager never came over once and said I'm sorry for your bad expierence, what can we do to make this better....hey at least a BJ's they train the managers to \"act\" like they care!\n5) I called when I got home to discuss this with the manager who never came on the phone which left me no other outlet but to write this review.\n6) I am not looking for anything \"free\". If you are going to charge these prices you better have the quality and service to support your restuarant.\n7) you have just lost 6 people in 3 days that will never return....Im surprised the Fratitas have you on the property....I know they have higher standards than this!"

Really odd mix of furniture and I didn't like having to sit coffee shop style with a coffee table as our table. I was hunched over the whole time trying to eat my food. There seems to be a very common theme to everyone's reviews and that's how horrible the service is. I have to agree, the service is absolutely horrendous. We had this younger girl serving our table with her tits practically hanging out. We had to hunt her down throughout the entire restaurant just to get some refills on waters. The bottomless bellini deal is a sick joke. $24 and they get refilled whenever you can find your waitress and ask for it. If you're not on top of it they will never come back and give you more. The food was the redeeming factor. We ordered a bunch of random things and they were all pretty good. I ordered steak and eggs, they come with pan fried potatoes and onions. While the steak was good, the potatoes were over cooked and hard. My friends ordered the French toast which was good just really really sweet. We also ordered some fries which are these enormous potato wedges that you can literally put back together to form the potato. They were so thick cut that I cut one in half and could pour out the inside and make mashed potatoes. We had to hunt down our waitress for ketchup. We ordered the charcuterie plate and I have to say it was pretty delicious. I asked for the pickled veggies, truffle honey, couple of different hams and cheeses. It does not come with nearly enough bread. We were a table of 7 and she brought us 4 pieces of toast. The Bellini's were pretty craptastic which now makes me think it was probably a good thing she didn't fill them up often. I honestly have no idea why this girl was working as a server. She had absolutely no personality, in fact she was borderline rude. We mentioned several times that we were celebrating my birthday and she never once acknowledged it, no happy birthday, nothing. I don't know that I will ever come back. The truffle honey is to die for but there were too many negative factors. They have so much potential to be excellent but the servers they have are going to run this place into the ground."

The shrimp pasta I loved so much (see previous review) was replaced by a new version with a heavier sauce and much smaller shrimp. A big departure from the old dish. Nothing special about it and I probably wouldn't order it again. The lobster cocktail was tiny and overpriced. \n\nOn the flip side, the grilled octopus was very good. My husband had the lobster roll, which he really enjoyed. Service was also pretty good.\n\nI'm not one to choose quantity over quality, but the value should definitely be there. If you're paying $100 for dinner for two (no alcohol), you should be left feeling satisfied. This wasn't the case for me, unfortunately."

The crackers were fresh from a box oh and the whole mustard seed mustard. It was close to what I ate when I was 5 years old and ate a lunch able except the lunch able was much fresher. The entree we ordered was the pizza which some smart expediter put a fist full of salt on the top of the pizza which, made it near impossible to eat. The sides we ordered were potatoes which were the best thing and the Mac and cheese which was undercooked pasta (not al dente but raw). I was told by many people this place was great!

Never refilled water. We had to ask repeatedly for her to clean up the old dishes.  She brought all drinks in front of me and told me to pass them around which isn't a huge deal if she was cooler but she was pretty much just bossing us around.

After my yelp review I was contacted and comped a meal which I really appreciated. We have since come back and had no issues until today when I talked this restaurant up to our closest friends only to have a waitress who doesn't come to the table, won't stay for more than a second, didn't ask how our food was, and what's going on with every person who works here not knowing anything about the menu? I gave this place a second chance and clearly there is a lack of direction, training, passion or even an ounce of consideration for the customer. You're in Summerlin which is probably on par with the strip on what you expect when you drop $200-$400 on a meal. There shouldn't be any issues when you're paying  $16 for an omelette that comes out bland and boring. I'm embarrassed that we brought them here to this. We won't be coming back off of shear principle. Things need to be fixed or this will be the next restaurant to turnover quickly. With restaurants like Andiron less than a mile a way you can't operate how you are."

They're still working things out. \n\nBut the food! I'm the type that will go to a place based on food alone, not service. I found everything to be carefully crafted and downright delicious. Chef Brian sent out a wide variety of items (listed below):\n\nCharcuterie plate (loved. It came on the cutest pig plate)\n\nFJ&G their version of fois gras, hubby's favorite!\n\n\nRicotta w/ truffle honey; the toast serve with provided the perfect crunchy, chewy texture to go with it. I can't believe I liked it, as I normally don't like ricotta and usually hate truffle. 2-year-old loved it too!\n\nFlatbreads: we got the classic margherita and also the carbonara. Carbonara was outstanding. I wish it had been baked slightly longer. \n\nRotisserie chicken, as expected but perfectly cooked and seasoned. \n\nYogurt: really great!  I only wanted savory items though, so only took a bite. \n\nStuffed dates; my least favorite. I just thought it was overly stuffed with chorizo. \n\nMeatballs; outstanding. I could taste chunks of steak or something. \n\nI'm sure there were two or three more things I'm blanking on, but the food was amazing. Seasoning was perfect and not crazy salty. I liked the smaller portions that the other yelpers complained about, as I could try a lot and share without getting stuffed. Going back tonight to try more things and maybe even dessert!

A friend had introduced us to it before, but the moment our terrific waiter, Jeff, told us it was a special, I told him he need go no further. That would be the opening salvo for dinner, as far as I was concerned. And I was NOT disappointed. The addition of paper-thin slices of red onions added just the right note of spiciness, along with just a touch of salt and fresh ground pepper.\n\nSee there? Just THINKING about that salad got me so damned excited, I didn't go into how we came to have dinner at Hearthstone first!\n\nAs intermittent visitors to Red Rock for different dining experiences, we've had various impressions made...some very good, some less-than, (and yes, I AM looking at you, Libre.) The night we came to Hearthstone, we recognized that it was a place we'd passed by several times and been curious about, but never actually ventured in. This visit made us wonder why we'd waited so long!\n\nJeff was amazing as our server, and made sure that we were well taken care of. As I dove into my watermelon feta salad, (I still DREAM about it), Bear had his favorite, the tomato soup with a salami and brie grilled cheese on the side that was an outrageous-yet-fitting pairing. A single small taste and I swore that I would have it the next time we visited. \n\nNext came the bacon wrapped dates for me, and the chorizo filling and piquillo pepper sauce added just the right notes of spice, heat and savoriness to offset the fruit's sweetness. We divided meatball and pepperoni flatbreads soon after that. I loved the meatball over the pepperoni, because the short rib-based meatballs were especially different...and yummy!\n\nThe main event for me was, hands down, one of the heartiest and best chicken pot pies I have ever had. I'm from the old school, and I remember when the 'best' pot pies as a kid were the Swanson brand, four for a dollar at the grocery store, with crust on the bottom, crust on the top and more on the sides. The buttery, golden, puff pastry top on this, however, told me that my 'childish' tastes were far behind me now, and I could be grateful for that. The steamy, creamy filling, studded with hunks of dark and light chicken meat and roasted veggies were a thing of incredible beauty that deserved to be photographed.  But my taste buds scolded me with \"ain't nobody got time for THAT!\" I surrendered to their whim.\n\nMeanwhile, Bear had the fried chicken platter, but asked for and got mainly breast meat, which was impossibly juicy and tender, the way breast meat usually ISN'T at most places, with a tendency to be dry and overcooked.  With a fresh bacon-cheddar biscuit and all the other accoutrements though, there was so much there that he couldn't finish the platter, and ended up having to box up the remainder.  No problem, of course, because it made a scrumptious lunch for him a day or so later. \n\nThe laid-back, very rustic decor, the excellent service, the unbelievable food.  Hearthstone is definitely on our radar for another visit in the very near future, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great example of \"New American\" cuisine."

            "review": "Hearthstone has taken a page out of the HoneySalt playbook with a look full of rustic and homey elements that make for a cozy dining environment. The transformation of the space formerly occupied by Hachi is remarkable. The space is more inviting with its dark decor, open kitchen, two long bars, a lounge area and patio.\n\nSmall plates dominatef the menu, allowing diners to sample plenty of eats. Several salads are available. The wild arugula ($12) combines some wonderful flavors with citrus poached leeks, toasted hazelnuts, and ricotta, although the leeks were my least favorite element with it's crunchy texture and slight bitterness proving offputting. A much better option was the roasted heirloom beets ($14). Tender chunks of beets sat atop a bed of whipped ricotta with goat cheese and lemon thyme adding some brightness to the dish along with a bit of crunch from the pistachios.\n\nDishes are all beautifully presented, but not always successful. The tuna carpaccio ($14) lacked focus. An overpowering sweetness from avocado and plenty of acidity from tomatoes drowned out the flavor of the fish while the flower petal garnish didn't add anything to the profile of the dish. Thankfully more savory options like the butcher steak tartare ($14) and meatballs ($13) delivered in making the main ingredients the stars with supporting elements that heightened the flavors of each.\n\nFor those that want larger portions, entrees are available as well. The wagyu short rib ($28) is a dish perfect for cooler weather. The hearty, savory, stout braised beef and vegetables is comfort food at its best.\n\nTheir dessert list is full of options I'll have to return to sample. The lone dessert I've tried has been an almond chocolate chip souffle. Restrained sweetness and a silken, warm texture made it perfect for soothing the soul and tastebuds.\n\nHearthstone doesn't forget their younger audience either. A kid's menu is available with plenty of favorites. A pizza is available where kids can add their own toppings at the table and the resulting dish is then brought back to the kitchen to be cooked. Chicken fingers are on the menu, but unfortunately my kid found them to be too hard and underseasoned.\n\nExpect higher prices due to the quality of ingredients and overall superior quality of food as compared with most other Summerlin spots. It may not be for everyone, but the Light Group has created a restaurant unique to this part of town with dishes more commonly associated with the Strip than the 'burbs."

After waiting a few minutes, we decided to ask the very friendly hostess if the others had yet arrived. She said no, but confirmed our reservation for 5 persons at 6pm. So far, so good. We continued to wait in front of the hostess podium. By the time the other 3 persons arrived at 6:10pm, we were ready to enter together. Then, the hostess explained that the table was not yet ready. Not yet ready?? A table for 5 when the restaurant on a Wednesday night is not particularly busy?? Why was it not ready after we announced our early arrival? Obviously, we were waiting for the other 3 people. Did she not notice this? Clueless!\nAfter  another 10, yes TEN, more minutes, she announced that our table needed to be put together or brought from another room or from the basement or some other lame excuse. We waited another 5 or so minutes until the table was finally ready. Wow! No one else entered the restaurant while we were waiting....so what was the holdup? When we finally sat down, we noticed there were many employees. Some were busy, but others were not.\nThe meal took a long time to prepare apparently and all five dishes did not arrive together. Food was at best mediocre. I ordered the salmon that rested on some strange-looking goop that they called eggplant puree. Although not offensive, it didn't taste like eggplant but it looked like spackle with lumps in them. The lumps were garbanzo beans. The portion was not worth the price. Also, they served it in what looked like my dog's water dish. Resting your fork and knife between bites while carrying on a conversation was a challenge. After we ate, no one offered a dessert. Oh well, maybe that would have taken another half hour to prepare.\nExpensive? yes! Worth it? No!"

Then, he menus has mostly steaks as the main meals. I'm saying all this in a positive light because it needs to be explored. I had crab cakes that were cold, wet and very very tart with lemon juice. Served on little toasts. Crab meat was plentiful. The tomato bisque very very good but tepid. I was so hungry and it was so good I didn't send it back. It was like they added the cream last and it cooled it off because corners were warmer. I would order this again! My husband got the meatballs and I ordered the macaroni and cheese. He ate them so fast so apparently it's a winner he said moist but not greasy. I would not get that mac again. The noodles are small and chewy and not of the macaroni size. They used chopped nuts instead of bread crumbs on the top and all it did was throw off the taste and texture. It also was like cheese soup with noodles floating in it. I took it home to see if the flavor would blend better later and I wouldn't order this again. My husband also had the burger and fries and said they tasted great. The service is amazing and the staff is friendly. We want to go back as the oysters were calling my name."

We ordered 2 whole suckling pigs (we had a big group). \n\nHonestly, I was really drunk so my details of this night are not too great, but I will say a few things that I do remember:\n\n1) The service here was not that great.  We had a room reserved, we were spending over $1500 here for dinner, but we had to on at least _4_ occasions go out and look for a waiter to ask the status of something (usually had to do with the drinks).  That's really unacceptable.  If we're dropping that kind of money on a meal, the guests shouldn't have to play hide-and-go-seek with the wait staff. Apparently the bar was \"backed up\", but I have no idea what that means.  At no point should it take 45 min to pour a glass of whiskey. \n\n2) The suckling pig was really good.  If you have a big enough party, splurge on it.  I can't unfortunately give you too much advice on the portion sizes.  I don't remember how much we ate. I do know we had leftovers to take back.  We ordered 2 pigs for about 12 of us I believe. \n\n3) If you're staying on the strip, beware that this is a very long taxi ride over."

We found Hearthstone warm and inviting and can't wait for warmer weather to sit outside and enjoy the patio. We had the deviled eggs first and the pimento cheese center adds to the flavor. Next came the meatballs with an outstanding marinara sauce that I couldn't get enough of. A pepperoni & mozzarella flat bread pizza rounded off the meal then a nice glass of Merlot on the couch was a great way to relax and just take it all in. We'll be back to try the 40oz porterhouse for two."

I laugh at negative reviews from any new restaurants grand opening.  You have to give it time for them to work out their kinks.  \n\nI would return nightly just for their steak tartare.  It is awesome!  In fact, most of their appetizers are really good.  Tuna carpaccio, oysters, seafood platters...  \n\nFor kids, they let them make their own pizza.  Kudos to any restaurant in a casino that acts like they care about the families with kids.\n\nThe ambience is great.  Service is solid.  This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Summerlin."

They are always coming back cleaning up as soon as you finish an appetizer or drink which is very convenient. They are really are quality staff. The only thing I'd warn anyone about this place is that the portions are a bit on the smaller side. I wasn't shocked, seeing that this restaurant is a bit on the pricier side. That's to be expected of a place like this, but all in all, this place rocks. Definitely a great date spot and/or higher end hang for a group of people."

The reason for the two star rating is because at the price points of the food, it should have been much better. My wife and I ordered the calamari and bacon wrapped dates for starters. The dates were only ok. They were stuffed with chorizo but the chorizo didn't really add anything other than filling and texture, there wasn't much flavor to it. The calamari was fine and the dipping sauces were good but other restraints serve equally as appetizing calamari at a lesser price. My wife ordered the scallops and she loved them, so that was a plus. I ordered the fried chicken. Just like the dates, the chicken was less than inspiring. Very little flavor and it was not hot and on the dry side. I felt as if it had been sitting for a while. The slaw was the best part of the dish as I did enjoy that. Again, for the price of the meal, I had higher expectations. There are plenty of soul food places in town where I can get tastier, juicier, and hotter fried chicken for a third of the price. \nI wouldn't say that the place is awful, but in Vegas, there are way too many options to spend the amount of money we did to walk away feeling only ok about your meal."

Lollipop wings were just perfectly spicy with a nice buttery flavor in the batter.  Sauce for the wings cooled them off just a bit.\n\nAbe Froman flat bread was ok, but when you put mozzarella on a pizza you risk the bottom getting soggy.  Needs a crisp crust to make it killer!\n\nMac and cheese was a very nice creamy note and the meatballs (spare ribs) were just a touch of home!  \n\nFinished it up with the olive oil cake to top it off.\n\nService was good with many friendly staff offering to clear or help.  With tapas I would have liked a little more time spread out for the food to arrive, but in our case, it all showed up at once and the table got crowded.\n\nDecor and atmosphere was an 8 out of 10 and would appeal to yuppies, metros, and folks walking in from the casino.\n\nWould come back again without the kids next time.

Thank goodness we made up for it with friendly conversation with ourselves. \nThe portions the five for the sharing plates and flatbreads are enough for one, however for 28 dollars you would think the Waygu Beef short ribs would be bigger than two measly squared pieces. The flavor and texture was good, but when I spend that much I want more than 4 oz of meat. The pasta dish was I'd guess a half cup for 24. Again not worth it. The biggest problem was the way they handle business. They told us they could get us right in on a Saturday night but needed to bus the table. It took 20 minutes to bus the table. After 8 of us were done eating, they finally brought out our entrees (beef and pasta) for those who ordered it; we felt the need to share our discontent with the server who then got the manager. Rather than the manager being cordial he was a straight up pompous douche. He spent 20 minutes giving us excuses as to why they took 3 hours and how it is standard operating procedure. \nDo not go here. Nothing would make me happier than to see something else in its place the next time I am at the Red Rock."

My pan fried bass special was good as were the fresh oysters and smoked meats and cheeses. However, the overly zealous servers and bus staff took every opportunity possible to swoop our unfinished plates away. Incredibly, we almost lost 6 uneaten oysters (at $40/dozen) until I defended ourselves as these precious mollusks were almost lifted away. The pressure to eat fast dominated  the meal. I knew not to put down my fork for fear of losing my entree. Notably, my complaints had absolutely no impact on the uneasy and frenetic pace...almost as if a strict task master was standing in the wings demanding that we get the bums rush in order to quickly turn the table. At the suggestion of our server, we ordered two \"amazing\" deserts to share. We began nibbling when one guest had to leave. We stood up to let her out of our booth and to say goodbye. You guessed it. Before we could sit back down and with our backs turned, our nearly untouched desserts were expertly whisked away. I ended up with an odd sense of emptiness that seemed out of sync with the hefty check ($100/person). In the spirit of full disclosure, the manager did stop by to apologize explaining that the restaurant was only 18 months old and that they were still working out the kinks. We declined her offer to bring us more desserts. I had suffered enough battle fatigue for one meal. Until those \"kinks\" get worked out, I recommend going elsewhere. The two star rating weighs the good food against the challenge to enjoy it."

It was a little strong, but got better as the ice in it melted and watered it down. We just ordered entrees. I split the scallops with my Mom. Our food took a while and they didn't all come at the same time. My Mom and I got our food last. Our waiter was nice though and apologized.\n\nOur entree was a light portion, which is what I wanted. The risotto was more like a cheesy brown rice that I surprisingly liked. It's just that the scallops were undercooked and tasted of iodine for the most part. I also ended up trying my Aunt's meatball pizza and another Aunt's chicken pot pie. The pizza was delicious. The crust was chewy and there was a perfect amount of tomato sauce, cheese and topping. I ate my whole slice. My other Aunt's chicken pot pie was yummy and hearty, but she complained that it was really hot in temperature. She burnt her tongue on the first bite and it took a long time for the whole dish to cool down enough for her to eat it. I also tried a side of mashed potatoes which melted in my mouth. \n\nOf course we had to have their chocolate souffle dessert. It took twenty minutes to make but it was worth the wait. It was an amazing souffle, warm and velvety in the middle with a crunchy crust and it wasn't too sweet or rich so it was a good thing we ordered two. \n\nOverall service was alright and the food was alright.

I have ordered a wide variety of  dishes from the menu, but they seem to have expensive decoys like Fruit compote. I feel like they call it a compote and charge you $6 where if it was just a fruit bowl it would have been $4.\n\nThey have an extensive and yummy wine menu. I like how when I checked in with yelp I got a free glass of wine. I will be back for the alcohol."

But $25 for a small bowl of pasta which is approx 15 noodles and 4 pieces of small shrimp, that leaves you wondering what exactly you are paying for. Well its the ambiance...its a beautiful setup, but like everything else at the red rock, poor execution. The guy standing there making pizza, hasnt even a smile to spare, while he barehandedly tosses the dough and pulls the order receipts then tops pizza. Fingers crossed, he washes his hands thoroughly. I find the menu a bit over zealous for a local eatery or a low key mid scale hotel. And seeing an entire baby pig roasting for viewing pleasure made me want nothing more than to become a vegetarian. Overall once this place has seen most of its locals a time or two, im not sure who they will keep coming back. Perhaps they can succeed on the one time hotel guests alone."

            "review": "So I attended a private function here and afterwards decided to dine. Sadly it was one of the worst experiences. After waiting for 20 minutes for someone to greet the table, I was forced to flag down a busser and ask for my server. After another 10 minutes I had to go to the host stand and ask for someone. No one was there. So I went to the bar and asked the bartender. After another 10 minutes my server finally arrived with no apology for not coming to my table for the past 40 minutes. I should have left then, but wanted to give the food a chance as I glanced around the room and it did look and smell amazing. \n\nI was not let down when I ordered the Butcher Steak Tartare and it was delicious. Very flavorful. So I was optimistic on my entree of the Hanger Steak.  I ordered it to be medium rare. It came out very rare. A cool jelly texture. Normally I can eat a slightly under cooked (or slightly over cooked) meat. I couldn't do that this time. An undercooked Steak is not nearly enough to give a bad review. It happens. I had to send it back. The server was very apologetic. What was bad was when they returned with my Steak. It had clearly been put back on the same plate, but that is not the worst of it. My fork that was on the plate when it went back to the kitchen was returned along with the used plate!  I am sure as the fork had a small piece or parsley from the potato that was on it when it left the table. \n\nI was disgusted and refused to eat it. I asked for the manager who did remove it from my bill. What angers me is although he apologized, it was his complete lack of caring. He said that he was \"sorry I didn't like my Steak.\"  Liking it was not the issue, it was the fact that the same plate and utensils were returned. If this were my home kitchen, it would be different. This is a restaurant kitchen and I have no idea who touched my utensils, where they were placed or what was done to them while my meat was being cooked and put back on the used plate. \n\nRest assured that in addition to this review, a letter is being sent to the restaurant, Red Rock Casino and the Clark County Health Department."

We sat down, and a bus person came and asked if we wanted water, and we said regular water would be fine.  He walked by our table approximately 3 times in 10 mins, and never brought water, finally i stopped him and asked him about our waters, yeah, he forgot.  Nobody came to our table offering a menu, so I went to the hostess and said we had been there 15 mins, and have not even received a menu.  She promptly gave us menus, but nobody explained anything, and she said she would send over the manager.  The manager start walking over to us, but we noticed it was a terrible service manager, Peter from Vintner Grill, who was awful....to the point that after so many years of being regular customers, we stopped going there.  When he saw who we were, he stopped near our table, turned around to look at us and walked away.  He never did come to our table to apologize for the terrible service.  The table behind us got seated, and within a minute, had water, a table server and menus.  Our serve was very nice, and did bring us dessert on the house, even though we told her not to bother.  Its seems that when the other manager was there, from what my friends told me, the place was much better.  I remember when you had to wait at least 1 hour for a table on a Saturday night.  We walked right in, as so did many others after us without a wait, and there were several empty table, and this was approximately 7 pm."

I could tell there was a lot of \"hidden salt\" in the food because I (and everyone else at our table) kept getting refill after refill on our drinks .. I'm still thirsty, now! The Gouda Mac n cheese needed a blend of a sharp cheese to complement the rest of the flavors. The chorizo stuffed dates need a better quality bacon and cooked a little longer for a crispy outer finish. It was soggy .. Gross! The meat and cheese platter didn't excite me either, it didn't provide a wow factor where I could set it apart from other restaurants meat and cheese platters. The service was a bit dusty and could use better training. Many times we had to ask for plates and utensils. The server didn't know the menu very well either which wasn't very helpful as it was our first visit to the restaurant. Aside from all that, the staff was very nice and approachable, the restaurant was set up beautifully and the dessert was UH-MAZE-ING!! It was a Peanut Butter Butterscotch Lava Cake topped with whipped cream, crushed peanuts and a side of banana ice cream. I must say it's probably one of the best desserts I've had , ever! All the textures and flavors were there. The best part is when I cut into the cake and all of the warm caramel-like filling came oozing out. And for the perfect bite you have to get a little bit of everything on your spoon and it's heaven in your mouth!"

I felt young and hip just eating at this Red Rock Casino restaurant. \n\nI made reservations using OpenTable after reading about long wait times from other Yelpers. I made a 7:30PM reservation for two, but I think it might have been unnecessary. Upon arriving 10 minutes early, I informed the hostess I had a reservation. She seemed confused and didn't seem to actually look up reservation requests, but proceeded to seat us right away anyways. It was a Monday night, so that might explain things. \n\nWe were handed at least 4 different menus. Craziness! We already knew what we wanted after looking up the menu online - I was getting the Tomato Bisque and my husband was ordering the rotisserie chicken. \n\nSERVICE: The hostess was an absolute doll. She was super nice and even draped a napkin across my lap! The various staff who filled up our beverages did a decent job. What really killed our experience at Hearthstone, however, was our waitress with some kind of mermaid name - Lorelai. She took FOREVER to take our order and pretty much avoided us the entire time we were there. My husband wanted to order a glass of wine but decided not to because it would take too long. Waitress Fail!  \n\nROTISSERIE CHICKEN ($21): This is a baby-sized rotisserie chicken. My husband said it was good but not enough food. The chicken came with a small salad which he didn't care for. The \"dressing\" didn't taste like anything. Be careful of the teeny red jalapeno slices. I ate half a slither and just about burned my face off.\n\nTOMATO BISQUE ($10): Mimi's Cafe has better tomato soup. Plus, it was lukewarm. The grilled cheese served with the soup had annoyingly super crusty bread. \n\nAMBIANCE: I loved the decor and feel of the restaurant. It's open and spacious, and I think I saw shuffleboard over by the bar/lounge area! \n\nPRICE: I didn't even order an entree and the tab came to just shy of $38, not including tip. They charge $4 for a Pepsi. WTF? To top it off, we were both still hungry upon leaving Hearthstone. I don't get the whole \"You're supposed to share these plates\" concept. For that price, I better be stuffed at my meal's end!\n\nReturn Visit? \nNo thanks, I'll pass. The waitress sucked big time. The food is mediocre, overpriced, and the portions are for infants.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #21\n\n*THIS IS MY 100th REVIEW!!*"

Not a big deal, we enjoyed the bar and our table was ready about a half hour later.  Our server was adorable and bubbly, we love the decor and menu options.  We ordered the seafood platter for $90, it was very fresh, but I felt for the price there should be more.  I'm comparing the Hearthstone platter to smith and wollensky on the strip, which for the same price blows it out of the water! I was a little put off with price to food ratio, but the chef sent out a few complimentary dishes, which I felt made the platter a little more palatable. The steak tartare was to kill for and the pizza was amazing too.  I love the draft beer selection and the shuffle board tables.  Overall, despite the reservations and the over priced seafood platter I will be back.  We actually tried to make reservations for last night, but we're told they were full. I can't be mad because the place is really that good.  We were able to get in at wolfgangs next door at downtown summerlin and we had an equally good experience."

Service was uneven and our waitress simply took our order and seemed disinterested in providing quality customer service.  \n\nAfter reviewing the menu i noticed one thing.....PRICEY.  They have a $21 burger.  All it advertised on the menu was pickle sauce, pimento cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomato. Why the $21 price tag? Wagyu? Truffles?  Prime house made ground beef? I skipped it and went for the Croque Madame.  I ordered a Latte and got a Macchiato (call me a coffee snob but theres an obvious difference) and the wife ordered a coffee which never came.\n\nFood a long time to come out but my dish was delicious.  The baby had pancakes (unfortunately no kids menu was provided). My wife had the Egg sandwich croissant that comes with breakfast potatoes.  It was strange that she requested to substitute the breakfast potatoes for the crispy hash browns on the sides menu (willing to pay an uncharge) she was quickly shut down and told no.  Potato for Potato...anyway she went with a side order of the has browns ($8) which when received (they forgot them when delivered the entrees) were no better than the hash browns you receive at Jack in the box.  They had to be frozen and not house made..disappointing.\n\nAsked for a coke from the busboys..\"let me tell your server\"..its a coke just go get it.  Never charged on the check. \n\nWife asked for coffee again and was delivered...Never charged on the check.\n\nThis place has a lot of potential but service has the too cool for school attitude.  Hope they improve this area of the concept."

The only reason I don't give more stars is because 1.) the seating throughout is not very comfortable, all small scale Danish bentwood loop armed chairs, tight for larger framed persons, even the thin teeny tiny guests looked huge in these chairs. I noticed. I could not imagine wedging myself into one of those chairs or barstools. While the side booths were comfy, thank goodness, they were U-shaped so difficult to hear from end to end with our party of four and the bustling atmosphere. How guests climb into those high barstools then scoot them up at the center sharing tables is beyond me? They cannot be comfortable. The lack of comfortable seating via armless chairs is a huge design flaw in an otherwise hip interior space. It's like flying economy at first class prices. 2.) we shared many plates yet were not provided with any serving utensils, extra clean plates, or plates to put our discarded seafood shells off our main plate. So we had to double dip each using our own used silverware. Good thing we are close friends without colds. The sauces left from the first served sides, like runny oyster water, mixed on the dirty plate and wetted the crust of the later served sides like flat bread pizza, which was not a good thing. I consider this a major oversight in dining propriety & service. 3.) portions were small for the price, and we were not offered bread. My husband made a sandwich when he got home...."

My wife had the roasted chicken which she said was just ok, but the big issue was that there was hair in her side salad.  I had the lobster cocktail which was good, but quite small for the price. My filet was excellent and cooked perfectly for my taste. As we were finishing our meal another server came up for the first time with bread and butter!! I think he was about 40 minutes too late. Don't know if we will return as there are many other restaurants in the area that we have had better overall experiences...plus I do not think that my wife will get over the hair in her salad. My overall rating would be a 4.5 for food and server, but drops to 3 as nobody enjoys a strand of hair in their foods"

            "review": "My boyfriend and I went here for New Year's Eve and we were quite impressed with the food and ambience. We ordered quite a few items, the scallops, hanger steak, meat and cheese board, octopus, and the baked truffle ricotta. We got a couple drinks as well. The scallops were amazing, flavorful and tender. My boyfriend loved the hanger steak. The octopus could have been a little more tender but it was quite tasty. The baked truffle ricotta was delicious especially with the bread. I wasn't too impressed with the meat and cheese board. It had duck, prosciutto, and mortadella. The duck was an acquired taste and we both didn't prefer it. I found it odd that mortadella was served on the board since its such a simple cold cut, nothing special. Prosciutto is common as well. Parmesan cheese slices were included which was just okay. \n\nI will say that I'm impressed that they granted our seating request for a nice booth. The back waiter was kind of in a hurry to wrap our food and kept asking if we were still working on our plates every few minutes so we felt rushed. Server was nice but our waters were never even filled once. Food was great but service was average hence the 4 stars. Be prepared to spend quite a bit here. Our bill almost neared $160 before gratuity."

It took over ten min to be greeted and given menus. Okay no big deal. I couldn't tell who our server was because there were about ten people working our table. Ordered a champagne... It tasted old... The cocktails were okay... Tried a few of my friends... The carrot tequila one (the baby maker) was pretty delicious. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of food to share... We asked them to make the broccoli vegan... Literally brought out steamed broccoli... No seasoning, garlic... Nothing... Okay. So I asked for a side of balsamic, never came. I asked again, and ten min later it showed up, but by then the broccoli was almost gone. We ordered the jalape\u00f1o hummus. I asked for a side of vegetables, told them I would pay. The server wasn't sure if the crispy sesame flat bread was Vegan... So I wanted to play it safer rather than be sorry. He went on to tell me he didn't think the chef would do a side of veggies... SO I had to order fourteen dollar veggies in this ice thing... It came with a green goddess dressing that I couldn't eat because the mayo had egg. Cool. Fourteen dollars for some raw veggies sticking up out of ice so I can eat the hummus. Nice up sell dude. Too bad it sucked and I got suckered. Steps of service guys!! Accommodate your guests without robbing them! The beet salad was really really good. Nice presentation and the only thing I didn't have to modify to death and get up charged on to eat. \n\nOur friends ordered the octopus, said it was okay... And the roasted potatoes... Which were good... And the squash (wasn't vegan) couldn't try it but they said it was okay. They actually forgot to put the squash in and brought out two orders of potatoes on accident. Very accommodating and took both off the bill (props for fixing that one) They ordered the chefs choice meat and cheese board (don't waste your time or your money) it wasn't worth 10 dollars let alone the 20 they spent on it. Four crackers, a few slivers of meat, and a piece of cheese. (Go to honey salt and order it there) Our waters were dry for over twenty min... My friend needed a beer for almost 30 min... By the time they asked, we were ready to go. I promise you I am not even over exaggerating on the time frames right now, it really pissed me off. It was my birthday... Not even a happy birthday from any of the ten people we had working our table.\n\nI love good food, going out, and spending money is never an issue. I was genuinely excited about trying this place. I can honestly say none of us will ever be back. The food I could eat was bland and not flavorful... For the price point... It should of been on point and it just wasn't. I still had a great bday though. And I'm glad to say I could knock this one off our book marks."

The only downside to our table was that it was the first one by the door coming from outside...so every time the door was opened we got a blast of freezing cold air, but it wasn't very busy so it's not like it was a big deal. \n\nOur server was AWESOME. Hopefully you guys get Danielle if you go. She's great. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n-Wine: they have an extensive wine list, I tried a sip and it was good. If you're a fancy wine drinker, I think you'll enjoy the selection.\n-Cocktails: I had the Blackberry Bliss, VERY GOOD. My husband had the Babymaker...I hated it, he LOVED it. He's kinda like an old man trapped in a young man's body, if that helps. \n\n-Truffle popcorn to start.\n   *It's great. Everyone is on the truffle-train right now with adding it into everything they can think of so it's kinda played out...but this was still good. And it's not a tiny serving either, which makes it feel like it's worth the $7-$8(or whatever, I didn't pay attention to the price on it) you're paying for it. The one serving was split between the 4 of us and we didn't finish it, so it's a good size.\n\n-Pepperoni flatbread, the Abe Froman flatbread, Salmon, and the rotisserie potatoes. \n   *Flatbreads were good, but nothing spectacular. The salmon got the job done, wasn't fishy like it can be, and had a great sauce to go with it. The rotisserie potatoes were AMAZING and I recommend them to everyone who can handle jalapenos. \n\n\nI would definitely go again. It's got a super hipster environment, so you're gonna feel like you're not cool enough to eat here at first. It's worth it to stick it out though."

I had about seven plates because I love to eat and enjoyed eating all of them even if there flavor did no appeal to me. The Brie was awesome almost too much flavor. The beef tartar was unreal good and as crazy as this sounds the bread to put it was on point! Stuffed dates were way different than most and made you think. The meatballs were also good and my wife liked them a lot even though the spices did not agree with mostly because there was some Clive in there which I can't stand. The foie peanut butter and jelly was great in concept and execution. Than the dessert we had the peanut butter lava cake. I loved this plate. It was interactive interesting and intensely flavored.\nWill go back here for sure! Hope the quality does not fall off after the opening!"

I know I shouldn't base such a strong opinion on one bad experience, but I am.\n\nI'll start with what I like and repeat myself in saying this restaurant is awesome looking. Very modern and inviting. The spacious dining room and well-lit patio are both excellent places to bring a group of friends for night of hanging out and good conversation. I love what they did with their space, that's for sure.  I'm also really impressed with their beer and wine selection. They have a lot of great beers on tap, which is always a good quality in a restaurant.\n\nGetting one of their beers is the problem.  I don't know if the bar is incredibly slow, or if our sever just hated us, but it took over 15 minutes to get each beer I ordered.  What's worse is I had to flag her down to order it. I swear we saw her maybe 5 times total and she wasn't very nice at all. She seemed annoyed by U.S., which I don't get because we were a pretty modest sized group of people who were quiet in comparison to the rest of the people on the patio. \n\nThe food I tried didn't impress me. I can't judge hearthstone's full range of dinner offerings because I only tried a pizza. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't any better than other brick-oven pizza places in town who sell a similar product for much less money.  The desserts were pretty good though.\n\nMaybe it was an off night for hearthstone, or just that server, I don't know.  I'm sure I'll end up here again sometime with friends and hopefully my experience will be at least acceptable and I can't update this review. We'll see.."

This place was truly the WORST restaurant I've ever been to in my life. The service and SERVER made the experience truly memorable and NOT in a good way. My husband and I sat in the patio area on a Monday night at 9pm. The place was nowhere busy whatsoever. The server didn't even greet us until 15 minutes later. Bad sign already. She came to take our order 10 minutes later with a huge attitude. She refused to even look me in the eye, then when I ordered a glass of Torrentes she snapped at me saying they didn't have it by the glass or even serve it there. I pointed to it on the menu and she rolld her eyes at me then said, \"fine.\"  Another BAD sign. My husband ordered a glass of wine as well and 2 appetizers. We decided to just enjoy ourselves and wait for our wine. Problem was, the vapid server NEVER CAME BACK. Nobody came to check on us or anything. Yet oddly enough, other patio tables that got seated after us were getting impecable service from this minles server and drinks and appetizers. At this point my husband and I had it. Finally a food runner comes over with our grilled artichoke and truffled popcorn. uuumm.... no drinks still!!!! WE ask him what's going on and he looks at us not understanding. He said he had no idea we had drinks and hed go check. 3 other people come back to our table with NO WINE but refill our waters. I felt as if we were on the show, WHAT WOULD YOU DO. Only that show always seems to inform people they are on a show and try to make ammends for their actions. We have had at this point and ask for the manager AGAIN!!!  Surprisingly the elusive server comes by and asks what the problem is. We tell her we how is it possible that our appetizers which took 20 mins to make, came out before our wines? She once again, ever so pleasantly rolls her eys and storms off. My husband gets up to look for a manager. 10 minutes later and 3 MORE servers later a manger finally emerges. WE break down everything that has happened to us and ask her what the server has against us specifially since she only seems to be serving all the other tables but us. The manager says, well she's young. REALLY?! That's the excuse you give for repulsive service and night? There is no excuse for her actions towards us. The manager sent over a couple of items on the house and that seemed to be that with them. Words cannot describe the amateur back alley 3 ring circus of a night we had at this restuarant. We definitely will not be going back to be treated like circus folk again."

We have tried a number of times and every time just to get a table it's so painful.\n\nFirst time we had a reservation at 630 and they didn't sit us until 730 the hostesses were completely indifferent when mentioned. Worse yet when we finally did get in one hour late there are plenty of tables available.\n\nSecond time we tried to make reservation by calling ahead but it went straight to voicemail which indicated leave a message and someone will call you right back one hour later still no call back.  We arrived and mentioned this to the hostesses (both exhibiting a16 year old mentality with no clue) and basically got the \"oh duh\", \"the phone doesn't ring to us\" response. \"Sorry 1 hour wait\".  Wow.  We walked in looking for a bar spot .. Found a manager asked to help us..  Told him the entire situation .. His response was he asked us to sit on a couch for dinner. Thats not dining.  No thanks.  He wasn't even concerned about the experience we just had.  We told him we were going to the competitors. He said okay thank you.\n\nThird attempt more of the same.  We spent some time talking to the hostess about our poor experience.. who said her father was a VP of such and such and that's why she got the job there. She admitted to having no experience and believe me it showed. She admitted they purposely stack reservations just to try and create a hype. Ridiculous.\n\nBottom line if you want to go somewhere where they don't care about you this is your spot considering there are dozens of other great restaurants in the area for both service and food (T Bones, Honey Salt, Echo and Rig, Wolfgang Pucks, Vinter Grill, Flemings, etc), the Light Group should really get their act together here. \n\nWe'd recommend staying away and leave it to the tourist to be forced to eat here with sub par experience."

The food is not the problem, it is the service! The hostesses while young and very pretty are dressed like they are going to a night club and they are not very friendly. Unprofessional. We waited to be sat around 20 minutes although we had a reservation. Once we finally sat down, Tori was our server but I wouldn't call her that. She was very curt, uninterested in going over the menu, and she never came back to our table. A different server brought us our food and drinks,  and another brought us our check...weird. The food was fine but forgettable and really full of salt, I guess that is how they got us to buy so many drinks. The worst part of my experience was audibly hearing the chef yelling and cursing at the line cooks. How unprofessional for your guests and I feel bad for the staff. You can tell nobody cares in this place and I can't say I half blame with the way I witnessed/heard the staff being treated. The management team needs to spend some time on their skills as leaders because yelling the way whoever was yelling at the staff needs to be re-evaluated as an effective leader. I have never experienced this at any restaurant, including fast food, let alone what is supposed to be an upscale/ fine dining experience. Needless to say my business partners felt like crap for suggesting this place and we most definitely will not return. We do suggest Mercadito right next door though!"

We had the PBFJ appetizer - it was light, but the peanuts unfortunately overpowered the fois gras flavor. We also shared the crab cake benedict, which was great. The crab cake didn't have a lot of filler and served as the \"muffin\" on the bottom of a traditional benedict. We topped it off with the French toast, which was a little disappointing. It was way too sweet and didn't taste at all like salted caramel - mostly berries and frosting.

My boyfriend is not a fan of anything citrus or tuna tartar but he seems to really like this one.\n\nCharcuterie board (2 cheese and 2 meats): standard.

But hey had these little tangy sweet peppers the size of a chickpea, that I was obsesseds with. \n\nSteak tartar: by the time we got this we were stuffed, but it was really good.

I Attended a networking event by two of the most  influential people I know, Candy & Charles, they bring anywhere from 50-100 business professionals together. They reserved the lounge area and found that not only did the venue double booked, they gave the lounge away to another group. They had us in their dining area which made it a tight situation. I came hungry because it was my intention to patronize the venue. Our group was ordering meals & drinks while we networked. I was speaking to someone when I get a tap from Sarah Bryner (who I later found out is the GM) in a very abrupt manner, she told me I need to move my drinks from the table because they are moving the table outside, no explanation. Before I can move my drinks, HER bus boy puts his hand on my drinks and proceeds to take it away. I told him to not put his hands on my glass since I was still drinking them.  They also proceeded to move the table outside in grand fashion, with our items still on it, insuring maximum humiliation. When we finally had a conversation with Sarah Bryner, I was shocked to find that she took no responsibility for any operations in her restaurant, including how she behaved towards me, and how she mishandled this whole situation. She didn't book the reservation so it's not her fault it was double booked, she didn't grab my glass so it's not her fault. She didn't bother to really listen to Candy & Charles' concerns , rather, she continued to interrupt them with \"I didn't do that, so I can't apologize for that\".  Needless to say, I left hungry because I didn't get to enjoy the after networking sit down dinner I had planned to have at the restaurant (would you, after such a treatment?) I was starving, so I ended up at Raising Cane's AND guess what? I got better service from a teenager in a T-shirt. What does that say about Hearthstone?"

The dates and the bone marrow were impressive, and the octopus was good too. The service was good despite being very busy and they were very friendly as I hunted them down mid-task to let them know we were around. Thank you Hearthstone for intriguing food and a well trained staff. #Jordan #HearthstoneLV p.s. the PB Lava cake dessert was fantastic"

Tried the meatball appetizer which was $16 for three tiny balls in very average red sauce. We asked for some bread which was nice but we're surprised when the bill came that it cost $8!  Hubby had pasta that was supposed to have short ribs in it but could barely find the meat. I had scallop special on shrimp risotto which was about a \"B\" but for $42 could have had some hint of seasoning. Very average food for $130. Oh yeah, $8 for bottle of beer. Will be surprised if this restaurant survives. Will not return!"

It kind of reminds of Honey Salt which is also in Summerlin.\n\nWhile I think it is on the pricy side I was there for a Christmas party so I didn't have to worry about paying :) \n\nThe service was very good. They came over several times throughout our meal and checked on us and made sure we were enjoying our experience. They also took our picture a couple of times when we asked which was nice of them.\n\nI have to say I enjoyed their appetizers and small bites more than my actual meal. I would love to come back and try more of them because they were hard to choose from because they all looked so good!\n\nWe decided to start off with the hummus, mac and cheese and the dates. I have to say the dates were my favorite out of all three. They were served with red sauce which was a great pairing. The mac and cheese was great for splitting since it was very heavy. The hummus was good but my least favorite.\n\nWe then also decided to order the deviled eggs. OMG they were probably the best denied eggs I have ever have and they looked so pretty when they were served.\n\nIf I came back I would have to order the dates and the eggs again.\n\nI then ordered the tomato basil soup. So good and creamy. It was also served with a tiny grilled cheese sandwich that was great for dipping. \n\nI ordered a pasta dish but I don't recall the name. By that time I was pretty full and probably didn't need to order this. I took it home for my uncle to try. \n\nI did, however, save room for dessert. We tried the Honey Olive Oil Cake and the Milk Chocolate Souffle. The souffle was just ok to me but I really enjoyed the olive oil cake. The olive oil made it very moist. It was served with blood orange sherbet. Which felt kind of odd as a pairing but still tasted good.\n\nI enjoyed the dining experience. I will be back to try more apps and dessert."

They have so many selections on the cheese and charcuterie and still haven't been able to try them all. They have a great wine list, and by great I mean affordable to high end. Now back to the truffle honey... you have to try it!"

The dining room is very large so you don't hear other people's conversations while still being able to enjoy your own.  They also have a PDR (private dining room) at the front of the restaurant if your party requires privacy.  Hearthstone is another venue managed by Clique Hospitality and it shows.  From the start of the meal, you are greeted in a way that is the signature approach imparted by the owner Andy Masi.  Like all things in life, you want to feel comfortable and treated like a VIP and that's what happens at Hearthstone.  One of the best dishes at this venue is incredibly unassuming and ordered every time we dine and that is the Atlantic Salmon.  It's been discussed around the table as the best salmon dish our guests have tasted on multiple occasions.  My go to appetizer is always the lollipop wings (best wings ever) as well as the octopus.  The flatbread pizzas are all delicious (Abe Froman has the best flavor).  Management is always present and professional (touching tables throughout our dining experiences).  The GM, Sarah Bryner, always has a bright smile and is there to accommodate any request to enhance your dining experience.  Whether you are in the mood to listen to some impressive live music (Daniel Park) or enjoy the recurring Thursday Wine events, this is a great local restaurant offering a wide range of items to satisfy almost any mood.  Can't wait to go back as writing this has stirred up a hankering for some of those tasty wings!"

The design and what they did with the space was great. \nThe food was are good with the exception of the polenta and lobster dish. The lobster was cooked beyond the point of return. \nStaff needs more training and is rough but we will be back for the food."

FIRST off I came in with my family visiting from out of town expecting to be treated great with good service and amazing food from the reviews and people I know said it would be nice but I was highly mistaken. The hostess was nice very accommodating but the booth they placed us in was dirty with crumbs all in the tracks  of the seat. It also took 20mins to wait for server to come to even greet the table. The manager was a guy screaming at the chefs and servers very disrespectfully. Once my family noticed this we realized this was a poorly managed facility we decided to leave because of the bad energy. I was very disappointed I wanted to order a bottle wine for the occasion with my family. People who run restaurants should not only value the customers but the people who work for them as well! I will never ever return to a restaurant this unethical."

The table for 2 was big and comfy and our waiter was great and attentive to us .\n\nWe ordered the roasted artichokes for appetizer and was shock to see how small it was for $13. We got two tiny pieces of artichokes and tiny cut potatoes. Not worth it.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the poached salmon and DOC pizza. The salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked. My partner didn't like the pizza very much and nothing special about it."

It's done other places, but done exceptionally well here.  Add avocado, feta, some greens, a mint vinaigrette, and it makes it super delicious.  \n\nI had the petite filet (not my normal selection), and it was superb.  Really well prepared."

Me and my friend came for the AYCE wings and happy hour for Monday Night Football. \n\nLet me tell you this, this place was awesome. The wings came out fast and they tasted great. Our server Kate was outstanding! She made sure our drinks were filled (5 pitchers of PBR throughout the night) and anything we needed she brought to us very quickly (it got real busy that night). Oh and Crystal was great too! Lol\n\nAll in all, I would gladly come back again to either eat/drink, or even to hangout. Lol"
