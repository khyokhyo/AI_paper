Kudos to Johnny and his preparation and presentation of all menu items across the board. Highly recommended to anyone that enjoys a relaxed atmosphere and great service combined with a large selection of menu items that can be enjoyed at your leisure. Pat was our waiter the first time and Jaden took care of us the second time around and both were attentive and expedient in his delivery of everything that we ordered. We will return EVERY time we're in Las Vegas."

            "review": "I tripped onto this place while running an errand on a recent visit to Vegas. Lucky me! It's tucked in the back corner of a shopping center, behind Walgreens, with a cozy sushi bar. I was skeptical at first, when a lot of the baked rolls had cream cheese in them, but I asked the sushi chef what he recommended for something spicy and cooked, and we tried their Heart Attack Roll.... we watched him make it, and I was still doubtful, but once I had it, it was soooo good, with a spicy kick from their jalapeno. Their unagi was delicious, bulgogi lunch combo was great too, and it was really inexpensive, compared to what we'd been used to on the Vegas strip. They're open until 1am, and I kept that in mind in case I wanted to make another trip here before my trip back home.  Definitely will make it a point to stop here to grab a bite again. I only gave it 4 stars because I'm used to a more diverse menu of sushi rolls without cream cheese, but I'm inclined to try it again next time."

Very good customer service. They were so sweet and offered to cancel some of the rolls we had on the way because we we so full! I highly recommend the cucumber wrapped rolls and the samurai roll!

When we confronted them about why they let the other people sit first they just said they only had on table for us even though they clearly had more. Left disappointed"

I've never seen such a wimpy sushi roll that cost 13 in my life. The soft-shell crab that they use are the legs! not even the body. it was far from crunchy. The yellowtail was so cowardly, it made the sushi look worse. it looked like a roll from a GROCERY STORE. horrible presentation. \n- Tempura ice cream was good. They put sprinkles on it. It reminded me of a birthday cake. haha\n- slow service. Never asked for a refill once. Poor explanation of sushi and ice cream. Bad english. After eating at grimaldi's, then coming here, it puts this service to shame. \n- I'd rather lose $25 bucks at the casino than eat here again."

As a youngin I always got the bento plates which are all amazing, great portions and flavor. As an adult I like to switch it up and either get lomein or AYCE, fish is always up if not higher than I expect it to be. The service is amazing and everyone is always on top of it (even the owner who is usually there). The chefs are a lot of fun with tons of energy and occasionally will have a on the house sake bomb! Definitely must check out especially if you're a local, hidden gem!"

The reviews seemed great so we tried it out. We sat down and ordered and the first thing I asked for was a side of yuzu sauce because I do not like/use soy sauce because of health reasons. They told me no that I couldn't have it because it's too expensive.  Too expensive I asked? Ok, so can you charge me for a side of it? They said no, but brought me a very small side of it, enough to dip three pieces of sushi in.  Not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray.  When I asked for more, they all of a sudden ran out.  We then ordered the yuzu yellowtail off the menu and lone behold more yuzu sauce appeared.  All of our sushi rolls came out, with the thinnest pieces of cut sushi I have personally ever had.  They were basically just rice rolls.  This is not what I call sushi. This restaurant should be called Rice Rolls 21 not Sushi 21. We should have just gone with our first Yelp review which was Sushi House Goyemon. They had awesome sushi and great service! Bummed we did not have a good experience."

I trust my fellow yelpers and my friend Shayda had only positive things too say about it. Cool. New tradition take my roommate out for his birthday some AYCE sushi. \n\nI never knew they had great HH prices half off rolls and all you can drink for $10 added charge only if you get the AYCE. Right off the bat talk about making great first impression with the specials. I like dam already have reason too come back again. \n\nTalk about small place not too many booths, the sushi bar has nice amount of seating (two nice widescreens that can watch sports; one got too be close too 50' right on the corner and another smaller widescreen slightly off the side) though, and of all things even have tiny koi pound (more like baby size ones or look like but YES actual fish in it) interesting. More in the back area they have a projection screen type playing music videos and feels little more like asian club cause can hear the music good in the restaurant. Lot of stuff going on comes too the decor for such small place. Honest I kind of fan breaks up the traditional sense of sushi restaurant. \n\nThe sushi ordered mostly nigiri that always given whenever I go AYCE style. I felt like ALL the fish I had was fresh, looked great, and tasted awesome. White Tuna, Hamachi, Albacore, Uni (not fresh; so took it for what is worth OK), scallops not what I expected or say am use too, Salmon, Cajon Albacore, and Unagi. My roommate birthday boy ordered two rolls tried both. Nothing wow factor so not remember what it was. I ordered spicy yellow tail hand roll. It was one of my favorite sushi the whole night. They don't really list hand roll on the menu more cut it up rolls. The sushi chef was great not problem at all. The only thing that feel like lack for five star is diversity comes too the menu. Unlike my only five star comes too sushi goyemon they offer more different cuts of fish, special menu with bunch of grill items, and diversity. \n\nThe service was fabulous! We were constantly being checked up on. Too drinks never even had chance too get half empty before asked if needed refill. The sushi chef was very friendly. Awesome! Nothing worst sitting at sushi bar the sushi chef stay all stuck up. Sushi 21 if want football (MNF style)  no worries about being packed getting your fill in. We sat front and center too the tv the whole game. Winnah! It always helps that not only is it so close too goyemon no worries about it being packed. But it always nice second option if line too long just being down the road. \n\nSushi 21 solid choice comes too AYCE sushi. I will be coming back again get some of that all you can drink in."

When i starve myself so i can have AYCE in the evening I want to eat right away not an hour from the time i get to the establishment. \n\nWith that said Sushi 21 is pretty dang good. The eel was a little too soft for my liking, but everything else was spot on. The sushi chef was great. Even though the bar was full and he was in charge of the to-go orders our food was coming out faster then we can eat, and we eat fast. \n\nThe nigiri was fresh. The yellowtail came in big chunks. So yummy. The Salmon was real fresh too. \n\nThey have an extensive roll menu. LOVED the Jackpot. Nevada was good too. I even got the lobster roll. Its a California Roll with fried bits of lobster on top with eel sauce."

            "review": "I want to start off by saying that this was my favorite sushi location up until last night. I just went a couple of weeks ago and had a great meal. I also told several friends to try this location. \n\nLast night my friend and I were downtown and we were craving the lobster roll. She called Sushi 21 and asked for the hours for all you can eat. The man who answered the phone said that the AYCE was until 2 and the restaurant was open until 3. We got there right before 2. When we came in we were told that we can only order takeout. My friend explained that she had called and was told the restaurant was open until 3. We were not told we could only order take out. The guy said we didn't call and that he's the only one who answered. Once she showed him the outgoing call in her phone, he changed his story. He didn't try to accommodate and wasn't polite about it at all. \n\nWe ended up going up the street to another sushi spot. Sushi 21 lost out on the $70 that we paid for sushi and tip at the other location. More so, I just don't like people who lie so I won't continue to tell other people about Sushi 21.  The food is great which is the only reason I gave two stars. Customer service deserves negative stars. \n\nUpdate: went back on 9/13 because I do like the food. My transaction was pending with my bank then disappeared. On 9/19, Sushi 21 charged me the actual $23 I approved plus an additional $23 duplicate transaction and both cleared the bank. That's one expensive all you can eat. I really wish people would learn how to do their jobs right."

My parents had money so they taught me when you want to eat out make sure you're ready to spend money. I've actually tipped people 50,60 even 75% of my check before. I work in restaurant. I know it can be a struggle sometimes. But with that being said. That means I also know what bad to excellent service is. This server was the worst. She seemed like she hated her life. Then towards the end I asked for the check and a Togo box. She says ok no problem , then proceeds to the food runner and he comes and tells us it's a charge to take the food Togo. That's not my issue. My issue is she didn't tell us and then she had him give us the bill. Had him pick up the bill. And drop my change off. I was highly offended that as my server she couldn't communicate with us. I felt she was scared of me for some reason and I was nice the whole time. But that's the 3rd time in spring valley they make me feel so unwelcomed. (Server / was either Hispanic or white with chubbie face and dark hair. Keep an eye out for her"

We found the \"specialty\" rolls the best. LOVED the Sexy Girl! But be warned...she is spicy. Plain salmon roll was really fresh as well. Lots of great choices!\n\nAll garnished with a GAINT projection of Japanese girl band videos playing on the wall. What a fantastic spectacle that was! I had NO IDEA how much I would love this!\n\nAnd the best part, even though the price is only $26.99/ea for AYCA, you get another 10% off with a Yelp check in!

Sushi 21 was just down Decatur and had a 4 star rating on here so we decided to try it.\n\nThis place is pretty good. The appetizers and rolls with AYCE are amongst the better places in town. The server we had was back very frequently to check on us and the sushi chefs were engaging. One of them even made me a half roll at the end of our meal even though they don't usually allow it when doing AYCE. \n\nThe only complaint that I had is when I ordered my first round of yellowtail, super white tuna, tuna, salmon, and unagi. It came out and looked very fresh but it smelled as if it were treated with something to preserve the fish. There was a slight taste of vinegar or something as well. I couldn't really place it. But the cuts were very generous and once past the \"treated smell / taste\" it had a good taste. I base my sushi experience pretty solely on the freshness / taste of the nigiri / sashimi so they're gonna take a hit on this one.\n\nOverall, a nice substitute for my fave sushi place in town when I was on a tight time schedule. Not a place I'd visit again unless the same circumstances arise with better places close by."

Turned out to be a mistake since Goyeman called us with our table ready the moment we sat down here....but I digress.\n\nThe service is literally the slowest....and I mean SLOWEST....of all time. Yes the waitress was nice, but she barely understood English and forgot half of our order every single time we asked for something. The rolls were not rolled firmly, as one can see by how the roll breaks apart by picking it up with chopsticks. Finally, we ordered sashimi which didn't come until an hour later...to top that off, the tuna was a strange off color. \n\nIf you do come here, however, they have drink specials and the sauces as well as the baked rolls are not too terrible taste wise if you can get over the fact that you might need a spoon to pick it up."

The restaurant was empty (on a Friday night) and we were seated right in front of the sushi bar. I felt like I was on watch the entire time. \n\nMenu items are priced to make AYCE a better deal. The sushi had more rice than fish. They don't have sashimi in their buffet menu and you're expected to eat all your rice. Many of the rolls were fried and/or drenched in sauce, disguising their low quality fish. Presentation was lacking. My maki rolls basically looked like kimbap with fish in it. My server wasn't really knowledgeable of the items and didn't know the answers to my questions. Not a big deal, assuming that he's new. Won't be coming back, given that there's plenty of other sushi restaurants in Vegas."

It was slow when I came in and they had already been sat service was prompt and the nigiri came out quickly as is to be expected of simple dishes. Rolls came out fast and were good the SWAT was my favorite since I'm a shrimp lover. Our friends grabbed single menu items and we both did AYCE which was alright up until our friends had to leave. The server brought everyone's check even though we weren't finished eating which wasn't a big deal at all until our server started not coming to our table. We made eye contact with her multiple times and it still took her about 5 minutes to come by and check on us. She cleared our table as well without asking if we had wanted anything else (hadn't even ordered our last rolls or dessert yet). She ended up coming back after seating a table behind us at which point we were 1 of four tables with two servers in the restaurant. When she asked if we wanted dessert we were relieved and put in our final order. The deep fried Oreo was amazing as was the mango mochi really all the dessert was good (we got 2 of each). \nAll in all good service at first that had a sheer cliff drop off after our friends. Sushi came out quickly but the nigiri was covered in some type of brown vinegar stuff that made it rather \"eh\". Rolls and dessert were great. More attentive service throughout the whole experience would've been nice instead of being placed into the \"I'm getting auto gratuity I don't need good service\" category. 3 star nigiri, 5 star rolls and dessert, 3 star service."

It's just a few miles from the strip on Tropicana. For AYCE, you can pretty much order off the entire menu. Their special rolls were decent, nothing spectacular, still good. I had the salmon and white tuna sushi. It wasn't as fresh as I'd like it to be. Not that it wasn't fresh though. I just prefer it to be slightly colder when I bite into my sushi's. The ahi poke salad appetizer was good. Had a bit of a kick to it. People that enjoy spicy food may like that.\n\nService was decent. Although, our friends told us that the serve indicated we would receive a sake shot with ordering AYCE after 8pm. Well, we did not receive it. When we had asked the server, she said because it was busy they had to move the time to 9pm. Really? With at least 5 tables still empty and still plenty of chairs available for the bar area, that was busy? I don't think a small order of sake would make any difference in how busy a restaurant is. Because of that, they weren't a favorite in my opinion. We asked for separate checks, 3 bills. The bill for 2 people with gratuity included came out to be $72! They added $11 in gratuity. There was only 5 people dining. I always thought gratuity gets added on for a party of 6 or more, something 8 or more. I definitely wasn't pleased about it.\n\nPaid my dues and left. I don't think I'll be making a stop here for sushi if I'm ever in the area."

Great variety of special rolls so it was easy to branch out and try new rolls that I normally wouldn't. Everything we tried today though, was spectacular! \n\nService was very quick and staff was nice and attentive. Made me feel very welcome and refilled our drinks and took our old plates before we could finish saying thanks! Very fast!\n\nAtmosphere in here was great too! Went during lunch so it was relatively quiet, though I'm sure they get very busy during dinner. There was a projection of k-pop music as we enjoyed our rolls. Fun music and inviting atmosphere.\n\n\nWe'll definitely come again! Great food, good prices for AYCE. If you're in the area, and you're hankering for some good sushi, come to Sushi 21!"

My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.\n\nThe service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.\n\nThe last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the \"mini beef platter\", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn't know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn't be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what's inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!\n\nIf. It weren't for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I'd given this whole in the wall a higher rating!"

The good thing about this is that I was able to eat here at Sushi 21.  My favorite sushi chef was here and didn't realize it till I walked in.  They don't have the ALL YOU CAN EAT, thank God!  I think that defeats the purpose of appreciating the taste of sushi.\n\nI had started out with the Edemame and Soft Shell Crab.  An awesome choice as the crab was cooked just perfectly.  The sauce they combine it with is perfect.  The Edemame is good for two people.  One person couldn't eat all that unless they were eating for two.  I only had one roll of sushi called Route 21.  I forgot what was inside it, but I would order it again when I come back.  It didn't even need any wasabi or soy sauce or ginger for that matter.  \n\nService was great especially from the Sushi Chefs.  The ladies are very prompt with the drinks and what ever it is you need.  The food is prepared perfectly.  I am definitely gonna go back here again."

He is absolutely halarious & great entertainment for the night. \n\nHONESTLY would have to say that is pretty much all that is really good about this place in my opinion... only because I am a definately picky sushi eater but you can't expect too much from an AYCE place I guess. \n\nWe always just let Justin prepare anything & we tell him which fishes we don't like. Presentation of the dishes are cute & fun.\n\n Service from the chefs seems to be a LOT quicker than the serving staff though. But it could have also been because maybe they thought the chefs would just do all the work.  One this that did kind of bother me visually was the employees that were eating & drinking at the sushi bar & the just strolling around the resteraunt in their pjs.... but maybe they could have been the owners who knows...\n\nOverall not really a place I would come back too often maybe once in a blue moon kinda place."

A quick search on-line and we found this place a 5 min walk away. The in-house sushi restaurant in The Orleans is overpriced and not very good...How happy we were we found this place and so reasonable too. For those of you staying in The Orleans you are mad not to check this place out. I also commend Sushi 21 for their notice about fish sustainability...Bluefin Tuna will probably be extinct soon and they are actively promoting other varieties and not stocking Bluefin anymore. I'm not sure people really understand how much in peril the ocean fish stocks are. Hopefully Sushi 21 will raise awareness of this serious environmental issue."

Best deal ever!\n\nAs with a typical AYCE sushi place, they make the sushi on demand. They have a huge assortment of rolls, a subset of the traditional nigiri, and some other (mostly Korean) appetizers: bulgogi, ramen, and spicy pork.\n\nPart of this was an ordering error on our part, but most of the rolls ended up tasting the same despite having different sauces. The rice had a strange texture, probably an artifact of mass production. The fish was fresh but medium quality and sliced thinner than a traditional sushi restaurant would slice it.\n\nOn the up side, the servers were very prompt and friendly. They used preprinted sheets to take your order (like a dim sum place). Strangely they ran out of hot water to make tea but were able to heat some more in 10 minutes. Dishes were efficiently whisked away. One of the servers had a hard time understanding us and took plates we wanted to keep and didn't refill our tea when we asked.\n\nAll in all, we would be Grinch-like to complain about the super good deal we got. But if I were paying full price, I might try one of the more established players closer to the heart of Chinatown. So four stars for he Christmas special deal and maybe 3 stars if we were paying full price (as of Dec 2015, their prices were $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner)."

Originally recommended by a friend that also drives off the strip every visit to Vegas this has also become a place I highly recommend to visitors.\n\nComing for Los Angeles my choices for sushi is far and beyond. At $26.95 a person for dinner the price may be a little steep but they offer it back in value that can't be beaten with a few one per person orders like Giant Clam, Uni, sweet shrimp, Fresh Oysters, and a lot more.\n\nThe place features fusion sushi rolls and many creations by the sushi chefs here. Things like Cherry Blossom which features spicy soft shell crab wrapped in avacado are just delicacies to crave and earn the right for another visit!\n\nIf you are a green mussel fan, my wife and i order 5-6 orders of 2 pieces each every time we come lol... And it's sad you'd think you get better food in LA but this place has it done right!\n\nThere is also fusion of Korean delights such as galbi and bugolgi.\n\nThe decor of the place is very izakaya friendly. They even have an area where you purchase and bring your own chopsticks and they will wash them and place it a area dedicated for you to use when you visit.\n\nThose of you that follow me know the amount of sushi I enjoy on a regular basis and this place has made it to my top 3 in value and variety of all time.\n\nI highly recommend the place and encourage you to give a chance."

Fyi our servers were Korean and didn't understand Japanese or what I was trying to order good thing I know a little Korean LOL!!  \n\nMy husband likes uni and mirugai fyi only one order of 2 pieces per person so if you are coming here thinking you can have ayce you will be out of luck.  I don't know what the hype is I didn't feel anything. Plus his uni didn't look buttery fresh.  It actually looked almost brown. \n\nOmg they had instant Korean ramen on the menu...  \n\nIf you know sushi and good quality fish and sushi you will not be happy here. I think this place is for people who think they know what real sushi and Japanese food is or maybe just trying to start to experience it.  Sorry if I am harsh but I have been to be honest and since I have eaten at some really high end places I don't want you to think you are getting that here. \n\nI let my husband pick a AYCE place I think I may need to take back the food decisions lol!!"

The service was not inviting, the fish was dry and looked like it was sitting out all day. The salmon wasn't fresh. It tasted almost rotten. The rice was dry and had a salty after taste. It was so bad that even the dessert was horrible.  The green tea ice cream tasted artificial.  For the all you can eat option, well they made it uncomfortable to order by reminding us that they charge for leftovers.  This is not our first rodeo and we are very aware of that common policy for all u can eat sushi.  I guess im glad he did warn us because the food was appallingly disgusting.  Im not sure I would have finished my orders. Im sticking with Goyemon or Kaya. This place isnt worth the time and money."

As with most \"combo\" style dinners, you get soup, some salad, some California rolls, vegetable tempura, and the entree.  The salad was a small portion of iceberg lettuce with a splash of dressing.  The soup and tempura were average, but the tempura sauce really ruined the tempura.  It wasn't what I'm used to.  Kalbi was dry and really stringy.  Morale of the story: lots of variety with your combo dinner, except none of it was very good."

Seeing as though we were ravenous an hour wasn't going to cut it. This place was the exact opposite of Sushi House Goyemon with only a few patrons. At least I wasn't bored since the guy next to us was apparently a pimp trying to hire the girl he was with to his escort service. It was quite entertaining to hear him talk about his business as though it was a Fortune 500 company. I almost expected him to say, \"we offer all our ho's 401ks too\". Ok this was totally off topic but it was much more interesting than what Sushi 21 tried to offer in terms of food. The iced tea tasted like mop water but seeing as though I was tired and not in the mood to quibble with waitress, I tolerated it. We ordered the gyoza as an appetizer and it was decent but not special. I ordered the #4 Spicy Crabmeat Roll and the #20 Roxy Roll. The Spicy Crabmeat was very underwhelming and I left half of it on the plate. A sushi chef messing up something as simple as a crabmeat roll is like a pastry chef messing up a batch of cookies. The Roxy Roll was the complete opposite however. This delightful roll saves this place from a dubious 2 stars. One of the best speciality rolls I have had anywhere. I would definitely hit this roll up again. Despite the ho hum experience here I would be willing to go back but probably never will. Vegas simply has too many restaurants to visit for anyone to visit a 3 star place more than once."

STAY AWAY!  The quality is absolutely horrible. \nSomething that stood out was the uni.  This was THE worst sea urchin I have encountered in my life. It was faaaaar from fresh, and the consistency was disgusting.  I have eaten fresh uni in Tsukiji fish market in Japan, right out of the sea urchin, still moving... So I know exactly how fresh and good uni should taste.  I dont know what I was thinking expecting it from this restaurant.\n\nIt is Korean owned, and not authentic Japanese sushi.  The sushi \"chefs\" did not know the proper way to prepare the dishes or what sauces go with which.  They are also not very good at preparing sauces, as we had a roll that came out tasting exactly like a sour lemon... Ummm yikes!  Please wait the extra 20 minutes and go to Goyemon.

Anyways ! The all you can eat sushi is like $26 a person and we were kinda iffy on it but then we took that gamble and the food quality was not as good as I hoped ): we were supposed to go to goyemon but the wait was literally an hour so we decided to go to sushi 21 since it was near by . We walked in and the restaurant was basically empty and so we sit and the waitress took our order . They forgot my baked mussels a couple of times that I asked and did I mention the quality of the food wasn't that good ? Idk it might be just me coming from Hawaii (with some of the freshest yummiest fish) to Vegas with some crappy not as fresh  quality fish but yeah the mussels tasted like over cooked really hard chewy mussles with some really bold sauce to cover it up . And the miso soup was SOO salty omg my mother couldn't even finish it because she said it was waaaay too salty for her . But the spicy poki was actually kinda good only cuz it was really spicy but to also add the fish was still extra chewy bleh . We also ordered a yum yum roll and that was pretty bland not as \"yum yum\" as I expected . The wonton soup though is good I'd recommend but the portion is SOO little you'll probably finish it in a couple of bites . Overall I wish I dined at goyemon tonight instead but it's always good to try new places and I can't say it was completely disgusting since it did fill me up so 2 stars because the customer service wasn't terrible but only 2 stars because $26 for a person for such low quality food is not agreeable to my standards"

When I came in to pick it up she was apologetic and thought she was so sweet. I'm sure she gets a bunch of douchebags who give her a hard time but I assured her everything was okay.

I usually round up but here I'm rounding down for the dishonesty of their check-in scam.\n\nWe were craving sushi around 1am and this was the only AYCE we saw that was open past 2am.\n\nService was friendly and not inattentive though that may have had to do with the fact that we were the only ones there at 1am (despite their supposedly closing at 3am).\n\nLast call is posted in the window as 2:15 but when we sat down we were informed last call was at 1:45am. Did not contest the sign on the door. Maybe they changed their hours, but if that is the case then they needed to also change their signs.\n\nThe sushi rice was too sweet.\n\nFish across the board was not very fresh.\n\nUni was not great. The brighter the color, the better. Pale or brown uni has either a plasticky or seaweedy (and not in a good way) taste to it. These were pretty brown, but surprisingly not as awful as at JJANGA or Goyemon.\n\nOysters were far from the worst I'd ever had, but the freshness of a raw seafood item is still worryingly called into question when you feel the need to put lemon slices directly on it.\n\nSnow crab was so cloyingly sweet it was sweeter than the shaved ice we had at Chada St on Tuesday. It did not taste like crab at all, real *or* fake.\n\nWe asked for no sauce on anything but they only remembered to not put sauce on our shrimp tempura roll, which had surprise \"krab\" (fake crab) in it.\n\nWhich brings me to the rolls. Rolls on the special, baked, and fried rolls lists (basically everything that was not on the traditional roll list) were not very varied. Almost everything had fake crab in it even if it was not a listed ingredient. Everything that didn't have krab had spicy tuna and everything that didn't have spicy tuna had krab.\n\nWe ended up only getting a couple rolls because after they couldn't get \"no sauce\"\" right we were not confident they would be able to do \"no crab\" reliably and did not want to fill our stomachs with that sweet crud.\n\nDisappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could still have green tea ice cream and still have tempura and not have tempura green tea ice cream (I had horrific thoughts of soggy, pre-tempura'd ice cream dancing rudely in my head, but the DH informed me that they have to super-freeze a ball of ice cream in order to tempura it without it melting, and that this takes 2 hours or more, so apparently that's how).\n\nDon't like the scam they're running for the check-in discount. Have encountered the whole \"write good review for a discount\" scam before, but never seen it attached to a check-in, or seen a place where they want the review up front. Makes no sense."

Service were terrible! Prices are terrible!!!\n\nDon't go!!\n\nThere was seven of us that night. My friends was there first and told them that we wanted AYCE. I arrived 10 minutes later. We told them again. another 10 minutes later, we had to tell them one more times that we want AYCE. Finally 20 minutes later, this girl took the regular menu away and threw this paper to us and said \"just check mark next to the items we want\". \n\nOk, I guess it's self service.\n\nWe decided not to order too much sushi and everything we order was going to be 7 orders for each one of us. We gotten each order of sushi every 5 minutes. (You have to understand that one order of sushi is two bites, two bites every 5 minutes is annoying) \n\nHalf way through our orders, this rude younger girl came around again and asked us if we wanted anything else. We told her that we never got the rest of first round. She told us \"just wait\" and \"it's coming\". Ok....so we ordered a little more.\n\n10 minutes later, we got all of the second round(salmom, yellowtail, and eel for the second time), but still........ half of the first round was not here. \n\nMost of the first round items are the expensive items. Spider hand roll, sea urchin(uni), sweet shrimp , makerel (saba) and snow crab. \n\n10 minutes went by again, no first round. We asked and got the same answer. Then we decided to order shrimp tempura. And we got \"fried shrimp\". Very disappointing. The \"fried shrimp\" was breaded with PANKO. This is just unbelievable.\n\nAfter the shrimp disaster, we asked again about our first order. The rude girl finally tried to ask us what they were. By this time, it's almost one hour since we arrived. The kicker of the night is she elected to tell us that she is worried that we won't be able to finish and they are only going to give us the first round orders one at a time.\n\nThis is just MADNESS.\n\nAt the end, of course we did not get all of the food we want. We were too angry to deal with them, and we did not want them to spoil the night even futher. \n\nOf course they charged us mandatory 18% tip on the check after the sales tax. \n\nOf course the hot tea we have to beg for was not included. \n\nAnd of course nobody said \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\" to us after we just spent almost $40 a person for the wrost sushi ever."

The service is professional and well planned.  And the prices, with AYCE, are very decent.  The atmosphere was lively for a weeknight.\n\nThe popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time.  It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness.  I think this is something that this bar can call its own - that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar.  And I think that says a fair amount. \n\nAlso, the fish was fresh and that is very, very important when you're looking to consume raw.  Good location and its definitely worth the walk in if you're in the mood for sushi."

Err..well sometimes they forget but I'm not really gonna freak out about it, it's FREE. The table service is pretty inconsistent though. I have had AMAZING service (and make sure to let them know with a tip they did well) and then I've had some pretty awful service as well (sitting on an empty drink for 20 minutes, stacks of empty plates waiting to be taken away. I've even seen the chefs having to remind the waitresses to get the food and bring it to the table.) Soo....I gotta knock a star off for that. But I gotta say...as a loyal customer these guys treat us great. From random, \"Just try this, don't eat it if you don't like it\" rolls, to great recommendations on the AYCE menu. Never had a bad experience with the freshness or quality of the food sooo...not sure what some of the other reviews are talking about. :-\\\n\nAdvice? Be good to the chefs.

I cannot speak bad about Makino seeing as that was the 1st place my best friend took me to that got me started enjoying it.  I will never go back because raw fish sitting out cannot be healthy!  Having said that, some people question these AYCE Sushi joints for the same thing, and I have seen some things that were not good. But I see things wrapped that aren't being used, food kept at excellent temperatures, and nothing is ever left out!  I have walked out of another place and left my stamp card behind to tell them I would NOT be returning. As a cabbie who actually cares about my riders,  and who happens to be a \"non-Strip\" food fanatic,  and who happens to be rather large,  I like taking guests to food havens and looking at the faces of full and happy customers.  21 does it very well. The fact that it's not in Chinatown makes it an easier drive (J/K). You can also have sashimi   at dinner.  BTW if you need a driver that 1. Speaks English 2. Is 100% Honest 100% of the time.  3. Has a personality and is funny.  4. Knows a lot about this crazy town (history and food. I may not know ALL the clubs because they change almost weekly ) 5. My #1 concern is the safety of my customers.  Both on the road and in situations where people get ripped off.  Vegas is a fun place but some people target good people who may make drunken choices.  Let me help you stay safe."

I was told that's all the uni they have. ???? Its a prime time for dinner and they don't have anymore uni???  I ended up sending it back. Very disappointed. I suppose its the sushi chef refused to change to fresher uni because wait staff was very nice. Having good customer service is just as important as having good foods. When I have bad customer service even good foods taste bad. \nThey charge for small white rice $1.75 and. Green tea is $1.50. Not included with all you can eat. Fish wasn't that fresh either.

If you want Japanese chef go to Japan where you might be surprised that not every sea urchin is fresh either.  One reviewer was taken by the sea urchin taste: when you are in the desert, what do you expect, a mini ocean in the back yard?\n\nQuality: fresh and what it should be. However they do not put wasabi right away in nigiri. Rice was warm and not hard, in a perfect proportion to the amount of fish.\n\nAtmosphere: it is not  a fancy restaurant but a pleasant one.

I think the higher star ratings were so that people could take advantage of the check in deal, 10% off the bill if you show them your review on Yelp. Seems a bit fishy (haha) if you ask me. \n\nThe reason why I came here was because I was craving a bento box. I chose the teriyaki chicken box and added a Japanese lasagna roll. The roll came out first, and it was meh. Japanese lasagna is my go-to roll at any sushi place. Many places fail to make it to my liking, this happened to be one of those places. Oh, before I go on, I ordered the iced green tea which sounded delicious and refreshing, but it tasted like fishy rice! Seriously, it tasted like a sushi roll. I thought I was trippin, but after a few sips I had to give it back. I quickly exchanged it for water and they told me they would take it off my tab which was nice. By the way my server was very nice and checked on me often, so I have no complaints about the service.\n\nAnyway the bento box is huge and you won't leave hungry. It comes with your entree (teriyaki chicken) with veggies, rice, 4 pieces of a California roll, salad, and veggie tempura. Everything was just okay, I didn't care for the dressing on the salad, and I didn't care for the teriyaki sauce that came with the chicken. I like the tempura veggies, zucchini and sweet potato, yum! And the Cali roll was pretty good also. I just don't see myself running back here anytime soon."

However, they didn't have oysters which was a real bummer since it was on the menu and something we expected to slurp on.  Lindsey was our server and I must say the service was excellent.

I think they must've felt bad because after I got their attention, it was relatively smooth.\n\nDespite the service, I would be okay with the place if their food was something to write home about. This isn't the case. Fresh oysters were served at room temp; literally almost every piece of nigiri sushi was on top of a piece of lemon; the rice either had too much sushi su or something like yuzu. Almost seemed like they were hiding bad fish quality.  Even the cooked foods like the mini beef steak was off somehow. Best I can describe it the meat had a strange consistency with a slightly sour taste.\n\nTo top off this great dining experience, half the kitchen staff blanketed the entrance with cigarette smoke when we left.

Sashimi portions were generous and very tasty. I had mackeral, octopus and salmon. All were excellent. Best of all was their iced green tea. They use gunpowder green tea which is very flavorful and not cheap tea leaves.\nI spent $102 for lunch for two people which obviously isn't cheap but I'm expensing it on the company so I didn't really care about price!\nThe cost is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars as it's not a great value.

The towels they gave us were dirty and I wish they gave us napkins instead. The counter tops smelled liked dirty rags and we're extremely sticky, made me feel like the place was a bit unsanitary. While I was eating, there was a spider crawling around my table and freaked me out, making me lose my appetite. For appetizer, the Miso Soup is not too bad and the Golden Spoon is an interesting dish to try, but the Garden Salad was so tasteless and the greens weren't fresh. The raw sushi was decent in quality and freshness, my only critique is that the fish on nigiri was sliced too thin so it didn't satisfy me. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) was actual really big in size compared to other restaurants and they at least serve Giant Clam, which many sushi restaurants having been serving lately. The Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) Nigiri was not made well, it was extremely cold when it's supposed to be warm, it was drenched in eel sauce, and there was a lot of rice. There were three people doing sushi at the bar and the sushi that came from the main chef was more impressive than the sushi made by the other two chefs who looked like young teenagers. At the end of my meal, I got to have Mochi Ice Cream which at least didn't disappoint me and actually satisfied my taste buds. I was not impressed by this restaurant, it was not worth the $26.99 for AYCE. The restaurant looks nice but the quality of food didn't live up to the name."

            "review": "This place was AMAZING! It may even be a new favourite for me in terms of AYCE on the West Side (I live in Green Valley area) because the quality is phenomenal without overdoing it on the rice side.\n\nI always started out with seaweed salad and edamame. The salad was on the small side in terms of portion, but very sweet and delectable flavour so it did compensate. It leaves room for much more anyway! The edamame came out steaming which is great because nothing is worse than cold edamame as it tends to drop in temperature rapidly anyway.\n\nTheir menu has very unique items compared to most AYCE places. I tried the Screaming O Salad, which was three pieces of seared tuna with the sauce slathered over cabbage and lettuce. At first I expected it to taste bland due to the lack of colour but it was actually a very similar sauce compared to Ohjah's, which is a more expensive a la carte bistro in Summerlin- my only point of reference really. This was very close, and quite enjoyable for trying something new.\n\nTheir nigiri was just as comparable in quality to my favourite Henderson spot Sushiwa. The fish itself was a little smaller but at least not coupled with a snowball of rice and leaving you to order more. The salmon and tuna were both moist with flavour and I enjoyed the Pepper-Seared and Super White- both hit me with that va va voom melting effect.\n\nBUT if you want melting- then you WANT to ordered their baked rolls. I suggest a half-roll so that you don't have to be wheeled out of the joint, and it works if you're sharing so that you can try more. The two rolls that blew my mind were the Baked Salmon and Baked Lobster. Absolutely delectable, especially Lobster for me. \n\nAt this point, if you're still open to another order before getting dessert, I suggest another half-roll of something fresh like Philadelphia per my friend's suggestion or perhaps another simple roll. \n\nDespite bikini season approaching quite quickly, I knew I needed to experience their Deep-Fried Oreo. It was the first I'd seen in the desserts section of an AYCE before and it came out with a beautiful dollop of whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles, and deep fried chocolate. My waistline was happy it was only the size of 2 oreo cookies but my stomach was a little sad not to have more because the rich chocolate complemented the entire meal. Don't expect it to be creamy like the cookie though, and it's no complaint from me because I have a slight allergic reaction to anything too thick or frosty hitting my throat (no innuendo pun intended).\n\nWILL DEFINITELY BE HERE AGAIN! :)"

So we drive all the way over there only to be told 1) I didn't really call there (the rude guy at door even made me show him my phone that I called there) and 2) they only serve take out. It was 138am. Guy was so damn rude, they have lost a few customers in me and my friends. I'll never be back. Don't say one thing and do differently when you have customers.

They were out of a few of the drinks that I wanted to try so I had to \"settle\" for a bottle of soju.  The waiter, a little astonished by the severity of my alcohol tolerence, i guess, made hand gestures to demonstrate the size of the bottle.  Having played this game before, I quickly smiled and blushed like an anime character and threw up the thumbs up sign, with both hands. The waiter quickly understood and I thought that I heard him proudly tell another waiter as he walked away, \" Errr, ohh thats a Meesta Amerika, Meesta Uuu Ess Aye!\" But that might have been the soju talking or maybe racism.  \nAnyway, the nigiri, which is always my favorite was acceptable.  It came out fast and I did not have to wait.  I had almost everything and all seemed reasonably fresh.  I had to order the AYCE dinner to get the uni, and as always in vegas it is never orange; it's always a little on the brown side, but it was delicious.\nWhat really gives this place four stars, at least for me, was the amount of made up quasi japanese fusion shit that is on their menu.  I had a japanese burrito.  It is basically like a california roll wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried.  I also had a monkey ball, which was like pork and california roll ingredients, breaded, sauced and deep fried.  It was weirdly awesome.\nReally, the little things on their menu, like crawfish, golden spoon, dynamite, the above and all the other things makes their AYCE well worth it.  I tried sooooo many things and was quite pleased by the end of the meal.\n\n\nOh Wait!!!\nTempura Oreo!!!!!! \nYeah, I did it, the only down fall was the canned whip cream that accompanied it.  But still, I had a deep fried oreo.  Was it all that tasty?  Any tastier than a non deep fried oreo?  Not really.  But sometimes it's just about the absurdity of the decadence.\nKanpai"

The only part that I would like to see a change in is that they should start serving half rolls. That gives a much better experience to the \"all you can eaters\" and that it's a big deal for me.

DO NOT make that mistake by skipping the apps here!  The Dynamite appetizer is a soupy taste of the sea you just have to try.  Little bits of sea creatures in an onion, corn and mushroom soup make this funky bowl of sea goodness something you gotta try.  Second on the \"gotta do\" is the \"cherry blossom\" app: spring mix salad with a ball of avocado slices stuffed with spicy soft shell crab) and a sweet eel sauce.  It's an extremely good way to start the meal.  Oh, and I'll let you experience the \"Screaming Orgasm\" appetizer for yourself (trust me, you'll thank me for allowing you to do so).\n\nRolls you gotta do: popcorn lobster, fire fire and kiss of fire (I like hot and spicy, and the hottest on the menu is the \"fire fire\").  But look, you really can't go wrong with anything here. From the \"plain\" to the special stuff, it all tastes great!\n\nI ate til I almost exploded. Add in the AYCD(rink) option and you're in for quite the night. \n\nLas Vegas is no exception to the rule that the best food is found in places you're willing to seek out."

I've gone here a few times for lunch, and for to go. \n\nThe inside is kind of pop-Japanese style with traditional elements mixed with LCD screens playing Japanese boy-band videos the whole time. A cool distraction. I've mostly eaten here in the middle of the day, as opposed to the evening. \n\nNone of the rolls really stand out in my mind, service is a little bit slow some night. The AYCE has a good sized menu, and some tasty standard treats, but for the price I have been to other places with Free Saki & Beer for almost the same price. \n\nWhenever I go for lunch I like the Bento Box the best. It's got a little bit of everything on it, Gyoza, Rice, Teriyaki Chicken, a Salad, Miso soup and 6 pcs of california rolls. Not bad.   I also enjoy the Shirmp Tempura and Calamari at this location. \n\nI've never had a bad experience at Sushi 21 like some of the other reviewers, but it has a long way to go to beat out other AYCE's scattered around Las Vegas."

This place was easy to get to and had plenty of parking. A serious plus in our book!\nWe were seated and immediately brought our drinks. The waiter took around 10 minutes to make it around to our table but my food came out within 5 minutes of ordering!! So quick!\n\nI ordered the gyoza which came with a delicious dipping sauce. I wasn't hungry enough for the AYCE menu so I just got one roll. I chose the yum yum roll which was delicious! Super light and fresh. I ate the whole roll and appetizer and felt very satisfied. \n\nMy husband however was starving and chose the all you can eat option which was very reasonably priced at $26.95. (Each roll averages to about $11 dollars so this option made sense) \nHis order took a little longer to make, I had finished my whole meal before he got his. It would have been nice to maybe have at least one roll of his brought out with mine. \nHe chose the TNT, caterpillar, and the vegas lasagna roll. \n\nThe service was great overall, our waiter was attentive and checked back to let my husband know his rolls would be out soon. Sure enough they were brought within 3 minutes.  \n\nThe atmosphere is laid back and casual. We appreciated this after a long day of driving. \n\nThe price point was good; the AYCE made up for the lack of the \"half price sushi\" option. The restaurant was pretty spacious so it wasn't too loud. LOTS of booths. \n\nAll in all it was a perfect stop on our way through the city. Will definitely recommend and return!"

We were seated immediately, and got our drinks in a timely manner. Receiving our soup within 10 minutes and then our main course in 1 hour! Though upon receiving our meal it was over seasoned meat which is just too powering. The Sushi was adequate, and the calamari was appalling. Never have we ever been served sushi where an ant crawled out. After that my appetite was almost gone, but I had not eaten the whole day so I still went to eat my main course. Next the calamari looked like onion rings, and the taste and texture was the most bizarre feel and taste of calamari I had ever experienced; as it was extremely stretchy sort of like trying to eat gum. Arriving at 8:01 and recieving our food at 9:30 it was the longest i have ever had to wait for food in my whole entire life! I hope they acknowledge this and address this issue. As for now I wont be coming back, and will not be recommending to anyone to the disgusting sushi, rubbery calamari, and extremely slow kitchen service!"

We had to ask for refills and when the last of our party came and sat with us for 20 min, we still have to ask for a place setting.  \n\nI do have to say popcorn lobster and seared salmon was the highlight of our meal.  majority of the rolls were stuffed with crabmeat as filler.

We had to say excuse me several times to order food (despite the 7 total seated tables) but at the end of the meal they became attentive. Oh and we ordered a few things that never came out but I'm thankful for the mistake since the nigiri pieces are thin, the rolls are drenched in one sauce or another so the rice is soggy and most of the hot food was over cooked (popcorn lobster & baked aka crispy mussels).  \n\nAs pictured I'd recommend that no presentation that includes fish should have any green sauce.

We drove by Goyemon but it looked too busy so we drove back to this spot.\n\nHunnie Bunnie got her Edamame and Japanese Udon Noodles which she enjoyed.\nThis is what I ordered:\n\nBaked Green Mussels - these were really good, whatever sauce/toppings they put on I really liked and they were served nice and warm.\n\nCalamari rings - crispy breading and served with a spicy dipping sauce. Not bad at all.\n\nSoft Shell Crab - small soft shell crab, split right in half. Good stuff. I love sscrab!\n\nLettuce Wraps - they were out of this item!!! I really wanted to try these cuz it involved pork belly :-( Next time!!\n\nTuna Poki Salad - this was aiight. I've definitely had better. It's some kind of different sauce they put on and I think the spiciness of the sauce overwhelms the flava\n\nScreaming Orgasm - not enough sashimi but lots of daikon\n\nYellowtail Jalapeno - they put sriracha on the jalapenos. I usually LOVE sriracha but i didnt care for it on this dish. And i wasnt really a fan of the sauce they used for this sashimi plate.\n\nTuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna Nigiri - SO good! This fish tates SOOO fresh and melt in your mouth! Nicr size cut of fish and a small serving of rice accompanies it. REALLY REALLY GOOD! I had given up on AUCE sushi because the fish just didnt taste that good to me anymore but this place changed my mind! \n\nScallop: It's mixed with something, crab mix maybe, and not tasty at all.\n\nSweet Shrimp - I actually only ordered this so I could eat the fried shrimp heads. Nom. And to think I never ate them before... The shrimp itself wasnt very good but the heads were tasty!\n\nFour stars for the fish. Three stars for the apps."

            "review": "I wanted to wait till I got home and in front of a computer to write this review. We've eaten at many sushi restaurants in Reno and other cities BUT, we have never eaten at a sushi house this good. \nYes, you do get 10% off if you write a Yelp review but, they didn't check to make sure we wrote a review. It must be a service Yelp offers or the pop up coupon you get when you check in on Yelp wouldn't work. That's fine anyway, Yelp is one of the best ways to advertise and I would write a review one way or another.  \nThere are instructions on the AYCE menu so pay attention. There are certain items on the menu you can only order one of per person, but I own a bookkeeping service and can tell you restaurants run on a pretty slim margin. You can't blame them for not wanting waste. Also, if you do not eat all of your meal you will be charged regular price for that roll. \n\nI'll try to keep this short even though I could go on for a while. We were a party of 5 and we were hungry!  We were looking for something close to the condo and Sushi 21 was there. \nWe were seated right away and ate easily over a dozen rolls and appetizers. We all agreed that every roll they brought was delicious. The edamami was hot, salted, and the freshest we've had. Yes, I know it was most likely frozen from the supplier BUT, the difference was that it didn't taste like it had been sitting in the steamer all day.\nSecond, the service was amazing. Never once did empty dishes sit on the table for longer than it took us to put the dish aside and start eating another roll. We asked for fresh wasabi which was brought out in short order and it was delicious! \nThe oysters on the half shell were fresh but, could have used a little more in the way of accoutrements, like horseradish and lemon but, was served properly cut away from the shell and excellent with a spot of sriracha sauce. \nThe tempura battered anything was delicious. The tempura was light, crispy, tasty, and we could tell the oil used was fresh. We had one order each of the ahi tuna, which was thin sliced served two ways.  There's mayonnaise sauce on each style but, one was spicier than the other and both ways were delicious.\nHave I said \"delicious\" enough? No. \nThis is a little gem off the strip, away from the tourist traps and we are so happy to have found it.  If only it was in Reno! \nThe servers are friendly, QUICK and attentive.  We didn't have to wait long for anything. \nOne thing I can say for sure, the sushi houses in Reno need to step it up.  Every sushi house we've eaten at, the tempura is either soggy, or tough, and tasteless and/or cooked in old oil. If the owners of Sushi 21 ever open a sushi house in Reno, we will have permanent reservations! This was the best sushi we have ever eaten.\nThis will be our first dinner stop next trip to Vegas! \nWhen in Las Vegas give Sushi 21 a try. I can't guarantee you will have as good of an experience as we had but, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your meal."

Service was wonderful as the waitress was on top of all of our orders especially in the early feeding frenzy. Super White Tuna was awesome as well as salmon & all their nigri. I guess the rolls were ok but I wasn't that imporessed with them. I have started to venture away from rolls & eat just nigri these days. They do offer 3 slices of 1 fish of your choice sashimi style which was nice. Would go back if I am in the area."

I was really craving some softshell crab, but the roll we ordered was just chopped up imitation crab, which I did not care for.

Sushi house is much better and worth the wait if you have patience. This place don't have a wait which is a plus. But in terms of sushi, it's decent at best. The Uni I got was suppose to be bright yellow. The ones I got was more like brown.... And it didn't taste fresh either. I order the \"something's wrong\" roll which describe having soft shell crab but when I got it, it was fake crab.... HUGE difference there buddy! I guess something was wrong! Not all was bad. Some of their other rolls are pretty decent. Don't get the mochi dessert.

They had great choices, but we chose the ala carte menu, which of course adds up to a lot more, but we wanted things specific that weren't on the all you can eat menu. \nThe food: really good!! the rolls are packed tightly and the baked rolls were perfect temperates. The sashimi was so very flavorful, but I personal would have preferred it more chilled than warm.  But the presentation was beautiful.\nThe only con - is the music videos???? They're a mix of strange asain pop and techno, and just odd and comical. \n\nOverall this is always a great place to go and we will continue to eat here as long as we are in town."

Just the thought of this delectable little dish makes me want to hop in the car and head over for an early dinner. \n\nMeanwhile, if you're going to stick to the menu, I would suggest the popcorn lobster roll - somehow the sweet of the eel sauce and spicy mayo mix with the coolness of the California roll and the heat of the deep fried lobster bites to form the perfect symphony of greatness. Seriously. Try it. \n\nThrow in a two for one deal on hot sake and you've got a pretty freakin amazing meal!"

This place is so good that I felt compelled to start this review while I'm still eating but probably won't finish since the food is that good.

The nigiri here isn't buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness but for AYCE, it's definitely above average and I don't think you'd complain. \n\nSashimi chef choice: it was salmon and same as above. \n\nOysters: so big and good! Only one order per person though. \n\nCrawfish: this dish is so yummy. It's a bunch of crawfish cooked in a delicious sauce. It is a bit greasy though and for a fellow fatty like me to say that means a lot because I love grease. It does have a kick which is great.  \n\nBaby octopus: they're actually pretty big for being \"baby\" and I liked them but without the sauce, they're kinda bland. \n\nSeaweed salad: a must at every sushi restaurant for me and this one was great! \n\nOrleans roll: OMG. This is the best sushi roll I have EVER had. I love cream cheese in my rolls. If you do too and you love salmon and spicy mayo, get this roll. The spicy mayo is actually spicy which is so awesome. This roll makes me want to move to Vegas. Okay that's me being dramatic but seriously, it's just really good okay? \n\nI got the strawberry, green tea and red bean ice cream for dessert and both were good! \n\nThe waitress that was working was such a sweetheart too. She was so nice that when she told me they ran out of uni today, I didn't even get upset and if you know me, I NEED my uni. Hopefully I get to try it next time cause I definitely plan on returning someday!"

This place is open until 3am on a Sunday!  First off we were greeted with big smiles right from the start.  The staff were all extremely friendly. Almost every roll we had was amazing.  The only one I didn't care for as much I don't remember the name of.  The service was excellent and delivery was very fast!  The Strawberry tempura ice cream was sooo good!  The atmosphere is quite pleasant and nicely lit.

The waitress tells me right when I walk in that I made it in time for the all you can eat lunch special for $21.95. So I thought okay cool I'll go ahead and order a couple of things. First of all, it was slow. Nobody was in the restaurant but myself and yet it took 20 minutes for a sushi roll. On top of that, they messed up my order. I asked for a spicy tuna hand roll and instead of what I asked for, I got some crab roll. I brought this to their attention and instead of helping, they just brushed it off like no big deal. I asked for my check, that took another 10 minutes, mind you I'm still the only one in the restaurant, and when I finally got it, it was wrong. THEY WERE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR THE DINNER PRICE! I asked the waitress why is it that I was told it was still lunch and yet I'm getting charged for dinner. She said it was because it was 3:02 when she put the order in and lunch ended at 3. WHAT? She was the one that specifically told me it was still lunch time. She went to go see if her manager can excuse it and give me the lunch price and he said fine I'll give you the lunch price but we're going to charge you the hand roll you didn't touch. Um. You messed up MY order and then expect me to eat it all? I was infuriated. Worst experience ever. I'm never coming back to this sushi place. There are so many other sushi places close by that are better than this one, and they have better service. Don't waste your time here."

THEY OFFER 10% DISCOUNT IF YOU WRITE A REVIEW AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM THE REVIEW YOU WROTE. THATS JUST SO SKETCHY. SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE HIGH RATING OF THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE REVIEWED FOR THE 10% DISCOUNT.\n\nI walked in the restaurant with the boyfriend and OH MY GOSH, I have never seen a waitress that look so rude and mean before in my life. She had hell of an attitude that just showed so clearly on her freaking face, the way she talked and handed our menu. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOURE GOING TO GIVE A DIRTY LOOK LIKE YOU DID, CAN YOU NOT WORK? NO CUSTOMERS WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AND DINE THERE WITH THE CRAPPY SERVICE YOU 'THINK' IS SERVICE.\n\nSo you think I am overreacting? Oh hells no. I have to admit I am very sensitive about customer service. My boyfriend? He likes to keep it to himself and he always tries to stop me if I want to complain to the waiter/waitress. He was the FIRST one to tell me about that waitress. He immediately felt like he wanted to leave but we already stopped by 2 restaurants before this one and we were just SOOOOO HUNGRY to go elsewhere.\n\nSushi was so thin. PERIOD. Fish to rice ratio was so bad. Too much rice and fish was so thin that it was so TRANSPARENT. We didnt order much on our first batch and there were only one or two other tables besides us and it took FOREVER to get our order. We specifically asked no sauce on any of our nigiri and they forgot and put sauce on it. I told that rude waitress about it and she went to go tell the sushi chef and she comes back asking very ruthlessly, 'are you not going to eat that?' I wanted to freaking get up and tell her off because of her arrogant attitude. UGHHHHH. Miso soup was salty as hell. I took a sip and put it to aside.\n\nYou can only order two rounds compared to three at other restaurants. I dont know why this restaurant is still in business and not only that, they definitely need to re-hire the servers and get rid of the rude and arrogant ones. Also, fish meat has to be much more thicker. The sushi chefs need to be more professional. They curse and talk too much when making sushi. They walked out of restaurant with the apron on and came back inside and didnt see then washing hands EVEN THOUGH they wear gloves to make sushi.\n\nI wanted to go to Goyemon but their wait was way too long for two hungry stomachs. This restaurant was probably the worst one out of my Vegas trip this week. I didnt want to leave any tip for the waitress and I do not feel bad about not leaving tip because I have no reason to give her any. My boyfriend said to leave it for the other waitress that was slightly 'better' than the rude one.\n\nI am korean and I do go to Korean owned susbi restaurants because AYCE sushi is mostly ran by Koreans BUT!!! This place is missing every component of a good restaurant.\n\n1. Good food.\n2. Good service.\n3. Good portion.\n\nI am not sure IF this restaurant is affiliated with other Sushi 21 in California in cities like Oceanside and San Pedro but one of them is CLOSED and the other one is BARELY running. Their rating is so low. At least they didnt 'buy' the reviews from customers.\n\nAND NO I DONT NEED YOUR FREAKING 10% DISCOUNT. I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD MY MEAL."

Decent food.\n\nI went with a group of 5 for a co-worker's birthday for the all-you-can-eat-and-drink menu ($36 per person - total of $46 including tax and mandatory 18% gratuity for group over 4 people).\n\nAfter an hour of happy devouring, my hungry co-workers (3 men and 1 girl) finally slowed down, with half a roll of tuna and baked salmon left on the plate. The waitress came by and urged us to cancel the rest of our order until we finish all our sushi, otherwise she said they would charge us. We figured the remaining sushi was equal to one more piece per person to finish, so we insisted on our order of 2-piece sweet shrimp nigiri anyway, because we were craving sweet shrimps. \n\nWe waited for another 15 minutes and asked the waitress twice, yet the sweet shrimp nigiri didn't come. Finally the waitress said that they \"ran out of shrimp and is waiting for shrimp to defrost\". That was when we realized that the waitress was counting on us not to finish our roll, and she was not going to bring out the sweet shrimp nigiri until we finish everything. \n\nSo we did clear our plate, and finally the sweet shrimp nigiri came. I know sweet shrimp is considered a more expensive item, but this behavior from the restaurant management just feels petty. Considered how much the cost was per person, and that our group was well-behaved and not rowdy, this is no way for a business to treat customers!"

Generous amount of tuna in the Spicy Tuna roll, and I appreciated that they gave us eel sauce on the side for the Las Vegas roll. \n\nWas this the best sushi ever? No, not even close.

They only brought two rolls at a time, and we'd wait anywhere from 10-45 minutes for the next roll. We never got everything we ordered, and every time we'd tell a waitress we were still waiting on rolls, she'd just nod yes. There was a huge language barrier and when we asked to talk to the manager, she didn't understand what we were telling her. Everyone went home hungry and wound up eating at home. \n\nAlso when it came time to get the check? Somehow our 4 all you can eats, with 4 drinks totaled to $150, they totally overcharged us AND added an 18% gratuity for our table, nowhere in the establishment does it say that gratuity is charged for parties of 4."

So I figured let's see if they're giving goyemon a run for their money.  HAHAHAHAHA not even close.\n\nTuesday night, 6 pm and there were 3 people in there, and no one else came in there the hour that I was there.  That's a BAAAAAD sign.  Typically tuesday is when sushi restaurants get their fresh fish and deliveries. If I recall, the fish markets are closed on mondays and there are no shipments.  So Tuesday & Wednesdays are the best days to go.  \n\nWithout even asking, they brought me edamame and miso soup.  I don't particularly care for when someone brings me something that I didn't order.  Their miso soup was lacking flavor and only had 2 spoonfulls, their edamame was fine.\n\nOn an all you can eat place, portions should be small-medium.  I ordered the sashimi salad and it was in a large bowl (toooo much) and the taste was just ok, it tasted like they put their garlic sauce that they put on their sushi rolls, onto their salad.  Maybe some people like this, but I sure didn't.\n\nTheir sushi rolls were avg. I saw lots of rolls on their menu that were based on california rolls and to me that is a sign of cheapness.  Another typical bad sign is when you can't order directly from the chef. They use the paper order forms and quite frankly I HATE the paper order forms.  \n\nI ordered 2 sushi rolls and they were just ok\n\nand then I ordered some nigiri and this sealed the deal that this place is bad...\n\nI ordered 2 hamachi and 1 super white (both were good)\nI ordered 1 order each of snow crab, uni and amaebi (sweet shrimp)  I didn't get any of those orders. The show crab was still frozen (I saw him put the large frozen block of it into the fridge behind the counter), and then he apologized they are out of uni and sweet shrimp.  Guess what folks...  Sushi mon and Goyemon are never out of it.\n\nand that leads me back to what I wrote above. Everything is usually fresh/delivered on tuesdays.  So where's your fish at????? \n\nSorry but for being 2 min up the street from goyemon (even if their servers are slow, the food is fantastic) I'm goin there instead"

After we were done paying, the same chef followed us all the way to the door and started yelling in his own language and started throwing salt all around us. I know in some Asian countries they use salt for purification purpose, and therefore by throwing the salt around us he was treating us as \"bad luck.\" I would be surprised if he still works there because no one would want to hire such a rude crazy chef like him."

We ate oysters, spicy crawfish  and marinated beef in addition to the great selection of rolls- King of Ocean and Banzai were our favorites.  The service was great from the sushi chef, Johnny, and waitresses.  I will definitely come back on our next trip to Las Vegas.\n\nJeff H."
