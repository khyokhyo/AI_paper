            "review": "This was the answer to a several month long search for a simple but ass kicking great tasting Italian meal. It was a busy Tuesday night, so we took a bar seat and enjoyed the great bartending by Mike. We asked him about a wine, he said it was good. When he brought the bottle it was a screw top... I was a bit concerned with the screw top. We had the wine with dinner and enjoyed a great meal. We met some nice peeps next to us and had some great conversation and a most enjoyable evening. Thank you Mike and Buddy V\"s for a most enjoyable time and meal. We'll be back. Highly recommend for great tasting authentic style Italian food, with a classy twist."

My only complaint would have my balsamic salad dressing was below standard although the ingredients of the salad were good quality.  The Lasagna is a mega-meal onto itself.  The Tomato Basil soup was good and my wife loved her Spaghetti Bologanese.  The Raspberry Sorbet was excellent!"

Buddy V's fulfilled my brunch expectations and was trully wonderful. Each bite was amazing! I will absolutely come back on our next visit. Don't leave Vegas without coming here, and specifically Sunday Brunch. Try everything!!"

We had the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer, which was AMAZING. Seriously we both moaned upon the first bite. For my main entr\u00e9e, I got the Chicken Rigatoni and it was soooo good! The portion size was perfect and the pasta was very delicious! For dessert I got the italian donuts which were also delicious! My favorite was the strawberry one, but the chocolate was a close second! Our server was awesome too, he was very attentive and we never went too long without seeing him. I would definitely come back to Buddy V's!"

If this is suppose to be a family friendly restaurant I definitely didn't get that feel. Half our party arrived and sat down and began eating. Then the rest of us joined them about 15 minutes later. We stood there waiting to be seated with our group for about another 10 by that time some of our group had finished eating stood up and left so we could sit. No one came to ask if we needed help as we stood next the table. Like I said food Amazing service Subpar at best."

I had the Blackberry Collins (drink) and it was delicious. My brother had the drink with Jalape\u00f1o and mango and it was so good. Alex Rivera was thee best server I have come across. His skills with explaining the menu to giving us options on what is the \"thing\" to eat. I ended up eating the Osso Buco. It was soooo tender and the flavor was impeccably mastered. I highly suggest going here. Ask for Alex to be your server! I was impressed, hopefully you will be too."

Our waiter brought us the drinks and dinner menu and took our orders right away. I ordered the creamy tomato chicken pasta (forgot the exact name), my hubby ordered a meat source pasta and we ordered a Mac and cheese for our toodler. Before the meal, they gave us a piece of freshly baked bread to start with. Our meals came fast and it looked and tasted very good. We finished everything fast. Our waiter was very attentive and the restaurant was nice with live music. \n\noyster bar at harrah's, this restaurant only charged me 9 dollars for the kid meal with a much better service and food. And you charged us 11 bucks for a plain white rice and a piece of dry chicken breast."

I've been here both during lunch and dinner, but at night it has a more dark tone with warm lights, great for a romantic night but good too for families. No matter what table you are seated in, you will have a view of the kitchen and the chefs. \n\nOur server Brittany was really nice and bubbly. I was having trouble deciding between the scallops and the chicken parm, she recommended the chicken parm and assured me that in case I didn't like it that I could order something else. \n\nBut she was right! The chicken parm was delicious! I personally don't like chicken, but this was juicy and crunchy, covered with hot marinara sauce and cheese covering it all.  It also came with spaghetti marinara on the side. \n\nMy friend was jealous and wish she had gotten mine. She ordered the seabass, which was flaky and good  too, but I still liked mine better."

            "review": "Located in the Palazzo Hotel, it's not the best Italian food on the Strip, plus the service was poor. We spotted this restaurant, after seeing the huge line for Carlos' Bakery. That's the bakery from the TV show Cake Boss. Honestly, who would wait 30 minutes for a pastry, when Sprinkles Cupcakes is down the street and pure perfection. Anyway, we saw Buddy V's and read the menu at the front door. The prices seemed reasonable for a Strip restaurant, so we made reservations for 7:00 p.m. We arrived on time, only to wait 30 minutes while they took walk-ins before us. Once seated, the greeting was non-existent. I actually had to stop our waiter, and ask what his name was. It was Chas. After bringing our beverages, he quickly recited the one special, and he asked what we wanted. Totally rushed. I stopped him right there, and began asking questions about the restaurant. \"Chas, who is Carlos?\" \"If Carlos and Buddy V are famous for their cakes, why did they open an Italian restaurant?\" As he became increasingly annoyed with my questions, he explained that the restaurant is based on Buddy V's grandmother's recipes, not Buddy's recipes. Naturally, I commented that Buddy V shouldn't have his name on the restaurant if they're not his recipes. Oh well, just a logically conclusion. The veal Marsala came with a side of pasta. The pasta was good, but the veal Marsala was tough and the sauce was tasteless. Really salty and bland. Our dining experience lasted a quick 35 minutes...even with my insistent questions. Don't waste your money or 35 minutes eating here. There's lots better Italian restaurants on The Strip."

            "review": "The food was excellent and with it being a newly opened I expected some issues. When we first arrived the waiter was not my favorite and was extremely rude, once he realized that we were there during restaurant week. But I spoke to the manager and she switched us to a new server. This guy made our night and I would go back just for him to serve us again. The chicken parm was the best I have ever had and lobster tail dessert was amazing. The only other issue was that we got a child's pizza for my son and it arrived after the rest of us were done with our meals. But the problem was fixed again by same manager and they took it off our bill."

            "review": "Maybe I expected a lot more because of the name behind it. I Have to admit I was pretty excited to try this place out and not that I was disappointed but more so I wasn't wowed or left with a \"can't wait to come back\" feeling. A couple friends were in town and like any vegas visitor wanted to try something new. We came for Sunday brunch and instead of ordering off the regular menu they offer a Sunday brunch buffet. Though the selection was more than enough to fill me up, don't expect a lot of food (the idea most might get when thinking of a vegas buffet).  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular but very well presented. First time ever seeing dragonfruit and lychees (served in original shell and \"hair\") in a restaurant so that was new for me. Disappointment #1 for the price you are kind of better off checking out one of the other casino buffets.\n\nThe restaurant itself was cute, family like and had a really open feeling. Love the concept of the open kitchen! \n\nAs for service, this would be disappointment #2. Our server sold us the idea of unlimited drinks for an upgrade (of course) but the fact we only saw him 2 times our entire visit, limited the drinks we could order. We had to ask our busser on 3 different occasions for more water. Plus side though the bloody mary bar was pretty neat, lots of hot sauce options, vegetables and additions to choose from...good touch! We could tell they were a bit short handed since we only saw 3 servers (from what we could tell) covering the entire floor and they were fairly busy.  So we cut him some slack because he was very nice. \n\nHostess staff was a little rude and not very personable but our interaction with them was short enough to make it tolerable. \n\nWe wanted to visit the bakery but the line was so long we decided against it. I'm a local so not sure I would visit again unless visitors from out of town really want to go, but even then I might suggest another spot."

I was spectacle about coming here for good Italian food but we were in Vegas and hungry so we gave it a shoot. First we didn't have a reservation but they sat us in only 15 min wait time. So while at the bar I seen they have a signature The Cake Boss Martini and let me tell you it was best martini I have had in a long time! The garlic bread was awesome, portions are huge and the desert is wonderful. We even talked to the manager Stewart and expressed what a great place this was to visit!"

            "review": "We recently visited Buddy V's before seeing a show on a Saturday. The restaurant didn't seem too busy for a Saturday night, the view was pretty nice as the sun was setting. The noise level was a little high and we weren't thrilled by the seating. A lot of the tables were up against a very long bench seat which they all shared. This created a situation where we felt like we were having dinner with the two sets of people on each side of us.\n\nOur waitress wasn't too attentive, but our bus boy was pretty awesome! The food was really good and the potion size was huge. After eating my lasagne it looked as if I didn't even touch it. \n\nThe most awesome part was the dessert... I love canolis! They were fabulous!! Perfect hint of cinnamon in the pastry and super yummy cream! My husband has the tiramisu which he said was also great."

            "review": "AMAZING DINNER! I went to Buddy V's with my family and was a bit nervous at first. I love the show and have been dying to try this restaurant since Buddy announced he was opening it. It was probably one of the best Italian meals I have had in a long time, the meatballs were amazing, great portion size and lots of flavour. The caesar salad was also good, very garlicky which I like. Next was the mains, we got a few but the most memorable were the shrimp pasta and the spaghetti and meatballs. Both had tons of flavour and great portion sizes. We were celebrating my 25th birthday and all I wanted was to try something at Carlos Bakery. The manager was incredible, he went across to the bakery and got me a cupcake because he knew how much I wanted to try it and the line was crazy. For dessert, we also had the apple pie, this was the only item we ordered I was not crazy about. It came out like a hard cookie shell and it was nothing to write home about. The waiter was very annoying, he kept trying to push us to order things and he didn't take no for an answer until we said it more firmly. However, overall, it was a great meal. The manager Adam was very nice and seemed to really enjoy his job. He was all about customer service and customer satisfaction. \nMy only recommendation is people who dine at the restaurant should also be able to go to the bakery."

            "review": "I just returned home from a trip to Las Vegas with a girlfriend of mine. One of the highlights of our trip was to go to the Carlo's Bakery and Buddy Restaurant. Although the treats at the bakery were amazing we were extremely disappointed by how we were treated by one of the male wait staff at the restaurant. We are in our mid twenties and I feel like he didn't respect us as customers. We ordered a few cocktails as well as the cheeseboard. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't know if you will see this but I think everyone should be treated fairly dining at the restaurant (also the opening time on the website is wrong). That part of our trip was ruined. I love the show and am a huge fan."

Arrived a bit early for our reservation and were greeted by two extremely friendly and gracious hostesses who said they were happy to seat us early!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very clean, looks brand new inside although it's a couple years old! We were seated in a lively bustling dining area. And a young man immediately, upon us sitting down, took our drink order and poured us water. Right after that Caleb (our waiter) arrived, wished us a happy anniversary and asked if we would like to move to a more private table with a special view..we agreed of course and within 2 minutes he had checked with the hostess stand and ushered us to the back of the restaurant where the bustling was at a minimum and sat us at a beautiful table looking out over the palazzo and the strip. Was already amazed at this point and we hadn't even ordered yet! Caleb then spent a few minutes chatting with us and made some recommendations, we ordered the recommended appetizer a crispy mozzarella bread in red sauce..OMG they brought it so fast and it was to die for...could have just eaten that for dinner. I had the 3 course special, chose Caesar salad(amazing), chicken parm(light and Delish..ate the whole thing) and the Nutella chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream(words can't describe how Devine) hubby ordered the bone in veal parm chop. He was in heaven!! Throughout the meal Caleb gave us just enough attention but was careful to give us space to enjoy our meal, the wait staff had our drinks filled any time they were half empty...never had to ask for a refill and even completely cleared and wiped down our table before bringing desert. I've dined at many 4 and 5 star establishments who could take a lesson in customer service and good food quality from Buddy V's. Thank you Caleb and the staff for a meal and experience 2nd to none, and for making our Anniversary dinner one we will never forget!"

            "review": "Where to start...\n\nLocation is awkward (end of a mostly deserted hallway) and was certainly of no help to former occupant FIRST Food and Bar.\n\nAmbiance inside the restaurant itself is quite nice, although tables thrown in the hallway seem strange.  Outdoor seating is laughable and ill-conceived.  It's essentially at the top of an escalator leading up from Walgreens/down to the Strip so plenty of foot traffic will get to check-out your food.  The outdoor view is obstructed by a wall.  This area was never intended for restaurant seating and has emerged as a hot spot for Grand Canal Shoppes' employees to congregate and smoke.  Enjoy!\n\nService is slow and uninterested, perhaps even worse than FIRST.  Maybe the same staff?  A friend of mine said he and his date waited 15 minutes at an empty bar to be acknowledged, let alone served.  He was so aggravated they left without eating.  He's a bartender in the Venetian and understands the importance of timely service.  My experience wasn't much better.\n\nMy food was bland, we're talking CPK bland.  A penne dish was swimming in flavorless oil and assorted vegetables that looked to be left-over from some other dish and the chicken parm was just as bland.  Skipped dessert which was probably my mistake given that's the namesake's claim to fame.  Speaking of, who thought naming an Italian restaurant after a well-known PASTRY chef was a good idea?\n\nI've already spent too much energy on this place.  Maybe it will improve and it seems others have had better experiences, but I won't give it a second go."

After all, this guy is a baker not a restaurant chef and every celebrity food person has a place in Vegas and most aren't anything to write home about.  This place is outstanding. Their Cesar salad is a must. They serve it with warm polenta croutons. Talk about a bowl of heaven. Crispy on the outside and full of warm polenta goodness. Yes, I wrote 3 sentences about croutons. They are that good. After that I moved onto the scallops. Sweet, briney with the perfect sear on the outside. Delicious. This has become our must eat at place every time we pass through town. Great wine list, fair prices, excellent service. Worth a visit.\n\nWe made a stop for lunch and found the treat of a 3 course meal for $22. I got the Cesar salad, chicken parm with salted caramel gelato. The chicken itself was okay but the pasta was delicious. The gelato was worth a stop in itself."

She made a reservation for a Sunday night lucky as they were really busy. We were seated within 5 mins of arrival at a table beside the kitchen, within 2 mins our waiter came over to offer us a quieter table in the corner near the window and had our drinks within 5 mins. I ordered caesars salad for appetiser my wife had Grandmas meatballs, both meals were amazing you could see the herbs in the meatballs and the flavour was incredible, my Caesars salad was fresh and croutons were not to crunchy but fresh. We ordered off a theatre special menu which was $38 each for a 3 course meal which we thought was pretty cheap ( being from Australia its hard to find an entree for around that price so this was cheap for us). My Entree was chicken parma and my wife had Buddy SNR Bucatini carbonara, dessert was Nutella cake and a cannoli which we took desserts back to hotel room as we were full from our mains. All in all this restaurant was AMAZEBALLS  we will be returning again in the future and to top it off we went to Carlos bakery  right across from the restaurant.\n\nBeware alcohol is pricey....\n\nBONUS our waiter looked like THE ROCK!!!!!"

You get the plaid napkins, Torino breadsticks, a wide variety of Italian entrees and desserts. The desserts are from none other than Carlo's bake shop so you'll be in for a fine treat. I personally ordered the Sunday Gravy entree and it was one of the best Italian dishes I've had in awhile. It's tomato stew served with tender veal, homemade Italian sausage and meatballs served with rigatoni. Think of it as spaghetti with meatballs but more variety of meat for you meat lovers.

I paid $24 for some of the most amazing chicken parmesan at Buddy Vs. I know which I'll be going back for next time. \nWe started with the salumi and cheese board. Everything on the board tasted great. You really get a lot. We had a party of six and didn't eat all of it. I loved the pickled peppers that came with it. \nI had the chicken parmesan. Crispy breaded chicken with delicious marinara sauce covered in gooey cheese. So freaking good! It came with a side of spaghetti which I don't normally care for (don't shoot me), but theirs was really good. I just couldn't eat it all, and I'm a big guy. \nMy wife had the chicken piccata.

            "review": "Who's not a fan of Buddy V? I drool over the eye candy on Cake Boss (the food eye candy!).  When I realized that Buddy brought Jersey to Vegas, I couldn't wait to try it. It's difficult to find a restaurant on the strip that has character, good food, and great service. Buddy V's has all three. We made reservations on a weekday evening and the restaurant was about 3/4 full. The ambiance was casual with an upscale Italian vibe; translation: fine dining without leaving a hole in your pocket. Win Win. There were two people taking care of our table, so we got double the attention and service. Both our waiter and waitress were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered \"My Wife's Eggplant Parm\" as an appetizer and chicken rigatoni alla vodka and Nonna's lasagna al forno as our mains. \n\nMy Wife's Eggplant Parm- clever! I like how Buddy gives cred to those who deserve it. The eggplant parm was pretty much a tower of crispy goodness. Eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato parm, eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato, parm...you get the picture. The eggplant was had a nice crunch and the melty cheese and tart tomato sauce were a delicious combo. I'm using to a more traditional baked eggplant parm as opposed to the deep fried dish that was served. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I was missing the deep flavors of the eggplant that was fried away. \n\nChicken rigatoni alla vodka- rigatoni, pancetta, grilled chicken swimming in a decadent tomato cream sauce was heaven. I really enjoyed the creaminess of this dish. The sauce was a perfect combination of flavors (it's all about the sauce). This pancetta was a nice touch of smokiness. Super filling, you will have leftovers! \n\nNonna's lasagna al forno- YES. CHEESY, MEATY, traditional lasagna with a ton of flavor. This hefty lasagna had Italian sausage, beef and pork, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan baked to perfection. Four types of cheeses people. It was cheesy. If you are looking for a classic and delicious lasagna, look no further. The only thing I was missing was a bit of sweetness in the tomato sauce. Otherwise, I would absolutely order this item again. Totally big enough to split. \n\nI truly enjoy traditional Italian food. Big portions, big flavors and lots of sauce. Warning, you will be in a food coma after you finish your meal. Come with an empty belly and be prepared to eat. We had a ton of leftovers which is what should happen when you go out for Italian food. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant, the ambiance, as well as the service. We let our waitress know that we were on a time crunch, and she got us in and out of the restaurant in no time with full bellies and smiles on our faces. This restaurant was closer to Palazzo then Venetian and somewhat of a mission to find, but we found it and we were glad we did. A very solid option of casual Italian food in the heart of LV."

            "review": "Looking back at this experience, I'm actually angry. Maybe it deserves a 2, but this is the worst experience I've had on strip, I expected much better. I feel used, dirty. We had a party of 8, 4 couples. I brought 2 bottles of wine (tempranillo and a cab/syrah) intending to pay the corkage fee, which turned out to be $35 (highest I've ever encountered). The waiter said that since we were Seahawks fans and he was too (night before the super bowl) he would waive one of the fees if we tipped him more, more or less, even though he'd rather see us enjoy an Italian wine with dinner.  After examining the wine list we opted for the ones I brought. The waiter also informed us that since we were a big party we should take advantage of an \"appetizer platter\" for us all to share, meats, cheeses and salad, sold to us as a family style Italian sharing experience. We talked it over and all agreed it sounded good. Then we ordered our entrees, 1 couple opted to split the ravioli, my boyfriend ordered the lasagna and I planned on ordering the small margherita pizza so we could share. When I tried to order my margherita the waiter told me it was really small, just an appetizer, I told him I wanted small because I wasn't terribly hungry and didn't want leftovers, he insisted I should get the chicken alla vodka because they had just won an award for it, I asked if it was small, he said \"oh yes, very small\" and gestured with his hands. I caved, and ordered it, after all, I do love pasta and vodka sauce.  Appetizers came shortly after, 2 different salads, 2 meat/cheese/bread platters, calamari, and the meatballs (6). It was all ok, nothing spectacular, but one of the salads was pretty good (it had arugula, yum), and the meatballs were pretty good (nothing compared to Casa di Amore's off-strip though). The entrees came and my pasta was huge (bigger than he implied at least, average dish size for most restaurants though). My noodles were undercooked and the chicken was incredibly dry, sauce was decent, but not enough to make the chicken palatable.  I gave away most of my dish to the couple who split the ravioli, as they were pretty underwhelmed with theirs too, and thought mine was a slight improvement. I took one ravioli in exchange and nibbled my boyfriend's lasagna which was actually pretty amazing (in comparison), meanwhile kicking myself that I didn't just stick with the pizza.  The check came, north of $400, turns out the appetizers were all billed separately, so we should have just ordered what we wanted to begin with.  Looking back I'm convinced that the waiter only wanted me to have the more expensive entree, not the one I'd be happy with, and it angers me that he wouldn't just take my order as I intended. I suppose I've learned my lesson, stay away from gimmicky strip restaurants, stick to your guns, and recognize the upselling. What a swindle, this waiter put used car salesmen to shame, I've never felt more used after a dining experience, and the food was mediocre at best. I'm pretty sure he wasn't really a Seahawks fan either. Buyer beware. We'll stick with Casa in the future."

I recommend the Calamari for an appetizer or the mozzarella en Carozza, which is basically fried mozzarella. I have only been here once so the dish I had was the lasagna.

We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant. \n\nSo we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. \n\nWe wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \"ALLA VODKA\". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. \n\nOh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a caf\u00e9 type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. \n\nBut not to jam on Buddy over his place. We had the Italian birthday cake and let me tell you it was no disappointment. We loved it and that what Buddy is famous for Cakes. I wish he had a bakery with the restaurant because that would go no stop. Hope this helps you guys out. thanks"

Setting tables, refilling drinks, bringing bread, etc.  It was a very unique concept that I had never seen before.  It made things run so smoothly. \n\nThey start you off with some amazing complementary focaccia bread. It is seasoned with some Italian seasonings and cheese. It was piping hot when delivered to us in a very cute basket.  I ordered Nonna's lasagna AL forno. The waiter asked if I was ready for the most incredible lasagna I've ever eaten?! To be honest I was kind of thinking \"ya right.\"  well...  He was right! It really was the best lasagna I've ever had! The presentation was great as well.  It came in a cute little cast iron skillet. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread.  It was good but I honestly liked the focaccia bread better! \n\nYou will not be disappointed coming here.

I have been wanting to come to this place for some time as I'm a huge fan of Buddy!! \n\nWe show up and get seated very quickly it was about 8:45-9:00pm we are sitting for five minutes when a biased comes to the table and asks us if we would like some water...sure he brings us water...we've never been here before so we are taking our time with the menu and decide to order mozzarella as an appetizer when our server finally arrived at our table we had already drank our glass of water it was a good 15 minutes after we sat down...unacceptable if you ask me! I don't know his name cause he talked so fast and was trying really hard with what seemed like a fake accent to be \"cool\" and laughed at himself....we told him we've never been here and that we would like to order the mozzarella...he then said are you ready to put on your Order for dinner...I said could I have a few minutes he then proceeded to say that I wanted the Veil Parmesan without giving me time to look uhh ok I guess I'll have that since you are in such a rush for me to order when you haven't even put in my appetizer...my boyfriend ordered lasagna...\nI never saw my server again...well not willingly anyways...I had to flag him down for more water...the buss men were passing out cheese bread and vinegar and oil to every table that was there...except us not once were we offered anything nor where my drinks refilled without having to ask!! I wanted to order a soda and nope didn't even get to do that!!!\nOur appetizer came was different and so yummy!!! Server never came to see how we where....our food came no server nothing...what if I didn't like my food...oh but I had to flag a biased down again for more water even though they have walked by my table 100 times and I know they seen my water empty!!!\nSo on with it...I had to yell for my server who had been ignoring us after I've asked for him 3 times by a bus man he came I said may I please have a box...10 min later my box arrived...he asked if we wanted desert I said may I see a menu!!(been wanting Buddy's lobster take for years almost went to New Jersey just to try one!!) then my boyfriend asks for a manager cause the special request he set up was to have a lobster tail desert show up to the table as a surprise with writing on the plate saying happy anniversary....my boyfriend was so upset that they ruined the surprised when he talked to the manager he kind of still felt like it was no big deal!! A new server delivered our desert and the comped it(didn't asked them to nor did we want them to) \n\nAt the end of everything the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! I have been in customer service my whole life never would I treat someone the way we were treated!! We felt abandoned when the people around us where being well taken care of!!!\n\nI give a HUGE SHOUT OUT TO THE KITCHEN THOUGH!! FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! I don't eat leftovers never have my whole life but I did eat the left overs for dinner Saturday!! That says something!!\n\nJust disappointing about the service kind of heartbroken cause j was so excited to finally be going to BUDDY V's"

Your staff is going to kill your business and should not be tolerated. Our bill was wrong. you name it. and....the best of all--our friend ordered spaghetti/meatballs. He opted for sausage instead. So, he was $6 for CRUMBLED SAUSAGE? WHAT? We discussed with waitress and she was defensive telling him \"i distinctly told you it was crumbles\" Well, she did not tell him $6 for crumbles. Whole sausage are only available at DINNER? Not cool at all. His family needs to get over there and educated their staff or this place will FALL! I will NOT be back.

I like wine, but am not an expert, so when I recognize a bunch of the wines as the variety I can find at my local Smith's, I am a bit let down.  I finally ordered a bottle of an Italian variety I liked, but when it came time for the sample taste I was almost tempted to refuse it.  It wasn't spoiled, but sure did taste as though it had been stored at the wrong temperature.\nFor entrees, we tried the lasagne, Dad's Bucatini and spaghetti and meatballs.  Again, all the dishes were good.  I especially loved the Bucatini and would get it again.  Desserts were not quite as good as I expected.  The cannoli were fresh, but the filling was lighter than the ricotta I expected and overall had a strong cinnamon oil taste.

I really enjoyed this one with a little grated parmesan and crushed red pepper. 4.5/5\n\nBuddy's Favorite Pizza:  spiced sausage, caramelized onions, fennel, four cheese. I didn't care for this one too much. The sausage and the blend of cheese didn't go well together. I would definitely go with the margherita pizza instead. 2.5/5\n\nSpaghetti Central with Meatballs: Your basic and simple spaghetti with five meatballs. It was simple, but I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato sauce. I thought it had excellent flavor. I would definitely order this again and maybe try it with the bolognese next time. 4/5\n\nChicken Parm: Provolone, mozzarella, spaghetti marinara. This dish was excellent for sharing. It would have been too heavy if one person just got it, but it was great for our group. They give two chicken breasts with a decent portion of spaghetti on the side. The chicken parm was deliciously cheesy! 4/5\n\nOverall, I was extremely pleased with the service and food at Buddy V's Ristorante. I will definitely be back for more of that tomato sauce goodness. The only thing that can possibly make this place any better is if they served you some fresh break with oil and balsamic in the beginning. Just saying... \n\nENJOY!"

Nice place. Sucks cause we were too full to eat or have room for desserts. Happy note is Carlos bakery is right across the way. This place is at the Venetian."

All I have to say is that I was disturbed by my meatballs. I was flat out disappointed by my meatballs. Those were not good meatballs. \n\nI had spaghetti and meatballs. My first cause for concern was that our dishes came out insanely fast. Never a good sign in my book. I'm not at Burger King, I do no expect my food to arrive in less than five minutes. The meatballs were small and when I split one with my fork, it did not crumble like a freshly made meatball should. It was hard. And I bet you anything it had been frozen at one point. Sauce was incredibly bland. I was incredibly disappointed. \n\nMain cause for disappointment? This was not my first time here. I've had their meatballs before. They were heavenly, delicious, tasty and FRESH! \n\nSaving grace was their Italian Cake. That was pretty good. But as for the meal, all I can say is how corporate of them."

I don't entirely blame her I would probably have a bad attitude if I was all by myself on a Friday night . The part that really mad me mad was that there were 2 managers just standing around doing nothing. When I asked one of the managers if he could help he said we had to wait for the the hostess and he couldn't help us. When we finally did get seated we were sat in the bar. That would of been fine but in the bar they had one waiter to take care of the entire bar area while the two managers sat and ate at the bar. The food took for ever and they even showed up with the wrong food for my mother and that took 15 minutes to get her food while we starred at are food till she got hers .the food was just alright and way over priced. I was disappointed"

Went personally at noon to confirm reservations, as the two ladies in our party of four were celebrating birthdays, and wanted to make sure we would get window seats.  The original reservations were made at the same time room reservations were made by the pallazo hotel.  We were told we would be given window seats. Well the hostess said she could not guarantee, but made a note of the request as well as the birthday celebration.\nWe arrived at 4:45pm fifteen minutes early, and found an almost empty restaurant.  As luck would have it, the original hostess was there.  She said she would be able to seat us \"near\" a window table.  I laughed and said, well it looks as though you have lots of tables.....her comment was to go sit in the lounge \"bar\" area until our reservation time.  Trying to sell drinks I suppose.  We sat there , not ordering drinks, and she started to seat us away from the window....again I reminded her, and miraculously she found a table.. It dawned on me later (after my wife explained) she was fishing for a tip to \"find a table\"\nAnyway, we ordered.   The Lasagna came, large portion, lots of cheese and meat, little skimpy on the sauce.  Wife had Chicken Parmesan which was overcooked and little sauce.  The other couples order consisted of a new York steak which she raved about, but her husband had steak and lobster, and said the steak he had was tough, but the lobster was good.  \nTable service was good, lots of flat bread, water refills.\nOh....if you happen to like a nice fruity White Zinfandel (the fastest growing wine category in the US) you will not get it there.. They don't carry one,  I know some restaurants are a bit snobbish because its a \"blend\"  \n\nSo regarding the birthdays?  Well most restaurants will make an effort to do something to acknowledge a celebration.... Desert came and went, nothing...\n\nAnyway, I know they have not been open for very long.  Our waiter was good, food runners ok...The Floor manager spent his time looking from a distance, but made no contact with the customers.  \n\nPlace looks nice, food ok, price ok....but Buddy......you need to instill a little passion in your place...Your gonna have to step it up to compete with the upscale establisments located in the same building."

It's \"real\" Italian food that tastes homemade but is served in a Strip-type location and atmosphere. I especially love the ravioli. We've tried the Sunday gravy, the lasagna, the spaghetti, the Veal parmesan, the kale (which is amazing) and my favorite the parmesan polenta (delicious). Really I have never had anything that wasn't good at Buddy V's. The tiramisu is excellent (although I admit I was very disappointed when they went away from the traditional large portion down to the small mason jar). They used to have an amazing portion tiramisu  with surprisingly moist chocolate cake at the bottom. I have eaten a LOT of tiramisu all over the country and this is hands down the best. Even better than the great restaurants I enjoyed in NYC. If you'er a local or are in Vegas for a vacation, go to Buddy V's."

Clearly a dining world record.\n\nOur server Kristin had impeccable recommendations. We started off with the caprese salad and then had lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs for our entrees. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. Everything was piping hot, fresh and flavorful. After the complimentary bread and breadsticks, there was no way we could eat all that food. Portions are this side of ginormous.\n\nThe manager Adam came by to check on us and chatted about other Vegas restaurants we had been to even offering future menu suggestions for a steakhouse we had been to the night before. He clearly runs a tight ship while making sure guests are well taken care of and well fed.\n\nWill definitely be adding Buddy V's to my list of Vegas faves!"

This restaurant cannot compete with anything else nearby.  Maggiano's -fabulous, Brio - lovely, Buddy V's -meh.  We had the meatball sand and the vodka sauce pasta.  Both were bland, small and overpriced ($23 for a very small plate of pasta.). No hot bread and butter, no attentive wait staff, no one asked how are meals were, we were invisible.  Then we come to the real reason we went - the lobster tail pastry.  At $15 we were sure it would be crazy good.  It wasn't. The cream inside was luscious and the presentation was beautiful, but the pastry itself was so hard and overcooked we couldn't cut it and that made sharing difficult.  Worst of all, I left my commemorative photo of my little girl and I from  the National Geographic exhibit on the table.  When we realized this 2 hours later we rushed back to the restaurant.  They had thrown it out!  Who doesn't keep people's forgotten things for at least the rest of the day?!  A very bad $64 lunch and a sad tale to tell."

We made a reservation and were seated at one of the two chef's tables.  After giving us the details on the family style meal not on the menu our waiter filled our drinks.  Then we met Kaleb... Nope not our waiter.  He informed us we were being moved because they wanted to use our table for a 12 top.  There were six of us.  He didn't ask he told us we needed to get up and move and leave our drinks on the table.   We asked what was going on.  He just kept saying we had to move.  So as we were being basically pushed to another table at the back of the place he was being a jerk through the process.  Then he tried to switch us from the lunch menu to he dinner menu without explaining what the difference was.  Also telling us he would get a free desert for one of us.  Apparently the menu change is basically a higher price and more items.  Luckily he wasn't going to be our waiter at the new table.  As most should do we called the manager over.  He apologizes and asks us if we want a different table.   Which we didn't care about the table.  He was missing the point Kaleb was being a jerk.  He offered at least free desert to all of us.  We even confirmed it was all of us and not one of us.   Our waitress Kristy... Was amazing!!! So again take note this 1 star rating is not the norm... we generally would give it 5.  Kaleb should get a 0.  Even a few of the staff agreed and confirmed Kaleb was a jerk.  The manager was subpar.  When ordering the apparently free desert we were told it was for 4 of us.   Our waitress went and made sure it was adjusted to what was promised.  Again, We would request Kristy because her service was amazing and she dealt with the situation better than the manager.  When we left 2 hours in... The 12 top never showed up.  We were going to order the family dinner.  So they lost out on probably twice bill and still would have been able to seat the 12 top.  When we told the manager on the way out that that party never showed he said they had to save the reservation and we should be happy because he bought us over $100 worth of desert.  We reminded him that 6 people x $9 doesn't quite equal that.  He says ... \"Well I tried.\" We didn't care about the free desert.  It was how the restaurant handled it.  The point is how this situation was handled.  In our opinion ... It was terrible."

The first time was for a late Sunday brunch, but we just got there too late for the buffet brunch, which looked really good. Gonna definitely have to come back for that some time.\n\nMe and my date tried the salumi plate, which was pretty good, especially since it came with crispy grilled baguette slices. Schmeared some of the blue cheese on a slice and then layered the salumi and prosciutto for a nice little open face mini-sammy. Yum! I ordered the chicken parm, which came with a side of spaghetti marinara and my date ordered the caesar salad and we split them both between us, which was more than enough food since the caesar was pretty good size and the chicken parm came with two equal sized filets covered with cheese and sauce. The caesar came with polenta croutons, which were amazing and would have been a great appetizer on their own with a side of red sauce! Crispy on the outside and warm and fuzzy in the middle. Almost took away from how good the caesar was. My date thought there was too much dressing, but I like it that way. The chicken parm was awesome! Probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Good thick tender piece of chicken, nice breading, and great cheese to chicken ration with a nice marinara on top. But the coup de gr\u00e2ce was the unassuming side of pasta on the dish. I don't know what it was, but it was just spaghetti marinara but the size and texture of the pasta was just amazing. It was like the unknown actor stealing the spotlight from all the big name actors in a movie! \n\nI went back for lunch later in the week and got the Express lunch for $22 which included a 3 course selection. I got the caesar, spaghetti bolognese, and lemon sorbet. All were awesome, expecially for the price. But the spaghetti again was amazing. And the bolognese sauce was nice and thick and held to the pasta like glue. Easily the best spaghetti dish I've ever had. Again, I don't know what it was about the pasta (size? texture? taste? perfectly al dente?) but it was like crack in pasta form. I can't wait to go back! And this is from a guy who try's not to eat pasta much because it's a carb bomb. And I don't think I've ever had a more perfectly balanced sorbet. Not too sweet, not too tart (lemon sorbet). And 2 big scoops! What a great way to finish the meal and cleanse the pallet!\n\nWell done, Buddy V! Well done!"

He had an eye on everything and was always dropping in to all the tables to make sure everyone was having a good time and if anything was needed. Always managing to take away a stray glass or refill an empty one as he chatted. I asked for the appy Eggplant Parmigiana as I wasn't too hungry. When he brought it out he said \"don't get upset now but I upgraded you to the entree size, no charge, but it is just too delicious to eat just a small bit\". He was right - best ever and since my sisters took a fair bit off my plate, it worked out well. For dessert we ordered one cannoli to split. We were so full! Anyway what does he do but come out with 3 (no charge) because it would be \"terrible\" if we couldn't pick them up with our hands and  eat one each to ourselves. He was right again and they were incredibly delicious! Best host ever! Great dining experience!!!!!!"

Now here is the problem for one that does not know Las Vegas...it can be very overwhelming by the selection of dining establishments and trying to walk to / find another option than those in the casio/hotel complex you are in, can be challenging given the distances involved.  We were in the Venetian and enjoyed walking along the Grand Canal.  And we ended up at Buddy V's and very glad we did.  Unfortunately it was a Friday night and there was a 90 minute wait for a table.  There was seating in the bar / lounge area and it shares the same dinner menu, so off we went.  \n\nOrdered the $40 price fix menu which included an appy, entree, and dessert.  I selected the caesar salad, chicken parmesan and for dessert, the cannoli.  I will start with the good.  The chicken parmesan is good, really good...nicely breaded and covered with a nice tangy tomato sauce then melted cheese.  The cannoli was okay...very rich and a nice end to a dinner.  The portion size of both were quite large and one will not leave hungry.  Unfortunately there was no taste to the caesar salad dressing and the polenta croutons were simply awful...really terrible.  I had higher expectations for their caesar salad.\n\nOur server was pleasant and attentive and the food was brought out fairly promptly after each course.\n\nAll in all, it was a positive food experience and happy to recommend Buddy V's...just not their caesar salad."

Hostess staff was warm and welcoming. Started off with a nice Brunello and Caprese with burrata cheese and organic heirloom tomatoes,  accompanied with grilled Italian bread. The manager Kristina was very attentive and brought us their nicest red wine glasses for our Brunello, which we really appreciated. The Caprese was one of the best my husband and I have ever tasted. We have been blessed to spend lots of time in Italy and have had some spectacular Italian meals. Buddy V's was right up there with the best we've had in Florence, Rome and Tuscany. The pasta was perfectly al dente, prepared by Executive Chef Bryan, who we had the pleasure of meeting. We finished our meal with their spectacular cannoli's that were clearly made fresh to order based on their crunchy shell. We can't say enough about our experience at Buddy V's.....from the hostess, busboys, server, managers. This group definitely worked well together just like a big Italian family."

While the portions are appropriate, the food itself was not. My meatballs (\"grandma's meatballs\" appetizer) were great, they tasted homemade! The \"Spaghetti Bolognese\" was incredibly basic, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the spaghetti noodles were simply basic. The biggest disappointment was the cannoli. Obviously I had high expectations not only because of the price, but because of the insane hype that surrounds this restaurant, because of the fact that it is owned by Buddy Valastro and family, from the show Cake Boss, which regularly features and highlights their cannolis as a staple item. It was so incredibly stale on the outside, I had to literally smack it with my knife to knock a chunk off of it to eat, which would have been okay if it wasn't just a greasy, dried up piece of crust. The filling was sub-par as well, I'd have rather had some cool whip inside there, at least it would be somewhat pleasant. Overall, the food was poor.\n\nOur service was phenomenal, both of our waiters/ servers were very kind, fun, and knowledgeable. \n\nIf you're looking for good food, go somewhere else."

I was disappointed where they seated us, we had a seat facing the kitchen while the gorgeous view was behind us. I thought since we had a reservation& a bday to celebrate we should have been able to enjoy the view. The food definitely made up for the bad seat. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan and I ordered chicken Marsala. Both were excellent, but the chicken Marsala was the best I've ever had. Service was awesome, no complaints there.

The wait was about 20 minutes so we just grabbed a seat at the bar easily which was great, however we were pretty much ignored for 15 minutes until the bartender finally came over. My friend asked for the wine list and the way she rolled her eyes you would think that's a dumb question (is that a dumb question?). When she finally came back another 10 minutes later to get drinks I asked for a food menu and that was also apparently really labor-intensive for her because she seemed crazy annoyed. The place wasn't that busy but I could tell she was the only one behind the bar which I can sympathize -- I'm a pretty patient person so if I have to wait it's not usually a big deal as long as you're pleasant when you do get to me. So that whole exchange was sort of a bummer. \n\nAll that said the food was pretty good. Not the best Italian food I've ever had but it was straightforward pasta and good sauce. I had the rigatoni and my friend had the orecchiette and both were good enough that we finished them. \n\nWill I go back? Meh. But I am pretty excited the bakery is opening across the hall!"

But that's where the praise ends. I ordered something simple: spaghetti and meatballs. It was very...ordinary. As in \"I've had better at my junior high school cafeteria.\" Absolutely nothing to praise about the dish. I make better at home. So does the wife. So does Chef Boyardee, for that matter.\n\nThe wife ordered the veal parmesan. It was a huge hunk of meat, on the bone, pounded way too thin and then burnt under the cheese. The cook obviously put it on too high a heat and forgot it for a bit. Totally inedible.\n\nFor a place opened by a \"cake boss,\" you'd think the desserts would be exemplary. Guess again. The rum birthday cake was so-so, and the cannelloni were stale and flavorless. Again, worthless food served in a nice room with good service.\n\nSave your money and taste buds and go anywhere else for dinner. Maggiano's is just down the block and light years better tasting. Heck, go to Battista's. It's a dive that's over-rated and still better than Buddy V's. Or just stay home, heat a can of Chef Boyardee and eat it while tearing up $20 bills. In the end it's the same experience."

We started off with the Buddy's Salumi n cheese board($19) as an appetizer...nothing special for the price. Then waiter asked if we wanted garlic bread (FYI not free it was $9 for 3 pieces) bread wasn't even warm, great Italian bread is a precursor to a great meal, not even close.  Menu was limited which isn't bad bc that usually means that the stuff on the menu is usually great...Uhm not the case. The linguine n clams ($25) portion small & there was spaghetti noodles instead of linguine??? Caprese salad($14) there was a whole tomato on the plate which was like boiled n peeled, unimpressed. The angus burger had no flavor n the French fries were overdone n cold, really??? \nOk so after being disappointed by the food I was really looking forward to dessert... The XL lobster tail ($15) was so disappointing bc the pastry shell was hard as a rock n hard to eat. As you bite into it all the cream would shoot out bc the shell was so hard. The cannoli shell was hard as well, like a hard cookie ($9). If you had real cannolis you know that they are not supposed to taste like that. To top it off the coffee yes the coffee tasted horrible, like it's been sitting in the pot all day. For 3 people and sunset menu which is cheaper than dinner total $153 and that's with no alcohol..for that total there was not one thing I could say anything nice about. I had leftovers that weren't even worth taking home. \nYes, I should of known better to go to a gimmicky restaurant. But I liked the show and I'm from NYC and was hoping for some good Italiano food n dessert. No love in the food at all. Don't waste your money n time going all the way to the crazy strip for this place. \nBuddy .....if your reading this or your PR person lets you know what's going on with your restaurant. This place is giving your familia a bad name. I've had your pastries in NJ. This place is not giving your bakery any justice. People who travel to Las Vegas and who will never go to your bakery in NJ are going to think that your desserts taste like this ( specifically in the restaurant) not good."

My whole crazy Italian family would approve! Be warned the tropical drinks are very delicious but very strong. I got cockeyed 1/4 of the way drinking from my glass. I ended the evening with a cannoli which I give a 4 star because I still think my Mom's cannoli were a bit better.

We were seated and after a few minutes our server Georgio approached our table.  unbelievably upbeat and personable.  We were blown away by his descriptions of the menu items and took his recommendations wholeheartedly, and it was amazing.  His table service was incredible while making us laugh the WHOLE time!!  At the end he sang to my wife in Italian as she sat there ready to burst with tears of joy.  By far more memorable than her last birthday where we spent 3 times the amount and half the quality of food and service.  Thank you for the super memorable night Georgio and the Buddy V staff.....The Klausberg Family"

            "review": "We made it to Buddy V's at the Venetian!  Tip: Park at Palazzo Valet, walk down to strip and up escalator next to Walgreens for a shorter walk!\n\nWe came during Happy Hour, 4:30-6:30 pm 7 days a week. We were here Memorial Day weekend, and it wasn't too full on a Sunday afternoon. The seating in the bar was really comfy with stuffed chairs and couches, high top bar tables with padded seats and bar seating with padded seats with backs. \n\nWe tried one of everything on the Small Bites for $5 Happy Hour menu!!!  We also had the Butterscotch Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert for $9. So creamy and great butterscotch flavor! It's a good sized bowl, but only about 1/2 inch thick, so not as many calories!\n\nRicotta cheese was smooth and creamy. It came with grilled buttered bread, and was a great accompaniment to the Olives and Pickled Vegetables, which was served with the same bread. There was enough cheese to also put some on the amazing and Must have Grandma's Meatballs. 3 large beef, veal and pork meatballs with about 1/2 of tomato sauce, sprinkled with a good amount of parmesan cheese. Our other favorites: the Calamari had some big tender pieces that I loved, there were crispy big pieces that that the little tentacles that our friend loved and some fried banana peppers that the spicy food lover liked. My wife's favorite was definitely the Mac and Cheese Carbonara, with smoked mozzarella, fontina, egg, pancetta and peas with a creamy sauce and golden bread crumbs. We got Roma style Gnocchi, which are little fried cubes of polenta with a little metal tub of marinara mixed with pesto dipping sauce-delicious. Crunchy on outside  and smooth inside, great sauce. The smashed meatball sliders was a fun little 2 bite sandwich with peppers on top. Same for Sausage and pepper sliders, which are a bit spicy. \n\nLoved the little to go novelty light up cup for the soda with unlimited refills for $7. \n\nKrystal waited on us, and was very happy and attentive. Manager Kristina Poole visited the table and sat and visited us for a nice chat. We got an update on the restaurant, it's sister restaurant in Bethlehem, PA and Buddy's moms health when we asked. The Assistant General Manager, Sean Fiori, came and whisked her away after a quick picture and check to make sure we were happy. \n\nVery nice evening, could be quick, but this time we stayed and enjoyed ourselves and they were not pushing us out after we paid the bill.\n\nWe are here again on 12/18/16 and it's all the same-menu, Krystal the waitress, me and my wife and Flower. She's having the Sangria. No hot chocolate for Tutu, they need to add it to the menu during cold weather.  She got some across the way at Carlos Bakery. Along with Cannoli and a strawberry cheesecake."

We had the meatballs, calamari, ricotta and polenta-all delicious! The sangria was AMAZING! If I was eating on just the HH it would have received five stars!\n\nAfter HH we sat down and had dinner. The majority of the courses were excellent. I didn't like how the waiter pushed more food than was necessary. I also had the veal piccata and it wasn't that good. Eating starved baby cows only happens once a year for me and it wasn't worth it on that meal. The cheesy garlic bread was very delicious. I would definitely return for the HH but probably wouldn't eat in the main restaurant."

Although the pancetta was lacking, the cheese sauce was pure heaven and the penne pasta was cooked just right. \n\nAunt Nina's Mozzarella Corozza: It's pretty much a delicious version of the grilled cheese sandwich filled with plenty of mozzarella and pesto that is placed on a chunky bed of ragu. The only dislike I had about this appetizer was that the sandwich was drench in too much olive oil for grilling. \n\nMargherita Pizza: A simple pie that was baked to perfection with a perfect ratio of mozzarella, tomato, and basil. \n\nOverall great dining experience with delicious food to start off the day. I definitely will return and also will be saving room for dessert to try out his popular bakery, Carlo's Bakery that is located across the restaurant."

While the food was adequate, the service was non-existent.  To get anything, we had to constantly flag down staff members.  While some may accuse me of being too picky, I think the fact that the restaurant did not have fresh grated parm cheese available (they claim their wheel broke) is a major blunder for an Italian themed restaurant.  I mentioned how poor the service was to one of the floor managers on our way out, and all she could say was \"Please don't let that stop you from coming back.\"  Really?  That's it?  Spend a couple of hundred dollars on dinner only to be told that?  I think it will be long time before I head back that way.  Which is too bad because the bone-in veal parm, with our without parm cheese, is really a wonderful dish. Ironically, shortly after we were seated, a table of 10 or 11 was seated next to us.  The wait staff fawned all over those folks and the chef even came out to meet the leader of their pack.  I guess we weren't high enough rollers to get the attention that we expected."

Let me start by saying people must like this place bc of the fact that it's owner has a tv show because I was very unimpressed! \nOk, let me say that it is a beautiful restaurant but not much for a romantic evening... My husband and I were sat at a table barely large enough to hold out plates on, and we were in between 2 other larger parties! We felt completely cramped and not the least bit romantic! However we decided to try to make the best of our night and ordered some of our favorite Italian dishes! When our food arrived I wouldn't put it too far past a fast food Italian taste! There was nothing great about our food and most definitely not worth the price! We are locals who love good Italian food and there are many, and I do mean many, that we have tried off the strip who far exceed Buddy Vs! We will leave this restaurant for the tourists!"

According to our internet search for top Las Vegas restaurants for Thanksgiving dinner 2015, Buddy V's was showing a delicious menu including a squash soup to start and a main plate, all for $28/person.  When we arrived, it was $10 for soup and $29 for the main plate.  They explained that somehow, it was the 2014 menu and pricing showing online.  The soup arrived and it was way too sweet.  It should have been served as dessert, not an appetizer.  I barely had three spoonfuls and when  they took it away, they didn't even ask if it was ok.  The main course arrived and it was tasty, but cold.  We sent it back and asked for it to be hot.  When the second plate arrived 10 minutes or so later, it was still cold.  We hoped that the third time would be a charm, but it wasn't.  Half the plate was hot, half was cold.  I'm sure they must have microwaved it.  The really scary thing was that half the turkey and sausage was gone, so I'm still wondering if they served me my plate or someone else's plate.  We spent over $250 for four with a $40 bottle of wine, before tip, and were tremendously disappointed with the service, and the fact that they're incapable of serving hot food, despite several attempts.  The flavor was good, but that is not sufficient to give them our business a second time."

It seemed a little pricey at $40/person, but for what you get, it's better deal than you would think at first glance. \n\nThe complimentary bread they bring for you to dip in oil & vinegar is as a type of a focaccia, so delicious. I don't care for Balsamic vinegar, so the waitress kindly brought some marinara for me, and that sauce was perfect. I chose the panzanella side salad, which was so huge and packed with goodness. They didn't just throw some salad mix on a plate! Very fresh, croutons made in-house and packed with flavor. The cheese, the tossed-in dressing, all in perfect proportion to the greens. Also noted that they halved the grape tomatoes, which is a sign to me that they pay attention to detail. (I love the taste, but hate biting into a whole grape tomato and having it burst.) \n\nAs entree, I had the Bucatini Carbonara, which is a dish I am super picky about, and it was the best I've ever had! Pasta was perfect and I could have easily saved half, if I was a little less hungry, or it was less delicious. As it was, there was such a generous portion, I didn't finish it. \n\nMy guy had Orecchiette and Italian Sausage. It looked lovely, and had some red peppers, broccolini, roasted tomatoes, and the spicy Italian sausage. Really, all the flavors he loves. I tried a bite, and it was fantastic. \n\nThe wine  Paolo Scovino Dolcetta d'Alba 2013- was great pairing with pasta, just enough sweet and mild acidity and richness to be a wonderful accompaniment to the meal. It's a variety I hadn't tried before, so I have a new love. \n\nTiramisu was beautiful and flavorful, not too much of any of the ingredients, and a couple of lady fingers on the side. My guy finished his cannoli in about 3 minutes, as well, so I'm assuming he liked it. \n\nAll in all, Excellent! We were stuffed and happy, and the service was attentive and friendly."

Up to this visit, I openly stated that my home made lasagne was the best I have ever had, and I now have to admit that Buddy's was a bit better.  A very healthy portion that I could not finish, and the mix of cheeses, meats, pasta, spices and sauce was a true delight.\n\nThe waiter we had was great and was extremely helpful with the menu and wine choices.

We asked to sit at a booth by the window but was informed that was for guests with a party of 6 but she did seat us at another booth that was smaller. Ok no big.\n Our waiter was excellent and very prompt! His name was Chaz according to the ticket. Great service, very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. He also never let our drinks get very low because he was bringing out a fresh one which I feel is hard for other servers to do anymore. I opted for the Margherita pizza while my mom got the Shrimp Scampi. While waiting they had fresh bread that just came out of the oven and was delicious.\n Our food was great and looked good too :) they also start live music at 530 so that was a nice touch. After we were stuffed from dinner we had to look at the dessert menu because let's face it it's Buddys! The dessert menu had pictures of Buddy and his family which was a wonderful touch! We ordered Lisa's nutella cake and holy crap it was heavenly! I highly recommend it.\n\nAll in all we had a great experience and would definitely be back!"

Walking down the hall, we were met with a huge line and I hoped it wasn't a dinner rush. I suddenly second guessed my decision to gamble on a walk in. We got closer and realized the crowd was for the bake shop located directly across the hall from the restaurant. Still, there was a good amount of people in front of the host stand. Turns out, Buddy and some of the guys were there! He was near the bar that was sectioned off for a private party, but it was still pretty cool to see them there none the less!\n\nWe were seated right away and really liked the decor and vibe of the place. Caleb was our server and he pretty much made our night. He offered bottled, sparkling, or tap water to start while we looked over the menu.\n\nWe started with Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carrozza as suggested by the RJ review and also by Caleb. Be sure to order this when you come! Think fried mozzarella, but done the way it should be. The outside provided a perfect crunch and the inside had all the ooey-gooey-ness you hope to find when you get fried mozzarella. It comes dressed with a tomato sauce and pesto sauce drizzle. After our first bite, we immediately contemplated ordering another. We held off as we planned on saving room for dessert.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e ordered one of the specialty cocktails as well. I don't remember which one..it had good flavor, but the alcohol was a little strong for her liking. Caleb was attentive enough to notice she wasn't drinking it and asked a couple times if she would like him to get her something else. Being in the service industry herself and not wanting to create more hassle, she declined and figured she would drink it with her entree. Caleb came over once more and took the glass and said he wanted to get her a glass of his favorite drink on the menu. He brought back a cocktail the was tequila based and had a sprig of rosemary. My fianc\u00e9e doesn't care for tequila but I enjoyed the drink very much. We were very appreciative of Caleb's initiative to make our experience the best it could be.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e was torn between the chicken parm and the chicken rigatoni \"alla vodka\". Based on the descriptions and recommendations of our server, she went with the latter. I ordered the Agnolotti. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the sauce was very well prepared. The Agnolotti was so hearty from the flavorful meat filling and the brown butter sauce was a perfect compliment. \n\nWe somehow managed to save some room for dessert. My fianc\u00e9e has a weakness for cannolis so her decision was made fairly quickly. I came in with the intention of ordering the XL lobster tail pastry. After the meal I just had, the \"XL\" part turned me off of that idea. I was torn between the birthday cake and the Nutella cake. I turned once more to Caleb for advice trusting he would once again deliver and not turn us astray. I ended up with the Nutella cake.\n\nThe cannoli was very flavorful and had a nice touch of cinnamon. It was served with a side of chocolate sauce. The Nutella cake was actually a lava cake. It was very moist which is often lost on such a dessert. It was served with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream which perfectly balanced the sweetness of the cake.\n\nAll in all it was a great experience. The dinner menu is a little bit smaller compared to other Italian restaurants, but if every item is executed well, who cares?? Be sure to ask for Caleb and be sure to order Aunt Nina's mozzarella. I am convinced that everything on the menu is delicious and we will definitely be returning to test that theory."

The sandwich was really good. Perfectly cooked bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meat was flavorful and had a nice kick. The tomato tapenade added a nice spiciness as well. I tried some of my friend's meatballs and they were great. Moist and well-seasoned. Some of the better meatballs I've tried in town.  \n\nWe couldn't stop by without trying some dessert, so we gave in and ordered a tiramisu as well as a Nutella cake with salted caramel gelato. The tiramisu was enormous, large enough for four people to share. The Nutella cake was not overly chocolatey and wonderfully paired with the caramel gelato. I'm not typically a fan of Nutella or cake but this was the perfect combination. \n\nThey are opening a Carlo's Bakery across from Buddy V's, which will be a great addition to accompany this restaurant."

We both asked for a second piece even though we promised each other we would save room for that dessert! They offer a prix fix lunch special for $22, which is what my husband ordered. You can choose from a few slightly smaller portions of appetizers or salads, entrees or pastas, and desserts. He went with the meatballs, chicken parmesan, and cannoli. I had the whole wheat penne primavera, which included all sorts of tasty grilled veggies. My husband split his cannoli with me... I really didn't give him a choice. :p It was stuffed with sweet ricotta and dipped in chocolate chips and pistachio. Not to diss my hometown of St. Louis, known for its Italian foods and restaurants, but this was the absolute best cannoli I've ever had in my life! \n\nMy husband and I both left Buddy V's completely satisfied and determined that we would definitely return on our next trip.

The atmosphere was nice, homey touches here and there, nicely decorated, and cute touches like whisks for the light figures. My disappointment was with the food. I ordered the chicken Marsala on the advice of our server.  Unfortunately, my chicken was not properly trimmed, and had a large strip of fat on both pieces. In addition, the chicken was overcooked and chewy. (A patron at the next table had chicken rigatoni, and felt his chicken was overcooked as well). It seemed like the chicken breasts had been cooked earlier in the day and then reheated. The Marsala sauce did not have the sweet flavor you usually taste with Marsala, and tasted more like a simple brown sauce with very little flavor. The side pasta that came with the Marsala was well cooked, well seasoned, and quite tasty. My husband ordered the lasagne, as it was a \"specialty\" according to the server. The lasagne was fine, although not really any better than other Italian restaurants I have tried. It is heavy on the veal, and heavily seasoned with anise.  If you really like anise, it's definitely the lasagne for you. We ordered the famous lobster tail for dessert.  It was a very small portion for the price ($9 for a piece the size of a very small pear) and did not taste fresh. The cream filling was very good, but the pastry was very chewy and even hard to cut through.  On the plus side, the service was very good, and the focaccia before dinner was also very good.  I was just disappointed that the food was not better quality for the price."

We ordered pasta, thought the serving was too small for $28. \n\nBut you can never go wrong with their desserts. Really the best!!! Cannolis and lobster tails are scrumptious! Tried them in Vegas and New York."

We tried the calamari, meatballs, Hoboken chopped salad, carbonara, kids Mac and Cheese and pizza. For dessert we had cannoli, nutella chocolate cake and Cheese & Cake. First, the Nutella Cake is insanely amazing! Everything else was very good as well. Honestly their kids Mac and Cheese was one of all our favorites! It should be available for adults. The meatballs were prefect. Loved the flavor combination of the chopped salad but my 19 year old daughter who likes things simple, thought it was too much. The cheese & Cake, a take on cheesecake was good not super sweet but definitely not the top choice of the three we got."

Right across from it is Buddy V's bakery but didn't get a chance to try their pastries. The food was good. We ordered the calamari which is a very generous portion. It was fresh and tasty. The kids enjoyed their pizza and we ate the spaghetti bolognese. The sauce was to die for. For desert the Nutella cake with caramel salted ice cream was the finisher and we were in heaven. We went twice in 4 days. That should say something considering the options in Vegas."

            "review": "The hubs and I RARELY go out for Italian food. Why? Well, because we can make most of the dishes at home with high quality ingredients. Well, when I had some family in town, I suggested all of us going to Buddy V's only because :1. Pit stop at Carlo's Bakery; 2. It's easy for me to get back on the I-15 to head back to suburbia. 3. Italian food is always safe when entertaining guests.\nWell, my cousins decided to day drink while waiting for me to get off of work, so by dinner time, they were fighting off a massive hangover. And it wasn't even 5 PM. Then they blew us off. \nThe hubs and I decided to take advantage of our time together with our diva because we both had lobster tails from Carlo's Bakery on our mind. We figured, dinner was going to be a bonus, so I don't have to cook and clean, and we made the trek from suburbia to the Strip. \nWe checked in for our reservation and was seated within a couple of minutes. When I made the reservation, I requested a table along the windows for the view. I noticed all the tables along the windows were designed for larger parties and I was prepared for them to seat us at a smaller table since our party decreased from 6 to 3. But no, they get a high five for seating our party of 3 at the  primo table that had a view of the Strip as well as a view of Carlo's Bakery so we can keep an eye on our number. \nOur server, was personable, just a tad slow. I'll take 'a tad slow' over crappy personality any day.\nWe ordered:\nKids Margharita Pizza\nGrandma's meatballs\nCaesar salad\nChicken Parmesan\nAgnolotti\n\nI enjoyed  everything that we ordered. I thought the pizza crust was outstanding; thin, crunch AND chewy, perfect amount of sauce and cheese. The meatballs were heavenly. The Caesar salad took us by surprise. When it arrived at the table, we thought the salad looked dry. But when we took our first bite, we understood why it looked like it was dry. It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. It didn't need all that dressing because each bite had the perfect amount of acid, garlic, cheese and saltiness from the anchovies. The croutons were unique; I forgot to ask but I think it was made out of polenta. The croutons were perfect to dip with the meatballs. I had the Chicken Parmesan; it was good not great. MY hub's agnolottis were divine. Hand made, they were filled with veal shank, sausage and pork with a creamy, sage brown butter. The one complaint I had was I thought the agnolotti pastry was a tad thick but the flavors were very good. \nAll together, we spend $113 with tip for 2 adults and a princess. A tad high for a family dinner, but overall, it was a great experience for us. Too bad my cousins were too drunk. But that's what you do in Vegas."

Skipped Appetizer and Salad since we didnt want to risk getting too full for dessert. Chicken was the perfect amount of Piccata. Dessert was the star of the night with the \"Italian Birthday Cake\". I consider this the perfect dessert. Beautifully presented on a signature chocolate signed plate and pedestal. The perfect balance of not too sweet and not too rich layers of rum soaked sponge cake and cream filling. Coffee was good too. \n\nSkip Maggianos Little Italy across the street and go to Buddy V's Instead. Far better quality and flavor."

We ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, mac n cheese and Italian birthday cake. And we were very pleased with our order. The sliders tasted like what you would expect typical sausage and peppers, but tasty. Mac n cheese had chicken and veggies, which is more like a entree versus what most Americans think of it being a side dish.  Service was standard and considering we sat at the bar I've never had a bartender treat me poorly, but I must admit she was kind of awkward towards us. Lastly, the Italian birthday cake was really moist, but not dippy. I can't wait to come here again and try the Chicken Parmigiana, a customer next to us ordered this and it looked delicious. I highly recommend Buddy V's to anyone especially if you're at Venetian already."

We loved the best of course in Boston little Italy and Buddy Vs is as close as it gets.  I had the Osso Buco and my husband had the ravioli,  and both were amazing. We had to keep sharing with everybody at our table.  The only trouble we had was finding it.  It is on the second floor, but we kept asking for directions from everybody in the Venetian  and nobody could tell us.  Finally a drink server put her full tray of drinks down and went to a wall phone and got directions for us. You would think they would have training on directions in the hotel on how to get what you are looking for.  But it was definitely worth the navigating.  We will be coming back again!"

Last but not least, the cakes are insanely delicious- not surprising, seeing the restaurant is owned by the Cake Boss himself.  Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert!\n\nOur server brought us a tray of freshly baked focacia before the meal.  It was so fluffy and warm.  i could have eaten a whole tray myself!  My sister and her boyfriend shared some of their fried calamari appetizer.  It was great!\n\nThe cocktails were wonderful.  I tried my sister's martini called the Cake Boss- red velvet cake, chocolate liqueur and Bailey's.\n\nThe restaurant sadly did not offer any Alfredo entrees, which are typically my favorite, but my Chicken Piccata (breaded chicken cutlet in a white wine & butter sauce) was excellent!  The side of pasta was also very good.\n\nI tried my mom's Eggplant Parmesan and was very impressed!  The food truly tasted like we were eating a homemade dinner at a family member's dining room table.\n\nEven though we loved our meals, the best course of the meal was dessert.  I had trouble deciding what to order.  The Cannoli, Butterscotch Creme Brulee and Nutella Cake all sounded so good.  Our server recommended that I try the Italian Birthday Cake- Rum soaked sponge cake with cannoli filling, chocolate pastry cream and toasted almonds.  It was heavenly!\n\nThe restaurant's ambience is perfect for a nice family dinner.  It is beautifully decorated with a combination of vibrantly colorful kitchen items and upscale decor.  The restaurant has an energetic and happy atmosphere,  They commonly have upbeat live music playing, but at a reasonable level so you can hear the people at your table talking to you.\n\nThe service is also amazing.  The employees make you feel like old friends of theirs- definitely the ideal Italian kitchen."

The b\u00e9chamel was layered thin with a great nutty flavor the sauce was light but flavorful and the cheese was gooie with small charred bubbles that still had their crunch when it got to our table. \nI ordered the charred octopus salad OH MY GOODNESS so so so so SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!

I've been coming here for 3 years in a row for my birthday and once for our anniversary and the food has not disappointed once. \nThis is about their service. Like I stated I, with my family, having been here 3 years in a row and have received excellent service and food, until this last time in August. I originally called to reserve a table for 8 guests and a baby. I was later informed that one more person was to be added, so I called to see if I can get a bigger table. I was told I couldn't because it was a busy night for them, that maybe we could squeeze another chair, that was fine since it was for a kid. When we sat down there was so space for a car seat sling, my cousin's baby was on the floor behind her chair. The manager did not want to move us to a bigger table, which there were plenty of! The whole time we sat and ate and left there were bigger tables all around us! How is having a baby sitting in a car seat on the floor behind the chairs next to another table safe? We asked if this was a hazard or safe or a fire hazard and she kept saying no. We felt uncomfortable leaving him there (he was 2 months at the time) so my cousin had to hold him the whole time we dined. Then came time to pay. We could not do split. He la according to the waiter, the \"computer\" wouldn't let him. So we all wrote down our amounts and the card number on the back of the receipt. He then came back to say we were short. He was talking about the SUGGESTED gratuity. When then explained we would add gratuity when we signed the receipt. He said again that the \"computer\" would not let him because the total of the bill was the amount with the SUGGESTED gratuity includes. How is this even possible? My cousin tried arguing with him other wise but the waiter would not budge! He was determined to get his suggested gratuity. My cousin was getting rather upset so we budged and paid the total and walked away. Happy 30th to me! Sad to say that even though I LOVE the food here, this will no longer be my annual birthday dinner spot."

However the line was kind of long and we decided just to have an early dinner at Buddy V's cross the hall and get the deserts at the restaurant.\n\nThe hostess was courteous and the waitress was very nice. We ordered Calamari appetizer, clam linguini and mac & cheese. Linguini was al dente and kids liked the mac & cheese. But the deserts were the reason we stopped by. We ordered cannoli and lobster tail. Sure they did not disappoint, the cannoli's filling was fresh and crust was crispy. The lobster tail's skin was crunch and filling goes very well with the fresh fruits. \nThe price was the average Las Vegas casino meal price and the overall it was pretty good dining experience."

We used open table to book a reservation for 2 at 9pm about 30 min before we arrived on a Friday night but other people were walking in with no problems. Cheese Bread was good, lasagna was excellent, grilled chicken was good and Ceasar Salad was great. Other servers looked more engaged with their tables than out blonde waitress but maybe just luck of the draw. For $120 for 2 people before tip I'd rather go to Buchon."

Finally, the prices were high for what was served.  Now for more detail. \n\nMy husband and I both had salads.  I had the panzanella, which is mozzarella and grilled bread on a bed of greens.  The bread was wet and mushy.  The greens had way too much dressing.  The good news: the tomatoes and cucumbers in the salad were delicious.  \n\nMy husband got the Sicilian charred octopus. He said the octopus was nice.  The problem is, with so many outstanding restaurants close by, \"nice\" just doesn't make the grade.  \n\nSorry Buddy!"

We eventually got there and settled in for happy hour -- which lasts till 6:30 pm. Great deal -- $4 wine/proseco/sangria and $5 appetizers.  We enjoyed the calamari, meatballs, and mac n cheese (it was delicious).\n\nHeaded to the front desk at 6 pm for our dinner reservation and they assigned us a table right outside the open kitchen hub.  When I requested something quieter?  She walked me back to the bar area!  First I was a little annoyed -- why did I make a reservation if I'm still in the bar?  But turns out it was for the best, a quiet window table in the bar area with a view of the strip.  Perfect.  We were able to order another round of happy hour drinks and their pre-theater menu for $38 pp!\n\nOpting for light choices, we had the tomato soup, salmon, and cannoli.  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the cannoli was a perfect ending.\n\nBoth servers in the bar were EXCELLENT, friendly, and attentive.\n\nSadly, our only disappointment was the quality of the happy hour drinks.  The chardonnay was very dry, which is great for some people, but the big issue was the sulfites in the wines.  Really didn't enjoy the chardonnay or the proseco.\n\nOtherwise, lovely restaurant with good food and great service!"

Its always nice to walk around the Venetian, but the location of this restaurant is quite strange to me, I thought it would be at the heart of Venetian.                                         But anyway I've heard of this place through a client of mine who went to the grand opening, I watch cake boss on tv all the time and I've been curious about this place so I had to check it out for myself.So the wait time for our table on a Saturday night was only 15 minutes, our waiter was great and the amazing client service we got was from our busboy Jamal. He was very attentive,efficient, and he just paid attention to everything. He should definitely get a promotion and a raise! Ok so now the review of the food. We started with a charred octopus (recommended by our waiter)as appetizer and it was seriously delicious, I love squid so this was perfect. For our drinks we got the brooklyn ipa and prosecco which went perfect with everything we ordered.For entre\u00e8 we ordered Eggplant Parmesan with marinara pasta, Meatball Spaghetti and Garlic Bread on the side. Everything was so delicious. The garlic bread was a meal by itself. The portions here are huge, so you better go here with a huge appetite.And lastly we got the lobster tail and this was the cherry on top it was light,airy, and yummy! I'm very excited that the cake boss opened a restaurant in sin city! Now I don't have to drool all the time while watching him make amazing pastries on tv, I can just stop by Buddy V's ristorante instead! I will definitely go back because the experience and service I got was excellent."

We were there a good 20 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink orders and it went downhill from there. \n\nThe garlic bread was disgusting, and the chicken parm tasted like a frozen TV dinner. \n\nAnd that brings us to the service... Our waiter was the rudest server I have ever had. I was on a business trip and needed to have the checks split, which took him 3 tries and about 25 minutes to get right. Then, when he didn't bring me an itemized receipt (which I need for business trip expenses), I asked for one and the reaction I received was rolled eyes and gritted teeth.

They're usually over priced, and over crowded, but when I found myself at the Venetian with my wife and daughter, we swung into Buddy V's on a whim for lunch.  \n\nMy wife and I are typically appalled by kids menus because everything tends to be fried, or bathed in cheese; Buddy V's was no exception.  With that said, I ordered the kids chicken parm, however I requested the dish be with a grilled chicken breast, and no cheese. Our waitress gladly made the change, and my daughter loved the food. $12.00 for a kids meal is a little pricy, but it is the strip after all, and the food was a big hit with my daughter. I don't mind paying for quality.\n\nThe lunch menu is a little small, and I was wishing I'd looked at it before getting a table, I figured I'd just grab something with little expectation.  Big mistake! I ordered the adult chicken parm, and my wife had the chicken blt.  The pasta with the chicken parm was slightly al dente, and perfectly cooked. The chicken breading was crunchy with juicy chicken inside. \n\nMy wife was a big fan of the thin piece of chicken that came on her sandwich, and the perfectly toasted bread.  The basil was fresh and tomato not mushy, another big hit.\n\nI would have given a higher rating of not for the poor service.  Our waitress, Bethany, disappeared from our table for 20+ minutes. She took our order, and didn't come back until it we'd been finished eating for quite some time.  All in all, we'd come back for the food but the service needs some work. Out total bill was $57.62."

Hubby and I had been excited to visit Buddy V's since the construction announcement. We are big fans of Buddy's so we were curious to see what his restaurant would have to offer. \n\nThis restaurant is located in the Grand Canal Shops. I'll give you a shortcut - if you enter from the side Walgreens is on, just go upstairs and you'll see the signage. Go in through the glass doors for the shops area and you're there. No need to go through the entire casino. His bakery is right across the hall. \n\nHubby and I decided beforehand that we were going to split the Chicken Parmesan and split a Lobster Tail for dessert. We got a great seat over by the window in the main dining area. The entire restaurant is decorated really cute, and I loved the family photos. Service was attentive but only by our waiter's helper - our waiter took our order then went missing until time for the check. The assistant was great, he deserved all of the tip but I doubt it ended up that way. \n\nChicken Parmesan was huge, definitely big enough to share. We each got a chicken breast and a large portion of spaghetti so I'm glad we split it. The spaghetti sauce was amazing, I'm still dreaming about it. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Chicken was cooked nicely, no complaints about the meal at all. Our Lobster Tail was a little hard though, like it was either over cooked or a few days old. Not flakey in a good way, more like shards of hard bread. And the pastry cream tasted like whipped cream, not what I was expecting for the price. We'll definitely be back but only for the Chicken Parm. Might try a different dessert next time."

It was a bit oily, but otherwise very good. The polenta it was served with was creamy and well seasoned. I felt some vegetables/salad would have gone down nicely, but it was very good overall.\n\nThe shrimp scampi tasted very good, but the pasta seemed slightly overcooked (by maybe half a minute) and the sauce a little scarce. Flavour wise it was brilliant. \n\nThe gravy was probably the least impressive in my opinion, the sauce just needed something extra in terms of flavour to really make the meat stand out.\n\nPortion sizes were generous, originally we were keen for dessert or a visit to the cake store just opposite, but it was a bit too much. \n\nOverall it was a very good meal and one of the few decent Italian places I've been to in Vegas or anywhere else and it shows in how busy they were, but it seemed slightly let down by some small details."

These croutons were perfect, one-inch square cubes, caramelized to a perfect golden brown on the outside. Biting into one, I discovered a filling of warm polenta - also known as grits in some parts. It was apparent that these croutons had just come out of the oven, and they were HEAVENLY! I wished I could  have ordered a whole plate of them - they were that good. The rest of my experience at Buddy V's was outstanding - the main course, the service, the ambience were all great. It was those croutons, however, that brought me back for dinner the next two nights in a row.\n\nUPDATE: I stopped in for lunch on a Thursday with the family. They had a three-course lunch special. I started off with a Caesar Salad with those heavenly polenta croutons...WOW. My main course was the Chicken Parm, which was delicious.

Because I split our main courses with someone else, I got to try both the Bucatini Carbonara and the Spaghetti Bolognese. I personally preferred the Carbonara, because I thought the sauce had struck the perfect balance and the noodles were great, but the other person slightly preferred the Bolognese. Moral of the story: both were excellent. We finished with cannoli and tiramisu. Both were, as you could have guessed, fantastic. Moreover, the servers were very friendly and we felt that they paced the meal perfectly. I can't wait to go back.  However, before you do, make sure to call and ask if the prixe fixe is on the menu that day because, when we first arrived, even though it was a Thursday at noon, the waiter said that he had to check.\n\nUPDATE: I came back, and learned that we are not limited to their packaged breadsticks for lunch.

            "review": "We had a reservation there a few weeks ago and were seated right away.  Service was attentive -at first. We got our drinks, went straight to the entr\u00e9e. After that, our server wasn't very present. The chicken Marsala was pretty good; however, the pasta carbonara was very rich. My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites. Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent. Great flavor and texture. The pit of night was when our waitress, Kacey, dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom. \n  The problem there was that we were a party of 3. We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of:\n\"No gratuity has been added to your bill. For your convenience, here are some preset gratuity amounts, just circle the one you'd like to apply.\n- 15%\n- 18%\n- 20%\n- 22%\"\n\nKacey had circled the 20% option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved. After she dropped the bill, we noticed she was constantly circling our table, waiting for us to provide a method of payment. We were a party of 3 and even though we are young (early 20s) we know how to tip. It was pretty insulting. I get it, you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware of the customs. But that doesn't mean assume everybody is like that. After talking it over amongst ourselves, I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that, then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion. She tried to cover it all up by saying something like, \"Oh, that was just a suggested amount, if it's that big of a deal I can just take it off.\" And she ripped off the bottom of the check. \n  I've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior. We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths."

Since it was obvious that we were going to be seated at the bar section, Kelly reminded me that bars likely do not allow minors in their section since Katharine is only 17 so I informed the hostess. She apologized and asked us to return to the front for reassignment. For the next 10 minutes three other similar sized parties are seated ahead of us. We end up sitting in a table next to the waiters' cashier station. Not much of an issue since we were still towards the front of the restaurant. We open two of the three menus and the entr\u00e9e pages are missing. Kelly walks over to the hostess station to show them this and picks up new menus. This slight hiccup at the beginning of the evening would've been disastrous for most establishment but Buddy V's made up and bent backwards to ensure our satisfaction. GM Christopher and his manager kept checking on us to make sure we were ok. We ordered the Caprese to start and had the Shrimp Scampi, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and Spaghetti Bolognese. All fantastic! We finished with the Apple Pie topped with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. They do a really good job with their food. If you ever get the chance to visit one of their restaurants, it is well worth it!"

When we were to be seated, the hostess tried to sit us right opposite the open kitchen, which is brightly lit, noisy, steamy and certainly not where we wanted to be. She then went back to see where else we sit and we got a table for 2 in the bar. The food was good. Foccacia was warm and they offered oil and vinegar as well as butter. We found the service was fast, maybe a bit too fast.  Maybe Saturday night is a busy one,and they try to move their diners along. We had the beef medallion, $38, cooked a little too rare for medium, but it was tasty. The mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach that it was placed on, could have been a bit more generous. Very skimpy on those portions. We also had the price fixed dinner for $38, which gave you choices. We had: Grandma's meatballs, chicken parm with spaghetti and they were tasty but they skimped on the sauce so although it was good, it could have been better. The chicken parm was very crispy and tender but the spaghetti was a bit dry. The meatballs had a nice portion of sauce served with them, so we should have kept that dish, just for the leftover sauce. The desserts you could choose was a cannoli or a Nutella cake with salted carmel ice cream.  Nah...didn't appeal to us, but we were told you couldn't substitute from that menu.  Really?  I can understand the entrees but the desserts? We were told that they had a 'full dessert menu' but our waitress never offered to show it to us. Carlo's Bakery is right across the hall from the restaurant, but by the time our meal was done, so were we. There was quite a long line waiting to get into the bakery, and it wasn't moving very quickly.  What we did notice, was that when you go to sit at the bar, there are 2 steps up, and there is no handrail in the middle of this wide expanse. We saw two patrons stumble, and one of the waiters actually took a flat out fall. We may go back to give Buddy V's another try and since we now know the lay of the land, so to speak, we will be specific about where we want to be seated, and will order with a request for \"additional sauce on the side\". I'm from Jersey City NJ originally, so come on, Buddy, take a little constructive criticism to heart, from a neighbor who loves ya'!  :-)"

The hostess grabbed a towel and wiped it off but not entirely.  Still sticky and gross. We ignored that but the wobbly table was obnoxious. The server came over and ignored the garbage at her feet so I pointed it out and asked for something to even out the table. The busser brought by our share plates and mine had a nice long hair attached to it under my napkin. We ordered the garlic bread and meatballs. The garlic bread wad just that. Simple, not exciting, garlic bread, and the meatballs were very dence. We are both Italians and they weren't the soft flavorful moist meatballs we were use to. Just dence and dry. The sauce wasn't memorable either. The wine was fine, but we were just kind of turned off by then. I asked for the bill and got the wrong one. All together I really don't think we'd be back."

Husband had chicken parm said it was good and had lots of flavors going on as well. Chicken was not dry. Had the Caesar salad was saving room for dessert. Salad was good and just the right amount. Desserts are awesome. Must have is the tiramisu the lady fingers are on the side and you dip them in the mason jar of stuff.

This is the first time I have stopped by in years after claiming they have the best tiramisu. It was so HUGE. And now.....it comes in a mini mason jar. \n\nI understand businesses have to make money, but some dishes and desserts have become painfully small and remained at expensive prices, which is just plain sad. \n\nFurthermore, they try to trick you into paying for water now. Instead of offering tap water like they used to, they get rid of the option in their speech. \n--SO if you DON'T want to pay for nestle water, and they say \"Still or Sparkling?\"...SAY TAP. Don't pay for water unless you really want to. Because that is just a damn waste of $10 folks. \n\nThey never used to trick me before, so I was totally not expecting this. I can't even rate them like I normally do, because I was so mad. \n\nThe big points are: \n1) Their food is just average, so just skip it. \n2) The dessert is the better part of the meal, so if you want some, just go to Carlo's Bakery. \n3) They do have really good service, but they tricked me, so that was a little messed up since they didn't used to do that. It's totally what you expect restaurants that serve $80 per head to do. If you're going to do that, can't you at least do it during the more expensive dinner time?\n\nI'm pretty mad, so it'll be a while when I come back, if ever."

For $38.00 you can get a fixed price meal of an appetizer, entree and desert.  I had the Grandma's meatballs which were incredible, light fluffy balls of flavor in a red sauce; a pasta dish consisting of Bucatini, a thin tube spaghetti with pancetta black pepper and egg(this was my favorite dish of the night and is worth going back for more), and closed the night with nutella cake which was delicious.

Astounding and personable, funny stories were shared between him and all my clients and he single handedly made the night... one of my potential clients enjoyed the evening so much he whispered on the way out that anybody that has great taste in dining establishments like Buddy Vs is someone he can see himself in business with.. THANKS GIORGIO!!!!!!!! See you next time in Vegas for sure!! A must visit!"

This place was honestly not the first place we had picked to go for dinner that day, but some how we ended up there and we were not disappointed! The service to begin with is AMAZING. Our server told us that one lasagne would be good for the 3 of us, but we were being naive and didn't want to believe it. So we got 3 lasagnes, because of the high praise from the other staff as well. Our server was not joking, that lasagne is one plate you might never finish in one sitting. All three of us finished only about a quarter of our lasagnes before we were stuffed to our eye balls. We literally couldn't move. But it was so delicious, form the sauce to the meat and the cheese! They also make fantastic drinks and offer great insight on the various dishes. The restaurant offers great views, and even though we didn't get to try it, we heard the high praise of their cheese cake!\n\nTLDR: Get one lasagne for 3 people, you will all be stuffed!"

Their Bruch buffet features high quality breakfast and lunch dishes, fresh premium fruits, cheese, Italian cold cuts and best of all: the desert bar. The service has always been good and the overall value is reasonable for a major resort Strip front restaurant. \nToday I came for regular lunch. We ordered the salami and cheese platter, spaghetti Bolognese and tiramisu. As always, the food was outstanding. The three cheeses and three meats were of the finest quality and paired with freshly open-fire grilled garlic butter feloni bread. The Bolognese, while a simple dish, has always been one of our favorites here, as they do it perfectly. Saving the best for last, the tiramisu by itself is worth coming here for (and it's served as part of the Sunday brunch buffet as well !!). I also loved their new coffee from Fonte, which is a perfect pair with the tiramisu. \nThe weeks before Christmas are always slow, so we were able to get a table by the window with excellent Strip view. Danny did an outstanding job taking care of us and making this a truly enjoyable lunch at one of my favorite restaurants."

It's not necessarily a romantic atmosphere but that's just Vegas in general. Doesn't matter where you go, there's always someone in shorts and a crappy t-shirt and flip-flops. Having said that, we still managed to have enjoy a nice romantic evening. The waiter was great. The chicken parm was great, the corozza was great, the lobster tails and Italian birthday cake were of course great. And just because I needed to try the tiramisu, we came back a few days later. And of course, that was great too. Nice touch with a little bit of chocolate cake in the bottom. I liked that the place wasn't overly crowded and we could go and sit down pretty much whenever. It was certainly one of the highpoints of our trip and I very much look forward to going back. And next time, I'll look forward to stopping into the Carlos Bakery shop opening up just next door. I know some complained about the pricing. I would argue that once again, that's just Vegas. Cocktails cost pretty much $14 wherever you go, unless you're sitting at the slots, and restaurant food is pretty much always $20+ for entrees. That's just the way it is."

I'm a huge fan who occasionally watches episodes of Cake Boss and dreams about going to Hoboken to taste his food.  So when I heard about Buddy V's Ristorante during this recent birthday trip, my heart skipped a beat and I told my husband we HAD TO go!\n\nFrom the outside, the charming decor mimicked that of a quaint cafe nestled in the corner of somewhere in Italy (or so I'd think, since I've never been).  It drew me in!  I love how it felt homey yet upscale inside.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Our food took a while to arrive but the taste more than made up for it!  I ordered Nonna's Lasagna.  Oh my!  It was as if I've never had lasagna before!  There were so many layers with meat and cheese that just melt on your tongue.  That good!  I wished my stomach were bigger just so I could have more of that lasagne.  It was a very generously portioned dish.  My husband ordered Mama's Style Chicken.  He loved his dish too!  \n\nOh and don't get me started on the dessert!  Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake was perfect for my birthday treat - chocolate cake drizzled in chocolate sauce with caramel ice cream.  Scrumptious, to say the least!  They decorated with \"happy birthday\" and our server sang to me in Italian.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nThe customer service was amazing.  Our server was funny and accommodating.  We had our baby with us and enjoyed a memorable dinner out.  What more could you ask for in Vegas?!  Definitely one for the books!"

We arrived early and had drinks then were ready to move to dinner but the bar made a huge thing of needing to close out our tab there first (3 drinks, one of which was a happy hour drink, so not a big tab!). Okay that's fine but then it took forever to get the waitress to come so we could close out. Not good.... and then at our table the waiter was very nice (Rocko) but not very efficient nor was his helper. We had to ask for olive oil and vinegar for the bread and they brought one for the table of 6 so we asked for another and never got it. Later in the evening we asked for two decaff coffees and those never came. \n\nWe were not in a hurry so it was fine but they need to look into these issues.

On my second visit I did the Bloody Mary bar, which was excellent and I was pleased to learn that I could choose from other alcoholic drinks as part of my $15 all you can drink price.

Later the manager came asking the same questions and promising another salad; to which I told him no since I didn't want start on salad while my party is on their main entr\u00e9e'. I was hoping the food would be good, but no.. The pasta was not fully cooked, hard to chew, dry and only 3 shrimps!!! For a $30 entr\u00e9e' I was expecting some good.  But no! This place is over rated; like many other things in Vegas."

My nephew had macaroni and cheese and it was the best I've ever had. Service was even better. The view is just incredible of the strip and I loved the big windows with natural sunlight coming in.

We were on a Girls Trip to Vegas, each celebrating something different but together and wanted to dress up for a ladies night out. We were able to get a reservation same day, the wait was so short once we got there and we were able to get some great group shots thanks to some other guests. We got an amazing window booth that over looked the strip and could see the gondolas below - it was not too loud and had a great vibe. \n\nOur waiter Chaz - was amazing! Quick and efficient, he recommended his favorites and we took his advice - food was perfect and portions were definitely Italian Style!\nShare plates so you can try a little of everything! and still have room for Buddy V's award winning desserts."

Had a very nice bus boy but the waiter was creepy and a little scary. The chicken parm was good, pasta was a little on the creamy side.

I wanted more bread! He poured some oil and vinegar for us (a lot of it) and gave us 1 piece of bread for it. That's ok I made up for it by eating all the bread stick thingys that are in the cups on the table. \n\nBuddy's Salumi and Cheese Board: damn yo this was real good. I didn't care for the olives but I'm not a fan of them anyway. The meats and cheeses I could have ate all day.\n\nOrecchiette and Italian Sausage: This dish had sausage in its name so I ordered it. It was not as heavy as a spaghetti with sauce which was nice. I ate every bite and would order it again. \n\nSpaghetti Bolognese: I was very surprised to like this. When it came out I expected some sort of red sauce on it but that wasn't the case. My wife took a bite and really liked the taste too. Winner winner bolognese dinner!\n\nLisa's Warm Nutella Cake: Came with salted caramel ice cream. This was hot and good and everyone should order it. \n\nZeppole: I guess a spiced sugar is outside of these but I didn't taste anything but fried dough. I didn't like this."

Yes, I realize they are famous for desserts with Carlo's Bakery across the hall but I had 2/3 of my meal boxed up because of the generous portions, we were stuffed! I hope they split the tips with the assistants because she was awful and the young man took very good care of us the entire meal, even my hubby commented several times about her demeanor and expressed that he wished the assistant was our actual server."

The fact they had a program to do so was great to hear, and it did not disappoint.\n\nThe food was amazing. Exceeded all of our expectations. We had a great spread that really covered all the bases from the menu. One dish was better than the next.\n\nThe waiter, Georgio, was the best in the business. I've eaten at great restaurants around the world and had great service but he was truly world class and made the night. He was funny and entertaining but did not overdue it. Sometimes you get a funny or personable waiter who you like but they are too busy chatting they forget a request or get distracted, but not Georgio. He even sang happy birthday to my mother in Italian which really was the icing on the cake. \n\nIt was a night to remember, thank you to Buddy V's for making it special!"

But hey...it's located in a 5 diamond hotel right ON THE STRIP...what else can you expect?\n\nTo sum it up, everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great, our waiter was attentive the entire time keeping our drinks filled, napkins/utensils were delivered quick. \nWe got an order of their famous meatballs as an appetizer. I believe it came with six. Perfect to start off with. The meatballs were very flavorful and they weren't puny little meatballs either.\nFor our entrees, I ordered chicken Parmesan and my date ordered a pasta dish. Let me tell you, like most restaurants here on the strip, portions were pretty big. I definitely had leftovers for the next day. My chicken Parmesan wasn't dried and they put the perfect amount of melted cheese on top. \nWe also ordered dessert. Not a big fan of sweets to begin with and I was already full from dinner. But my date suggested we share something soooo....sure, why not? We ordered the canoli and it was wayyy toooo sweet for my liking. The cream filling....bleh....over powering. I much prefer a gelato or something if I ever get a chance to come back here.\n\nOverall, this is a really good restaurant and I can see it thriving here at The Palazzo. Prices aren't as expensive as say, Dal Toro or Bouchon. If you're in the mood for Italian and kind of on a budget.....I definitely recommend Buddy V's.\n\n(P.S.) Heard Buddy V is going to open up a bakery shop at the Venetian sometime in March 2014. Stay tuned!"

The restaurant is located in the Canal Shoppes which is one of our favorite haunts while visiting.\n\nWhat always blows me away is the line across from the restaurant for his bakery, it usually is formed at least halfway down the corridor.  All I can say is the bakery must be delish....but I digress.\n\nWe only had to wait 10 minutes for a table at lunch which you can sit in the bar or wait in the corridor.  We were seated in the bar area.  The best way to describe the vibe here is casual chic.  The restaurant feels very open yet has a Brooklyn restaurant feel to it.  Servers are dressed casually and make you feel very comfortable.\n\nI would have liked the server to be a little more friendly...don't get me wrong she was very efficient...just didn't seem happy to be there.  However she gave us great service and everyone has those days so it did not take away from the experience.\n\nI had the eggplant parmesan  which was HUGE and delicious.  No way I could eat it all or even half of it...but I sure did enjoy trying.  Hubby had the spaghetti and loved it.  The cheese garlic bread is like an entree on its own...perfectly toasted with yummy gooey cheese.We both enjoyed the menu as all of the entrees have special ties to the owner like My Wife's Eggplant Parmesan or Lisa V's Linguine, this just gives you the feeling of being in an Italian grandmas kitchen.\n\nHubby ordered a Buddy V's lobster tail for dessert and I can tell you they look just like they do on his tv show...big and stuffed full of tasty goodness.  I only had a bite as i was still trying to tackle the eggplant parm but it was magnificent.\n\nThis is definitely going to become a lunch tradition when we are in Vegas.  Great food at reasonable prices"

The food is Great and the service is excellent.  Our waitress yesterday was I believe Graciela and she did an excellent 5 star job !  Nuggs had the classic cheese pizza.. of course.. and although the presentation was nice the sauce tasted like it was straight from the can (in my opinion).  It did not compliment the pizza at all and I could only compare it to what would seem like Hunts canned tomato sauce accompanied with good pizza dough and cheese.  My friend had the Chicken Parm , and I had the Bucatini Carbonara which I hoped I spelled correctly.  Definitely NO complaints on those two dishes!  I would definitely try those if you are not sure what to get.  Cheesy Goodness accompanied with the subtle flavor of bacon and texture of what seemed to be bread crumbs in the Bucatini are going to have me coming back in July for a double order!  Super deliciousness! My only sadness is that for 23.00 nugget stole most of it from me and there wasn't enough for me.  It's a portion size designed for an average person I would imagine but being that I'm on the bit larger side of the spectrum I could have eaten two plates easily.  Chicken Parm with spaghetti was demolished by my friend so I would imagine that should tell you how good it was.  The Cheese board is also a good add to your list of things to get while you are here.  Great selection of meats and cheeses but the bread was not enough for the amount on the board.\nDesserts I might have to say are phenomenal !  I would have to say a best choice would be the Nutella cake and ice cream.  I say this only because after our meal the nugget had finished most of her pizza and half of my pasta so when I asked her if she wanted a dessert she replied NO.  I received my nutella cake and after having one bite I asked her again .. Are you sure?  It's nutella cake.. and the result about dessert is in my picture for this place."

No longer hungry, but not particularly impressed.\n\nWe had the panzanella, turkey dinner, linguine and clams, cannolis and apple crostata. The panzanella was good, but we wished there was more than the four small slices of cheese on it. The turkey dinner was good. Was it $24 good? Not so sure. The linguine and clams was somewhat overpowering with the spices. Is linguine and clams supposed to make you sweat? Apple crostata was pretty darn tasty. Easily the highlight of our meal. The cannolis? Seeing as how the cannolis are seemingly a signature type thing, you'd think they would wow. They didn't wow us. They're good cannolis for a Hoboken bakery. But for a $$$ restaurant in the Venetian? For $$$ it needs to be BETTER than \"home cooking\"."

Well, it wasn't the Venetian, where I was lucky enough to park and walk from. Grrrr!  After getting the waiter to confirm, use the Palazzo Valet, but it's still a little trek. \n\nThe waiter was super friendly and nice, even when I returned my soda, because it had a funny smell. I promise it wasn't me...I made half the table confirm it smelled bad. \n\nI asked the waiter what was good and he said many things. I mentioned the chicken parm, because so many people on yelp ordered it, and he said that was a good option. So I went for it.  Buyers remorse!!  It was decent, don't get me wrong, but the guy across from me got a burger that looked amazing!!!  Who would have thunk it...a burger at an Italin joint?!  Next time!\n\nThe parm was ok, and most would probably love it, but I am super picky about my sauce, being raised in an Italian pasta sauce making family. It did have two big pieces of chicken, fried well, and not dry with ample cheese on top. I wouldn't throw it away, but it wasn't OMG, I am ordering this again.  I already know I will be ordering the burger next time. :P\n\nI also wish I had room for the lobster tail dessert, but I just don't. :(\n\nI would come back again, because I think this place could make me happy.  Just not a good start with the strange soda this time."

It took us forever to find the restaurant. It's not well signed. When we got there a nice lady took us to our table. We waited quite awhile to be noticed. Finally a snoody server came over. He tried to upsell us bottled water. We declined. Of course I didn't order the burger. Instead I had the smashed meatball sandwich. It came on a crisp french roll. It also had ricotta cheese on it. That just ruined it for me. The meatballs were dry and very little sauce. All I could taste was the ricotta. It came with french fries that were nothing spectacular. My friend had the vodka rigatoni. He said it was very good. It should have been for $23.00!! That was the lunch price. I think this place is over priced and to snoody for me. I would have much rather gone across the street to Mangiano's. I never have a bad meal there. No, I won't be back and won't recommend it."

The salad and bread selection even featured a traditional hot cross buns. Carved meat station had slab bacon along with an incredibly tender leg of lamb. The pastas and meatballs were an excellent nod to the Italian side and made me want to go back for dinner. My kids favorite item was the French toast. The cake boss did not disappoint for the dessert. Individual tiramisu was perhaps the best I ever had and the mini cannoli's had very flavorful filling but we're probably made a bit too early and the shells were already a bit soggy. Unfortunately the only downside to our meal was the grumpy servers and unfriendly host staff. It is a family atmosphere place and they all acted annoyed to be serving children. A pleasant attitude and a smile goes a long way to make you feel welcome. Overall we are glad we picked Buddy V's to celebrate Easter at. As locals we will most likely be back."

            "review": "First off - the food was good.  I recommend the Mac & Cheese.  It all went sideways from there.\n\nA group of us decided to give it a try last week.  We got right in and the service was fast.  The server knew nothing about where she worked nor any details about the cake boss himself or the famous bakery across the hall.  We informed her as to who Buddy is.  Bad start for this employee we thought.\n\nLater that night we decided to give the bakery a try and experience the famous treats we had only seen on the TV show.  We waited in the long line and ordered our treats.  After we paid, I heard some construction noise and realized that a construction person was knocking bricks off the wall some 15 feet behind us.  In fact the debris actually hit one of our guests.  In the small bakery their is a small bar to sit at, but in this case that was even closer to the construction guy.  We asked the cashier if we could sit across the hall at the Buddy V's to enjoy our treats.  She said ok but to inform the host.\n\nWe crossed the hall and asked the host if we could sit in the dining area that was in the hall, she said no that area was closed.  The restaurant was near empty and I clearly pointed out the construction mess as it was only 30 feet across the hall.  I then asked if we could sit anywhere inside to eat our already paid for treats.  She said no, I should go eat it at the bar inside the bakery.  Needless to say we left and found some tables out in the mall.  \n\nI can not believe that the same establishment from across I the hall would treat people so negatively.  I will not return given their lack of service.  Too bad, the food was pretty good.  They really need some training as to who they work for as well as the true value of a customer.  I will never go back for that reason."

One, the bakery across the hallway is over the top and smells addicting. Two, there is a kid's menu, but I have a feeling, Buddy V's Ristorante would not be good for kids in the later hours of the day. Lunch or early dinner, sure. \n\nGreat Place. Great Service.

I have been to the best places in Vegas and some are over hyped and some under hyped. I went into Buddy V's not really thinking anything was gonna be all that amazing but I was wrong on a few things.\n\nOne, The mussels they have are the best mussels I have ever eaten in my life. The mussels were so good I ordered another order after dessert.\n\nTwo, The surf and turf I ordered was cooked to perfection.\n\nThree, The XL Lobster dessert is probably one of the most amazing things on this planet.\n\nI love to watch new restaurants as they open just to see who really has their shit together and I think Buddy V's did a pretty good job on their opening. Staff was nervous and If I worked there I would be too. Not only is it opening day but the owner, owners business partners and the owners parents are all there. \n\nWe were greeted by Adam Margolies who is the asst G.M. and it was really great to talk to a guy who is really into the property enough to where he had an answer for every question. I know to people reading this that may not seem like much but being from Vegas it is really hard to find knowledgeable people that know things even at the places were they work. We asked him how the XL lobster is made, where the cuts of beef were farmed from, if the scallops are flown in or driven, if the broccoli is organic, if the chocolate chips in the Gelato was made from scratch or store bought. \nWe asked all these questions and he answered all of them with no hesitation. \n\nThe decor is 10/10 for the type of restaurant it is and I think it will do well here in Las Vegas. I love eating at places that don't feel stuffy as I don't believe you should ever feel uncomfortable anywhere in Las Vegas.\n\nWelcome to Vegas Buddy V!! Your gonna do great here and we are glad you chose Vegas to serve. Gonna get more mussels now !"

When the bill comes the Stella Beer was $16. I inquired on why so much and they said because you keep the glass. I said we wanted the beer with no glass and they said that's the only option. The bus boy came around to clear off the table and he said they do have a smaller 12oz version without the stupid souvenir glass for which we weren't given the option.\n\nThen for dinner my daughter asked for a white pasta instead of the kids spaghetti. Waiter said he could do a kids Alfredo. Come the bill was a charge for a $20 Alfredo when the other kids entrees were $12. We had to ask the manager which quickly took care of the problem.\n\nI personally ordered a Caesar salad and as the waiter walked away he said he would being enough to share. Bill comes and were being billed for a huge family portion for which 2 people ate and more than half was left.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered was too sweet and liquor.

I'm a Cake Boss fanatic and have stood in line for hours to get in to Carlos Bakery in Hoboken when it was the only location, so Buddy V's was a no brainer. \n\nA long line outside the bakery across the hallway, but no wait for the restaurant, possibly just because it was FILLED with exhaust/smoke. They assured us it was not normally that way and let us pick our table in the least-smoky area of the restaurant, which overall got better as we went. Not sure what the issue was.\n\nThe octopus salad was super small, so I was glad I wasn't that hungry. More so, the octopus smelled like tuna in a can. I've never had octopus that smelled bad, and almost didn't eat it, but took a chance. The special Cake Boss dessert cocktail was strong, gross, and the red velvet crumbs on top weren't even red. \n\nThere are two cakes on the dessert menu, and we got both. The chocolate cake was underwhelming, but the Italian Birthday Cake.... oh my gosh amazing. Is this really what Italian Birthday Cake is like? We have been DOING. IT. WRONG. Chocolate ganache filling AND cannoli filling, covered with mounds of fresh whipped cream, sliced almonds. Definitely Top 5-10 desserts of my life.\n\nOur waiter Charlie was very nice, but he was overbooked it seemed as it took 12 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and we often waited and waited just to have someone walk by so we could grab their attention. I also asked him 3 separate times to bring the check before he did. \n\nIt all felt extremely, extremely overpriced, too. $100 for 2 entrees, a cocktail, and 2 desserts, that mostly were not very good? Meh. \n\nPro-tip to you people standing in line at the bakery: if the dessert you're planning on ordering there is on the Buddy V's restaurant dessert menu... why are you waiting? Order it here. (But skip the food.)"

We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.\n\nWe got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.\n\nFor our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.\n\nI got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.\n\nFor dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.\n\nOur server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.  They have a shade which was partially lowered but it should have been lowered more or we should have changed our seating position at the table so our backs were toward the sign.\n\nA very pleasant evening in a really good restaurant!"

No shame here. \n\nMy kids enjoyed the oven baked Mac & Cheese gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside & the gourmet burger on freshly baked brioche bread with aioli and side of fries. Happy campers with full bellies! \n\nOf course being so full we had to take our cannoli to go. It looked so darn good that to my surprise tasted even better than I imagined. We ordered the chocolate chip and pistachio nut toppings. The cannoli stayed crispy/flaky even after eating it hours later. The cream and chocolate sauce was sheer perfection.  Definite must! \n\nA casual, hearty establishment for the entire family.  Bundt cake molds for wall decor as well as kitchen utensil inspired lighting and fixtures.  Booth seats overlook the Vegas strip. Since lunch was a hit, I would definitely come back here and check out their dinner menu."

Cheap in price ($34.95 per perosn), but not in quality that is. The food was delicious and there was such a good variety of Italian food, breakfast food, seafood, desserts & fruit. Not to mention, it wasn't your typically fruit you find in your local market. The garlic cheese bread was Heaven! The pasta dishes were great as well. The seafood was fresh and great quality. Honestly, I'm not a big fan on buffet's but this was a great way to try out several of the dishes at this restaurant. ALSO...The pianist really added to the ambiance of the place. We will definitely go back again."

Buddy Valastro's Italian accent makes my heart skip a beat, and the delicious dishes he's serving up at his self-named restaurant in Vegas will do the very same!\n\nWork trip.  Boooo.  But in Vegas? Hell yeah.  I stayed at the monumental Venetian hotel and had the most luxurious suite of suites.  It was late.  I was tired.  I was hungry, and to make matters worse, I was indecisive of what to eat. (Don't you hate that feeling?)  One of my suppliers suggested grabbing a bite at a place called Buddy V's.  \"Oh like Eddie V's brother?\" I asked.  \"Nooo.  Buddy V's as in Buddy Valastro.  The Cake Boss,\" she replied. Ahhh.  How did I not know this?  \n\nWe grabbed a table towards the back, and I acquired the perfect view.  It was about 10PM and I was facing the Las Vegas Strip--the beaming lights shining down on the commotion of pedestrians as they scurried towards the various hotels and casinos.  For my first time in Vegas, this, ladies and gentlemen, was a sight!  \n\nI gulped down the most delicious glass of cab, and ordered the spaghetti carbonara and added Italian sausage, per the waiter's suggestion.  It used to frustrate me watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives because every other episode, Guy Fieri exclaims \"this is the best ________ I've ever had!\"  When you say that about every dish, what makes one different from the other? Driving my point home, the Spaghetti Carbonara at Buddy V's Ristorante was THE BEST PASTA DISH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! And I'm not Guy Fieri-ing you.  The pasta is obviously made in-house, and that sauce is ridiculously rich and creamy.  The Italian sausage just drove the dish right on home for me.\n\nBuddy V's is... Simply put? OUT OF BOUNDS, and I can't wait to get back to Vegas and eat there again and again!"

The food in this place tasted like home in Brooklyn in my mother in laws kitchen. The restaurant is in a wing of the Venetian and across the way from it, is Carlo's Bakery. (You can easily access the restaurant from outside the Venetain. Its above the Walgreens close to the Deuce stop. Almost like you are leaving the Ventian and walking towards Palazzo). The restaurant was very pretty with gorgeous views. The vibe is very causual, laid back, like you stopped by a friends house. Any clothing goes. No dress code. Not at all stuffy and pretentious like Giadas. (see review). We had a friend with us from Texas who had never had NY Italian food, so we had to take her there and see if it was authentic. Authentic it was. We started out with the mozzerella and Carozz that was amazing. I got the \"Sunday Gravy\"- which is exactly how we make it here. You get a bowl of pasta, with a seperate skillet of red meat sauce with meatballs (OMG delish), pork shoulder, lamb. My husband had pasta bolongese. Insanely good. My Texas friend had the lasagne. It was huge and she ate it for 3 days. All portions were big. The food was not pricey. The dessert menu comes in what looks like an old photo album, and it contains pics of a young Buddy and family with his dad, and then pics of him with his own kids. The whole place is decorated in family pictiures in frames on the walls. For dessert, we had the Nutella (yes Nutella) Lava cake!! OMG. Melted Nutella runs out of the center of this lava cake served with Salted Caramel ice cream. There are no words. Get yourself there  ASAP. You will not be sorry. It was so good, we went twice during out 10 day stay. Had to go back for lunch and got more meatballs, eggplant parm and 2 amazing salads. My new fav place in Vegas. Buddy needs to franchise these places out across the country. I hear Buddy is there monthly. Sadly he was there as soon as we got home to Nyc. Cant wait to go back."

It was awesome to see the cooks say \"yes chef!\" Decoration had whisk, bundt pans, and rolling pins hanging off the ceilings. Cool! Yelpers said the portions are big so bf and I decided to share. No splitting fee. We got the calamari and chicken Parm. The focaccia bread was warm, soft, and perfect. The dipping was olive oil & balsamic vinegar. It was well balanced. Our order was taking soo long. Then our waiter came back with the wrong order for our appetizer. He was so confused. We were confused. He goes back to the kitchen and we hear the head chef get angry and started to yell at the waiter. The manager comes to our table apologize and pays for our appetizer. Great service!! Finally our appetizer arrived! Our calamari was perfect. Lightly battered, soft, and the sauce was great! It wasn't chewy! I hate chewy calamari! Our entree chicken parm was perfect as well. Well seasoned, lightly battered, juicy, thin, and huge!! No room for dessert this time.Next time we will come back and try the dessert too!"

To start the lobster tail (dessert) could make a grown man cry of joy, I literally would have been happy to stick a straw in it and suck out all the cream out instead of actually ordering a meal (Which is what I did the following day, pretty sure i gained about 10lbs just off of lobster tail filling)\n\nEnough about the dessert (I'll be talking more about it more when I write my Carlos Bakery review, yes it was that good!) The entrees are not something to overlook either. Let me start out by saying I am a somewhat food snob when it comes to classier restaurant. While I have left some places questioning the quality based on what I paid this is certainly not one of those times. As far as Italian food goes it doesn't get much better, the quality is spectacular and there is nothing that I would have changed. To top it off the portions were HUGE! Being a guy in his early 20's of course I forced myself to eat every bite. However most people would have probably took half of it to go.\n\nIf you are ever in Las Vegas do yourself a favor and stop by Buddy V's for dinner."

I'm so glad that I went to his restaurant at Las Vegas it was once in a life time experience and the first time is always the best."

There was nothing typical about the fabulous offerings. \n\nFirst the all you can drink package included way more variety than what you usually get at a \"champagne brunch\". The options included certain wine, beer, bloody marys, mimosas, sangria AND bellinis. We ended up trying almost everything and I can't say a bad word about any of it. The fruit was so fresh and delicious in the sangria and the red wine and champagne were top quality. \n\n The service was prompt and the waiters and bussers were extremely attentive. Our glasses were never empty, our table was never dirty. The staff was also helpful in making sure we knew where everything was and offered suggestions on the food and drinks. \n\nSpeaking of food... The first thing I noticed was that the food was put out in small batches to keep everything fresh. You could really taste the freshness. The Italian offerings were obviously great and I couldn't believe the antipasto area. Everything was so delicious from the fresh, perfectly cooked shrimp to the very flavorful meatballs. I barely left room for dessert. I was able to take one little bite of most things and well... there are no words!\n\nI can't wait to go back"

We had made reservations for 8pm for 7 and by the time that came around we still had to wait half an hour for them to clear the table and what not. After being seated we were giving menu and drink menu. Everything sounded really good and look delicious! I order the madiline penne and my friends all ordered something different. The food came out fairly quick, but it seemed like our waiter kept on forgetting what we had. The service was okay, but it was as they were almost rude. The food was also okay it wasn't as expected. I've actually had better! So overall buddy v is just hype because of the TV show. At this point it was an experience and that it's really up to you if you'd like to try it out.

Learn something new everyday!\n\nOur party of 8 came here around 10:30pm on a Sunday evening. We got seated quickly, even with our big party. None of us were very hungry, so we ordered all appetizers or small dishes and a couple of drinks. \n\nMy boyfriend and I shared a Margherita Pizza (definitely big enough for two -- has about 8 small pieces). Both my boyfriend and I agreed that the pizza was really tasty! We happily ate the whole thing. It was cooked just right and was hot and steamy when it got to our table. Just the way I like it! I also ordered a Salad...I don't remember the name of it, but it was decent sized and tasted fresh. I was so full on pizza, I couldn't eat my whole salad. I definitely could have just done one or the other. \n\nI don't remember what the rest of my party ordered. There was a variety of dishes, but they all must have been good because I don't remember anything left on anyone's plate when we were done. This means the food was delicious! Or else we were all just hungry. Either way, it was good overall. \n\nService was great. Our server was friendly and personable. I like that when it comes to servers!\n\nMy only gripe was that our food took forever to come out. We waited a good 15+ minutes before anything came out. That was a long time considering they weren't that crowded or busy when we were there. They may need to work out some kinks in the kitchen. \n\nOn a side note, this restaurant has good views of the strip. I really liked that, and I spent awhile gazing out at the bright lights and the busyness of the strip. Good people watching!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time at Buddy V's. I would definitely come back here again on another visit to Vegas!\n\nCheers!"

Enough with the names and prices to go with it. We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it. \n\nThere was a wait at 8pm on a Sunday night, so reservations help. We were told the wait would be an hour. We made reservations on-line and only waited 25 minuets! \n\nThe decor is nice-- the ceiling light fixtures are cool. Big whisk attachments-cool use for them. They have an open kitchen and it smells wonderful. Lots of red and dark wood, feels very comfortable. \n\nWe ordered a Caesar salad, garlic bread and panzenella salad to start. The Caesar salad was the best I've had in a long time. Very garlicky, croutons that were warm, soft with a little crunch and a hint of fennel in the salad.  Just the perfect amount of fresh Parmesan cheese. The panzenella was delicious with the same lovely bread, fresh tomatoes and a great dressing. The garlic bread was cheesy, dense and delicious. Just like you imagine good garlic cheese bread should be. \n\nFor dinner, we ordered the spaghetti Bolognese ( for the little one), lasagna, and the Sunday Gravy. The little one wanted lasagna instead, so I traded with him. The kids' spaghetti was plenty for an adult ( I left half of it at that) and incredible. Some of the best I've had that I can remember. The lasagna, although expensive for what it is, was equally delicious. Baked in a cast-iron pan, it was warm, gooey and delicious, with a light tomato sauce on top. The Sunday Gravy was good, but he agreed that  the Bolognese and lasagna were infinitely better. \n\nWe didn't order dessert, but those around us who ordered got cannoli, which looked fantastic. By the way, Carlo's Bakery is across from Buddy V's if you want something for later. \n\nWe would definitely go back and definitely recommend!"

I will start with the good. The service was good, the meatball appetizer was good, and the fresh bread was great. This is where it stops, the spaghetti was somewhat chef boyardee tasting and the chicken parmigiana lacked flavor. Consequently the only flavor from that dish was from the cheese, which was all cheese no chicken. At this point the wife and I chalk it up to a loss and believing the hype and figures hey the desert has to be good, after all it's the cake boss right. WRONG!!!! This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal we got the cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was bland and lacked any depth and the tiramisu was also boring lacked any real flavor and to boot was but in a small Masson jar. Oh let's not forget the cookies that were served with the cannoli they were as hard as a biscotti. Now I can chalk up the good as a loss but the desert really?! That should have been second to none. The bottom line, if you want good Italian food and dessert go anywhere else but this overrated excuse of an Italian restaurant!!!!"

After my wife urged me multiple times and after I had refused multiple times, I saw my wife's fork with a crouton on the end of it right smack in front of my mouth. I succumbed to peer pressure and tasted what was probably one of the best croutons ever. The crouton had a crunchy exterior and then evolved to a smooth and creamy interior with a terrific garlic flavor inside. It was so delicious that I had to fight my wife for the rest.  Looking back, she probably regrets shoving that crouton in my mouth. \n\nI ordered the Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno which was served in an incredibly hot iron skillet. I think the cheese was still bubbling a little bit when they brought it out to our table. This was probably one of the thickest lasagnas I have eaten in a long time. This lasagna came with generous portions of fresh Italian sausage and ground beef and layered with ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The marinara sauce was a perfect blend of sweetness and spiciness and had settled to mostly the sides of the lasagna. The top was sprinkled with a tiny amount of Italian parsley. This was one of the best lasagnas I have had in a long time. Each bite melted in my mouth. There was no doubt I was going to finish dish.\n\nBecause of the reviews, tips, and photos of meatballs on Yelp, my wife had to go with the meatball spaghetti. Needless to say, she polished off the dish easily and said it was one of the best meatball spaghettis she had tasted. The meatballs at Buddy V.'s inspired her to go home and cook some meatballs herself. I think that in itself should speak volumes about their meatballs.\n\nWe had just enough room at the end to split their Tiramisu which was equally as delicious as our entrees. It was a nice touch to include a side of lady fingers in order to swipe any remaining coffee flavored cream at the end with them.\n\nThe service here was top notch. Our waitress was fully knowledgeable about the menu and was ready to offer suggestions. She was great from start to finish! \n\nEven with the coupon, I agree with the other reviewers that say this restaurant is on the pricey side."

Walked in around 5PM on a Tuesday night. We were quickly seated. We each ordered a sangria which shockingly were only $4 each since it was happy hour. They were delicious. Lots of good fruit in them. They were not cheapened because of HR.\n \nWe each ordered the same dinner, the rigatoni with lamb, pork, meatballs. and sausage. At a $26 price tag, I was very happy. Most Strip Italian places will charge $18+ just a plate of spaghetti alone. We meats were tender and delicious as was the sauce. The pasta, cook perfectly. Freshly baked bread was served before dinner as well. Again, delicious.\n \nI look forward to returning. The service was as stellar as the food."

One bite of it and my insides starting screaming. Mid-way through the meal, my sister needed to use the restroom.. for a while. \n\nMy margherita pizza? Equivalent to the taste and thickness of a napkin. Zero flavor and toppings spread so thin, they must have evaporated upon baking.\n\nAfter dinner, I left it to Lisa's Nutella Cake with Salted Caramel ice cream to save Buddy V's reputation. I mean, there's no way someone can mess those flavors up - the title alone is perfect. I was wrong. Overly sweet, dense, rich - one bite was too much (and must have contained at least 75g of sugar). The ice cream had nothing salted or caramel about it. I am a huge lover of desserts - and this made me so so sad.\n\nSummary:\n+long wait, pricey, not good - Why would you come here?"

My mom and daughter and I were all under the weather with a stomach bug and was disappointed that we couldn't get the upmost experience but we ordered the shrimp scampi, served with pasta. The shrimp was huge fresh and delicious. My daughter and I split the Filet served with mash potatoes...fabulous in both flavor and presentation and they divided it for us at no extra charge. We were so upset that we were not feeling well enough to experience anything on the dessert menu. I hope we can get back soon. I only have two complaints: the music was really loud so it was really hard to have a conversation and there were two, I assume, managers, one man in a suit and the other a lady, who cased the joint like they were one of the Sapranos...I understand they are paid to keep the place running smooth but I felt like if you had checked his pockets, you would find a pair of brass nuckles or something worse #RoadtripUSA"

            "review": "First thing first - Standout dishes:\n\n- Buddy's Caprese: I am normally not a fan of Caprese salads, but Buddy really nails this one. High quality ingredients, and finely tuned flavors make this a worthwhile starter.\n\n- Cheese Ravioli: I know what you're thinking. \"I can get cheese ravioli anywhere.\" Yes, you can. The great thing about the ravioli at Buddy V's, however, is that it is a perfect companion to Buddy's outstanding roasted tomato sauce. It's bright, tangy, smooth, and well rounded all at the same time. Definitely memorable fare.\n\n- Cannoli: I am normally not what you would call a \"fan\" of cannoli, but, once again, Buddy has proved me wrong. Most cannoli, in my experience, are disappointing in their grainy, and under-sweetened filling. Not so with these cannoli. Perfectly sweetened, incredibly smooth filling paired with just the right amount of cinnamon in the pastry make these cannoli worth writing home about. (Added perk: After eating at Buddy V's, you can walk right across the hall, and buy a whole box of cannoli from Carlo's Bakery to eat back at the hotel if you are so inclined.)\n\nNow, to business. There is definitely no shortage of Italian food on the Las Vegas Strip, but Buddy V's is definitely a major standout. Even among all of the other celebrity chef restaurants to be found in Vegas, the Cake Boss is definitely holding his own.\n\nMy wife and I stopped by for lunch one afternoon, and had a great time. Our experience was so good, though, that we went back for dinner two days later. For lunch we just stopped by, but for dinner we made reservations through OpenTable. Neither time was the place so busy one would need reservations in order to avoid a wait, however.\n\nHere are some highlights of Buddy V's worth noting:\n\n- The service at Buddy V's is excellent. They are easily on par with restaurants with much higher price points.\n\n- Having worked in food service, I am hyper-sensitive about cleanliness. I had absolutely no complaints here, however. The entire restaurant is very clean, comfortable, and inviting.\n\n- The pricing of most menu items is very reasonable in comparison with many similar Vegas eateries.\n\n- The whiskey/scotch selection at Buddy V's bar is truly impressive. It's not hard to find a bar that serves Johnnie Walker Black anywhere, but one that serves Johnnie Walker Green, Gold, and Blue is tough to find at any price point.\n\n- Unlike most restaurants in the Venetian, Buddy V's is right near an entrance making it an easy place to duck in for a meal without having to stray too far from the strip.\n\nFinal pro tip: Be sure to note on your reservation that you are celebrating a birthday, if that is the case. They have some fun, no-loud-obnoxious-singing-involved surprises for birthday-folk. I would imagine the same is true for most other celebrations as well."

It reminded me of the old Villa Penza and other old school joints where the cook or the owner mingles and sits with you for a while and makes you feel at home even though they know you are leaving.  These are the special touches that made the old school joints what they were with tile floors and checkered tablecloths and the food was nectar of the gods and 'ambience' was for people who didnt know anything about food.\n\nThese elements gave us the confidence to break some rules like 'never order spaghetti and clam sauce outside of the metropolitan area'.\n\nThe simplicity of this dish was a revelation.  The DeCecco macaroni was cooked to perfection, It was the perfect platform for the teeny tiny baby clams that are mandatory for this dish and no substitutions.  The fragrance of the baby clams, the garlic, the textures, it was just magnificent and like no other commercially prepared dish we have had in years.  Kudos!\n\nI dont like sitting on top of the kitchen.  Its too loud and too hot.  This was neither.  It was very entertaining.  They were loving the food they were preparing and it made you that much more excited about how good it was going to be to see this.\n\nThe veal marsala was fantastic.  It was good quality veal and the marsala was not cloying and sickeningly sweet as the cheap marsalas are.  This was proper marsala.\n\nThe osso buco was great, cooked to perfection, falling off the bone resting on a pool of creamy polenta.\n\nI highly recommend the 'birthday cake' for dessert.  Its an experience.\n\nWhile many of these authentic homestyle dishes are stylized for presentation, this is the way we really eat in  NJ.  Great meatballs.  \n\nThis visit was AFTER Gordon Ramsay Steak and in no way was it a letdown, it was right up there with GR.  \n\nKudos to Adam Margolies and his exceptional staff."

Cause if you do,  he knows a guy who knows a guy! \n\nThat said,  and it needed to be, I rarely eat southern Italian in restaurants because growing up in NY, I had the good fortune to eat the real master chefs cuisine,  my grandmother,  father,  aunts and friends parents. Anyway my point is,  I'm seriously biased. \n\nMy goal was to eat something tasty and not heavily laden with sugar,  flour, carbs as I'm in the middle of a book about that stuff which is gross, scary and fascinating all at the same time.  But,  I digress. \n\nI went for lunch and ordered grandma's meatballs and a side of Tuscan Kale with roasted tomatoes.  While I get that we didn't use real San Marzano tomatoes here,  it did come close to replicating an authentic flavor.  I should point out that meatballs to Italians is a very serious and personal matter. My extended family can argue endlessly on the what constitutes the perfect meatball, whether there should be inclusions such as pignola nuts, raisens and tons of other stuff you can't possibly imagine. \n\nThe Tuscan Kale wasn't on the menu,  but Star, my server,  not wanting to disappoint,  checked with the kitchen and they said they could do it.  I was very happy.  That's service! Problem was,  it came out very tough, chewy and barely edible.  So I appreciate the extra effort,  not the result, and the results are what matters. Once you commit to me, I'm expecting your A game stuff. \n\nAppropriate classic Italian Frank Sinatra,  Dean Martin, Louis Prima and other legends sang in the background. I'll go back ang give them another try for dinner."

My fellow event planners and I wanted to escape the 3200 person conference we were working on and go somewhere without strobe lights and bass, so we came here.\n\nI will start with the good:  \nThe decor here is great.  It takes up a corner spot on the Canal Shoppes level and you have a view of TI, the Trump and the strip.  It's rustic and familiar.  Red checkered napkins and rustic wood tables with interesting lighting fixtures.  My favorite was the children's artwork on the walls and the family photos everywhere (especially the dessert menu).\n\nThe food was GREAT.  I had the Orechiette with Italian Sausage.  It was flavorful and satisfying.  It had a perfect balance of al dente pasta, savory sausage and broccoli and tomatoes.  I wasn't starving, but I ate ALL of it. My team had the spaghetti and meatballs, the Burratta Salad and the meatballs.  They ALL raved without exception.  If it only depended on food and decor, i would have been more generous with my rating.   However, for me, service trumps it ALL. \n\nThe not so good:\nService was odd.  We arrived for our noon reservation and the restaurant was probably 1/4 full.  There were PLENTY of open booths that would have accommodated us perfectly, but the hostess decided on putting us at a table in the back.  Once seated we waited a bit to be greeted by our server, but he eventually showed and took our order.  Once orders arrived, we all seemed to receive what belonged to someone else.  Then we had an unfortunate situation that involved our waiter spilling ice cold lemonade all over someone in our party.  It was a mistake and I felt terrible for him.  But the problem was he didn't seem prepared for the situation.  He remedied it as best he could by getting help, some towels and eventually a staff tshirt for our young group member (which lucky for him was not someone in an expensive business suit).  At the end of our lunch he announced his apologies and included that his manager was so sorry about the situation that he would be sending over a dessert for the table.  Now I don't know about you, but once I was at BJ's restaurant and there was a spill at our table that hit a few of our shoes and the manager raced over, paid for our dinner AND offered to pay for our shoes and dry cleaning!  and that was at a chain pizza place!  I'm going to take a wild guess and say that if someone spilled ice cold anything all over one of Buddy V's kids, he wouldn't be so keen on getting a hard puff pastry filled with custard as an apology.  While the spill was the waiter's mistake, management could have comped her lunch or at least her drink -- which he still charged us for!   \n\nUnfortuantely, this is what I will remember most about my time at Buddy V's."

So saucy and full of meat, meat,  meat!!! Veal, sausage, pork, meatballs and bones. Ohhh the lovely bones. I ditched the rigatoni for spaghetti and I was soooo satisfied. Shame on me for swooping down on the soft and super tasty basket of bread like a starved hawk. So much bread made for a crowded tummy but I couldn't help myself. Butter and olive oil for sopping weren't necessary. That's just how tasty the bread was. Dessert??? There was no room and no way. This ain't The Olive Garden. The chefs in Buddy V's ristorante were definitely paying attention to their Italian grannies in the kitchen. I'm sure of it."

Actual octopus was fine; only thing was, there was only one bite and rest was filled by greens and potatoes!\n\nThen ordered Shrimp Scampi for main course.  It was with angle hair pasta which was fine.  Taste was fine.  Here again, there were only 4 medium size shrimps with tails on to make them look bigger than actually they were!\n\nI understand this is Vegas and understand this was inside of a casino; but, by no means one gets his/hers money's worth.

The ambience was very laid back, with piano music playing as we were overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The musician even came over to the tables to see how we were enjoying ourselves. I eat Italian food very regularly as I am Italian and from Boston, and this was up there with the best Italian dishes I've ever had!!! \n\nThe busser was so sweet and attentive we thought he was our server at first! Could not bring us enough bread or help us enough!! However the waitress had no personality, was rude when we asked about the happy hour specials and really did nothing for out experience.

The best part was their adaption if chop salad for a lunch salad it was huge!

They had only been open about 10 days or so when my friends and I went so I did take that into consideration when writing this review.  Upon entering the restaurant I felt that the decor was quite nice.  They have framed family photos all around the walls which gives it a \"homey\" feel.  Even though some of the prices may be creeping close to fine dining prices the cuisine is not fine dining (which I like btw).  The whole table had the Jersey City style fried Mozzarella, margarita pizza, chicken parm, warm nutella cake, and XL lobster tail dessert.  I really enjoyed the fried mozzarella as it was not breaded like traditional fried mozzarella but rather sandwiched between two prices of bread.  The pizza is nothing special to me and did not stand out compared to the same style of pizza at other restaurants.  The chicken parm was a good portion which came with pasta that really did taste homemade.  My friends thought the Lisa's warm nutella cake was the best dessert they have had in their lives!  The service was spoty and our waiter would be gone for long periods of time but the busboy always made sure we had what we needed.  I chalk that up just to being a new restaurant."

We were hungry, so we munched on until we saw our entrees.\n\nThe meatball sub was decent looking with seasoned fries. The fries were tasty, but the meatball sub wasn't worth the money. It was tiny and tasted like it had been heated in the microwave. It was still passable if it was about $10.\n\nThe caprese salad was not worth the $16 we paid. From left to right were a whole tomato, a small blob of caprese, about 12 cherry tomato halves drenched in dressing, and a spinach leaf. It was the tiniest salad I've ever eaten. Wasn't that good and definitely not worth the money.\n\nIf you're hungry and don't want to spend over $30 for two people, try somewhere else!"

You get up to the pastries and wait another 15 minutes to get your name called to pay. It a bit insane to have only 2 cashiers that can ring you up and keep this line control thing going.

The Garlic Bread Appetizer was so tasty, warm and very cheesy...we ate every crumb.  The Salumi & Cheese Board Appetizer was outstanding...very flavorful, quality, thinly sliced Proscuitto, Cappicolla and Salami along with Grana Padano and Parmeggiano, and Gorgonzola Cheeses and delicious olives. The entrees were a home run for all seven of us.  The Veal Marsala, Chicken Parm, Chicken Picatta, Steak Pizzaiola ...all perfectly cooked, good portion size and the accompanying Broccolini and/or Buttered Spaghetti Noodles just made the dishes even more pleasing.  The Sunday Gravy signature dish was excellent, the sauce authentic Italian and the combination of meats reminded us of our mother's and grandmother's typical Sunday dinners.

Some of the food that stood out to being especially good was the Sunday eggs, the chicken parm, panetone French toast, the caesar salad, the chicken apple sausage, and meatballs. There was mac and cheese there as well. This was the first time I had mac and cheese at a buffet or all you can eat setting, and it tasted exceptional. The noodles weren't over cooked, and the cheese sauce was tasty and creamy, there was a bread crumb like topping on it that help bring it all together. There was even some partially peeled shrimp there. Unlike some places, it was properly cleaned and deveined, on top of it not being over cooked and mushy. I wish the cocktail sauce that accompanied it had some more flavor and horseradish in it. The, what I were to assume, mini cannoli were excellent, even though they were already filled, the shell was still crispy and crunchy while the filling wasn't overly sweet.\n\nAll of the food I tasted had flavor, and was appealing to the eye, which tends to be a lacking attribute for a lot of buffet places. While you saw the cooks actually make the food, it actually tasted and looked like it was made from scratch, not something that came from a bag, frozen, or reheated from the day before.\n\nThe service was top notch. My glass was never less that 1/3 empty, and the busser made sure I always had fresh forks and knives when I came back with more food. The waitress and busser were very attentive, always making sure I was comfortable, enjoying myself, and asking if there was anything they could do for me.\n\nFor the price, selection and quality of food, and service, I was very satisfied with my experience at Buddy V's Ristorante. Not only will I most definitely be coming back for the brunch special, I would recommend the place to other people that I know."

Completely revamped and redesigned from \"First Food\" with clever flourishes befitting the Chef's roots throughout it was with the space fully reserved and full of energy that we arrived and after a brief wait in the bar a banquet built for six would serves as our seats for the next three hours - time that seemed to fly by under the care of a professional captain working alongside an enthusiastic back-server named Patrick, both who provided stellar recommendations pertaining to both the menu and local dining in general from start to end.  Speaking next to the food and beginning first with appetizers including a crisp, flatbread pizza with a touch of char and excellent acidity beneath the smooth mozzarella it was actually that the carbonara stole the show amongst the small plates as the tender noodles provided a toothsome backdrop to smoky smoothness while peas and pancetta added a one-two punch of sweet and savory reigning the dish back from being 'too rich' or one-dimensional in the least.  Continually tempted by the excellent focaccia it was not long after the appetizers had been cleared that main courses arrived and selecting largely based on Italian-American classics the trio that arrived along with a rich bowl of perfectly sticky polenta was anything but subtle, the enormous portions and big flavors all the result of family recipes and excellent ingredients - the Lasagna one of the best I've ever had while the chicken parm and Sunday gravy were relatively standard fare save for the gamey and supple slow cooked lamb, every bit of which was enjoyed with focaccia dipped in the sauce as the rigatoni was a bit past al dente for my tastes.  Moving last to desserts, a quartet ordered even as my fellow diners were throwing in the towel, suffice it to say that amongst my few steadfast dining rules is that I never leave a good dessert on the table...and when we walked out those plates were empty, the lightly boozy rum cake alone worth the price of entry and more than enough to get me excited for the opening of Carlo's Bakery in 2014."

The menu has such a great variety of classic  Italian staples. It was hard to decide what we were going to eat.  For the appetizer, we ordered Mozzarella en Carozza (\"mozzarella in a carriage\").  Hands down, this was the most delicious appetizer we've had in such a long time.  The crust was nice and crispy.  But the gravy (sauce) just took it over the top.  It was so full of flavor.  It was a nice balance of tomatoes and basil.\n \nFor the main course, my hubby ordered the Sunday Gravy.  I loved the presentation.  They served the meat in a separate metal pot.  Plenty of sausage, lamb necks, pork and meatballs.  It's served with rigatoni.  This entr\u00e9e was so tasty that we immediately started looking for the recipe on the internet.  I ordered the Linguini with Clams.  It came with plenty of clams.  The portion sizes were perfect.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed by the time we were done with our meals.  However, we wanted to try a dessert while we were there.  I loved the dessert menu. It looks like a family photo album with pictures of Buddy and his family.  We selected the Italian Wedding Cake.  I didn't think I had any room for dessert.  But this little cake was so good that we knew we had to finish it all. Luckily we had a long walk ahead of us. The restaurant was at the far end of the shops in the Venetian.  We will definitely make this a must the next time we're in Las Vegas.   You should too.  We plan to try the chicken parm.  The atmosphere was what were looking for.  It was like a huge Italian farmhouse kitchen.  And you could see into the kitchen.  Loved the whole experience."

But my friend wanted Italian for dinner so we went to Buddy V's. She was excited about it. \n\nMy absolute favorite, I order it wherever I go, Italian dish is eggplant parmesan. Somehow at Buddy's it is an appetizer, not an entr\u00e9e. Luckily I asked the server and she was able to make it an entr\u00e9e and add a side of pasta. I was nervous, not knowing what appetizer eggplant my look like, but it was delicious. It was layered slices of perfectly fried eggplant with a chunky tomato sauce and cheese. Honestly, I was half starving from walking all day, but I would say this is one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had. I cleaned my plate. \n\nSo, food was fantastic. Our server was pretty mediocre, but I was so happy with the eggplant I don't even care. They get 5 stars from me. I may have to give this celebrity chef more credit."

The salads were good.  The Caesar salad croutons are very different.  There almost like a cornmeal texture.  The arugula salad was delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was ok, but I'm sure it would be excellent if made fresh.  All around, the pastas were kind of disappointing.  It's cool to have a bottomless mimosa/Bloody Mary option.  Roughly $15, but it's bottomless.  Service from the bartender Emily was fantastic!  Not a remote complaint in that department.  We would come back, but won't do the brunch."

Everything was so delicious and satisfying. The dessert menu was a nice touch as well because it is like a family photo album which I thought was a nice detail.

We were seated in the couch/lounge. I thought it looked cozy, only to sit on an extremely awkward, low, deep sunken in seat. Odd. But can be overlooked. \n\nOur server Christin was nice enough, not really helpful when we asked for an opinion of favorites. So I ordered the veal marsala and my husband ordered the ravioli. (How can you mess up ravioli?) Well... after a long wait for food to roll out, his ravioli was disappointing and very very salty. Same salt issue with the veal. My pasta on my plate tasted like pasta roni, and was cold. My veal, extremely hot. The ravioli portion was small and didn't even begin to fill him up even though he tried to stomach the saltiness. \n\nOur birthday canolli was a nice thought, but we didn't really eat it. Maybe we ordered the wrong items? But this felt like a dressed up version of the olive garden. A bit disappointed to end our trip this way. My favorite meal was at B&B downstairs."

I wasn't bowled over by either the service or the food, (except for the desert).  It was just kind of okay and most likely won't go back.\nFirst off, the restaurant is tucked away in a spot that has a fantastic view of the Strip, but the internal design was emotionally cold.  I want an Italian-American restaurant to be warm and inviting and this place was trying too hard to be fancy, (which is most likely a result of its being in the Venetian). \nWe didn't order any appetizers but for entrees my wife had the Veal Marsala and I had the Chicken Parm.  My wife and I both loved the taste of our meals.  They were both well prepared but both were a bit on the small side for the money they are charging. The Chicken Parm had only two cutlets and the side of spaghetti was only about a half a cup's worth.  Same with the wife's dish.  Like I said both tasted real good, but not really any better than any other Italian joint in town. Also, they give you fancy Focaccia bread with dinner.  Sadly they offer no butter or Olive oil to go with it and really, the bread had a distinctive taste to it, which made it non-optimal for dipping.  I'd rather have warm, fresh, and plain Italian bread over the fancy stuff. \nFor desert we shared a Tiramisu and that was fantastic.  The quality and taste of it was spot on.  \nAs far as the service, the wait staff was very attentive.  Our waiter was professional but a bit stoic.  \nWe probably won't go back because I can get just as good Italian food from a local spot 10 minutes from my house but the desert was great so maybe it's worth it to try lunch there instead of dinner paired with desert."

Unfortunately they were booked for the night, but the hostess asked if we'd like to sit at a high top at the bar.  Since they offered the full menu we readily agreed.  Within minutes of sitting down we had waters and our waitress greeted us.  The service was great and she happily gave recommendations.  We started with the calamari and it was excellent, the fried anahiem peppers were a great counterpoint to the calamari, which was cooked excellently.  I ordered  the chicken parm and my wife had the chicken picata.  My chicken parm was delicious!  It was two chicken breasts fried to perfection topped with mozeralla and a side of spaghetti with marinara.  I'm very picky about my marinara, I can't  stand when it's sweet, and this was done really well.  Very savory and went perfect with the chicken.  My wife's picata was cooked wonderfully as well but was lacking in the citrus.  She asked for a plate of lemons and was able to season to get desire.  We finished off the meal with a lobster tail dessert.  The pastry was beautifully done, the cream rich and smooth, and the berries tasted very fresh.  \n\nAll in all it was a great meal, my only gripe was the decor / ambiance.  It was like they couldnt figure out what they wanted to be.  The decor was that of a nice italian restaurant, low lighting and dark wood.  But their menus looked so cheesy like something from Farrels and the busers all wore bright red shirts but the hostesses wore little black dresses.  They need to go either elegant or cheesy, either would be fine but straddling the line is kinda weird."

Your better of going to the polazzo and eating at carnivore. \n\nWe started off with the mozzarella sandwich in marinara sauce which was pretty good. Very hearty and pleasantly seasoned. Then my wife ordered the chicken parm which she enjoyed. I ordered the meatball sub, I know what your thinking \"meatball sub how can you judge off of that\" well the waitress told me it was a signature and it sounded good for lunch. Well my take on the sub was the bread was great, a little butter action with the melted mozzarella, but the meatballs were not so good. The texture was not there for me, it was like the microwaveable meatballs, honestly if you blind folded me and but a subway sub in comparison I would probably pick the subway sub."

Kept trying to force us to have the family meal, when we declined dessert he kept telling us full or not we had to have it. When one of the kids asked about a dish he told them when he was young you ate what was put in front of you and explained to us how we care to much what they (children) think. Overall food and atmosphere was great ...maybe we just weren't getting the waiters spence of humor."

We found the outside menu to be very interesting and the offer of happy hour irresistible!  unfortunatly, the man we met at the front desk did not share our excitement.  He acted irritated with our presence, but when asked, directed us to the upper level of the restaurant as the appropriate area for happy hour values.  after selecting a place to sit, we were accosted and told not to sit \"there\" as \"that\" isn't happy hour seating, \"this\" is happy hour seating.  (beware the hi top tables as they angle your drinks to the floor). Our poor waitress (April) seemed very unhappy to see us. She described a few of the beverages when asked, but after ordering \"bellinis\", she told us the Bellini machine was broken. When asked if the drink could be served on the rocks, she acted shocked and said it was impossible as it was made from a mix. We heard the bartender say the machine wasn't quite ready. When quizzed, the waitress said it wouldn't be ready for \"hours!\". We settled for the house red, and let me tell you, i do mean settled.  the transparency of the liquid lent itself more to watery cool-aid, with legs and bouquet to match. We did sample a pasta appetizer, which might have lead us to believe the food was worth putting up with the service, but a smart phone app lead us to better Venetian opportunities. Our party was met with a hostile glare as we were fleeing the establishment, and i was forced to resort to mad dogging the man(ager?) to make good our escape. \ngreeting cold, directions sketchy, service irritated, food potential but unknown, farewell hostile.  1/2 star...."

However, the cold air was blowing on us the entire time and I didn't go to Vegas for the cold weather.  Please fix this.\n\nFood: Turkey meatballs were wonderful.  Chicken Parm was chewy and probably overcooked.  We came for the desserts and were disappointed that there isn't a more traditional cake.  I realize you have to spice things up, but if you are going to have funky desserts, you should also have at least one boring chocolate cake."

I had the meatballs for an app. You get 3 in a small boat of gravy (pasta sauce ) And they were spot on east coast Italian meatballs. They use the holy trinity of meat which is hard to find on the west coast and the sauce can't be beat . This is the kind of sauce that makes me want to step up my game because it Puts my gravy to shame !! For the meal I ordered the bucatini carbonara - again it knocks your socks off. The pasta is cooked perfectly , pancetta is crispy and the sauce light and creamy.. Simple and elegant . For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which came in a 2 oz canning jar and 3 lady fingers .. What a divine way to end a perfect meal. As a side note my husband ordered the 3 course meal as well. He ate it before I could get a pic , and I didn't get to try anything he ordered except his dessert . So we will have to take his word for it when he says the tomato basil soup was fantastic , and his chicken Parmesan  was the best he's ever had . He stated that the chicken had a light breadcrumb coating (he hates when it's thick like some sort of chicken bird sweater )  and his side of spaghetti was cooked perfect and served with the same type of sauce as my meatballs . For his dessert he ordered the cannoli.. Oh holy cannoli was that amazing!! I ended up eating it for him as he is lactose intolerant .. A good wife would have explained that cannoli are stuffed with marscapone cheese ! But.... Here we are .."

A 3 course dinner for only $30.14!! I had Grandma's Meatballs for my app & Chicken Parm as my entree. Restaurant week's portion came with 4 meatballs. 2 pieces of chicken & a small but good size spaghetti. Both were just amazing. So much flavor in the meatballs & you can see the herbs when you cut into it. The breading on the chicken parm was perfect. Not too thick so it's not filling. The spaghetti sauce was simple & delicious. Mini donuts as the dessert with a chocolate & raspberry I think it was sauce to dip. 5 small pieces I believe. Spiced sugar coating the outside of the donut. \n\nThe specialty cocktail list was awesome! Everything looked good! I ordered the DRAGO ROSSO-absolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalape\u00f1o & mango. A spicy treat! I've always wanted to try a spicy cocktail & this one was amazing. I had to take small sips cause my throat burned a little! The jalape\u00f1o seeds were floating at the top too. I think I should have asked the bartender to not make it that spicy. But it was good! Priced at $14. \n\nThe restaurant is beautiful! It's huge. The kitchen was open so you can watch them cook (love that). Brick walls & floor to ceiling windows with great views of the Strip. There are old pictures everywhere & cool decor. Unique chandeliers & a great wine shelf! We had a great table next to the window :) \n\nService was great! Everyone was so nice. I even got a birthday dessert from them with a sparkler attached! I will be coming back!"

It almost brought a tear to my eye eating that food because it tasted so much like what my grandparents would make for us. Those grand meals are unfortunately a thing of the past, but Buddy V's brought it back to life. The meats in the Sunday Gravy were perfect, the pork was so tender, and you can taste the flavor in every bite of the sausage and meatballs. It was quite a feast and a pretty good value considering that you are right on the Strip. My wife had the lasagne and it was massive. The service was excellent, attentive, but not overly. \n\nBuddy, your pastry shop may not be great, but your Italian restaurant is. Great job! Thank you for bringing a taste of New Jersey to Nevada.

I have to admit that so far, your dishes taste just as good as your cakes (well...the cakes look good so maybe as good as your cakes look?) \n\nI booked reservations for seating on Open Table for my sister's birthday. Told them the occasion and requested a nice little \"surprise\". They did more than that. They gave us the best seat (take note here because this seat is the seat you want) in the house. You walk past kitchen, past the bar, and the main floor. You'll see these big windows that help open up the room with natural sunlight. In front of that window lies a simple yet perfect table for four. You can look right out and see the strip from above, and if I'm correct the pirate show at TI also!\n\nMy sister and I ordered the garlic bread, caprese salad, meatballs, and Chicken Parmesan. \n\nThe MEATBALLS are definitely one I recommend, but beware! These come as appetizer and can be very filling! So if you intend to make it to dessert, I'd be careful with this one. One order would be good to share with your party. It's so full of flavor, juicy, and tender. Major noms. I think it's because of the veal. \n\nThe GARLIC BREAD. Oh the garlic bread is also a major 5! Extra cheesy, extra buttery, and extra extra garlicy. An extra 5 points if I could because it tastes just as good as a leftover. It came with 4 HUGE pieces and one is a good size to split in half with another (that is if you're a light to medium eater). \n\nCAPRESE SALAD is also a great recommendation if you're looking for a nice salad to eat. Full of color and flavor. They have like 3-4 different types of tomatoes in it. There was cherry tomatoes and some tomato that is red, purple, and green (it's good I swear!). It was topped with a perfect ration to cheese and drizzled around with a light olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \n\n**CHICKEN PARMESAN two extra stars because Buddy V's chicken parmy will probably become that GO-TO-MUST-HAVE dish. I mean it's just chicken parmy right? I know...but it was perfect. The sauce wasn't too much nor thick or overpowering. The breading on the chicken had that perfect crunch to their tender chicken. It had that nice bed of creamy melted cheese topped with a wonderful POW of garlic flavor and herbs and spices. I'm a variety seeker so I always go to different place and try different things, but once I find THAT DISH it's hard to steer me away from it. That dish is THIS PARMY.\n\n**DRAGO ROSSO-It hasabsolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalape\u00f1o & mango. It's divine! I love spice. This has a whole lot of spice. If you're into bloody mary's or the mexican drinks with the clamato juice. You have to try it. WARNING though. It is really spicy so if you only like a lighter taste of spice for your palette I recommend you pass.\n\nBUT! Service was great, the ambiance was amazing. Casual, but upscale? More for business meetings, lunch, and special occasions. Lastly, it was cute after my request they surprised my sister with bakery made cookies with a light up sparkler.\n\nSee Jojo S. review for photos: http://www.yelp.com/biz/buddy-vs-ristorante-las-vegas#hrid:pp5PFMp8IqNGvdkgnQe5HQ"

However, we stopped in for a late-night dinner after seeing the Beatles Cirque show at the Mirage, when not much else (even in Vegas) was open at 9:30pm on a Sunday. And Buddy's turned out to be the Boss. As in, very NJ Italian.\n\nCaesar salad usually has hard-as-rock bread croutons. Not here. Buddy's croutons were amazing, soft, warm polenta/cheese cubes. Loved that! The Chicken Piccata was also very tasty, a generous portion with lots of capers and lemon. Very nice. Cute Italian breadsticks-in-wrappers on the table. Surprised and pleased with our meal. \n\nFinally, don't get the weirdly-frosted cupcakes at the Carlo's bakery across from Buddy's (the ones with gobs of over-colored icing on the top). Instead, DO get their authentic Italian/NJ \"lobster claw\" pastries filled with cream. You could die. They were that good."

The food, was absolute amazing the best Italian food I have ever eat. Our waiter was the most patient caring and professional waiter ever (Giorgio) is a must ask for! I would give 12 out of 5 stars!"

            "review": "I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.\n\nThe cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:\n\nBuddy's Caprese\n\nChicken Parm & Spaghetti\n\nZeppole\n\nThe next day I at the following:\n\nThe meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!\n\nBuddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. \n\nBuddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!\n\nChicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. \n\nLisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. \n\nZeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. \n\nThey also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here."

We were seated at the worst possible table in the restaurant right up in the front and the hostess wouldn't budge when I asked to be moved after I saw a lot of tables available since it was 9:30pm (strike 1).  Our waiter was fast talking and nice but he really tried his best to have us order more than we wanted and actually charged us for a salad which he said was going to give us compliments of the house and then forgot all about his promise at the end of the dinner (strike 2).  Those two experiences were the true reason why I brought the score down because the food (except for the salmon) was very fresh and delicious.  \nCharred Octopus-amazingly good\nPanzanella Salad-fresh combination of flavors\nSeared Salmon-overcooked and dry (strike 3).\nBuddy V's is a very large and pretty modern restaurant with decent prices but the little incidences along the way had me leaving on a sour note."

We asked to sit at a booth after finding the chairs too slippery and uncomfortable. When we asked to sit at booth it was like we bothered her. \n\nOnce we got to sit down we were promptly served by a great busboy. Our waiter was Rocco.  He did a great job. We were talking and were not quite ready to make our order just yet but the rude hostess came over took all menus but one and said we could share? Does this place not have enough me\u00f1us? \n\nThe food was ok. I got the angus burger on brioche and others got pasta items off the menu also said it was ok but not for price. Fries were not savory. It was just ok and overpriced. \n\nIn the past I have tried the zappolis and wedding cake and they were phenomenal!!! But on this trip  I was just here for food. I wanted to give this place a better score but I was not happy with the limited selection, prices and the taste. \n\nMaybe just a bakery there would of been great."

Slow service from the wait staff, arrogant manager on-duty, and one-drink-at-a-time bartender make this restaurant experience drop a couple of stars. The positives are a very nice greeter, fast kitchen and casual Italian ambience. Skip the basics, don't get the spaghetti or lasagna al forno because they are not much better than local joints. It's expensive for what it is, so you might as well go for the good stuff. Try the veal or chicken parm, veal Marsala, and the bar. I'll try it again and hope it gets better."

When we showed up I was automatically taken back by the lack of personality and sheer lack of respect from the hostess. I must have high standards seems how I work in a restaurant but I certainly would expect more from a restaurant of its caliber and popularity. We had no greeting, no hello, no nothing. When we were seated we were handed menus and we knew it was a bit pricy before we went so that wasn't a shocker. It's the Las vegas strip and you're paying for the name. But honestly for the price and because of the name I really pictured a warm, friendly atmosphere. Not a cold environment where we were treated like we intruded and were not welcome. I felt so sad for my daughter. She was excited to go there for the amazing experience she thought she'd have and to have my 12 year old on her birthday feel so let down and disappointed about the service is very disheartening. She felt like she was personally let down by Buddy himself. The food was good but when you feel so unwelcome, it ruins the entire experience. Such a bummer that the Bake Shop service wasn't any better either. Can't say I'll be going back and I Definately don't think this is how Buddy would want people to feel walking into his restaurant because he is such a family guy who's welcoming and makes it feel like home."

Essentially nothing to write home about, the lasagna was just ok and rather small in portion while the Caesar salad was below average but did have croutons that were awesome (warm and soft).

The much anticipated chicken parm was a little on the dry side but nothing a little more sauce could've helped with. It was just the right amount of food. My heavy lunch was offset by the refreshing lemon sorbet with biscotti. Very strong lemon flavor, it was good! I would also suggest the Panzanella - i tried a few bites and it was a really great salad if you're looking for something lighter to start your meal with.\n\nFun touches related to baking and family incorporated into the decor.

Some of us loved the calamari, the other half thought it was too tough.  The eggplant parm was actually hard, so I'm glad it was a shared appetizer instead of a meal. I had read great things about the lasagna...but I must say, I was slightly disappointed.  The portions were huge but if nothing about the dish makes you want to  eat more then who cares?  The chicken parm was GREAT!  But the pasta it came with was OVERLY salty!!!  The Osso Bucco and Polenta were OUTSTANDING as was the Veal in bone parm....although another party at the table complained there was too much cheese on that.  The XL Lobster Tail for dessert is to die for :) ...and I really loved the cannoli.  The ambiance was great....and like I said, the service was stellar!  The portions were great, ... I just have a few complaints....and a few disappointments.  Would still give it another try to taste a few more things before discounting it."

Hubby had the enormous veal parmesan chop and it was the size of a dinner plate. Our friend had the lasagna, and I had the scallops. All the entrees were excellent. They miss the mark a little on dessert. Although I had a molten nutella cake which was delish, hubby had the Italian birthday cake which was extremely bland and very disappointing. Our friend had the lemon cheesecake, which had a nice bright lemony flavor, but I'm just not a fan of cheesecake, so I can't impartially rate that. Overall, a great dining experience, although the place is extremely loud and I was hoarse by the end of the meal from trying to be heard over the din!

I'm not some snooty restaurant goer either.  I used to work in a restaurant, so I know how it's not hard to be an okay server.  However, that being said, we were there for a Bachelorette dinner, and we had maybe 2 small interactions with our waiter.  He was extremely show, didn't check on us once, but decided to charge us extra for some souvenir cups we didn't ask for and failed to inform us that a smaller bottle of water was $10 each.  We waited for 30 min after we were done eating for him to come by to us and check if we wanted anything else or our bill.  Horrible service and really disapointed about this restaurant as I'm a huge Cake Boss and Buddy fan.  If the service improves by a lot, then I'll be back, but until then, I'd rather be checking out other restaurants on the strip."

I highly recommend this restaurant for the good and the atmosphere."

Food is either always really good or just a little off -- like too salty -- but still decent. \nThe desserts are always ridiculously good, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and lobster tail are delicious, the desserts are definitely the best part of the meal. Customer service, not so good. Servers disappear or really rush around to where you only see them 10% of your entire visit when it should be more like 40%. Drinks go unrefilled and putting in orders or requests can take a while. \nGood food, a little pricey. Just wish the servers would slow down and be more attentative to their tables needs. Wouldn't normally say anything but been here 5 times and noticed this every time."

Our server, Peter, was so incredibly friendly and was joking around with us the whole time. He definitely made the experience an unforgettable one! The surf and turf was SO good, my steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare and that lobster! Yum! We order the garlic bread and mozzarella appetizers and they were both just delicious. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was INCREDIBLE. As was the lobster tail dessert and the Nutella chocolate lava cake thing. We will definitely be coming back! Thanks, Peter for the great service! Oh, and the prices are so reasonable! Between $30-$50 per plate but it has the atmosphere more like a fine dining setting."

The interior may skew towards an over-the-top, typical Italian restaurant  with red and white checkered tablecloths and a panoply of picture frames, but there are cool touches like the light fixtures and use of rolling pins throughout. The place doesn't reinvent the cuisine, but executes traditional Italian-American dishes with a few subtle modern touches to create one of the better Italian restaurants on the Strip.\n\nThe eggplant parm app has plenty of great flavor, but could have benefitted from a crispier exterior. The dough of the aggnolotti was a touch thick, but the crispy texture from being pan fried was a nice touch. The sweetness of the sauce with the savoriness o the pork filling was great. The winner of the night was the huge brick sized portion of lasagna that arrived in a small cast iron dish. The mixture of proteins along with the boldness of the ricotta made for a wonderful combination that was only enhanced by the depth of a red sauce that any Italian grandmother would be proud of. For little ones, there's a kid's menu available. Among the items was a large order of buttered noodles that my kid loved. No meal is complete without dessert, and the nutella cake was a satisfying way to end it. It's their version of a lava cake with a rich, moist cake enveloping a gooey nutella mixture. A scoop of salted caramel ice cream accompanied it with a brittle underneath that added a good contrast in texture.\n\nThe execution was solid and the dishes different enough from your typical Italian American joint to make Buddy V's a good choice among moderately priced restaurants on the Strip."

The size, first, and then the shell of the pastry wrapping the custard. It was so hard I could barely chew it, much less finish it. The custard itself was good though. \n\nThe bake shop outside of the restaurant is all I'd ever go back for.  Their cinnamon cannoli's are much more worth the price for their quality."

He definitely steered me in the right direction for dinner - the cheese raviolis are out of this world! We also had a few appetizers that ended up being a meal - grandmas meatballs were heaven, the mozzarella cheese appetizer was not like anything I've had before (in all the right ways), and the antipasti plate was this awesome combo of cheeses and meats and olives that I was swooning over. The only bad part? No room for dessert! Guess I'll just have to go back next time I'm in town!!"

A four because my Drago Rosso cocktail was very good, a touch of spice and the mango garnish was delish. Also enjoyed a regular Caesar salad, but the \"croutons\" were actually yummy, warm, cubes of polenta, right on! Now for the \"eh...\" Sunday gravy plate - loved meat variety, but couldn't look over salty sauce. Service was okay, couldn't find her half the time, but when she was there she was attentive and kind, without being over the top. Lastly, I made a reservation, confirmed the next day, and when I showed up at five 'till then said they couldn't find it. A 4 because they said they'd sit us anyway, and we did within 5 minutes, but how do you lose my reservation?

Spaghetti and meatballs were home-made tasting, in my book that means you can taste the true tomato flavor and it is not overwhelmed by the many spices normally found in spaghetti sauces. 5 medium size meatballs complement the pasta in a heavenly smelling and tasting treat. Garlic bread was buttery, crispy, garlicky, and substantial. Calamari crispy, peppery, with lots of tentacles. This is how calamari should be.\n\nWait staff amazing, in my book. I had technical questions about the tomato sauce, as in how their Bolognese is prepared. Suffice it to say, it tasted great...not too infused with basil and oregano. Polite and courteous, all staff were pleasant and kind.\n\nThe breadsticks were wrapped in separate packages. Just ask for more if you want more. Real grissini torinesi, as they are long and thin, with a hint of olive oil taste.\n\nAs good as it gets now...if you've read my reviews, I only give 5 stars to any place only after it has consistently shown, after many visits, that their quality and commitment never wavers."

Absolutely positively horrible.  Nice people, don't get me wrong, but horrible service.  The \"bread guy\" needed to be told what to do in his job but why couldn't he remember on his own you fill up the water glasses and you keep offering the focaccia?  The waiter was sure to tell me that it was his helper's 19th birthday, but who cares?  Do your job and party later.  The floor manager with the dark black hair and who I believe was dressed too casually for this type of price point restaurant wasn't doing much of anything.  He barely looked up from his texting while showing a waitress what he was texting and laughing about to mumble \"Good night.\".  Help your waiters out man!  Be a team! I believe the waiters have too many tables to be able to give you the service you deserve for paying those \"on the strip\" prices.  My hubby did state his linguini with white clam sauce was not flavorful at all.  He ended up asking for a lot of cheese on top, which you have to wait for also since it is not on the table.

I had the whole wheat penne pasta with pesto and veggies, delicious with a lot of flavor but still light. Hubby had the shrimp scampi with perfectly cooked shrimp and angel hair pasta and a light and flavorful sauce. \n\nThe prices were pretty good for Vegas so we felt we had a good value, but it was really too bad that the overall experience didn't match the quality of the food.

We were expecting a burst of flavor but there wasn't much to it except for ground meat.  Not much seasoning to it at all and it was honestly, something that I make better at home.  For the main course, I ordered the chicken regatoni \"alla vodka,\" which I always have to try at all italien restaurants.  It was pretty good except a bit on the salty side.

The hostess lead my group to a table by the window and we were seated and given menus.\n\nThe items on the menu seemed really good. I knew I wanted something with sausage while the rest of group went with the steaks and spaghetti. The first issue came when everyone had decided on what they wanted and they server took 20 minutes to come back to the table to take our order. That was somewhat odd especially since when the drink was taken he overlooked my order, seriously!!!! I had to ask another waiter who was helping another table to grab my drink, that's not good.\n\nNext, when the waiter did eventually come over to take our orders he insisted on orders rather than giving recommendations, hmmmm, not smooth! The issue with the orders was that everyone's order was taken except for one but that member of my party could not order because the waiter has walked away after getting the 5th order. Why would you do that when there is another person at the table!!! Once again, we had to get another waiter to add another steak to our order because our waiter was unable to do that the first time!!\n\nAs for the food, my meal was great. Everyone that ordered a steak loved their food. However, the spaghetti, I was informed, was a bit sour! I did not try it but I told by another member of my dinner party. \n\nOnce finished with our food. We had to wait another 20 minutes before we could get the check. Getting the check went like this. In finally getting the attention of the waiter I got two words out asking for the check and then he interrupted and didn't let me finish to offer dessert. Seriously, usually there is a back and forth in communication but this guy had to speak over me, confusing to me! Again, he was insistent about getting a dessert rather than suggesting or recommending. \n\nOnce I finally got the check everyone was ready to go because this waiter was just no helpful in explaining anything or being attentive to our party. Not a memorable birthday dinner for the birthday girl after talking with her about her dinner. She liked the food but the service a bit aggressive. I guess working here causes the workers to be impatient and overbearing. I don't think so because the other waiters that I talked to were very gracious about assisting my table. I think the gentleman that helped us that evening was just trying way to hard and no making a good impression. \n\nThe food was fine but the service was below what I expected based the reviewed I have heard about Buddy V's. I wanted to 5 star this place but the service killed that potential rating. I hope this situation does not happen to anyone else. But, kudos to the chefs in the kitchen who worked hard to prepare the food.\n\n#buddyvhelpmeout"

The drinks...they were certainly not messing around with a lack of alcohol but it wasn't so much to ruin the flavor of the drink! With their current special, depending on what drink you get, you can take the glass home. Overall lovely experience and I wish we had on in Kansas City!"

Also,there is no bathroom in the restaurant so you have to schlep out into the hotel which is a pain. \nThe food was fine, not really memorable. The decor was odd, it was like old home comfort mixed with a modern feel? Either go old home comfort to match your food or go modern? The server was nice and personable."

Pretty much a nonstop flow of people refilling our drinks, taking our plates, checking in on us and making conversation.  There was kind of a weird moment at first when our group first came in and went up to the hostess podium and two young guys up at the front literally just turned and walked off without saying anything, but later on made up for it.  \n\nMost of the food was delicious (a few hot items were cold already due to there being too much AC in here, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it's not under their control).  They have mini cronuts!  And really excellent french toast.  Our whole group was very satisfied - there was something for everyone - seafood, veggie items, fancy meats, lots of sweet stuff."

Expectations were low.The last brunch I had was at Yardbird, and if you read my review on that, you may understand why. \n\nBuddy V's offers about 25 food items, and 10 dessert items for a $35 price tag. They also offer a selection of unlimited alcoholic beverages for another $15. \nThey also have a limited al la carte menu that offers pretty much everything that is already on the buffet, but why would you pay $23 for just chicken parm?\n\nHere we go...\n\nAs we walked in, the aroma of GARLIC just punches you in the face! \n\nMy! How quickly expectations can change. \n\nWe were warmly greeted buy 2 pretty hostesses, and immediately sat at a table. I couldn't wait to look around. Our server greeted us, and went over the workings of the Sunday Brunch. We also got the unlimited alcoholic beverage option.\n\nMy lovely wife got sangria, I started with a domestic beer, then went a red wine. Sangria was great, and so was the vino. We stuck with that for most of the meal. \n\nAs a foodie, I have to say ALL the food offered was FANTASTIC. If you like Italian comfort food, this brunch will satisfy all your needs, and make you eat way too much. \n\nI ate so much, I did not eat again till the following day. \n\nThe italian sausage on the carving station (see pic) was luscious. The fritatta delish, orecchiette pasta amazing, the french toast unlike anything I've had before. Chicken parm was tasty. They put fried polenta croutons in that amazing fresh, cold, caesar salad. Meatballs were nice. My wife loved the ham on the carving station. \n\nEVERYTHING was so good, so good, so good. \n\nI visited the dessert station and discovered a totally different Tiramisu than what  I'm used to. This one was done with love. It was light, wet, and beautiful. The bread pudding and red velvet cake changed my mind about not liking bread pudding and red velvet cake. Hey, the cake boss apparently ain't no joke. These desserts were great. I can't wait to go back to try the Italian wedding cake.\n\nI thought I was done after dessert, but went back to get more of that sausage and meatballs. With a little garlic bread of course. Also had a bloody caesar that was very good also. \n\nDid I mention how good everything was? Man! this place is my new Sunday after church brunch spot!\n\nI've been to buffets on the strip that offer 3 times as much of a selection for about the same price. You know what though? No one could possibly try that much food. Even if you could, not EVERYTHING would be fantastic. The other thing I dislike about buffets is that the food is almost NEVER hot. \n\nBuddy V's Sunday brunch offers a smaller selection of fantastic HOT, FRESH food in a buffet style setting. \n\nThe food is so good, that when you float out of there on a euphoric foodie coma trip the last thing you think about is the price. A total value experience."

I didn't have high expectations for this place because it had a very chain restaurant feel. SO WRONG. \n\nOrdered:\nx Panzanella Salad w/ Shrimp (buffalo mozzarella, focaccia croutons, tomatoes, arugula, balsamic red onions) - Salad with lots of flavor. Wait, what? It was perfect with the added shrimp, but I think if you order it without protein it'll feel more like a side salad. LOVED this salad. Croutons were amazeballs.\nx Grilled Salmon (Mediterranean chickpea & artichoke salad, roasted tomato vinaigrette, balsamic) - L-L-LOVEEEEE! I like salmon, but I don't LOVE cooked salmon. kinda tastes the same for me everywhere I order it, but this one was excellent. Highly recommend for a healthy option from the menu. All the components complimented each other very well.\nx Butterscotch Creme Brulee - My favorite dessert in the world. I didn't really care for the cookies or the vanilla cream it came with, but the creme brulee itself was perfection! Probably one of the best ones I've ever had. 10/10 would recommend.\n\nService was extremely slow, but the food made up for it. Ask to sit by the window and enjoy A+ food with a strip view :0)\n\nCake boss knows wssup."

Even after a bottle of wine and our dinner it was so light and airy. Amazing.

The beef tenderloin was on the rare side for a medium.  Kudos to the kitchen.\n\nFor the service, I'll keep it short. Just our luck as first time diners to get the waitress in training on a Saturday night.  It would have been tolerable if she had any personality or acted if she even cared about our experience there.  Never engaged us, we had to continually ask for refills on water,  and brought me the wrong drink.  Trainer right at her side, for what? I blame the management and trainer for this.   Servers in training should be up to speed for the weekend dinner service before being put there.  When customers leave satisfied with the food but disgruntled over the service after paying nearly three bills for a mediocre dining experience, you end up losing a repeat customer.  \n\nYou want great reviews and repeat business? Then don't use the trial by fire method with new servers and send them to charm school first."

We spent a good hour narrowing down Italian food restaurants based on reviews and the menu, and we were very disappointed with our experience at Buddy V's. When you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming, dimly lit, guy playing the piano, and nice decor. That's where the nice experience ends. Once we sat down, our waiter tried to hard sell us on this wine that was clearly the wine the restaurant wanted the waiters to sell that night. We had to tell him \"not interested\" at least 3 times. I don't expect to get hassled and given the \"hard sell\" by our server at a really nice restaurant. The food we received tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. Definitely did not taste fresh. We started out with the Meatball appetizer. The meatballs had no \"crispiness\" to the outside. The sauce was thin and had no flavor.  My boyfriend got the Lasagna (which was supposed to be their signature dish), and I got the Pasta alla Vodka (normally very yummy if done right). The sauce with the Lasagna was runny and had no flavor. He even commented that the Lasagna I made at home tasted better than what he got at Buddy V's. As for my Pasta alla Vodka, the sauce was runny and had no flavor, the chicken was tough, and the pasta wasn't cooked enough. I went to an Italian food restaurant in Shenzhen China that had better Pasta alla Vodka. To top it off, the menu prices were $25+, which is kind of what you expect from Vegas, but I expect top quality food at that price, and especially from a celebrity chef. Do not eat here."

My husband ordered the Lisa  V's linguine & white clam sauce and I ordered the chicken parm. The servings are big that I could not even finish one of the pieces of chicken parm after the app. and of course saving room for the lobster tail for dessert that we shared between the both us because it is huge. It is bigger than the ones you get at the bakery across the from restaurant. \n\nEverything we had was soooo good and can't wait until we go back in the future to try something different on the menu but this time it will be for dinner to have a bigger selection to choose from than the lunch menu."

The restaurant was not as accommodating as before, and did not honor our reservation request for a booth.  Instead we were seated at a table where one-half of my party of four was temporarily blinded by the sun near sundown.  Then we settled in, and things soon improved.\n\nGrandma's Meatballs covered in Red Sauce (Sunday Gravy) were authentic classic Italian meatballs, and Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza was a hot and cheesy confection once again.  Calamari Fritti was another nice starter.  And the complimentary Focaccia Bread was great.\n\nA big side of Caesar Salad was good.  And Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno was again one of the best lasagnas I have ever tasted--besides Diane's vaunted cheesy and saucy concoction which won the 2014 Ardiente Lasagna Baking Championship in a blind tasting by judges.  This time I did not even bother to finish the whole rich lasagna dish.  I filled up on half of what was presented to me, and took the other half home.  Alas, Diane failed to persuade the chef to make her Veal Parm Alfredo, and had to settle for a good Veal Marsala instead, which unfortunately arrived late to the table.\n\nFor dessert we were served great Cannoli compliments of the chef, to make up for the late arrival of Diane's dinner entree.  Service was excellent except for the ordering miscue, no peppers offered on the side of the Calamari Fritti, and no available Roasted Potatoes this particular evening.\n\n4-1/2 stars overall!"

We were greeted by a smiling Italian server who explained to us that we could enjoy the food one of two ways.  The first way being just ordering our own thing off the menu and enjoying it like that or secondly we could close our menus sit back and let the restaurant take us on a culinary experience.  We had to go with a culinary experience.  We were amazed.  The firsts course had meatball, calamari a meat and cheese board and a great salad.  Entree was sea bass, chicken and pasta, lasagna and filet and for dessert a Italian cake and their signature lobster tail.  Everything was so good good and service.  Didn't expect a pastry guy to have such good dinner food"

            "review": "Restaurant week provided the perfect excuse to try Buddy V's. We dined with a group of nine. Service was a bit sluggish at times, but otherwise attentive. They started us with delicious herbed focaccia which paired well with oil and vinegar. I only wish they left the bottles on the table so we could help ourselves. We didn't know upon ordering, but draft beers in the 20 oz and Liter sizes come in a souvenir glass with $9 refills (the cost of a pint). So, that was a nice surprise when ordering a second round. \n\nThe restaurant week menu is $40.15 and it came with choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. The majority of the table ordered Grandma's Meatballs, made with beef, veal and pork. They were tender and juicy, the marinara sauce was nicely balanced and flavorful. I was quite pleased. Likely, the second best meatball in town. Those that had the Panzanella Salad seemed satisfied, the mozzarella was very fresh. \n\nThe table tried each available entree: Pasta Bolognese, Sea Bass, Carbonara, and Chicken Parmesan. Each were beautifully prepared and damn tasty. My Sea Bass was perfectly seasoned and brightened with a spritz of lemon, the side salad was fresh and light, which was welcomed since I was already pretty full. The chicken parm came with a nice helping of pasta and two lightly breaded baked cutlets topped with mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The pasta across the board was the ideal al dente. \n\nAnd for dessert we had a choice of tiramisu or cannoli. Both were well executed and scrumptious. I loved dipping the lady fingers into the layers of the creamy tiramisu. The cannoli was filled end to end with sweet ricotta; no hollow center. \n\nI was a little skeptical, but dinner was delicious. Many celebrity chef restaurants fail to deliver, but that's not the case here. It has good eats and casual charm. If you have the opportunity, there's still time to check out the restaurant week menu which is an absolute steal. It's well worth navigating the labyrinth that is the Venetian. Don't park at Venetian like we did, I believe Palazzo self parking would provide better access."

Its setting: rustic and contemporary with a homey ambiance that's reflected in its decor. The tall windows open up the space, providing view of Las Vegas Boulevard below. All right, enough of the interior design, on to the food!\n\nAppetizer - Caesar Salad with Polenta Croutons, Parmesan, and Eggless Garlic Dressing: During Restaurant Week, I ate my share of Caesar salads from one restaurant to the next, and this one was the best because of the polenta croutons that were crunchy and soft at the same time. I wish I could eat this salad every day. \n\nMain Course - My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara with Pancetta, Cracked Black Pepper, and Egg: One word: Divine. Ok, maybe a few more descriptive terms like creamy, pleasing to the palate. I would lick the entire bowl if no one was looking. \n\nDessert - Cannoli: Good, but not the best that I've had. It definitely packs a crunch and isn't too sweet as is, but there's always the option to sweeten it up further by dipping it into the chocolate sauce that it's paired with. \n\nNot on the Restaurant Week Menu. \n\nAppetizer - Garlic Bread: Topped with melted fontina and mozzarella cheeses. Makes a good, tasty starter. \n\nDessert - Lobster Tail: Filled with buttercream and garnished with fresh berries. Pretty yum, though difficult to cut into. \n\nService - Staff members were always aware of our table, never missing a beat.\n\nOverall - This has quickly become a new Strip favorite of mine, and I'm already looking forward to my next meal here."

I would like to start off and say that we are lenient when it comes to services.  It is a very hard job and not everyone is cut out for the job and unfortunately Perry M. at Buddy V's is one of them.  \nOur evening started out with us walking up to the hostess station around 5:15 that Sunday evening.  We asked the two ladies if we could have a window table.  They stated it was going to be about 20 to 30 minutes.  We stated no problem that we will go to the bar and have a drink to please come over and get us when the table was ready.  They stated that was fine.  We ordered two drinks at the bar and about 20 minutes later we saw two tables being cleaned at the window area.  So my husband was paying close attention and before we knew it the hostess was taking up a couple that had just arrived.  Luckily a table was being cleared up behind them so my husband had to go grab the hostess to remind her of our table.  She then remembered we were waiting and sat us down.  Point being, if my husband wasn't keeping an eye out we would have lost those window seats we were waiting on.  \nNow on to our next adventure, we meet our waiter Perry M., he asked if we wanted water and we stated we did.  The assistant waiter came through and gave us bread and I stated thank you to him, but got no response back.  Perry then came back and got our food order.  The food came out as scheduled and was delivered by a young gentleman from the kitchen.  Our assistant waiter came by and gave us more bread and again I said Thank You with no response.  I come from the south and when someone says thank you, your response should be Your Welcome or My Pleasure.  To me this is plain rude.  Again, we are just holding our tongues in the whole situation.  My husband wanted another beer.  Ever since Perry ordered our food we never saw him again at the table to ask how everything was.  I told my husband to put the empty glass on the edge of the table maybe he will notice it and walla' he did.  My husband asked for another beer and he went on his way.  At this time our water glasses are now empty.  Well after 10 minutes still no beer has arrived at the table.  By this time the dessert has arrived and my husband and I are sharing a glass of water since we have not been refilled or asked if we wanted any.  Again, we are not saying anything.  We don't ask for much.  We know it is hectic sometimes doing this job.  We were going to let go not getting the beer, but we do like for our water to be filled up WITHOUT having to ask.  So we just asked for the bill and were just going to chalk it up to bad experience and not return.  Until our bill came, the first two charges are for the restaurant week special at 30.14 per person (which is correct).  Then two additional entrees where added and the kicker was he added the beer that never arrived.  Our total check should be in the range of 60+ change, but the total was 122.00.  So that is the point my husband lost it and grabbed the manager.  \nThe manager that night was Sean Fiori whom assisted us.  We explained everything to him expect the experience with the hostess earlier.  We explained our experience with Perry M and his assistant.  We showed him the bill and he immediately apologized and said he will fix the bill and gave us an after dinner drink to make up for not getting the beer.  We are not people to complain.  We put up with a lot from waiters/waitress, but this was awful.  We are simple people and want to be acknowledged and respected and just fill up our drinks every now and then.  Literally he orders our food and gave us the messed up bill.  That was all and wants us to tip you on this service.  Don't get me wrong.  We had no problems with the food, but the service made this experience awful.  Hopefully he gets continued training or he needs to find another profession."

This is Buddy Valastro's (celebrity chef from Cake Boss) restaurant, so I figured it has to be good and it did live up to my expectations.  I ordered the Chicken parmesan and spaghetti. It's oven-baked, provolone, and mozzarella.  It was crispy and with the perfect amount of cheese.  The spaghetti was with marinara sauce-$22\n             \nMy wife ordered Lasagna Al Forno, which apparently is what they're known for.  The lasagna contains italian sausage, beef, pork ricotta and baked cheese on top. My wife was a fan.  It was $22.\n\nThe portion was big enough to share, which we should have done, since we had food coma shortly after. The customer service was great and our server was attentive.  I just think the food is pricey for Italian food and it didn't even contain any seafood, but then again anytime you have a celebrity chef attached to the restaurant's name then expect to pay more, so excuse my rant."

The eggplant Parmesan was mouth watering my delicious, and caprese salad had the freshest ingredients. The four sides we ordered (polenta, asparagus, kale, and mashed potatoes) were a bit too over seasoned or cheesy, but the main dishes were phenomenal. Highly recommend the cheese/cured meat board.

There were family pictures on the walls that gave it that homey feel, and I have to say I really appreciated that the restaurant was spacious, so it didn't seem cluttered.\n\nMy friend and I ordered Aunt Nina's Mozzerella en Carozza, which was fried mozzerella with crotini in a tomato sauce.....OMG!! So Freakin good!!!! We were tempted to order another one, but decided to wait till we had tried the rest of the food we ordered. \n\nWe also order the linguine in white clam sauce that was also pretty good, it had lots of clams yummy!\n\nFor dessert, we got a lobster tail and a cheesecake. The lobster tail was too f*ckin good!!! We were in heaven, the flaky pastry filled with fresh custard cream and fresh berries, it was perfect balance! Not too sweet, not too tart, the berries complimented the pastry perfectly.\n\nNeedless to say after that we were stuffed, so we had to take the cheesecake to go.\n\nThis place is a must for Cake Boss fans!"

While it was good, it wasn't great by any means. Just okay. I did appreciate the al dente noodles though. \n\nBut the most surprising thing was the desserts. I get it, you want to include some family favorites like cannoli's, but still. No cake? What about featuring mini cakes that are decorated? Just something to play off the show.

As I was choosing from several options the Buddy V's credit sealed the deal as I can always fall back on this restaurant to serve delicious \"homemade\" comfort Italian food. With this I convinced my family to dine here for dinner.\n\nDinner is a different beast from lunch. With lunch the No1DP and I are able to have a pretty quiet meal with plenty of natural sunlight. There's also not much activity going on in the middle of the day. Come dinner, especially on the day before NYE, the place was swamped and the tables were loud. There were also plenty of people in line to get a table or in line for the nearby Carlo bakery.\n\nThe 3-course pre-theater menu ($38/person) was a hit with everyone in my family. It made ordering a lot easier and since I was covering the dinner tab, along with the $25 credit made a Vegas dinner more reasonably-priced (but still expensive for regular casual Italian). What made it particularly appealing for me was that the menu options included my favorites: Grandma's Meatballs, My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara and Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake. These were the standout dishes I stated in previous reviews and I was very happy I could have all my favorites in one sitting. This was a lot of food - I remember eating cold bucatini carbonara the next day for breakfast (which BTW is still very good if you don't mind eating it cold).\n\nIn summary I've enjoyed both lunch and dinner at Buddy V's though the situations that I'll recommend both are different. I'll recommend doing small plates for lunch as the portion sizes are more manageable if you want to save your appetite for a big and fancy dinner. This is currently the arrangement for the No1DP and I whenever we're in Vegas. I'll recommend dinner as a non-date or casual date option if all a party wants is just some good comfort Italian food.\n\nLUNCH: 4/5.\nDINNER: 4.5/5."

I've never been to the original one in New York, but I'm guessing they serve many of the same items in Vegas. It was just as crowded as the restaurant if not more.

Food wasn't really bland as a prior review said. The apps needed a little salt, but all else was good. Service was great and not slow as mentioned in other reviews. Prices are reasonable and portions aren't gargantuan so you have some room for desert. Very neat place and I'd go again for sure. The wife liked it as well. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if it was an option."

The line was super long so we sat at the cake boss restaurant to save time since they sell the same pastries in both. We had two pastries and a drink and water and the bill was $41dll I don't mind the price if it's good, but this was just ok, average. if you ask me its terribly over priced :( maybe my expectations were to high and that's why I seem harsh Lol. Save your self some money and just make the huge line for his bakery and don't waste your time and money at the restaurant. Line is about 20 minutes long. Service was terrible,  the waiter took forever to take our order and after he did  he took even longer to bring the drinks out, we just paid for the bells and whistles, which soumded more like beeps and toots, Lol"

Sangria was good, it's a blend of white and red wine which was different. Only complaint was service was slow.\n\nWhen we moved into the restaurant area, our experience just got better from there. Service was fabulous! All of the wait staff were very attentive. We ordered grandma's meatballs, lasagna and the chicken parm. The meatballs were absolutely delicious! Best restaurant meatballs I've ever had. My husband raved about the lasagna and talked about it the rest of the night. We would definitely go back just to have that. Chicken parm was good, but not the best in LV. The sauce on all the food had great flavor and consistency. Being Italian and growing up in NY, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be back!"

My wife had chicken marsala.  there were 4 full breasts in the order.  it was a huge portion.  She liked it.\nWe passed on dessert in order to gamble sooner.  Overall, the food was ok but the price for what we got was too expensive.  \nThe next night we went to Lavo in Palazzo and spent $20 more per person and had a way better eating experience.

The open floor plan just makes the restaurants main Dining area feel like it's right in the middle of the mall. However despite this minor flaw the food here is authentic. Our waiter was from Naples and had a true passion for the food he was serving. Our apps were delicious including the Caesar salad and calamari. The meatballs were top notch. For dinner I ordered the mixed meats with pasta. The dish had a name but I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. The lamb was fatty though which is why I can't go to five stars. Plus the dish was missing a component in my opinion. Like maybe some cheese or vegetables. My friends dishes all looked good. No one seemed   blown away but we were definitely satisfied and impressed by the cleanliness and authentic Italian cuisine we were served."

Great customer service and great ambiance! They were very accommodating and on top of things, Kudos on that! We ordered various things from desserts to appetizers, the most disappointing item was the veal, it tasted funky and it had a weird smell to it, so i returned it and they graciously took it off my bill. the tastiest item we ordered was the linguini with clams, but it wasn't amazing, the other items like calamari, osso buco, grilled cheese, was ok, but not great as well. The lobster tail dessert was just horrible, it was as hard as a rock! I am sorry to say that my expectations were a bit higher, especially since the menu was a bit pricey, but even if the menu was more reasonably priced, the taste was just not exciting my palate. I mean overall it was a fun time, I don't regret celebrating my baby's first birthday there, hey at least the baby loved the free bread sticks, but would I come back? Maybe if somebody else paid, i would be willing to give it another shot, also keep in mind that they just opened this location, and every restaurant will always have its growing pains, that's why these reviews are necessary."

Family photos of the Valastro family, hodgepodge furniture, comfy sofas and chairs...only thing missing is the vinyl and plastic covers, but honestly who misses them? \n\nTeaming up with Kim Canteenwalla & Elizabeth Blau, who have created beautiful restaurants here in Vegas (Society Cafe + Honey Salt), the trio came together to make the Cake Bosses culinary debut a real knockout, start to finish. \n\nI went with my Italian buddy to try it out and we were really impressed (to say the least)! Straight forward and diverse food menu, doesn't overwhelm; drink menu follows the pattern of the food menu with good wine choices by the glass.\n\nI chose the agnolotti which was seasoned perfectly and was in season with the sage brown butter sauce. My buddy went to spaghetti central with a rigatoni and meatball bowl and he couldn't hold back the tears knowing the impending rejection his mother would give him after finding a better meatball. \n\nThe meatballs came really really really close to beating my Italian grandmother's secret recipe, but that leads to a lifetime of questions and heartache on my nonna. So, its easier to say that grams are better and avoid the remaining years of rejection by telling her a little white lie.\n\nDessert was the highlight (as expected) as my Tiramisu was not only flavorful but semi deconstructed as the lady fingers were on the side that you could dip into the cake and creme combo. My friend's salted caramel ice cream came loaded with bits of dark chocolate and an awesome biscotti.\n\nIf the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian/Palazzo's Grand Canal Shoppes: A) It would be way busier and the menu prices wouldn't be so high; and B) it wouldn't have awesome floor to ceiling windows facing the strip that make the space even more visually enjoyable.\n\nMangia!"

Surprisingly their dessert was the worst course and cannot recommend. (3) service is good and prompt (3) value: it was okay for Restaurant week special but I would skip this place at regular prices. \n\nWe came in to try their restaurant week lunch menu which serves a 3 course lunch for $20.15. \n\nI got her Caesar salad,  grilled salmon over a cucumber/chickpea/artichoke salad while the hubs got the tomato basil soup and spaghetti and meatballs.  Both came with a dessert course of cannoli and cookie selection. \n\nThe tomato basil soup was a little too bland and needed more basil. The texture was good.\n\nI liked the Caesar salad better albeit it was a little heavy on the dressing and needed more acidity. The hubs thought there was a little too much anchovy in the dressing but I kind of like that. The polenta croutons were a great addition textural and flavorful. \n\nSpaghetti and meatballs was really nothing special and the sauce was too bland -  there really wasn't enough tomato flavour to really make this dish stand out. The meatballs were under seasoned. The spaghetti itself was cooked a bit beyond al dente which in a dish like this,  makes it disappointing. \n\nMy salmon dish fared better. The grilled salmon was done perfectly. However the salad of cucumber,  arugula,  chickpea and artichokes was a bit underwhelming and needed more acidity/brightness to bring the flavors together. \n\nThe worst course was dessert. It each came with a cannoli and 3 cookies -  oatmeal, chocolate chip and sugar cookie. The cinnamon cannoli was okay albeit rich...there wasn't enough cinnamon in there to really distinguish itself. The cookies were really bad -  they did not have that rich buttery taste to them. The sugar cookie especially tasted more like shortening and artificial flavors. I think they also skimp out and use cheap artificial vanilla extract.\n\nAfter we finished lunch I was watching the bakers at Carlos bakery. Guess what I saw? A half used package of pre-made manufactured Rice Krispies treats with the shiny blue foil packaging and Kelloggs branded elves (see the pic). Seriously. As a bakery,  you cannot make rice krispie treats yourselves? (Just FYI, all you need is a microwave,  marshmallows,  butter,  rice krispie cereal, a bowl,  a spatula and 10 minutes to make this dessert). To me,  that is just bad form. \n\nAt the end of the day, I give the dining experience a 3 star -  it's okay but nothing I would return for. As for Carlos bakery -  just the cookies and the aforementioned shortcut I saw are enough for me to stay far away."

Perfect! \n\nThe buffet is divided into five stations: starters (charcuterie, shrimp, antipasto, soup, Caesar salad); carving station (props to the bacon and the spicy Italian sausage); Kids corner (Mac n cheese, pizza, candy); entrees (loved the meatballs, chicken Parmesan, carbonara Mac n cheese) and DESSERTS! Delicious tiramisu in mason jars, cannoli, and zonuts were my favorite. \n\nThe buffet is $34.95. I opted for the extra all-you-can-drink mimosa deal for $14.95 and you can choose from mimosa, Bellini, sangria, beer or wine. The Bellini was tasty but that sangria tho! I'm embarrassed to say how many glasses I had. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the Bloody Mary deal for $18.95 in which they bring the vodka and you craft your own Bloody Mary from a different station. He had fun doing that (and adding shrimp from the appetizer station) and he also got to choose from all my drinks. He ended up switching to the sangria as well and drank as much as I did. He got to keep his glass as a souvenir. \n\nWe got seated right away with no wait (even during March Madness weekend) and I can't wait to come back. Wish it was served every day!"

Speaking of kids, the kid menu portion were also huge.  As it turns out, 3 of us could have easily gotten a way with a single entree.  These were heavily cheesy meals with pasta to perfection.  \n\nWhat keeps the place from being a 5 is that the actual quality wasn't that special but it's a definitely above average offering and experience"

I had been there before, she had not but i raved about it. \n\nWe had a 7:30 reservation and showed up a few minutes early. We were seated right away which is always nice. We had a great table with a view of the open kitchen. \n\nOur server came over to bring our drinks but it seemed to take him a rather long time. This would be indicative of the rest of the meal.  As we watched our server he seemed to have tables all over the restaurant so every thing we asked for took a long time. \n\nCome to find out the server did have a servers assistant but it would have been nice if he introduced this gentleman to us so we knew who to ask for what. \n\nThe food was good but I would not go back again any time soon."

So, for everyone in the world who LOVES Buddy V as much as I do, be a NERD and come eat here (Don't forget the pictures, lol!)\n\nWHERE: Located inside of the Grand Canal Shoppes of the Venetian and or Palazzo.\n\nWHEN: Monday through Sunday from 11:30am-10pm; Friday & Saturday from 11:30am-11pm. & most importantly, Happy Hour from 4:30-6:30pm! =D\n\nWHY: BECAUSE EVERYONE'S DOING IT! Lol, just kidding. Wouldn't you like to take part in a sit-down lunch or dinner with your friends and or family in Buddy V's first restaurant in Las Vegas?! & also because Carlo's Bakery is going to open in a few weeks to months just right across the restaurant! SO PERFECT!\n\nWHAT: The first time I came here, my family and I did dinner. As I walked into the restaurant and to the table, I noticed the perfectly dim ambiance that filled the entire room. I love ROMANTICKLE restaurant settings! It makes me HAPPY! \n\nRandom Tangent: Sometimes I make words up so don't dictionary.com them because it most likely won't be in there. Haha\n\nSo as my family and I were seated, we were handed the menus and ordered. I love dinner with family because we purposely order something different so that we can try each other's food! Too good!\n\nFOOD:\nChicken Parm- I personally got the chicken parm, and it was excellent! I wish there could have been a tad bit more spaghetti with it, but overall Yummy!\nMargherita pizza- My younger cousin chose this pizza, and I'm glad he did because there were slices for every single one of us! SHARING IS CARING!\nNonna's Lasagna al Forno- My older cousin ordered the lasagna. From the bite I took, I remember wishing I ordered it! It was definitely a hearty meal because there were leftovers! Thumbs up!\n\nDESSERT:\nBuddy's XL Lobster Tail- As I was scanning the dessert menu, my eyes suddenly zoomed into this dessert! I absolutely love the flaky pastry shell that enclosed the yummy, creamy, and PERFECT custard cream! (Everytime I go to NY, I search for Lobster Tails!!)\nLisa's Warm Nutella Cake- My cousin is addicted to chocolate, as this made his eyes light up! I loved the hazelnut praline crunch, good touch to the chocolatey goodness!\n\nI still want to try the rest of what's on the dessert menu!!! GIMME GIMME GIMME!\n\nHAPPY HOUR: My cousin and I just made it in time for HH the other day, and we went HAM!\nGrandma's Meatballs- The perfect tasty, softy GOODNESS! I love these meatballs!\nMacaroni & Cheese Carbonara- I am a mac&cheese fiend! This mac was pretty good. I've never had it with peas, but it actually gave it a sweet taste, GOOD COMBO!\nCalamari Fritti- Loved the grilled lemon pinwheels, banana peppers, and the tomato aioli! AIOLI!!\nMeatball sliders- We couldn't get enough of the meatballs, so we had to order it in bread!\n\nLastly, try the \"CAKE BOSS\" chocolate martini! If you love chocolate & alcohol, it was a really good mix! Tasted exactly like a chocolate cupcake... the only difference is it is in LIQUID FORM, and you may not be able to walk straight after! Lol\n\nBefore I continue typing, I am going to STOP and leave you with one thing... ENJOY!! & LET ME KNOW WHEN CARLO'S BAKERY OPENS! HOLLER! =D"

The Caesar salad has delicious cornbread croutons that are soft. Chicken Parmesan is well made not anything special. The chicken piccata is excellent and very flavorful. Tomato Basil soup is well but not anything special. The lasagna is on par with several franchise locations nothing extravagant. The Nutella cake taste like any other chocolate cake I could faintly taste the Nutella. The salted carmel Ice cream and raspberry sherbet is excellent and has a unique flavor. The cannoli is very good as well and is a must to order if you come here\nI will say the service is excellent. Waiters are very attentive and are aware of their customers desires and level of drinks. The service is very friendly and insightful on the menu.      \nIn conclusion many of the dishes are very normal tasting. The desserts are very good overall. It is overpriced for what you get in respect to food but I say it's good to try once. If you are in for the deserts the bakery across has the same ones but will have a long wait."

The staff was wonderful as well, from the hosts at the front all the way to the manager who greeted us and had a minute or two conversation with us. \n\nThe menu suits itself to family style dining. My wife and I each had drinks, split garlic bread with oil and vinegar, and the pollo rigatoni alla vodka, which is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The polenta croutons on the Caesar salad must be tried to be believed. The salad looks so simple that you might be disappointed when it comes to the table vs. my wife's house salad with beautiful heirloom tomatoes, but both were exceptional.\n\nContrary to many of the reviews I read, they do bring some small bread. Thinking that we didn't, we ordered the garlic bread, which could easily be split between 4-6 people. It was a little much, and if I did it over, I'd leave off the garlic bread and order dessert. We were simply too full! \n\nI'd you're looking for phenomenal food that's not terribly expensive (with drinks and all we were under $80), don't even give it a second thought, and come here. You may want to reserve your table through open table or something similar to get in quickly. Our reservation was delivered exactly on time."

I asked what is this??? The server proceeded to tell me that the chef did not think a filet would go nicely on a Caesar. I told the server that I ordered the meal and not him. This really frustrates me. Cater to the customer, especially when this is a middle of the road restaurant. I also had (2) vodka and soda with a lime. The third one came with lemon.

The food is a bit better than Olive Garden with some good items like the Sunday Gravy.  If you're expecting high quality Italian food this might not be the best stop. If you want some comfort food at a decent price, this is a good choice. \n\nSadly they don't have much from the Carlo's bakery dessert menu though."
