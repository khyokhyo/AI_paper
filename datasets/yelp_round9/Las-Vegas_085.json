I stumbled upon this restaurant back in 2011 when me and my friends stayed at Palazzo. I was hungry and wanted to eat so I went on my own wandering off to look for food #fatkidstatus because all of my friends were tired or drunk lol \nthe noodles just hit the spot and its been hitting the spot ever since."

I ordered the Spicy Ying Nan soup -- it was very flavorful but be careful if you're weirded out by seafood.  There were fish balls, squid balls, and shrimp in it.  Imagine a meatball made out of ground fish and squid (calamari).  They were fine though.  My friend ordered the Won Ton soup and it was really good too.  Give this place a try!  They were open until 3 am and packed!"

Great spot to grab a quick snack.\n\nWanted something light and had the wonton soup, which was perfectly light and refreshing. Comes in both cup and bowl. They also serve traditional bone-in chicken soup with ginger - would try this next. \nHas a few classic dimsum selections if you're craving a quick snack (ha gao, shiu mai, pot stickers, spring rolls). Tried the shrimp & chive pan-fried dumplings, which were excellent. \nWas unimpressed with the Five Spice Tofu - was told the tofu was braised, but it's actually fried and bland without the XO chili sauce on top.\n\nService was pleasant and professional, servers also speak Chinese.\n\nNOTE: Hard-to-find - stumbled upon the cafe randomly while walking through the casino floor - it is hidden in the back corner of the Venetian casino floor by the betting screens."

            "review": "So conflicted about this place. On one hand, Chinatown has some legit noodles and it's not too far from Venetian (like 5-10 min drive or cab ride). \n\nBut sometimes, I'm just feeling lazy as fuhh when I'm in Vegas, especially if I'm being a degenerate at the casino. And Noodle Asia just so happens to be right in the middle of Venetian (which has the best, affordable rooms on the strip), so that convenience factor is pretty big. \n\nThis place is pretty Americanized tho, I mean who the hell would put \"Asia\" on their name if they actually served authentic Chinese food right?\n\nHowever, the food hits the spot most of the time. I've tried the Hong Kong Won Ton (typical won ton noodle soup) and the beef stew noodles and they both helped my hangover.\n\nOnly bad thing is that the prices are hefty, which is standard for Vegas casino food. You'll be dishing out $12-15 for the same shit you can get at Sam Woo's for like $6-9. If you're not looking to get ripped off, then I suggest checking out Noodle Pot, Monta Ramen, or Pho Kim Long. All those spots are in Chinatown."

In retrospect, maybe ordering Pho at a Chinese restaurant isn't the smartest thing because it tasted exactly like what you might expect - a Chinese take on a Vietnamese dish. Thin broth, definitely not prepared for hours with the love one must put into creating a deep flavored beef broth. And the spices were off - maybe a little too much on the Chinese five spice. In all fairness, I will have to go back and actually try the Chinese food to truly give this a proper rating."

Perfect timing, as they are open til 3am.\nWe partied at XS @ Encore and walked back towards the Venetian just to have some chinese grub, instead of taking the taxi to chinatown back/forth for the same amount of dough.\n\nHad the porridge dish as well as the fried chicken wings & also the szechwan beef noodle soup and singapore fried noodle.   Sounds like alot of food for the 3 of us, but it was actually pretty good to cure the buzz and the quality wasn't bad for casino chinese food.\n\nOnly gripe was, the porridge was lukewarm and they promptly took it back and heated it up nicely for us.\n\nWorth a shot if you just want some quick chinese food and are near the Venetian."

Even though my wife and I are not picky eaters, we felt the same way that both foods(beef noodle and chow men) are very salty and filled with MSG. I don't believe why I had to wait for more than 20 mins to taste this crap!! If you do not have much appetite for very salty MSG with overrated price, do not think of visiting this place. There are many places for good chinese food even in food court at venetian even you do not drive to china town 3 miles away!"

In between all the fine dining, it's nice being able to escape from the Vegas bustle by not having to leave the Strip and cozy up to simple nostalgic home dishes.\n\nSzechwan beef soup is a traditional favorite of mine with the broth having the right amount of spice flavor and heat. The beef is tender and the noodles are on point being chewy and soft. \n\nThe fish filet congee is another comfort food. The fish is delicate and congee is cooked well. Personally, I wish there was more fish and this requires a couple dashes of salt, but after doing so at the table, it is perfect.\n\nUnlike typical Chinese restaurants, traditional Chinese cooking at home doesn't drown the dish with oils, sauce, and salt which is why Noodle Asia brings such comfort to me."

Now that it's a Chinese restaurant, it's a total upgrade than what it was before.  The place is small and doesn't have many tables.  We were lucky enough to get in before the lunch rush.  By the time we ordered our food, there was a long line and people were waiting for tables.\n\nThe food here is delicious!!!  A bit pricey, but what do you expect from Vegas and the Venetian?  Dishes were in the $10-18 range, when you can get it at home for about half the price.  (Chicken chow mein was about $13-15).  We had lunch for 4 people and ordered Fried Rice, Chow Mein, beef tripe appetizers and spicy garlic chicken wings.  This was the best chow mein I ever had.  The noodles tasted soooo fresh and delicious.  It wasn't salty and the onions were cooked al dente (the way I like it).  The fried rice was also delicious.  It was fresh and wasn't greasy.  The spicy chicken wings were topped with fried jalapenos and garlic.... OMG! Flavor explosion!  This place is pretty authentic.  None of that Panda Express, PF Chang's bullsh*t here.\n\nI love that you can see the Chinese cooks inside the kitchen!  There was lots of steam and yelling back there, but I loved it! Hahaha..  \n\nNoodle Asia gets 5 stars because it's right off on the casino floor and a few feet from the penny slots.  While we were waiting for our food, I stepped out of the restaurant to play some penny slots for a bit.  A minute into playing, I won $60 on the penny slots!"

It's inside of the Venetian (in the casino by the slot machines) so it's worth it if you're really craving a quick bowl of noodle soup and don't want to make the trip to Chinatown. It's a little pricey-the noodle soups will run you about $15 per bowl, but you're paying for the convenience of the location. Ambiance is nice and casual. It's open to the casino and you can see/hear the slot machines going.\n\nFood: It's okay, nothing spectacular. Been here a bunch of times and always get the same dishes: wonton noodle soup, Cantonese beef stew, veggies. Usually everything tastes fine, but on this last visit the broths were very bland, almost tasteless.\n\nService: Surprisingly subpar for a restaurant located inside of the Venetian. In the past it's been quick and decent, so maybe they were just having an off day. I can certainly understand service being a little slow when it's super busy. But this last visit to Noodle Asia was not during a rush, maybe about 8 tables were full. Service was very very slow. Asked for some extra chopsticks and had a pair LITERALLY thrown onto the table by the waiter who couldn't bother to walk an extra foot. Getting the bill was also an endeavor and took probably 15 minutes. The other tables were experiencing the same frustration too, I could hear the table next to us loudly complaining about how long it was taking.\n\nI'm sure we'll be back though because it's convenient. Hopefully food and service will be better next time."

I realize that they have to deal with drunk people all day and night BUT I WAS SOBER. \n\nMy problem is with the service. Not once did someone come to refill our waters. I happened to down my water in the first 5 minutes at the table. YES I was hungover. YES my mouth was like the Sahara desert. Everything was pretty do it ourselves including getting our bill. Had to flag down 2 different people just to get our ONE bill. \nThis is the part that gets me. When the lady came by with our check she handed it to us then proceeded to STARE US DOWN AND BREATH ON US until we put a card in and returned it to her. UM.. can we please get a minute to ourselves since we had to give you 10 minutes to even get this to us? Life isn't always fair I guess. Then the lady returned WITHOUT the credit card we had put in it but with somebody else's signed receipt. The only thing that could make the service worse at this point was if she started eating off of our plates. \n\nI'm glad the service was nonexistent when we needed it but the minute we wanted to pay everyone was at our table, not always with the right checks but at our table nonetheless. That really sealed the deal. Glad you took the time out to make us so uncomfortable and unwanted so I could reflect it in your tip. \n\nBTW.

It is right next to the big screen tv/sports betting area and you can watch sports while you eat through the huge glass windows.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with their food.\n\nSchezuan Beef Noodle Soup- Very good! I like it just as much as the places in Rowland or SGV! Chewy noodles with a dark beefy soy/vinegary broth and lots of tender beef chunks. The only thing is i wish it had some MORE greens in it than the skimpy green onions. Perhaps some cilantro/onion and the chopped pickled mustard greens or bokchoy like the other places. Overall delicious but the soup gets hella salty towards the end be warned.\n\nSpicy Ying Nan Noodle Soup- NOT spicy at all. Tastes pretty bland. Its not seafood broth or chicken or beef broth. Can't really distinguish what the base taste is. Even with 2 generous scoops of Chili sauce it wasn't really spicy. I would skip this next time, however other people liked it.\n\nHot and Sour Soup- Loved it! I was wary since some reviews say it is not good but we liked it alot! Good balance of sour in my opinion and lots of toppings\n\nPho Special- $18 for a bowl of Pho better be good and it was according to my fellow Vietnamese diners! So if you can't make it to Pho Kim Long, here is a back up! (Another Pho back-up would be ordering the \"Zen Noodles\" at Grand Lux Cafe) \n\nOverall, i wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you staying in the Venetian and can't make it out to Chinatown but crave some asian food, Noodle Asia will do!"

The soups and the dishes definitely have an authenticity to it that make it feel like you're dining at a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in Chinatown in LA, NY, or San Francisco. But once you look at the prices and hear the sounds of slot machines start going off in the distance, you quickly realize that the Chinese restaurant you drunkenly stumbled your way into is inside the Venetian, on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThough the prices do suck, the food is definitely well worth it and should help sober you up, if you've had one too much to drink. The service can be hit or miss, and luckily for me, the service has been ok each time I've visited here."

Other bowls like the Wonton Noodle Soup and Curry Beef Brisket Noodle Soup were decent.  Across the board, be ready for the Vegas premium that cranks up the cost of everything by $3-5.  Service was fine though be aware that rice dishes can take much longer than the noodle soups (eg. my friend got his plate after everyone else had finished).

Our food came out much faster than my expectations and also exceeded my taste expectations!\nWe ordered the schezuan beef soup and chick mushroom vegetable soup which both hit the spot.

Yeah, most are that bad!  Overpriced, terrible attitude, small portion, terrible food.  The only exception is this one. They cannot compare to 626 or OC noodle shops but they do have the best quality on the strip.  More importantly, their staff are all very helpful and smiley.  The lady serving us took five minutes to explain most of their popular noodles, that was unheard of.  So even though this place is a little far from my hotel, I always make a point to go there.

They have the best porridge\", says my mother.  Coming from my mother who doesn't like rice porridge, I'll have to take her word for it.  So I made a plan to take a trip down to LV.  So last December, my husband and I drove all the way down to LV in my beat-up car.  We stayed for 3 nights and aside from several Vacation Ownerships we attended to get free shows and dinner, we also made a point to visit some of the newer casinos and attempt my luck at the casinos.  Noodle Asia came highly recommended and a MUST try per my mother's standard.  \n\nI had to search for the place since she really didn't remember the name except its the Chinese restaurant in The Venetian.  Being that this is the only one we saw that seems to serve porridge we tried it.  The place looked as messy and beat  up as my car but the hordes of people lining up and eating in this tiny place seems like a good sign.  We got a table after a few minutes.  We couldn't decide what to get so my husband ordered their fried rice and I got their porridge with beef and century egg.  The porridge was really good.  It seems bland at the beginning, probably because I was expecting it to totally blow me away but it grew on me until I couldn't resist not finishing the entire bowl.  \n\nIt was made simple but it reminded me of the time my Dad used to take me to Chinatown for a bowl of porridge.  It was delicious.  The service is like any other Chinese restaurant... always in a rush and hard to get them to notice you.  But after a few tries, we were able to get someone to put more water in our glass and finally get us our check.  I'll definitely go back just for the porridge alone but its not a place I'd keep craving for."

My favorite dish is this the siu chiu beef, crispy noodles with vegetables and black bean sauce.  I crave it even as I write.  The five spice tofu is excellent too, however good chance you may get bts later.  The cost is very reasonable for a Venetian restaurant.  Give it a try."

The soup was not the greatest. The servers over that weekend may have been a bit overwhelmed by the crush of people but ours was particularly mean. When we asked her what vegetarian options were available her answer initially was we have none and then she paused and said these two dishes are. Then my friend asked would it be possible to get these dishes just without the meat. Her response it will be the same price.... Thoughts that doesn't answer his question. He was polite and said that's ok. I just want it without the neat. Her response ok ok but still same price... Ok lady we get it. This all did not make a good impression on us. I would not recommend this place to anyone, however their iced coffee is delicious. If you like that sort of thing grab one to go while you explore the casino floor."

Some of the menu items had a description while others just listed their name. Now if I knew what they were this would be no issue but sadly I couldn't really figure out what to order and just ended up picking some random noodle dish with beef. I probably ordered cat, I honestly have no fucking clue!\n\nThe dish itself was delicious and I felt like I ate a portion that was easily made for 3-4 people. OOPS! It was a bit spicy but not to the point of crying, although there is nothing wrong with a few tears while dining. My friend swears by their shrimp fried rice so I tried some and wasn't blow away at all. If I closed my eyes I could have sworn I was in a panda express that added shrimp.

The service -- now on multiple occasions -- has been so bad, I had to take off one star. But imagine how good it is if I'm giving four stars for some of the worst service I've ever experienced!\n\nYes, it really is that good.\n\nThe funny story in all of this is that my wife and I were just wandering around looking for some breakfast on a lazy Saturday morning. Heavy breakfast at the Grand Lux? No thanks. Walk down to White Castle? Too far and too lazy. Then we saw the sign for Noodle Asia and thought that the idea of fried rice and pot stickers for breakfast sounded great! But when we walked up to the restaurant, we found out that it didn't open until 11 a.m. It was 10:30. So we sat down at a slot, lost $40, and then jumped up as others appeared ready to go to Noodle Asia.\n\nFirst in line, we were ready to eat. We were seated. And then...nothing. Others had their orders taken but we just sat. And sat. And sat. As food started coming out for others, our order was finally taken, just seconds before we were going to get up and leave. Then others were seated, their orders were taken, and their food was served. We still had nothing.\n\nIt wouldn't have been so bad if we hadn't had two cups of hot and sour soup. How hard would it be to simply ladle the soup into a cup and bring it to us?\n\nThe problem is that this isn't the first time we have received this treatment at Noodle Asia. On our previous trip to Las Vegas, we had another situation in which we were seated, and after 20 minutes, we got up and left. We actually asked two servers if our order could be taken and they said that they would be right back. But still, nothing.\n\nOnce the food arrived, however, it was all worth it. The hot and sour soup was, well, hot AND sour. What a concept! We also ordered the Night Market Fried Rice, which was a fried rice with sliced beef, Thai chilies, bean sprouts, basil, and diced tomatoes. Don't believe the menu that claims that this rice is spicy, but it is incredibly flavorful. The basil flavor lingers throughout each bite and the sliced beef is tender and delicious.\n\nThe Pot Stickers were the clear winner of the day. The dough is not that super-thin, frozen pot sticker style. Instead, it is thicker, creating a great crust where it was pan fried, but leaving a nice bite through the rest of the dough. The pork inside has a wonderfully light ginger flavor. I added a touch of what appeared to simply be soy sauce with green onions as well as some chili paste to give it a little kick. The result was a flavor explosion in my mouth that I have never tasted before. These are a must order.\n\nWe also tried the Red Won Tons, which were not quite as successful. These, which were also listed as spicy on the menu but were not, had pork fillings and were tossed in Szechwan Hung Yao chili and presented in garlic sauce. The pork tasted similar to the pork in the pot stickers, but the garlic sauce was incredibly oily and tasted almost burned, ending with an unpleasant texture and taste in my mouth.\n\nBut it was well worth it. And that was just the basics. I can't wait to get back and try some more!"

Two of us had Szechwan Beef Noodles and two of us had Spicy Ying Nan Rice Noodle. The food went beyond my expectations, everything being freshly prepared...the noodles had some zip. The open kitchen reinforced that freshly prepared concept.\n\nIt IS on the pricier side (i.e., compared to chinatown), but for us it was perfect. A quick, clean, hearty, not-too-greasy, late-night meal before heading out.\n\nI'll be back."

Besides that, they have less than 10 main dishes to choose from, and it's pretty much only the standard things my white friends always order - beef/chic broccoli, orange beef/chic, mongolian beef, etc. \n\nWe did a bunch of stuff for 6 family style. Things that were good: nothing. Things that were decent: fried rice, hot braised shrimp (aka sweet sour shrimp), siu mai. Things that were crap - everything else we ordered. Pass on the following: pot stickers, beef curry stew, kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, orange chicken, egg roll/spring rolls. Food was bland, and nothing \"spicy\" actually was despite the presence of chili peppers.\n\nIf you insist on staying here to have asian food, you can probably get comparable quality stuff for less from the panda express type place at the food court - think it's called wasabi jane?  It probably even includes mediocre fried rice and a stale egg roll with your meal. Or if you want a sit down experience, Zine at Palazzo is priced slightly more, but with a much better menu. I'm not a huge fan of their food either, but if you really must do overpriced chinese food at this hotel, Zine is the one to go for. \n\nAn asian food court is supposed to open at Palazzo off the casino floor eventually, so it's nice to know there are potentially better options coming soon."

So I was envisioning the yummy pan fried cantonese noodles from PF Chang's when I ordered this.   I was disappointed when the noodles were the thin vermicelli ones.  It def. was toasted on the outside which is fine, but the sauce was pretty flavorless.

I thought his rice with the sauce it came with was delicious though."

When I eat at any Asian food place, I am really driven by price. I guess it is because I know I can get good Asian food without breaking your wallet.

Go for dishes they actually have to stir-fry and cook.\n\nKnowing to skip large-batch menu items, we went with the mushroom chicken noodle soup and curry beef stew.  For both dishes, they'd be considered above average in Chinatown, and definitely fantastic in Vegas strip.  Case in point, when I had their wonton soup and shu mai, they felt store-bought and under-seasoned.  \n\nThere was one black mark during our visit - we ordered a Thai ice tea and they didn't have anymore.  But a few minutes later another waiter said they had one last cup - we happily accepted.  They added so much water to the Thai ice tea that it was a joke.  I found that to be shady.\n\nNevertheless stick with dishes that they HAVE to cook (and I don't mean fried rice), and you'll come away with a positive experience."

But if you don't feel like going to chinatown and you're craving some pretty decent asian noodle soup with actual asian dudes (*gasp) cooking in the open kitchen, then come to Noodle Asia."

The roast pork is ok but the duck and chicken's texture is weird. Almost like they were re-fried to make it crispy. The hoisin sauce is just out of place. \nThe curry pineapple seafood fried rice is pretty good. The rice is dry and the curry's aroma was apparent. \nThe black chicken soup is also decent. It is a good size enough for two."

It is completely open to the casino floor so it doesn't feel like a place where you can have a leisurely relaxing meal.  We had the red wontons, roast duck noodle soup and the pork chop noodle soup.  The wontons were a pricey appetizer, the soup broths were watery & bland, and the fried pork chop in my bowl of noodles was tough and dry.  Better noodle options can be found off the Strip on Spring Mountain Road."

Totally LEGIT.  The beef is super tender, the soup is spicy and flavorful and the noodles taste like they were made fresh that day.  My friends tell me that it's the best beef noodle soup they've had outside of Asia and I'm inclined to believe them.  It's certainly better than anything I've had in California.\n\nNoodle Asia is already open until 2am, but I wish they were open even later for post-clubbing drunken dining.

Of course flying in from the east coast, I was starving as I'm not a fan of most airport food unless I have no alternatives.\n\nI Yelped around for what might be open and I wanted something on the light side as I was exhausted and heading to bed after this.   Hmmm, what's open at 02:00 AM, and servers light food and was close to my location - Noodle Asia fit the bill. \n\nI walked up at 02:00 and was prompted greeted and seated.  I got a good feeling when there were quite a few Asian patrons who seemed like they were having a great meal present.  The place was not full, though not as empty as I expected for 02:00, but hey, this is Vegas. \n\nGiven I wanted to eat light, I had a bowl of soup -  Miso with Enoki Mushrooms Soup and a bowl of steamed Edamame.  The Edamame arrived quickly and had a nice scent of 5 spice and was salted perfectly.  they hit the spot while I waited for my soup to arrive! \n\nThe Miso was a great blend and adding the Enoki Mushrooms gave it just the right added texture and substance I was hoping for a lighter meal.  \n\nThey also had quite a few other noodle soups, rice dishes, wok noodles, and appetizers.  I did not see anything on the menu which looked outrageously priced - especially give you are in the Venetian!  In fact, given the quantity of food I received, these prices were in line with what I've had in San Francisco and other larger cities in similar locations. \n\nMy meal came to $13.  I was VERY pleased!  I will be trying to go back before I leave but if not, I will return the next time I'm in Vegas!"

The food is actually decent and is probably one of the most authentic Chinese food you can find directly on the strip.\n\nI've only ever ordered one thing: the beef noodle soup. Spicy, flavorful filled with beef & tendon, thin noodles and topped with some green onion and Taiwanese sour cabbage. For $14, it's a major rip off but it definitely hits the spot and it's so good that I can actually finish the whole bowl myself. I tried sharing once and.... let's just say ... THAT was a mistake. I have pretty high standards for beef noodle soup and I definitely like this one.\n\nSpeaking of mistakes, don't make this one. As an Asian person, I'm used to ordering a round of water or hot tea for everyone at the table. One time upon ordering tea, the waiter asked me \"how many cups for the tea? \" and I told him \"8, for everyone at the table.\" - also thinking.... don't you just bring a big pot of tea? ANYWAYS well, I was not informed that tea cost like $2-$3 PER CUP PER PERSON. So after he brought 8 cups and only 4 of us actually drank the tea.... but we still got charged for 8 cups of tea! So ridiculous!! Lesson learned.\n\nThey've also remodeled since I came last and it looks GREAT! Definitely looks more Vegas and gives a more modern/clean look. Service is ok, could be better.\n\nSober or drunk.... the beef noodle soup is good. 3.5 stars for good noodles, nice atmosphere and location in the Venetian and... good noodles."

There are seats positioned facing outward from the restaurant for precisely that purpose.

The bartender at the sports book next door agreed with me that Noodle Asia is the best restaurant at The Venetian.\n\nThe shu mai and har gow are fantastic.  I usually get a beef dish over rice (can't think of the name) that is my favorite.  The service is very fast.\n\nI have eaten here at least 10 times and never had a sub-par experience so I would have to say they are very consistent.  The only thing they have done consistently that I have laughed about is that they always forget to give me a pen to sign the check with.  When I ask for a pen, they always say \"not again\".  Oh well.  I am never in a hurry near 3am."

I saw the name of the place and thought to myself... really? Noodle Asia?\n\nGood thing I gave it a shot. My boyfriends and I weren't super hungry so we ordered an order of egg rolls and we split a BBQ Pork and Roast Duck noodle soup. Honestly I wasn't expecting much, but this place was pretty good. The broth was toned down for the American clientele, but it was still flavorful and rich. The BBQ Pork and the Roast Duck were so yummy. The egg rolls were just okay, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI will definitely be eating here again. I mean, you know the place is good when you go to an Asian restaurant and all you see are Asians eating there."

Only a few vegetables; bean sprouts, pickled cabbage and a few rehydrated mushrooms. Pork was in tiny tidbits, it looked like chicken, but apparently it was pork. Little to no flavor. Added soy sauce and chili paste for taste.\nBoyfriend had the Szechuan beef noodle soup which was extremely too hot. Beef was tasty, but broth had too much chili oil. Mixed some of my soup with his to cool his down and spice mine up!\nOverall it was fine. Maybe the other entrees are tastier?"

It was cooked very well and the noodles were cooked al dente. I think they gave some of the sour veggies on top, which was yummy as well.  ($13)\n- Pho:  I didn't try it, but the price was a whopping $15-17! (I forget the exact price.)\n\nSERVICE (3/5):  I'm a little surprised that Noodle Asia had a hostess who didn't know a lick of English. She had asked us to clear some space in the front and she said, \"Back to go.\"  We didn't understand what she wanted and she seemed very flustered and angry (at herself?).  When a few people came to the front to ask how long the wait was, she didn't seem like she wanted to answer because they had asked in English.  The service in the restaurant wasn't too great either-- it was exactly what I had expected from a Chinese restaurant. However, since we were paying an arm and a leg for something that typically costs $6-8 in California, and since we were in Las Vegas, I was expecting better service.  At least some refill on tea and water... but we didn't get any of that type of service, and we got the same \"rushed, stony-faced, no 'thank you'\" service that we got at Sam Woo (in Chinatown). Haha.  I would still come back though. The venue and service are nothing to write home about, but the beef noodle soup definitely hit the spot for me.\n\nWAIT:  We wanted for about 20 minutes and there were about 7 parties ahead of us. The good thing is that the line moved decently fast-- people get their noodles and dishes quickly, chomp it down, and then leave for more Vegas fun.  When I called at 12 pm, the person who picked up the phone said the wait was 1 hour.  O_O  \n\nVENUE:  Venetian / First Floor (in Casino)."

The busser spilled hot water all over my back and my coat that was resting on the back of the chair. Instead of apologizing or helping to clean he pretended like nothing happened and walked away. We then told the waitress and she didnt seem to care at all either. She was actually more concerned about cleaning the floor so no one trips and sues them than to apologize or help me dry my shurt or coat. If i ever come back it will definitely be to go."

The restaurant is right next to the sportsbook and casino floor. I was skeptical at first \"probably commercialized tasting..\" But they proved me very wrong.\n\nour 3 consecutive orders:\n\nSmall Cantonese BBQ Plate ( bbq pork only): Even the small could feed quite a few people. Served as rectangular slices, tender, juicy and their sauce was Awesome. When I want bbq pork (chinese style) I usually make a run to Sam Woo in China town. But I must say, I would drive the extra miles and walk the extra steps from the self park or valet, to have Noodle Asia's bbq pork any day!! One of the best I've had! \n\nCantonese Sausage Fried Rice: I love the fact that it Comes with Egg Whites. They also add really thin slices of chinese broccoli that gives the dish a little snap to it. Not only does this simple dish have tremendous flavor, nice soft and crunch texture, it was visually appealing!! (Think X'mas Fried rice: White Rice, like snow.. Chinese sausage, red in color.. Chinese broccoli, green in color..) One of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had! By the way I'm Filipino, I live off rice and have had Many Many different variations of it..\n\nHong Kong Wonton: Broth very light flavor, noodles thin (like angel hair pasta) and wontons are typical but satisfying. A nice way to start off a meal. \n\nordered once:\n\nRoast Duck: rich duck flavor, meat's consistency like chicken and skin abosorbed the sauce. Tasty!\n\nSzechwan Beef noodle soup: dark clear broth, had a spicy note to it but did not linger. Beef were cut into good sized cubes, meat soaked in the wonderful broth flavors and were filling. Thick noodles went perfect with the meat. \n\nPrices are a bit Steep, Service is Good and Food a Solid 4 Stars! Lesson Learned, Not to Judge a Book by its Cover! May not be totally Authentic but their refined take on the food was definitely a positive one!"

Vermicelli with shrimp in a chicken broth with chili paste. That's according to the menu; according to my bowl, we also had scallops and other random fish.  So flavorful!\n-XO Shrimp Lai Fen: Rice noodles, with perfectly cooked, plump shrimp in an XO spicy sauce.

Shamefully, it was just the wife and myself. \n\nIt shouldn't be a surprise that the prices here are sky high, but you just have to take one glance around and realize that the restaurant is inside the Venetian hotel on the Strip. You might do a double-take and see that yes, it's around $10-$13 for porridge, or $10 for wonton soup. Basically, whatever prices you're used to, just multiply by 2 for this place.\n\nWe ordered a wide assortment of dishes:\n\nSeafood crispy pan fried noodles\nWonton soup\nSeafood rice porridge\nVegetable spring rolls\nSoy milk\n\nI honestly thought everything was comparable to what I've had at like a Sam Woo cafe or something like that. Just double the price. Just good 'ol Chinese comfort food. Our total bill was $50. Pretty shocking, I know. Would I eat here if the food wasn't comp'd? Not a million years.

But after 30 minutes of waiting in line and watching the servers completely fumbling over each other - they were clearly inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing, I knew we were doomed.  But we had already waited that long so we stayed.  From the line, I watched table after table trying to flag someone down because they wanted to pay.  No one would come to them.  I look over to see where the servers are and all four servers, standing together near the cash register looking completely flustered.  Meanwhile, there is a gigantic line outside, which is continuing to grow, and tables are empty and cleared and no one is coming to address the customers waiting in line.  Finally, after about 40 minutes, the man in front of me started to get annoyed obviously by seeing pretty much half the restaurant clear out and no one being seated so he walks in to the four servers standing around the cash register and says something to them.  Finally, one server comes and takes that man and his friend and seats them at the counter.  Then she goes back to standing there - like deer in headlights.  Good grief. Then it was my turn to flag the girl down and tell her that I am happy to sit at the counter as there are empty chairs.  When I tell her that, then she seats us, finally.   I have no idea how long the others continued to wait outside. \n\nOnce at the counter, we ordered, two noodle soup dishes.  it was pretty uneventful and unflavorful.  Maybe it was what I ordered, or maybe it was because they were so busy that they were rushing and not preparing food properly.  \n\nWe ate here because we watched Rock of Ages at the Venetian.

My dad said the flavor was good , but my mom preferred my hot and sour soup better. There were lots of chicken and mushroom bits in the soup and it was hot (temperature). \n\nThe Chinese broccoli was excellent, the sauce wasn't generously drizzled on the broccoli which we preferred. The dish was a hit and i would've ordered that again if i came the next time.\n\nThe Shrimp dumpling (dim sum) was good, but not worth the price. It came lukewarm or not even warm. The dumplings were sticking with each other. but, nonetheless it was food. \n\nHot and sour soup was a hit for my mom and I. I liked it , there were lots of flavor and it gave a kick (spicyness).  I would order this again, but for 5 bucks for a cup is SUPER EXPENSIVE. the cup was not a big cup..so get a bowl if you're hungry. \n\nthe jelly fish was a slight dissapoint out of all the dishes we tried. It lacked flavor and it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it. \n\nOverall, we had a good experience, it's legit chinese food that I missed while staying at LV. Definitely not like LA , but its vegas and food is not cheap. I still would come back and try their spicy beef noodle soup. yum!"

The beef itself is cooked so perfectly that it's so tender!  Just this one time visit has had me wanting to come back for more.  It is now a forever staple for every visit to come, and it is not only delicious, but also absolutely heavenly after a night of too much drinking.

The beef noodle soup comes out piping hot, and the broth has just the perfect amount of spice. The chunks of beef are soft and exude flavor, and the noodles are great. LOVED it!! It's also perfect for hangovers... just saying. Definitely want to make this one of our stops on our many Vegas excursions."

Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.\n\nShitty service, but it didn't matter when we got our bowls. The waitress took our orders and requests, but that was it .

Boyfriend & I shared the Szechuan Beef noodle soup, and our friend ordered the wonton noodle soup I think. He really liked his soup, and ours was delicious!! I was kinda worried bc it was supposed to be spicy, but it was just right! It warmed me up without making me reach for everyone's ice water! The beef was also super tender, yummy! \n\nPrice was a lil high, but hey, it's in the Venetian! And it wasn't anything more than you'd find at a pricey Asian place in any other city, so overall not too shabby!

I ordered the Won Ton soup (no noodles), and it was slightly bland but soothing.  The won tons were really good, though I wish they didn't have shrimp in them since I'm allergic.

I was skeptical at first, and maybe a little drunk too, since we had just come from a pool party. I was exhausted and beyond hungry, so the first time I ever had Noodle Asia's Beef Noodle Soup, I was sold. It was ridiculously good and it definitely hit the spot. Ever since my first time here in the Summer of 2012, I've kept coming back.\n\nI've tried their other dishes (only because someone else orders it haha) such as minced beef over rice, duck over rice, pepper chow mein and potstickers all are very good but nothing compares to their beef noodle soup! It's so hot with a hint of spiciness to it. The beef is tender and oh, the bits of fat connected to the beef is the best! I crave this soup when I'm back in SF. I wish I could have some right now.\n\nIt's a bit pricey because it's probably the only asian restaurant on the strip but it's sooo worth it!"

The roast duck pieces had nothing but skin on them.  Absolutely no meat.  Maybe they saw that I was an Asian guy and they felt that I had enough roast duck in my lifetime and know how it taste like so they are saving it for those that might not have tried it before.  COMPLETELY understand (not really)!  The bbq pork was BRIGHT pinkish/red which almost blinded me.  I think they glazed it intensely, which actually was not too bad.  The rice was eh...rice.

Maybe I don't really like soy but I didn't love the flavor of these. It was very unusual for chinese food (to me) and I wasn't crazy about it. Mine was much better although very generic and Americanized. It was tasty - but not of super high-caliber quality. The food was definitely filling and the portions were big - we were hoping to take this back to our room but unfortunately the Bellagio did not have a fridge in our room to store our leftovers. \n\nI can't recall the final price of our lunch but remember thinking it was pretty expensive for what it was. If you're looking for something other than bar food, I MIGHT recommend it if you can't find anywhere else to go. And with the millions of options on the strip, I'm sure you could find a better place than this."

I ordered a Spicy Ying Nan Noodle soup bowl which consisted of vermicelli and shrimp enveloped in a scrumptuous chicken broth with Ying Nan chili paste, scallions and cilantro. The broth was fresh, and overall, it wasn't too spicy. The noodles were smooth and tasted great when they slid down my alcohol ravaged throat. Although the dish was slightly overpriced at $14, it tasted good and believe it or not, I would come back again to try out some of the other dishes!\n\nThis place is good for large groups and it is an excellent choice if you happen to be staying at the Venentian."

Needless to say, this place doesn't play around when it comes to Chinese food.  Tab bit overpriced in my opinion for what you get simply because the protein almost drowned out by the carbs.  Granted I enjoy my carbs, just not too much.  Also, is it me or do I need to drink a lot of water after a meal here?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's salty!

Tucked in the back of the Venetian next to the sports betting area, you can certainly grab some cheaper fare, but it's still a bit pricey overall.\n\nI had a bowl of the spicy beef noodle soup (~$15-$16), but it was only a-okay. Beef was all the tendon pieces, so there was actually very little pieces of \"meat.\" The broth was also incredibly oily, so I wouldn't recommend this dish if you have an overly sensitive stomach. The noodles themselves were great though - I thought they were a good chewy consistency, but they were drowned out by the \"average-ness\" of the broth and the sub-par beef cuts.\n\nService (3/5)\nNothing crazy here. It's traditional wait staff, but they're SUPER attentive in filling up your water, so that was nice.\n\nAtmosphere (4/5)\nNoodle Asia goes ALL OUT on the \"Chinese\" decor. Red color abounds the dining area, and ginormous versions of traditional Chinese charms adorn the walls.\n\nWhat's super cool about Noodle Asia is the floor-to-ceiling glass windows so you can have a great view to the sports betting area (aka: the jumbo-sized screens showing all the latest sports games). It's almost like getting front-row seats to the betting area but without spending the $$$ to get a spot.\n\nOverall, Noodle Asia is only okay. It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst. It's a much needed reprieve from Vegas's $50 buffets in terms of dollar savings and not over-indulging in gluttony. Honestly though, I'm not sure if I'd come back since there are way too many delicious food options on The Strip but it's definitely a convenient restaurant option if you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo."

Both the Pork and Duck were really dry, and of course served with some even drier rice.  Another problem is the rice to meat ratio. You can tell this restaurant does not care about details or quality when they just shoved about 3 bowls of rice onto a plate topped with a couple pieces of meat. I'm not complaining about the meat, I would have rather they  not give me a bunch of rice which I am not going to eat. I am Asian and when you eat meat with your rice you usually take a bite of the meat, and a spoonful of rice. Well that's what I did (the meat and rice were very dry I had to drink a cup of water after each bite) and I did not even finish half the rice, not even a quarter.\n\nVery disappointed, wasn't worth the 30 minute line outside for food I could have gotten at a chain Chinese restaurant."

This is something they absolutely excel in. The jook is creamy and insanely perfect. Portions are huge too so you might want to share that.\n\nThe Cantonese items are all fantastic including \"gon chow ngau hor\" the beef chow fun, or the soups like the ginger chicken double boiled soup, also fabulous.\n\nBut move towards the more northern Chinese selections and things start going south. For instance, the noodles soup with preserved mustard greens and pork -- below average! The noodles were so doughy it made the broth muddy and not clear.\n\nThe ma po tofu was dismal -- no flavor and the chile used was incorrect.\n\nOne of our friends ordered the moo shu vegetables which she said was delicious -- it looked good, but I didn't try it.\n\nSo stick with the Cantonese offerings and stay away from the rest. Service was okay on all of our visits."

It has a good amount of kick and the brisket has been braised long enough so it's tender.  Portion's a little small but it is always satisfying.\n\nIf you like rice, YangChow fried rice is the way to gooo.  You can definitely tell that it's been wok-ed in a super hot wok and oil glistens on every rice kernel.  Lots of BBQ pork and diced veggies.  You can even make it spicy if you request it!\n\nAs for other noodles, black pepper beef udon is great if you love peppery flavors.  It's not black pepper sauce that you see from most cafes in LA but actual cracked black pepper.  Shanghai noodles has a little bit of curry powder in it and loaded with shrimp and other goodies.  Of course can't go wrong with the wonton soup either.  \n\nFor me, I'm just really surprised at how... authentic or as authentic as it can be.  I mean, it sits right next to the casino and the sports book.  Usually spots like these are reserved for a crappy deli or something.  Definitely nice to have something like this when you've had Grand Luxe so many times!\n\nIt is a bit overpriced and be prepared to wait around noon, dinner, or late night.  It's not a big place!"

There were dirty napkins on the ground, there was hairs on the table and plates. It was just bizarre how much of a bad first impression we were getting from this place, but for some reason we still decided to stay. We were quickly given drinks and the plates with hair were replaced which we were all happy with. We also ordered pretty quickly and everything was starting to get a little bit better.  About 15 minutes after we order the waitress essentially says that they can't cook the rice my younger sibling ordered because it'll take too long for them.  My sister didn't want anything besides that so she just got an order of the jasmine rice.\nWe ordered 3 appetizers: the edamame came first and it was honestly the worst edamame I've ever had.

I ordered the pork and century egg congee, it was disappointing!  The egg pieces tasted moldy, and I had had this before in other places, and the century egg did not taste like this.  I ordered lemon because i like eating it with congee, and the server gave me lime instead.  Not the same thing!  Service was not that attentive. Sorry, I definitely would not recommend this restaurant."

I'm not feeling too well and the weather doesn't make it any better. I was in deep need of soup.\n\nI started to think of where I could possibly walk to on the strip that had noodle soup and luckily enough -- I saw the Venetian map where someone already pulled up the restaurant options, and low and behold: Noodle Asia! \n\nI could not have been anymore happier than in that moment.\n\nUpon arriving, right on their stand was their special for the day \"Convention Special\" featuring 8 curry fish balls, won ton noodle soup AND Vietnamese coffee.\n\nI was like \"ok, now I'm more sold and more in love\".\n\nNow about the food: BEST WON TONS I'VE EVER HAD. EVER. Even the noodles were amazing and I'm not usually a fan of yellow noodles. Broth was good too, but as usual I had to add chili paste to it -- only because I love spicy -- it could have been a great soup without it.\n\nI'm a big Vietnamese coffee fan and this I loved too! \n\nNow I don't have much to say about the curry fish balls only because I'm actually not a fan personally of curry fish balls. Curry alone -- I love. Fish balls alone -- I love. But I just can't get the two to go well in my mout together.\n\nAnyways -- great portions. They have a bar so people eating by themselves can be seated quickly. I'm super stuffed.\n\nNow I must leave because I'm done eating and the line is getting long."

But creatures of habit as we are, we always stick to the same dishes... can't miss right.  And they're always excellent.  \n\nSpicy Scezchuan beef soup... it's got some serious kick but so flavorful.  Yes spicy, but with the proper ratio of flavors.  \n\nPai Goo noodles, which is basically a pork chop with noodles... Simple, tasty, and very fresh.\n\nSpicy cucumbers... accompaniment of some fresh veggies.\n\nCongee... all very tasty.  Again, comfort food with great flavors.\n\nAll the above tend to be on the somewhat lighter, brothy side.  Would love to try some of the other dishes, like any of the fried noodles.  And yes, as the name implies why wouldn't i?  Well, bc it's all pretty damn greasy and as tasty as that may sound, and as much as i like not having to put on any lip gloss, it's just all way too heavy.  And i think that's where some of the negative reviews might come in.\n\nService was solid, not 5 star Fancy LV restaurant, but yunno, it's a $13/bowl of noodle level of service.  \n\nIt is however, clean.  And fast.  Fresh.  Tasty.    So, basically, it's what most of us want in a good chinese restaurant that is unbelievably difficult to find.   Very affordable, fresh, tasty, comfort food, in a clean setting.   Trust me, that ain't easy when it comes to Chinese food."

I shared the Crab Rangoon with my friends and ordered the Spicy Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup. Crab Rangoon was good.

Ingredients wasn't anything too spectacular, just the usual shrimp and veggies. I ended up eating only half of the portion.  Food isn't extremely great, it's better presentation than regular Chinese food places. Taste is there, pretty standard. But my dish wasn't spicy at all, which was  a disappointment in that sense. When I see \"Spicy\" and a chili pepper symbol next to the menu item, I want some kick in it. \n\nThey do charge for tea.

Way to make us feel welcome and valued as paying customers. \n\nSo we ordered the Beef Stew Noodle and the Spicy Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup. Wasn't expecting much, how authentic could it be on the strip? But, I was pleasantly surprised! \n\nSpicy Yunnan: The noodles were a good consistency, the shrimp was plump, and the broth was hot and delicious. \n\nBeef Noodle: The noodles were a bit too doughy and the broth was bland but the beef was really tender. \n\nIf you are stuck on the strip, come here. But if you have a car, get out of the hotel and drive 5 minutes to Chinatown where you can find better food at better prices. We ended up paying ~$30 for two entrees. I could buy 3-5 better tasting noodle plates elsewhere! Good food, but the prices and the impatient service won't be bringing me back."

Long lines are usually an encouraging sign at a restaurant so we decided to join the crowd. \n\nIf it is available on the menu, then I tend to be a creature of habit by ordering Kung Pao Chicken at practically every Asian restaurant I visit. This restaurant was no different. In a way, it's my barometer for judging Asian cuisine. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with their Kung Pao Chicken at all. The chicken was tough and dry while the sauce was clumpy and somewhat syrupy.  The texture to this sauce reminded me of melted caramel and not the typical thin Kung Pao sauce. The taste was mostly sweet and tangy rather than spicy. A strange taste for a Kung Pao dish.  It just was not enjoyable.  On the other hand, the shrimp stir fried noodles, potstickers, and won ton soup were great. My wife and I were really pleased with all these noodle dishes and how they were cooked, steamed and fried to perfection. All the vegetables, seafood and meat in these dishes were fresh and delicious. The cabernet sauvignon was a perfect complement to wash down all these dishes. \n\nThe service here was excellent.  We were constantly checked on and asked if we needed anything. I would also like to thank the hostess for seating my wife and I at a table that faced the sportsbook so I could continue to watch the football games without any interruption while enjoying our meal. \n\nI am giving Noodle Asia three stars because they failed my Kung Pao Chicken test but excelled with the noodle dishes and service."

The previous day, I was sightseeing, walking through the casino, and NA caught my eye!  They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O. \n\nI came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area. \n\nMy server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the \"Pho Prime\".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)\n\nThe Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...\n\nOverall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.  I gave them 3 stars because of No Hoisin sauce and out of 3 desserts, or else I would have given a 5 star review.   Just a weird experience to run out of certain things on a Monday right around opening 11am, but it's all good, I am guessing they had a crazy busy weekend.  I left fulfilled and satisfied that I got my Pho ;)"

Maybe I ate here at the wrong time, totally sober, and fresh off of the airplane.  My hunger was satisfied, and I must have liked it to a degree, as my plate was pretty much clean, but reflecting back on it, my experience was simply, ok.  \n\nThere was a total of 6 guys that I went with, and we each got different things, so I was able to sample a couple of things other than what I'd ordered.  Shanghai Noodles was my choice.  It's a dish of wok-fried noodles with napa cabbage and pork.  The plate looked and smelled good, but the noodles were truly too oily.  I honestly couldn't help but think of Michael Jackson's 1980's jheri curl, so I suppose I can say that the noodles were straight up greasy.  However, one of the guys at my table got beef congee.  It had that nice thick porridgey texture that I love, not watery, as I've experienced at too many other establishments.  Also, the beef was tender, which I previously thought was impossible in a soup.  \n\nThough the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.  It is one of the \"casual\" dining spots in The Venetian, so don't expect a meal to write home about.  However, as I hinted earlier, if you're in need of balancing your liquid-to-solid ratio, after boozing, then head on over there."

Took them a while to take our orders and bring water out too even though the place doesn't look too packed.\n\nFood: authentic quality. When the server finally brought the food out. I was like \"Big bowl of delicious hot soup, welcome to my tummy!\" I ordered the Spicy Ying Nan Noodles (4 stars  for taste) and my friends had the HK Wonton soup. They also enjoyed their big bowls of soups a lot. I should have tried a bit for a taste review. The portion was generous. My empty stomach was satisfied to be filled with liquid other than alcohol. Heh heh. The soup was already spicy, but I slapped on more chili to unclog my sinuses.\n\nOverall, the soup made me feel a lot better. Honestly, nothing beats comfort Asian food after all. After digesting that bowl of soup, I was ready to take on another day at Sin City. Why the 3 stars then? Because the poor college student in me is very bitter at paying 2 times the prices of what the bowl of soup really is worth..."

Usually at other major hotels, you get all the ching chong ling long bells and whistles with big gigantic dragons and red and gold walls everywhere and bastardized noodles.  Rest assured this place actually feels like a classy hole in the wall.  I'm not sure how they achieved that but it's been done.\n\nThe spicy beef noodle soup tastes great.  Fat chunks of beef and the noodles are quite chewy.  But if paying a lot for NRM isn't your thing ($14 a lot)...and if you have a car, then you better run over to China town LV."

The food was pretty authentic for Asian food on the strip and it was delicious. They even had fresh coconut juice! Service was pretty good as well, fast and friendly. \n\nWe ordered some Dim Sum items, Braised Beef Noodle Soup, and Fried Rice. It was all tasty and very affordable. For the reviews that say it's too pricey here... I disagree. Its hard to find Asian food on the strip this authentic and affordable. They also give you hella big portions! \n\nDelicious, authentic, affordable and opened late? Can't beat that."

Perhaps its the the \"AM\" time which was getting to him.  However the female manager who came by to serve our food was very pleasant, and indeed a cutie with a twinkle in her winkle lol.....\n\nI had the night market fried rice 4/5: sliced beef tossed in thai chilli, basil, bean sprouts, and diced tomatos was yumm!! perfect balance of flavors, however the beef slices could have been smaller.  Each slice was half a mouthful lol...\n\nBBQ Pork & Duck Noodle Soup 2/5: Barely any duck, and a few slices of bbq pork, the presentation was great, but honestly not worth it.\n\nFu Chow Fried Rice 3/5: presentation, taste, and portion was bang on! lots of shrimp, chicken, mushroom, calamari, and scallion gravy...worth it!!\n\nOverall the quality of the dishes were below my expectations.

I wouldn't say this restaurant is Asian fusion, as it's more \"authentic\" than the likes of let's say PF Changs and Hakasaan, but like I asked the waiter what type of noodles were the beef rice noodles and he said they were like chow fun.  So I dedcied to go with the beef rice noodle but asked for it gravy style instead of the dry version.  I was surprised that they were actually the thinner rice noodle (not super thin like vermicelli, but Chinese chow fun noodles are thicker than the noodles I got).  While the noodles were slightly thinner and the gravy wasn't 100% like what I get back at Chinese restaurants back home, Noodle Asia serves up some good, comforting Asian food.  The quality of the ingredients were a little better than typical Chinese restaurants as well.  The spicy wontons were a favorite and my chow fun was huge enough to serve up to 3 people, or one really hungry friend plus me (he helped me out in addition to his entree).  My \"chow fun\" was $15, which, yes you can get half off off the strip, but, first off, if I couldn't even make it to Cosmo, then there was no way I was going to make it off the strip, and 2 it's expected to be pricier as it's on the Strip.  \n\nService was pretty good, minus a slightly older lady with RBF and major attitude when I asked for change, and for two cards to be charged a certain amount.  3.5 rounded up."

Food came, you asked for a bowl and took another century to come and had to physically tackle the server on the other table. You wait some more and the bowl was probably still in the factory.

We ordered Ha Cao and Xiu Mai from Dim Sum. The Xiu Mai came out pipping hot. It was VERY good. All of us love it very much. \nWe then waited soooooooo long for the Ha Cao to come out. The Ha Cao was Okay in my opinion. The shrimps inside were very fresh and cooked just perfect; however, the skin outside was a lil over-cooked, so it was kinda powdery and a lil bit mashed. The good Ha Cao skin should be a bit chewy. \n\nWe then waited very long again for our noodles to come out. 2 wonton noodle soups for my cousins came out first. And about 5 minutes later, my wonton soup came out. i seriously don't understand why it took them longer to make my wonton soup while mine was exactly like my cousins' wonton noodle soups without the noodles. It didn't make any sense to me. But anyway, the soup was very good. The broth is clear. Wonton seemed to be freshly made. I tried the noodles from my cousin, and they were cooked just right. Very good. \n\nThe other 2 girls ordered spicy beef noodle soups. The beef was very tender. Lots of meat also. They like it. \n\nService meets standard. The place looks clean and modern which is no surprise because it is located in the Venetian :)\n\nThis is definitely a good place for soups without going anywhere far. I would recommend Noodle Asia to open 24/7 if they haven't done so because apparently after getting out of XS at 4am, all we think about is a bowl of soup (if you're still awake enough to think)"

However, msg overload as it was way too salty and I drank several cups of tea and water during my meal. \n\nDon't waste your time or $ on the pork and duck egg congee... Meh.\n\nMy gf ordered one of the chicken noodle soups and it was uber plain, don't recommend that either."

I come to Vegas for a hot steamy bowl of chewy noodles, tender chunks of beef, and a deep, dark, bold, spicy broth. \n\nWhile yes, at $13.95 for a bowl of Taiwanese soup is quite steep and may leave many wondering where the \"happy ending\" went; but, rest assured, the happy ending came.

When I got my dish, I didn't think it was worth $12 to be honest but then I guess it's food on the Strip so it's overpriced lol. The wontons were made of shrimp and pork I believe. The noodles were so soggy and there was barely any broth because our to go food was just sitting at the counter and not given to us when it was ready.

There was a long line but it moved very fast. \n++ Really liked the modern Asian decor. \n\nThe bad:\n-- Very few (3 or 4) vegetarian options.\n-- Quite pricey. 2$ for a teeny bowl of rice.

I want to go back again just for this!  YUM!  You definitely won't be disappointed if you get it.  It's a very big portion size (think big big soup bowl) - I think you'd be good if you shared this and then ordered another entree.  Or just eat it on it's own!  The beef and the noodles will help fill you up.  We also ordered fried rice just to mix it up a little and try something else...but it was unremarkable.\n\nMy only problem with the restaurant - if you drink the water, you can definitely taste the oils/residue from the other food probably because all the dishes are washed together...GROSS!  I'd bring a separate bottle of water since you'll get thirsty.  :P"

We checked into the Venetian around lunchtime, so by the time we were settled in our room we were quite hungry.  I had looked at the dining book in the room and I saw that Noodle Asia had vegetarian dishes, so we decided to go there.\n\nThere was an extremely long wait to get seated - and there were only three parties ahead of ours (one of which had 6 people, the others were couples).  It also took a very long time to get anything to drink and to have our order taken; this was at lunchtime so perhaps they were understaffed.  Fortunately the food arrived quickly after we ordered it, and when we were ready to leave, my doggie bag was brought quickly.\n\nI was quite disappointed in the food, however.  When a restaurant is specifically advertised as having multiple vegetarian dishes, I expect them to be either marked with an icon or in their own section - but here, I had to ask the hostess to explain what dishes on the menu were vegetarian.  There were not many of them, although she claimed that a few could be \"made vegetarian\" by leaving out meat.  (I am always skeptical of this, because very often they use beef broth anyway.)  I ordered the Buddha's Feast noodles and my partner ordered the Shanghai Noodles; hers were much better than mine.\n\nThe atmosphere at Noodle Asia is not good at all.  It's mostly sheltered from the casino, but wide-open to the sports book.  I did not enjoy staring at 87 TV's showing all kinds of sports while I ate.\n\nIf you are already at the Venetian and craving Asian food, but you can't afford Tao, then Noodle Asia is not too bad.  But otherwise, I'd stay far away from this restaurant."

They said they really wanted a hot bowl of noodle soup. There wasn't a lineup so we got seated really quickly. It took them a while to bring us tea. In fact, my dad had to ask the waiter for it. I wouldn't say the waiter was super friendly and attentive. While he was taking our orders, he was just looking at other tables, which I find was unprofessional.\n\nThe menu has a big variety of dishes ranging from congee to noodle soup, from fried rice to dim sum, etc. It took me a little while to decide what I wanted because there were a lot of dishes that I like. I finally decided to try their Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup (\u725b\u8169\u9eb5). My sister ordered their Fish Filet congee (\u9b5a\u7247\u7ca5) because she wasn't feeling well and congee is easier to digest. My mom ordered their Snow Cabbage with Enoki Mushroom and Fried Tofu Noodle Soup (\u96ea\u83dc\u91d1\u91dd\u83c7\u8c46\u8150\u6e6f\u9eb5). My dad and my parents' friends all opted for their Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (\u5ddd\u5473\u7d05\u71d2\u725b\u8089\u9eb5). I wanted to order the beef noodle soup but I was scared it would be too spicy so I didn't get it.\nMy Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup (\u725b\u8169\u9eb5) came with wonton noodles (also called wanton mee). Some people, like my mom, dislike the flavor of this kind of noodle but I'm fine with it. I liked how the texture of this noodle is firmer and thus, chewier. The dish came with only 2 baby bok choy... I definitely would enjoy more vegetables here. The beef stew was flavorful but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I didn't like the fact that half of my portion of meat was just fat. I was expecting more tendons and meat for the price I paid (pay $15 USD). They also cut the meat in small pieces, which made it seem like there were a lot of mean in this bowl. \n\nMy sister's Fish Filet congee (\u9b5a\u7247\u7ca5) congee was pretty good but definitely not worth the price considering the amount of fish filet she had. It was just a decent bowl of congee but nothing too special about it.\n\nMy mom's Snow Cabbage with Enoki Mushroom and Fried Tofu Noodle Soup (\u96ea\u83dc\u91d1\u91dd\u83c7\u8c46\u8150\u6e6f\u9eb5) was.... I don't even know how to describe it. It definitely didn't look like what she had imagine! It looked really messy with enoki and cabbage all spread out and floating around... It originally came with wonton noodles but since my mom doesn't like this kind of noodle, she exchanged it for Lai Fun (\u7028\u7c89). This bowl of noodle soup didn't taste bad but definitely not worth its price considering there wasn't a piece of meat and all the ingredients are not expensive at all...\n It seems like their Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (\u5ddd\u5473\u7d05\u71d2\u725b\u8089\u9eb5) is a must there but you will be quite disappointed, especially if you've had the beef noodle soup from Asia or Taiwan before! It is just not comparable!! It was tasteful but still lacking flavor as compared to any of the beef noodle soup restaurants in Taiwan. I highly suggest anyone to visit Taiwan because this country is a food heaven!\n\nIn short, there aren't many Asian restaurants on Las Vegas Strip, if you are tired of Panda Express and would like something classier (conveniently located inside The Venetian Hotel, on the same level as their casino and beautifully decorated) and more expensive, Noodle Asia is the place to go! I don't think the price justified the quantity and quality of their food but it was nonetheless a satisfying meal for us."

This is one of those very few.  We had Hot and Sour Soup, Stir Fried Soft Noodles with BBQ Pork, Mu Shu Pork, Chicken Pineapple Fried Rice, Brocolli Beef. Not the best Chinese food I've had, definitely, but solid, good Chinese food.  The beef in the broccoli beef was a bit fatty so I wouldn't recommend that one.  Best of all, portions were large enough for the 3 adults and two teens to share family style and we were stuffed with a little leftovers at the end.  And for The Strip, prices were very reasonable - most in the $13-17 range so with beverages (two of them alcoholic) the bill for the 5 of us was under $100 (not including tip.) Practically unheard of on the strip for in-hotel semi-upscale dining.  Service was good too, although the place was only about 1/3 full when we ate there so YMMV.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is semi-upscale casual and it's in the casino with a nice view of the screens in the sport book through huge glass windows so bonus you can watch the game(s) while eating.

The others I've tried are Noodles at Bellagio and Beijing Noodle #9 at Caesars.\n\nIt seems like we always go here on a late Friday night after coming from the airport.  The dishes I've had have all been really good.  The noodles in the Szechwan Beef are amazing..  really fresh.  The Chicken Stir-Fried Soft Noodles are pretty good.  Probably my favorite is the Buddha Feast Pan-Toasted Noodles.  My gf gets it all the time cuz it's vegetarian, but you can add meat (I like mine with chicken..  it comes out to be the same price as the Chicken Stir-Fried Soft Noodles).  Every time I get something other than that, I end up wishing I'd just gotten it instead.\n\nNoodles at Bellagio also has pan-toasted noodles.  I think they call it Hong Kong style noodles, or Cantonese noodles, or something like that.  I don't know whether it was a fluke, but contrary to Noodle Asia's, they were gross.  Extremely salty.  Like salty enough for your mouth to feel like it's getting too much salt, and for you to wonder whether your blood pressure will be adversely affected by it.  blech.\n\nBack to Noodle Asia.  They run a tight ship.  Service is prompt and good.  You can see them cooking your food.  The food is good.  It might seem a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it I think.  All around an excellent place."

Have the roast duck for the appetizer, The beef Szechuan soup and beef chow fun for the entr\u00e9es. The soup was outstanding and the roast duck was very good. The chow fun was good but pretty typical that you could find that most Chinese restaurants. A little pricey but hey it's the Venetian. \n\n\nEnjoyed the food so much we went back to days later. Have haw gau and the potstickers for the appetizers. They were excellent. Also had the Singapore noodles and the soup noodles with roast duck and Chau Sui. Both very good. \n\nWould recommend this place."

I must admit, from the menu items I have tried, they are all pretty decent except for the soup, especially the Egg Flower Soup. The soup tasted worse than the imitation Egg Flower Soup at a Chinese buffet. I was a big fan of the Sze-Chuan Beef Noodle and the Ba Bao noodles though, just not the price tag.

In one year, there were over 100 servers or busers got the job and quit, Why? Bad management! Does a server care to give good customer service when he/she does not feel love from the company? Who care to give a F when they are only consider as a Workers? Here comes a true story, it was the first day for a new buser, after over 4 hours non stop working, time for him to take a break and dinner, he found a dish of fried rice sat in the kichen for over 2 hours due to a special order made wrong, he microwaved it and started eating since only 30 mins break time. The manager on duty found that out, she gave the buser two options: pay for the dish and keep the job, or take the uniform off and leave immediately because he was violating the rule.\nFor the food, different restaurants prepare their foods in different ways. Some people may like the taste and some don't. It is hard to tell the quarlity since some like extreme spicy and some like extreme the other way."

The beef and sauce are poured over a bed of crispy thin egg noodles.  This is generally a good dish, and this one was not bad at all.  The beef was very tender, and I liked the noodles once they absorb the sauce.\n\nThe combination fried rice was just OK.  It tasted fine, yet something was very plain about it.  I had to add hot sauce so it wouldn't be so boring.  Instead of having slices of meat, some of the meat was shaped in little rectangles, making it seem very cheap.\n\nSooooo considering that you are in a casino in Vegas, not a bad choice for asian food.  For my own preference, I would rather go elsewhere.\n\nPS: Depending on where you are sitting, you can also watch sports on the TVs right outside the restaurant."

This is my favorite noodle place in Vegas and is one that I usually go to at least 2-3 times when I'm out there.  Its open from the 10am till 3am so you can get your favorite chinese food whenever you want.  The line is usually long, however, they do have a carry out.  The people that work there are pretty much the same people for the at least the past three years or so.  The service is excellent and they know what they are doing.  Whenever someone asks for good chinese food, I always recommend Noodle Asia.  The dishes lean more on the real chinese dishes.  Which means you won't find dishes like general tso's chicken or sesame beef on the menu.  However, it should be a must-try if you are serious about food.  Can get slighly oily at times but that should be expected.  Oh, did I say the portions are large?  Slightly more expensive than say chinese off the street but well worth it for a noodle house in a great hotel next to the sportsbook."

I just really liked the food, either that or they got me hooked on MSG or something. Whatever I was, I couldn't take my palette off them for 2 days and I will be searching for food of similar quality back in Philly. I've decided to check Chinatown since I think it's likely there are a few Chinese restaurants there."

We got a bowl of thin egg noodle soup (around $14) with Cantonese dumplings (about 5-6 total) and added crispy roast Duck for another $6.50.  I enjoyed the duck but that made expensive soup way more expensive.  For that price, the duck should've been included.  However it was good and had two thin pieces of Chinese Broccoli.  I ladled it into 3 small bowls so no one was getting full on that.  I also ordered Kim Chee but it was supermarket quality.  Don't bother for nearly $6.  Also got BBQ Pork fried rice.  It was good and the pieces of BBQ pork were nice but I think I would splurge next time and get the 3 meat combo of Roast Duck, BBQ Pork and soya chicken for $23.50.  Many of the tables were ordering the 2-way or 3-way meat combos and they looked delicious.  We ordered a Thai Ice Tea and it was splendid, but for over $40 for just a noodle soup with duck, fried rice, Kim Chee and tea, I would venture off the strip next time and skip this place."

My partner found it during one of his business trips to LV and took me for dinner the very next time we vacationed there. We've been to Sin City six times, and four out of those six, we had most of our lunches and many dinners here at Noodle Asia in the Venetian.\n\nIt's not a very big place at all, and if you didn't know what to look for you'd probably just assume that it's another one of those chain places like Panda Bowl and pass it right by.\n\nAnd if you did that, friend, you were dead wrong. Next time, back it up and go in. It's the gastronomic equivalent of putting a quarter in the Wheel Of Fortune machine and hitting the Grand Prize.\n\nEverything is light, crispy, fresh and always served piping hot. I tend to judge any Chinese place by the quality of their egg and spring rolls, and Noodle Asia's are the kind I wish I could have shipped to my home by the dozen. Not heavy, greasy or stuffy as the more conventional egg rolls, I could just keep ordering these for the entire meal.\n\nAnd then the sesame peanut noodles. My GOD. Is it dessert, or is it dinner? One mouthful, and it doesn't even matter any more. Is it possible for your tongue to have multiple orgasms? I'm pretty sure mine did. \n\nSadly, it's been a couple of years or more since our last LV visit, and I've had dreams about eating at Noodle Asia (oh, yeah, I got it THAT bad.) I've never been a real big seafood fanatic, but I'm pretty sure that those dishes are as awesome as everything else they have, and if I'm lucky, I may get to find out someday.\n\nMeanwhile, if and when you stop by this wonderful place, can you find a way to sneak some spring rolls back to me? I'd be forever in your debt...\n\n;-)"

The food also taste much better than the typical take-out.\n\nI've had multiple noodle dishes from soups to stir-fry and have been impressed with the flavours of each. Standouts include the Szechuan beef stew and the duck soup. The appetizers are where the authenticity of the dishes is apparent as there are offerings unfamiliar to people who frequent the usual Chinese-American places.  My friend ordered a vegetarian rice dish which he enjoyed even though I made fun of his ordering a non-noodle dish at a noodle place."

Had asked her about some of the items on the menu and she answered in a tone that suggested that I should already know!!! I do not work here so it would be very nice of you, as the waitress, to help me understand. Additionally, my lady had asked about getting some steamed rice and this waitress acted liked she had asked for her soul! IS IT REALLY A BIG DEAL TO ASK FOR A 2 SIDES OF RICE!!! REALLY!!! This waitress clearly needed some time off of work or something because she was dropping the ball for her team and this business!!!\n\nSecondly, the eating utensils were not clean at all! Ewww, do you really expect me to use these dirty utensils to eat my food with! I am not a fan of bacteria and to think that it was appropriate to put these out on the table is just foolish! Luckily, I know how to use chopsticks but this is just not okay at all. I felt bad for the all the other customers that did not inspect there silverware! \n\nThe food was alright! I was just more let down but to fact that I had such an awful waitress. \n\nSide note, I had some family friends come out to Vegas while I was there and they also ate at this same restaurant and had the same sentiments. They had bad customer service as well and had issues with their order as well. \n\nI would like to give this place another chance but this disaster that took place while I was here needs to be addressed at some point. \n\n#sadnoodles #paythepriceforsteamedrice"

I have eaten at Noodles Asia a few times due to it being a chinese restaurant and also getting comped food from the pit boss. \n\nFirst time I asked for a comp for 2, pit boss told me that I had $86 to blow at Noodles Asia. I was floored! I never eaten here before and was wondering how 2 people can spend $86 in a chinese restaurant, when we did not plan on ordering Shark's Fin, Abalone, Bird's Nest, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, Sea Cucumber, you know the drill. \n\nBut Yes We Can, at Noodles Asia apparently. The food isn't great, heck, I would go to Ping Pang Pong over at Gold Coast over this place anyday. But I absolutely adore the fact that they have Chicken Mushroom Ginger Soup. Oh this is the reason why I go there. The rest are just for formality. Dim dum mediocre, Fried Rice Oily, Noodles not asian enough. \n\nIn fact, last Saturday, I got drunk playing Baccarat at MGM HL room and got back to the Venetian and decided to have one bowl of soup. Sure it costs $10.95, sure it's still not that good, but it is to me the best item on this menu, and that is good enough reason for me to keep coming back.\n\nFor better dim sum and chinese food in general, head over to Bellagio's Noodles if you want a casino setting, or Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast. Otherwise head over to Chinatown"

It has real authentic flavors and all the chefs in the kitchen are actually Chinese, so you know the food is good and for real here.\n\nEven the hot sauce in the white container on the table is good, and I see many Venetian guests order takeout and probably bring it back to their rooms to eat.  That's how good the food is here.\n\nService is alright so there's really nothing to complain about here.

Among overpriced food in Las Vegas, I am giving this one for 3.5 stars for \n\n- relatively good value comparing to others\n- fast turnover and service during CES when hundreds of thousands of people descend on the city. Even though the wait was 15 people deep, the wait was 10-15 minutes\n\nI had the Sichuan beef noodles and asked them to add baby boo-Choy as an optional item. It was solid. Not the best bowl of noodles by SF standards but very good by Las Vegas standards. Great flavor. Tasty meat and I would highly recommend a vegetable addition to the soup noodle. \n\nSkip the cucumber appetizer. Not very crunchy by the end of the meal."

The chicken wings were excellent and crisply fried but after eating a few bites of the orange chicken I felt like I've been dipped in garlic. This meal exhausted my garlic allotment for the second half of 2015...I love Chinese food but there weren't many option on the menu and it wasn't cheap.  The Thai iced tea was lovely and I would give Noodle Asia another shot."

Food is great.\n\nThe combination soft noodle (chow mein) $16 is excellent. Comes with bbq pork, chicken, duck and others I can't remember. The best chow mein i ever tried. Not too oily or overpowering in flavor. Just perfect. \n\nThe bbq pork and duck with rice is also great. $12. \nThe beef noodle also great. I'm not a soup kind of guy but I do remember that soup. Was good.\n\nThey have little dim sum items also. \n\nThe service is always fast and polite. Sit at the bar. You get to watch the chef in action. \n\nOverall excellent place to get a bite solo or in a group. One of the best chinese restaurant I tried on the strip."

The portion size was definately large enough to share.\n\nThis was not an extremely spicy soup, but it was tasty.

They ended charging us $20 for the dish and the average price of all their rice and noodles dishes is $15 so we thought that was very suspicious. I didn't think to look at the menu prices on Yelp at the time but I just looked and the minced beef rice was $12.50. Menu prices have probably changed a little by then...but not $20. RIDICULOUS!!!!! \n\nMoving along.. We got our check and paid. They never gave us our change. It was so hard to get their attention because they kept avoiding our table and looking away. Finally we flagged someone down and asked for our change. They assumed the change was tip. Ok a restaurant should never assume the change is tip. You can't just keep a customer's change without asking. And we didn't even leave enough for it to be considered tip.... Anyway we were very upset because the service was just really bad. We got our change and left a tip that we felt reflected the service. As we were walking out, the waiter ran to us and told us that they don't need our change and handed us back the tip. I think this speaks for itself....."

I had no complaints--it had a full body flavor that was enhanced by a touch of ginger and the slow cooked, fried pork chop just added to the broth flavor of my meal. The only negative--not spicy at all! It was also disconcerting to be served a noodle dish without any toppings, but I do understand that hoisin sauce, thai basil, bean sprouts, and other condiments could just be a western cultural thing when it comes to noodle soups. My friend ordered the Spicy Ying Nan rice noodle and from what she said, it was spicy!\n\nOverall, the only real negative comment about this restaurant was their rushed service. As soon as we were seated, our waitress came over and asked us what we wanted to order--we had just sat down and didn't even get a chance to look at the menu! Besides that, the water took a long time to be brought to our table as well."

We asked the waitress for just that, and we ended up with a well-executed bok choy and a spicy black bean noodle that wasn't exactly on the menu.

Yes, I am surprised even at myself for giving a 5-star rating to a casual Chinese restaurant.  No, sweet & sour pork and lemon chicken are not in my repertoire of Chinese food.  No, I was not drunk when I visited the restaurant; and I think reviews by those who admitted being drunk and their judgement impaired should be tossed out.   I am picky so I do not like just anything.  I grew up in Hong Kong, have travelled to major Chinese cities, and have lived in both Vancouver and San Francisco for many years so I know my Chinese foods.\n\nI do have to emphasize though that my rating is based on one dish that I had.\n\nMy parents and I were spending a few days in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  After coming out from \"O\", my parents retired to their room for the evening.  I was getting hungry even though we had a big lunch so I wandered around to check out the restaurants opening late in Palazzo / Venetian where we stayed.  I had been to Noodles in Bellagio and Zine in Palazzo.  Both were decent so I thought I would give Noodle Asia a try.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive.  The prices are very reasonable considering that it is a hotel restaurant.  I ordered a plate of fried rice with Chinese sausages, egg white and Chinese broccoli.  It didn't take long until a generous serving arrived.   It looked just as simple as the menu suggested with 3 ingredients and rice.  I took a bite and I said to myself, \"OMG.  This is the best fried rice I've ever had.\"  And it was, seriously, the best fried rice I've ever had anywhere!  The Chinese sausage slices were sweet and tender.  The egg whites were fluffy.  However, the rice was the star of the dish.  It was not browned with dark soy sauce and it has all the flavours from being fried in a hot and well-seasoned wok.  \n\nThe plate was just under $14.  Although the restaurant is a essentially a cafe but it was far better than any $15 - $18 fried rice dishes served in many other well appointed restaurants.\n\nA few weeks later and I still remember the dish.  My partner is going to Vegas for a conference in a couple of weeks and I told him he needed to go there and order the rice if he could only eat out once."

Located in the Venetian casino, my dad and I passed by and decided on a whim to give it a try. We tried the stir-fried noodles with chicken, and the BBQ pork and duck rice dish (this seemed to be one of their most popular dishes - several of the tables around us also ordered this dish). \n\nThe great thing about Noodle Asia is the good selection of dishes, they bring your food out quickly, and the food just reminded me of a good home-cooked meal. I'm not claiming that the food is super authentic Chinese food, but it's definitely a few steps above Panda Express or any other fast-food Chinese establishment. The food was hot and fresh, it tasted good, and you were given a lot of food. What else could you ask for?\n\nThe dishes ranged from rice dishes, a couple of dim sum options, moo shu, rice porridge, to noodle soups, wok-tossed noodles, and soups. With two, you should order at least two dishes, with each dish around $12-16. I wouldn't say the atmosphere is the best, because you're basically sitting in an open-area restaurant in the middle of the casino, but it suits the fast-casual experience. \n\nWe came relatively early for dinner, around 6 pm, but as we left, a line was starting to form to get seated. Definitely plan on coming early, because I don't know if the food is necessarily worth a long wait."

I used to think that these joints were only offered by hotels as a way to satisfy their Asian clientele from overseas.  I mean, all those old Asian guys gotta find something to remind them of home while they take a break from Pai Gow right?\n\nPrices are a bit steep relative to normal Asian places, but obviously there's going to be a premium for being where you're at.  They're probably betting that you're not going to go out somewhere off the strip in search of cheaper Chinese food in that desert heat.  And being a casino, they're taking the smart bet.  At least they don't cheat you on your order; portions are still pretty respectable.\n\nFor an appetizer, we grabbed the Spicy Tofu dish off the little menu card in those plastic holders on the table. I was expecting to get cubes, but it turned out to be thin slices off a tofu block that had been stir fried and then triangled. There were approximately 10 slices or so, and the whole thing was spiced up wtih chili oil sauce.  Taste was pretty good and there was certainly a bit of kick, but there had to be just based on the amount of that oil on the plate.  Seriously, I imagine a little part of health freaks would die if they saw this dish (i wonder if I should even bother calling it a \"sauce\").  \n\nThe Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Lo Mein?...not sure of the spelling) was touted by one of my friends as possibly the best he's ever had outside of Taiwan (and apparently, one of the the spiciest based on the beads of sweat rolling down his head).  Three of the four of us ended up getting it based on how much he kept talking about the dish (my other friend ordered the Cantonese Beef Stew instead).  The broth was flavorful and it didn't seem too bad with the sodium level.  Certainly no worse than the average bowl of pho.  There were some good size chunks of meat to go with the noodles, so it certainly will help get you full.\n\nNot too bad of a find for a hotel eatery, especially if you want to lay off some of that rich food in the buffet.  Three stars if only because I can't afford to give one more after all these inflated prices.  That said, it's still probably one of the more cost effective meals you can find, so you could do worse in that regard.  And btw, that broth really isn't all that spicy, so I don't think you have to worry about sweating like my friend."

Umm...if a place is Noodle Asia, one should probably stick to the noodles??? Yup, indeed. The Singaporean noodle dish was fantastic, albeit a little on the greasy side. They didn't skimp on shrimp or pork and the portion was huge for only a nickel shy of 13 bucks. Definitely on the re-order list again.\n\nAs for the Roasted duck/BBQ pork entree (which cost $2 more), it was passable, but less than satisfactory for me since I've been eating this stuff since I was a child. The duck wasn't of the highest quality and the pork was too soft and a bit too much on the sweet side. Again, they do give you an enormous portion. \n\nThe takeout system was a little weird. I placed my order with the hostess, sat on a slot machine right in front of her and she never once called me number or told me that my order was ready. After 25 minutes of clicking buttons on my phone, I realized that it had probably already been half an hour at that point and went to ask her if it was ready. She walks back and grabs it from underneath the line. It was still warm, but I was literally in her line of sight the whole time and never got one notice for it.

The food was piping hot and you can tell it just came off the grill.\n\nBut the quality? Definitely not authentic-tasting and lacked flavor. You can always add soy sauce to make it more satisfying.

(More typically, this would be yakisoba, or fried soba noodles). And they do have at least 1 Korean dish, Kimchee! I didn't see any Viet noodles, Thai noodles, Korean noodles, Singaporean noodles, or more Japanese noodles, etc. \n\nThe atmosphere is casual, with an open view of the large woks in the kitchen, with the water flowing over the cooking area to remove all the grease and tidbits spilled in the stir-fry cooking process, just like a Chinatown kitchen. \n\nThe food isn't bad actually. The green veggie of the day was a choice of Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) or Baby Bok Choy. I went for the Bok Choy. NIce small baby stems. \n\nI also ordered a bowl of Nau Nam Mein Curry Soup, or Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle Soup, It hit the spot and warmed me up, as I was chilled by the overactive air-conditioning in the Venetian. I don't know how those cocktail waitresses in the skimpy, short , sleeveless, bar wench dresses can stand the chill. Their dual weather barometers definitely would perk up in the nippyness.  Mine did!\n\nI also ordered an oolong tea, which came in a cast iron Japanese style tea pot. \n\nThe service is just a little friendlier than a Chinatown diner. But they are strict about waiting to be seated! IF you seat yourself, they may call you out on it! There is a bar you can eat at and watch the cooks, or plenty of tables where you can watch the gamblers and those freezing waitresses. \n\nSo Oolong tea, baby bok choy, and Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle soup. Sounds like about $10 in your typical Chinatown, right?\n\nThis is Vegas baby, try and guess again. Go higher, way higher! \n\nHow about $30!?\nFor one person?!? WTF! \n\nIf you are a cheap Chinese person raised in Chinatown or FOB, or if you are less than fourth generation ABC, don't go here! You will feel ripped off!  This is not Hon's Won Ton on Kearney in SF for sure! \n\nTea: $3.50\nStir Fried Bok Choy: $12.00\nCurry Beef Noodle Soup: $12.95\nTax: $2.30\nTotal $30.75!\n\nYou are better off driving down Spring Mountain just outside of the Venetian, due west to about Valley View, and go to Las Vegas' Chinatown. (Actually, unlike Noodle Asia, you can get Viet, Korean, Thai, and most of the other noodles of Asia from there.)"

We shared the following dishes: \n\n-Won ton soup \n-Har gow (Steamed, crescent-shaped mini shrimp dumplings) \n-Red won tons (Tossed in Szechwan Hung Yao chili, garlic sauce) \n-Buddha's feast pan-toasted noodles \n\nThe food was very authentic and made for Chinese folks. It's not a 5 star Chinese joint but it's not  that Panda Express junk made for the every day gringo. It's your typical late night Chinese cafe. Get in, get out. \n\nThis place hits the spot when you've had one too many cocktails. They are open until 3 am and the best part is, there are Chinese men cooking your food! What more could you ask for?"

Bingo.\n\nPlus they had kimchi. Best combo when ill. \n\nTheir kimchi wasn't fermented/spoiled like I prefer but it still has the pungent strength to destroy symptoms. Trust. It's good meds w/jjuk (or congee since we're here).\n\nToo, their teapot is generously filled with teabags (plural - yes) so all was in his favor :) MMM hot brewed oolong teabags. I'm a fan.\n\nNothing wrong with this casual eatery sit-down location next to the Race & Sports Booking area of the Venetian. Being next to it actually kept us visually entertained."
