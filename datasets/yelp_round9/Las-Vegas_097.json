            "review": "I have been too the other restaurant in downtown but first time at this location. I was in the area. So figure try the original location plus hungry nothing better for lunch then plate lunch. I should have tried something new but enjoyed the chicken and eggplant last time so got it again. Most part it same menu as the other location although in this one Poke Express in the store too and have lot more desserts lot of them individual pieces packed too go containers take home. The selection is pretty huge but like Poke (I love! So need make stop again just too try it) and dessert only had room for lunch. \n\nIt interesting way store set up with one half being sit down restaurant style and other side local style find place sit down eat. Thankfully went late lunch because less then twenty seats. Side you seat yourself. \n\nSure if ever in need for some good local food and sushi. It offers the best of both worlds."

            "review": "I've been coming to this place for awhile now and I think it deserves a review . When you walk in there are three different 'stations' I would say . You got poke express which is a company set aside on its own . Then two more sections that is just island sushi . One side is mainly the fast hawaiian food and one that is more sit down with the AYCE sushi option. \n\nThey've got a happy hour I like to go to every Monday - Wednesday all day that is half off select rolls. I love the surf & turf! I can't not come here without eating it . The food is really yummy , however the real let down is how they lack in service . It is just so-so and sometimes irritating. Whenever I come to the sit down section I can always expect service to be slow and mediocre. Usually it takes a long time for them to refill drinks and take your order, esp if your an AYCE . There not rude or anything there just extremely slow , which is why it didn't get 5 stars. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice , it clean with two tvs on either side. It also has a sort of mini billboard on at each of the side tables that advertises local businesses . \n\nI LOVE the Togo/fast food side of this place. It's so yummy , everything that I've gotten from there . I especially love the bentos , can never go wrong with those. If your looking to buy poke I suggest going to the poke express counter . \n\nTada!"

            "review": "Ate there're twice this past week thinking the 1st visit was just a bad day for them since they could not get  2 bento plate served correctly without missing items.\n\n Yet the 2nd visit for lunch took them 1hr and 15 mins to get a 1 plate lunch and 1 mini plate lunch order correct, which they never need get right. In frustration, we just left with what they gave us. \n\nNot worth even 1 star\n\nUpdate..... 2/01/2016  called in  2 garlic chicken Mini to go, told 10-15mins. Arrived 16mins paid then waited additional 40 mins. Asked for refund, then told the plates where sitting here next to the dount machine for 30 mins. Never did hear from Terrance, yet noticed the abundance of sign which read\" Check your meal before you leave we are not responsible\". Apparently, that's the owners efforts to correct the lack of attention his staff has a handling his customers orders. BTW, It took the manager 22mins to refund my credit card. Of course, they offer the food for free and a box of donuts. I declined since the food sat on the counter forever. I told the cashier and manager, I prefer to pay for my food that way the restaurants stay in business. Several of the patrons waiting for there food nodded in agreement to my conversation with the manager.   I asked to have Terrance the owner call me, which he never did. I can't believe this is not an on going problem with Island Sushi, they wasted another 1hour plus of my day"

The sushi is presented with a hawaiin/polynesian accent and is very delicious.  The service is very friendly (the Ohana spirit is alive and well here).  Please try the crunch roll and oh yeah for dessert try the 808 ice cream."

I was in town with family for a tradeshow and NONE of us were disappointed. In fact, we all agreed we'd Yelp about how amazing this place was. The server was awesome. My cousin asked if they had a roll with strawberries and they didnt, but about 10 minutes later the owner and sushi chef cam and asked what she was looking for. He custom made a roll for her.  We were all doing the all you can eat (I highly recc it), so to go out of his way to make a special roll even though we weren't paying more for us--was way too generous and was the icing on the cake.  If you are in town, live in town and want AMAZING, fresh quality sushi, check this place out."

Not only do they have super sushi rolls, but the service is exceptional and friendly.\n\nChuy was our sushi chef and he really made sure to take care of my wife as she is with child and she can't have any fish that is not already cooked.\n\nChuy made what we call a Chuy Special it had Cream Cheese, Cooked Tempura Shrimp, Sesame, eel sauce and a bunch of other stuff that was so yummy & very tasty!!\n\nAlso our sever really went out of her way to hook us up with appetizers and gave us several recommendations of things to try and our water cups were full without asking the whole time.\n\nWhat an exceptional value and service........next time you go don't forget to ask Chuy for the Chuy Special what a treat you will not be disappointed! Don't forget to pick-up some Hawaiian Custard Doughnuts on the way out...WOW!!"

            "review": "This is by far MY FAVORITE AYCE sushi place!  It's not that close to the Las Vegas Strip, but driving here is totally worth it.  Upon entering, the first section you're in is their bake shop where you can order malasadas and wonderful treats like cocoa puffs.  To the right is the main dining area.  You can choose to order a la carte style or AYCE.  From their regular menu, we ordered their garlic chicken, mochiko chicken, and fried noodles.  ALL TASTED GREAAAAT!  From their sushi menu, we ordered ahi poke (tuna), tako poke (octopus), ebi (shrimp), ika (squid), masago (smelt roe), unagi (fresh water eel), amaebi (sweet shrimp), and their uni (sea urchin).  We also ordered a few specialty rolls.  All were very good and fresh!  Just writing this review makes me want to drive 4 hours just to eat here!  Okay, back to their review.  Their friendly staff did a great job in making sure we had enough food and when we would place an order, the food came out fresh and quick.  This AYCE isn't your typical buffet where you get up and serve yourself.  Your server comes around and you would inform them what menu item you'd like to order.  Simple as that!  When the place gets extremely busy, they have a 90 min. time limit.  The rules are noted on each table.  However when we were there, it was pretty packed and we stayed their longer than 90 minutes.  I guess they don't want you to practically live there and live off of their awesome food.  Also, they don't like it when you waste their awesome sushi.  So order accordingly.  It's an AYCE, so pace yourself.  DO NOT ORDER RICE OR ELSE YOU WILL GET FULL FAST!  For each person, it's about $24.  Don't come here expecting to eat crab legs all day.  For $24, that is a VERY good deal for fresh and great tasting sushi.  Their AYCE menu is extensive.  Did I mention that their mochiko and garlic chicken are both delicious?  I will most definitely eat here again."

I absolutely love the MINI garlic chicken, that comes with a scoop of rice and side salad of miso ginger dressing, just enough food for lunch or small dinner. their rice is sticky and the bottom of the rice scoop gets soaked in the garlic chicken sauce, best part of the entire dish. poke express is also in island sushi, and they have the best fresh assorted poke! for dessert, get a plain malasada!"

We made sure to make reservations as this place is such a hidden gem and books up quickly.  The restaurant is a little small  We are from LA and Island Sushi and Grill is one of the BEST hawaiian/sushi places we've been to hands down.  Add in an AYCE option and you can't lose!!\n\nThe staff is so helpful and accommodating giving off the classic island hospitality.  We can only imagine how chaotic it was for the staff to cater our party, with all the al la carte and all you can eat options, but they did it with ease.  The food was delicious and well prepared and came out in a timely matter.  Our whole team was so impressed with the selection and quality of the food.  We've been here several times and are always impressed and pleased with the food, drinks, and service."

The only seats available were at the bar which I don't prefer but we were starving and most people there looked like they had just sat down. The guy making the rolls didn't check up on us to see if we wanted to order more. The servers only came up to us once to refill our drinks. We always had to wave them down for refills. We ordered hot tea which we never got and they still tried to charge us for it. It took about 25 minutes just to get our dessert. I'm really upset to have had the service we received today because I usually enjoy coming here. I don't know if it's because we sat at the bar but that really shouldn't change their service. Really good food but had horrible service today."

            "review": "3.5 Stars. Great food that comes with oblivious service. I really want to give it four stars, but missing and unfinished rolls can't justify it. Las Vegas is dubbed an honorary island due to \"Local Kine\" diaspora/migration to the desert, and as a result, we get lots of Hawaiian eateries in the valley. Yay! I personally do not like macaroni salad, deep-fried rolls, any roll that contains cream cheese, and sweet sauces. All these preferences go against many Americanized sushi and Hawaiian food protocol. Take my review with a grain of salt. \n\nTheir poke is delicious (at $10/lbs for takeout). Me and spicy food are like kindred spirits. I recommend the Lava Lover and Spicy Mexican. The standard Rainbow roll is tasty as well. The all-you-can-eat is a good deal, as long as you can grub until you burst. I love how the rolls aren't stuffed with rice like other places, but I don't like how many of the rolls are doused with this sweet sauce (miso? eel? ponzu? not sure) which was not pleasant and weird. Now only if they didn't forget my rolls, I would highly recommend it."

The prices are standard for AYCE ($21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner) and well worth it. You have many choices of appetizers/sides and my favorites are the ahi poke (from Poke Express), mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, sashimi salad, and kimchee fried rice. Good stuff. I like to order the hand rolls with hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon). Fresh and delicious. My favorite specialty rolls are the Black Widow, Dragon, Island Special, Tiger, Kahuku, and Pauhana.\n\nWe celebrated my dad's birthday there last May and it was also Mother's Day so we participated in the AYCE Sushi plus Sunday brunch. The special menu featured breakfast favorites like pancakes and mimosas. There were also additional desserts that were unlimited like cream puffs and filled malasadas (they were both so, so good). I thought it was just for the holiday, but I saw a similar menu during another visit, so it may be a Sunday Brunch thing. Either way, I recommend a visit with the special menu because it made the meal so much better."

            "review": "After almost a year of not having their Spicy Tuna bowl, due to some food reaction, I gave them another try. I called in for pick-up. They said to give them 15 minutes.  I appreciate that I can call in and pick-up my food. \n\nI get there in a little over 15 minutes. There's about 5 people ahead of me and only 1 person taking orders, serving food, answering the phone, etc. I finally get to the front and the lady grabs my food directly from the counter. I pay and leave, drive about 10 minutes to work. I eat the bowl, everything seems okay. About 15 minutes after I was done, my face was flushed red as well as my upper body. I felt itchy and noticed I was having the same exact reaction as the first time. \n\nI called to ask if maybe some ingredient was the cause of my reaction and my only conclusion is poor handling of the raw fish. I'm only writing this because I don't want others to get sick or turn away because of something simple that can be fixed. \n\nThe person I spoke to on the phone ensured me that the fish is fresh and is made to order. While, I don't identify that as the issue, I did suggest that if a pick-up order is raw fish, it should be refrigerated up until the person comes in and picks up their order; much like they do with the macaroni salad. She insisted that it's refrigerated until the person picks it up,  but that definitely wasn't the case since the person at the front just picked up my pick-up order on the counter (next to the musubi warmer) and rang up my order. There was no packing of the food. \n\nPlease take the food packing safe items like Spicy Tuna. I've had the spicy tuna bowl for dine in and never had issues so I really think it's due to letting it sit out while a person is on their way, waits in line, etc. \n\nOtherwise, my advice for yelpers is to never order their Spicy Tuna bowl for pick-up. I'm 0 for 2. Fortunately, the symptoms are not serious and generally go away after 2 or so hours. Hope this helps!"

I was surprised to see how busy it was, being it was a Monday. Then again, they did have Monday night football on. \n- Our orders came quickly. First with the appetizers. The sashimi salad is definitely a must try. Lots of flavor and sashimi pieces. \n- There are certain items that you can only get once, so we got the soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was actually pretty big compared to other AYCEs around the area. Although, in the Sacramento area, there is no limit to soft shell crab. Nonetheless, it was great! \n- The salmon skin roll is always on the top of my list when it comes to getting sushi. More salmon skin than actual pieces of salmon which was good, and not too oily. \n- The dynamite wasn't the best I've had. Inaka tasted a bit better. \n- The nigiri pieces were solid. Hamachi, salmon, sweet shrimp always rank. \n- Out of the special rolls we got, I do regret getting the lava lover roll bc it a too mushy. The salmon lover was a hit. And the surf and turf was alright. Turf tasted like L&L bbq. \n- Hamachi kama tasted like others. No bone. good. \n- Service was quick and friendly. Bathrooms were clean. \n- Best AYCE sushi buffet in the area. The change changer was their desserts! Tempura ice cream FTW. Fried banana! YUM!"

(Unless they rub me in a really good way and I've thoroughly enjoyed it.) \n\nFirst off, this place is the pits. I've been coming here for a while now, and I've experienced quality degrade. The more I come, the less I want to be here. Today is the final nail in the coffin. \n\nWhat a long wait time to even order food! I was in line for a good 7 minutes before I was given attention to place an order. \n\nPrices are outrageous! For what I got, I would have preferred any other Hawaiian restaurant that's more filling and has better quality.\n\nI got the garlic chicken and chicken katsu combo. My mom got a saimin. So what's easier? Two pieces of different styles of chicken and frying it, or putting noodles, some toppings in a bowl with broth? You tell me...\n\nI got mine in 7 minutes after ordering and was told the saimin will be right out. Great! Then, we waited 7/8 more minutes before requesting a refund. I don't like eating in front of other people, and I don't like waiting so long for something so easy. From the time we ordered to the time I requested a refund... 30 minutes. There was a little wait to ask for a refund. \n\nMaybe I was a little impatient, but don't bring out other people's order when a part of a party has already received their food and the rest haven't. Don't forget to season your customers' food. \n\nWe ended up going to Aloha Kitchen on Sunset road and it was only 7 minutes from the time we ordered for it to be bagged ready to go. And they were equally as busy as this failure.\n\nThe saving grace which allows for two really generous stars are for their malasadas and their poke. Besides that, you have plenty of Hawaiian favorites to choose from, don't go here if you want to wait and want to eat tasteless food."

The rolls came out quick and were pretty creative.\nBest part, my son was 1/2 price because he was under 10 but he ate 20 pieces of salmon sushi :p"

Wiped out a rainbow roll, chicken katsu and the 808 Special (a humongous dessert with deep fried bananas, 2 scoops of ice cream, fruits and whipped cream).\n\nDid I mention that their malasadas are the best that I've had on the mainland?  Cause they are!!  Okay, I've only been here one, but for that one visit....oh man!  They were so good!  I hope that the next time we go here, there malasadas are still scrumptiously divinely yummy!!\n\nIt is located off of the Strip so if you're visiting Vegas, then you'll have to drive or take a taxi.  It is worth it though!  If you are from Vegas, then check them out for yourself."

There are 2 Tv's which usually has sports on (for you sports lovers) and a small bar where you can watch the chefs make sushi. If you are on a sushi fix, I recommend purchasing the \"all you can eat\" sushi menu. It is worth the price you pay! Noise level can get loud when there's a big sports event on TV."

Perfectly sugared, fried to perfection on the outside with a slight crispyness and then you hit that warm and luscious dough on the inside which gives a light but chewy goodness. Next time I'm ordering a dozen for myself. Coco puffs were quite tasty too. Chocolate pudding was good, the puff was nice and light, and the macadamia nut frosting on top was the closest I've had to Liliha bakery's mac nut butter."

Ive eaten at the sushi side a couple of times and just as it was before the service was eeeh ok at best, i expected better and faster service since its not always full capacity when we go.\n\nI really enjoyed the extra pupus that you can order, my favorite was the \"seared garlic-peppered ahi belly\" that was the best thing on there, but the only bad thing was that it was limit one order per person, so i recommend getting that as one of the last of your sushi orders, my favorite dessert from the pupu menu was their small slush or ice cream float shot, the one on the menu this time as the green apple slush float shot, it was very very good i got a brain freeze after downing a couple lol. The rest of the menu was just ok nothing really special.\n\nFor the grill side i always used to drive 8 miles just to get their bento or malasadas, pretty far drive just for some food but its worth it when i have the Hawaii food craving, i don't go there much anymore since i always hit up the IslandbreezeLV truck which is almost always closer to me than Island Sushi."

I told her to drive further north towards my favorite intersection in LV (215/Eastern) because I've always wanted to try Sunday brunch at Island Sushi.\n\nWe both had all you can eat, we had dinner pricing because we wanted some of the dinner only items as well.  They have a special Sunday Brunch pupus menu and I pretty much ordered all of it.  The one item per person on the pupus menu, crab poke something, had a nice spice kick to it and it's basically a small crab cut in half with that spicy sauce. \n\nI'm the unlimited mimosas champagne, I mean champion, and I had that here as well.  Keep it coming man, keep pouring it.  Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and so service was spotty.  Luckily we sat on the table at the far south east end so servers always passed us but even so, it was somewhat hard to get their attention.  But back to my mimosa, I started with the guava mimosa and it just didn't work.  I ended my next 6 refills with regular champagne.  The thick guava syrup was just too sweet and settled on the bottom of the glass.\n\nSo do come and try Island Sushi but Sunday brunch (gotta have a taste for their pupus section) is a definite must try.  I'll definitely be back."

It's also very easily accessible, right off the 215 on eastern, you'll head south on eastern and its about a quarter mile to the left behind Taco y Taco, and Smashburger.\n\nDa Local 4/5: its a little bit confusing when you go inside, there is a sushi bar to the right, then the entrees as soon as you come in to the left, and finally the poke all the way in the back.\n\nCustomer Service 2/5: Even though I'm a Hapa Haole I didn't feel any of the love when walking in, the employees inside didn't greet us. While my wife and I were standing in front of the cashier trying to figure out where the poke bowls where at, non of the employees behind the counter tried to help us out. There were two guys standing behind the counter yet not a single one greeted us or offered his assistance.\n\nNow when we figured out the poke stand was in the back, the lady there was very helpful and did an excellent job, because of her they get a 2/5.\n\nDa Poke 5/5: Da poke was on point I got the spicy poke and it tasted da bomb, flavor so good it broke da mouth!!! My wife got the spicy tuna avocado, hers was just as good! the Flavor brought me right back to the islands. Something to mention about their poke which is very important is that their poke comes from POKE EXPRESS, located in North Vegas, Uncle makes the best Poke in the valley and its great that his poke make it all the way over here. \n\nPS: the presentation of the poke stand took me back to Tamuras.\n\nDa Rice 3/5: it was alright nothing too yummy nothing too bad just alright, I wish they made sushi rice but hey now we know.\n\nDa Price 5/5: In Oahu, if you go to tamuras a pound of spicy tuna poke is $15:99, here at this mainland establishment it's the same price! This made me so happy because the prices where the SAME!!! I was expecting this type of poke in the valley to be more expensive.\n\nOverall go to this place if you live in the south part of the valley. My advice is to bring your own rice, Teri sauce, and crunch, then buy half a pound of poke and poke salad...now you have created your own poke bowl which will be the bomb as long as you know how to make bomb ass rice. \n\nIf your looking for a really nice establishment but are not brown don't expect nice service here, you know what don't even expect them employees to even look at you. There is no Aloha here and that breaks my heart. Next time I go will be just to get the poke and then get go eat at home."

We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken immediately by a very friendly gentleman.  We gave our order to the waitress.  We didn't want AYCE, so maybe we weren't worth her time.  Half our order came within 5 minutes.  The other half came 45 mins later.  A couple was seated 15 minutes AFTER us, got their food, ate, paid their bill and left before we received the rest of our order.  It was mochiko chicken, and other than being a little overcooked, it was delicious.  We then waited another 20 min after completely finishing our meal for our waitress to come back and get our order for dessert (which was included in the price of the meal I ordered) There were only 4 other tables occupied at this point....and at least 2 other wait staff.  This was a very insulting experience.  I can understand mistakes when a waitress is very busy, but being obviously ignored when she only had one other table was just too much.  I skipped dessert and just got the check.  To his credit, the man who took our drink orders ran to get us malasadas to go, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  Our waitress was nowhere to be seen and didn't apologize for the poor service once.  We spent nearly 2 hours there, and she spoke to us a total of 4 times.\n\nI'll stick to the grill and Poke Express after this.  Unless we decide on AYCE, since that seems to be the only way to get service in the restaurant."

When you walk in, you enter the grill side (order at counter). To the right, is the sushi side. Both sides have a sort of dive feel. And not that \"isn't this so neat\" dive feel. More of the \"where's the posted letter grade\" dive feel.\n\nThe servers were definitely friendly and the service was perfectly fine. \n\nThe menu is fairly lengthy with a good variety of different types of rolls. I tried 4 different sushi rolls and the edamame. All were just \"eh\". Everything was too squishy and nothing tasted particularly fresh. And I wasn't impressed by any of the flavor combinations (despite them sounding good).\n\nMaybe I just ordered the wrong items? Neither the food nor the atmosphere made the mark for me. There are definitely far better strip mall sushi joints out there."

You order at the counter first and they will bring your meal to the table.  We went during dinner time and there was 10 people already in line.  There's a sushi only section on the other side of this restaurant.  Crowds of people always stand in line to eat here.  We will have to go back and try their sushi next time.  \n\nThe oxtail soup has a different tasting broth.  It's more like an udon tasting broth which we found to be very interesting.  The oxtail meat was very fatty which also made the broth quite oily.  My meat had A lot of fat attached versus what I would get at the California hotel.  Quality was lacking but it was good enough for us to eat for dinner at a reasonable time.  \n\nThe chicken Kutsu was prepared just right and I am enjoyed eating this more than the ox tail soup.  The poke was good for what you'd get in Vegas where it is nowhere close to an ocean!  My mother-in-law got the garlic chicken and that was very flavorful!  Overall I would come here again when I'm visiting Vegas.  Good comfort food but avoid prime dinner hours!"

For example, the garlic ahi was one of my favorites but now it's terrible. It's a few thin slices of ahi smothered in an awful, oily, overlooked mixture of shredded cabbage and onions. I scraped it all off and threw it away. \n\nI was also very disappointed in the hamburger steak I ordered previously but I thought it was hard to screw up fried ahi. Boy was I wrong. \n\nWhomever is cooking the dishes must not be tasting their cooking because the quality and flavors aren't close to what you can get at almost any eatery in Hawaii.\n\nResponse to owner: I can't remember the day I was there but it was about a week before my posting. To reiterate, fried ahi has enough taste on its own. Best to season it properly and if anything, place it on a thin bed of fresh shredded cabbage.  The ahi I got was smothered in an oily mess of overdone cabbage and onions. There was more cabbage and onions than ahi. Further, the Mac salad needs more flavor. Just mixing it in mayo doesn't cut it. Sorry for the negative rating but I was very disappointed with my meal and I remember it being better in the past. I even mentioned to my wife that you must have new fry cooks."

With the new car rental terminal thingy being miles away from the airport, I got lost and wound up going the wrong direction in search of the Strip. Don't laugh at me. I'm horrible with my bearings once I get anywhere, but once I get my internal GPS going, I'm good to go.\n\nAt any rate, we wound up consulting our Garmin to look for a sushi place and were actually looking for Koto Sushi (never been, but hell it came up on our search so why the hell not), but found that was Island Sushi instead. Scared as hell that sushi can be either BOMB or ASS, we entered in and knew that it wasn't all bad when everyone, well, almost everyone except us, were island folk! No shit! I was thrilled because you want to go to a restaurant that has the people there. Go to a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have chinese people? Are you high? Anyways, real Hawaiians, real ono food, you heard?\n\nHusbandido ordered the chirashi and was NOT disappointed. Was thrilled when he couldn't finish it (take that SF chirashi!) and saw just how much rice there was to offer. I ordered chicken katsu dinner and lo and behold it came with dessert (808 special is a must have, people). So I give them mad props. I frequent SF sushi just as regularly as I frequent my home, and it's nice to find good, solid sushi and grinds as I would at home. I would dare to say not necessarily just good...but maybe better!\n\nI highly recommend this, even if you're not lost. It's worth a drive out, and it's not too far off the freeway to scare the crap out of you.  You will definitely have enough scratch to hit the casinos afterward. Two hungry people fresh from the plane? $34. Baller status.\n\nOh and the peeps that work there are really COOL! Love 'em. Mahalo!"

My boyfriend is obsessed with AYCES so we've been to A LOT of places in Vegas. I would like to think I knew what I was talking about. The menu was so small, I couldn't believe it. Especially since so many reviews are saying what a big selection they have. I don't like the fact that they don't have pictures of the rolls on their menu. I would like to see what I'm ordering. I personally don't eat raw fish so I like to order rolls that are baked or fried. Not one single item was like that. The menu does say baked and fried but they just cook the stuff on top so the rice is still cold. My boyfriend loves albacore tuna. We went at lunch time and they didn't have it so we had to pay dinner prices to get what we came for. He didn't like it at all. He said that the fish was room temperature. I thought that the shrimp and the unagi were fishy. The rolls were nothing special at all. I did like the fact that they were relatively bite size. Some places we go to they cut their rolls so big I have to struggle to get the darn thing in my mouth. My biggest complaint, only one desert per person. The whole reason I go to anything all you can eat is so I can get lots of desert. Luckily my boyfriend doesn't eat sweets too much so I got his. I absolutely love mochi but I didn't get any because the only flavors to choose from were strawberry and mango. I'm a vanilla and chocolate kind of girl.

My hubby and I had a number of sushi rolls which were all very good and fresh too.  \n\nWhat sticks out in my mind the most about this place however, were not the sushi rolls we ate, but the malasadas we ordered after dinner.  OMFG!  They were soooo insanely delicious!!!  My hubby ordered the plain malasada and I ordered the custard filled malasada.  So freaking good!  It was worth going to a shady area just to eat.  Best foodie find in a while.  They were fresh, soft and warm.  The custard was perfect, not too sweet or overpowering and very creamy.  It was so good, it made it worth while cheating on my diet!  The plain malasada was very tasty too, but the custard filled one was over the top.  A little piece of heaven in your mouth I tell you!  They also have chocolate and haupia filled malasadas too!\n\nI would definitely dine here again as they have a pretty large Hawaiian food menu too.  They have very good prices for breakfast and lunch that I will for sure have to try the next time I am in Vegas.\n\n\nVERDICT:  GO FOR THE CUSTARD FILLED MALASADAS!  Your taste buds will thank me! :)"

Keep doing what you are doing. The lunch all you can eat was a phenomenal deal that left us all more then full with delicious food. To the people who live in the area consider yourselves lucky, Island sushi is the real deal."

            "review": "This review is strictly for the Grill part of Island Sushi & Grill.  There's a huge difference between the two.  \n\nYou walk into this restaurant and unless you know the drill, it can be a bit confusing.  The menu is plastered on the flat screen with a good variety of Hawaiian eats.  Then you look to the right and there's a curtain leading into the Sushi side of the restaurant, where you need to sign your name and wait for a greeter to come out.  We have yet to try the sushi, so I can't comment. \n\nBack to the Grill.  You can always mix the plates for two meats, add brown rice for a fee.\n\nChicken katsu curry- breaded with panko, fried to a beautiful brown, then a scoopful of curry spread over the chicken.  The chicken evenly sliced and you could see a good cut of meat with just enough panko crust for a good crisp texture. \n\nLau Lau- Last I heard, they do fly it in from Hawaii, so you can't mess this one up since it's from a trusted brand.  Good chunk of meat, good small bit of butterfish and love the taro leaves.\n\nKalua Pork- This is one of my favorite.  It has a nice smokey flavor, good shredded pork and a small amount of cabbage (some times more cabbage, which I like).  A simple, yet flavorful and satisfying dish.\n\nCome for saimin, oxtail soup, local moco, musubi or Korean bbq.  So far, this is my favorite place for authentic Hawaiian flavors.  \n\nThey have malasadas (not a fan), haupia desserts, chocolate this, banana that, a whole display case that can be quite luring.  \n\nPay $2 for the frequent customer loyalty card.  After you spend $250, they credit $25 for food here. (This card is not good for the poke counter, just for the kitchen food and sushi from the restaurant)."

Never ordered ahi poke to go like that.  We ordered a quarter lb of the poke furikake, hawaiian, and the spicy poke. Decent priced.\n \nWe also ordered to go... the teriyaki beef with noodle combo & the garlic chicken combo. I kinda felt like i should have asked, \"can i have some beef with my noodles?\" Don't get me wrong, the noodles were good, but I felt like there was just not enough beef.... or chicken.\n\nThe staff at the Poke Express area was very very nice. But the rest of the staff behind the grill and register are kinda rude and snoody. And from reading other reviews, it seems like these people have good days and bad days. Word of advice for those moody people.... please leave your bad attitude at home. Its a good thing that the food and the Poke Express person was nice, or i would give this place two stars."

The food came out relatively quickly but we had no way of remembering who ordered what (as is common with big sushi orders).  My end of the table continually received tons of sushi to the point where we asked if it was a mistake.  The server kept saying that this was what we ordered even after suggesting several times that perhaps it was for the other end of our large party who hadn't received most of the sushi they had ordered.  Since there is a time limit and a per piece charge for uneaten sushi we cancelled the remaining order for our end of the table.  \nMeanwhile, the other end of the table had only received one of the rolls out of the 5-6 they had ordered.  When it was brought to the servers attention, she said that it was coming.....but still didn't put it together that our end of the table had gotten way more than we ordered.  \nSo, long story short, the owner came out and pretty much said \"too bad\" and that they could order more since it was all you can eat...  We were already past the 90 minute limit and most of the party was done eating.  Reality is that they were just unaccommodating.  The sushi was fine and the price was right...but I felt bad that some of our party left hungry and they still paid the same amount as the rest of us who were full of sushi."

NOT HERE! Liked it all! They had my favs and usuals, scallop roll, poke, and garlic tuna. Poke was good and they give a nice size amount for one serving, garlic tuna had too much ginger and the scallops were cooked, not what I'm used to but they were all pretty tasty. The dessert was pretty good on the AYCE too. I think it was called the Island Special, basically ice cream and fruit. Simple but refreshing! \n\nThe quality of the sushi was good, service was good and the restrooms were clean but c'mon, put some hand soap in the bathroom! They had a sink and paper towels but no soap, what in the heck?! Sorry, had to knock a star off for that, I'm a level 4 germ-a-phobe so it was real bothersome that I had to use my hand sanitizer rather than use what's supposed to be available to you by health department standards. \n\nOne other thing that I was pretty disappointed with what that this place is called Island Sushi and a majority of the people that come in to eat here get AYCE sushi but-- they didn't include the malasadas in the AYCE Menu. Not a big deal but I would've rather have had them... Been awhile since I've had them :(\n\nWord to the wise... You have to decide whether or not you want AYCE right away, they're sticklers for it. My sister-in-law ordered edamame and then decided that she wanted AYCE after the order had been put in and and they said that they had to charge her for it because they \"can't\" change it out."

In Nov 2014, I think I spent over $200 visiting this restaurant because of all the family we had visiting.\n\nI have been coming to this restaurant for the past four years, before I even moved to Vegas. Two reasons why:\n\n1. I'm a noodle head and they have really good fried noodles. Noodles like I used to get from the manapua truck when I was a kid but with more char sui, spam and kamaboko\n2. The POKE deli in the back. As far as I know, this is the only restaurant that has this, similar to all the supermarkets from HI. You can sample some of the different pokes they have. You even can choose to get a 1/4 lb of poke. This allows you to get all kinds of poke to taste!  And honestly, I would say that this is the original poke restaurant in Las Vegas. Although poke is the current trend in Las Vegas and all these poke bowl restaurants are opening up. If you want authentic, original Hawaiian style poke, come here. Forget the rice and all the vegetables and load up on poke. Before I forget, the poke counter closes early than the restaurant, at 8pm.\n\nOne of my family favorites, malasadas. When you visit this restaurant, be sure to put your order in asap as it does take time to fry up these bad boys. Try the different filled flavors. Be sure you leave room for these delights at the end of your meal as it is best when it is fresh.\n\nAnd they did renovate the \"carry out\" portion of the restaurant. When I visited the restaurant last week, my family of 12 got there as soon as they opened up. We were able to take up two rows of tables with plenty of room for other patrons.\n\nBecause this is an extremely popular restaurant for the \"9th Islanders\", it is important that you plan ahead. Lunch, dinner and weekends, this place is poppin'."

            "review": "I'm pretty loyal to my regular sushi joint and I don't care for AYCE but after hearing so many good things about Island sushi I decided to give them a try.\n\nThe theme of the evening was: small. Maybe Im not used to the AYCE portion sizes but the nigiri sushi and rolls were really small. Even my malasada sundae was small with only a little scoop of ice cream in a little cup. \n\nIsland sushi has a strict policy that you must pay for anything you don't finish so not sure why the portions are small. The fish was fresh and the rolls were good, nothing spectacular though. We also ordered the hamachi Kama which was nice to see on the menu (1 per person). You are also able to order many non-sushi items.\n\nThe service was very good and I also thought it was a pretty good value for $26.95 pp for dinner so that raised my rating to 3 stars. None of the sushi was outstanding or blew me away though.  I guess AYCE just isn't for me."

We ended up sitting down anyways and I order 2 rolls... But then I try to order more and they refused to serve me. They said that they already put the food away and they are done making food for the night, yet there was still 20 minutes left to order food. They didn't even warn me that they were closing the sushi bar or offer to make me anything else before closing down. The sushi wasn't bad but I was extremely disappointed with the customer service. They lied to us and were too lazy to even serve me when they were supposed to be open. Worst service I have ever had. Next time I'm hungry for sushi I'll make sure Island Sushi is my last resort."

            "review": "Recently I have been an adventurous eater set out to explore the Hawaiian restaurants in the ninth island of Las Vegas. It all started with a few visits to L&L Barbecue that got me hooked on the Hawaiian plate lunch. On a couple of recent weekends, my adventures in dining led me to Island Sushi and Grill. \n\n   Island Sushi and Grill is located along the thriving Eastern Avenue Corridor south of Interstate 215 between the signalized Serene and Richmar intersections on the east side. It is in a small shopping center that doesn't draw much attention to the business. The first impression of Island Sushi and Grill from the outside is that it is a fancy sushi restaurant. It is a false impression because inside Island Sushi and Grill is a diverse dining experience. \n\n   Island Sushi and Grill is really two different restaurants that are divided into two rooms. The first room when you enter is a Hawaiin restaurant with pastries and take out sushi. There are a few long tables and two counters. The counter close to the door is where you order the Hawaiin food. The counter toward the back by the condiments and beverage machine is the sushi counter. The room to the right is a full service restaurant offering sushi and other entrees. In summary Island Sushi and Grill is a restaurant specializing in two areas of food: sushi and Hawaiin food. Pertaining to my experiences I experienced the plate lunch dinners on my two visits prior to penning this review/reporting of experiences. \n\n   On visit number one, I exchanged around $10 for a garlic chicken plate lunch with fountain beverage then a week later on visit number two, I exchanged around $10 on a chicken with eggplant plate lunch with fountain beverage. Being that they are plate lunches they included white rice and macaroni salad. The food was served in a styrofoam box that I brought to the table after they called my order. On both visits the chicken met my expectations. For safe measure, I added schirachi sauce to it just as I added soy sauce to the rice. L&L has far better macaroni salad and Ross J's  Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue serves far larger portions. This is the first restaurant that my food adventures led me that offered chicken with eggplant. It seemed to be chicken over eggplant with a lot of white rice around it and a little cup of macaroni salad nearby. \n\n   Being an adventurous eater, I foresee many more restaurants to explore. Before I set sail for further dining adventures, my report on dining two times in Island Sushi and Grill is that it is a three star  experience."

She then asked what was wrong and we stated that the fish tasted sour and the rice tasted like it has been sitting out for a couple of days. Instead of being apologetic she said \"well the rice was made this morning, I know I was here and I'm not going to charge you for the extra for the leftovers\" with an attitude I might add. We asked for our bill and I told her we are not coming back and I did not give her a tip. You would think with our complaint they would have given us a discount or something.

The all you can eat was $21.95.  Here's what I got for lunch:\n\nChicken Katsu- Very good.  Light and crispy, their katsu sauce was sweet and AH-MAZE-ING!\n\nHamachi (yellow tail) Nigiri- I know it's fish, however, it tasted a lot more fishier than I'm used to.  This makes me think if it was fresh or not...\n\nAhi poke- I know there's a poke express right next door.  I don't think this poke was made from them.  I didn't think it was very good.  The Ahi seemed to be a little old.\n\nGeso (fried squid legs with a spicy aioli)- This was GOOOODD!  Whenever I order fried calamari, I always enjoy eating the smaller calamari with legs.  This dish was just legs!  YUM-O.  The menu says spicy aioli but it wasn't spicy at all...BUT DELICIOUS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nGarlic Chicken- Sweet teriyaki and garlic sauce all over fried boneless chicken thigh pieces.  Sweet, savory and crispy all at the same time.  ON POINT!\n\nGyoza- Crispy fried pork pot stickers served with a ponzu (sweet/citrus based soy) sauce.  I love the thin, watery consistency of the ponzu.  Goes well with the crispy gyoza.\n\nMalassada sundae- Definitely a MUST TRY!  First they cut the malassada (fried donuts without the hole and dusted with sugar) in four wedges and fan it out in a bowl.  A scoop of ice cream is placed in the center with a whipped cream topping and the dish is finished with a guava sauce and cut strawberries.  Such an AH-MAZE-ING ending!\n\nI do enjoy the fact that Island sushi is separated into two sections.  One section for just the sushi bar and another section for plate lunch/bento/fast food type service and poke express.  These sections are night and day and appeals to all sorts of diners.  If you are looking for a place that exposes you to Hawaiian-local cuisine, this is definitely the place to go to."

I really enjoyed the spicy tuna avocado one. The fish was good quality and had a nice texture but I wished there were more fish/avocado and less of the spicy mayo. \n\nThe parking lot can sometimes get crowded as can the restaurant so try and come early or later in the evening.

Inside of the restaurant is sectioned off in to two areas. Entrance area seems to be designated for traditional Hawaiian grilled dishes, and the area thru the door on the right is the sit down sushi area. We came here on a Friday night and it was packed. They do have a wide selection of AYCE sushi and many sides to choose from (although the sides appear to be half of what you'd get if you were ordering a la carte).\n\nThe AYCE menu has two symbols that denote different things. Chopsticks next to the item indicate it is a dinner only item, while the sushi icon indicates it is one order per person.  The rolls were fine and fish relatively fresh. One thing to note is their speciality rolls were in fact not drenched in Yum sauce or mayo concoctions of any sort. A lot of what we ordered had their garlic sauce on the roll itself, and I wasn't a fan. It tasted like gin ...I know strange.  \n\nWe sample several rolls: Joe's Special, Black Widow, Spicy Mexican, Lava Lover, Lasagna, Surf and Turf. I also had their scallop mayo and salmon nigiri. The salmon was fresh, the scallop mayo was very bland and forgettable. My favorite roll of the group was Spicy Mexican, the rest were decent, but nothing I would rush to eat again.\n\nThe service was fine, minus the initial hiccup. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our first three rolls to the table. I know that it wasn't our servers fault, and it was pretty packed in there. They didn't bring it out roll by roll so we had food coming throughout, instead they waited for all rolls to be made before they brought them out. I guess it makes more sense that way, especially with being so packed.  So although, famished by the time we got the food, I won't hold it against them.\n\nI would recommend this place is you want more simple, non yum sauce heavy rolls with fresh fish and friendly service."

We had leftover teriyaki chicken, beef and rice, which will probably be a snack for hubby later after his nap. \n\nPROS:\n-Food cooked fresh\n-The teriyaki chicken was delish!  Next time hubby wants just teriyaki chicken. :)\n-I loved the Furikake rice in the bento box! \n\n\nCONS:\n-Long wait to get food (that's what happens when you show up right at lunch time 12:00pm)\n-I wasn't too fond of the Mac salad--too dry, not seasoned well. Tasted like it was made a few days earlier and just stored in the fridge. \n-ran out of some poke I wanted to try \n\nEating here sure beats hubby's suggestion of P.F. Chang's for lunch.  Thanks fellow Yelpers!  I guess we'll have to come back for malasadas and salmon poke next time. :). Like tomorrow?  LOL!"

The first time my boyfriend and i sat at the sushi bar for late night happy hour which is from 9-close.  Half priced rolls and 1.50 for beers! Even imports like sapporo.\nMy Favorite roll that i had to go back for was the alaskan roll. They put ikura on top which is a delicious twist.  So we ordered 4 rolls and my boyfriend had a beer and our bill was $20.  unbeatable price.  The sushi is good, and even really good for a local joint,  but i give it four stars b/c quality wise, it cant compete with places like nobu.\nThe second time we tried out the grill part of the restaurant.  We ordered the saimen combo with garlic chicken and loco moco.  The loco moco was awesome.  The saimen, was so so, i've had a lot better.  The garlic chicken was also delicious.  \nThe 3rd time we went back for the sushi happy hour and it was great.  We started with the tuna poke and miso soup, both very good.  Four sushi rolls and 3 beers.  The bill was thirty something dollars.  \nWe will definitely go back if we are craving affordable sushi and dont feel like driving to the strip, but its not the best quality of sushi."

Fried tofu in their poke sauce with onions! (SOOO GOOD! Lol)\nMalasada Sundae - the malasada (aka Hawaiian donut) tasted like cardboard, was dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for days.. Strawberries were sweet and the vanilla ice cream.. Was just ice cream.. Not a fan.\n\nSushi chefs were attentive but the waiters/waitresses were not..

With that being said the manager which was a Japanese female came out towards our table and said \"before you start talking let me say what I have to say first\"... really?!!

This is clear across town from where I live, but worth the drive every once in a while. I have been reading the reviews for the place and it had me so excited! Finally, for my bf's birthday, who is a sushi fanatic, we tried Island Sushi.\n\nI like the idea of hawaiian fusion mix. We got here, a small sushi restaurant connected to Poke Express, and sat at the bar. We arrived around 4:15p, so it was still early and there weren't many people here at all. I think our sushi chef, Terrence, seemed like an owner or something. Not sure, but he was awesome! I told him it was our first time there and we had heard about it from Yelp, and he explained everything to us and gave us a special treat in the end.\n\nSo first off, we are Uni fans. HAD TO try the uni. It was fresh! Also had the hamachi and salmon. And some other stuff, don't remember. But everything was fresh. They also had a good variety of appetizers to choose from, different types of poke, some traditional sushi apps, and some hawaiian type apps. We ordered... hamachi kama (not a big fan but it wasn't bad), eggplant fries (YUM!!), crab poke (didn't know how to eat it!), little fried octopus (like calamari and it was super yummy! it looked cute too), also.. a couple other things. Can't remember it all, but nothing disappointed me at all. Some went far above expectations.\n\nFor the rolls, they had a decent variety and we couldn't decide what to try. They don't really do half orders (only on your last roll you can do a half). So Terrence asked us what we liked and just made some rolls for us. One had hamachi inside and outside and it was great. Also had the Big Island Roll. Did a half order of one the soft shell crab rolls (don't remember the name) and then there was another roll, but don't remember.\n\nAnd then the desserts! We were limited to one dessert each which was a bummer. Yama Sushi is unlimited but they don't have the variety like Island Sushi! I got the 808 rolls after seeing all the pictures of it. Its deep fried banana with ice cream and whipped cream with fresh strawberries and chocolate syrup. My bf got malasadas (deep fried dough) with ice cream and whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Delicious! Not to mention they gave us mini puffs because we are yelpers! (well at least I am).\n\nOverall, great experience. Their prices are decent. And they gave my bf half off since it was his birthday (we didn't even ask for it). Terrence is great! And the food was fresh and delicious. The servers were nice and the food came out quickly. If only they had a location closer to me, but you can't have everything right? I would go back to this place weekly if I could, but my waistline would not be happy with that. But I definitely recommend this place to everyone.\n\nALSO!! Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday they have 1/2 off rolls all day. Other days they have half off rolls certain hours for happy hour. Check their website for specials. And they have a full bakery attached to Poke Express (same place). Yum."

They also have over 20 rolls to choose from they kind of cut it tiny but i guess thats good if you want to try alot of their rolls. \ni recommend the CANDYCANE roll:]\n         \nGESO!! omgahh you cannot go here without getting gesos (which are baby octopus goodness!) \n\nThe only down side would be their nigiri. Last time i ate there the salmon wasnt fresh :[. but sometimes it is. but if this place isnt all that if your crazy for nigiri ive had way better quality in other sushi joints. Also their service could be slow and youll have to be patient if there is alot of people, their really nice though. \nBut other than that this placeee is really really YUMMMY!! \nThe sushi chef even gave me and my boyfriend complimentary SAKE BOMBS!! woot. \n\nand again. TRY THE GESO!!!"

Very accommodating with the 10 friends we had, started with a couple appetizers for everybody: spicy tuna with pickled daikon, ahi poke, baked mussels, garlic chicken, Kim chii fried rice, yaki soba, spicy raw crab (yummy), hamachi Kama, sashimi salad and that's just appetizers.   On to the Nigri sushi all fresh and perfectly made: hamachi, yellowtail, Cajun albacore, ebi, amaebi, salmon skin hand roll.....whole lotta goodness in just two entrees. For the grand sushi rolls we ordered the maKaha, big island, kahuku and more than we can't seem to remember due to being comatose. \n\nOh let me mind you that they do offer an AYCD on sake!!!  What?!?!?!  Yes all you can drink sake!!!!  Great food and get drunk, how can you complain. Let's not forget the dessert: 808 special!!!  So yum yum and you can even take some cocoa puffs. \n\nHard to find great sushi spots and we've grown to love this place.  Will definitely keep going back especially with the start of their punch cards. Auryte!!!!!"

I always feel like I'm back home when I'm here. \n\nThis review is mainly for the grill side of Island Sushi & Grill. I have had AYCE sushi here during Sunday Brunch and it was good, but it was a while back (5+ years ago). At that time it was a good price, lots of options for rolls and breakfast food. It may have changed since then. \n\nGRILL SIDE: \n- My favorites are the korean chicken, garlic chicken, chicken & eggplant, & teri beef plates. \n\n- The ahi plate is a bit dry but can be improved. \n\n- The malasadas are great. Freshly made and an assortment of filled malasadas to choose from: chocolate, haupia, and custard. \n\nI love the renovations. It looks great! I like the option of quick service on the grill side with tables to dine in as well. I usually order takeout by phone and swing by to pick up when it's ready."

AYCE susi with a taste of Hawaii. Hawaiians are known for being laidback and friendly. \n\nThere were plenty of empty tables when we got there yet, we had to wait for a table. Really? We placed out order. Some items took forever but some we never got. I guess our previous server was finishing up his shift but didn't notify us. We tried a few nigiri, rolls, teri beef sliders, garlic edamame, ahi poke, salmon katsu and malassadas. We didn't order that much but we spent 2 hours total here.\n\nLunch AYCE is from 11:30am-4pm for $21.95 and dinner AYCE is from 4pm-close for $26.95. There are certain items that are only available for dinner, limit 1/person, 2 desserts/person and there's a 90-minute limitfor AYCE. With service slower than molasses, you'll easily go over 90 minutes! \n\nThe food was good but the service really turned us off. My boyfriend is very calm and laidback and for him to even say something about the service says a lot. The female server was borderline rude. No smile on her face, no nothing. The servers don't even look up to see if anyone in the restaurant needs something. They walk around with their head down or pretending to be busy. 3 servers and 5 tables, c'mon!"

However, with a bigger group, reservations are recommended.  I always opt for all-you-can-eat sushi, which is $26.95 for dinner.  It's worth it for me because after you eat a couple of rolls, you end up saving money.  However, I know not everyone has my appetite...\n\nWhat's great about this restaurant is that the sushi is not overloaded with rice, HOWEVER, most orders come with about eight large pieces of sushi.  The value is there because there is a fair amount of filling and toppings, but you may be surprised with the size/amount that comes in one order!  This is the only downside.\n\nI typically order: California Deep Fried Roll, Island Special Roll, Poke Roll, Spam Roll, and the Town & Country Roll.  Yes, all at one time.  Yes, I get my money's worth.  Yes, I gain ten pounds immediately and roll myself home.  All of them are fresh, delicious, and feature a wonderful array of flavors that complement each other perfectly (e.g. sweet, spicy, salty - yum).\n\nBeware that they do charge $2 per piece that you do not finish.  The strategy I found to have worked best is to order everything you think you want to eat at once.  If you wait to think about it, there could be a delay in your order, and once that food begins to settle... defeat is inevitable.  If I order the aforementioned all at once (read: 40 large pieces of sushi), I am able to finish it once I get on a roll (pun intended).  Also, remember to follow-up on your rolls!  Once they didn't bring a roll that I forgot about until the end, and I was so overwhelmed.\n\nAs for dessert, I always have the 808 Special!   I just love tempura banana - something I have never had before!  My friend had the tempura ice cream, but we both agreed it wasn't as flavorful.\n\nIf you're looking for a Hawaii-feel, the ambiance is great! I believe they play KWXX radio (read: Hawaiian/local music), and everyone is extremely friendly.  I know there's a take-out portion of this restaurant as well with plate lunches, poke bowls, and the like, but I have not tried that yet.  YOU NEED TO GO HERE!"

I'd say probably in the top 3. The dinner is almost $30, but you do get a wider selection of choices known as the \"dinner selection items\" which are not available during lunch. Also items marked with a hashtag have a one item per person restriction. \n\nI got about 25 items and I recommend getting the crunch and black widow roll. The eel, ebi, and salmon nigiri was really good too. The hot lava roll was not good at all because it didn't have much taste besides spiciness and the inside of the roll had a red paste texture. \n\nAnother highlight was each person gets up to two dessert items which was a first for me at an AYCE sushi. Be sure to try the green tea ice cream (strong green tea taste) and the malasada sundae! Malasada is kinda like a Hawaiian donut that reminds me of a cross between a donut and churro. The tempura ice cream was okay because they only have vanilla ice cream and the fried shell was kinda soggy.\n\nOverall, the experience was very nice and I would go back here again. The only downer about this place is the appearance. When you first walk in it looks like a small bakery place with the main dining area on the right side. It has a hole in the wall sort of feel which is okay, but the other AYCE places I have been to have a more classy atmosphere and they even had lower prices haha. Either way the most important thing is the food right? Definitely give this place a try if you are craving sushi with a good selection of appetizers, side dishes, and desserts."

She didn't offer us out desert and just asked us if we wanted the bill at the end- we felt like we were being rushed! \n\nOn top of all that she over charged us on our drinks and I when I tried explaining it to her she ignored me and started talking to another person in our party WHILE I WAS STILL TALKING.

All day happy hour with 50% off all rolls (not the AYCE) Mon - Wed. for the lighter eater.  Plate lunches are very reasonable averaging $7.50.\n\nGreat place when you're jonesing for a taste of Hawaii."

All of them were amazing. \n\nEvery Monday and Thursday they have 50% your bill and that knocked our $300 bill to $150. We were pretty damn pleased.\n\nI walked out feeling great, not stuffed.

The restaurant is split into two sections: the grill side - which serves casual meals - and the actual sushi restaurant. Their poke orders in the grill side are always fresh, and my favorite food to get from there is the spicy tuna bowl! As for the sushi restaurant, the AYCE may be a bit pricey, but everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - on the menu is included in it. My favorite appetizer from there is the fried oysters. If you're sitting at the bar, one of the chefs may make a surprise dish for you, if you're lucky. Rolls are either hit or miss - they may be some \"interesting\" sushi rolls, but the rolls that are hits are very tasty! Customer service is also very good. I've been there in large groups several times before, and they definitely know how to handle them!"

Most places are run by indifferent Chinese or Korean people who just want to give you whatever can pass for sushi and then charge you as much as they can for it, or deep fry everything to mask the fact that none of the fish is very fresh.\n\nIsland Sushi is different. As far as I can tell, everything was nice and fresh, service was good, the appetizers were amazing (thus providing a more diversified AYCE experience than just eating roll after roll), and of course they still have to cut their losses somehow so there is a 90 minute time limit which I am totally okay with.\n\nWe stumbled out of this place satisfied and not feeling cheated, and went off to digest while firing AK47s at the Gun Store.

I wished that they had a seating area for pickup. But the man got tired of waiting and from what I understand, they messed up and forgot his order, he waited... and he waited too long!

If in her mind she didn't remember me ordering, shouldn't she have assisted me to see what I needed? So I told her and then she remembers. She ran back to the kitchen and came to me and apologized and said a couple more minutes. I waited about another 15 minutes and my order still didn't come. And the girl just ignored me. I could have thrown a fit like the guy did but I realized how embarrassed they were after he did that. So I stayed patient. The owner comes to me and asks me again what was I waiting on. Are you kidding me? Did they forget my order again? After I tell them for the second time, I see him going back to scoop up my poke, literally 3 minutes later he finally comes with my order. \n\nI will not be coming back. 40 minutes wait and the poke wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the wait.

Not too dry, a little crispy outside, pretty good.\n\nDessert is pretty good, creme brulee, 808 special (fried banana w ice cream), tempura ice cream. \n\nService is pretty good, considering on how busy it was, they did pretty good job, refilling the drinks. Although, they don't remember which sushi goes to which person, they almost don't care actually.

We got there for lunch, but decided to do the dinner ayce instead.  4 bucks more and you get uni, amaebe, and so much more... what an awesome deal!  Like other reviewers had mentioned, they don't try to fill you up with rice.  The nigiri was definitely awesome, with the fish totally covered the small pile of rice.  You definitely get your money worth!  The hamachi kama was really awesome.  My bf, who does not eat ayce (strictly sashimi only), thought this place was great."

They said they would and it would be ready for pick up in two hours. the cake looked appealing with the shredded dry coconut flakes around the rim of the cake. The cake was the highlight of my entire dessert table and all my guests would not stop raving over how delicious it was. It was fairly priced at $20.

We had a one year old baby with us who is very picky with food so we had to bring fries with us from a fast food restaurant. The woman who brought us to our table told us that we cannot have outside food inside Island Sushi but I explained to her that it is just food for the baby and to please just let us keep it. She said she would have to ask her manager if that was okay. She spoke to the manager and he came to our table and told her our baby can't keep the food because it is their \"policy\". So for the next hour, our baby just sat there hungry while everyone ate. \n\nSo we ordered our food and our first roll got to our table. But none of us can eat because they didn't provide any plates. We sat for a while waiting for someone to come by and nobody came. My sister stood up and went to the front and told them we didn't have plates. They took 5 mins after to finally bring plates. Next, they brought my niece's fish but she couldn't eat it because they didn't bring any forks. We waited again for someone to come by and after 5 minutes, my husband stood up to ask for forks at the front. And it kept getting worse. We ordered rice with the fish but that didn't come until 15 minutes later after the fish. The miso soups didn't come until 20 minutes after we ordered (which if you go to sushi restaurants often, you know that's the first thing they place on your table). They did not give wasabi and ginger until we asked for it (again, sushi restaurants ALWAYS give this automatically) and when they gave us the wasabi, it didn't come with any bowls so my husband had to get up again to the sushi table to ask for one. In total, our family had already gotten up 3 times to ask for stuff. Halfway done through our food, we had to remind them that they still haven't brought 2 rolls that we ordered. Only the manager checked up on us once. Nobody else asked if we needed anything, which is weird considering there were only about 20 people in the restaurant so they weren't that busy for us to be ignored. \n\nWorse yet, the food was horrible. The sushi tastes like the refrigerated ones you can buy at grocery stores. The raw fish were thin and dry. We paid half price for them because of Happy Hour but even so, their sushi is not worth it. \n\nNever coming back to this place again. The only good thing about this place is that the employees were friendly, the manager especially. My guess is that they're just unorganized and forced to follow stupid rules by the owner."

The sushi is small and the spider roll that i order had a really strong fishy taste to it which is not normal. So that really brought it down another star.\n\nService was not good at all. There were only two sushi chefs and not alot of people, it took forever for the sushi to come out.

Unfortunately, we weren't that impressed and wrote them off. Then about a year ago a friend said that IS has opened up a grill section on the opposite side of the sit down restaurant with a very different menu filled with local plate lunch favorites. We heard a lot of good things about their plate lunches, so we had to give them a try.\n\nWe walked in during a lunch rush and the first thing I noticed is how empty the sushi and sit down area was and how packed the new grill section was.  I looked over the new menu and was impressed. They had everything...breakfast plates, saimin, burgers, bentos, and many of the plate lunches you would eat in Hawaii.  They also had a dessert case with all kinds of sweets...cakes (chantilly, guava, & haupia), mochi, cocoa puffs (don't do it, they are FAR from Liliha Bakery's gems!), and cookies. And they do make malasada's and they are pretty good. We also had AYCE ($20.99/ person) lunch sushi menu which was very good for the price. They also have a Poke Express in the back of the restaurant.  If you are hosting any party, this is where you should get your poke. They have a wide variety of poke dishes, ahi, tako, shoyu, crab, etc.\n\nOur favorites:\nGarlic or Mochiko chicken\nAhi Belly is ono\nHamburger steak\nBentos for $8 you can't go wrong. \nTako Poke \nLove their breakfast menu- Loco Moco with fried rice\n\nIsland Sushi Specials: menu\nHappy Hour\n50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday     All Day\n \nDrink Specials\n$3.00 Large Beer\n$2.25 Hot Sake\n$4.00 Saketini\n#1.50 Small Beer\n$2.00 Sake Bomb\n \nSushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch\nAYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95\nSundays                    11:30 AM - 3:00 PM\n \nAYCE Lunch & Dinner\nLunch-$20.99\nDinner-$24.95\n\nIf you had an ok experience with IS, you should give them another shot.

And considering it was $24.95, you bet I was gonna stuff myself. All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this. \n\nThe place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full. Service was pretty good though considering it was busy. Our waitress came by often to get us more water or take more orders for the all-you-can-eat dinner. If I remember it right, sake bomb shots were $2. Keep in mind it comes in a glass with the beer already. \n\nTheir salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll. Do yourself a favor and get the tempura ice cream for dessert. It's pretty damn awesome, so save room for that. Yeah. I'd go again, but I'd like to try something else too."

(Lunch is $20.99/pp.)  \n\nWhen you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.\n\nAfter being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  \n\nAppetizers: \n* Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!\n* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!\n* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!\n* Edamame\n* Garlic Chicken\n* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)\n* Pork Gyoza\n* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)\n* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)\n\nNigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it.\n* Albacore\n* Amaebi (limit one order per person)\n* Garlic Tuna\n* Hamachi \n* Hirame\n* Ika\n* Ikura\n* Saba\n* Sake\n* Scallop Mayo\n* Tai\n* Uni (limit one order per person)\n\nThings we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.\n\nEveryone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.\n\nI wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.\n\nThey are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   \n\nYou are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.\n\nService was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.\n\nThey also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.\n\nWhat makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.  \n\nHappy Hour: 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials\nMondays to Saturdays: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 9:00 PM - Close\nSunday: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 8:00 PM - Close\n\nLadies' Night: Drink Specials Only\nWednesdays: 3:00 PM - Close\n\nDrink Specials: \n$3.00 Large Beer\n$2.25 Hot Sake\n$4.00 Saketini\n$1.50 Small Beer\n$2.00 Sake Bomb\n\nSushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch: AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95\nSundays: 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM"

Your trying to enjoy the food and socialize at the same time not just scarf food down fast as I can because of the time restraint.\nWhen there are 20 plus in your group the food takes a while to come out also. \n\nMy friends who used to love Islands, also have had some bad experiences as the service not being as good as it used to be when they first opened up.  \n\nThe food is pretty decent but because of the time restraint, it's not a good place for large groups in my opinion since I have tried. I know most Vegas sushi places the have a time limit for all you can eat and Islands is a little more generous with the time but huge groups it doesn't help.\n\nI prefer to go to Sin city sushi across the street, even though Sin city is tiny there is no time limit on the all you can eat and we can relax socialize and enjoy the food without any pressure to hurry.  The food is just as good as Islands or better. The fish being fresher in my opinion."

Bentos are served just like how you would get them in Hawaii & a pretty packed plate for the price.

If you plan to order both food and poke you can tell the counter person and they will send it over to the \"food\" section and you will get rung up once.  There were authentic local Hawai'i people behind the counters at this place (I could tell) so you know they know what they're doing.  There is a place to sit inside very casually or you can go to the restaurant next door and dine in there - looks like a resto/sports bar atmosphere.  \n\nI got the Bento B, which comes with Garlic Ahi, (1) Chicken Option, Noodles, Takuwan, Furikake Rice, and 1 piece Spam.  I chose the Mochiko Chicken as my chicken option.  Lots of food in this bento and very filling.  Great taste, which reminds me of home, so it's a winner in my book.

It's clams, scallops, and shrimp covered with spicy mayonnaise and onions and baked. Their desserts are also quite tasty. I always order the 808 special. It's a combination of strawberries and bananas fried in tempura batter with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. My hubby ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e once and it was laughably small, slightly larger than a half dollar coin! Mocha ice cream is also very good. \n\nThe only reason I knocked off a star is because of the service. They always take forever to refill drinks and the waitress there is often rude.

He was attentive and after telling him that it was our first time there, he ordered some of the most popular appetizers and rolls for us to try. They were all terrific!\n\nFOOD\nWhile our server was super amazing, kitchen people were super slow. We waited over 30 minutes for our sushi. Yes I understand the place was packed but I've never waited that long at a sushi place. I was surprised to see that for AYCE, you only get 90 minutes limit. LOL are you kidding me. Half the time is spent waiting for food. Anyways, appetizers were good but sushi was ok. Some of my favorites were:\n\n-Poke Roll\n-Garlic chicken (must try)\n-Salad (pieces of tuna and salmon in it. It was delicious!)\n-Joe's special\n\nI felt like some of the sushi weren't that fresh. Having raised in Japan, I've had some good sushi and know what fresh sushi taste like-this wasn't it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot the best but not the worst either. If you are not willing to wait 30 minutes for some sushi, I suggest Makinos for no wait & fresh sushi!"

Plate came with 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of sweet bread and 2 eggs of choice. I felt that rice to meat ratio was off. SOOO much rice, which may be good for some but just felt that there wasn't enough sausage. \n\nEverything served on styro containers which makes it easy to To-Go any left overs. No one else was dining at the time we were there (Sunday morning at 9am) but there were few people who came in for pick up and even more at the Poke counter. \n\nWhat I would really like to RAVE about is the MALASADAS. I ordered the dozen (about $15) 6 plain, 2 custard filled, 2 choco filled and 2 haupia filled. I noticed they were pulled from a box stamped with there logo so I'm hoping this is there recipe and creation. I would die if I ever came and was told there were no more, waahhhhh ! Employee pulled out a large tub of custard and injected the plain ones.\n\n They were so delicious, I'm tempted to type the rest of this review in all CAPS. They were moist, chewy, fluffy and soft. After bringing them home and being kept in the fridge, we would nuke em' in the micro for 30 seconds and they were just HEAVEN. Not tough or rubbery at all. Knowing this has encouraged me to take home at least 2 dozen next time. \n\nThough the dishes didn't make my mouth water, I'll be back for some Poke and A LOT more Malasadas!"

Both times seating was ready and available. Waitresses were nice and so were the chefs at the bar. The only dispute I have is with the miso soup. Way, *way* too salty for its own good.

Malasadas are made of egg-sized balls of yeast dough that are deep-fried in oil and coated with granulated sugar. They are popular in Hawaii and since Las Vegas is considered the \"9th Island\" you can definitely find them in Vegas...  I was craving the famous Leonard's malasadas found in Oahu, so when my husband visited the in-laws in Vegas, I asked him to find some of these yummy treats and bring some back home to the Bay Area.\n\nMy only concern was the fear of being disappointed by what he brings back... boy was I happy!  He came back with some haupia filled Malasadas that felt like it weighed half a pound each.  Haupia is a type of coconut custard, and it was perfect inside these warm slightly crispy Malasadas.  The custard was not too sweet, therefore, i scarfed down like 4 of them... *oops!* **blush**was I supposed to save some for the kids? Overall, they are still not as good as Leonard's but they definitely \"fit the bill\" when it came to cravings..\n\nI cannot wait to try the rest of the food here in person.  BOOKMARK!"

I would say that the bento box prices are slightly higher than other places, but they give you more food than most - so its pretty fair.\n\nWe ordered the one of the meals that came with 3 items (we got the fried scallops, the veggie tempura, and beef teriyaki).  The fried scallops were sooo good!  I would come back just for those... they were large and had a great flavor.  The veggie tempura was good (it came with two huge pieces of sweet potato which is my fav kind).  Beef teriyaki was better than most places, but nothing to rave about in my opinion.  We had California rolls and a tuna roll on the side - pretty standard.  \n\nFor dessert, we got the 808 special.  It's like a banana split, but with fried banana.  LOVED it!

Sushi is great, the plate lunches are great, the desserts are great, poke is great, all of their food is great. You shouldn't even question if you should come here or not."

The garlic chicken wasn't overpowering with garlic, but still had great flavor.\n\nI had regular saimin with a spicy tuna roll on the side. The saimin was normal; I liked that the noodles weren't overcooked. The spicy tuna roll was good, with a good chunk of tuna in each piece and the right amount of spice.\n\nLastly, we shared butter mochi. Which oddly is like biting into a stick of butter, except it's delicious.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful, gleaming with aloha spirit! We want to try malasadas and creme puffs next time."

Not only did she double check, she would warn me each time she place a dish down that had either shrimp or crab. With so many people ordering, that was really going above and beyond. The food quality is very good. I was a little nervous going into an AYCE but it was really fresh. Everyone was happy with the food.There was not a bad dish on the table. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Las Vegas. Thank you Island Sushi and Grill!"

We really like the spicy tuna hand roll too and salmon skin roll. I've eaten at the grill side of the restaurant before and we love it all.

Also, sashimi salad and crab salad only available for the dinner price. The other sushi joints near the strip charges the lunch price and provides all of those. \n\nOrdered a bunch of sushi: albacore, tuna, white tuna etc. The fish was a teeny tiny very thin slice of fish on a very large piece of cold, hard rice. I had trouble swallowing the sushi. The quality of fish was ok. I got the dinner price and ordered the crab salad and the sashimi salad, compared to some of the other AYCE sushi joints, the sashimi salad is tiny, and only had very few pieces of fish. Really disappointing quality compared to the other places. Also, I ordered the sweet shrimp which only came with 1 piece, other sushi places gives 2 pieces and charges less. \n\nThe service was good, sushi chef was nice, BUT I was charged extra for hot tea! Many sushi joints gives complimentary hot tea. Really disappointing and will not come back anymore."

            "review": "Today we wanted to take a trek to Henderson area to visit a friend. I've been wanting to try this and it's right by their house (lucky them!). \n\nWith so many AYCE places, it's hard to pick and choose. Even having tried many, I couldn't really pick a \"best\", but had more of they're all good, but here's the pros and cons of each particular place kind of answer (IE- some have bomb apps but meh sushi, great nigiri but rolls and apps are boring). I'll go on a limb that this is the best that I've had since it meets a lot of points. \n\nFirst point- appetizers are interesting, and have a wide variety. Sure, sure. Come for nigiri to get \"moneys worth\" but it gets a bit repetitive that way. I think I get my worth through the variety of foods I get to eat. \n\nAhi Belly with Pepper Garlic- the sauce was light but not overwhelming that you can't taste the fish melty, fatty yumminess or the nice char.\nDeep Fried Geso- delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus is always a favorite for me.\nSalmon Lomi- it was just okay. It was more tomatos than anything.\nAhi Poke- very nice version. ordered 2!\nTako Kimchee- nice thin sliced octopus stirred in with kimchee.\nHamachi Kama- I love kama and theirs had such a good char and perfectly crispy skin\n\nNigiri- the fish was fresh. The plus to me was that they do nigiri smaller than average (dont worry- the rice to fish ratio is very fairly proportional). Now some people might be taken aback since were all used to largesse given in cuts but, the smaller cut is perfectly bite sized and gives the opportunity to sample more variety. Some of these restaurants serve a two bite nigiri and with the BFs braces and jaw he dislikes how he has to bite in half and break it to eat. \n\nStandouts:\nEscolar/Super White Tuna- pretty good. \nCajun Albacore- very nice seasoning and ponzu sauce\nCajun Tuna- this has the seasoning and then has a wasabi aioli which was quite unique and good\nYellowtail- this is one of my favorite fish and it was very fresh\n\nAll the rest were good too. Only one that was just okay was the mackerel which had a bit of a salty quality to it that isn't the norm. \n\n We also got a special chef creation which was also a highlight of the night- it was a thin slab of rice on nori that was toasted to a crispy cake and topped with spicy chunks of tuna, thin slab of avocado, a dot of siracha, and a sweet sauce- probably eel sauce. It was very nice textures and flavors together. \n\nRolls- not usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll with different toppings and sauce. Boring. They had some interesting rolls. We tried The Croc which combined a few favorite elements- it has some spice, it has soft shell crab, sweetness from some unagi. Pretty good. I would have gotten more, but between just the two of us, whole rolls is a lot to eat and we wanted variety. Next time when we bring our friends to share with. They don't do half rolls, except on your very last roll you want to order.  I kept getting my favorite handroll though- salmon skin which is lovely here. \n\nDessert- not just the standard ice cream or mochi, though they do offer that too. They have a malasada sundae, the 808 special and creme brulee. We got the malasada which was yummy and the creme brulee had nice flavors but it wasnt so solid as it should, more runny, but it was still good. \n\nI like that this place can satisfy appetizer people, nigiri people, roll people and even dessert people. It's that reason why I think this is my favorite that we can bring all types of ayce people and their needs can be met. It's $24.95, cheaper by a few bucks than most dinner ayce and I think has better quality than those that hit the $30 mark. They give you 90 minutes which I don't really need, but I just like places where they're not timing you....I think here they realize people like to pace and sometimes, you're just waiting for food since it's all made-to-order stuff. \n\nDid I mention the hospitality? The sushi chef/owner was very attentive, talkative and seems very cool. The staff never even let our ice teas hit halfway and came to check on us a few times to see if we want more appetizers from the kitchen. \n\nOooh if I lived on this side of town I will come by all the time! Since I don't, we just have to make day trips to Henderson more often! \n\nOnolicious food, Hawaiian hospitality- whats not to love?!  \n\nALOHA!"

Our server, Mariah, was there quickly with menus, took our drink orders, and brought us our iced teas quickly.  She answered the questions we had about items we were considering.\n\nWe order two sushi rolls and two side dishes.  The sushi rolls were the standard California roll and a Lava Lover roll which the menu describes as a spicy tuna cucumber roll topped w/ cajun ahi, chili paste & garlic ponzu.  Both rolls were good.  The more interesting of the two was the Lava Lovers roll.  It was not very spicy and carried just a small kick--wasabi being a good addition to the heat for me.\n\nThe two sides were mochiko chicken and teriyaki beef.  This was only the second time I had mochiko chicken and I liked it better than the first time I had it elsewhere.  There was not sweet sauce on the chicken.  Rather, it was served plain which was good.  The teriyaki beef was good with a topping of sesame seed for decoration and a small amount of flavor.\n\nWe couldn't leave without some dessert.  My friend ordered mango mochi and I got the malassada sundae.  My sundae was very good.  The malassada and the ice cream may have been overkill calorie wise, but ti was very tasty!\n\nI checked out their case and I know where I can buy poke in the future without having to drive to North Las Vegas where I got it once before. \n\nIsland is a solid place for sushi and other items from the Pacific."

Even though I already went on two other occassions earlier in the week, but it's all good.\n\nFor an AYCE, this is one of the better ones I've experienced.  Very extended menu for AYCE.  Included a wide array of appetizers, sushi, rolls, and desserts.  Only thing is that there are a few item which allowed 1 per person.  This was Uni, Amaebi, seared Ahi Toro, Hamachi Kama (large size, not small), Tako kim-chee, couple of rolls, and some other items. This place is where you ordefrfrom a menu , not a buffett line. Food is freshly made upon order.\n\nOver all, it wasn't bad.  The uni was surprisingly fresh.  Amaebi...tolerable.  Other fish items, not bad...not the best quality, but again, this is AYCE.  It also included some dessert, 808 special...good. So was the malsadas and creme brulee.  Best to order one of each to share.\n\nOf the 5 of us who ordered AYCE, we definitely got our moneys worth.  Better than the AYCE places here in LA (Joe's Sushi, todai).  Would I go back here if I return, yes if with a larger group who's not into paying $100 pp for omakase.  This place will do to get your fix for sushi...and then some."

The buffet included your choice of appetizers, sushi, and a choice of dessert. The food was pretty good for the price. We ordered lots of nigiri, different styles of poke, and 2 rolls - a total of 35 dishes. I loved the unagi, while my hubby enjoyed the uni. We had the ahi, fried tofu, kimchee tako, and raw crab poke. I liked the fried tofu and ahi poke the best. The desserts weren't very good. We had tempura ice cream and 808 special. The tempura batter fell off the ice cream. \n\nService was great! Our waitress kept on coming back to our table to see if we wanted to order more food. I'm glad that we weren't ignored. \n\nOne minor grip was that this restaurant charged for green tea - $1.50 per person. I'm not used to paying for green tea. \n\nYou need a car to get to this place since it is really far from the Strip. I would come back here again."

            "review": "One of the better AYCE sushi places I have tried. I came here for my daughter's 13th birthday because she wanted sushi.  I was thinking feeding a bunch of teenage girls, this could be expensive so I knew I wanted an AYCE option. I also wanted a place that served more than just sushi because let's face it, not everyone can get down on raw fish. I really think I chose the perfect place! Other than the shitty parking lot, and a few service hiccups, I would say we did pretty well. \nThere ended up being 10 of us. I only made a reservation for 8, and they accommodated us. It was a small squished area, and there was a bigger table they could have put us at, but whatever. It was my fault so I was not going to complain.\nThree of the girls went with a teriyaki chicken plate that was served with rice and mac salad. It was good. But I was there for the unlimited supply of garlic edamame, gyoza, tempura, tiger rolls, and oh my new favorite, the black widow roll. I did not even realized I like soft shell crab until this roll. They also had great dessert options like brownie sundaes, green tea ice cream, and creme brulee. \nThere were certain items you could only have one of, but AT LEAST they offer these items unlike other sushi places. (certain sashimis and desserts) And a few certain items that were only available for dinner. Which is a couple bucks more, but still a great price at $27 p/p. \nThe restaurant is small with a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese decor. The service was not bad. It was not amazing. They forgot a coke, and served us a roll 25 minutes after ordering it. They did not charge us for the 6 uneaten pieces of sushi which I was grateful for. Our total bill including 18% tip came to $300. For sure a decent price for 10 at a sushi spot. \nI can't wait to return without the kids, and indulge in their half price happy hour."

But this place is so worth the trip! All you can eat sushi, and they include a lot of fancy rolls! The quality is great and unlike other all-you-can-eat sushi joints, they don't leave out a lot of the more expensive choices! I definitely plan on going here every Vegas trip! \n\nOn a side note, this place is joined together with a Hawaiian plate restaurant that looks pretty decent itself. I might have to try it out next time. Nice Hawaiian music playing in the background too!"

The rolls were tasty and we ordered a LOT- to the point that I think our chef got frustrated, as we saw him walk off with a sour expression & another chef meekly replaced him.

We like the food, obviously. \n\nThe thing that started to bother me was every time we grab our pick up order, they ALWAYS forget things. Whether it's our somen salad dressing or Mac salad. Or they mess up our order. And we don't notice it til we open everything up when we get home. We usually brush it off and don't mind.\n\nBut today when my boyfriend grabbed our food, our combo hamburger meal came with a drink. My boyfriend didn't know. And I told him when he came home that we should've gotten a small drink. And we laughed at the sign that was stuck on the bag. We were like, really? It said they aren't responsible for the orders once the food leaves the restaurant.\n\nBeing that we are regulars at this establishment, and that they are ALWAYS FORGETTING things for our order. This was a slap in the face. \n\nWhy don't you guys just check the orders better. It's obvious this is a common mistake and that's why they put this note on all the food orders. \n\nUnreal"

Not in anyway demeaning the quality of fish or sides, but the rice to be honest, not that good. It's almost as if there is something added to the rice that just shouldn't be there. The rice to me, tastes funny, and I never complain because of how polite I am. So I will give them three stars until the quality and consistent size of rice improves.\n\nTerry,\n\nFish is always great. Love the white tuna, hamachi, and unagi. I try to taste at least one order of each. Rice machines are great. Which is why I have upped my review to four stars.  All this place needs to get to five stars is top notch service. I feel like I come sometimes and the line will be out the door but tables and the bar are open.  Sushi Chefs are top notch and are always great.

It's very creative and I plan to return, maybe during happy hour. \n\nFavorite rolls off of the all-you-can-eat menu:\nBig Island \nIsland Special\nBlack Widow\n\nI wasn't a fan of the Surf and Turf, the roll with beef teriyaki outside/shrimp tempura inside. Just didn't like that mix of flavors but other people in my party did. \n\nHad I done my homework, I would have tried the fried octopus and the spam sushi roll. How could I have Hawaiian food without Spam? \n\nThe Ahi belly was tasty. We ordered four of those, one for each of us. Even after 10 rolls, several appetizers, many plates of sushi, I polished off the Marssala dessert without even talking. I totally felt like a pig. I was a pig.\n\nI heard Island Sushi has an awesome brunch. Can't wait to try it. I would rank this place higher than Sushi Mon, for sure.  There was no wait to get in, the service is better, and I think the rolls are more creative. I can't compare it to I Love or Momo (apples and oranges)."

They don't have just sushi, they have other side dishes like mochiko chicken, kalbi, udon, edamame, etc. They pretty much have EVERYTHING :)\n\nI recommend the Hamachi Kama (grilled hamachi collar). It's limited one per person during dinner time, so you definitely have to order it! I love getting the Salmon, Tuna, and Hamachi nigiri. For dessert, get the 808 Special (Tempura Banana) or the Malasada Sundae. Soooo bomb\n\nHonestly everything here is SOOO GOOD. One of my favorite AYCE's in Vegas. It's a sit down sushi restaurant and you don't have to get the AYCE option but I highly recommend it. They also have a grill side of the restaurant where they have other choices of foods. Also check out Poke Express!"

We ordered 5 rolls, all delicious: tempura roll, spider roll, tekka maki roll, salmon lover roll, and the poke roll. Final cost was $30 with tax and tip for 2 people and I was surely satisfied. The tuna was realllllyyyyy good and all the tempura was super crispy. Service was also awesome! Can't wait to visit again...probably for AYCE!

The sushi here is really fresh, the food is great, and the service is awesome too. When I came here, the waiter even gave me a discount too because the sushi was taking a bit longer than usual to come out from the kitchen since the place was packed and the kitchen was a bit backed up. They even have my favorite chuka seaweed salad here too which you can order as much as you want.\n\nKeep in mind there is a time limit on how long you can eat. I think it was 1.5 hours but I'm not sure if they will enforce it or not. Also, you can only have 1 order per person for the sweet shrimp and uni sushi.\n\nExcellent food, excellent service, and not overpriced. Make sure to check this place out."

The right side of the restaurant opens at 11:30.  We chose to sit at the sushi counter in front of chef Jason.  He was friendly and quick in preparation.  We had a great lunch thanks to him! \n\nSince they have AYCE, it worked best for us to try several different creations.  Jason suggested the Hamachi which is yellowtail.  In the first bite there was a unique flavor.  We asked him what it was.  They combine orange and lemon into the yellowtail for this distinct flavor.  We immediately loved it.  \n\nThe 007 was our second choice.  Crab and cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado and eel sauce certainly made this a winner.  \n\nThe Island Special with soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce did not disappoint.  Incredible flavors from each roll this far! \n\nThe cherry on top was our final order of the Baked Salmon.  This is a California roll topped with cream cheese, salmon and dynamite.  It just melted in your mouth.  \n\nI cannot wait to come back and try some of their other choices.  I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every bite."

It's located away from all the busyness that is the Las Vegas Strip, it's decently priced, the fish is quality grade, and the AYCE menu is huge.\n\nEver since trying this joint out a couple years back, every trip to Vegas is not complete until we have a dinner at Island Sushi!  The staff is so friendly and attentive, the food tastes great, and the atmosphere just feels homey.\n\nThe latest time around, I decided to get only nigirizushi.  No rolls at all.  The menu for this AYCE is huge.  I had three rounds of several types of nigiri each round and still didn't make it thru the whole nigiri menu.  I didn't come across one I totally didn't like either.  Favorites would be the mackerel and the super white.  Oh so delicious.  \n\nThey have a huge appetizer menu as well.  For appetizers be sure to get a couple orders of the baked green mussels.  They add a little extra spiciness to theirs that make them so tasty.\n\nIf I remember correctly (from past visits) the rolls are pretty decent sized aren't heavy handed on the rice.  I like how they don't try to stuff you up with extra rice on rolls or even the nigirizushi.  They truly allow you an all you can eat experience.\n\nNothing ends a meal like a great dessert (again a decent size for an AYCE).  Only one per person, and you can't mix and match so, be sure to get the 808 special and the green tea ice cream.  Then you can have the 808 special with green tea ice cream!\n\nCan't have a trip to Vegas anymore without stopping by here at least once.  Thanks Island Sushi for the wonderful food and hospitality!"

The cooked food was good but it was very filling so I don't recommend it if you are on the AYCE plan.\n\nAnother problem was that they used the \"ajitsuke\" nori (the sweet and spicy flavored nori) for the Uni sushi. I don't know if this is \"hawaiian style\" or they were just plain lazy, but this is the only sushi restaurant that I have been to that uses ajitsuke nori for their \"gunkan\" sushi. And because of the flavor in the nori, it killed the flavor in the uni. \n\nThe presentation of the sushi was not like other sushi places too, in a bad way... Even I could probably cut the fish the way the chefs did. It didn't affect the taste, but come on!, they should've taken better sushi-making lessons before they started working behind the counter.\n\nIf you want to have AYCE sushi, I would recommend Makino, which is cheaper, or Sushi Mon, which tastes better."

Order from the Poke Express section complete with all your poke needs from Ahi, Salmon, Shrimp, Special combinations, and even cucumber kim chi for your veggie requirements.  My favorites are the Special Combination poke, and the Furikake poke.  The raw fish is fresh, and you can order by the 1/2 pound.  This gets pretty pricey though, and you can get pretty full if you just order a 1/2 pound of poke and maybe a 1/2 pound of cucumber kim chi.  Good for the no carb dieters!\n\n3. Sit down in their sushi restuarant and order sushi.  This I can't comment on because I haven't actually ordered from their menu.   \n\nMy stars are strictly for option 1 and 2.  If I try option and 3 and love it, I'll add my 5th star.  I'll be back for sure!!!!\n\n\nYelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (64/365)."

The butter mochi and chocolate malasadas are to DIE for.  \n\nThe AYCE sushi is the way that most people go but I never have enough of an appetite so on Mon-Wed I come for the 50% off rolls deal that they offer to locals.  It's a steal and is usually a better deal for someone like me who only gets 2-3 rolls max.  Only beef is that they don't do half rolls, which a lot of AYCE places will do to allow you to try more options.  I highly recommend the kahuku roll (topped with orgasm sauce) and the town and country roll (cali roll with garlic chicken on top).  I also love the lava lover for something spicy.\n\nWhat I like most is that they don't skimp on fish quality and they don't pile on the rice, even when we do the AYCE.  Plus they have the most extensive AYCE menu out there to include all of their amazing side items--poke, cucumber salad, teri chicken, etc.\n\nIf you happen to be in the area on a Sunday and want a great brunch, head to Island Sushi.  They have all you can eat AND all you can drink mimosas.  Just get there early, there's almost always a wait from the time they open until the end of brunch."

Every time we hit $30 worth of sushi the servers quit serving us. At Island Sushi they kept the food coming and it was AWESOME! Good lord their shrimp tempura was soooo goodddd! Like melt in your mouth good! The baked mussel was a bit spicy but still good! Japanese lasagna? GOOD! The servers were super nice and attentive! They kept asking us if we needed anything and would bring us anything we needed. They were also super nice about allowing us share with our 2 year old. Granted we didn't share everything with her, just the dessert, but still it was nice of them to allow us to share. We will definitely be back!!!"

We definitely loved the salmon lover roll.  Handrolls were okay (spider roll was overfried and came with krab which it wasn't supposed to but skipped kaiware and gobo which it was supposed to).  Nigiri was tiny but it is probably okay for AYCE since we could try more.  Saba wasn't my fave and that is usually my test of sushi quality.\nFor pupus we had so many things - eggplant \"fries\" with spicy miso, fried tofu, crispy rice cake with spicy tuna and avocado, strawberry salad, cold green tea soba, grilled ahi belly and green onions, ginger chicken lettuce wrap, kimchi fried rice, ahi poke, raw crab poke, Hawaiian sweet roll French toast, and so many other things I can't remember.  Desserts: 808 special (tempura banana, ice cream, strawberries), blueberry tiramisu, warm mango mochi and coconut ice cream....the list goes on.\nI had iced green tea which was very good.  Service was decent considering the amount of groups and ordering tons of things.  They were hard to find sometimes to refill drinks but otherwise very pleasant.  This was an indulgence but a good deal for brunch.  It says 90 min time limit but we were there for 2.5 hours :)"

Maybe 10 or so tables and a sushi bar. \nRecently, we went on a Sunday for brunch. In addition to the standard AYCE lunch menu, they also included a special menu with items such as guava french toast, raw crab poke, & salmon skin salad. They even had bottomless mimosas for $7.

A lot of old customers does not know (including myself) that Poke Express is no longer there.  Walked in thinking it was still Poke Express.  Quality and Service was horrible.\n\nI order some poke along with a side of rice.  My order was just sitting there while the lady behind the counter catered to new customers.  My order came out after my friends order (he ordered a poke bowl), which he had placed after me.  How hard is it to scoop some poke and rice then have a customer pay for the damn thing instead of just having it sit there? It took 20 minutes for me to get my order.\n\nThe lady (sorry), which looked and sound like a man had some major attitude.  No smile what so ever.  We're from LA and we always order a ton of poke to bring back home.  We ordered a ton of Poke to bring back home and felt robbed. \n\n\nI found it \"fishy\" after tasting the quality of the poke and also the amount of time it took to get our order, that this was no longer Poke Express.  I had to yelp to find out they had moved.  Eventually went to the new location in which they had advise us Island Sushi took down their sign that they moved.  Basically taking over their business making it seem like it was still Poke Express without anyone knowing.  Shameful.\n\nPlease be aware and stay away!!!"

My group waited 10 minutes to get seated when there empty tables available and the three servers walking around got the orders from everyone around us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to order anything.  When they finally did, it took them near 20 minutes to get our first sushi orders to us.  I'm no sushi chef and I understand the restaurant gets a bit busy, but when all three servers are busy chatting away with everyone else and forgets to bring you the order you've been waiting for, 20 minutes is quite a long time to be waiting for a few sushi rolls.  Plus, the sushi rolls weren't even cut correctly and fell apart in a mess when we tried to eat the sushi.  After the first round of sushi, they asked once if we needed more sushi (and we said yes due to the pending 8 more sushi we ordered) and despite our long list of ordered sushi, it took about 30 minutes for one of the servers to come by and take our order again.  By this time I had lost my appetite and decided to pay the bill before I became even more pissed off due to their incompetence.  I'm from Hawai'i and when I saw 'Island Sushi' decided to stop in and check this place out, I really thought I would get that local island hospitality.  The only hospitality I got was \"Oh, sorry ah\" when they realized they forgot our table orders half and hour later.  Bad service and I definitely recommend this place if you're into spending your hard earned cash by sitting around and looking at other people eat."

They can't handle volume and they put customers down when they get busy because there is not enough staff to accommodate the customers. Only 2 sushi chefs and it sometimes takes over an hour to get food on the table. Employees look overworked and the service shows it. Sorry but this place sucks!"

We got seated after 5 minutes of standing there, to the right through the shower curtain doors there was a hole in the wall sit down area. The little plates that they put on the table are cute but the little bowl for the soy sauce isn't even big enough to dip a piece of sushi.  Then when you finally figure it out the soy sauce didn't even taste like soy sauce. So I asked for kikkoman soy sauce and three different waitresses passed us by never bringing the kikkoman. We had to ask 3 different waitresses to finally get the soy sauce. So I sat and watched our waitress flirt and laugh with the other table as I was patiently waiting to get some soy sauce to eat my sushi. Wow. To top it off she left a table of 5 people (us) with a tiny dish of ginger and wasabi.... not nearly enough. When we were ready to leave we had to ask for our check and Togo box and wait... All the while another waitress acknowledges us and tells us that if we want to take our 8 pieces of sushi that we had left she was going to charge us full price (we came during happy hour). Wow. Never again, I'll take my business elsewhere, thanks but no thanks.... it didn't even taste all that great. I would rather drive 10 minutes to Samurai sushi, for half price all day long, then ever step foot in that hell hole again."

They are so welcoming it feels like i'm home! Garlic chicken is so awesome. I always get the bento with the teriyaki beef and choice of chicken which would always be the garlic chicken. I share with my son all the time and he absolutely loves it. He never leaves me any noodles though :(  Now that they have poke express, I'm totally in love! Spicy ago combo is my ultimate fave poke! Their limu is good too. I'm just sad it's far from my house. Malasadas are yummy with the fillings. There are other desserts too. So good! A good 15 mins but it's so worth going there.\n\n*sushi side* All you can eat is great, i always have the scallop mayo, i can't find it anywhere else and that really reminds me of back home. they also have really good sides!  service is always good"

For $20.99 for lunch, you can eat unlimited appetizers, unlimited sushi rolls and nigiri, and one dessert.\n\nWe came here STARVING. It was around 2pm, and we had just come back from swimming in the nice pool garden at the Venetian. So believe me when I say that we were incredibly hungry. The server took our order for appetizers, and we got miso soup, edamame, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura, and maybe a few other things I don't remember. The shrimp tempura is only two pieces per order, so order several if you actually want to eat a decent amount. And who cares, it's unlimited anyway.\n\nNotable rolls: Black Widow and the Mauna Loa. Although to be honest, we tried everything that had soft shell crab in it and that was amazing too. We must have put through a gajillion orders of rolls and they got vanquished within two minutes of being placed on the table. The nigiri came last, and avoid the squid because it's super rubbery. The salmon was decent, and that's pretty much all I tried because I was saving room for dessert.\n\nI have made quite the convenient pairing, because the boyfriend doesn't like dessert and doesn't believe in always having room for it. I, meanwhile, had room for two desserts (I learned my lesson after the Mirage incident, see previous review). So I took my tempura ice cream (with vanilla ice cream, it was delicious) and then I took his green tea ice cream, which was a great way to round out the meal. After that, boy, was I full.\n\nI would come here again in a heartbeat. The fish is great, the sweet sauce they use to cover it is not too overbearing, and for all you can eat, this can't be beat. I would take a taxi from the strip and endure the $$$$ cab ride just to eat here again."

It can get pretty packed around dinner time and on weekends, but the wait is never long. \nSurf & Turf and Big Island are some of our favorite rolls, but the entire menu from miso soup to nigiri is delish. Finish dinner with hot fresh malassada and you're set! \nThis place never disappoints!"

The grocery store sushi has more flavor than this place! I'm so confused at what I just paid for. Oh, I know: Rice and Sysco MAYONNAISE. There was ZERO flavor here, and frankly, the temperature of the fish was disconcerting. Don't waste your money or risk your health. \n\n\n\nIn response to Terrance: You seem confused. Did you read my review?? I said your sushi was *COVERED* in mayonnaise and sauces. How is that protecting the \"integrity\" of your fish? I couldn't even taste the fish! All I could taste was that it was cheap quality and warm. Yuck. Go to Sushi Mon and see what a real, quality standard sushi place looks and tastes like."

I'm always up for giving anyone a second and maybe a third chance so this is my third chance in 11 months. Last time the food was pretty bad the sushi was really bad unfortunately it hasn't improved I think it's gotten worse.  The sushi is really terrible $21 lunch for all you can eat the miso soup is out of the machine or freeze dried a lot of the fish is obviously frozen. The shrimp tempura was greasy. The appetizer was frozen gyoza. The garlic chicken was burnt and greasy like you don't change the oil kind of greasy. I haven't had the take out part but the sit down food is  bad. How anybody gives this place more than two stars must have a low expectation of getting good food for their money.  I try to be fair but damn get your act together."

Poke express is inside island sushi and I was strictly coming here for poke but decided to eat at island sushi also. This place is pretty good. Good customer service and good food. The lady that had helped me was nice. She explained all the questions I had and was very nice about it. I liked the Hawaiian food mix that they had going on. \n\nI had the \"grilled\" side of island sushi.  I ordered the loco moco with Portuguese sausage. It was pretty good. I had tried stuff my group had gotten also. No complaints really.  I would recommend coming here just for the poke express but this place is a added bonus. Although it only says ISLAND SUSHI outside and a small poke express on the door when coming in. My food at poke express probably overshadowed how good the food is here so I will probably come back here and give an update if this place is even more awesome or not."

Literally everyone here is friendly, there aren't a bunch of places I can take my grandmother to, due to rude service or patrons, but this is always the go-to spot for us. I'm from hawaii so everything here is up my alley and I've been here so much I've practically had the entire menu, it's a great place to come, it can be busy if you come at lunch or their rush times. The sushi side is great too I've done that a couple times.\n\nI always order Poke here, I've tried it literally anywhere I could in Vegas, this is the only place I recommend to get it. Even though it's frozen, they prepare it in a way that I can't taste that, everywhere else the texture is mush. Here the fish is always firm as if it just came off the boat I really appreciate that as I can't find it anywhere else for a decent price.\n\nGreat place to come. Great place for food. Five stars from me, keep up the great work!"

Upon entering this establishment, I was a bit confused because there was a hawaiian restaurant in front of me and then a divider on the right which seemed like a sit down sushi restaurant. I guess it was two restaurants in one establishment. Anyways, I came for the loco moco. I ended up ordering the pulled pork loco moco and the chicken katsu. The lady who took our order in the front counter seemed overwhelmed as she was taking customer orders as well as phone orders. It didn't bother me so much that she was working hard, but it's nice to be in the moment with someone you're talking to.\n\nWhen the food arrived, oh boy did it look good. All in all, it was okay. It didn't really hit the spot as my go-to hawaiian restaurant in LA. It was filling no doubt, but it felt a little bland. It definitely needed salt. The egg on the loco moco was overcooked. I never had pulled pork in my loco moco and I thought it was an interesting meat to add on, but I think the gravy needed to be more flavorful for me to really enjoy the meal. \n\nThe Hawaiian side of this restaurant is small with long table seating and maybe 3-4 booths. There are TVs to keep you company while you wait for your food. In all, this place is alright, but I know there are other Hawaiian restaurants in the area that I might want to visit prior to returning here."

And usually when you get all you can eat they give you a piece of mochi cut in half or a sad excuse of a scoop of ice cream but the 808 special was a satisfying scoop of ice cream, tempura bananas, fresh strawberries, heap of whipped cream, and chocolate drizzle and it was perfection. The perfect end to a perfect dinner. with my drink my total was $28 which is completely reasonable. PS, when you buy 2 AYCE you get free sake. I don't know if it was everyday but it was nice."

What did separate Island from the game was their Sunday Special AYCE \"Pupus\", which I am guessing the Hawaiian version of a tapa.  From French Toast Malasadas to Mahi Mahi Sliders with Wasabi Aioli, the Pupus is what made my 20 bucks worth spending.  If I ever make second rounds, it'll only be for the Mini Peanut Butter Malasadas.  Other than that, I'll probably only come back when I'm in the mood for french toast and raw fish."

We ordered: pork loco, eggplant and chicken, cheeseburger combo and 1/2 lb poke. Pork loco so dry the meat and so little bit, chicken eggplant was all fatty pieces and swimming in oil (this was so junk) and damn we paid $1.25 extra just for brown rice! Most places are free or maybe .50 charge....this seems so excessive! Everything else was ok....we used to rate this place pretty good but just seems with the service and prep that they don't really care anymore. I dunno I don't think we will be back anytime soon.  Island Flavors is closer to is and their poke is way better and no extra charge for brown rice."

Only when my husband went to pick up the order, did they start cooking the order. Yes, I realize this makes absolutely no sense. Why would someone call in an order if the restaurant only started cooking the order once you've arrived and paid? Why waste your time even calling ahead?\n\nI left my phone number so they could've called me to ask for a credit card, if one was needed.

The pork gravy was yummy but it didn't reach its full potential until it was reheated at home. The katsu was OK. It had more breading than chicken. My friends ordered a beef with sauce which they said was very good. I will try that next time. The food overall is just not comparable to some restaurants in Hawaii but it will do!\n\nStaff: these ladies seemed extremely busy and didn't really smile much. I understand that they have things to do but it felt like I was a bother any time I needed something.\n\nThey upcharge 89 cents for teriyaki sauce. They only have soy sauce and ketchup on their condiment bar.\n\nTable and chair seating for maybe 6 people per row. They have a bout 4 rows.\n\nOverall, its a nice casual spot to get your Hawaiian fix but it doesn't necessarily trigger nostalgia that will transport you to hawaii --- the POKE side is great though"

Don't stay for more than 2 hours. One dessert per person.\n\nThe food: bomb. Quick. Not overly large rolls. The sushi chefs were nice and helpful. The specialty rolls were creative. Some new pairings I haven't seen before. The nigiri wasn't stingy on the fish. We had hamachi and salmon. Both were tender, fresh, and meaty.\n\nOne thing that was awesome about this place is that after 4 full rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri, the people were shocked we were ordering dessert. They wanted us to eat more. That says something about the service. They weren't trying to get us the fock out. \n\nAll in all, good place.

I Love Sushi (also on Eastern) is our usual go to but I suggested to be adventurous and try somewhere new!\n\nWhen you first walk in I believe you're in Poke Express, a separate quick service restaurant inside Island Sushi. There is a place to order to the left and casual seating straight ahead. To the right is an entrance that opens up to Island Sushi which is a pretty small restaurant. We waited to be seated and the host said it would be about 30 min for a table. We decided to get started on sake at the bar and was seated at a table shortly after. \n\nWe weren't starving so we ordered a la carte rather than AYCE. I had the spicy garlic edamame, tuna poke, and a spicy tuna hand roll. The tuna wasn't very fresh in either of my tuna entrees. Hand roll was pretty tasteless, so I doused it in soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna poke was highly disappointing!! It wasn't flavorful and the texture of the tuna honestly felt like it sat out for a few hours. Some pieces were dry and chewier than the norm. The tuna was on a bed of seaweed salad, which was also dry. SO dry that when I tried to gather some seaweed salad with my chopsticks, I picked up ALL of the seaweed salad in an large chunk instead. \n\nThe spicy garlic edamame wasn't bad, but didn't taste extraordinary enough to make me want to come back to this place...\n\nNo complaints with the service, however, the dishes I tried here weren't memorable or enjoyable. Doubtful I'll return."

He swore that he had done his best to oversell the place not just to us, but to many other people, and that nobody had ever been disappointed. Well...he was right. This place is amazing!\n\nNormally, all you can eat sushi is more a matter of finding a place with decent sushi rather than anything great. But Island Sushi is simply fantastic. From the service to the food, I can't believe how good it was!\n\nI'll admit, pulling up to this place, I was somewhat skeptical. It was pretty dark from the outside and didn't even really appear to be open. Even after coming inside, the initial welcome room was dark and pretty void of people. But once we got into the main eating area, it was on!\n\nI knew that we were in for a treat when the sashimi salad and poke bowl came out. I could have eaten nothing but those two and been extremely happy. But my friend was ordering all of his favorites, and we ate all of them happily. The nigiri was perfect--a better ratio of fish to rice than most places. The cooked dishes we had, including soft-shelled crab, tempura shrimp, and beef of a couple of different varieties (one of which was right at the top of the best dishes there) were all perfectly cooked. I probably could have made a meal out of any individual dish I was served, so to have so many different delicious items made for a great experience. Dessert was pretty decent, too. You get your choice of 2 desserts (because you need 2 desserts after all you can eat sushi!), and they're all pretty interesting. There were 2 dishes involving bananas; any place that offers banana desserts gets points in my book.\n\nThe service was fantastic. I'm used to waiting long periods of time at any sushi restaurant, much less an all you can eat sushi restaurant, for each round of orders. But Island Sushi was bringing out dishes left and right, as they were prepared. We had a constant stream of food and were never left waiting. Excellent, friendly service!\n\nAnd price-wise, this place is great. It's only around $25 for all you can eat (although they do limit the quantity of certain dishes that you can order).\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely coming back to Island Sushi!"

Adds a yummy crunch to the block of delicious goodness that is spam, rice and sauce.  \n-  Goteburg musubi - The portuguese sausage also with rice. Yum!\n-  Malasadas - like a creme filled donut.  \n\nIve recently also had them cater my sister's bachelorette party which was held at the Vdara.  Their catering menu is available online.  I ordered a small tray (feeds about 10-15 people) each of the:   \n-  kalbi ($70):  good quality beef perfectly grilled. No sogginess or rubberiness.\n-  chicken katsu ($36):  Still even crunchy after it was delivered. \n-  garlic chicken ($36) :  So simple yet so flavorful\n-  mac salad ($24) and rice ($17): must haves when ordering Hawaiian food.\n\nI also ordered 6 pounds of the amazing poke.  My order was delivered to the hotel at the time I had requested and without any issues.  I received a call when they were on their way and when the food arrived at the hotel.  The poke was delivered on ice.\n\nEverything was delicious - as expected - and a big hit with the ladies.  I was a bit nervous that it would be too much food for 14 girls, but the small trays turned out to be the perfect amount.  We had enough for dinner, for a late night meal after hitting the club, and even for breakfast!  \n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend Island Sushi for a nice meal and/or for catered events."

Island Sushi was nearby so we stopped. SO glad we did. I had never been here for AYCE Sunday brunch and it was to die for. In addition to AYCE sushi covering most of the menu (including apps and cooked food), they also had a huge list of additional offerings including breakfast mains, Hawaiian favorites, special sushi rolls and desserts - all part of the AYCE menu. Banana bread french toast with coconut syrup? Yes, please. Spam omlette? Yes, please. Malasadas with guava syrup? Yes!\n\nI am a very picky sushi eater, but every time I have been to Island Sushi the fish has been very fresh. I also appreciate they dont give you these huge clumps of sushi rice with AYCE in a cheap attempt to fill you up. The staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is relaxed. Overall, for the money, quality and service I dont think you can beat Island Sushi for sushi. Make sure you go for Sunday brunch!"

I recommend their garlic chicken on this side of town, poke avocado bowl, pau hana roll, kahuku roll, negihama roll, and big island roll. I have never had bad sushi here...ever! It gets even better, they have dessert! Yummy malasadas with various fillings, whole and individual cake slices (guava, haupia, dobash, and chantilly). Also, seasonal offerings such as pumpkin mochi!

The only time I go there is during happy hour when stuff is 50% off. If you want great sushi go to Yama Sushi.\n\nAs for the grill side, the food is horrible. I had the Kalbi ribs and the teriyaki chicken. The Kalbi ribs tasted like old meat... it was gross. The teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki flavor whatsoever and it did not even come with teriyaki sauce. Also, the macaroni salad was the worst Hawaiian mac salad I have ever tasted. It was extremely bland. The food was so horrible it seemed as if it was prepared this way on purpose to keep people away. I just don't see how they could make the food so bad!\n\nIf you want good Hawaiian food go to Aloha Kitchen.

I've never eatten at the Sushi restaurant, only at the Hawaiian food and Poke Express.\n\nThe Poke is really awesome.  If you like Tagu, it is sweet and chewy and very authentic.  The shou Poke and spicy poke is great also.  If you are a poke fan, do try Poke Express.\n\nI usually get the Bento Box A with Garlic Chicken.  It is a huge meal with rice, Teri beef, garlic chicken, spam and noodles.  Very flavorful and filling.  My wife gets the tuna bowl.  That is huge also.  Great flavors with the tuna and rice.\n\nThey have Oxtail soup on Saturdays all day and after 600pm other days.  I like this and it's very authentic.  You combine the rice and ginger and green onions and you have a cornucopia of flavors and textures in that oxtail soup.  It has been the best I could find so far in Las Vegas.\n\nI would pass on the Saiman.  The noodles are good, but the broth is not as flavorful as the other places I've tried in LV.  \n\nOverall, the go-to spot for Hawaiian food this side of town."

It isn't too sticky or moist, it's just right.  Also, a keynote when ordering get the deep fried gesu.  OMG! It's amazing, especially with their mayo sauce.  It just makes everything taste better! I tend to think that the sashimi tastes better on sushi, so if you're craving raw fish.  Go for their sushi, it tastes a heck of a lot better. \n\nBeing from the Island, I say go here if you're craving the island food.

Yummy!\n- Garlic Chicken: flavor overload in my mouth! Couldn't get enough of this.\n- Ahi Poki: FRESH FRESH FRESH TUNA! It almost felt as if the fish were swimming in my mouth.\n- Tempura Philly Roll: Fried. Cream Cheese. Fresh Salmon. I can't ask for a better combination.\n\nAll their sushi is extremely fresh and they do sushi right. Make sure you order accordingly because they will charge your ass for leftovers. For dessert, make sure you get the \"808 Special\", tempura-battered bananas and strawberries topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dallop of whipped cream. *drools. \n\nWith a party of 14, the service was exceptional. Our waitress kept us happy with our Sake Bombs and kept up with our nonstop demands for food.\n\nThey, also, have a pretty decent \"Happy Hour\", which consists of $1.50 Small Beers and $3.00 Big Beers.

I'm glad I finally went as the food, service and vibe of the place is what I look for when I seek out local food in Vegas. It's a chill place with good food. That's what I seek.\n\nLocated along Eastern Ave near the 215 FWY and in the same plaza as Red Rice. Parking lot is shared with the other businesses so just avoid the 30 min only parking spots.\n\nThe mochiko chicken was tasty. It had a seasoned batter on it and I really liked that the chicken was still moist on the inside. The only thing I would change is maybe dip the chicken in some katsu or teriyaki sauce next time. Other than that, I really liked it. It came with about 5-6 pieces of chicken, 1 scoop of rice and a side of mac salad. I recommend it for sure. The spam musubi was good and tasty. Cant go wrong with a musubi... The lychee green tea is my favorite of all the Hawaiian Sun drinks. So good. It's like the best flavor, best water ever. \n\nService is friendly.

When we're in the area for lunch or if we aren't in the mood for cooking dinner and one of us is passing by after work we'll call in a Bento A and Bento C. We really like the garlic chicken. Unfortunately, we haven't tried anything else there because we like the Bento's so much. The price for the two bento's is reasonable to us.\nIt can get pretty busy around lunch time so it wouldn't hurt to call it in if you're in a rush."

Tight at the bar though. Parking is plenty. Located in a plaza off of Eastern, it is semi busy in the area. Brings in good traffic. The inside of the restaurant is a bit cramed away from the bar. I believe about 9 tables total. Yes pretty small. Because of the small space, it gets pretty loud with a full house. Both times we were there it took about 5-10 minutes for us to get greeted, which is very rare. Customer service is good. Enough to where the Mrs. did not complain.\n\n\nWhat ordered:\n\nAlbacore\nHamachi\nSake\nSuper white\nSweet shrimp\nGreen mussels\nSeaweed salad\nMiso soup\nSashimi salad\nRaw crab poke\nAhi poke\nSoftshell crab\nFried tamper\nHamachi kama\nEggplant fries\n\n\nPauhana roll\n\nMalassada sundae\nGreen tea ic\n\nMore rice than fish. Nothing stuck out enough to write about, which makes this my most simple review yet. It's a good spot to go if your in the area and need a \"Smith's\" style sushi fix."

So she decided to have her bachelorette in none-other, VEGAS!!!   Our first meal there was at Island Sushi. It was an L&L look alike.  Why we came here, I have no idea.  I can get this at home, really.  The food was not noteworthy.  However, what was disturbing was inside the restaurant.  The place looked so drabbed down I wouldn't want to be found dead here.  The question remains as to whether or not I would come back here again. The answer is probably no because I don't prefer plate lunches.\n\nEnvironment: When you come here, it resembles so much like Hawai'i.  Didn't you know Las Vegas is the new safe house for former Hawai'i residents, who can't afford to live there?  Once inside, it wasn't too appealing in color.  You see all the metallic refrigerators, kitchen area.  The floors are drab, the walls are dark tinted yellow.  It is certainly meant for a quick and run kind of sit-in place. \n\nFood: I had the Garlic Ahi and all brown rice.  It looked like 3 pieces of 3 oz of grilled ahi, once slice of lemon, and 2 cups of brown rice.  This will fill you up for the price.  The Garlic Ahi was a bit bland.  I would recommend having a garlic sauce to go with it to make it jump from mediocre to awesome. I should have opted out for the mini plate on this one, but because I was starving I didn't care. 3/5\n\nPoke: Although, I didn't have this, the fish didn't look fresh.  It didn't have that shiny, unslimmy, I-Was-Just-Placed-Here kind of look to it.  Yikes! Joe and Phil decided to get it anyway.  Luckily, they chose something that was a little fresher, but the taste was not Hawai'I or my father's level of greatness. 2/5\n\nCost: My plate came out to be 9.95.  That's cheap, considering the brown rice was an extra $1.25.  Ridiculous.  However, what was uber expensive was the poke. $16.99 a pound!  Jesus Christ!  And if you read the latter information, you would know you were being gypped. \n\nEmployees: They were very nice.  The girl at the desk greeted with a smile.  Very courteous, it almost made me forget that the place was a POS.\n\nParking: This was by far the best feature of this place.  Because it's Vegas, meaning more land space, we had prime real estate, also known as right in front of the doors."

            "review": "Went here for a family dinner and got the AYCE for around $27 per person. This is probably the first resto with 3 different spots: plate lunches, poke, and sushi (a sushi resto to be exact). Think L & L , Tanioka's, and Sushi Twister all combined into one. Was the AYCE worth it? I think so. You can order anything on the menu with a limit of 2 for desserts. The poke was great and had that melt in your mouth texture. My dad ordered around 3-4 small bowls of poke alone. The sushi was pretty good but I think still not as good as Yama Sushi. The only thing that I would say negative about this place is that the male waiters in the sushi resto were not really \"waiters.\" They were pretty much  there to take your order and give you your food. I would expect a waiter or waitress to be at least a little engaging and I don't think once did the guy ask \"How was the food?\". But the food is good and I'll come back to try their plate lunches.\n\nNote: You know when you are next to Hawaiian locals when you hear the table across from you say, \"Uncle, sooooo....how was California Hotel?\" LOL"

The sushi rolls were unrolling and the amount of time for service has taken a long time even when Island isn't packed. I know that ownership has changed and this may be why the whole experience has a cheapened feel to it. I may give it one last chance in the future but if it's the same as it has been then that's that. In the meantime I will be looking for another sushi restaurant with a regular menu and an all you can eat."

Of course we directed our interest to what Yelp had to say.  20.95 for all you can eat sushi PLUS side dishes PLUS Sunday specials!  What a steal!  \n\nI was really impressed with the flavors of the sushi and the taste of the food served here.  Of the three other \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi restaurants in Henderson, I have discovered Island Sushi to top it all!  You won't be disappointed!  \n\nOne thing that I really enjoyed was that they do not flood each roll of sushi with white rice!  You get a significant amount of \"filling\" and \"topping\" on each of the rolls you order!  They aren't being cheap at all!  \n\nAlso to all those locals from Hawaii out there, they have Poke here!  And it's GOOD!  They also have a extensive plate lunch menu and they serve saimin and bentos!  \n\nOne suggestion to the fellow yelpers is to come on Sunday!  Those Sunday specials are a steal and are very delicious, particularly the Ahi Belly!  \n\nThe only downside to this place and for me giving Island Sushi only 4 stars is that you are only limited to one dessert. Cmon!  Dessert is like the best part of a meal!! =P  Hopefully that rule changes!  \n\nEven so, I'd definitely be back to try this place!"

Island Sushi and Grill is also right next to Poke Express, so that's convenient if you want to take some to-go.

My favorite part about this ayce is their appetizers.

Especially liked Mickey's rice, a genuine Da Kine comfort food. AYCE prices for dinner are pretty competitive. Will try again. Service could be just a little more responsive. Not really too bad, but the wait staff could be a little more tuned in the customers' needs. Only thing that kept me from grading 4 stars. So 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating. \n\nThere are two parts to Island Sushi. One side of the business is a sit down sushi and grill joint with well spaced tables and a sushi bar. The other side is primarily a take out \"Poke Express\" that serves up different varieties of poke and other goodies, think Island Style small plates. We only tried the lunch time a la carte sushi side. Definitely will try the Island Style take out on a different occasion. If we can find some taro chips to go with the poke, it will be like the Princeville grocery on the north coast of Kauai. Looking forward to checking out Poke Express. \n\nOne tip if you plan to go. Parking is not good. Island Sushi is in an Eastern Ave strip mall with inadequate parking. Quite a few of the spaces are marked \"30 mins only\" and \"15 mins only\". We just had to ignore that and parked in a 30 minute spot. Another parking anomaly is that the handicapped parking was at the back of the parking lot. Never saw that before. Regardless, solving the parking dilemma is worth the trip."

When one of our friends that lives in Vegas brought us here we were  a bit hesitant about this place.  We walked in and I swear it felt like I just walked into a cafe from Hawaii.  The smell of the malasadas were awesome.  I love how there's a bakery on one side and the restaurant on the other.  So we sat down, a party of 14, and  all ordered AYCE... The faces on the sushi chefs were classic. Hahaha We ordered pretty much every roll they had and every single one was bomb.  I cant remember the names but damn they were good.  The one that got me was the Uni and kimchee fried rice.  Damn that uni was damn good.  I could eat tons of that kimchee fried rice.  So we came to the desert and first thing i see is the malasada ice cream sundae.  WHAT! oh hell yes I will take one pls.  Their malasada was so good we ordered 2 dozen before we left. Hahahaha not as good as Leonards in Hawaii but pretty damn close. The service was the best as close as you can get to the aloha spirit of Hawaii.  Some even still have their pidgin accent. Awesome.   I will definitely be coming here again.. Great place!!!"

It was confusing because we stood there...a family of 6 just standing there for a few minutes that felt like 15minutes. We were completely ignored as if the workers were deliberately not looking up just so that they don't have to acknowledge us. After a few minutes of awkward standing...my husband walks up to the guy by the register to ask what the deal is. Then he readily explains to my husband how it works. First off, it would have been nice to have been acknowledged. I understand things get busy but I come from a background of customer service that no matter how busy you are...you should keep a constant habit of looking up at your surroundings. I almost walked out, but hell...we drove from the North side, traffic and all, just to eat dinner there for my son's birthday...I was going to stick it out.\n\nSo, apparently the please wait to be seated sign along with the put your name down is for their sushi side. When we wrote our names down it was like magic. Someone came and sat us down. We opted to eat at the sushi side because we were planning on some sushi anyways. I honestly don't know if on the grill side you have to wait to be seated. I'm assuming you'd just order then sit at whatever tables are available.\n\nOnce seated, the servers were completely friendly and homely feeling. However, I couldn't shake off this weird vibe I was getting in there. Don't know if it was the aftershock from standing around waiting part, but whatever, and so we ordered.\n\nKids collectively ordered the classic Loco moco, mini chicken katsu, and side order of fries. I decided for just the spam saimin, while the husband ordered spicy tuna, spicy hamachi, and the spicy salmon roll. M-W is all day happy hour. 50% off their sushi rolls with the exception of their nigiris and hand rolls. That is an awesome deal! Such deal made their sushi taste even better. The husband enjoyed his. Typical.\n\nMy saimin was pretty much....saimin. There was nothing extra special or memorable. But, I wasn't expecting anything magical considering it's simply a spam saimin. I did wish my saimin was a little less mushy. It did the job on my saimin crave, though. \n\nI can't tell you what the katsu tasted like but the husband said twas legit. My oldest kanacked off his Loco moco. He opted for all rice and boy was that plate serious. Couldn't tell you what that tasted like, but it looked homely put together. \n\nThe fries tasted like the frozen seasoned french fries you can buy yourself. I don't mind that taste so no biggy. It was nice and crispy and that's all the mattered.\n\nOverall, we spent about 34bucks. The server that took care of us was right-on with it. It made up for what had lacked. Once you figure out what happens when you enter...you'll pretty much be taken care of. I did notice it was a man's world that evening. Male chefs, cooks, servers...thought that was kinda cool because that's not something I aways come across. Plus, they all seemed super nice.\n\nI'd return for sure especially for their sushi happy hour if we are in the area or feel like going on a drive. I think it's great that our family has options. The kids can get their 808 fix while the hubs and I can get our sushi on. Overall, I can only give 3 stars because it honestly was just mediocre to me. Maybe in the future I can up a star.\n\nDefinitely kid friendly. Highchairs with working buckles, yay! But leave your stroller in the trunk especially if it's busy. For a Monday night...they were poppin'."

We called asking if their poke station was still open around 7:45pm just to be sure our long drive was worth it. So we decided to order something from their grill section as well and also asked if we could go ahead and place an order for the poke but was told it had to be done in person which is understandable. May I also point out that the lady on the phone did not sound happy at all to talk over the phone. So we arrive there around 8:20 just to have them tell us their poke station is closed because they ran out of fish. Fish! What a horrible excuse. How can they operate their sushi section of the place if there's no fish. Since this is the only poke place that is even remotely close to us we now know better to order poke in the day because obviously they'll \"run out of fish\"."

Well, the servers began coming by and taking plates off our table that had sushi on it. Our friend who had a couple pieces left on his plate told the server he wasn't done and she put another plate over it and squished his food.

We had a party of 10, but our server, who was one of the best I've ever had, gave us his complete attention and smilies. Our kids weren't the most quietest however the help from the other servers to assist and keep us off of the pressure was none short of awesome. I only wish they were bigger! The great aloha spirit was definitely felt here and I will definitely be back and recommend to everybody. Thanks Island Sushi!"

I went here often when I lived in Vegas, and I always try to come back when I visit. The fish is fresh and delicious, comparable to sushi I eat when visiting Cali. \n\nService is always prompt, and the AYCE menu is very comprehensive. I love that appetizers are included. The rolls are creative without being unappetizing, which unfortunately happens at a lot of \"creative\" sushi joints.\n\nI always recommend sitting at the bar, and try to sit in front of Chuy if you can. All the chefs are great, but he is so sociable and nice! I don't think he remembers me from when I used to come here, but he acts like he does. And, that's more than I could ever ask for. Super nice dude.\n\nWhat makes this place stand out from the rest is that there is a separate side of the restaurant devoted to Hawaiian/Pacific Islander type foods, like butter mochi. You can also buy poke, there!\n\nIn short, just go eat there. It's awesome and affordable."

I must say we were thoroughly impressed! I'm not a sushi connoisseur by all means but I have had my share of sushi from all around the world within 39 years of my life and this place generated a big smile on my face when I left. Most AYCE sushi joints around Vegas can't compare to the quality and price of this place. The items you can order with the AYCE deal is extraordinary...especially when you can order kal bi and poke. To top it off, my 11 year old daughter and wife were so happy to be here and loved every bite. And finally, I want to say thank you for supporting the military and offering a military discount to our meal!!! There are few minor flaws about this place. 1. I wish the bathrooms were bigger. 2. I wish you guys would turn up the Hawaiian/Island music more. I couldn't hardly hear what was playing. 3. I wish you guys would open up another restaurant in the Centennial Hills area, or somewhere close to there. Thank you Island Sushi team for the superb experience. We'll be visiting again if we're ever on that side of town."

To-go orders have always been ready when they said they would be, packaged up properly and handed over by a smiling employee. \n\nOn my most recent visit I took 3 out of towners:\nMy brother-in-law and his wife aren't big on sushi so they got items from the grill side of the menu while a friend and I both did ACYE. Pricing for AYCE is in line with most spots in town. There are some limitations on the menu (the standards: certain items can only be ordered at dinner, some are limited to one per person, no sharing). All of the sushi we ordered was excellent, nigiri was cut well and had a good fish to rice ratio. My in-laws were pleased with their selections, and we all left happy and very full for a great price.\n\nOn Sundays, Island Sushi & Grill does an AYCE brunch that I am looking forward to trying soon.

The great thing about this place (to me) is that it's away from the LV Strip.  Been there, done that, y'know? Sometimes off the beaten track is best and Island Sushi did not disappoint!\n\nThis place is a hole-in-the-wall. No doubt about that.  You want a Zen or tranquil or a sleek sushi house experience, this ain't it.  This is get-down-to-business-eat-your-sushi-or-Hawaiian-favorites kinda joint. \n\nWe had a fantastic experience.  The servers were great. Always checking on us, clearing plates, refilling glasses and making sure if we wanted more sushi--and not in a \"hurry up and order\" kind of way, but in a genuine \"would you like more to eat?\" kind of way.  \n\nThis was my first time doing AYCE sushi (other than Todai which I hated, so I won't count that).  We made sure we understood the rules and then we ordered well.  Very well.  Everything was delicious. Well made and fresh. \n\nWe ordered Ahi Poke and Hammachi Kama.  The Ahi Poke was my favorite--the flavors so fresh. I wish I could re-create it at home because I'd eat it at least once a week. The Hammachi was delicious too. It reminded me of the grilled fish my dad serves.\n\nNigiri: Tuna, Cajun Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Super White Tuna, Albacore, Hammachi, Salmon, Ebi and Unagi.  Some we loved so much we ordered them twice (and 3 times in the case of Garlic Tuna)  \n\nMaki: Tiger, Spicy Mexican, Joe's Special.  All so good. If you like Jalapeno and Siracha, the Mexican roll is for you.  For me, it had a nice heat, not too spicy.  The Tiger Roll was my favorite because I love shrimp tempura and spicy tuna--well made and tasty. Joe's Special--I don't know who Joe is, but this is also a fine roll--shrimp tempura, cucumber and ahi. \n\nSave room for dessert.  In fact, if you're full, order dessert anyway.  They're not huge portions but are certainly delicious.  I had the Malassada sundae, made with warm malassada donuts, vanilla ice cream, strawberries and guava sauce drizzle. Every bite was delicious.  I also got to try the warm brownie sundae--also very good. The brownie is dense and rich, almost like a flourless chocolate cake. \n\nThe bro is good at math so I had him check our AYCE price versus if we just paid a la carte--the AYCE is definitely a steal.  This is certainly better than any buffet style AYCE sushi because you can order off of 3 different pages of Nigiri and Maki and side dishes and everything is fresh to order."

At first it sounds too good to be true, followed by a sneaking suspicition of poor quality and limited selection.\n\nNot at Island Sushi! For $20.99 at lunch ($24.95 for dinner), you get a large selection of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, and even desserts.  I mostly avoided the apps (ordered a miso soup and edamame), and stuck with the nigiri.  The fish was fresh and tasty, and the quality was just as good for the most part of some of the fancier sushi joints I have tried around the country.  If you come hungry, you definitely get you money's worth without sacrificing quality.\n\nThe atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, as its in a strip mall and seating area is just cheap tables and chairs.  If you want a fancy dining experience, this is not the place.  I was by myself for lunch and the sushi bar has a small flatscreen TV to watch while I stuffed myself.  They also do quite a few happy hour type specials on rolls and sake bombs throughout the week if you aren't in the AYCE mood.  For your non-raw fish eating friends, the other half of the restrauant has a pretty extensive cooked Hawaiian menu.  However, I don't forsee myself trying that anytime soon.  The sushi deal here is just too good!  Just remember to save some room for that 808 Special dessert!"

I come most often with my work colleagues during lunch and they consistently get us in and out for a power AYCE lunch in less than an hour during the busiest times. The efficiency at lunch, the poke, and the desserts separate Island from some of the other AYCE sushi places.\n\nI came for Tuesday lunch with my wife on my most recent visit and we had a very enjoyable meal. A California roll is the closest thing to sushi my wife will eat, but she still has plenty to choose from. The teishoku combination B is plenty of food for $14 (see picture). For AYCE, the ahi poke is a must. When I'm with my buddies, they order more rolls which are pretty standard at lunch, but I stick with nigiri. I'm not a sauce person for much of anything, and while the sake with orgasm sauce isn't quite orgasmic, it's a sauce that's creamy with some tart that I'll definitely make an exception for. The garlic tuna is another nigiri that we all like that is better than most places. I do like the white fishes like red snapper and halibut, but unfortunately, they don't carry these.\n\nMake sure you save room for dessert too. I'll usually get the \"808\" Special and green tea ice cream. The tempura ice cream is solid, the creme brulee is a favorite of my daughter, and the malassada sundae is a dessert that is unique to Island.\n\nLunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. They have discounted rolls and drinks during happy hour along with AYCD house sake for AYCE patrons. Service is mostly friendly and accommodating, as it was on our last visit. We've had occasional visits where service has been slow and I think that is completely dependent on who is serving you and if they are on island time or not.\n\nThe dining room is small and the sushi bar has about 5 or 6 seats so expect a wait during the peak times for dinner. A crowded lot with no spots will be the best indication of their volume. The longest we've waited was 30 minutes on a Friday night after we signed our name on the list. The advantage of coming in for dinner is that you get to have many of the items that are not available at lunch such as the raw crab poke, raw tako wasabi, and the kalbi ribs.\n\nIsland Sushi has been consistent for me for years and here's to many more."

One thing that stands out here is that the people that serve you here are really nice and they want their customers to try everything.normally when you go to an AYCE place they rush you and after about three orders they tend to forget about you because they don't want you to order anymore..lol I know maybe I'm paranoid or I eat alot of sushi. Oh the tempura ice cream is awesome and the island special roll is great.my wife loves that they have hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) which is bomb too."

(I was the only newbie).\n\nWHERE: Located on Eastern & Serene.\n\nWHAT: As a first-timer, I had to do AYCE!! Wouldn't it be a waste if I didn't eat all I could?!! Ok so back to my experience.  I am in love with baked rolls, and the only downside to this place was that AYCE did not have ANY baked rolls whatsoever! I was bummed at first, but when I tried what they did have, my \"bummness level\" decreased.\n\nWHAT I HAD:\n\nThe appetizers I had were: ahi poke (I might have to say that this is one of the best I've tasted in town! It was very fresh and tasty), mochiko chicken (ahh, I fell in love after the first bite!), seaweed salad (sweet & delishhhh), and baked mussels (always one of my favorites when on any menu).\n\nSpecial Sushi rolls I had:\n-Mt. Charleston roll; Since they didn't have baked rolls, they did have baked scallops on this roll.  I had to take advantage because this was the closest thing to baked that I'd be getting that night. Haha, when I did get my roll, I was very pleased!\n-Ahi Poke roll; I apparently couldn't get enough of the tuna in my system, I needed more! Kudos to this roll though =).\n-Island Special roll; this roll was my all time favorite! Everyone must have this! It hit the spot indeed.\n\n*NOTE: if you do decide to do AYCE, you get to choose a free dessert! I always have room for dessert in my tummy =D. There were malasada&icecream, brownie&icecream, just plain icecream, mochi, and I believe there were a couple more.  I settled for my mango mochi of course.\n\nWHY: A lot of people have been comparing Island Sushi to 808 Sushi (because of the whole owner/chef switch, I actually am not so clear of it myself), but I have personally come to conclude that Island Sushi defeats 808 Sushi in my book."

            "review": "This is probably my favorite place to eat in Vegas. I usually eat on the grill side of the restaurant, and I've only been on the sushi side once, so this review is mostly about the plates they have.  I usually get a 2-item combo which is a dollar more than highest priced item...  Usually it's garlic chicken and and the chicken or pork with eggplant.  The garlic chicken is just perfect.  It's fried, and I want to drink the garlicky soy sauce that it's smothered in.  The eggplant is also really good and they can make it spicy for you.  I'm usually pretty sensitive to spicy food, but the spicyness isn't overwhelming and provides a tiny kick to your muth.  Your plate is really full of the food you order with two scoops of rice and a mac salad.  I've also tried the kalua pig and mochicko chicken.  I'm not from Hawaii, so I don't know how the kalua pig compares, but it's alright...  The mochicko chicken is really similar to the garlic chicken, but it's good in its own way.  \nThere isn't much to say about the service since the grill side is more of a help yourself out, but the guys behind the register are all really cool, and if they were servers, I'm sure they'd be really good. \nAlso, the malasadas are great especially if they're fresh, and you can get them filled with custard, chocolate, or haupia cream.  They also have a ton of desserts displayed when you first walked in, and somehow I've managed to avoid them (usually because I'm too full to think of dessert when I'm done), but from the way they look, I'm sure they're great.\n\nAs for the sushi side, I've only gone once and didn't do the AYCE since back then they had a special for 50% off sushi on Mondays (I'm not sure if it's still there, but I doubt it).   It's been a while, but I think I really enjoyed the Hawaiian roll.  And the food and service on the sushi side is just as good as the grill side...  I can't wait to come back here and am always willing to drive across town to come here."

I'm always a bit leary because what a friend think's is good quality is completely different then what I think is good.  \n\nSo... I walk inside and it's divided into 2 types of restaurants in 1 bldg with a wall dividing the two.  Inside the main entrance is the hawaiian side of the dining room with approx 3 tables and a counter area to order from just like aloha kitchen and L&L hawaiian.  On the other side of the wall is the sushi side of the restaurant with several tables and a sushi bar (both halves of this place are VERY small)  So after waiting a few minutes I get a seat at the sushi bar and they have 2 chefs and I think 2 or 3 servers and the place is full.  It is VERY easy to see right away that they are definitely under staffed for the amount of guests they have. After waiting approx 15 min we finally get to place our first order.  The menu looks good and the quality was fine (nothing great but certainly nothing bad at all)  But they were definitely VERY slow both the food and the servers and very cramped inside.  Once thing I will mention is when I ordered the uni (sea urchin) the first piece tasted very funny and odd and I thought ok maybe just maybe it was me.. I tried the 2nd piece and it was very noticeable.  \n\nSorry, This place is definitely not worth going to. There are several places closer to me that I can get avg sushi and better service at."

I have to admit that the Nigiri was totally worth it.. fish to rice ratio was great.  Big pieces of fish with smaller amounts of rice made the hamachi nigiri a go-to favorite of the night.  Another must is the eggplant fries! My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, but he loved the garlic chicken and the eggplant fries. \n\nAnother aspect on their menu is the malasada sundae... and their desserts in general.

When you order from the servers the food comes out hot, or cold as the case may be, and quick- never had to remind a server \"we're waiting on,...\" ever.  The AYCE rules are reasonable, and, best of all, never get the feeling they're slowing down because you are doing AYCE -- Rolls are good, a good variety of everything- I developed a shrimp allergy, so even with that, the variety is outstanding, and they will make accommodations.  Not fancy, so don't get your hopes up that you're going to a place that's getting Michelin Stars- if you want a place that you can go, eat good food, relax and have a nice visit with friends and family, there ya go!"

But today my friend Lisa and I had the displeasure of being served by Mila and I have to say something about it. We were coming to get some sushi. Decided to do all you can eat and heard about all you can drink for $10. Awesome deal. We are both full time business women and wanted to unwind with a few beers and some good food. Mila explained that it's $10 all you can eat sake and beer. Cool. Then she later corrected that they are individual charges. We said fine, Lisa would get the beer and I'd get the sake. We could have it all! Mila corrected us, which was fine. That's her job. But being in the customer service industry, I welcome all feedback and use it as growth to improve every customers time in my store, and decided to tell Mila that I would appreciate if she could just give the feedback to the restaurant management that I feel it should be interchangeable. Just like getting all you can eat and sharing the rolls, getting all you can drink should follow the same structure. * if both parties are paying, then why not?* \n\nShe seemed to think my feedback was more funny than valuable, and proceeded to point at a table in the corner and say \"well they are all sitting over there, so-\" as if I wanted to stop my lunch to go relay the message. \n\nAll she would have have to do is say \"thank you for that feedback, I will make sure they hear it\". \n\nFrom then on I just began to lose my desire to be there. Listen, all you can drink is a great idea, in an atmosphere where you facilitate an environment where people feel valued and welcomed. Mila sadly had a poor attitude the rest of our visit and did very routine \"check ins\" but obviously was following a script vs. any kind of genuine interest in our satisfaction as customers. \n\nWe were the only ones there too, and Mila kept going to the other table (the table full of the owners and managers) it made us feel like we were being talked about and it created less of a welcoming atmosphere. Remember, perception is reality. So be aware of your customers. \n\nI'm so bummed about this experience. It was my friends first time here and I feel she had a very bad impression of what this restaurant stands for. Sure makes me think twice about coming here. The prices are the same anywhere, I come here equally because the food kicks ass, but mostly because of the environment and the amazing customer service.

I am definitely not fond of the digital photo frames up next to our table, showcasing various rolls,random groups of people, and, then, seeing it in a never ending loop from the corner of your eye! \n\nIn any case, you just might find me there eating a plate lunch on the grill side. ;)"

The food wasnt prepared right... some of the hot items were lukewarm instead.\n\nNigiri was falling apart so I went to Island Sushi after friend's suggestion.\n\nBeen there now the 5th time.  Same thing is happening.\n\nAt first, I love this place for its rolls.  It has all sorts of amazing sushi rolls... deep fried sushi with cream cheese, or Las Vegas rolls.  Its sashimi portion was generous while the rice was minimal.  No rice pushing.  \n\nThe AYCE menu is awesome with many choices... typically the one time order for Uni, Sweet Shrimp and you can always put the sweet shrimp into the soup.  In addition, you can also have the POKE dishes which are awesome, i love the many cool items such as fish head, shrimp tempura.\n\nOn this visit, the rice was increasing and sashimi didnt look fresh.  The items came but it wasnt as appetizing as before.  The Unagi was horribly made, it was just a clump of fish and rice and wasnt beautifully presented like before.\n\nAlot of rice in the hand rolls and overall food quality isnt as great.\n\nIm afraid to say, maybe it was an off day, but I did notice an overall decrease in quality.  Its still good, just not as good.  So I will give a 2 star!"

I love when we don't have to ask for our water refills. I ordered everything your only allowed to get once but it was sooooo good. Rolls and nigiri were awesome. Will definitely be back again."

We went as a group of 6.... all ordered AYCE.  We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second.  That's really unacceptable.\n\nAs far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi.  On a Friday night at 6:30?  That's crazy.  And that would probably explain what the hold up was.\n\nOur waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.  When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less.  \"Yeah, we know we're having problems.  You have 90 minutes, don't worry.\"  Lame.\n\nThere were still some very yummy rolls, but worth waiting an hour and a half for?  Not at all.  \n\nIt was very disappointing."

They even cut it infront of you at times. The service is great and we learned a lot about traditional sushi. From 12-4pm its their lunch special at $20.95..yes, appetizers and desserts. Dinner cost $24.95. I highly recommend it."
