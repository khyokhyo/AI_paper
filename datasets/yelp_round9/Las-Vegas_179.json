The service was great as you would expect. My meal was delicious. However, for the price I would probably go to outback instead. Sure this place was waaaay better but $173 for two people to eat a steak and vegetables?  Out of my league."

            "review": "Mastro's never disappoints.\n\nBut their Ocean Club locations, in my opinion is the better than their \"Steak House\" locations, because the ambiance is quieter and more enjoyable. \n\nThis is our second time visiting this location, and both times we have left extremely happy and full.\n\nThe first visit we didn't make reservations, but they were able to accommodate since it was a Monday, this visit we made reservations, but it was on a Monday as well, so they weren't busy anyway.\n\nThe staff was very helpful and provided excellent service; never had to ask for our water to be refilled and were always attentive asking if we were doing okay. \n\nFood: We started the meal off with escargot and bone marrow. Both items were very delicious. Mastro's is honestly the only restaurant where their marrow is enjoyable because it is cooked to the point where there is zero blood, I don't know if that is the correct way to cook marrow, but that's my personal preference. My boyfriend loves their escargot. It is cooked, buttered, and seasoned perfectly. As for our entree we shared their Colorado rack of lamb as well as their saut\u00e9ed spinach. Both items were cooked excellent as well. To end the night we ordered their famous warm butter cake. In all honesty, their butter cake is the main reason we love Mastro's. There isn't anything like it. The warm, sweet, soft cake paired with the vanilla ice cream just go so well together. \n\nOverall, we love Mastro's and anytime there is a location we are staying at, we make it a goal to check that location off the list. So far we have been to the Newport Beach and Beverly Hills location here in SoCal, and the location in Chicago. It is so good, how can you not!"

From the service (Our server was Tim) , to the food, there is not one thing I can say that was not excellent. We ordered the scallops again, which were as good, if not better than the first time. The clam chowder and chop salad were tasty. The biggest difference was how the steaks were prepared. My bone in ribeye was perfect. Each bite was tender and juicy, make sure to order the Mac n cheese side dish.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place. Thanks, Dan!"

I'm sure the food is good but it's been 45 minutes and I still haven't received mine. The steaks just came out but the order was wrong so off they went. I guess the good thing is that the wine numbed my pain due to my empty stomach."

For our entree we had shared the wagyu tomahawk steak with gorgonzola mac n cheese and creamed corn. For a tomahawk given it's size it was actually cooked quite well at a medium rare. The creamed corn was actually the best I've ever had so buttery and creamy felt totally decadent! Service was excellent and personal. We went with our 2 young kids and the staff took care of us all. Will definitely go back to try other things on the menu!"

The rack of lamb was excellent and the lobster mash was delicious. We started with the calimari which was lightly breaded and very juicy rings. Save room for the buttercake desert. Enough for 2 and tastes great with the fresh whipped cream they serve with it. Overall, great place to eat dinner for steak and seafood. Great atmosphere and service."

            "review": "Truly a study of excess starting with the \"tree house\" in the middle of the Crystals Mall.  The excellent food is also a study of excess especially if you are not a huge eater!  Starting with the Escargot, served in the shell swimming in butter and garlic with a wonderful assortment of breads on the side.  Best I have had in a long time.  The entree of Ahi Tuna Sashimi was huge (10 oz.) and perfectly cooked (virtually uncooked!) was a real treat.  The scallops were also more than generous, perfectly seared and served in a wonderful creamy sauce with toast points.  We decided to splurge and went for the $37 lobster mashed potatoes and were not disappointed, only bad part is this really would be too much for a table of four instead of 2 but we managed to eat all the lobster anyway.  Service was flawless.  As you might imagine the bill was part of the excess, cocktails, wine, shared app, entrees with side and a shared desert came to about $260 but it was fun!"

            "review": "I have never been to a fancy steakhouse before, and I have learned that they are incredibly awesome!\n\nWe booked a reservation ahead of time, so getting seats were very convenient and we were seated right away. Our server for the evening was Craig and he was a very personable man, who was very helpful throughout the entire evening. He had an answer for any question I threw his way and he explained things that they were offering off the menu very well as well. \n\nOur appetizer came out first, which were their ahi tuna tostadas. They were very delicious. The tostada portion was very crunchy and had the perfect texture. The avocado and tuna that they served on the tostada were so soft and had a buttery texture, which was heaven in my mouth. Our entrees then came out with our sides. I ordered the bone in ribeye with an 8oz prawn, while by brother ordered the Kansas City strip. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. I ordered mine medium and my brother ordered medium-well, and it came out exactly as expected. For our sides, we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes along with creamed spinach. The lobster mashed potatoes were supposedly their most popular side, and I can see why. They had a good amount of lobster in that dish and it added a nice change to plain mashed potatoes. The creamed spinach was very creamy and rich. I personally could only handle so much, but they did prepare it very well. Since we went there for my birthday, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for me to eat, and it was a 5 layered chocolate cake. Their cake is some of the best cake I have ever had. I have no way to describe the taste besides \"clean.\" It stayed together very well, the flavor wasn't too strong, and the texture was perfect. \n\nTo say the least, the service and food was some of the best I have ever had all in all. I definitely could not eat here on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this will definitely be on the list."

And I haven't even scratched the surface yet.   \n\nWith all the eating going on in Vegas, I could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic Campagna Burrata salad.  \nBut I couldn't resist and...\n\n...order more pretzel rolls.  They were just too addicting.\n...try their Brussel Sprouts.  Lightly salted to perfection.\n...taste the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  One order can feed an army.  \n...sample their Petite Filet.  Medium rare truly melted in my mouth.\n...and savor the Seared Sea Scallops.  Cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q?select=krtNnXcIArthzdx-FQ1_RA#MwXtyVuKcCbgmgFiZySLuQ)\n\nJust when I thought it was over, I was reminded of their infamous Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  So I had to be a teamplayer and try a little.  It was heavenly.  No matter how full we were, dinner was not complete without indulging in this popular dessert...and the accompanying gigantic bowl of whip cream. I discovered that 10 spoonfuls is \"just a little taste\" when it comes to this cake topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. Ay! \n\nTheir mysterious live piano artist kept us entertained and added a nice touch to the ambiance of not only the restaurant, but around all of Crystals mall. \nThis will not be the last time I dine here, that's for sure. Even though we were running late to a Yelp event, it was well worth it!"

So, needless to say I was yet again pleased with my experience at the Las Vegas location. \n\nHonestly, I was a bit reluctant it being inside a mall, even though yes its the Crystals mall (which is not any average mall). We were seated at a table overlooking the edge, which kind of gave the appeal of being near a cliff. The host who greeted us was extremely friendly and personable. Our server greeted us within a few minutes and went over the menu and a couple items he suggested.   \n\nWe started with the foie gras and escargot for appetizer. The escargot was average but the foie gras was delicious. Served with some sprigs of green and toasted bread. We also enjoyed half a dozen oysters on a half shell. We then moved on to have our entrees. Japaleno tuna sashimi definitely recommend this item. Truffled gnocchi was delicious as well as the creamed spinach. \n\nDiscovered a new wine as well, Leviathian, a red blend from St. Helena California. Extremely smooth and vibrant!\n\nStill not disappointed with Maestro's"

            "review": "From start to finish, our experience with Mastro's was wonderful. Ruben and I brought his cousin, Daisy here during one of her Vegas trips. Since there was a little bit of a wait for a table, we decided to hang out at the bar. The whole space feels large with the open-air setting in The Crystals. The beautiful decor and low lighting creates an elegant atmosphere. The bar was pleasant and we enjoyed our beverages, including a couple crafted cocktails. \n\nWe didn't even have the opportunity to finish our drinks by the time our table was ready! We were seated near the edge of the restaurant (near the \"Treehouse\"), so we had a view of the shops and open area with half our seating as a booth and the other half, chairs. It was really nice and very comfortable.\n\nWe started with Fried Calamari, served with fresh lemon (in a mesh, love it) and aioli. The breading appeared thicker than I normally like, but the squid was fresh and it was tasty. Ruben and I shared the Filet Mignon, medium rare, and Mastro's Crusted Salmon. The three of us shared the side dishes: Creamed Corn, Potatoes Au Gratin, Gorgonzola Macaroni & Cheese, and Steamed Broccoli. The steak was prepared perfectly and scrumptiously tender, the salmon was so flavorful, and the sides were all delicious.\n\nEverything about our meal was enjoyable. The prices are similar to those of high end steakhouses, but the portions were generous. We were able to take home a lot of food! To round everything out, the service was impeccable. It is one of our favorite steakhouses and favorite recommendations."

We started with the steamed mussles and bread basket. mussels were good however quite small. Bread was aldo good no complaints. I had the 18oz bone-in filet, Oscar style something I've always wanted to try.  The amount of crab meat was generous and the bernaisse sauce was good. Worth the extra $25.  My wife got the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass and it did not dissapoint. As for sides we ordered half orders of the lobster mash, green beans and the mushrooms. The amount of food was way too much for the two of us. The lobster mash was good but not worth the $18. We could've gone without it. Better off using that money to get your steak Oscar style. Much more satisfying.  Staff was professional and attentive. Drinks were really good ad well. For dessert we got a complimentary butter cake which very good but we were to stuffed at that point to really enjoy it. \n\nI took one star away because I had my steak packed to-go for a midnight snack and when I open the box I find that there was only one piece of crab. I know I had at least 4-5 pieces left. I really wouldn't have been able to eat it all but it's the principle.\n\nAnyway I would visit Mastro's again but order less."

            "review": "After living in Vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal I've had.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.\n\nService\nThe first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our \"leader\" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of \"oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you.\"\n\nMaybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.\n\nIf you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are \"good\".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like \"what do you mean\"?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....\"oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled\"....thanks.\n\nThis was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.\n\nI will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.\n\nNeedless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better."

It's funny . . . we live in Scottsdale, home of the original Mastro's and Mastro's Ocean Club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in Las Vegas. Having never been to Mastro's Ocean Club in Scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! We are so glad we did!\n\nThe space itself is very unique in design. We were seated in the \"Tree House\". It is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the Crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. It is very light and airy. There is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a Friday night.\n\nOur waiter (I think his name is Robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. He was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. He gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  The rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. Having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and I think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! When I couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. I didn't have to flag anyone down.\n\nThe food was top notch, bar none!  We started with the ahi tuna tartare. It was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what I believe were panko chips. Fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! Not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an Ocean Club Salad to split - fabulous! And, huge! It had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. At that point, I issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order ONE side. Hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. Bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! I couldn't even finish it. The twice baked potato was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!  \n\nOne other note . . . and this was pure genius. I couldn't finish my wine. If I put anything more into my stomach, I think I would have exploded! Our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. Apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. Thinking I am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it! \n\nWithout a doubt, this was the best meal we had in Vegas over this three-day holiday. And despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, I beg to differ. The quality of the service and food were spot on. We had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. Not so at Mastro's Ocean Club. \n\nI think I have finally convinced my husband to make the Scottsdale Mastro's Ocean Club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . I hope it lives up to the Las Vegas outlet!"

As a frequent customer to Mastro's I'm annoyed by the way management is handling us as consumers due to a fraud alert on our credit card.  Very impersonal, humiliating and overall disgusting.  We did enjoy the meal but don't feel I'll ever return to any Mastro's in the near or far future.  They even told us after trying to pay that chase visas have been an issue.  AFTER eating that is....BTW the credit was fine and all resolved but treated as lepers as we leave.  HORRIBLE"

It was our last night in Vegas. My dad had raved about Mastro's mac n' cheese for years. So we decided to have some for dinner! \n\nI admit, I was a little worried that we wouldn't be treated well, being that we were not ordering high priced steaks or seafood. That was definitely NOT the case. We had extremely attentive, first class service the entire time. We decided to eat in the bar so we wouldn't take a table away from steak lovers, and since we were more casual. There was live music, which was loud but not impossible to talk over. \n\nOur waitress was just awesome. She explained to us that the portions of the sides were huge and we definitely could share. We appreciated this since we didn't need leftover food. We ordered mac n' cheese, asparagus, and drinks. I had the paloma, a grapefruity drink. It was good! Not overly sweet. My friend loved her berry lemonade. Bread was brought out and was very fancy! There were different kinds of rolls, crackers, breadsticks, and pretzel sticks. Very yummy! \n\nOur meals came out and WOW... the sides were huge! Our waitress served us everything... and whenever we finished, she came to refill our plates. Very classy! We ordered pomegranate martinis on the way through our meal and again... WOW. They were amazing! Order one! They come in a shaker, and are poured table side. There is enough for more than one. The waitress came over and refilled our glasses as needed too. \n\nWe finished every single bite of the mac n' cheese and asparagus. And were full. Too full for dessert. The meal was $100! I can only imagine what it would be with steaks. But it was $100 worth it. \n\nThis would be the first place I'd come back to eat at in Vegas!"

            "review": "Definitely not impressed. Read several reviews online before deciding that this would be where my husband and I would have dinner on our last night in Vegas. The only good things about my experience were the bread basket and the scallops appetizer. I had a petite filet and was not impressed. I ate maybe half of it. I would have thought that when our server saw that I had stopped eating that he would have asked if everything is ok. I did not want to complain so I didn't say anything and that is where I messed up. A manager stopped by and asked how everything was and that was after maybe 1-2 bites before I realized exactly how poor my steak was. I always order a filet when I go out for a nice meal and now I am wishing that I had just ordered the appetizer instead of wasting money on eating half of a meal. I am now back in my hotel room trying to figure out if I should try to go somewhere else to salvage my night and have something to eat. I will add that my husband had the ahi tuna sashimi and it was a very large portion and he enjoyed his meal. We ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and didn't even finish half of them, they were definitely nothing spectacular. There are way better dining options, so be careful what you order and if you don't like it then say something, unlike myself who is now out $125 for a mediocre dinner."

That's a bit harsh. \n- The cheesecake was superb! So smooth and creamy. I highly recommend a slice!\n- The men's bathroom looks like a women's bathroom!

We ordered the Mastro's Signature Seafood Tower of shrimps, lobster, Alaskan King crab legs, Alaskan Red King crab claws, and Kusshi oysters. The shrimps were plump & juicy, as was the lobster. The crab was sweet & succulent. The oyster were very fresh. On the side were cocktail sauce, mustard, and our favourite, atomic horseradish, where a little goes a long way! In addition to the seafood tower, we had the Alaskan King crab black truffle gnocchi. As it approached our table, the smell of the black truffles was very evident. Atop the gnocchi was a parmesan & bread crumb topping, which was baked until golden brown. We added a few lemon drop martinis, which were pour table side. It steamed as the liquid touched the ice. \n\nThe service was amazing. The waiter was super friendly, and the water boys were attentive. I never saw the bottom of my glass.

It was about 4:45PM on a Thursday.  The bar is not incredibly large, but is it welcoming, tasteful, upscale and classy.  Their drinks are priced in the $15-$21 range, but are really the essence of a great mixologists and high style.  The cocktail list is extensive.

I noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was \"smoking\"... I think they put dry ice in it for effect!\n\nWhen we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. The bread including \"pretzel bread\" was a great appetizer too. The onion string serving size was HUGE and could have fed about 8 people. The escargot were in amazing sauce that I dipped my bread into afterward! \n\nThen, I ordered the Cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! He had the sea bass with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! We also shared the house mashed potatoes that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious. \n\nWhat a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport!

            "review": "This place is so good and totally worth the Vegas prices (note that you will probably spend about $100 per person). From reading many Yelp reviews, I developed a strategy. Share one of the bigger steaks with one person (because it's cheaper that way) and then split the sides with everyone. You will be super full - unless you love steak so much that you just have to have your own. I think the way most people do it is that they order their main dish - whether it be steak or seafood - and then you order a bunch of sides that the servers split and put on your plate.\n\nWe came with a party of six, and so here's what we got: \n\n- I split a 12 oz filet with one other person, and they will totally plate it for you if you tell them you are splitting it. Two of my other friends split the 16 oz bone-in. And one of our friends got their special wagyu steak. I will say that I'm not a super huge fan of steak, but the steak here was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the wagyu was incredible. Best steak I've ever eaten - the perfect ratio of fat and meat made it just melt in your mouth. \n\n- Lobster Mashed Potatoes: We were on the fence about this side dish because some of the reviews were meh about it. However, I'd say get it! The big chunks of lobster in the creamy mashed potatoes makes it so delicious. If you like lobster and mashed potatoes, definitely go for this dish. They put quite a bit of lobster in here - hence the hefty price tag of $35. \n\n- Alaskan Crab Truffle Gnocchi: This is super delicious as well. The gnocchi is soft and pillowy the way it's supposed to be and the truffle flavor is perfect. I didn't really get pieces of crab in the serving I got, but I know the crab was in there. \n\n- Brussel Sprouts: This was the only dish that was actually not done well to me. I like my brussel sprouts with a bit of caramelization and soft on the inside. Some of these just tasted incredibly burnt and the flavor wasn't great. I would pass on this as a side next time. \n\n- Mac & Cheese: This mac & cheese was pretty excellent. The noodles were cooked perfectly and it was amazingly cheesy. It was so cheesy that it did that stringy cheese thing when the server put it on our plate. A classically delicious side! \n\nFor dessert, we listened to the rave reviews and got the butter cake. And you know what, it was underwhelming to me. I like desserts that are lighter and less sweet, especially after we got such a crazy rich meal. The warm butter cake is extremely rich, it comes with a dollop on ice cream on top and a side of whipped cream. It is more than enough to share between six people, especially after the meal we had. I personally thought it was too rich and sweet, but enough people have raved about it on here that you should give it a try. \n\nThe service here is very good. I especially appreciate that our server stopped us from getting two sides of the gnocchi. He thought it would be wayyy too much food for us and he was totally right. All in all, this was an incredibly rich and decadent meal and totally delicious. I would definitely come back again for some of the things we got."

We were in Vegas for my boyfriend's birthday and knowing that he loves steak, I got us a reservation at Mastros after seeing the high reviews. I left a little note with my reservation on Open Table stating that it'll be my boyfriend's birthday and requested to be seated in the tree house. We got everything we wanted and more!!\n\nFirst off, we got there about 5-10 minutes early but the hostesses seated us right away. They even greeted him happy birthday and sparked a lovely conversation with us while walking us to our table. She was so friendly and made us feel comfortable knowing that it was our first time dining with them. \n\nWhen we were seated, our waitress (whom I wish I remembered her name because she was simply the greatest) got us all settled with drinks and everything. She too greeted my boyfriend happy birthday and went on to tell us her recommendations since we were new to their menu. My boyfriend jumped at hearing the tomahawk steak so we went with that for him. Me, I'm not really a steak person but I really wanted to try their lobster mashed potatoes and their king crab black truffle gnocchi. I couldn't choose between the two so she said they can split half/half for me and make it an entree. Ahh, she made life so much easier! After we placed our orders, my boyfriend realized that he wanted some sides since his plates was just going to be a huge hunk of meat. So we asked her if we can add some saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and spinach if it wasn't too late. She made it happen! \n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, all the passing waiters or hosts all greeted my boyfriend happy birthday. We were so shocked cause damn, they made him feel like a king! Everyone knew it was his birthday and they made him feel super special, which I lovedddd. Our food came out after what seemed like barely 5-10 minutes, so quick! We didn't really hear her when she described how big the tomahawk was.. But when it came out, it was a huge 30-33 ounce steak..LOL . He devoured that thing till he couldn't any longer. Every bite melted in our mouths, it was delicious! They placed all the sides on our plates one by one, making us feel like royalty! Everything was delicious!!! They even brought him out a complimentary birthday cake and offered to take pictures for us. Overall, I was so mind blown by the superb service we had that night. My bf said I won best girlfriend of the year award for this dinner. (;\n\nExpensive? Yes. But it was worth every penny!! I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!"

But this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  Yay me!\n\nAnyhow, since it is rare back home in Honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  Myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) I opted for the petite filet.  I know, sad, right?  I got 8 ounces of meat!  Not the 12 ounces they ordered.  I got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  Mmmm I just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  I got it just the way I want it, which is actually hard to come by.  I'll take it the way I want it.  He says out loud, \"you think you know a person,\" when I ordered my meat rare.  Oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how I like my meat?  As rare as can be is how I like it and I got a true piece of meat perfection.  You know that I ate all of it!  I love me some meat!\n\nThe rest of the dishes were typical.  Salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  The portions for those items are generous, I must say.  We did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  I think it was a shiraz.  I didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  And since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  Not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  One was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  How nice, right?  We couldn't finish the desserts, but I must say they were very rich and of course yummy.\n\nWould I return again?  Most definitely!  It's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.

At the tail end of our trip we had reservations for Mastro's Ocean Club.  It was pretty grand, let me tell you.\n\nThe service is simply superior.  You're not going to get a higher class feeling, especially for being inside a mall.\n\nWe had the lobster mashed potatoes and onion rings for the table (the onion rings were AMAZING), and we each ordered a different drink (personally, I ordered Dragon Fire, which was tequila with all sorts of sweets and a jalapeno topping).  \n\nOur main meals were all impressive in their own ways.  I ordered the lamb, which was simple and delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, which was cooked to his perfection and would've rated this place 5 starts.  My neighbor ordered the ribeye, and was displeased with the outcome.  My neighbor ordered medium rare for his ribeye, and my partner ordered medium-well for his filet mignon (because he will NEVER eat bloody meat), and my neighbor's ribeye was much more well cooked than the filet mignon.  My neighbor's experience was lackluster, but TRUST ME, had my neighbor said something to the server immediately it would've been fixed ASAP.  My neighbor didn't want to make a big deal, so he just said something at the end of the meal that it was okay, and he ate it, but he wasn't happy with it because of how well it was done.  The server was very apologetic and took the ribeye off our bill.  His girlfriend had the mussels, and she thought they were good but wasn't floored by the textxure.\n\nMastro's was great, but this is definitely one of the restaurants I go to once because I don't want to have another meal while watching ostentatious women picking out what they want at Balenciaga across the way with a perfect view.  It was annoying."

All which were really good, but not enough to say I would go back again."

            "review": "If I could give this place 100 stars I would.  \n\nFound this steakhouse on Yelp and 4  1/2 stars rarely disappoints so I made reservations via Open Table.  I found a few websites suggesting other steakhouses but I found them all to be owned by famous people and didn't want to dine at place based on being known by their owners.  I'm so glad I went with Mastro's.  So first off, yes, it is in a mall but I had no issues with that.  We sat in the 'treehouse' which faced all the high-end stores but never did I think it was awkward.  I mean....high-end steakhouse in a high-end mall, surrounded by high-end retail stores.  Nothing wrong with that.  What really counts is the FOOD and ambiance.\n\nFor a little less than $200, my husband and I each ordered an appetizer, salad, drink, an entr\u00e9e, and shared a side dish.  We had a late lunch so didn't order many sides.  We got the Brussel sprouts which were more than enough for two people.  A third would've been ok too.  The steak was DELSIH!  I have to say prob the best steak I've EVER had and I've had some of the best.  The steak literally MELTS in your mouth and before I even moved my knife to cut it, the tip of the knife t split the top of the steak open, that's how tender their steak is.  At first I was like whoa, $17 for a drink?  Well, you get them for free at the casino for a reason....it's prob watered down and not the best quality alcohol.  $17 actually gets you what appears to be more like two drinks as they leave the shaker on your table and that serves another glass.  By the way, the drinks were all delish as well.\n\nThe other highlight of the night, as if it wasn't the food itself wasn't enough, was the staff.  Our waiter Daniel Ellery was awesome.  Not only was he super nice and very courteous, but he was very knowledgeable about the menu.  My pet peeve is when you ask about certain dishes and how they are prepared and the waiter say, \"Oh, I don't know.  Let me get back to you.\"  Anyhow, I really enjoyed our dinner and the ambiance.  Everything was perfect for my birthday weekend, which by the way, they brought out a very lovely chocolate cake.  I'm not usually a sweets person but this cake was sooooo good.  Not too sweet and creamy.  It was delish!\n\nWill definitely be back in the future."

The waiter had just a little trouble pouring the wine, but other than that he did an outstanding job and was very efficient. I prefer a darker feel to a steakhouse and with the Ocean club being in the mall that was hard to achieve. Overall I would definitely go again. Bone in rib eye was a little undercooked but excellent. And the butter cake dessert off the hook good."

I finally went earlier this week, and was extremely impressed with the decor and the service (everyone from the host stand to the waiter -- service is top notch here).  When the menu came, I was in a seafood eater's heaven!!  Their seafood, which ranges from the traditional (tuna, salmon, swordfish) to the the more interesting (opakapaka and chilean seabass), is flown in fresh.... and that's what allows Mastro's to keep the flavors simple so that the fish remains the star on the plate.  I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass and my man went for their jumbo lobster tails.  Brilliance.   The group we were with also ordered almost all the sides on this menu and stand outs were the creamed spinach, the asparagus, and the sauteed mushrooms.   Their wine list is also pretty extensive and the sauvignon blanc was fantastic.   We skipped dessert because we were too full... but the tea we had (they have really interesting flavors, including chocolate coconut) was a perfect compliment to a great meal.  Given the choice between Bartolotta (see my review) and Mastro's, I would take Mastro's any day.  Bravo, Mastro's, on a job well done!!"

Yes, but you're worth it!  \nHubby took me for my x0th bday. \n\nFirst order of the night were drinks and appetizer. I ordered a lemon drop and surprised that the whole shaker remained on the table. I had probably 3-4 glass servings. There was dry ice in my martini glass so the fog effect was a nice treat!  For appetizer, we shared the crab cake which was just enough for us two. They brought out the bread (different types) and ALL freshly baked!  We also shared a Caesar salad per recommendation of our server cuz it was a good size. Not your average Caesar - you can tell is was all from scratch down to the anchovies.  For the main course, I ordered a 6oz filet and hubby ordered 12oz. Both perfect as expected. For the sides, we had the lobster mash potatoes (OMG!) and saut\u00e9ed asparagus. All of it was scrumptious. Finally, they brought me my bday cake - butter cake topped with vanilla ice cream and a side of housemate whipped cream.  It was yummy and rich, But truly, this could be shared by six people, I barely scratched the surface. \n\nGreat atmosphere, great servers, awesome food!"

I checked on Yelp and it was rated pretty high at 4.5 with 589 reviews. The final selling point was that it is open until 1 am which makes sense in Vegas. It is a pain to make it to a show and have dinner finished by 10 pm. A lot of the supposed higher end restaurants could do a lot better job on their hours in Vegas. Mastros does and so it got our reservation. We had a great dinner, the sea food tower was stacked and very well done. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the steaks and fish meals were great and not a complaint was raised at the table. The wine was recommended and reasonable. Not to mention very well paired to the meal. Thanks to Dion (our waiter), for a really enjoyable evening. He made the night work for everyone, even though it started off a little shaky. A bit more attention by the host staff when dropping people in the bar to wait on their table would have earned 5 stars. \n\nHowever, we would go back in a heartbeat."

It's part of the Mastro's chain, which I was familiar with before my visit from their store in Beverly Hills.  Despite the intimidating size of the City Center complex, if you park in the Crystals valet, getting in and out is really pretty easy.  The restaurant is everything you would expect from an eatery at this price point and more.  The service is immaculate and attentive. (I particularly like the flourish that comes with the simultaneous presentation of all of the table's entrees.)  Also, the manager came over and checked on us to make sure everything was perfect as well.  This restaurant has the steaks that you would expect from the Mastro's name but its primarily focus is seafood. (Thus the \"Ocean Club\" moniker.)  The quality and preparation are top notch.  In terms of the facility itself, part of the dining area sits in a stylized banyan tree. (Really.)  It certainly makes a statement and is definitely where the cool kids want to sit.  Finally, while it will shave months off of your life, you absolutely must have the butter cake desert - I lack the vocabulary to describe how utterly scrumptious this myocardial infarction inducing item is."

It \"worked\" very well.\nI've had better (more garlic/butter) escargot but these were pretty good.  Lobster bisque was more than acceptable. Ocean Club salad was tasty and cold but they use iceberg lettuce (really?).  Mussels were decent.  Bone Marrow was interesting but way overpriced.\nSea Bass was nice, light tasty.  Blackened grouper was pretty good.  They served both the scallops and the lamb underdone.  They promptly took both back to the kitchen and when they re-served them (just three minutes later), the scallops were acceptable but the lamb was completely awesome.  The lamb was hot with the proper amount of crust and perfectly medium rare. (Why didn't they do that the first time?) The lamb was the winner, for sure.\n(I glanced at other tables' filets ... too small.  It didn't look appetizing.)\nBrussels sprouts were delicious.  The lobster mashed potatoes were too liquidy.  What WAS that liquid?  They totally should've been thicker.\nFor dessert (ugh, we were so full but we just HAD to have dessert) was the cherry crisp.  Tasty but needed more cherry.  The ice cream was nice and the freshly-made whipped cream was awesome.  Plenty for four people.\nWith tip (including two drinks and everything mentioned, above) for four people, the check came to $480 (incl. $80 tip).\nYes, it was overpriced but it was a fun experience, very nice service (including lots of amenities in the men's bathroom) and the food was pretty good, overall.  Not sure we'd go back (because it's so expensive) but certainly nice when you're on vacation and want to splurge a little."

We got put in a corner, right next to the server station, where we heard the servers chitter chatter throughout our whole meal, the wooden doors slamming as they grabbed items for tables was very annoying. It was just not the feel my boyfriend and I wanted for a romantic Valentine's. The food itself was very delicious. Our waiter did try and rush us throughout the whole meal.

Service was prompt; the waitress delightful and extremely knowledgeable. This was literally the best meal I have ever shared with my boyfriend of nearly a year. Each item was split and served on two plates in perfect presentation: the heirloom tomato salad, the blackened halibut. The brussel sprouts and lobster mash potatoes were of plenty proportions - and the mash had the most perfect creamy flavor with an abundance of lobster. The variety of breads were served warm with soften tabs of butter. Ever staff person was attentive. The drinks, a pomegranate martini and cucumber cooler, were a homerun. I've never tasted something better in my life. If I had the room, I know the butter cake would kick butt of any cake I ever ate (I'm going back today to make sure). And the coffee served at the end of the meal was the testament that the entire meal was EPIC. Thank you Mastro!"

This wine had so many flavor profiles going on. It also went really well with all of the meat that we ordered. The wine was very smooth with plenty of fruity flavors to it. \n\nSauteed spinach: Your basic saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic. I would rather suggest ordering the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n\nScalloped potatoes: It was good, but it wasn't excellent. I would have liked more cheese added to my scalloped potatoes. Also, the potatoes seemed to be slightly undercooked and hard. \n\nBone-in ribeye: A great piece of meat with excellent meat to fat ratio and amazing flavor. I would definitely order this again. \n\n18 oz bone-in filet mignon: Ordered rare plus, this meat was so tender. Unfortunately it wasn't seasoned that well so I had to add salt and pepper to each bite. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed dining at this Mastro's location, but if I had to choose between this location and the location in Costa Mesa, I would have to choose the Costa Mesa location. The service at both locations were excellent, but I would have to say that I slightly enjoyed the food more at the Costa Mesa location."

I ordered the bone in rib eye.... my favorite!  I would say that its not as good as Del Frisco's but still very good.  The hottie got the sea bass which was excellent.  We started off with fried calamari which was nothing special.  For sides we got creamed spinach which was pretty good and gorgonzola mac n cheese which was not good.  I'm not a big fan of gorgonzola from the start so it wasn't a surprise that I did not like it that much.  But the hottie is a big fan of gorgonzola and even she said it wasn't good.  We loved the tree house look and its a first class place.  We even saw Pete Rose there with a...... ahem companion.  Overall thumbs up!"

We were seated in the treehouse - beautiful and romantic, great date spot. \nReally unique cocktail list -definitely not the usual boring drinks. I tried the blueberry martini, didn't really care for the taste since I prefer sweet drinks, but it was strong and something different. Cocktails were a little pricey at about $18 each, but you pay for the ambiance. \nStarted w escargot, I've never had it served in the shell before. Very pretty and delish - served w clarified butter and garlic. Great selection of yummy breads too. \nWe shared the 18oz bone in Kansas city strip w twin lobster tails (1 butter poached, 1 vanilla tempura fried). Sides - twice baked potato and brussel sprouts w bacon. Steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender, juicy and flavorful. They knew we were sharing so everything was split for us. Poached lobster was good, cooked perfectly. The tempura lobster... mmm I'm not a huge fan. It was good, but a LOT of batter and I didn't really get even a hint of vanilla. Glad we decided to try it both ways. \nTwice baked potato was good, but I've had better. They didn't bring it out till about 10min after the rest of the food because the chef didn't like how the first one looked, so he made a new one. They took it off the bill w out us asking. Nice that the chef has attn to detail vs just cranking out the orders. Brussel sprouts used to be fried w pancetta but they recently changed the menu, so no more pancetta. They did accommodate by doing it w bacon instead, but not really the same - thin sliced bacon just can't compare to chunks of pancetta.\nWe got the butter cake comp since it was an anniversary. Super cute of them to do a candle. The cake is enough for 3 or 4 to share, served w vanilla ice cream and a huge bowl of fresh whipped cream. So bad, but soooo good! \nService was excellent, our server Mike was friendly and knowledgeable. The rest of the wait staff were great too. I checked out our neighbors food, I'm looking forward to trying the seabass, seared tuna, or crab salad next time. \nIn the end there's not a huge difference w steak joints - they generally serve the same cuts, appetizers and sides. But Mastro's stands apart with its service and intimate classy ambiance."

While in Vegas staying at the Aria we had a group here for dinner and basically ate the menu (bill was almost 4000).  Everything was pretty good but the steak was probably the worst I've ever had.  I ordered a bone in filet which was almost $60 which was fatty and undercooked (ordered medium rare).  Didn't send it back because I wasn't interested in eating more food since we had so many appetizers and we had desserts coming.

I had to ask twice to be moved to somewhere more quiet because I could not be heard over the singer. Fortunately we were seated shortly away from the bar, but the noise level was still very high. I would not return no matter how good the food just because of the noise level.\n\nThe food. We split a Caesar salad, which was OK but too salty and over dressed. We had to ask for some bread. My wife loved her scallops. My swordfish was very thick and looked delicious. It, however, was a little over cooked, and fairly bland. It did not have that grilled flavor I love on fish. The waiter recommended the lobster mashed potatoes ($38), so we got that and the green beans with slivered almonds. If you do not absolutely love lobster, take the $10 baked potato instead. I do not like my veggies over cooked, but the beans were way under done. After dinner decaf coffee was just OK and served in a large cup, but we not offer a refill until we were ready to leave. Key Lime Pie was a large slice, but I've had much better."

My favorite tables are located within the \"tree house\" because who doesn't want to be in a tree house? =)\n\nI've been there a bunch of times and below are some of my favorite food items:\n- Alaskan King Crab Legs - (Available by the pound) Comes out warm and ready to eat with the shells already cracked open. They serve it with melted butter but I prefer their cocktail sauce instead.\n- Cocktail Sauce - Yes, I put this in it's own category LOL. It's AMAZING. This is the best cocktail sauce I have ever had. It has the perfect amount of kick.\n- Shrimp Cocktail - huge, plump, and delicious! One order includes 3 shrimps. It comes out in an entertaining presentation because of the dry ice below the bed of ice.\n- Dungeness Crab Cocktail - This is probably the best value for the seafood tower appetizers. You get a bunch of crab meat with a few different sauces: cocktail (again, its the best!), Mastro's mustard, and extra horse radish (super strong). \n- Bone-In Rib Eye - They seem to cook a little more on the rare side. Possibly because the plate comes out at 400 degrees. (Be careful!) The meat tastes fabulous alone but they do offer Bearnaise and Peppercorn sauce as an option.\n- Sea Scallops - Perfectly cooked and savory (Appetizer portion has 3, Entree portion has 5.)\n- Signature Warm Butter Cake - THIS IS THE BEST DESSERT EVER!!!! Warm butter cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and served with a huge side of whipped cream. It is quite large and well worth the price! Serves 3-4 people easily. \n\nThe service is genuine and attentive. If you put any notes in your reservation such as a special celebration, they pay close attention to it. It was so nice to not worry about telling the server it was my boyfriend's birthday.\n\nI know I listed a bunch of my favorites, but if you could take away anything from this review, TRY THE BUTTER CAKE! =)"

They should really try to find a better location with better ambiance. \n\nC) Food. Really good ( almost) There were 4 of us and we all ordered some variation of a fillet. Mine came out perfect, but my wife ordered hers medium rare and it came out close to well done. We were having such a good time with our friends that she didn't want to spoil the scene and return the steak. Otherwise everything was great including the shaker that they bring to your table with your cocktail, so that you actually can 2 glasses of booze for $18 rather than one. \n\nOverall, another great steakhouse in Vegas. Probably won't come back. Not because it was poor, but just because there are so many other places to explore in this restaurant town."

We got there at 8 promptly and were seated at the first table by the entrance.  It has its pros & cons.

I hope he will read this review, but if not, I hope other diners will ask for Rob as he is really awesome.  He is very sincere and does just enough to make you feel welcomed and taken care of.

We were on a bit of tight schedule as we have a show to watch at 10 p.m.  at the Mirage and Rob did everything he could to get us of out there in time for the show.  Thank you so much Rob for a wonderful dinner experience!"

            "review": "WOW I was pretty impressed with this place and I've done my share of dining in Vegas. The decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. That night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. That was my main complaint. \n\nOn to the food. We started with the seafood tower and I wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but I gobbled everything up. It had jumbo shrimp cocktail, kunumoto oysters, crab claws, lobster, and king crab legs, the works. It was presented with dry ice. They served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too. \n\nI was pretty full so I opted to get a salad and I chose the iceberg salad. Now I have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. The waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. It was the BEST salad dressing I have ever had! I think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much I liked it.  It just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. YUM!\n\nI tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. Our favorite steak houses in Vegas are Michael's (Southpoint) and Cut (Palazzo) but I think Mastro's takes the cake on this. We had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but I heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although I was too stuffed to try. \n\nBut the best part of dinner was the dessert! We had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. Oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! I think that was better than the ice cream, I wanted to eat gobs of it. \n\nThis is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is VERY pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n"

            "review": "Mastro's really is as good as it gets.  They were so good, my bf and I came here twice during our three night excursion in Vegas.  The service here is impeccable, the food top notch and the ambiance exquisite and dramatic.  \n\nThe first time we were served on by Tanya who delivered exemplary service all night.  We ordered the seafood tower with beluga caviar, lobster, raw oysters, crab and shrimp.  Everything was fresh and even tastier with the atomic horseradish condiment, red onions, parsley, egg white, egg yoke and capers.  If you like it hot, the horseradish here is simply the best.  It will give you an amp, clear your sinuses immediately and possibly cause you to shed a tear.  The escargot was soft and delectable with a garlic and buttery taste.  I can't pick out what herbs they put on them, but there was a greater complexity on the palette to make it more interesting.  We ordered a nice bottle of Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc to compliment the seafood.  Dinner was so satisfying, we didn't have room for dessert, but we ended it with a couple of dirty martinis.  Unbeknownst to us, they also bring an entire shaker with the remnant vodka leftover!  Let's just say we left a little behind.\n\nUnfortunately, a couple hours later my bf fell ill, but I didn't.  As always when ordering raw shellfish, it's always a possibility to get a bad oyster.  It was only disappointing to have to end the night so soon.  However, the way Mastro's handled it was outstanding.  We didn't have to call them to inform them how our dining experience went.  They called the next day to make sure it was good.  I ended up speaking to Sherry and told her about our wonderful experience minus the bad oyster.  She was extremely empathetic and invited us back in to make it right.  We gladly accepted the invitation and dined at Mastro's again a couple days later.\n\nWe were seated in the tree house again and Lionel waited on us this time.  He was every bit charming with a sense of humor and also delivered immaculate service.  We both had to use restraint  from devouring the fine variety of artisan breads in the basket.  We both shared the Tomahawk Kobe Beef bone-in ribeye medium rare.  All I can say is wow!  This was the best steak ever.  The softness of each morsel, darker color and bolder flavor was a real pleasure for us.  We ordered the escargot again and tried the roasted brussell sprouts and sauteed spinach- both cooked to perfection and tasty.  Lionel recommended a nice cab which I can't remember what- maybe Hill?  Nevertheless, it was a perfect compliment to our steak.  We ended the meal with a nice sponge cake dessert with fruit, whip cream and a couple ports.\n\nDinner at Mastro's in their architectural masterpiece called the \"tree house\" was the perfect last dinner in Vegas before going home.  Their appreciation for their customers and solicitous attitude really make this place top notch.  We definitely appreciated all they did to compensate for the bad oyster from the first visit on our second visit.  We had an amazing time and are sure to return next time we are in Vegas. \n\nThank you Mastro's for a wonderful dining experience!"

            "review": "A good friend of ours suggested Mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the Strip. So I made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the Mastro's website. What I didn't know was that I had somehow clicked on the Chicago location. Luckily I was walking around the Crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. They were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) \n\nThe service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. Loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. \n\nThe food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi and the Signature Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. We had the bone-in Filet which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. \n\nDessert was over the top .. we had three .. Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake, \nthe Cherry Crisp, and the Profiteroles. The first two were topped with Vanilla Bean Gelato. Both were to die for. I had read lots about the Warm Butter Cake and it was everything I had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly I also loved the Cherry Crisp .. I am not huge on Cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the Crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the Gelato and fruitiness of the dish. It's something I would definitely order again! \n\nMy only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the Beef Carpaccio appetizer. Mom and I each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. Being in the service industry myself, I would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the Carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. \n\nAll in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back."

For two of us, without wine and dessert (the later was comp'd by our Mandarin Oriental Concierge) our tab was $230 + tip. I can say without hesitation having dined all over the world, and eaten at the best steak houses in NYC, Chicago, Palm Springs and LA, this was NOT a $230 meal. At best it was worth $120. \n\nFood= Our seafood appetizers were delicious - oysters and shrimp. For dinner we ate fillets, lobster, au gratin potatoes, and creamed spinach. The meat was good, lobster decent, and sides very disappointing. Usually this is what makes a Steak house memorable -not here.  The warm \"pretzel bread\" and butter cake dessert were by far the most memorable portions of the meal.\n\nAtmosphere = you're eating in a mall - albeit a beautifully designed mall with every luxury brand in the book, it's still a mall. Within the tree house where we dined, you watch mall walkers beneath you. Ouch.\n\nService= Very good, attentive, but not $230 good. \n\nOverall 3 stars. For all of us Zagat's goons, I'd go with Food=21, Decor=23, Service=23."

Not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal. \n\nI had the mambo salad (spicy caesar salad with no croutons), 8 oz. Petite filet and cheese cake for dessert. The filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of creamed corn, spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. Our table also shared the steamed mussels appetizer, which was excellent! Highly recommended!"

We arrived to a bustling restaurant and were seated at the bar. The bar is quite impressive. We ordered cocktails and as soon as they were poured, the hostess came to seat us. Another host came with a tray to take our drinks so we wouldn't have to carry them. Very nice touch. We headed to the \"treehouse\" and were seated. We had a wonderful view of the entire treehouse. The bar drinks were outstanding. Our waitress was attentive and polite. We ordered an appetizer which was good. I ordered the Sea Bass while my husband decided on the petit filet. As we were ordering, our waitress overheard us say we would share and offered to have both entrees split. We also ordered the lobster mash potatoes. When our entrees arrived, they both melted in our mouths. The filet was so tender and the sea bass was light and flaky. After enjoying our dinner, we ordered the butter cake we had heard was so magnificent. Indeed, it was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten. We WILL be back in April and we will be bringing friends. This was a real dining experience. My only regret was not trying it sooner."

            "review": "This is actually 3.5 stars.  So me and the guys had dinner here last night and as usual the food is excellent (5 stars).  \n\nThe reason for the lower rating was due to service and ambience.  I've been to other Mastro's and their service has always been top notch.  They always anticipated your needs and followed up quickly.\n\nOur main server here could have worked at Sizzler, Black Angus, Outback or any of those type of places and the clientele there would have thought he was good.  At Mastro's, not the case.  \n\nI am a low maintenance client and in the restaurant business so I understand how it can be.  But last night's dinner service wasn't busy and Mastro's has a pretty good wait staff to client ratio so our needs should have been met fairly easily.  \n\nMy biggest complaint are the lack of water initially and follow up afterwards.  We didn't get water until are appetizers were served.  There was never a follow up after any of the dishes were served.  This is pretty basic service for a fine dining establishment so I will not give you any leeway here.  \n\nMy other issue is more of a personal taste.  Mastro's is located in Crystals Shopping Center at CityCenter and has an \"open top\" feel with views of the mall.  The restaurant is not enclosed so it feels like I'm dining at a very expensive food court.  As with typical steak houses they are usually dark but here it's pretty bright.  I didn't feel like I had the full Mastro's steak house experience.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed the food and time with my friends I'm not sure I will go back since Vegas has a lot of dining options."

No eye contact when we arrived, no eye contact as we were speaking to her. We understood that there were extremely busy during the time and we had to wait, but interaction with the first person you encounter makes a big difference in your whole experience. The first encounter ruined our whole dining experience. We made the mistake of staying because we were so hungry even though we had to wait an extra half hour even with reservations. We were hoping the service after the first encounter would be better but the whole experience just felt rushed. The food was so so. The one star is for the Chilean Sea Bass which was excellent but the rest you can find at other similar restaurants. For the price you spend at a restaurant such as this, we expected better customer service at the very least.  Would not recommend as there are much better coptions in Vegas with similar menus, much better service, and much better ambiance (not in a mall)."

            "review": "What's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to Vegas? \"Go big, or go home\"? It basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. And Mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. But for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, Mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.\n\nLocated pretty centrally in the City Center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss Mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and I'm pretty sure I inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. Before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. You'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. And this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.\n\nAnd let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. Our waiter, Lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. We were -THAT- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. His service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience I have seen yet in years of visiting Vegas. Add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.\n\nBut all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and Mastro's has this base covered, too. Oh, do they ever. My folks started with a bowl of clam chowder and a caesar salad, while I went with the lobster bisque. All three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. Ahem. \n\nMom went with a red snapper that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which Lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best I've had at any place around the world. But the most surprising part was when Dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had sea bass before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his Chilean sea bass here was his favorite meal of this trip. A side of creamed corn and scalloped potatoes rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. Somehow, my folks found room for Mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. It's that good (even though I had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin I was drinking).\n\nI cannot say enough positive things about Mastro's. From the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. Take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: I promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of Blackjack."

I would give it 2.5 stars.  appetizers we had were calimari and Boston clam chowder.  the sauce that came with the calimari was not good.  The calamari was above average.  the soup seemed to lack a good seafood stock so flavor was absent although it had a good amont of clams.  we ordered two sides with dinner.   lobster mash potatoes was a good size serving but the lobster chunks were swimming in a puddle of butter.  could get the texture of th lobster meat but not too much on the flavor side.  string been were better bu similar.   I had the artic char.  seemed to lack flavor likely more than a day old.  sauce was tasty but I love the flavors of really fresh fish.  My wife had Chilean sea bass.   I had a bite at the end.  it was fishy like an old fish.   I have this dish often and this was the worst I have had.  I couldn't eat desert after this.   My kids had a new York steak and rack of lamb.  both were not cooked well and we're tough.  I am pretty sure I could have kicked as on the chef for these dishes.   the rack of lamb did have a good serving portion.  I was hoping I could be more positive and considered that my palate could be off because of something I ate earlier.  however the Chilean sea bass had some good flavors but was overpowered by bad fishy flavors."

Last night me and my friend Paul had the night off in Vegas so we decided to check out the Mastro's here in Las Vegas at City Center. It not the traditional Mastro's setting but the food was still remarkable! Our waiter Deion was the man he helped my friend choose the perfect wine to accompany his bone-in filet topped with foie gras! Which just melted in ur mouth! (Pause) I myself took down the 22oz Bone-in Ribeye cooked medium rare plus like a beast and enjoyed every single bite! Once again Mastro's was an A+! Pictured below was the Bone-in Ribeye."

            "review": "I read all these great reviews and I just don't get it.  I've eaten at the Beverly Hills location on several occasions and LOVED it.  I've tried on many occasions to duplicate the Tomatoes and Onions at home, but never the same.  I've been in Vegas 4 years now, and never knew that this was here until about 3 weeks ago.  It was so beautiful that i couldn't wait to try it.  Since it was my birthday, I said \"Lets go to Maestros.\"   Why am I the only person to have a bad experience here?\n\nThe waiters and bussers were waiters and bussers, no personality at all, but thats not what i went for, so no issue there.    I wanted the Tomatoes and Onions.  When the server sat the plate down, i asked \"Those are sweet onions, right?\"  He replied \"Yeah!\"  They were not. Three slices of tomato and 2 slices of a regular onion that you would put on a hamburger, burned the inside of the nose.  Calimari was very good.\n\nWe both ordered the 22 oz bone in rib eye, mine medium rare, my guest Medium, with a few sides:  Gargonzola Mac & Cheese (Pretty damn good), sauteed spinach, and Burnt Brussel Sprouts, which they were.  When they sat the plate down, the steaks looked like they were for Fred and Barney, and they tasted that old.  These were the worst steaks that I've ever had.  I sawed (literally) a piece off of each end and could not go any further. A chainsaw wouldn't help. The taste was like that of a 30 year old cow.  My asked asked \"Does yours taste like an old cow?\"  \"CLEARLY!\"  The busser asked if we wanted everything to go:  I said \"Sure, but please place this steak in a separate box\", as i intended to give it to one of the homeless people on the bridge.  When he heard us discussing how awful the meat was, busser told us that he could put it on the grill a little longer.  I told him that that wouldn't help it.  So, He boxed it up and the waiter gave us the check.  NO ONE (Manager, waiter, etc...) ever asked, from the time that the steak was sat down, \"How is it?\".  At Del Friscos, or Hugos Cellar, or descent restaurants they always say \"Please cut into the center and let us know if that is prepared correctly\", before they ever walk away.  I guess that they are tired of seeing the sawing action. After Paying, waiter said \"Till next time\" to which my guest replied \"there wont be a next time!\"\n\nTrust me, I really wanted this to be an awesome experience, as it was my birthday, the place is BEAUTIFUL, and it took some talking to get my guest to go with me.  Check was only $250, but $130 of that was a total waste.  I could NEVER go to this place again, not even for free."

This place is worth the hit on your bank account. \n\nThey took 5-star dining to a whole new level via a phone call the next day to see how our experience was the night before. Some patrons might not like this unsolicited call, but I didn't mind the show of courtesy. \n\nMust haves: bone-in ribeye, truffle crab gnocchi, and brussel sprouts. \n\nFurther proof they're all about customer service: they automatically split our entree in half for us (no split fee). Also, we were apprehensive about ordering the full order of the truffle gnocchi, so our server offered to give us a half portion (for exactly half the price: $16). This was NOT on the menu, and the half order is more than enough for 2 people (I can't imagine how huge the full order must be). If just two of you, I highly recommend you ask for the half portion and order something else. \n\nSo, here's a PERFECT meal at this Mastros for 2 people at ~$100 (no alcohol)-\n\n1. Bone-in Ribeye 22oz ($59)\n2. Half order of the Truffle Gnocchi ($16)\n3. Brussel Sprouts ($11), or whatever other side dish you prefer\n\nThat's A LOT of food for 2 people. Trust me. And everything's mindblowing. \n\nLastly, can another unoriginal idiot please post another unoriginal picture of the restaurant's structure? There aren't enough of them on yelp. Thanks."

The original number we 12, and I called 3 days before and had no problems getting a table.  By Saturday night, the number had ballooned to 16.  I was nervous about calling to change the reservation, but Mastro's called first and offered a private room which made it even easier to up the number to 16.  Many thanks to the Hostesses at Mastro's for being so easy to work with.  The service is here is friendly and confident, they know what they are doing.\n\nThe food continues to carry that confident theme.  Big, bold, and flavorful, the steaks here are serious...no sides to cover them up.  They are served to you \"naked\" with nothing else on the plate.  Sides can be ordered for the table and the sides pretty much all delicious.  Back to the steaks...Charred and flavorful on the outside, juicy and savory on the inside.  My mouth waters just thinking about it."

We got to sit under the Tree House that overlooks the Crystals Shopping Center.\n\nAfter waiting about 15 minutes to be seated, we started with the Seafood Tower because nothing says over the top LV dining like a seafood tower.  On this tower were jumbo shrimp, a variety of crab legs, and some oysters.  Served on the side were a traditional cocktail sauce, their atomic horseradish, and a mustard sauce.  I was a little too liberal with the horseradish sauce and can confirm that the \"atomic\" description is accurate.\n\nFor my main, I went with the Ribeye steak and the table ordered a variety of sides: lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, gnocchi, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes.  \n\nUnfortunately, the highlight of my meal were a few of the sides.  I really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, the gnocchi, and creamed spinach, all of which were excellent.  But my steak left a little to be desired.  It was flavorfull, but the piece of meat simply had too much gristle.  I appreciate a bit of fat on my steak, but this piece of meat had just a bit too much on and I had to cut around quite a bit of my meal.  Based on the other reviews, it sounds like my experience may have been out of the ordinary, but from my experience, there are better places to try in LV."

            "review": "As a newer Yelper, this is only my second review and beyond deserved.  On our most recent trip to Las Vegas last weekend, my boyfriend and I ended up unexpectedly at Mastro's Ocean Club in Crystals inside City Center for the first time.  We go to Vegas quite a bit (about once every 2 months or so) and have passed by this place quite a few times.  \n\nThe interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past... it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into Crystals when you are done with your meal (btw, this is a joke.  You do not get ejected from your seat.  It is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff).  My imaginative uses for the architecture aside, the design/layout is nice; it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of Crystals with a very open and airy feel.\n\nAs we were walking through Crystals on our way back to our hotel room at Aria from a long day of shopping, we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walk-ins on a busy Friday night.  With it being such an upscale spot, I was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time.  Au contraire!  They offered us immediate seating in the bar/lounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room.  Since we felt a bit underdressed for the location, we opted for the bar/lounge area and were glad we did.  We had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery red-headed chanteuse, who was pleasantly entertaining. \n\nWe were promptly greeted by our amazing server, Sara.  The only reason I know her name is because I made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as I knew I wanted to review this place.  Sara was so attentive, knowledgeable about menu, friendly, and always two steps ahead of us -  really as perfect as a server can get.  All of her recommendations were great as well.\n\nI had the swordfish (I hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet) and my boyfriend had the bone-in Ribeye.  We shared the most delicious side dish - the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.  My swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy.  However, my boyfriend's Ribeye wasnt anything stellar.  It wasnt as flavorful as a most quality Ribeyes should be.  It's on our do-not-order-again list.  This is an \"Ocean Club\" though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few non-seafood options.  Now,  for the absolute BEST part of the meal.... THE MOST HEAVENLY DESSERT EVER - Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible, which it was far from, I would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert!  I dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in Vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it.  This creation alone makes Mastro's Ocean Club one of my top 5 all-time favorite restaurants.  I would happily get ejected from this sea-faring vessel any time! ;)\n\nSorry for the ridiculously long review, but I had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it."

This is top notch service (white & black napkin service, hot hand towel service between courses, sides served onto your dish at the table, crumbing, etc.).  Notables not to miss: the crab cocktail - TRUST ME.  OMG...already shelled WHOLE pieces of crab - and so many!!!  The cocktails are awesome - do not be scared by the $15-20 prices each, you get about 2.5 martini glasses full, since they leave the cocktail shaker with (a lot) more in there.  \n\nWe also had the escargot, which was a little (too) salty, even for this dish but still good and they made for a unique appetizer.  We had 3 different types of oysters, which were also good, but that is not really a refection on this restaurant since a raw oyster is a raw oyster...but they were very cold and served on a platter with dry ice, and accompanied by three different sauces, which was neat.  We shared the bone-in prime ribeye as an entree.  It was good, but Flemings is better, in our opinion.  Maybe we got a weird cut?  The dessert they brought out (complimentary) for my husband's birthday was the butter cake with ice cream.  It was excellent - my husband took that home and ate it in bed, like a heathen!  He even woke up and had some more the next day!!!  For a side, we had the lobster mashed potatoes... they were good and we are both glad we got them, but they were not worth $36, nor was there 1.5 pounds of lobster, as advertised.  That was a bit of a bummer, but we are still glad we got them once - still a tasty treat!  \n\nNothing was bad or even just OK - it was all good and points were extremely excellent - The real stand outs were the crab cocktail, the service, and the alcoholic cocktails - these were far and above other nice restaurants!  \n\nWe are so thrilled to have found this place (via a birthday gift for my husband from a friend) and are very much looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other yummy options on the menu!\n\nTips: ask to sit in the bird's nest.  You can share a steak and a few appetizers and have PLENTY.  we took our whole dessert and some of our steak home and we are both big eaters.  ORDER THE CRAB COCKTAIL!"

We've been to both Mastro's in OC and the one in LA and this was by far the least pleasant visit. We've also been to a lot of the high-end restaurants in LV and typically skipped Mastro's because we could get it easily when we lived in SoCal. But now that we live out of state, we were craving BUTTER CAKE!\n\nWhen Mastro's called to confirm our reservations, we mentioned that we would be coming in straight form the airport, and they said it wouldn't be a problem to store our luggage during dinner. Upon arrival, they didn't have any room in the clutter closet behind the hostess stand. We brought our luggage to the dinner table which was slightly awkward but there was room.\n\nWe had two different main waiters and the service was a bit off. The appetizers were cleared from the table and placed on a stand next to us...not sure why they weren't just removed. Then the entrees came - we were warned about the hot plates but they were barely warm. I ordered the steak medium rare and parts of it was rare so I didn't eat it. It took a long time to flag down someone to get our dessert order. I had previously mentioned in my OpenTable reservation that we were celebrating a friend's birthday. Mastro's was very kind in bringing out a slice of chocolate cake for her with a message written on the plate. When the butter cake finally came out, it was also not very warm. We didn't finish the cake but it was still pretty delicious.\n\nMaybe this experience was an anomaly or off night, but we won't be back soon. Even if the butter cake is divine."

There were maybe three to four other tables occupied but other than that there was plenty of good seating available.  \n\nSpeaking of seating, I found the set up a little off-putting...we were seated at a two person table that butted directly against the back of a circular seating arrangement, which just so happened to contain 3-4 lovely active young children on this day.  Somehow your ability to enjoy a nice meal is a bit inhibited with a 5 year old staring at you from 1.5 feet away.  Perhaps it was our fault for not requesting one of the 50 odd other empty tables.\n\nAs other yelpsters have stated it is also a bit weird to be enjoying a $$$$ meal with Miley Cyrus cranking in the background due to the open seating overlooking/hearing the mall like Crystal Shops.  Enough nit picking though, on to the food!\n\nOur server was very attentive and started us out promptly with ice water and tea.  Micro demerit for including a lemon in my iced tea after asking to hold the lemon, but no big deal.  Huge stars go out to the staff for keeping the beverages brimming full, a frequent problem for such an iced tea addict as myself.  The bread service came with enough to feed a small army.  Mini-loaves of sourdough, pretzel, bruschetta, and French.  \n\nWe ordered the Calamari ($15).  There was plenty for the two of us, lightly breaded and including a lemon side and a dipping sauce very similar to the Outback sauce you get with bloomin onions.  \n\nTaking the \"go big or go home\" philosophy I decided to order the twin lobster tails ($69) AND 22 oz Ribeye ($55) for my entree.  My girlfriend ordered the sea bass ($50) and we split a side of lobster mashed potatoes ($38).  \n\nThe steak was wonderfully charred, cooked medium.   The server was nice enough to \"de-shell\" the lobster tails.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious with melted butter.  The sea bass was also excellent.  I let my date enjoy the majority of the potatoes as they were a bit soupy due to the sauce but the small portion I had did taste good.  \n\nWe got the butter cake to go, not sure on the price, it came complete with detailed instructions on how to best prepare it from our server.  Final bill with tip $325."

And as for pricing, it's actually pretty fair as you get a ton of great service, and most importantly, great food.  \n\nThe steak would be the only thing I get to be a snob about.  For instance, the meat was a little tough and although they've caramelized it, I can't but imagine thinking of how similar it tastes to Ruth's Cris.  But luckily, the other sides gave it supreme justice.\n\nI got the bone in rib eye, at medium rare, so it should have been tender, but somehow wasn't.  The flavor was just buttery and I just wish there was more.  \nJust to make things interesting, I turf'd it up with combination of jumbo shrimp scampi.  The amazing garlic sweltering sauce which had a parmesean bread crisp  reside next to made all the difference in the meal as the big shrimps were engulfed with flavor from the buttery garlic sauce.  \n\nFor sides, we shared the following:\n-Roasted Brussel Sprouts - pretty basic, but satisfying\n-Cream of Spinach - so damn heavy and big its a good thing we only limited ourselves to 2 sides only on top of our surfs.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal, but would I come back?

Asparagus was whatever, mushrooms were tasty, steak was perfect , lobster was too salty and not really fresh. Same with the bisque, it had a slight fishy odor. Lots of lobster and the flavor was good just not FRESH. Again, it's the desert so what did I expect? This was my first Mastro's experience, and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't too impressed.

It's a very busy place; so do reserve a table ahead of time.\n\nOur server was very nice and professional. We ordered soups for starters, my girlfriend ordered clam chowder and I ordered the lobster bisque, both soups were delicious, especially the lobster bisque. Lobster bisque was cream and not too sweet and as an added bonus there were big piece of delicious lobster meat. \n\nAfter we were done with both soups we both ordered filet mignon. I went with 12 OZ. medium rare cut while my girlfriend went with 8 OZ. well done cut (sacrilege!!!). We also ordered creamed spinach, baked potatoes with cheese and saut\u00e9ed asparagus. After a 20-25 minute wait we were served our delicious meal. The steak was exquisite, the seasoning was perfect and the meat was like butter. It melted in our mouth. The sides were also delicious, creamed spinach in particular complimented the steak well.  The only complaint of mine was that the baked potato had too much cheese on it, but everything else was amazing. \n\nI think this is best steak house I've been to in Las Vegas and if you are on the strip, then this is the place to go."

The place was pretty quiet then and around 6:30, more people started to come by so we definitely beat the dinner rush. Got a nice seat in the treehouse, with a view overlooking the Dior store downstairs.\n\nSince we didn't want to be food comatose for our show later, we ordered just the petite filet, the regular filet, and a side of scalloped potatoes. I also ordered Coke, but beware that it's by the aluminum bottle and not with unlimited refills. The scalloped potatoes were rich and delicious, but the cheese was too much halfway through the side order. The meat was very tender and cooked to perfection. The medium was medium and the medium rare was just as it should be. Since it was our anniversary, they also brought by a complimentary slice of rich chocolate cake topped with raspberries and whipped cream. Overall a fantastic meal!"

But the only complaint I have is that either the waiters or the kitchen staff make a lot of mistakes with the steaks... It's either kinda undercooked or overcooked. I asked for a medium rare plus and they gave me a rare. They comped the steak because it was their error but it was just a shame I couldn't enjoy my steak. The butter cake there is amazing!! It's a must try for all!"

Make sure to ask for a seat in the bird-nest!! \n\nFood - BEST BEST BEST Lamb racks ever!!! Ugh I had it medium rare but it came out more rare but I didn't mind. Ever bite taste like butter. Boy friend has the New York Steak - This wasn't so bad, I couldn't stop thinking about how good my lamb racks were that I can't remember if this was super good or not hahaha. We had a side of Mac and Cheese too greasy, would not order this I think we prefer the Lobster Mash potatoes instead. \n\nService was wonderful! Better service than we had in Orange County. Everyone was nice, and even the manager came to ask if everything was fine. \n\nIn the end of the meal our server ask if we wanted any dessert but we were super full for any. But he still came out and surprise me with a birthday cake! He even wrote \" Happy 21st birthday. \" Which I think is very special to me!  \n\nTHANK YOU MASTRO'S LAS VEGAS!"

Mastros Ocean Club was even better than the high bar that the Chicago location set. Aside from world class food, Tanya and Juan, who waited on me, were the absolute best servers I have ever had. They know the restaurant food very well and its almost amazing how they know almost every ingredient used in every dish. They also gave me great recommendations for the rest of my time in Vegas and were just overall great servers. Not only does Mastros have some of the best quality food around, and the ambiance is second to none, but Tanya and Juan made it such a great time that I can not wait to see them again this upcoming February! No matter what you will love Mastros but if they are working, make sure you sit with Juan and Tanya for a truly exceptional dining experience!!!"

            "review": "**This review is for the bar area only**\n\nI've heard many great things about this restaurant, and after reading other Yelp reviews I decided what better time to try this place out than my birthday? And what better way than sitting at the bar, and partaking of some artistically created adult beverages?\n\nFor starters this place is located smack in the middle of the Crystals Mall, you can't miss it. It's the big wooden orb shaped thing that seams to be floating in the center of all the action. It's pretty neat, but as other reviews mentioned, I'm not sure I'd want to spend $200+ on a dinner with a mall atmosphere. None the less it's quite a unique experience and they did a great job (at least in the bar area) of making sure their music drowned out most of the mall sounds.\n\nI knew the drinks here would be pricey so I was prepared for it, but for others it may be a shocker. They have an extensive list of specialty drinks starting at $16, but most are $18. I was told their in-house specialty was a lemon drop which came over dry ice, I didn't actually try it though. I did try the Chocolate Martini ($18)- which won me over because of the giant chocolate covered strawberry on the side of the glass. It truly was dessert in a martini glass! Other views were correct, when you order a martini they give you the shaker along with your drink so you can refill your glass, it's almost like 2 drinks in 1. I also tried the Banana Foster ($18), it was delicious but not what I expected. It has whipped cream, I expected it on top but it was shaken inside and gave the drink a bit of a lumpy texture.\n\nThe bf tried the Mastro's Mojito (also $18) and it honestly was not very good, it  came served in a tall glass so there was no shaker on the side. I wouldn't recommend ordering this one. His mom tried the Dragon Fire ($18), which as very tasty, but yes it was hot/spicy - not something to quench your thirst. She rounded off her evening with the Flur de Blu ($18), one I was considering as well. She liked it, but after I tried it I was glad I went with the dessert-style drinks instead.\n\nThe service was good. The bar wasn't busy so we had as much attention as we wanted. We were able to watch them make our drinks and that was a fun part of the experience. We saw all kinds of great food coming out of the kitchen so we asked for a food menu, we elected not to order anything since we'd already been there a while and run up a tab of $100. However one bar tender offered to bring us a bread basket. The bread was great and the basket came with several different types of bread, and super soft butter. Note to self for next time: ask for the bread basket when you arrive, it's free.\n\nI think I'll drop in some time again, when I'm in the mood for a dessert martini and can afford the $18 drinks."

I got a Spicy Mambo Salad and would probably skip it next time, only because it's just a caesar salad, sans croutons with a hint of wasabi. Kinda boring, but not worth losing a star over. Sweet potato fries are bomb, as are the mac & cheese and mashed sweet potatoes. DO NOT SKIP THE BUTTER CAKE. Thank me later."

There was 9 of us for dinner for a friend's birthday, our table was ready and waiting for us when we arrived, they allowed us to decorate the table, the service was awesome, their menu includes steak & seafood so everyone could order whatever they wanted.  The restaurant was very busy I must say and every table had cocktails on it, both are good signs for me.\n\nThey have tons of steaks to choose from, lamb, vanilla fried lobster, scallops, and tons of fish. My only confusion came from how the fish was actually prepared b/c there wasn't really on the menu explaining how you can get your fish cooked. After asking the waitress, she explained the 5 fish preparations.\n\nHere's what we ate:\n1) Sashimi tower -white fish, Tuna, lobster rolls all very good [see pix]\n2) Heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad-very tasty and tons to share\n3) Escargot-my favorite very very good [see pix]\n4) Creamed Corn-typically not a fan but I did enjoy this very much\n5) Brussels Sprouts-eh they are good for you\n6) Mac n blue cheese-yes for sure\n7) Halibut Oreganata - almost $50, but was a huge piece of fish, definitely could share this\n8) the fried lobster was another one of my favorites\n9) tuna tostadas again very good [see pix]\n\nI wanted to try the crab cake but didn't have any room left. We had more leftovers in bags then arms to carry them on.\n\nOther notable notes: waiters were exceptional with their service of our table, my glass of Veuve was never empty and the waiter was calling me by name the whole time :).\nOur bill was over a grand after everything was said and done.

Well, they were not joking.  Had an absolutely fabulous dinner,  We both ordered the Bone in Fillet, melted in my mouth, this was the most Delicious steak I have ever had.  Ordered the side of cream corn, which we shared, excellent once again.  The ending was the best, as it was our anniversary, Michael our waiter( he was awesome!) brought us Mastros signature butter cake, to die for!!  The service was suburb, from the hostess who sat us, to our awesome waiter.  We will definitely be back (soon I hope!)"

            "review": "I decided on this place for my boyfriends birthday because he loves steak and I love seafood. He tried to convince me to go somewhere cheaper but I wouldnt allow it. At first I was not a fan of our server- took about 15 minutes to get menu's and an introduction. I think he heard me bitching about it because after that he went out of his way to attend to us. He was an odd fellow but he was trying very hard. I am a sucker for expensive glasses of wine and love it when a restaurant offers such- The server gave a very on point description of the wine I ordered. For entree I had the sea bass and my boyfriend had steak- something with a bone in it- I guess the rib eye? Im not sure about that as I dont eat beef...I was loving my sea bass until my darling mentioned that his steak was extremely salty...and in that moment I noticed that mine was also extremely salty...and I LOVE salt. The sea bass was cooked to perfection and was so flaky and delicious with just the perfect amount of crust on the outside. But- it was almost too salty to eat. My boyfriend said the same thing about the steak- that it was perfectly cooked and a great piece of meat but too salty to really enjoy. \n\nOverall the meal cost me an arm and at least 2 legs...Service B+, Wine A+, Entree C, Bread A+, Price for what you get C+."

Luckily, the delicious food and wine made up for the sour date.\n\nWe started with the oysters (Blue Points I think). They were fresh and delicious. We then shared the seared scallops and bone-in fillet mignon as our main dishes. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They were a bit creamy for my taste but overall a solid dish. The bone-in fillet mignon, omg, was soooo good, probably the best steak I've had in the US. The meat was tender yet full of flavor. I was in heaven and couldn't care much less about whatever Mr. Snobby was barking about. \n\nOh and we shared crab gnocchi as the side dish (with a price tag of $30, a bit steep for a side dish.) I also had a glass of Pinot Noir (ZD '09) to go with the steak - the wine didn't have enough body, but it went very well with the meat. \n\nI knocked off one star because they served the scallops and the steak at the same time in the same plate, which I really didn't like. I would prefer having them separately. The scallops should have come first and then the steak as two individual courses. This way I could have really taken my time to taste each dish. \n\nOverall, I really liked this restaurant. As for my date, I found out he wasn't all that annoying anyways. He was kinda cute and was quite thoughtful when I wasn't feeling well at the end of the meal. I may come back to the Mastro's next time I am in Vegas. Will I go out with Mr. Snobby again? I think so."

This is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. \n\nWe were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get Paul as our waiter. Paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. Knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. \n\nHe was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. I ordered the dungeness crab cocktail and the 22 oz bone-in ribeye. I love seafood and was planning on the seabass but couldnt resist the ribeye. Our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and Gnocci with alaskan king crab. \n\nThe crab cocktail was excellent. Served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. It was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). The ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. It had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. Beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. \n\nThe gorgonzola mac and creamed spinach ($14) were both really good. We were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). I found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. For dessert we ordered 3 of Mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. \n\nPaul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. The butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). They can easily be split  between two or three people. \n\nMastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. The steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved."

Our server was great and attentive, and we had to stop ourselves from eating all the fresh bread. \nWe weren't overly hungry so we shared a larger filet mignon. It was decent, but it wasn't as tender as others I've had before. The stone crab was delicious and I'd want to try their sea bass on a future visit. My bf has a sweet tooth, so we ordered sorbet for dessert. We got three of the largest scoops we've ever seen in our life! I joked for that size they should've given us one of each flavor instead of making us pick one. We only finished one scoop."

When I initially called to make the reservation I had a warm welcoming voice on the other end. \n\nUpon arriving I was a little unsure because I didn't realize it was inside the mall, I immediately didn't know what to expect. I have been to the one in Newport Beach, Scottsdale and Palm Springs, all fabulous of coarse. \n\nHostess looked well groomed, acted professional and was very inviting and seemed happy to have us dine. \n\nServer Lionel was Amazing, Made great dinner suggestions. I had the Strawberry Mule to drink, Bone In Filet for dinner, My husband had the Lobster and we shared scallop potaoes and sauted asparagus. ( All sides are ala carte and are shareable for the table) \n\nOnly downfall was there was a problem with the scallop potatoes, within seconds a manager by the name of Brandon was there, took it away and offered garlic mash potatoes in place , until new ones were ready. Nice recovery, and made the situation forgotten. When the new ones came it was PERFECT!\n\nAt the end of our meal our server Lionel and Manager Brandon came by again and apologized for the mishap and brought us a complimentary dessert which is there signature dessert, The Warm Butter Cake. All I can say is OMG!!! Best thing ever. \n\nIt was a beautiful experience, Great food, service and atmosphere. Food was spaced out and timed perfectly. Excellent job chefs! I am defiantly going back next time we go to LV. \n\nA restaurant that runs this smoothly from back of the house to front is all from great leadership.

Everything from the wait staff, ambiance and the food are all beyond amazing. \n\nTheir service is probably as good as it gets. The hostesses are all very friendly in their greetings when you arrive. The wait staff is very attentive. I felt like I never had to flag someone down, there was always someone readily available. \n\nThe energy in the restaurant is very nice. There was live music being played on a piano which helped to set the tone. The restaurant itself is set up in a modern tree house space located inside of the Crystal's shopping center. There is nice colorful lighting that helps set off the dark woods of the tree house and white table cloths of Mastro's.\n\nThe food though is the real star of the show. I had the 12oz filet and it was phenomenal. It was cooked exactly the way I like it. Perfectly seasoned. The other member of my party had the bone in rib eye which was just massive. The sides we ordered were more than enough to share. The side portions are a meal in themselves. Their mac & cheese is a must have! So are their sea salt & vinegar fries. If possible, save room for dessert. Their signature butter cake is by far one of the best desserts that I have ever had on the Las Vegas strip. I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary cake from the manager, so if I could, they would get an extra bonus star just for that.\n\nAll in all, Mastro's is a definite must visit. It's great for special occasions or even business dinners. It will become one of your new standards for what you expect in a restaurant."

Both were busy with other, more important things I suppose.\n\nBut then, finally, attention was given.  They couldn't locate my reservation, and then finally found it to let me know it was the next night, not the night I arrived.  I was noticeably upset, as I had even received an email from OpenTable to confirm my reservation.  (I guess it was an OpenTable error somehow though... and have since had other OT issues).\n\nFortunately, they were accommodating in squeezing me and my boyfriend in on a busy Friday night. We got a great spot even - but then I suppose not many seats at this small restaurant wouldn't have a nice \"view\".   You're in a bird cage overlooking all of the shoppers!\n\nThroughout the entire meal, attention was not lacking.  You're pretty much pampered here, and every.single.associate is ON IT.  \n\nAre you about to take a picture of your group? Not without assistance from a waiter.  \n\nHad more than a few sips of water?  It'll be refilled practically instantaneously.\n\nSo, the service once seated was impeccable. \n\nDrinks - very reasonable for vegas, and they do it right. No dilution here.\n\nFood:\n\nComplimentary Bread:  Well, I had already known just how good their pretzel bread was from former visits in the O.C., and while the Las Vegas pretzel bread was slightly harder, it was still delicious.\n\nMushrooms:  Infused with something magical.  Seriously, savored every single bite of these. Hands down, the greatest mushrooms that have ever met my taste buds.\n\nMac & Cheese:  Ridiculously cheesy.  Cheese with pasta, with more cheese, with a blanket of cheese melted on top of it.  And surprisingly good as a left over too.  \n\nSteak:  Filet Mignon.... no sauce needed, no seasoning needed.  The cut of meat was flawless and perfectly tender.  \n\nDessert:  I did say I was saving the best for last, and this was it.  Butter cake, all the way. Moist cake accompanied with vanilla ice cream... sounds traditional but they've got a recipe that will leave every bite ending with Oohs and Aaahs.  The house-made whipped cream came in a massive pile, and then some."

Service was horrible. Food was barely mediocre. I wouldn't recommend this abomination of a restaurant to anyone. I am usually pretty easygoing. I can't even remember the last time I even complained about a meal. Our reservation was at 10:00pm.  We sat in the bar and had drinks until our table was ready at 10:30. We sat down and our server took our drink order while we looked over the menus. The drinks came in short order and then the fun began. We ordered several appetizers, salads and our main courses. The appetizers included tuna so our server told us that he would bring those first since they came out quickly and he wanted them to be fresh for us. They did come out first. About a half hour later. An hour into our meal we were still waiting for our salads. Our server was off working the cash register. I couldn't get his attention so I got up and went over and asked when our salads would arrive. He looked at me like I had two heads and said he didn't know we wanted them out so quickly after our appetizers. Mind you we were now over an hour into our meal and had long since eaten the appetizers which were so so. They finally showed up a half hour later. I got up again and asked to speak to the general manager. The server told me it was all his fault but I insisted on speaking to the person in charge. Eventually someone came up who introduced himself as the assistant manager. He apologized profusely, told us that section of the dining room was running slow and what could he do to help. I said please send out our meals. He looked at me quizically and asked if I really wanted my food to come out right away since we still seemed to be into our salads. I said yes just bring the food. He said right away. A half hour later our meals had not yet arrived. I found our server and told him that most of us had lost out appetites since we were so upset with the service. We wanted to cancel our food. All except the birthday boy who still wanted his steak dinner. It finally came out. He had ordered it medium. It was charred nicely on the outside but when he cut into it, it was so raw I swear I saw the slab of meat start to squirm. We had to send it back. It came back and was cooked to the right temperature. My son took a bite and said it was OK. Some tried a bite and agreed it was very mediocre. He finished and we left. The impression we left with was that they thought we made far too much of our service. In fact we had assumed that the reason the assistant manager came over was that the general manager was not working that night. Not true. She was the woman with the walkie talkie hovering about in the background we later found out. She never once came over and and seemed to have no interest in trying to help us out. Please people, if you have any compassion, boycott Mastros. HORRIBLE!!!"

I am spoiled by Seattle's seafood so I have high expectations. Yes. The crab is good. Cold and refreshing. However for $25 dollars I rather have tried something else as I can get much more up north. However it was good. \nSteak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. I think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. Medium rare. It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! \nSeafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the \"arreganato\" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. \nSides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. Omg this is soooo good. The truffle oil just perfected it. Best gnocchi ever!!\nLobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) I am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides. \nDidnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake.

The portions are perfect ..but we got full after the steamed mussels so had to take the rest 'to go' ...\nAlso, if u have a special occasion, make sure u tell them ahead as they will get u a super nice piece of cake for u.. ON THE HOUSE.\nAll this deliciousness didn't cost more than $180 .. \nThank u for another pleasant experience Mastro's ..see you soon!"

We had seen the strange bird house looking structure at Crystals many times before. We made a reservation for a table in the birdhouse although there are a lot of tables in the other sections of the restaurant. We were promptly seated and service started immediately. We ordered the vanilla battered shrimp as an appetizer. My wife ordered the lobster bisque which we shared. She ordered Parmesan crusted grouper. I ordered Blackened Chilean Sea Bass. For sides we ordered creamed spinach and sea salt and vinegar fries. My wife liked the shrimp, I was disappointed in it. It was very lightly tempura battered, very tender. I just thought it was bland. The lobster bisque was everything we had hoped for and more. It was thick and creamy with large pieces of lobster; very savory. The Parmesan crusted grouper was excellent. It was perfectly cooked and lightly spiced. The Sea Bass was perfect. It was very thick, light and flaky. The creamed spinach was excellent. The salt and vinegar fries were good. They are very thinly sliced (think potato sticks). But the best was still to come. We ordered their signature warm butter cake. OMG this may be the best cake either of us has ever eaten. It is served with a garnish of fresh fruit, a huge scoop of ice cream and fresh whipped cream. Regardless of what else you order here, you MUST try this warm butter cake. Service was excellent and she the price is fair. \n\nMinuses- the noise level is very high. Very hard to hold a conversation. They have a large staff of servers, but service was slow. One of our sides was delivered as we finished our entre's. \n\nWe will definitely be back."

So they tried to put us at a table, that was so close to the other table, that the people eating would have to get up so would be able to sit. I had taken the day off from work, this was my birthday dinner, that I never got to have. We left do to the fact we didn't want to interrupt the other people from eating. The bottom line is that if you want a great meal and great service, go to the Wynn. I usually go there, but I thought I would try something new, big mistake."

By far my favorite part was the sea food tower, build it anyway you like, everything on there was so fresh I could hear waves crashing.  My steak was cooked exactly how I like it, and the wine flight pairing made for a nice compliment.  Only down side was because our party was somewhat large, and there was at least one other large party service was a little sparse and at one point we waited 15 min for someone to come around.  This is the only reason Maestros gets a 4 out of 5 in my book, however I will return as the food was just that good."

It was like a one night stand you want to call you again. Real classy joint. The whole family went to Vegas for Christmas. Since we are Jews, we decided to forego the stereotypical Chinese food and step it up a bit.  We were looking for a nice steakhouse and we were torn between Craft Steak or Maestros- Since we were staying at Vdara, Maestro's was closer.  Thank goodness- hands down best steak I've ever had. Even my picky eater girls loved it. I had the filet- melted in my mouth like butter.  We ordered the mussels, crab claws, bone marrow, salmon, broccoli, sweet potato fries, spinach- I don't normally eat seafood but I was so stuffed and satisfied when I left- I'll let you make the one night stand joke this time.

We were seated in the half booth half tables that are right next to the bar. You know, the ones that are right on top of each other. I was annoyed, because I would think they would save these seats for walk-ins. I was determined to not let that upset me and I'm so happy I didn't. Our waiter was awesome as was our food. They bring this beautiful bread basket with a variety of wonderful fresh bread, served with butter of course. \nWe started with the colossal Dungeness crab which came out with dry ice so it was smoking. It was pretty neat. The crab was very fresh.  I drank water, but my ordered a double shot crown and coke. There was so much crown when the waiter brought the drink that he couldn't put but a splash of coke in it (sodas come in little aluminum bottles). I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband ordered the 12oz filet. We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My sea bass was cooked to perfection and it was huge, I couldn't even finish it.  My husband's filet was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a soft garlic flavor. They were my husband's favorite. The mushrooms were saut\u00e9ed with rosemary. I've never had mushrooms with rosemary. It was a new flavor for me and I liked it. Our waiter brought us the butter cake for dessert complimentary for dining with them. This was my favorite. It came with a ginormous side of homemade whipped cream. It was the greatest, most delicious thing I've had. I've been dreaming about it ever since! I love this restaurant and have told all my friends and family about it. Definitely going back!"

All the food was just blah, not bad, but not what you expect for the price. Fried calamari had too little seasoning for me. Seared ahi tuna was pretty tasty I will say, but there was like 4 thin pieces not much to eat. Spicy mambo salad was basically like ceasar salad. Seafood tower was decent and included raw oysters, lobster, crab...the basics. I was going to take pictures, actually I tried, but as I said place was nightime dark in there.

So since we were in Vegas, we decided to give Mastros Ocean Club a try.  We were not disappointed.  The restaurant is located in the City Center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky d\u00e9cor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  The d\u00e9cor is simple contemporary.  It would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  If you visit Mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  They also have a lounge singer and piano player.  The volume was fine (as I've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so I can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  Regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  Now to the important part - the food.  Everything we ordered was amazing.  As all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  Our entrees were delishous - ahi tuna, sea bass, and scallops.  I have no complaints, all were cooked PERFECTLY and extremely flavorful.  The portions were quite large.  The sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  One of the sides - the mac and cheese was AH. MAZ. ING.  If we're ever back I'd be happy to dive into the Lobster mashed potatoes.  The wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  I had the lobster bisque which was very tasty.  I've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. And there were big chunks of lobster.  Service, supurb as expected.  The menu is pricey, but worth it.  I'll definitely be checking out Mastros in Chicago."

Fresh, juicy, and the size of a mini lobster! The Kumato oysters were fresh, but sandy. I wish we would have tried the crab or lobster instead. \nThe steak was good, but had parts that were more heavily seasoned than others. It was still tasty, but I felt Ruth's Chris does a better steak. The mac and cheese was mediocre and could be skipped next time. The asparagus was fresh, but the tips weren't cooked. I did like that they serve the sides for you.\nThe berry dream cocktail was to die for! It was strong, but didn't have the strong alcohol taste and the server shakes it up table side and leaves you the remains in the shaker. Definite plus!\nFor dessert, they brought out the chocolate cake for our anniversary celebration. It was overly sweet and a bit dry. I really wanted to try the butter cake so we ordered one of those too. Very decadent and delicious. I enjoyed the slightly crisp edges and soft, warm center with the ice cream. \nOverall, this was a good experience. We would come back the next time and try more of the seafood."

Our table felt like a satellite location for a sparkling contemporary version of daddy's classic steak house. And we weren't even seated in the satellite (you'll get it if you visit). It just seemed surreal for a \"room\" with such distinguishing attributes. I won't hold that against them, much.\n\nIt was just my son and I that visited to celebrate his 21st. Matt was our dining guide and he was fun. Not like, \"let's have a Vegas night!\", fun. Just that he carried his demeanor well and kept his smile on. He was very, very consistent in that his presentation to each of the three tables nearby was identical, and specific. He was meticulous to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.\n\nWe were completely impressed by the young lady and gentleman entertaining the room. We later learned that it was their first night at Mastro's. Their acoustics in that challenging environment are absolute perfection and their talents are superior.  \n\nWe went light on the openers which were supplemented by an abundant variety of stellar bread choices. My son is All-American in his need for a Calamari appetizer. It was the best we'd ever had, and maybe will. I had the Ocean Club Salad and, again, maybe the best complete salad I've ever enjoyed. My son ordered the Bone-In KC Strip a little less than medium and he dubbed it The Crown Jewel of his steak experiences. He couldn't finish it and he finishes everything. I asked for the Bone-In Ribeye. Matt helped me herd descriptives into a perfectly cooked finish. I'm still thinking it's the fact that I live in Colorado, where even onions and garlic sometimes have difficulty offering flavor, but if it's possible to have too much natural flavor in a steak, it happened. I'm taking accountability on that one, because it's not Mastro's fault I live at high altitude. This was a huge steak and I hardly dented it. We sided up a strong contender for best garlic mashed, which we carried out more of than we ate. So we get this this lovely shopping bag, consistent with the elevated neighborhood, to carry our midnight snack down the strip with. \n\nI have so many reasons to go 5 star all over this place and fractions of thoughts about why I wouldn't. Those fractions, the bulk of which are carried by the food court railing ambiance, add up to one. And I won't insult Matt because I liked him.\n\nWhen I return in May, I might just take the other half of the family because I can't go wrong on this one."

But I wanted to try something new and by far, this was the best reviewed spot. Only thing that turned me off was that it was in the middle of a mall. NOT AN ISSUE. I requested the 'Tree House' and that is where we were sat. Once in there I completely forgot I was in a mall...it was romantic and beautiful. Our server greeted us and asked if we've ever diner here before....we both responded \"NO\". We were then treated to a 5 minute explanation of their entire menu. Based on other reviews...we started with the shrimp cocktail and I suggest you do the same. Very unique and brilliant presentation. My gf had the Fillet of Arctic Char \"Oreganata\"..we both LOVED it. I had the Bone In Rib-Eye. Cooked perfectly. Delicious. For sides we chose the mac-n-cheese(not bad, but kinda bland to what I've had at comparable restaurants) and the brussel sprouts...fantastic. We had no room for dessert. Cocktails were good....coming from a guy in that business. As we left, EVERYONE thanked us for coming...from busser to manager. That was impressive. I even woke up the next morning to a voicemail from them thanking me for me business and hoping that me and my 'beautiful' gf had a great time; and that they hope to see us again. ONLY complaint..and this is being picky: when our bread was dropped off(with multiple choices), it was just thrown down with no explanation as to what was what. But this is a must go!"

The locations of the handful of Mastro's that exist live in high end cities like Scottsdale, AZ, Beverly Hills, CA and Chicago, IL.  This location in Las Vegas was tagged with the words \"Ocean Club\" to show off the fact that not only do they have steak but a large selection of seafood too.\n\nSteak is what Mastro's have built themselves up as and if you are thinking about dining here I would suggest the steak.  They are famous for firing their meats in an oven that burns hotter than 1100 degrees F.  I ordered the bone in ribeye that I split with my friend.  We did the usual recommendation of medium rare and in my opinion it came out perfect, though it was too bloody for her and she sent hers back to be cooked more.  \n\nOf course Mastro's is a la carte and buyer beware the sides are HUGE.  One side order can be spit by 3 people.  We ordered the grilled brussel sprouts and they brought them out piping hot still in the skillet and put the skillet on the table.  \n\nWine selection is wonderful.  Though the food is pricey the wine prices are affordable with decent bottles for only $27 though they go way up in price.\n\nDessert was a chef's creation at this Mastro's in Vegas (executive chef Wayne Schumaker) which is the signature warm butter cake.  This is a large piece of butter cake that has a sugar crust that is baked hot along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a pile of homemade whipped cream.  OMG ridiculous good but again could be shared with like, 5 people.  \n\nThe only major downside to Mastro's is the music.  They have a live piano bar that you think would play soft, classy music like jazz or piano but instead you get very loud, karaoke type performances by an older man and woman (ages 60+) who use an iPad connected to the piano to sing modern and past day pop music such as Pink, Katy Perry, and even Foster the People's \"Pumped Up Kicks\".  If Mastro's would lose the cheesy, loud, awful music they would go to 5 stars.  \n\nBring headphones and enjoy a nice dinner."

And for sides we did the \"Lobster mashed, Cream corn & Sauted mushrooms\". Both steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. \"Seriously best steak I've ever had in my life\"... those were the boyfriends words since this was my first time in over a year eating red meat. But I have to agree with him. The lobster mashed potatoes were so creamy and buttery. Cream of corn was very tasty, almost reminded me of the mexican corn with out all the cheese. The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were also very delicious. Very happy with the entrees and sides we got. I fell in love with all of them.\n\nLas but not least, DESSERT!. \nWaiter brought us out a chocolate piece of cake with fresh whipped cream. I did not care so much for this cake as it was a little on the dry side for me but eh it was complimentary for our Anniversary. I knew I had to order the famous Butter Cake so I did. The butter cake came out super warm with a big scoop of ice cream on top. Okay so this cake was good but I feel like I've had better dessert. I hate salt on any dessert so this was a huge downfall for me. Cake tasted like a very sweet, buttery corn bread. I don't know how to make out of this cake but if I go back I probably won't order it again. Yes I know very sad as everyone literally worships this cake. Over all I had a great experience and I cannot wait to go back again. I think this is my new favorite steak house."

There's a nice variety of steaks and seafood, and the ambiance is quiet and fantastic. It's not too trendy or loud, and the food is classic and well prepared. The tree house area is especially nice. \n\nWe tried a bit of everything, and all of it was fantastic. The cold seafood tower appetizer was fantastic (the stone crab claws were the stand out!). For our entrees most of us got seafood and were all pleased! I loved my arctic char, although it was HUGE - stupid HUGE. Honestly it seemed like 16-20 ounces of freaking fish on my plate. With all the other yummy food floating around I could barely polish off a quarter of my fish. If I was dining with my husband, this is definitely a dish we could share. The best side with the crab and black truffle gnocchi... OMG.. best gnocchi of my life ! The lobster mashed potatoes were pretty incredible as well. \n\nSo the butter cake did live up to the hype! Moist, rich, delicious. Four of us split this and felt like there was more than enough to go around. Even if you don't think you have room for dessert - this cake is good enough to warrant making yourself sick !\n\nI can't say I tried any meat, but for seafood I really loved this place. Great service, and great food."

Set the mood very well for our dinner. We checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly. \n\nWe sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. They played really good music ranging from older American pop songs to older R&B songs with their own twist. I couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n1. lobster mashed potatoes - this was the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. They really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! The meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. If you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster. \n\n2. Sauteed Asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies. \n\n3. Petite Filet Mignon - usually I like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and I don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. However this steak was so tender and cooked just right. I enjoyed it a lot. It was just the right portion, 8 oz, since I wasn't too hungry.\n\n3. Sea Scallops - I had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!\n\nDefinitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!"

            "review": "My girlfriend and I took a whole week vacation off to visit the West coast. It was our first time trip to visit Las Vegas, and the entire experience was amazing and unforgettable. Amid the many alluring performing shows, the endless eyes-dazing slot machines, and the gigantic resorts were some of the most fantastic restaurants that Vegas could offer. \n\nWe first passed by OC while exploring the riches on the famed Strip. It was located within the beautiful Crystal. Upon seeing it, both of us were intrigued by the outstanding artistry presented by the original designer. The structure's frames were made out of steel and covered with fine, deep red wood. Between the frames were giant crystal clear glasses that allowed a perfect view from both within and out. However, the most salient and attracting feature was that the entire structure was slanted. My words would be lacking and limited for the description, but just imagine an hourglass tilted like a forward-slash sign. Bemused by its charm, we booked a table on a Monday night and dressed in proper attires, girlfriend in a beautiful orange-red dress.\n\nWe arrived around 10pm after seeing the fantastic Le Reve at Wynn. Being Monday night, the restaurant had only a few tables occupied. We were given a table near the crystal glasses, which allowed an excellent view for the outside. Our waitress of the night was very friendly and polite. As she went slowly on explaining the menu she also told us that the structure was called \"The Tree\", its name inspired by the tiny leaves spurting out of the joints of the steel frames. From the menu, we picked \"Dungeness Crab Cocktail\" and \"Vanilla Batter Shrimp\" for appetizers, a \"Fillet of Arctic Char Oreganate\" with \"Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi\" as entree and side dish. The crab cocktail came in a special tall glass container filled with mist giving dry ice. Each large lumps of crab meat was tender and fresh with the saltiness and sweetness of the ocean. The vanilla fried shrimps were gigantic in size, each crispy on the outside and tender within, a must try for shrimp lovers. The arctic char was perfect, cooked to medium-rare the way I loved. It was a huge fillet more than enough for the two of us to share. The Oreganate style was foreign to me, but the combination of butter, spices, and bread crumbs had made a wonderful sauce suited well with the fish. The gnocchi was huge in portion, baked in large hot skillet and filled with delicious cheese and crab meat. The mix of crab meat, cheese, and truffle gave the dish an unique and saliva dripping aroma. However, due to the large portion, over-stuffing this huge amount of cheese, crab meat and gnocchi is not recommended. You would need to trust me on this, as the first 5 bites would have you mouthwatering for more, but double that you would start having the too-much-cream-stuck-in-your-stomach feeling, and beyond that would be just too much to handle.  Alas, at the end, gf and I had to pick out the delicious crab meat along with the truffle to eat and wasted a large amount of the gnocchi.\n\nRegrettably, since we were on a tight schedule for a night club to visit, we skipped the desserts - What a shame! Dinning at Ocean Club was such a wonderful experience. My gf and I enjoyed every minute from beginning to end. Yes, it was a very expensive place, but so was everything else in Vegas and every penny spend was well worth it. So by chance if you ever stop by Vegas, be sure to checkout this amazing restaurant."

The ambiance is set well, the architecture is particularly astounding, and the service is exquisite. Our server, Joe, was on his game. My water glass and wine glass never reached half empty (or half full). Ordered the Bone Marrow, Lobster Bisque, Ocean Club Crab Cakes, Sauteed Broccoli, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese, 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, and Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake. \n\nBone Marrow - Holy Donkey Punching Jesus this is astounding. I have never had Bone Marrow before but its alluring presence on the menu was enough for me to sample it. The Bone Marrow comes half charred on a split bone with a serving of toasted baguette to spread on. The flavor, the texture, the taste and everything about it was amazing. I will order this every time and you should as well.\n\nOcean Club Crab Cakes - Hearty crab cakes with more crab than cake. In fact the cakes fall apart to the softest touch, the chunks of crab meat separating with ease as only a minimal amount of filler has been used. Flavor and spice is more than enough to accent the cakes.\n\nLobster Bisque - Oftentimes Lobster Bisque comes heavily buttered, even in the most finest of dining establishment. Butter is an easy thing to add to a dish to increase its flavor without actually improving on its originality and substance. However, Mastro's Lobster Bisque does not perpetuate this and, rather, has a full-bodied bisque with a generous portion of lobster inside. The thickness is akin to how a bisque should be.\n\nSauteed Broccoli - Opting to go a slightly healthier route with one of the dishes I was still impressed but of course, it's sauteed broccoli, and only so much can be done while keeping it true.\n\nGorgonzola Mac and Cheese - a perfect compliment to my Bone-in Ribeye and a hearty side at that. It's a shame our hotel fridge has a monitored scale with a restocking fee otherwise I would have had no issue taking the remainder of this with me.\n\n22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye - One of the finer Ribeyes I have had. A generous amount of fat and it was seared and salted well enough to make it exceedingly juicy. Cooked to perfection (rare) with a cool red center while the black crust of searing on iron was still present. \n\nMastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake - Fuck. That's Amazing.\n\nThe servings sizes of sides are plentiful and the prices are what you'd expect at such an establishment. Be wary of those giving Mastro's a bad review due to price or service, such an establishment would be careful to hire only proven servers and I would wager that the reviewers themselves to be the standoffish party."

This was my first time visiting Mastro's and I had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so I was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place. \n\nWe made our selections from a pre-set menu.\n\nMy first course I went with the Caeser Salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of Caeser. \n\nFor my entree I chose the 8oz filet. I asked for it to be prepared medium. What came out was between rare and tartare. Since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, I didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and I didn't want to interupt the lecturer. I ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.\n\nThe family style shared sides weren't impressive either. Mashed potatoes had no flavor, and the sugar snap peas as well. Only one I liked was the creamed spinach. \n\nDessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. I went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which I thought was better than the cake itself. \n\nPretty disappointing meal all together. I would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. I definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner."

Not sure what that's all about.  \n\nService was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  Everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  We were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. \n\nFood:\nI ordered the Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese $12 and the Rack of Lamb $48.  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  I had read that this was a great side dish so I was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  The portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  It easily fed our entire table.  I asked for the Rack of Lamb medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  Regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  The outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  It came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  We also had a Heirloom Tomato and Burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  The table got the Seafood Tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  This was friggin amazing.  Honestly.  There were Kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow crab legs, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  All fresh and tender meat.  It didn't require sauce.  None of it was briny or sandy.  So delicious and whatever we paid, I don't care.  It was unbelievable. Other people in our party got the Arctic Char \"oreganato\" style, bone-in filet, seared scallops and halibut.  Every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and creamed corn (this had to have crack in it b/c creamed corn never tasted so good.)  NO ONE had a single complaint and EVERYONE finished what they ordered.  By this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the BUTTER CAKE.  If you come here, no matter what you order, you MUST save room for this signature dessert.  I can't even describe it but it is amazing.  It comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   MUST.  MUST.  MUST have.  \n\nOverall, great experience.  Cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  You do the math."

Slightly poor ambiance because it's in a mall, albeit an ultra fancy mall. The piano guy was pretty good. \n\nThe food was fantastic. Had really good oysters, ask for the grassy ones if they have them. Some sort of california oyster that had a really strong flavor that the waitress recommended. \n\nThe crab cakes and ahi tuna apps were also very good.\n\nFor main we got the seabass and the swordfish. The seabass was very good, but not in that cliched and too common sweet glazed seabass/ black cod. \n\nSwordfish I foolishly ordered a little underdone but was still good. They allow you to choose how to cook the meat, if you don't know much about cooking and different fish, ask the server, he/she seems very likely to know the best way to order each fish. \n\nFor dessert, we got their signature \"butter cake\" which was obviously ridiculously rich and good. Served with an ENORMOUS tray of whipped cream. Everything at this restaurant appears to be made from scratch, and it tastes that way too. Every dish is enormously portioned as well."

Gnocchi with Alaskan crab ,truffle oil then topped with shaved black truffle and crisped panko bread crumbs is decadent and delish! It is served sizzling and definitely  enough to share between two people. I ordered a half portion the second visit and it still was enough between the two of  us! One of the best things i have ever eaten. I am picky about gnocchi and they do it light and pillowy here with a white sauce. On to the steaks, PRIME CUT EVERYTHING! all steaks are served on 400 degree plates with clarified butter and ur choice of salt/pepper or u can request cajun blackened. Phenomonal steaks and yes I am from Texas and still say this, My favorite winery is Michael David from Lodi  ..they make the good ol 7Deadlyzins, petite petit sirah and Mastros serves their Earthquake Cab for only two times markup (51 bucks)! this is a GREAT value for Vegas . SW steakhouse in the Wynn charges an obnoxious 5x markup! - This is important if you love wine with ur steaks. I had filet mignon, tomahawk ribeye,  truffle crab gnocchi, chocolate pudding cake, gorgonzola mac and cheese, lobster roll, and oysters rockefeller this week at mastros. The gnocchi , steaks and lobster roll were NOT TO BE MISSED here. I wasnt crazy about the mac and cheese but that may be because I was totally spoiled by the gnocchi(priced at 32 full portion, 16 for half portion) . If you are budgeting however the mac is only 13 and 6.50 for a half portion. try it you will love it ! Our waiter was excellent and attentive , this place is worth the money in the big pool of steakhouses in Vegas"

Nice touch, for a server to remember a couple in the midst of the hundreds that she assists (that's attention to detail if you ask me). \n\nOur first visit we enjoyed their delicious bread basket (pretzel bread my fav), Lobster Bisque (dare I say, the best ever tasted...and that's coming from someone that grew up in Monterey with some of the best seafood anywhere), lamb (again, the best ever tasted), filet, saut\u00e9ed green beans....and topped off with their signature warm butter cake! And can't forget the smoothest and delicious Lemon Drop cocktail....love the dry ice effect! \n\nWe had another fabulous dining experience that evening for my husband's birthday just this past weekend with Craig as our server. This time we started we took it lighter and slower to enjoy.....starting with their spinach salad and decided to split the 22oz Ribeye that I had read about and recommended...they kindly split it up on 2 separate plates for us (without us asking), saut\u00e9ed asparagus.....and was topped off with a birthday cr\u00e8me brulee (my hubby's fav dessert)....I wasn't much of a brulee fan....until I tried theirs....smooth, creamy, delicious vanilla bean custard!\n\nWe won't miss a visit on our future Vegas visits...even if just to sit at the bar for appetizers, bisque, drinks and dessert!"

            "review": "Food was amazing. The discount on this review is based on the hostess service upon check in. \n\nI wanted to have dinner with my dad for his 73rd birthday. I made a reservation for 5pm for a party of two. I showed up early at 4:20pm and hostess said she could not seat us however we can sit by the bar and have drinks and appetizers. The two hostesses asked for my name multiple times for the reservation. We sat by the bar and the bartender says only non cooked items are available for appetizers. I wish the hostess mentioned this before offering the bar side option. 5pm passes by and I see the hostess seating other parties to the tables. I went back to the reception and the same hostess asked for my name twice. She points at another host and I assume to follow her. She doesn't acknowledge or provide a greeting. I realize she is the one supposed to seat is. Maybe the host station wasn't organized or wasn't ready for the evening but I didn't appreciate the confusion and cold reception upon check in. I understand names are complicated but I must have said my generic name seven times to two different people, \"Cheryl Garcia\". To add additional confusion, I received an email saying I did a 'no show' for my reservation on Open Table. I'm not certain how that happened even when I checked in on Yelp as well. \n\nThe server provided better service and made excellent recommendations. I have an issue with over ordering but that's because I want to taste everything. For a party of two, I ended up ordering the chowder, calamari, sides of roasted brussels sprouts, sauted asparagus, twice baked potato, sea salt & vinegar fries, and twelve oz bone in filet. The bread service was warm with an assorted selection. I enjoyed all the sides except the twice baked potato- I thought it was too salty & the chowder was slightly watered down and boring. The calamari was flavorful and crispy. The bone in filet was served sizzling on a ceramic platter and was super tender cooked to perfection. \n\nThe server brought out a complimentary butter cake for my Dad's birthday. The cake was warm and rich topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. This was very special and made the overall experience much better."

(I personally think that Cut has the cold, snobby vibe that I'm referring to)\n\nHighly recommend the whole dining experience, but I also love going to grab a glass of wine at the bar.  The bar has an open feeling that is very comfortable, but with an intimate vibe.\n\nFood is good.  Nicely prepared and cooked to perfection.  Nothing crazy on the menu or super unique so its an easy crowd pleaser.  \n\nPrice is on target as well for their quality of food. They don't push you to buy bottles of wine or spend a ton of money.  The servers are just there to give you what you ask for.  I never felt pressured to get more food and spend a ton. \n\nBy the way, if you're local they have a free dessert!  They're so generous with the portion size and its so delicious.  This definitely helps when I'm deciding where to go.\n\nWe love our restaurants that support their locals!"

I've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. The ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. Making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. In case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from Louis Vuitton. We had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. The hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. Once everyone was there we were seated right away. The waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. I was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the Chilean Sea Bass which I had my eye on, so I opted for the 18oz bone-in filet. I ordered mine rare of course because I feel anything above medium rare ruins the true flavor of the meat. The cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. They age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. Juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. Now for the fish, the sea bass was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. For sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. We all ordered different sides and got to share. We had brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and truffle fries. Oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. Every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. Two words, BUTTER CAKE. If you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. They also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. If you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out Mastro's, it's totally worth the money."

Almost as soon as you sit down, the waiter brings an amazing bread basket with the prize being the hot pretzel bread.  We split the bacon wedge blue cheese salad and my wife had the big eye tuna rare. It was a huge portion of incredible, slightly seared sashimi. I ordered the New York medium and it was perfect medium with no grizzle or fat.  It comes on a plate that is 400 degrees with clarified butter on the bottom. I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Sure its $50 bucks, but I've had lots of crappy 50 dollar steaks in my life and this was worth every penny.  We ordered the side dish that the waiter suggested.-home made gnocchi with either lobster or crap meat and gorgonzola cheese. Maybe the best 29 dollars I've ever spent!  We had a great bottle of merlot and unfortunately, couldn't finish all of  the food so we passed on the amazing selection of desserts but will leave room for one next time. And no, I'm not related to the owners!  Just had a fabulous meal and want to share our experience!!"

I think this is the best steak I've ever had.  Everything is cooked to perfection. We had the spicy mambo salad which was a twist on a traditional caesar with wasabi and sriracha dressing (order with croutons added back on).  We also had the shrimp cocktail which was coincidentally one of the best shrimp cocktails I've ever had too.  The dry ice makes it that much more fun.  I think Mastro's has one of the best bread baskets in town as well, particularly the pretzel bread.  It makes it so you almost don't even need sides -- however, if you are getting sides, you must try the lobster mashed potatoes at least once in your life!  Thanks Mastro's for a fantastic evening!"

I made reservations that day via Yelp and although we waited for about 15 minutes for our 9pm reservations, we were lucky enough to be seated in the Treehouse.  Very cool!  \n\nI had the lobster bisque for a starter and the bowl was HUGE!  It filled me up quite a bit and from the mid point on, I wished I had it to share but managed to drink it all.  It was a bit rich so I was kind of done with it before I finished it off but didn't want to waste any of it so I was a trooper and drank it to the last drop.  Chilean sea bass seemed to be the popular recommendation so that's what I ordered for my entree and that was definitely delicious.  It's a good thing I didn't order any sides because those two dishes totally filled me up!\n\nGreat place to try and would recommend at least going there once.  It is a bit pricey but I think worth the experience. Next time I go back, I'd like to go back with a whole bunch of people to get their seafood tower.  The table next to us ordered that and it looked really cool.  If not for the food, just to take a picture to post online.  Haha!"

Stayed at Palazzo and have eaten at Craftsteak, Cut, Delmonico, and being from Chicago, we know our way around our Beef (Nine, Gene and Georgetti's, Gibsons, Chicago Chop House, Keefers, Kinzie...).  Considered return to Cut, booked and unbooked Carnevino and Prime before settling on Mastro's because of our evening plans (Mandarin Oriental for drinks) and because we've wanted to try the newbie here in Chicago.  \n\nRequest, and wait for if necessary, the tree house dining.  \n\nMike R (ASK FOR HIM, HE'S THAT GOOD) did an excellent job with the pacing of our meal.  He knew it was our anniversary and he made sure to congratulate us several times, chat us up without being intrusive, and sincerely took an interest in making our experience pleasurable.\n\nWife had the bone in Filet (12 oz) and I had the bone in Rib eye...plate, ordered the au gratin potatos to share (our server Mike R recommended one side to share due to the size) and the meal was worth every single of the five stars we are giving this place.    \n\nFor our anniversary, they treated us to their signature butter cake.  We were stuffed but did our due dilligence....very tasty, very good, and if you actually save room for it, worth ordering. \n\nUpon reflection, this was a perfect destination to celebrate an anniversary.  Live music was noticable, but not intrusive, the tree house, particularly when the sun went down, created a very romantic atmosphere.  Have read complaints about the setting (basically in the middle of the mall) but I don't share those complaints.  Yes, you are in a mall, albeit a mall the average person can walk through but not afford to shop in, but you hardly notice the people honestly.  Saw many people enjoying either bottles of wine (like us...oh, and yes the list has some mark up and bottles you would have to mortgage your home to afford, but also some very reasonably priced, well worth the mark up bottles to be enjoyed ... ) or their signature cocktails which were generous pours and will be on \"the list\" next time we visit.  \n\nBut I have to come back to Mkie R, he was a throwback, a restaurant professional who knows the food, knows the wine list, knows the importance of making your feel as though he is there only to make your experience memorable.  I am not kidding, REQUEST him when you visit, you will write me and thank me profusely if you do.  \n\nWe return to Vegas in September...will definitely drop by for drinks and desert at minimum."

Mastro's had always been well recommended by friends and family so i was excited to have a birthday meal there. We have a few locations in the Los Angeles area but never had a opportunity to dine at one. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes after opening and were seated promptly, our server (I forget his name :( so sorry) was amazing! Was very informative and accommodating. My girlfriend ordered the chilean sea bass and one prawn. I had the bone in rib eye steak and we shared a side of green beans and asparagus. My girlfriend ordered a delicious drink and while I couldn't decide on what to have myself our waiter brought out a amazing whiskey drink for me. \n\nOnce the food arrived it all looked so yummy, and here is when the problems began. I had ordered my steak medium rare, when I cut into the steak it was more medium / medium well. I thought maybe it was just the surrounding edges that were overcooked because that tends to happen with rib eye steaks. Once I cut closer to the bone it was evident it was overcooked. I called over the waiter and quickly had my steak sent back and a new one was on its way out. My girlfriends sea bass was amazing but the prawn she ordered was overcooked. While I waited for my replacement steak to arrive the manager came to our table to offer their apologies which was much appreciated. My replacement steak took quite some time enough time for my girlfriend to finish her meal while I sat there waiting for my food. \n\nOnce my new steak arrived I was eager to eat, the manager had them bring out fresh new sides which was unexpected but very appreciated. Manager had me cut into the steak to see if it was cooked properly and sadly it was also overcooked. I was disappointed and as I cut further in to check the center of the steak it was evident this steak was overcooked as well as chewy. The manager acknowledged it was overcooked and offered a replacement but at this point I just wanted to eat! I told him it was ok and that I would finish my steak and be on our way, needless to say my steak was comped. A few minutes into my second steak the manager let me know that they had another steak for me and I should slow down on finishing this one. I advised him I had no desire for a third steak and that there was no way I could finish it but he insisted.\n\nMy third steak was brought out and my second was taken away, again the manager asked me to check the cook on this third steak. Upon cutting into the steak it was raw, very raw...almost a blue steak. I was really disappointed at this point and the manager just walked away. Our server came to our table and asked me \"Do you like your steak like that?\" acknowledging how undercooked it was. At this point I was so upset that I just wanted to eat but could only finish a few extra bites. The manager brought out a free dessert with Happy Birthday written on the dish which was freaking delicious. The customer service is is really fantastic I can't stress that enough. Drinks are fantastic and the wait staff is top notch! And the steak was fantastic the next day when I had to for lunch and was reheated to a proper temp ;) \n\nI'll definitely return here for a second meal regardless of all the problems I experienced as I truly believe they deserve a second chance and I'll update my review accordingly. Thanks again to the staff at Mastro's Ocean Club for great service and attention. Special thanks to our waiter who was fantastic and to the manager who went above and beyond."

            "review": "Had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at Mastro's on a Friday night.  It was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  We were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  I'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  The place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  \n\nOur server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  She also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that Mastro's is located in Crystals on the Strip.  I didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the Strip.  \n\nTo start, I went with the lobster bisque.  This was one of the best versions of this dish I've had.  It was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  The sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  Just a creamy lobstery soup.  You may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but I think it was worth it (I can't recall the exact price, I believe it was either $16 or $18).  Additionally, a friend and I shared the ahi tuna tostada.  These come 3 to an order, but I could have easily eaten another dozen.  The tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  Crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  Loved it.\n\nWe split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from Australia.  It was $110, but well worth it.  It was noticeably better than the other steak.  Not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  It was.  But, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  Absolutely re-order if they have it available.  Plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.\n\nOn the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  It's good, but I don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  I didn't think the steaks needed it, so I only had a couple of bites with it.  The lobster mashed potatoes are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  The twice baked potato is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.\n\nFor dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  It easily lives up to its reputation.  Warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  Served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.  \n\nService was fantastic the entire time.  Our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  Our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  All in all, a great experience.  I can see why Mastro's has its reputation, I would absolutely return."

So expect to pay that much. \n\nThe sides comes out in family style in small platters. So you can take out what amount you want. \n\nThe wait staff pays attention to detail about you're visit. The waiters aren't overbearing. Always ask to be seated in the birds nest for an amazing experience. The architecture of the birds nest is truly magical. \n\nFive stars all around. \n\nGo get you're steak now."

The sculpture itself is lost on most.  At any rate, my girl and I were in to celebrate a special occasion and Mastro's just happened to fit the bill for what we were looking for.\n\nWe started with Oysters on the half shell along with a Lobster Bisque.  The oysters were a good size, not too briny and of the east coast variety.  The Lobster Bisque was excellent.  Chunks of lobster and the soup itself was neither watery nor too thick but with proper consistency and the temperature just perfect.  Main courses consisted of Chilean Sea Bass for her and the Scottish Salmon Filet.  I put my trust in the chef and opted to be surprised in the preparation of my salmon, and I was not disappointed as everything was prepared exactly as requested.  Sides to accompany the entrees were the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and some sauteed Asparagus.  Drinks to accompany the meal was a nice Sauvignon Blanc (the name escapes me) which went with everything as per recommended by our server.\n\nService-wise:  very attentive.  Our server ran through all of the specials for the night and answered any questions we may have had including selecting the wine to go with our entire meal start to finish on top of being entertaining.  If a course was complete, someone was present to take the item away.  Our glasses were never empty and staff (including the manager) made it a point to be sure that our needs were met and that everything was fine.  Bonus points for giving us a table right along the edge inside of the \"tree\" sculpture.  \n\nWord of warning:  portions are quite generous so either be prepared to share or come hungry.  \n\nIn short:  Top-notch service, good food, quality that pairs equally with the price.  You will not be disappointed."

Accompanied by 2 Garlic Toasted Bread Crisps. Delicous.\n\nEntrees:\n\nPetite Filet (Medium) - Hers - Simple but perfect. Mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection\n\nRack Of Lamb (Medium Rare) - Mine -  I love Lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best I can ever remember having. Bold but not gamey it flavor.\n(Jiraffe in Santa Monica is a close 2nd.)\n\nSides:\n\nSauteed Mushrooms w/ Onions  - Sweet & earthy. The perfect compliment to tender Filet & Lamb when combined with Mastro's Fries. \n\nSea Salt Shoestring Fries (No Vinegar) - Crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.\n\nDessert - \n\nChocolate Birthday Cake - Brought out complimetary. Nothing special but a nice birthday gesture. \n\nWarm Butter Cake Ala Mode - You simply HAVE to get this! \nNo meal at Mastro's would be complete without it. My wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. It's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.\n\n I have to say we left very impressed with our Mastro's Las Vegas experience. It definitely raises Mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (Just not the Beverly Hills location.)With food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong. \n\nNext up for us is Mastros in Thousand Oaks."

The Lobster mashed potatoes were ok and NOT worth $39 as you barely tasted the lobster and all you tasted were massive amounts of butter.  I would have been happy with garlic mash.  The mushrooms were amazing and probably the tastiest item we ordered.  The really expensive fries were soggy and didn't have much flavor at all.\n\nThe manager was nice enough to not charge us for the overly cooked steak but it was quite disappointing to go to specialty restaurant where they don't know how to cook their meat the right way.

Celebrating our wedding anniversary and completely giddy, we sat down, ordered cocktails and dove into the incredible bread basket.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the start, but no big deal, we ignored it.  I ordered chicken (please spare me the \"you don't order chicken at a seafood place\" lecture...I ordered it because it was on the menu, so let's get through that, k? Lol).  Our waiter was non-existent all evening, so he wasn't around at all for me to tell him that the chicken was glaringly under-cooked.  The manager happened to see us looking around and took it back to the kitchen.  He brought the same re-cooked piece back, but one spot (it was a really thick piece) still didn't look ok.  We had the flash light out and kinda debated if it was cooked enough, but the chance of eating slightly under-cooked chicken and getting sick was not an appealing option to me.  (And should I be having this debate at such a fine restaurant?).  I decided not to chance it, but not say anything.  The manager saw me not eating (our waiter was still in abandonment mode), took it away and insisted on replacing it with a filet.  The filet came out and was delicious and we were happy, albeit the mood had changed.  We felt like we had done something wrong.  Honestly, our least favorite meal of the whole weekend.  No butter cake, no second drinks--happy anniversary to us.  :(\n\nThank you to the manager for not charging us for my chicken or filet and really trying to fix it, but I'm so sad we spent our anniversary there."

Although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. I took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and\nIndulge more. \n\nFor dinner I had the Hawaiian tuna served sashimi style. It was seared with Asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. I will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming. \nThey warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. I had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man I came out of there a fatty wack. I LOVED the Cream corn and Alaskan Crab truffle gnocchi. Done deal with those two! I had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. We also had saut\u00e9ed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. They serve you the sides which I thought was a great service. \n\nThey gave us their signature butter cake. Topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. If you even last this long to have dessert then order it. Warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order. \n\nI would highly recommended this place. It's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. Great service and great food. You really can't go wrong."

No problems here, as Mastro's was very accommodating. When I came to check in, they were already aware that I had a two hour window before the show and made sure I'd be good to go. Off to a great start!\n\nSeeing as I didn't eat any steak earlier in the trip, I had to get one here. It was super tasty and although a little closer to medium than medium rare, turned out to be just as fantastic. The chilean sea bass, which many yelpers have gotten, is excellent pan seared and a good sized portion as well. We also ordered sides of the lobster mashed potatoes and a half order of the Alaskan crab black truffle gnocchi. Both were served table side and both had huge chunks of lobster and king crab, respectively.\n\nWith about half an hour to go, our waitress knew about our showtime as well and brought us out the signature butter cake, which is a must order here. You're in Vegas; this thing is crazy buttery but oh man, you have to try it. If I'm staying at the Aria again next time, I would order this dessert to go to take back to the room.\n\nHuge thumbs up for excellent service and the live music was fun and we got on our way on time. With a very cool atmosphere and location, I want to thank Mastro's for a memorable meal, I approve!"

We wanted it to be special and seeing 4.5 stars in Yelp, I figured I was sure to impress. \n\nThey did accommodate my request to sit in the tree house section of the restaurant, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, that's about all that went right for the evening. Our server was very aloof and completely inattentive. It felt as though we were bothering her by our existance.\n\nWe brought our drinks from the bar and were met by our server fairly promptly. After the perfunctory \"welcome to Mastros\" which seemed a strain for her to do, we didn't see our server for at least 20 Min's before she came back to check on us & take our order. She was very indifferent to our even being there, so much so, that I made the comment to my wife, that she was probably having a bad day. \n\nHere's where the fun begins. After receiving our salads which were very good, the fire alarm in the entire mall and restaurant started going off. So here we are with bright lights flashing all around us and the blaring wooooop......wooooop of the alarm is drowning out the piano player while everyone of the staff is walking around as if nothing is going on. We are all looking at ourselves and asking each other, is this for real? should we be evacuating? What if there is a fire? Finally after a FULL 10 minutes of this, I ask another server passing by what was going on. She politely said \"ohhh it's probably just a door someone opened\" and went on her merry way\". \n\nWhen our dinner arrived, our server never said a word about the incessant fire alarm blaring for the last 30 Min's. Not an \"I'm sorry about this\" or \"don't worry there is no emergency\", or we are working on shutting it off. No....Nothing at all. She just dropped off our food not to be seen again until I asked for the check. It was very bizarre \n\nNow about the food. We all had some type of fish. Which was mostly good. I thought my dusted halibut was very bland. I only ate half of my serving even though I was rather Hungary. The Gorgonzola mac & cheese was very good. The asparagus was decent. \n\nAll told we finished up and even canceled the birthday desert  I reserved, because we couldn't stand the fire alarm any longer. The only thing our server said was, \" ohh your leaving,? yeah I guess the fire alarm is a bit annoying. Which is kind of like saying, \" yeah Vegas a bit warm in the summer\". \n\nAll told, the food was 3.5 stars and the service was 1 star. At least I impressed my mother-in-law with the Jersey Boys show right before dinner. Now that was 5 Stars!"

We were greeted at our table with 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate. We spilt the most delicious wedge salad and it was good. Last year we had apps and the lobster mashed potatoes as a side. Those were so good they'll make you wanna slap your momma!  We were so full I am embarrassed to say we didn't even finish our steaks. This year we switched to Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese...epic!  I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the 12oz filet mignon.  Both were the finest steaks we've ever had. You will never appreciate any other steak after that. Mastros ruined steak for me, talk about melt in your mouth. Our server Mark was phenomenal and super attentive. A really nice guy. For desert they brought out the warm butter cake...wonderful!  Mastros is the only place I would eat in my life if I had the choice. Thank you  for a wonderful first anniversary dinner. GO THERE!!!!"

This restaurant is located within the new City Center mall and was ultra convenient to get to from the Aria Hotel.  We started the night by sitting at the live Piano Bar in the lounge and ordering Pomegranate Martini's on dry ice.  The Martini's bubbled from the dry ice.  It was very cool and they were oh so good.\n\nAs far as the food goes... the meat is so tender and cooked to perfection.  My husband and I split an 18 oz. Bone-In Steak and it was more than we could possibly eat.  The steak was gigantic.  It was also really nice that they cut it for us and brought it out on two plates.  With 4 people we ordered 3 separate side dishes and it was way too much food.  One side will feed 3 - 4 people easily, but they are all so good you have to try more than one. \n\nBy the time the chocolate birthday cake was served we were all so full that we had one bite and that was all but it was really good too.\n\nThe servers were really good and the atmosphere was perfect.  The tree house was really neat.\n\nThis is a definite must try.  Oh and I almost forgot... We shared the Lobster Bisque to start and it was the best ever.  We also really enjoyed the different breads in the basket.  I think the waitress said that the Pretzels come from Germany.  If you want an amazing dinner you have to try this place."

The apple martini comes out smoking, we also saw a Cosmo come out the same way.  A really cool touch!  We order an appetizer of shrimp cocktail, it come with three but since there were two of us Lionel ( our server) suggested we get four, so we did.  They were huge and very tastie.  The cocktail sauce was delicious along with some very hot horseradish, perfect balance.  We also ordered ahi tuna as an appetizer, this was amazing too.  Ordered salmon prepared blackened style and my husband order tuna Asian style with a side of asparagus.  We ordered way to much food as the portions are very generous.  We then had raspberries sorbet, which was to die for.   So, I mentioned large portions..we took home tuna, salmon and asparagus to our hotel room and ate a wonderful lunch in the room the next day.  They also boxed up the bread, which is a variety of sourdough, pretzel roll and something like a baguette.  Our lunch was just as good as our dinner.  I mentioned Lionel earlier in my post.  Well, you must request him as your server, he is personable and very professional at the same time.  Be sure to sit in the tree house.  It is expensive, but well worth the splurge!"

Ive been there probably 20 times and ive never had a bad anything. Ive had everything on the menu because we often go to dinner with about 20 people so we order everything. Great wines, really fresh seafood, but the side dishes and desserts is what really sets them apart from others. My fav sides are brussels sprouts, scalloped potatoes, creamed corn, gorgonzola mac n cheese and mushrooms. For desserts nothing is better than the butter cake and pecan pie. If youre not a fan of raspberry sauce like myself you can order the butter cake without the raspberry and its heavenly! Its romantic enough for a date and trendy enough for dinner before going out with friends- like i said best restaurant in the entire world!"

They brought us to the bar while we waited for our table.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised that the drinks we ordered were actually strong; usually other restaurants are stingy with their alcohol.  Maybe it was due to being in Las Vegas, but those drinks were tasty and strong.  A few minutes later we were seated inside the tree house.  The staff were very attentive to us.  We ordered ahi tuna and a filet to share. A couple of side orders of veggies, salad, crab cakes and some bread completed our meal.  I really thought that we would not have enough food but I couldn't finish it all!\n\nWe promised ourselves that we would come back just for dessert- and we did return the next day! - just for the chocolate pudding cake and their cheesecake.  I LOVE their pudding cake and I am not a chocolate person!  Again, their service was outstanding. Crazy busy on a Friday or Saturday night or slow like a Sunday dinner, the staff never forgot about you.\n\nIf you ever want to experience great service and food - consistently, mastro's ocean club in Las Vegas is a sure bet."

Made a quick reservation on Yelp and we showed up around 9:30pm. The bar was lively.

The rib eye was also average - the talk about the plate being 400 degrees when it's brought to you - i think they needed to add the 400 degrees to the broiler - i ordered medium but it was rare. more bothersome, it didn't have that nice outer sear bordering on crunch - it was too soft ! flavor was decent. \n\nSome nice pinot noir wines - even though the host gave me the wine list to order, i showed restraint - a Laetitia from Paso Robles and a forgotten Oregon - both under $90 each"

Best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary \"pod\" in the middle of Crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  Unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  \"I'm hungry after all YOUR shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat\".\n\nWith the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. No special sauces, no veg.  Just fish or beef on a plate.  \n\nPortions are large.  Unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  They are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  You can get them anywhere.  \n\nFish is expertly cooked to order.  The thick cut fillet of pan roasted Chilean sea bass and salmon are excellent.  Cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  Both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  \n\nGood quality prime steaks.  Decent aging.  Good selection of bone in cuts.   Sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in Vegas.  The bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  No complaints.  \n\nFor sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the lobster mashed potatoes.  Chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  I could eat either an a main and be happy!  \n\nSolid wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.\n\nSometimes \"a kiss is just a kiss...\"  and that's fine by me."

I've never had ahi tuna which was also ordered by some in the group & they were very happy with their choice (it did look good). . The waiters hustled, but at the end of our meal I requested a coffee & never got it while others did. We managed to get dessert the warm butter cake. Yum!!!  It just felt like they were overwhelmed.  I'd rather come to visit just the hubby & I for our 2nd visit."

Now that i've got your attention.\n\nService: One word excellent. I'd like to start off by saying that I came here for my 21st birthday and you know how usually you'll mention it to restaurants in hopes of getting something free and they'll come out with some weak bite sized dessert. My boyfriend's parents were the one who mentioned it and I quickly got a happy birthday and I expected nothing of it after. But for dessert I actually got a full on, very generous portion of a piece of chocolate cake (with raspberries!). It had come while I was in the bathroom so I wasn't expecting the waiter to relight it again but he actually did! The waiters were very nice, they made jokes and conversation (not just about food but where we were from, etc) They really knew their stuff, like not just knew what the specials were but they were very knowledgeable about their menu.\n\nFood: For starters we ordered escargot, chilled seafood, and crabcakes. The escargot was probably the disappointment of the evening. I've had much better elsewhere. There was just no taste or not a great taste. It wasn't gross or anything but I've just basically tasted better marinated or sauced escargot. For the chilled seafood, you're allowed to pick however many pieces you want and what seafood you want on it. It came in this platter that had dry ice in it. The shrimp were so plump and juicy. The crab was the best part though. I don't even know how to describe it but my boyfriend and I were fighting for the last pieces, just popping them into our mouths one by one. \n-Rack of Lamb: So juicy! It was probably the best lamb I've ever had. The taste was there, it was perfectly cooked. \n\nDessert: We ordered their signature cake and it was very unique. I don't think I\"ve ever tasted anything like it but I wasn't raving about it as much as the rest of my table were. It tasted like butterscotch or toffee angel/sponge cake. I couldn't really put my foot on what it was, it was just so different. \n\nBathroom: This is actually the first bathroom I've been to where it had a bathroom attendant who handed you towels. They had tampons and other amenities on the counter. She opened and closed the door for me. It's too bad I didn't have my wallet to tip her but she was very nice. \n\nView: Where we were seated, you could basically look out into the mall and people watch. \n\nMy boyfriend and I will definitely be back to this chain, maybe for an anniversary."

            "review": "I will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!\n\nWe had reservations for Saturday Night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. I am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. I don't care how fancy the mall is, I think mall food every time I dine at one. Mastro's my friends is no Mall Food Place.\n\nThe Service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while I'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. It was like they were our dedicated staff.\n\nThe meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).\n\nThe Bread basket was a good start, it had Pretzel Bread, olive bread, a Parmesan crisp, and few other breads. The sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. We had Creamed Corn (some of the best I've ever had), Creamed Spinach, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, King Crab Gnocchi, and Mushrooms. We also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 Caesars (one regular and one spicy), Tomato and Onion, and Tomato and Mozzarella. A seafood tower and crab cakes were also ordered, I'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. \n\nThey entrees were pretty stellar as well, I was splitting the 33oz Wagyu Tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, I had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things I have to do). This was one of the best pieces of Cow I've had in my life (and I've had A LOT of cow). It was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect IMO), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. I don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. \n\nTable mates also got the Seabass, A Filet, and a few other meats, I was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their filets were about 12oz servings.\n\nAfter dinner, they brought out a Warm Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!\n\nI have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. My only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. They did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.\n\nWill I be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!"

My husband and I went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. I made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.  \n\nWe ordered the beef Carpaccio to start.  It took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  The beef Carpaccio was SO salty and came with a weird Caesar salad combination on top as aside. The dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it. \n\nAs our main entrees we ordered a petite filet and lamp chops. DRY, DRY, DRY! I'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  That wasn't the case at all. So disappointed. \n\nTo end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entr\u00e9e we didn't even want dessert. As the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says Happy Anniversary and walks away.  No complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. Oh well...I will go back to SAGE inside Aria which is the BEST steak house I have ever been too."

Unfortunately with the rather loud \"Billy Joel wannabe\" pianist playing all night, and the shoppers strolling by looking at your dining selection, this place does not rate as well as it should.  \n\nWhile the service was outstanding, the quality was mediocre when comparing it to other similar, better located, places in Vegas.  Price hurts a little too...guess the uberMall rents are high so the costs need to be passed along to the diners.\n\nSince service is one half of a successful dining experience, this is what saved it from garnering a single star.\n\nIf you are looking for convenience and staying at Aria or Vdara, you could try this place....or you could walk a little further to other higher end dining experiences."

Made reservations online indicating our celebration and when we arrived reception greeted my folks with a cheery \"happy birthday!\" \n\nWe ordered a bottle of Cabernet and a bottle of pelligrino to go along with our warm bread basket. Started with shared Caesar salad and ocean club salad which the kitchen split for us, that's always a nice gesture when a restaurant does this. I enjoyed the ocean club salad, fresh, with shrimp, chopped tomato, egg, and bacon. Salads were dressed just right. We ordered steaks all around except for my mom who ordered the Chilean sea bass along with fresh asparagus, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and scalloped potatoes. Entrees were cooked perfectly and delicious, I had a piece of mom's sea bass and it was to die for! Sides were good with the exception of the scalloped potatoes which were way too salty (maybe I shouldn't have said yes to add Gruyere cheese). The finale was Mastro's warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream with piping around the plate \"happy 80th birthday\" and coffees. Wow, cake was sumptuous and so very good!\n\nReally a wonderful, leisurely evening bonding and reminiscing. Glad we chose Mastro's to celebrate a special event! A special thanks to our server, Tim who was so friendly and patient with us. He even walked with dad to show him where the men's room was. He's the best!"

A few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.  The rest are inside the \"treehouse,\" a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of Crystals.\n\nAlthough very cool looking, it's VERY LOUD.  In between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.  I would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.  \n\nThere were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.  Like, packs of them.  Very weird.\n\nFOOD\n\nAs we were in a \"small plate\" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:\n\nSauteed Sea Scallops ($22)- Three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.  Unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy. I'd probably pass on scallops next time.\n\nBeef Bone Marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.   Delicious, decadent and full of flavor.  We gobbled it all up.\n\nSeared Ahi Tuna encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).  Overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked. \n\nWedge salad - ($12) Big portion and very good.  I liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.  This allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.  The dressing was a tad watery, the way I like it. Well executed.  But, it's a salad, so......\n\nThen we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):\n\nKing Crab Black Truffle Gnocci - Salty, rich and so delicious.  Lots of king crab chunks. My favorite thing I tried.\n\nLobster Cheese Mashed Potatoes -Although rich, it wasn't that flavorful. Mostly salty, not complex. I did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though. \n\nI have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of Shiraz).\n\nOverall, good service and big portions.  It's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.  \n\nDefinitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.  This is your mecca."

We were very pleased with the meal.\n\nWe got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  I really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  There were five choices in the basket.\n\nCourse 1:  We each got a salad--my wife's was a Caesar and mine was their spicy mambo salad.  They were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  Both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.\n\nCourse 2:  I ordered the Scottish salmon and Andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  I had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and I chose the blackened option.  The salmon was delicious.  The filet was very good, too.  \n\nWith their Restaurant Week menu, diners can choose two sides.  We each ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the creamed spinach and I got the creamed corn.  The sides were huge.  Since we each ordered the mashed potatoes, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  The corn and spinach were smaller versions.  All three were very good.  I needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  Samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.\n\nCourse 3:  For dessert, Andrea got the chocolate layer cake and I got the Key lime pie.  ALong with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  The chocolate cake was huge.  My Key lime pie was more a normal size.  Both were outstanding!!\n\nWe ate in the Tree House overlooking the shops at Crystals.  Service was superb!  Our server, Samantha, was excellent.  The staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that I'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  \n\nI am so glad Mastros participated in Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to try it and I will be back.  What a fantastic start to RW Fall 2012."

Checked back a couple of times and the hostess was a bit aloof.  I assume it was because there were numerous people waiting for their reservations.  Checked back at 8:45 to be told that best case was another 20 minutes....not sure the point in reservations if you don't get to keep them.  Sure the food is good but we left to find something else."

            "review": "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.\n\nThis restaurant is location in the middle of Crystals on the Strip.  From the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". It sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out I feel a little disappointed, because I felt like I was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  LV, Jimmy Choo, and Zegna.  Not exactly, the scene I expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.\n\nHowever, service was impeccable, except we were only told the beef carpaccio was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  In a rush we picked tuna tartare as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the chopped salad,  king crab legs and sea bass.  \n\nWe ordered a bottle of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc for $70. Given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. The wine list is comprehensive.\n\nI am kind of bored with tuna tartare, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  It is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  \n\nThe mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  I just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; I like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   Definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. \n\nChopped salad was solid and I like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.\n\nThe King Crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. I was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  \n\nI love Chilean Sea Bass prepared any way, but I it was pan-fried to perfection.  The outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  The serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.\n\nNo room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  Very generous.\n\nOverall, pretty good, but again I couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. We left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.\n\nDon't know why it is called \"beach club\".  The environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  That may be a good thing, though.\n\nWill I go again? Probably not, I think Joe's Seafood (NOT the Crab Shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better."

As the main course of course I had to eat lobster because I am not an animal! When it was time for dessert I was too full for anything so I enjoyed a double espresso so I would be ready for a Vegas night! \n\nI really should mention the ambience. The location is so cool it sort of feels like you are seated in the skeleton of a wine barrel or an old ship. The beautiful polished wood and dim lighting it had a very romantic feeling. Plus it is elevated in the heart of this shopping area so you can watch all the people passing by. I would definitely go again!"

            "review": "Wow, what a huge disappointment!  I have always heard good things about this chain, including this location in Vegas.  This is a high-end (very pricey) steak joint, so you expect (a) a REALLY good steak and (b) prompt efficient service.  Ocean Club failed on both counts during our recent dinner.  Had we not been pressed for time, I definitely would have had a candid (blunt) discussion with the manager regarding our disappointment.  Our party of 12 was promptly seated and we had two waiters to handle the large party.  \nFailure #1 - drink orders were taken from the ladies and those came out quickly (within 5-10 minutes); they didn't take drink orders from the guys for another 5-10 minutes and we waited a good 15 minutes before they came out.  They messed up on two of the drink orders (stuff that shouldn't have been a mistake).\nFailure #2 - they screwed up on one of the steak orders (ordered rib-eye - I was sitting right next to him, so I knew that is what he ordered), they apologized profusely and said they would expedite the correct steak.  10 minutes later guess what comes out?  The WRONG steak again!  Fortunately most of the guys got larger steaks, so we shared so that our friend wouldn't be left eating alone.\nFailure #3 - I had ordered my steak medium rare, but it came out much closer to medium-well.  For a high-end steakhouse, this should never happen - steaks should come out consistent / match what the customer ordered.\n\nThe only positive note was the side dishes were all very good.  Other reviews are consistent on the rave reviews of the sides.\n\nGiven how much we spent on dinner, it was a massive disappointment.  \n\n8/31 Update - after posting my review, I did get a personal call from the GM of the restaurant.  He was very apologetic and I believe he was sincere in soliciting my feedback to ensure the risk of this happening to other patrons is minimized.  As a gesture of good faith, he did offer a gift card for use at any Mastro's location.  To be honest, had this call not happened, I would have never set foot in this restaurant chain again.  But, because of this gesture, we did go to the Beverly Hills location and had an AMAZING meal (I'll post a separate review for that location)."

It is located in the Crystals shopping plaza that is next to the Aria hotel. This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. \n\nI made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\nI still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. \n\nWe also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\nDessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nThis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. I highly recommend it."

Located in the newly designed City Center, just look for the beautifully designed \"tree house\", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in Crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  Be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit. \n\nMastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in Vegas is.  In any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  I started off with a very rich and tasty New England Clam Chowder.  For my entree, I went with the porcini mushroom crusted sea bass with fried spinach.  It was light but delicious!! Perfect for lunch.  For the side dish, what else but the lobster mashed potatoes! I'm not talking about lobster flavored mashed potatoes.  No, no, not at Mastro's.  I'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the mashed potatoes.  It was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  Although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). I highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. We all loved it.\n\nI should note that the cocktails were also great.  Make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  Pretty cool. \n\nAlthough I was able to get a table for four for lunch on a Saturday with ease through OpenTable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  Soon, Mastro's will one of the hottest tables in Vegas so get in while you can."

It's worth the $16 to spend, it's a warm yellow buttery cake that's crispy on the outside, with sugar coating and warm and gooey on the inside. There's a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and the whole thing is finished with raspberry drizzle. It also comes with a large side of house whipped cream! \n\nThe first time I dined at the restaurant, I received stellar service; this second time around I saw my server 3 times during our meal and I wasn't impressed with his serving qualities. \n\nAll in all, it is definitely an experience to dine at mastros.

Just to let you know this is not our first time eating escargot, it's one of our favorite dishes, so we've had it plenty of times. As for the entrees we got the swordfish, which was extremely dry and tasteless. We also got the seabass, which was over cooked and the filet steak which was over chard. It was very disgusting! Very disappointed in the food.  How can we tell our server that all of the food that came out was disgusting. We didn't want to make a scene so we just ate what we could, paid and left. Our first and last time ever going there. The price that you pay for the food, it was definitely not worth it. We've had 100 times better.

As for the PRICES - hey, it's Vegas, it's going to be expensive; however, there are thousands of restaurants that are overpriced and you feel ripped off when you are done - not Mastro's!

In the grand scheme of steakhouses, I'd rate the food a solid 4, perhaps a 5, but the attention to detail by the staff, fantastic cocktails, wonderful ambiance, and late hours helped Mastro's earn a 5th star in its belt.\n\nI was a bit peeved that we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table at the bar, but the generous cocktail pours helped soothe the senses.  Plus, we were late to our reservation by an hour and a half so I had to throw them a bone (haha!).  We arrived around 10:30pm and were surprised to find a happening bar scene and a 75% full dining room.  We left past 1am, but the staff was gracious and didn't try to rush us out even when we were the second to last table in the restaurant.\n\nThe food was delicious.  We may have over ordered on the appetizers, but we hadn't eaten in 12 hours so we figured we would indulge a bit.  Very fresh oysters with all the fixings with lemon halves that were wrapped in cheesecloth and speared onto a fork.  Great detail.  Smoked salmon plate was also good.  The fried calamari was ok - good, but certainly have had better.  My bone-in rib-eye was great.  Cooked a little past medium rare, but still tasted wonderful - a nice char on the outside, lightly salted crust.  The side dishes were also good, in particular the mac and cheese, but get it while it's still warm.  At the end of our meal, our coffee order came out a bit lukewarm, but it was close to closing time so I gave them a pass.  In honor of the groom, the staff also brought out a dessert with the words \"Don't do it!\" written in chocolate on the borders of the plate.  Again, great attention to detail.\n\nI really think this is where Mastro's shines.  The details.  We were asked whether we wanted a black napkin versus a white one to minimize lint getting onto dark pants when we sat down.  I just received a phone call today asking whether we enjoyed our experience and to visit again.  I might have had a better steak elsewhere (not by much), but it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that focuses on the little details that elevate a dining experience into a fine dining experience.

So we sat at the bar and had a nice glass of malbec - a very generous glass of wine - with a very friendly bartender, Melissa.  She explained the menu to us in great detail and told us exactly what we should order the next time we visited."

The hostess was very nice and recommended a table for us right by the window in the tree house.  The waiter was very polite and super friendly. Besides recommending some of the meals, he had some personal conversations with us and it turned out that he is not too far from where I live.   Now to the important part..... For appetizer we had escargot, which was really good.  For main entree we ordered a lobster special that was recommended by the waiter and the lamb chops.  Both entrees were very tasty and made just right.  Some of the best meals ive ever had.  For dessert we ordered cherry pie which was really good, but very large, we had maybe a 3rd between the 2 of us.  If you get dessert, i recommend you split it. As a matter of fact, both entrees were very generous sizes and we couldn't finish it all.\nI highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. The food, the service and the atmosphere are fantastic."

So, I'm back!\n\nMastros is one of the few steakhouse chains that I would say can compete with the best steakhouses around. Ive been to a few in California and all are great. The one in Vegas keeps the tradition alive and well. Crystals is a swanky shopping area in the Strip so this is definitely a place you'd expect to drop some serious coin. And this is Vegas so if you aren't planning on it then you can leave.\n\nChopped Salad- well it was salady. Standard dish and easy to split.\n\nBone in Filet 12 oz- Probably the best filet I've had in Vegas. Cooked perfect medium rare.\n\nLobster Mash- obvi delicious but probably an unnecessary 30 dollar side.\n\nRoasted Brussel sprouts- Idk how they cooked these but they were the best brussel sprouts Ive had period. Even my father who hates them couldn't deny that they were great.\n\nWarm Butter Cake- Ah yes the buttery goodness. One of my favorite desserts whenever it's on a menu no matter the restaurant. Mastro's does it right.\n\nThe reason Mastro's is legit is that it keeps the traditional steakhouse vibe of olden times and perfects it. None of menu items are crazy out there or artistic concoctions like at GR Steak but the quality of the food is not debatable. There is no chain steakhouse as good as Mastro's let me tell you."

And keep in mind I'm not asking for you guys to bend over backwards to keep us happy, but the attitude needs a lot of improvement from the host to the server. \n\nI didn't keep that in mind for long because we were here for the food anyway and I thought the food will make up for it. We order the hamachi appetizer, which was the only decent tasting dish. We ordered the sea bass, rack of lamb and scallop. They were all just super basic dishes. It was literally just a protein with no sauce whatsoever! I could have done this at home and this would have tasted better at a local BJs. I expected much better from you guys. \n\nThen when we were about to leave I asked for a box so I could take the bread to go so that we could snack on it later. I got attitude and was asked twice am I sure I did not want to take the courses to go. There's a reason why we didn't ask for box to go and we obviously thought it was NOT good enough to take it to go, and I understand why our server gave us attitude. He thought we were wasteful, but the food sucked so just leave us alone and don't ask twice with an attitude. \n\nI would skipped this place if you're in Vegas, you can find much better places to eat around here. I understand sometimes it sucks to be working on a holiday or the weekend, but keep in mind we all work too and we spend good money to have a good meal out here too. We don't deserve any of this nasty attitude or food."

Unfortunately for us, many of the restaurants that served seafood were primarily steakhouses.  We read a few yelp reviews for Mastro's among others and eventually made a reservation here for dinner that same night.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated inside the \"tree house\" that's suspended in the center of the shops.  We ordered a bottle of Shiraz, the halibut and the sea bass encrusted with their special seasoning, and macaroni and cheese.  Our water was never more than half empty at any given time throughout our entire meal.  \n\nThe food and wine turned out to be amazing!  Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was kind enough to ask if we wanted the rest, including the wine, boxed up since I had been feeling sick to finish it.  \n\nA few tips if you visit, the sides are quite large, probably enough to split with up to 4 people.  Trust your waiter/waitress.  Ours suggested the preparation we had on our fish and we were not disappointed.  And the price is a bit high but well worth it in the end.  I would definitely go back here again."

For sides just the sauteed mushrooms.\n\nPortions are huge, but had a few dissapointments considering the price. Although we'resure the waitress spoke off different kinds of Preparing the meat (grilled, blackend, etc.) she didn't asked we would like the meat prepared. Looking at the meat of our neigbours we asked which cooking that was. Turned out to be rare. Just a little too pink for us so we asked the meat to be cooked medium. Can tell you, what we got was definitely way beyond medium. Almost welldone. And no,we didn't send it back. I know, we should have.\n\nThe mushrooms were perfectly cooked and huge. Like the portion. More than enough to satisfy four. The bisque was oke but both appetizers, the spinach salad and Ahi Tuna Tartare were flat. The salad being nothing special and the Tuna was way to cold  discover any taste at all. I also don't understand the fried things (onions?) on the bottom.\n\nBest experiences were the setting, despite the location, the services and the bread.

That's not my complaint. My complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. I'm glad I kept my receipt.\n\nThis prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. The manager told me that the company they use AUTOMATICALLY adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. \n\nThis was not disclosed to us by the waitress. It was not disclosed on our receipt. In fact, when I called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. FIX IT if people are complaining. You have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this BEFORE  they eat.\n\nTips are VOLUNTARY, not mandatory unless disclosed. I leave my tips in cash and I always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  The money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. That is basically theft. \n\nSo now, I have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means I won't see my money until Tuesday or Wednesday, since we ate there Friday night. Other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.\n\n1) The customer service is great except for not disclosing that I'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.\n\n2) The  crab cakes were good, but both my wife and I had a small piece of shell. Nothing worth complaining about.\n\n3) My wife had the blackened ribeye. It was delicious.\n\n4) I had rack of lamb. it was delicious.\n\n5) Twice baked potato was good.\n\n6) Gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.\n\n7) Clam chowder was good.\n\n8) Calamari was just OK.\n\n9) The complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. I don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. \n\nOverall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.\n\nIf you eat here PAY CASH."

And of course we had to try the seafood tower. I love that you can build it yourself! Our waiter was so pleasant and attentive. Seriously he just made the night. Wish I could remember his name but all I remember was thay he was Canadian lol Only because I am a die hard Michael Bubl\u00e8 fan lol"

I was in Vegas with friends, and my buddy said i should try this place out  and i would love it.  i was skeptic at best..\n\nWe had a group of 8 and we decided to do family style and order apps.  We ordered the bone marrow, escargot, scallops, and calamari  \n\nThe bone marrow was okay in my opinion, but everyone loved it on my table.  I would have like some more accompaniment to enhance the flavors.  There was plenty of marrow, bread and  micro greens, and fine sea salt flakes.  It was very rich and flavor, but i had better.  it is still worth it.\n\nThe scallops were perfectly pan seared, and it came with a pleasant herb-y butter sauce.  Each bite was amazing and when you are done with the scallops.  The sauce was great for  bread  dipping.\n\nThe escargot was good.  it came with the standard butter, garlic and shallots.  T\nhere is probably a few other herbs in there, but we ate them too fast to really look.\n.  \nThe friend calamari was good and came with two sauce, tartar, and i think a remoulade.  After having the other items, i wasn't too impressed.  This would be a great dish, if it was somewhere else. But we are talking about Mastro's.\n\nThe OMG moment was a  bone in petite filet we ordered.  When i first saw it, i was very disappointed when i saw the waiter cut it,  It look raw.  I was thinking how can a place like this, don't know the difference between medium rare and raw.  Boy was i wrong.  The table decide we should try it and not waste it, because we all thought the same thing.  But when i bit into it, it was the most wonderful steak i had in recent memory.  It has a full of flavor, it was season to perfection.  Every bite, i wanted another one.   In the end, i would have fought off the table for the bone.  Lucky for me, no one wanted it.  I love the acidic marinade they used for the steak.  I guess it is a balsamic vinegar marinade.  Man, i want to go back so badly.\n\nAnyway, i don't think i can top anything else in this review.  I have to say the signature pound cake was good, but you must really have a sweet tooth.  \n\nWaiters and bus people were amazing and entertaining.  they are here to give you the best experience they can.    so please tip well.\n\nThe decor is amazing, just go look at the pictures online.  \n\nNow i just want to go to any Mastro's and have that steak again."

Called for Reservations a week ahead and they called me the day off to confirm. I told them we were running 15 min late and they said it might take longer to seat us.\n\nWe ended up waiting 30 minutes before we gave up and left since we had a show to get to. I don't think pushing the reservations 15 back should have made that much of a dramatic wait difference - isn't the point of a reservation is to HOLD the table for me? Whats the diff between holding it 15min in the beginning than if i took an extra 15 min to eat/sit there?  Anyways, as we were waiting at the bar, another couple had  reservation as well and they were waiting longer than we were and also getting fed up.What's weird was there was a decent amount of empty tables so it wasn't like very table was filled to capacity. \n\nDon't think I'll attempt to eat at this place, whats the point of reservations if you have to wait?"

It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. \n\nThe bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? \n\nLobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines. \n\nWe celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious."

We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and we made reservations a couple of weeks prior. When we got there, the hostesses were not only rude to the patrons, but also rude to each other.  They were talking back to each other, rolling their eyes and just plain unpleasant. \n\nThe servers were great to the patrons, but we were sitting pretty close to the kitchen/bar and could hear the conversations of the servers and management and could tell that they just don't get along well. That made the experience a little bit of a downer. \n\nAs far as the food, I was just so disappointed!!!! Talk about the biggest let down ever! We spent about $300 on everything and it was not worth it. \n\nFirst course was the Clear Lobster Rolls which were ok but we could get better sushi for less elsewhere. We also got the tuna sashimi, also good but had too many sesame seeds.  Second course was the clam chowder which was really good! The part that upset me though was when our main course arrived, I was still eating the soup, but then they took my soup away mid-bite and didn't even ask if I was still eating or not. \n\nOur main courses were the twin lobster tails, which were really salty. My husband got the Chilean sea bass which was pretty dry but my husband said the flavor was good, but since it was dry, it felt kind of dense. We also got the mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Both were delicious and seasoned well. \n\nAll in all, we will probably never go back again. The only good thing was that they did give my husband a complimentary cake for his birthday. We enjoyed the cake and the cream that came on the side.\n\nAverage food, mediocre service for a really high price. Not good."

The staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  We were able to make reservations through Yelp and OpenTable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  The piano entertainment was first class. Our server, Racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  Her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  She not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"Butter Cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  Very good stuff. I can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  Sheri and I can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  I highly recommend any of the filets, shriimp cocktail, king crab, lobster mashed potatoes, lobster bisque, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the red snapper.  They will split any plate they have, upon request."

Even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. Steak was incredible, portions were generous. We couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but I doubt you can go wrong. \n\nI had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". Again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than I could finish. Having lived in Boston and Maryland I'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and crab cakes, so I tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. The crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (I tend to prefer broiled.) The steak was better than top steak houses in DC/NY. Honestly. Find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!\n\nFor \"family style\" sides we ordered creamed spinach (unnecessary), crab gnocchi (food heaven), lobster mashed potatoes (must get), and sweet potato fries (I didn't even bother as I had too much more interesting food already). The server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. \n\nOther winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. \n\nOur server was really fantastic. Friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.\n\nWe used to actually go off the Strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now Maestro's in Crystal Center will be the go-to. \n\nIf you have only ONE good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here."

The location of this restaurant is in the crystals shopping center which is a little bit of a disappointment.  We dined in the tree house which was beautiful but the view of people shopping and the mall did take away from the ambiance, thus the four stars. I am a sweet wine type of girl and had the moscato, which was so smooth and sweet.   For an appetizer we ordered the scallops which were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. For our entree my husband ordered the chicken and I ordered the bone-in rib eye.  The Ocean club is the sea food version of their traditionally restaurant but offers many of their beef variations.  Most of the appetizers are seafood options but they offer their regular sides with additional seafood options. The mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were great as always."

My experience was no different.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant is housed in a cool modern treehouse.  On the inside, it's what you would expect from your typical fine-dining establishment.  The service here is attentive and accommodating.   They pay attention to detail by offering a black or white napkin depending on your attire. \n\nThe food?  Perhaps some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Let's start with the bread basket.  It was mixed with a variety of carb-loaded treats.  Olive focaccia, soft pretzel, etc.  \n\nWe ordered the Spicy Mambo Salad and the Ocean Club House Salad for the table.  Both portions were very generous and each is enough for an individual meal.  Both were delicious but have their own individual personalities.  The Spicy Mambo Salad has no protein and is reminiscent of a caesar salad with hints of wasabi.  The Ocean Club House Salad had bits of lobster and shrimp and were well balanced.  We also order a side of macaroni and cheese for the table.  The \"side\" was huge and plenty for a table.  In fact, we had some left over for a party of seven.  Again, delicious.\n\nFor my entree, I had the 12 oz. filet.  I ordered it medium rare as I normally do.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender to the point that I could have peel off pieces with only my fork.  It's arguably the best steak I've ever had.  A friend order the sea bass, and unlike other fine-dining restaurants I've been to... the portion was huge.  The sea bass had a lightly seasoned crust and super white in color throughout.  It was flaky, yet melted in your mouth.  This was by far the best sea bass I've ever had. \n\nThe reasons I didn't give Mastro's five-stars?  Three reasons.  First, the waiter seemed to have a little attitude when one of our guests requested separate checks.  And second, they had a band playing there that night.  I'm not sure if this is a common nightly play.  But, I'd rather not listen to a 70's - 90's cover band while I eat a fine meal.  Lastly, I couldn't overcome the fact that every time I looked around... I was still in a retail shopping center.  I love views, but not that of shoppers walking in and out of Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc."

We weren't bothered at all by the wait, but we were still given glasses of complimentary champagne--and we were treated to the restaurant's signature Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  I have absolutely no complaints about the delay in getting seated.  Mastro's handled a difficult situation appropriately, and in my opinion, went above and beyond for myself and the other guests that were also seated late.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went all out for dinner and ordered the seared ahi appetizer as well as the Hamachi with Fried Onions.  Please, oh please make sure you get this.  I've never seen anything like it before.  The perfectly fried onions melt on your tongue like butter, and the hamachi was perfect.

We talked about it at the restaurant, as we were leaving the restaurant, while we were next door at the Aria casino, on our flight home, and ever since we've been back home.

We set up dinner reservations for 6:30 prior to a 9:45 flight that would get us the hell out of Vegas; while it wasn't the best idea in terms of timing, we were just super eager to eat at Mastro's and couldn't cram it in earlier in the trip.\n\nWe were seated in the middle of the big floating wooden structure, which was excellent for the view and being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the restaurant (something I really like). Our waiter was excellent; he made us feel at ease and happily answered all our questions about ordering.\n\nThe first order of business? A nice bottle of wine. Fortunately, they had several wines in the $60 range that I like and pair nicely with both fish and meat (keeping our options open :-) ). We chose the 2009 Grgich Hills Merlot, and sat around merrily sipping until our starters came.\n\nThe Seared Albacore with Truffle (see the picture) was really damn good. I could have eaten two plates of that and been happy. The Tuna Tartare was good, but not amazing. Yep, I've dinged it for \"not being amazing\". We went in all different directions for main course: one bone-in steak, one cooked fish dish, one sashimi tuna dish. All were excellent. The sides were excellent. Everything was excellent. See a pattern?\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the main course we ran out of wine and unconsciously ordered another! Why not go out with a bang.\n\nThe hour was winding down, our stomachs at near capacity, and fears of the implications of missing our flight creeping in, yet we got dessert. The Warm Butter cake. Dude. Best part of the meal. Might have been the best part of the weekend. Don't go without it.\n\nThanks Mastro's for an awesome dinner. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."

            "review": "Tried Mastro's for the first time on Saturday while staying in Vegas. Made a reservation on Yelp (super convenient and easy) for 5:15pm. Ended up coming 15 mins late because of traffic but was still seated right away after we arrived. If you do plan on coming here, leave about 30-40 mins (depends on traffic also) early since you do have to park/valet then walk into Crystals Mall located at Aria.\n\nAppetizer - Tried the calamari and I would have to say I have had better. The calamari was reallllllly chewy. Some might prefer that but I don't believe calamari should be chewy. The only reason why it was enjoyable was the creamy sauce that came with it. I could eat the sauce by itself. It was THAT delicious. As a high-end restaurant, I was expecting better calamari, but Flemings and Ruth Chris both win on that dish.\n\nEntree - Bone-in Filet and Bone-in Ribeye. The Filet was amazing! It was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. I usually get filet without the bone but decided to try something different and it did not do me wrong. The bone-in ribeye was good but not as good as the filet. It was soft in the center but the outside was too blacken for my taste. It was over-charred and slightly burnt in corners. Probably wouldn't get that again.\n\nSides- Lobster mashed potatoes.... WOW! Such a genius idea. $39 side... so you will expect something amazing and it was! So flavorful with lobster pieces in each bite. I will definitely get this again. Cream corn - nothing that stands out from other cream corn I have tried before. Though, I could tell the corn was cut from fresh corn, rather than using canned corn - which was a plus. \n\nComplimentary bread - variety... probably 4-5 different types.\n\nService - from a 1-10, I'd give about 7.5. Server wasn't as personable or attentive.\n\n1 appetizer, 2 sides and 2 steaks came out to be $188."

            "review": "I would rate this more of a 3.5.  For starters, the decor and architecture of this restaurant is absolutely breathtaking.  Based in the center of a classy mall, the treehouse area has a unique and interesting view of everything around you.  We went around 9, so no one was really shopping and the mall was pretty bare. I felt like I was in a different world!  For a Monday night the restaurant was hardly crowded and we were seated immediately at a table of our choice.  The complimentary bread was interesting, although there were several pieces that were extremely hard to bite into, I enjoyed the soft pretzel-like bread the most.  For drinks we tried the lemon drop and the cantaloupe martini.  Both very awesome, and the cool thing is that they come with the martini shaker, so you end up getting two drinks really.  I enjoyed both drinks, the cantaloupe one tasted like sweet cantaloupe but strong enough to get you buzzed.  As for the lemon drop, it was soooo cool - they put some kinda sizzling dry ice or something in it so it looked like a volcano when it came out.  I sat there in awe for like 2 minutes just staring at the smoke come out of my drink! Then sipped on it and got buzzed 10 min after hahahhaha.  \n\nAs for the entree, we ordered the rib eye medium rare, macaroni and cheese, and creamed corn.  I'm sad to say but I wasn't too impressed with the rib eye.  I felt like it was cooked in fire too high - the bone was completely charred.  Even though the inside was medium rare, the outside had bad burnt areas all around it.  And since we shared a plate, they brought out another plate for me, but it was soooo hot that when we put food on it, the oil kept splattering on me!!!  I mean granted it was a nice gesture, but I did not like how bits of oil kept splattering on my nice dress!  So anyhow, despite the slight disappointment in the steak, the macaroni and creamed corn TOTALLY made up for it.  The macaroni came out in a sizzling pan where the cheese would not stop ooozing when you tried to take a spoon full of it off....just the way I like it!!! I couldn't stop eating the side items that I probably would have rather eaten those as my meal rather than the steak itself!\n\nAnyhowl, I dont know if I'd come back for the steak, but I definitely appreciated the view, side items, and drinks.  Our bill came out to be $110 for 2 drinks, 2 side items, and 1 rib eye.  It was what we were expecting for a steakhouse at this caliber so not surprised.  I rounded up on the rating only because between the two of us, we shared the leftover mac and cheese and creamed corn the next day and still were satisfied :)"

            "review": "Mastro's to me is just another steak house. Just like Fleming's or Morton's and Ruth's Chris, Morton's offers a very classic steak restaurant. Visiting Vegas, I made a decision I shouldn't have made. Not to say that going to Matro's Ocean Club inside the Shops At Crystals was a mistake or a bad experience. I just have a dining out rule when I'm in Vegas. \"If there's one in LA or OC, don't go there.\" Well, I broke my rule, but it was all for a birthday celebration. I figured, I probably won't be going to Mastro's anytime soon, so might as well. And the bird's nest really attracted me. I was really happy with my decision for the most part.\n\nWe started things of with bread service. They offered pretzel, crouton, baguette, dinner roll, and wheat bread. The breadbasket had variety all were quite good. My favorite was the pretzel -- it was soft and airy.\n\nI had some of the Caesar salad to start. I needed some kind of greens to soak up all that meat juice. Their Caesar salad was near perfect. The dressing was nice and creamy. The addition of parmesan cheese and cracked pepper made everything better.\n\nI was ready for the main event, the 22oz bone in rib eye. The rib eye is one of my favorite cuts because of the even fat marbling and soft texture. Mine was cooked perfectly medium rare, though a bit more on the rare side. This actually caused the meat to be a bit tough. This cut did have some nice fat running through the steak. This helped with the tenderness and mouth feel of the meat. Even though this wasn't the best steak I have had, the help of the amazing sides made it all better.\n\nThe real reason I came here wasn't the steak. Well it is, and it isn't. The real reason I came here was for the lobster mashed potatoes. I mean. It is Mastro's Ocean Club -- Ocean, meaning seafood is in order. This side dish was rich as can be -- full of butter. I believe the potato to butter ratio is near 1 to 1. With a whole lobster tail carefully chopped up and placed in a pool of butter, the potatoes were creamy and flavorful. The pure essence of the sea was encased in butter, and mixed with potatoes. Eating this with steak was pure bliss. The kid in me wanted to order the mac and cheese. made with gorgonzola, the flavor was very rich. Another cream heavy and dairy heavy dish, the mac and cheese was delicious. My favorite was the layer of melted cheese on top.\n\nMy favorite was dessert. We were celebrating a birthday, so they gave us a chocolate birthday cake. The cake was rich in chocolate and eating just a few bites was enough for me. The best thing about this dessert was their home made whipped cream. Served on the side in a bowl, the homemade whipped cream was so dense and fluffy. The cold cream and the chocolate cake was a perfect mixture. Honestly though, the whipped cream was the best thing ever. I wanted to take it all home.\n\nEating at Mastro's Ocean Club was a great experience. The location is a bit awkward. As you are enjoying your expensive meal inside an amazingly architectured \"bird's nest,\" you look out and you see people shopping. That is cool and all, but you can't help but think you are inside of a mall -- Well, you are inside of a mall, and this Mastro's makes sure you know that. I couldn't help but think I was at a very glorified food court at a mall. When I eat at a nice establishment, I want to feel secluded from the world. I just didn't get the at from here. The food is great, though as far as steakhouses go in Las Vegas, you can do a lot better. I guess I can only break my rule once. Never eat at Las Vegas where you can at home."

Service started out good but before we even got around to placing our order they were already falling flat. No drink menu or wine list for starters and to go along with that no wine recommendations. I guess if you don't want us to order wine, 1) don't give us a menu, 2) don't mention what pairs well. Service got obnoxiously slow after we ordered our food, so bad that one of our party went and lodged a complaint with the manager. The only saving grace on this visit was the food. Everyone seemed to enjoy their plates. I ordered the filet, which came out wonderful and cooked perfectly. For what they charge here, everything should have been dialed in, it's unfortunate that we didn't have the same experience so many others were able to enjoy."

If you get 3 stars then there must've been something wrong. \nFirst of all I was really into going to eat here. I thought it was really nice on the inside. I had a very positive attitude without super high expectations. That's the ideal right? \nWell, I was here for my wife's birthday, and my sister in laws belated birthday dinner. I ordered bone in rib eye. My wife ordered bone in filet w lobster tail on the side and my sister in law ordered lamb chops. I ordered mine medium rare. It came out just under well done. My wife ordered hers medium and it came out well done. My sister ordered hers medium and it came out rare. The manager happened to come by and ask how everything was. I really want to avoid complaining at a restaurant, but my wife said his is too done, and my sisters is not done enough. I said hey it's alright we can handle it, but the manager said oh no please let me take care of this. Ok I said no problem thank you so much. So they started another steak for me and started to cook my sisters more. Ok so they brought mine back. It looked right on the outside...nice looking. Alright so it was practically raw. My sisters comes back and it looks like they threw it in the microwave. All the while it's my wife's birthday and her steak is brown. Wtf. \nSo I cook a little around the house. Some say my steak is better than most restaurants. I usually say it's ok. Well, in this case I can say I can get the temp on the money 90% of the time without timing it. I really was kind of shocked. I won't go into the meat anymore because it really was a train wreck. \nThe appetizers were good. Dungeness crab cocktail, and oysters on a half shell. Drinks were great. We all enjoyed. But the dinner was really one of the worst I have ever had. I am really bummed about that. I can't really rate it a 1 star because the manager was good, appetizers were good, drinks were good, but the dinner...well, never again. I almost want to bump up the 2 stars that I have given on other reviews because this review is really 1 and a half."

After reading about Mastro's, I made a reservation, and we were seated in the large wooden structure thing. Screw it, I'm just gonna go straight to the steak.\n\nWhen our waiter mentioned that their special was an A5 grade 33oz. wagyu tomahawk, I was sold. It's basically a thick cut, bone-in ribeye, and I knew I was in for something special just by looking at it. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was the rim - it was HUMUNGADUNGA. Normally, the rim just encircles the outer edge of about half the eye, but this rim was almost the same size as the eye! Why is this such a big deal? Of all the steak cuts, the rim of the ribeye is the absolute BEST tasting piece in the entire beef carcass. I always separate it from the rest of the ribeye so I can save it for last. The muscle fibers in the rim are very loosely bound, and marbling of ribeyes is second to none. What this means is that you have a piece of meat that's super tender (just as tender as a filet), super juicy, and super flavorful, which perfectly describes the wagyu tomahawk. Each bite was a blast of rich and savory goodness. The juices coat your mouth in a sheen of happiness. There truly is nothing to criticize. The only thing I could wish for is that they serve just the rim as its own cut of steak.\n\nThe next time you're in Vegas, forget the crappy frozen king crab legs at the buffets, and treat yourself to something really worth the trip and big bucks."

I did not care for the horseradish/mustard type sauce though, but I think that was just my dislike for those types of condiments. \n\nI ordered the 12oz filet medium rare. It had a beautiful seared crust that was crispy and not burned. The inside was so perfectly tender juicy red and melted in my mouth. The texture of the two was perfect. \n\nFor sides we had the baked potatoe which was huge! But was the least appetizing item all night. The Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was delicious! I don't tend to like blue cheeses or very much cheese, but this cheese goodness was Devine. I enjoyed it so much I'm going to try to remake this this week for dinner! It was served in it's own skillet and was more than enough for myself and my two othe dinner companions. \n\nWarm butter cake. What can I say but order this! I usually love tiramisu and cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e but mmmm this cake was so moist and had a crunch sugar top under the vanilla ice cream. The cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e was actually disappointing.

They werent too loud and the music was a good mix, classy good sounding modern and hit music, not clubby like stk. you wo t leave with a headach and sore throat.The atmosphere of the restaurant was light and elegant. I didn't mind that it was located in the crystals. Honestly I liked being able to walk around while we waited for our reservation we made through aria, our hotel. If you do have a bit of a wait go down stairs to the little water tornadoes. They are touch sensitive and you can control how they spin!"

Disappointing....I love when the butter cake is perfectly warm with the cold ice cream. It just wasn't as amazing as it normally is! It was my first time at this location and I'm not sure I will come back. I also just didn't love the atmosphere. Mastros is normally very sultry and romantic.

On this Labor Day Weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by Shauna, our Culinary Captain Extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  Turns out... our \"Terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.\n\nShauna introduced us to Mastro's participation in \"Las Vegas Restaurant Week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-Square Food Bank in Southern Nevada.  She offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by Beefsteak Tomato & Onion Salad, an 8 oz. Petite Filet, Creamed Spinach & Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Key Lime Pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  \n\nAs there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and Shauna's recommendations. She perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful Riesling, Cabernet, and Sauvignon Blanc.\n\nSooo, included in the culinary delight were: The Legendary Seafood Tower (Ohhh YES!!), Lobster Bisque (best in class!), Herb Roasted Chicken (delightful), New York Strip (absolute perfection), Chilean Sea Bass (sweet & outa this world), Saut\u00e9ed Sea Scallops (Oh Yeah!), Creamed Corn (buttered and seasoned to perfection), Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms ( a fav of favs), Roasted Brussels Sprouts (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. Baked Potato (huge), Triple Chocolate Layer Cake (nothing but delish), AND...(drum roll)... the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake!!...once again to die for!!!\n\nWithout fail, and to paraphrase the writings of T. Scott Gross,... Mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  Shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  It doesn't get any better!"

The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  \n\nWe made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. \n\nThe table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic! \n\nI started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!\n\nIf the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.  \n\nMastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  It was surely a memorable evening!"

It does get a bit loud and the view is of a shopping mall.. a high-end shopping mall, but still. Not my ideal view for a such an awesome spot. It is what it is though!\n\nThe room itself is very nice, lots of seating, lively atmosphere, great looking staff. I have been a couple of times now and the service is always great when I have gone and the food spectacular. \n\nI have ben to Ocean Club a couple of times, but this most recent visit was a dinner of 'Dungeoness Crab Cocktail', 'Ribeye' and '10 oz Ahi Sashimi' . We shared everything with a side of sauteed spinach .. and a few martinis. :) I loved was the personal style serving from the individual pans that the food items were seemingly prepared in. The service staff has always been very pleasant and makes the experience very comfortable. \n\nThe Ahi was fantastic with a really beautiful presentation laid out on a long plate with a finish of a really tasty sauce. The ribeye was prepared expertly, perfect medium rare with still  a beautiful grill flavor. The spinach was .. spinach, sauteed.. but was excellent nonetheless! haha.. I was having such a great time and enjoying the vibe of the place overall. \n\nThere was a piano player in the corner of the room playing standards and old-school vegas tunes.. Sinatra and the like. It gave a beautiful feel to an elegant style dinner. My friends and I aren't the most refined diners, but we know how to have a good time, and Maestro's made us feel welcome within that setting.\n\nNow don't get me wrong... this ain't your downtown steakhouse with a $4.99 steak special.. you WILL drop a pretty penny to have some seriously tasty grub.. but I do believe it's worth it.  At over $150 a head when we dined there last, it was worth the money but definitely be ready for a big bill. It's nearly unavoidable. \n\nHave a great time, and happy eating!"

We booked the private rooms upstairs for a reception and sit-down dinner for a party of 40 on Saturday, September 15, 2012 and our discerning guests who came from all around the country could not have been more pleased with the entire experience.  We were expertly guided from start to finish by Carly Smith, Director of Events. Carly was assessable, professional, flexible and an essential resource regarding local vendors to compliment the comprehensive services offered by Mastro's.  The ambiance was charming and elegant... photos of the gorgeous chandeliers, golden leather seats and flat screens which are viewable on their website, do not do this venue any justice.  We were in full view of the delightfully lit Tree House and even the restrooms which came with very courteous attendants, were a pleasant surprise. Their technology is also top of the line. All we needed to do was bring our slide show on a flash drive and our iPad playlist and our music soared through the rooms and our slideshow displayed brilliantly on two flat screens. Mastro's provided all of the equipment and cords and made it easy for us to make our party truly surround sound fun!  No event is a success without delicious food and this is where Mastro's clearly shines brightly. We started with an extraordinary Seafood Tower and Brochetta during the reception. Guests could not get enough of the Colossal Shrimp and Split/Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs and the wait staff kept everyone's wine glass full which added to the fun and excitement during the reception. As we moved into dinner, the asparagus tempura seemed to disappear from the tables as guests ordered their choice of salads and entrees. And, talk about entrees...the generous portions of prepared-to-order salmon, chicken, steak or sword fish provided additional shock and awe. Even the side dishes, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, saut\u00e9ed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. In addition to Carly Smith, we also have the highest praise Sherie Ritzler, General Manager, Brandon S., Banquet Captain, as well as, L.R, Alex and all of the wait staff and hostesses."

He also didn't hover too much, which is appreciated. \n\nOur table started with calamari and an order of one of the day's selected oysters. The calamari was incredibly tender, the oysters were excellent too - the delicate cucumber flavor was exactly as described by our waiter.\n\nFor our main course, I had the arctic char oreganata (prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs) and my companions had the special wagyu and Chilean sea bass. For sides, we split the gorgonzola mac & cheese, sauteed asparagus and creamed corn. \n\nI'm deducted one star for the slightly underseasoned sides and for the ridiculously large portion sizes. My arctic char, while delicious, was enough for three meals (no, seriously, it was a pound of fish), and the sides were also much larger than you would expect at a restaurant in this price range, which can significantly limit the variety of sides you can try if you're dining in a party of 5 or less."

I don't appreciate my waiter giving me attitude just because I don't know half of his fancy schmancy expensive food vocabulary.\n\nWe got there last Friday at around 730 PM. The waiter went over the menu with us and began taking order. We didn't know what kind of cooking style we want on the fish. When we asked him questions, instead of him answering patiently, he decided to just give us THE LOOK and say \"i just went over all the cooking style with you..\"BLAH..\n\nThe food was salty and whatever.. \n\nI don't understand why he's giving me attitude if I still have to pay him tip.\n\nI'm gonna save that money for a nice purse next time."

            "review": "We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. We had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the sea bass to the bone-in steaks. This is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. Here's the breakdown:\n\nBread basket - GOOD. Normally, I'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and I was already starving, so I had to put something in the stomach. I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! So soft and slightly warmed.\n\nLobster bisque - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). Rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!\n\nSeabass - good and buttery. It was a big serving size and I only finished probably half of it.\n\nBone-in ribeye - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.\n\nLobster mashed potatoes - I'm not really a fan of mashed potatoes and these were okay. Small pieces of lobster mixed in.\n\nSea Salt & Vinegar Fries - pretty good! Nice little break between bites of our main courses.\n\nCreamed corn - pretty good! Nice side dish without being overpowering.\n\nThe food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, I expected a lot more. They either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: What kind of steak house is this?!\n\nThe service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.\n\nWould I return? Probably not."

The warm butter cake portion was more than enough for the three of us, served with a drizzle of berry coulis, sliced strawberries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top, and, in a separate bowl, enough whipped cream to frost a double-layer cake.\n\nMy first spoonful filled my mouth with warm brown sugar-sweet goodness, with the cake texture somewhere between a Genoise and a pound cake. The cake was wonderful on its own but we couldn't help but top our tastes with the whipped cream. We were so full from our meals (most likely due to that extra order of pretzel rolls) that, sadly, we couldn't quite finish the warm butter cake.\n\nI plan to return for an all-carb meal next time: pretzel rolls and warm butter cake!"

It's probably due to the fact that I LOVE SEAFOOD!!!\n\nI was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that I wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  Instead we ordered the following:\n\n*Seared Ahi Tuna - (just as good as the first time I had it in OC)\n*Sauteed Sea Scallops - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  AMAZING!!!  I just found out I'm moderately allergic to scallops but I love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. SOO YUMMY.\n* Chilled Alaskan King Crab Claws - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  Loved it.  Way A lot more tasty than shrimp cocktail or lobster option.  \n\nThis was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a Chilean Sea Bass for my entree since my favorite fish are chilean sea bass or cod anything.  I'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, I decided to order it pan seared.  It came out nice fluffy and buttery.  I ordered it cooked medium.  I really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.\n\nTo be honest, I couldn't enjoy it as much because I was so stuffed!  I really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but I guess I'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  I will definitely come back :)"

The Dungeness crab was a bit salty. (I mentioned it to our server, he admitted they boil it in salted water. I felt they should dial it back. Dungeness is briny on its own. I suppose it's okay to put it in a lightly salted water for preparation. But maybe it was a bit much?)\n\nThen for the final blow: Kobe beef with foie gras and lobster mashed potatoes. Yeah. Stick a fork in me. I was sick with regret a half an hour later. But I did enjoy it! The steak was perfectly medium rare and so tender I nearly didn't need a knife. Truly amazing."

I really liked the pretzel bread and the cheese crisps. Our server brought out our drinks, The Paloma i ordered was excellent, not over powering but had wonderful refreshing grapefruit flavor.\n\n I ended up ordering the Oysters Rockefeller, Clear Lobster Roll and the Alaskan King Crab Gnocchi with Black Truffle. My boyfriend got the Chilean Sea Bass, wedge salad and saut\u00e9ed asparagus. The oysters were juicy and full of flavor and honestly this was the best gnocchi I've ever had. It was rich and was full of crab and truffle. The lobster roll was okay, had good flavor. My boyfriend's fish was cooked perfectly and almost tasted like lobster. It went well with the asparagus and gnocchi.\n\n Our plates were cleared and Megan brought out a dessert menu, we were way too full for dessert. However, she brought us out a little pair of chocolate covered strawberries with fresh whip cream for a little sweet treat on the house! Service was impeccable, our water glasses were always full and we were definitely catered to. Megan our server made our experience a wonderful one, I highly recommend this place for a special occasion, it's worth every penny!"

Located in the Crystals mall just outside the main entrance to Aria, sister restaurant to Scottsdale & Beverly hills' location. we embarked on night one in Vegas.  So let's start with the drinks at the Piano bar a very nice opening where a piano man and gorgeous singer belt out a few tunes prior to dinner where we were seated in the Tree house so to speak.  Bright open and airy we were treated service wise very nicely.  8 Tonight and waiters and staff were brisk and efficient.  The standard push for bottled water well you get the drill. A High end steak house and fish place that needs no preamble.\n\nGreat Start bread basket with Pretzel breads and such excellent! \n\nI'll run it down.  Shrimp cocktail is a highlight with the dry ice making the fog come off the shrimp it's an eye catcher.  Asked for horseradish on the side oh boy the hottest dam thing I've ever consumed. one drop in the sauce made my dry stuffed nose wince and my head was cleared like a nitrate ammonia pack from my football days. Yea baby it was good! A lobster cocktail was also equally outstanding.  Multiple salads were also ordered and shared from a Chopped house salad, a Cesar salad and beefsteak tomatoes & Mozzerella.  Skip the last one. \n\nEntrees: 7 Steaks one piece of fish.\nEvery single steak was absolutely delicious From the bone in filet to the strip to the bone in KC Strip there were outstanding. One was cooked or shall I say undercooked and the handled it not only by fixing the dish but removing it from the bill.  The Hawaiian big eyed Tuna was horrible only way to describe it. Sorry but another get this out of here moments. \n\nSides: All very generous in size and easily splittable among the group 4 sides way too much for 8 people.\nLobster Mashed potatoes a die for moment outstanding\nSauteed mushrooms yummy\nGorgonzola Mac & cheese another to die for moment\n\nCreamed spinach excellent.\n\nAll and all a fine dining experience with the drawback of a couple of 1 undercooked steak and one bad entree both removed from Bill make this a nice experience."

Boyfriend made reservations here for our 8 year anniversary on a Saturday evening, requesting to sit inside the \"treehouse\" that everyone on yelp recommended. They even called him the day before to confirm if we were still coming. \n\nWe arrived about 5 minutes early and the host immediately had an \"oh crap\" look once we gave her the name for our reservation. She said if we wanted to sit in the treehouse it would be a 45 minute wait.. I was so upset because we made reservations almost a month in advance and the fact that they called us the day before to make sure we were still coming... Whatever\n\nWe didn't want to wait the extra 45 minutes cause we were starving, so they sat us at a different table. \n\nWe ordered cocktails, which were really good and strong! We got crab legs as appetizer and they were really fresh, I liked the cocktail sauce that came with it. We decided to share the bone in filet because we didn't want leftovers because the hotel we stayed at had no fridge, they were kind enough to split this for us. We also ordered scalloped potatoes as a side. The steak was okay, a little too salty for my liking. The potatoes were still hard, I wish we got Mac and cheese instead. Even though we split the steak we still couldn't finish it, we ended up taking it togo along with the potatoes. \n\nFor dessert we got the infamous butter cake and it was delicious! They put and candle and wrote happy anniversary, which was really sweet of them. When the check came I noticed that they charged us for the anniversary cake, I was reading other reviews that people got their dessert comped?! Anyways, overall I'm not sure if I'll return, at least not this location. I'm still bitter that they couldn't accommodate our seating arrangement for our anniversary."

If you are not on death row or in prison, you should definitely make a trip and try it out.

Just like the one in Beverly Hills, this place had outstanding service! Honestly, it has better service than the one in Beverly Hills. Our server, Tanya, was amazing. She kinda resembles Chelsea Lately but way prettier.. anyways she was very accommodating even though she was busy with other tables. I was impressed by her. Since it was my birthday, we got a complimentary dessert of my choice and I chose the warm butter cake. It is so delicious. We got escargot for an appetizer following our main course which was a rack of lamb with a side of creamed spinach along with a sushi tower which consisted of hamachi sashimi and clear lobster roll. Every single thing we ordered was simply delightful and at times, I wish I can go to Vegas just to eat at this specific location of Mastro's. Because it's Vegas, it is a little more crowded but the ambiance still reflects an elegant and classy environment. Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club for making my birthday memorable :)"

That is an open covering cavelike to soften the views of the Mall as it is located in the Crystal Mall in City Center. Crazy. Most of us ordered steaks and Calamari for an appetizer. The appetizer took FOREVER to appear! Ok, forgiven because it was excellent. Moving on. The steaks, for the most part, were fine except for one which needed less raw. Yes, I said raw! All side dishes are a la carte, so sharing is a must. The dinners are served on near bare plates with no presentation at all, so whatever. \nAll in all, not bad, but for the price a little bit more effort is in order. I will say our server did her best to cover up the mis-steps and I appreciate that effort. Unfortunately, she should not have to."

The food was delicious, but my experience was tainted due to the way the management handled an issue.\n\nThere was a couple sitting directly behind my husband and I, and the woman was visibly drunk. Slumping in her chair, etc. Finally, she throws up to the side of her table, which is about 2 feet or less from my chair. The smell is horrendous and I quickly flag over a waiter and tell him the issue. \nHe gets a manager. I explain to the manager what has happened and he asks if it's the end of the meal or beginning. I say end, but we have dessert and coffee coming. He said \"what would you like to do?\" I thought it was obvious, but I start laughing and say, \"I'd like a new table please.\" \nHe escorts us to a new table and says \"You know, this is completely beyond my control.\" \n\nI'm aware of this. I haven't yelled, complained, or blamed anyone for the situation. The drunk woman is STILL slouched in her chair, STILL vomiting, and I'm being moved by MY request without so much as a, \"I'm sorry\" or \"I hope this hasn't ruined your experience.\" NOTHING. Then, the manager says he will tell our waiter that we moved. \nThe waiter comes up some time later and says \"oh, I see you have moved tables\" We proceed to explain to him what happened since the manager didn't, and we finish up getting our coffee and dessert and settle our tab, while the woman still sits there and the puke remains. \n\nI wasn't looking for anything really, except maybe a simple apology on behalf of the restaurant that let a woman get increasingly drunk and throw up so close to me. Instead of a choice like \"please let us move you to a better seat\" I was asked what I would like to do....and then the only words spoken to me were \"You know, this is completely beyond my control.\" AND nothing was explained to our waiter, so we had to wait until he found us. Poor management and I don't think I should be made to feel guilty for asking for a new seat away from puke."

Made a reservation a day in advance asking for preferred seating for the occasion (ample notice, for sure).\n\nOnce we arrived (15 minutes early),  we were seated in between the bar and main floor hallway that allows the food runners/waiters to run in/out of the floor.... Asked the hostess to accommodate us better than this and all we got was \"this is the best table I have, sorry!\" shouted behind her at us as she walked away. \n\nMeanwhile, the floor was, at best, 70% full. Not looking to complain, we just sat down and hoped for the best. Our waiter was a tall, bald, emotionally disconnected guy who seemed to be running through the motions of serving. Never got his name, but he warmed up towards the end of the service. \n\nBeing as it was our anniversary we simply wanted to be left alone with our food yet know our server wasn't too far away, so this did the job I suppose. \n\nWe ordered the $55 steak filet (after the waiter talked us OUT of the $125 Wagyu beef we requested, as if we couldn't afford it....LOL), the lobster mashed potatoes (eh...), lobster bisque (stellar-not hard to mess up, however), and the Smoked Salmon (forgettable and way too salty). \n\nWe went for the clich\u00e9 Butter Cake for dessert and it didn't disappoint- however, we were so full from the bisque we couldn't finish. :( sad faces all around. \n\nFor a high-class restaurant, this one was filled loud and obnoxious diners (one table next us was revoltingly drunk and hollered at every female who walked past us) and another across the restaurant was the same but thankfully far away. Management seemed to just let them yell their heads off as long as they ordered more booze- hmmm. \n\nIn all, nowhere near a 5-Star experience. Not a 4, either. These would require more personable and attentive service, as well as regulation of rowdy diners. It's Memorial Day weekend, not Fight Night or Cinco de Mayo. No excuse. \n\nThe three star wasn't a two because our food runners and water/bread guys were awesome and always there to refill and clear away dishes, the steak filet was incredibly prepared and the sleekness of the restaurant's design helped us forget about out shoddy table. \n\n\nMaybe next time, Mastro's."

I had never expected to take the plunge at Mastro's in Vegas, as I have been eyeballing its SoCal locations for years but never had set foot inside.\n\nThe verdict? In the overall spectrum of Las Vegas steakhouses, Mastro's was superior to Craftsteak but a significant step down from CUT. \n\nThe high point of the meal arrived early in the form of the seafood tower, which was over-the-top but fantastic. In short, the seafood tower here crushes the one at Oceanaire. It's the best reason to have dinner here.\n\nThe low point of the meal was my filet. In fact, in an unexpected turn of events, I left feeling as though I should have ordered the salmon instead. Like everyone else at my table did. As for wine, order the duck horn merlot. \n\nSurprisingly, another underwhelming aspect of the meal were the sides. Mastro's take on mac and cheese was a bust compared to CUT. The lobster mashed potatoes were a let down too, especially given the hype and eye-popping price tag. As a salad, I had wanted to order the caprese, which generally is a favorite of mine. Our server talked me into the heirloom burrata instead, which I regretted doing after tasting it.\n\nFor dessert, the chocolate cake sounded like the best choice after skimming the menu, but turned out to be dry. The better option was effectively donuts with ice cream. Neither, however, were good enough to recommend with much enthusiasm."

Although it's basically a restaurant located in the middle of a shopping mall (albeit an upscale mall), it is a very pleasurable dining experience. The food here is incredible. The lemon drops are fantastic and entertaining as they are served smoking and bubbling. Excellent wines on the wine list. The filet here is magnificent. The truffle lobster gnocchi is out of this world. The side dishes are excellent and feed about four or five people. The warm butter cake is spectacular and is served with a huge bowl of some of the best whipped cream we have tasted. Unfortunately, one of the people in our party ordered the crab cakes and was disappointed with them as she thought they were over seasoned and almost tasted as though they were seasoned with poultry seasoning. The last time we ate at Mastro's Ocean the service was tad bit better, but compared to the poor service that we've been receiving lately, the service was outstanding. Did I mention the live pianist? Some of the people in our party thought they were listening to some recorded Billy Joel music and were surprised when they found out that it was actually a young man playing the piano."

            "review": "Went to Mastro's before a show. Scott was our server and was excellent. Had a full dozen oyster's on the half shell which were just out of the ocean fresh and delicious! I ordered Sea Bass blackened and it was melt in your mouth perfect! The lobster mashed were delish as was the house dessert, Warm Butter Cake, served with loads of fresh homemade whipped cream! Servings are large and we all had leftovers. Loved sitting in the treehouse. We do have a few suggestions: The entrance is so boring and the piano is shoved way back in a back corner that you would never notice it. How about putting the piano up front somewhere? Such a wonderful restaurant needs a a better first impression. Also, we had called and asked for a 7:30 reservation and were told it was not available but 8:30 was. That was too late for us to make our show, so reservationist suggested 7. We arrived and were seated at 7 and the restaurant was no more than half full until past 8 pm!! So why couldn't we have come at 7:30 as we first asked? I mentioned this to a manager who approached our table mid-meal  and he said, \"Well, sometimes things change.\" HUH??? Terrible response. Nevertheless, we loved our dinner and the service was fabulous. We can't wait to go back. We're already saving up!"

The table we were assigned was not one we liked and they had no problem letting us sit beside the balcony instead... I ordered the oysters on the half shell and even though the month of July has no r in it, they tasted extremely fresh. Their horseradish is amazing! For an entree I ordered the scallops. I have not ordered scallops in years because it's such a difficult food for restaurants to really have fresh but this was a worthy choice. My partner is vegetarian and her sides were homemade mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts and asparagus. Everything was so good that we forgot to leave space for dessert... Even the complimentary bread was irresistible. Thanks Mario!"

Some had seafood while others enjoyed the signature steaks Mastros is known for. Also the cocktails were great.

Steak is the reason that this rating is 4 stars instead of 5.  We have had far better steak at Craftsteak. But the side of mushrooms that you can order with the steak is sooo good!\n\n4.

First, we had a reservation, and came about 15 minutes early so we could grab a drink at the bar first. We checked in, but were not seated until about 20 minutes past our reservation. Not a big fan of having to wait that long past the reservation time. Second, I'm not a big fan of the dress code. It's supposed to be fine dining, and it is a beautiful restaurant. But, the fact that you see customers simply wearing t-shirts and jeans kind of ruins the whole thing. \n\nOther than that - all was dandy. Service was impeccable, but I would hope so considering the amount you pay to eat there. \n\nFood wise - we got oysters as appetizers. They were very fresh and tasted great. The clam chowder we ordered was decent, but nothing to rave about. I've had plenty of other clam chowders that easily beat the one at Mastro's. The steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and were complimented well by the sauteed mushrooms. \n\nSince it was my birthday - they did give us free chocolate cake, which was nice. Very light, fluffy, & moist. BUT, we did also order the warm butter cake, which I think most would agree is a must. Man, the chocolate cake was nothing in comparison. \n\nOverall, great place. Would definitely go back again, when I have the money to spare. \n\nAnd on a completely random note - they do serve Chilean Sea Bass at this establishment, which surprised me. This fish is known to be highly over fished and is on Seafood Watch's list of fish to avoid. Just thought I'd let you know."

Love the ambiance, menu looked great, have heard great things about other locations so we decided to make this our last nights meal in Vegas.  Glad we did because aside from Mix, and JR's this has now become one of our favorite places in Vegas. I would not hesitate to recommend. \n\nSeated in the main dining area right in the middle of the coolest structure for a restaurant you will ever see. Warm dining room, very welcoming as were the staff. Ours were a attractive redhead young lady and a younger guy.  Piano playing jazzy christmas tunes, nice touch.  Immediate introduction by the servers, it looked as if there were two for every table. We started with the house special martinis, served chilled and shaken at the table and blended perfectly. Really, perfectly.  Scanned the menu,  server came back by to check on the drinks and announced the specials. Decided on the following:\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Sea Scallops\nWarm Spinach Salad\nChilean Sea Bass\nNY Strip w/o bone\nLobster Mashed \n\nScallops arrived, great presentation. Now I love scallops, being in the PNW we have lots of choices on seafood and some of the best scallops I have ever had are at the barking frog near the Woodinville winery and home of the famous Herbfarm. These were excellent, large but not too, perfectly seasoned and prepared. All sitting on tip of the most wonderful cheese bread cracker in a wonderful sauce. Yum! \n\nSalad arrived, again great presentation, just made, plate warmed just enough you could smell all the ingredients. Now this was key. Onion, egg, bacon and greens all perfectly aligned to emit this wonderful fragrance that just made your mouth water.  None of the heat or tartness you sometimes get with places putting too much red vinegar on the greens.  And the taste, I shit you not this was the best salad I have ever tasted. The senses alive with the fragrance and the taste perfectly aligned. \n\nSteak and bass arrived, simple but elegant in preso.  Bowl of steaming potatoes with over a pound of lobster and a beautiful sauce. Steak done to perfection, one of the best cuts and flavors I have had. And I am a steak house freak.  Steak was severed still sizzling on the plate, little bit of butter on top on a simple white plate.  Wife's Sea bass was served equally as elegant. Simply in presentation, nice cut of fish perfect flavor.  \n\nService was just right, friendly, genuine there when needed. Asked the server to choose a wine for me to pair with the steak. Perfect choice came back again.\n\nI don't work for this place, wish I owned stock or had ownership though. This was by far one of the best dining experiences we have had all year. We will be back. \n\nThanks to the wonderful staff and happy holidays!"

Mastro's is quite the experience -- from the structure itself, to the wondrous items and their presentations, to the exceptional and classy staff.  You salivate as you picture-perfect dishes being carried by.  \n\nThe seafood tower is a spectacle - double tiered dish with dry ice smoke surrounding it.  I have no idea how the waitstaff can carry that giant concoction.  It came to the table and shocked us at first sight.  The shrimp were the size of my fist, the crab legs were monstrous, and everything was overwhelming.  If you can eat after that appetizer, then hats off to you!  \n\nAs luck would have it, I was crazy hungry, so I went for the 22 oz Bone-in Ribeye.  It came out on a plate sizzling at 400 degrees.  Perfection!  Medium rare to the T.  That was the second best Ribeye I've ever had (first being V&A).  I wanted to pick up the bone and start gnawing.  \n\nSomeone else got the Halibut cheek which also looked very unique and delicious.  I really wanted to order it.  Alas, as a Texan, Ribeyes speak to my heart (on so many levels?)  \n\nThis is definitely one of classiest places that I've been to.  What an upscale Vegas experience."

Our server was a gentleman by the name of Eric Baily, and I use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. He was amazingly attentive.  Our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. Everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. We also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, Luciana, I may have spelt that wrong :(. She had a radiant personality.  They offer a great cocktail and wine list. We tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had Duckhorn Decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so I had to try it. The bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. There was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy. \n\nThen of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. Judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. We had a chilled lobster cocktail and oysters on the half shell for starters. Seriously...amazing oysters...I am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. The lobster was also great. For our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....I know because I touched it, even after I was warned not to ;P Perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. My lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of Maryland for some time. Yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. I guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. Again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors."

When he arrived at 720PM, it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there. The hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar, enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us. \n\nDuring our 30 minute wait (yes maybe they were short staffed, not ready yet etc.... which I am ok with) they sat multiple tables of walk-in's and a few reservations of small 2-4 tops. (I know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others I over heard when I stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table. Off to a bad start..... \n\nAnyway, we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant. All the back-waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full, serving the bread, clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc... (After working in this industry for years, I get picky about this crap at high end restaurants) The server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us. (Yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant, I am ok with that)\n\nOn to the food, below is a list of what we ordered and what I thought about it: \n\nCalamari App: Lightly breaded with light seasoning. Dipping sauce complimented it very well. \n\nFillet Mignon: Very tender and medium rare is more of rare. But it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it. VERY TENDER, cut with your fork status. \n\nSea Bass: Parmesan crusted.... a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors\n\nCream of Spinach: Very creamy and just was not my style. Girlfriend liked it though.\n\nSea salt/vinegar fries: These shoestring cut fries were epic! Yes.... of everything I ate, I was most impressed by the large basket of $10 fries. \n\nWarm Butter Cake: Once again.... this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me. :)\n\nMultiple layer chocolate birthday cake: Now to be honest, this was what saved Mastro's from getting the dreadful 2-star rating from me. In my reservation, I had noted \"birthday\" but no one had seemed to see it. Hell, we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake. Personally, did someone at the hostess stand go oops! We need to send a birthday cake over to Table XX immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert? But to be honest, they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one. \n\nOverall Mastros.... maybe I set my expectations to high and I understand, you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out. In the words of my girlfriend, it was not as good as the Crystal Cove, CA location yet on par with the one in Costa Mesa, CA. \n\nSounds like I have to try all this again at the Crystal Cove location and compare! Granted.... thanks for the last minute birthday cake. It was nice to see those little comments on Open Table actually mean something."

Shockingly horrible food experience we had for our pre Christmas dinner last Sunday. I do NOT recommend coming here. I can't believe we paid $270 for a mediocre meal... what a disappointment. Fail Mastro's Vegas! Again, I highly, suggest spending your money somewhere else. The one star that I gave them was for, Dalan, our awesome server. \n\nNow, I have been to Mastro's in OC about a dozen times and it has never failed me but in Las Vegas it was a major let down. What happened?! If anything, I expected more out of the Las Vegas location. We ordered:\n\n1. Shrimp cocktail\n2. Wagu 8oz. Steak $98\n3. Gorgonzola mac and cheese\n4. Creamed spinach\n4. Creamed corn \n5. Key lime pie\n\nThe shrimp cocktail was the best thing my boyfriend had, served with their house cocktail sauce. The Wagu steak was cooked medium but was the texture of a pork chop. Unlike the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness they boast of. The Mastro's in OC  Wagu steak was cooked to perfection so I have something to compare it to. Fail Mastro's Las Vegas. The Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was missing salt, it was rather bland. The creamed corn was a bit watery, unlike its usual creamy consistency. The corn was also mushy, probably over cooked. That is always a favorite but they seamed to mess that one up too. The creamed spinach was rich but tolerable. Aside from the shrimp cocktail and key lime pie, the dinner was meh.\n\nUpdate: 5/24/15 \nMastro's reached out to me shortly after our visit but I somehow missed their attempt. After four months of not seeing their message, I immediately called back and spoke to the manager last Saturday. He apologized for our experience and told me that the GM would give me back a call on Sunday... Well, a week later and I hear crickets. No missed calls or messages. Nothing. Wow, this is an even bigger let down. The second fail requires that I update my review... Mastro's kitchen, staff (ie. Management) clean up your act.  I'd take away that one star if I could."

I have to say that I was disappointed with food and felt it wasn't worth the money.   We were a party of 4.  Started off with the tuna tartar tower and escargot.  I thought they lacked flavor.  I've had better at other places that are not that expensive.  My daughter had the gnocchi with Alaskan Crab as a entree.  She enjoyed it.  My son and BF had the Petite filets 6 oz and 8 oz.  They were tasty but again nothing special.  I had the twin lobster tails.  They came out cold and were flat and just ok.  The sides we had were basic Garlic mash and asparagus.  I informed the waiter about my lobster and he gave us the butter cake on the house.  I thought that was nice.  But then again heard that it was amazing and I didn't think so and happy we didn't have to pay for that.  Our server was nice enough but nothing special.  Guess my expectations were to high."

SO I think more than half or our party of 10 did just that.  Also, the sides are served family style.  We had several different sides & all were delicious.\n\nJust to let you know about the service.  I ordered the bone in filet medium and when I received it, it was bordering on well done.  When the waiter came back to the table (within a couple of minutes), he noticed that I was not eating and asked if there was a problem. I informed him that the filet was overcooked for my taste and he immediately picked it up and said he would bring out a 18 ounce (I had a 12 oz).  I told him that he did not need to do that, but he insisted.  \n\nIt did not take long for me to get my filet brought back out and this time it was perfect.  He apologized again.  I didn't think I could eat all of it, but after the first taste, I realized that I was not going to let this go to waste.  \n\nIf you go here, I would for sure get a reservation.  Also, be prepared to spend about $60 - $80 per person.  \n\nSide note, one of our friends in the group had a birthday, and he was treated with this delicious chocolate moist cake.  I mean it was terrific.  It came with a big bowl of whipped fresh cream.  \n\nIf you are in Vegas, you need to try this place out.  I have eaten many steaks in Vegas, but this one has been the only one that has satisfied me.  \n\nDress code is business casual, but I am sure if you wanted to walk in with shorts and a t-shirt they will take your money."

From being ushered into the beautifully unique wooden architecture aka the \"Treehouse\" that housed the restaurant, to the exceptional service and, being, overall, treated like royalty, my party of three had pretty much felt that we had eaten at the best restaurant in Las Vegas. \n\nNestled aesthetically inside the Crystals at the City Center besides Aria Hotel, Mastro's was incorporated within the shopping center, in the midst of luxury brand names: Vuitton, Zegna, Cartier, et al. The most striking feature of the restaurant was how the interior of the restaurant is actually built into a structure that resembled a treehouse skeleton, with no solid walls in the main dining room. This monstrosity emerged from the ground floor and grew at least eight stories into the air and eventually flowing symbolically into the ceiling. \n\nThe dining experience was superb. Highly attentive, the staff reminded me of 3-Michelin star restaurants but at much lower prices and with sense of humor that made it fun and even more memorable. The maitre d', well-dressed in a fine suit, was always attentive over the entire dining space like a hawk and was quick to address diners' requests. Our waiter was especially quirky and cracked a few tongue-in-cheek jokes that were appropriate for our young, lively group.\n\nAs for the quality, it was on par with most upscale restaurants. Steaks were delivered in juicy perfection. The incorporation of seafood into potato dishes were noteworthy, especially the crab gnocchi and lobster mac and cheese. There wasn't anything else the chef could've done to improve these dishes.\n\nThese were the items selected by our table:\n\nAlaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ***\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts **\nLobster Mashed Potatoes ***\nBone-In Filet ***12oz\nFilet ***12oz\nGorgonzola Mac & Cheese ***\nClam Chowder **\n\n*   don't bother\n**  average/good enough\n*** exceptional\n\nNot realizing that we had ordered more than enough food for our small party, we opted to take the rest home, which the waitstaff briskly took care of and within minutes, returned with all of the food packaged in their own individual black to-go boxes with the Mastro's sticker label affixed to the top and neatly arranged in a shopping bag. \n\nBathrooms were supplied with an assortment of items found in medicine cabinets had personal effects like Tums, men's cologne and mouthwash and someone to hand you a paper towel to dry your hands with. Again, Michelin-star quality without the Michelin-star price. \n\nBest $350 spent in Vegas. Worthwhile for a beautiful night out to impress your significant other, client or, perhaps, to just have the best fine dining experience in Sin City."

Seriously.......\n\nI went for a company dinner so cannot attest to the price (although based on other Yelpers, the cost is quite steep!)  Started with a lovely bread basket with a wide variety of different breads, including \"pretzel bread\" which is quite similar to Joe's Stone Crab bread.  The bruschetta appetizer came next which was VERY oniony, but it's a good thing I'm a big fan of onions because I absolutely loved it.  Caesar salad was just so-so.\n\nThen the main course....I got the mahi mahi in this fancy butter sauce which was excellent, but not as good as my husband's salmon (I almost stole his plate it WAS THAT GOOD).  The fish portions were very large and filling.  Sides for the table included creamy mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  The spinach was a little salty for my taste, but not grainy at all.\n\nDessert was cheesecake with whipped cream and berries which was creamy and decadent...A+ even though I was completely full I ate the whole thing.\n\nWould I return to Mastros?  Absolutely.  Wonderful ambience and GREAT salmon.....after all it is an \"ocean club\" so the fish has to be good right?  Cheers!"

Mastro's is a well known stop for those looking to treat themselves. \nFood: We went as a group of 7 girls and all got steak with a variety of shared sides. I split a 16oz filet made medium (almost half the price it would cost to get an 8 oz filet on your own). It was everything I expected from a good steakhouse, well seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked. Its only dressing was a melting slice of butter on the top. The sides were all generally well made. The lobster mashed potatoes had real chunks of lobster it in, though, between the 7 of us, not everyone got a piece. The brussel sprouts and asparagus were cooked to just the right texture but there was nothing really special about them. The creamed corn was sweet and luxuriously smooth but needed a little more savory to balance it out. \nService: The service was excellent. The server was very accommodating and attentive. A few of us ordered steaks to split and they plated them separately for us. We also brought in our own cake since we were celebrating a birthday. They served the caked and repacked the leftover cake for us to go. \nLocations: Mastro's unique architecture has made it a near icon among the casinos on the strip. Floating in the middle of Crystals, it makes up a beautiful view and provides one. The decor is subdued in an elegant way and it generally draws a quieter crowd.    \nWhile Mastro's wasn't a life changing dining experience, between the high class menu and eye catching locale, it certainly did not disappoint."

At the price they sell main courses ($35-$60) which includes no sides at all but just a piece of fish or meat is ridiculous as even then it's just a piece of meat - no interesting garnish or sauce even on the plate. \n\nThe quality of the fish was ok but we too don't live on the coast and the fish at our local Whole Foods is as good or better than here. Also their beef was just that - ok but I know our local store sells as high of quality. \n\nWas pissed that this place charged $20 for an heirloom tomato salad and served it with the tomatoes cold as if straight from a fridge. Who the hell does that? The tomatoes should be stored at room temperature anyway and I certainly don't want a cold tomato salad. Weak and almost embarrassing for the restaurant. \n\nThe vegetable sides are about as generic as you can get and available almost anywhere. Brussels sprouts, green beans, garlic mashed potatoes -  not interesting nor were they very good. \n\nNot sure if their high ratings come from people that live way outside a major city or maybe in live the middle of the country where chain restaurants are the only option but this place was downright shameful for the price and for the generic food preparation. Almost like they have no head chef running things but just an expediter slinging out the same old stuff every day and never thinking to change or improve things. \n\nBill was around $120/person. No problem if it was an amazing meal (or even above average) but again I could've cooked it better at home for 1/3 the price. \n\nI guess this restaurant will keep cashing in on people don't who know any better or want the most simple uninspiring food on the planet."

It was romantic yet there were large groups around that worked well too. There was a piano man right next to the bar area that took requests all night.

So, if you order a bland grilled dried swordfish, that's it, that is all you get for $40 on a large plate.  Presentation in the food was not there for a so-called high-end restaurant.  The blackened scallop was so salty that it was difficult to eat it.  We celebrated our birthdays there and got a very dried complimentary chocolate cake.  We did order their signature butter cake also, and that was decent.  But, for $16, we have definitely tasted much better for less.  Overall, the ambience is nice.

Victor is a great bartender and the service is wonderful. As with all Mastro's, the wine list is incredible and goes on and on. Tonight was a Darioush Cabernet starter night as I pondered this wonderful menu, trying to stay light and healthy, amongst some decadent alternatives. \n\nEventually, I decided on a starter of Jalapeno Tuna Sashimi which is ahi tuna\nsliced sashimi style, topped with fresh squeezed key lime juice, thinly sliced jalapenos, and ponzu chili sauce. This is light despite looking like a lot of chili sauce. \n\nNext, a salad of beefsteak tomato and onion with balsamic was a refreshing without being super oldtime steakhouse heavy! \n\nFor an entree, I ordered another small plate: The lobster cocktail which is 1.25 pounds (including shells). Now after eating all of this, I have slowed down and am just enjoying my wine when a couple of friends show up and we decide to end the evening with the crab claws which are excellent.\n\nWhat an incredible meal, great services, great music and very relaxing."

We all split a ton of apps and sides, and finished off with butter cakes for the table. Food coma heaven! \nThe only thing lacking was the atmosphere. (Why I knocked off 1 star) we were expecting a loud, energetic \"Vegas\" style restaurant (much like the one back home here in Chicago) But it was very quiet, bright, and just low energy. More suitable for a quiet dinner with your significant other, not a crazy group of 8 guys and 2 girls lol. But hey maybe that's the feel this Mastros is going for, which I can totally appreciate."

I felt like they could handle anything we threw at them.\n\nThe food was amazing and all the meats just melted as we ate them. The portion sizes available were very appreciated since the group had various (stomach) sized people. Cooked to culinary perfection, we had a meal to remember for the rest of our lives.\n\nThank you so much."

Everything was flavorful and prepared perfectly.  I had a bone-in Ribeye.  It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.  It was not the best steak I have ever eaten, but it was up there.  The drinks are aggressively poured (for what they cost, they certainly should be). Dessert was equally impressive and the attentiveness of the wait staff was some of the best I have ever seen.  The dining experience as a whole was in my top 5.  I very strongly recommend this place if you are seeking a top notch dinner in las vegas.  That said, be forewarned that it is also in the top 3 most expensive dinners I have ever had.  The entrees are not really that exorbitant, but when you tie in a side like lobster mashed potatoes for $40 and multiple alcoholic beverages, it gets expensive in a hurry.  Although expensive, the entire experience makes it worth every penny."

Tasty and of course buttery smooth with a slightly crunchy/crispy crust. The bowl of whip cream on the side was massive and well appreciated. Overall a good dessert but not great. The Caramel Bundino from DOCG and the Toffee Pudding at Gordon Ramsay steak easily demolish this offering however. Nice service and vibe though."

I started with a long list and ended up, with Mastro's. And, it was the perfect setting, to celebrate our anniversary. \nWe travelled all morning. Checked in our hotel and walked all over the strip, during the day. So, we were a little tired, by dinner, but were up, for celebrating, with delicious food and wine.  \nWe had a table, in the \"treehouse\".\nWe ordered a bottle of The Prisoner wine, because we were splurging. It was delicious, and went well with our meal.\nThe bread basket they brought out was this bread lovers dream; huge, wide assortment of yummy goodness, with butter. \nWe had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cakes were very large, and scrumptious, with not much filling, just lots of crabmeat. \nThe Lobster Bisque was very nice. \nWe shared Blackened Scotch Salmon, which was delicious, but thankfully, not huge, cut in half. The lobster Mac 'n Cheese side is sinful. \nThey brought us a complimentary dessert, for our anniversary. We were able to squeeze in a few bites. \nThe service was as you would expect, in a higher end, very nice restaurant. Our waiter and all the staff were courteous and helpful. \nWithout the $100 bottle of wine, the meal was still pricey, but it was worth it. This is a great place to celebrate something/anything!"

We were seated immediately and i think they gave us white or black napkins, which they placed across our laps for us, based on what color we were wearing. And that was just a hint of the level of service to come. We had a very attentive server, but someone in a suit, his supervisor (?) was also constantly checking on us. My water glass was never empty, a standard I use to base a restaurant's level of service. I had gotten up once to use the restroom and accidentally dropped my napkin. As I was leaning over to pick it up, our server appeared out of nowhere and immediately insisted that he would do it. When i came back a fresh napkin was folded at my seat. When the sides came, someone immediately offered to serve them to us. I was surprised no one offered to cut my steak...lol. The restaurant quickly filled up, but from the time that we were seated until we left, never once did the superb service lapse.\n\nOk onto the food: There were a few different types of bread and i think I like most of them. They refilled our bread basket, but I wish they didn't lol because I ate way too much bread. I ordered a berry flavored cocktail and it came in a martini glass, but they also set down a shaker cup by my glass, and to my delight, there was enough to fill my glass a second time! =D We ordered the steamed mussels appetizer and they were delicious, so fresh, not fishy at all. Just delicious. I could have inhaled an entire order myself. Everyone ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. So, so good. We were trying to be kinda healthy so we got sauteed mushrooms and spinach and creamed corn as sides. But afterwards I wish we had gotten the mac & cheese and the truffle gnocchi. Everything was so delicious and the portions were pretty big. I ate about a third of my ribeye and we didn't even finish all of the sides. Luckily our hotel room had a fridge so we could take the leftovers. \n\nIt was definitely pricey, but for the amazing service and food, I think it was well worth it. I would definitely go back or at least go to one of the SoCal locations. Mastro's is the standard by which I compare all steakhouses and other fine dining establishments to."

To my surprise, my hotel is literally across the street from the place. \n\nWe get to the place at 11:30pm and the hostess tells us we're closed and we're bummed.  Bummed because we're scheduled to leave tomorrow and wouldn't have the chance to try it.  We begged to just sit at the bar and see if they would let us order dessert. She said sure...YAY :)\n\nGot to the bar, looked at the menu and the bartender said you have to try our signature dessert dish and we said ok but we're here for one thing and he said the warm butter cake and we were like YES!!!!!\n\nWhen it came out it was sooo beautiful.  To cute to cut!!! The cuteness didn't last long.  We took our first bite and OMG...decadence!!!! It was mouth watering. It was fabulous.

This place has more of a casual setting to it but most people will dress in their casual Friday attire.\n\nThe food was great.. very similar to the food at Beverly Hill location but because of the Ocean Club name, they have more fresh seafood at this location.. I still think that Mastro's excels in steak so unless you don't eat beef, why would you order anything else?\n\nAlso, I recommend that you make reservations to this place. When I went, they were not busy (they had like 6 parties dining), they insisted that they were. Make sure you specifically ask to dine in the Treehouse. This is the middle part of the restaurant that overlooks the mall. Anywhere else, and you end up close to the piano, and the piano's volume can get overwhelming.\n\nAll in all, Mastro's in Vegas is a good steakhouse. But because of it's prices, I expected it to be a little more on the personal and upscale level. but the fact that it's in the mall makes it seem like they are a more casual restaurant with high prices. I personally prefer the Mastro's in Beverly Hills. If you are a local to Vegas, definitely give this place a try. All of you that did the 4 hour commute to Vegas, drive back and go to the one on Canan in the 90210."

Also he suggested the lobster mashed potatoes as a side and sushi roll. \n\nThe steak was good, but too big for both of us to finish. \nThen the server hands me the charred bone bit - actually, more like plop it in the mashed potato - and tells me to eat the meat off of it. Really? Are you expecting me to lick my fingers off after I chew off the meat with my teeth and hands like a classy lady?\n\nWe opted for half portion lobster potatoes instead of a full, which was still a whole bowl of potato mash swimming in a pool of butter. Whatever happened to mixing?\nThe half portion of sweet potato fries had so much breading that I couldn't taste the sweet potato. I'm sure there's a lot of people who drool over this type of side dish, but I was certainly not one of them.\n\nI'll give 4stars, but next time, please don't suggest ordering extra food when it's clear we can't even finish one plate. It's too good to waste!"

A short trip to Vegas and we needed a place to dine- so Mastro's Ocean Club was the choice for the evening! When we made reservations, we asked to be seated in the treehouse- what a cool ambience! Bread basket was super yummy but pace yourself- don't want to fill up before that delicioussteak gets to your table! Orders at the table included: Mastro's salad, filet mignon, shoestring french fries, baked potato, side of mushrooms, and the sauteed asparagus. All were delicious! All 3 of us had the filet and it was perfectly cooked and DELICIOUS. Can't wait to go back! We were so full but had to have dessert so ordered the butter cake and we were not disappointed. I'm not a huge fan of cake but this was one of the best desserts I have ever had. Great service and great food!"

The oysters were alright but didn't really impress me either . I had the bone-in filet mignon which was absolutely heavenly !! It was so yummy and literally melted in my mouth !! Their filet mignon is perfect ... the best I ever had !! The cream of corn made the perfect side . It was very delicious . They also carry white muscat wine which was good . It came out to be about $100 per person with the muscat wine including tip but it was totally worth it . I will definitely be back here again the next time I am in Vegas !"

I only ate one chop and took the rest to go. The seared tuna was a huge let down too. Also, we didn't receive a complimentary desert for our anniversary despite receiving well wishes from several members of staff.

The hostess was very sweet. The ambiance of the restaurant was great, and it's located right inside the mall. \n\nService was great from our waiter and he was very attentive and helpful. My only issue was that when our server was busy and we tried to call someone over but even though other waiters were around and saw our flag down we were totally ignored. \n\nOur food came timely, the spinach and scallop was delish! My only issue was that there was a hair in my lobster mash. I let the waiter know and he kindly took the mash away and asked to replace it. The replacement was delicious but I was already turned off with that hair. \nThat's why I took one star away. I felt that if I'm paying $300+ for a thanksgiving meal, it should come with high quality food, good service at all times, and that doesn't include hair in my food. I requested my steak to be medium well but it was definitely very rare. The meat was under cooked for my taste, and they were nice to recook it but it just took two times for them to make it right. & I'm reallly not a picky eater. It just sucks that the time they spent recooking in sitting there watching my party enjoy their meals. \n\nAll in all, I was dying to try this restaurant and had high hopes for it.. but I would not come back because of the high price tag and the service/food was not worth the $$"

Seated in the neat tree house, Shady and Co. started with some seared Ahi tuna, well presented and delicious. Shady and lucky guest split the bone in ribeye and the crusted Halibut special and side of roasted sprouts. The steak and brussel sprouts were spot on. The Halibut was a touch disappointing, undercooked in spots and with no real oomph in the flavor. The dessert had to be the signature warm butter cake. Big enough for 8, Shady and friend got 1/3 through and called it quits. The creme fraiche was outstanding and the cake as good as advertised. But why so huge? Service was very good, and the vibe very enjoyable. Shady always have reservations ordering fish in Las Vegas, and next time will stick with what Shady thinks is their forte-the meats. 3.5 stars."

The tomato and mozzarella salad we shared wasn't memorable. In fact, for burratta mozzarella it wasn't good at all. I thoroughly enjoyed my bone-in filet which made up for the salad. The side of mashed potatoes was decent but not outstanding, same goes for the side of peas we shared. Mostly we went because the location was conveniently close to the Aria, where we stayed, and because after seeing the tree house on a previous visit to Vegas I desperately wanted to eat there. Being in the tree house wasn't the best experience. It's loud, since you are in the middle of the Crystal's mall. All in all, it was decent but overpriced in my opinion. I probably won't be returning to this Mastro's location."

As per my request, they were able to save us a table inside the tree house near the edge, so we had a nice view of the architecture around us. Our server Sam managed to be attentive and informative without being too intrusive and asking us how the food was every few seconds, which I thoroughly appreciated. \n\nUsually I don't talk about the bread basket, but this one was pretty good. The bread was warm and soft, but waay too much for two people. On to the main courses: the rack of lamb was tender, juicy, and perfectly medium rare..kind of wish there was a bit more seasoning though. The bone-in ribeye was just as tender and more to my liking, although the outside seemed pretty charred...\n\nAfter we were done with the mains, we barely had any room left for dessert, but I kept reading reviews for the warm butter cake, so we ordered it to share. The cake came with a HUGE helping of whipped cream on the side and a big scoop of ice cream on top...naturally, we couldn't finish it and asked to have it wrapped up. The cake was moist and the layer of crunch outside from the caramelized sugar was great, but overall, it was too sweet. =(  \n\nWe definitely made a good choice coming here. The food and service was all really good. Will definitely try to come back again next time we're in town."

There didn't seem to be much of a dress code and the steak (Ribeye) was too fatty for our taste. We didn't want anything lean, but this was too fatty. The best side to me was the creamed corn and the clam chowder soup was the highlight of my dinner. I will say it was my first time having clam chowder. The ambiance was not exciting at all.

Having been at the Mastro's in Scottsdale, we knew what to expect: tasty appetizers, good drinks, and even better steak, so we were excited to check out this location.\n\nThe restaurant itself is in a unique setting: inside the high-end Crystal mall in the ARIA in a wooden tree house sculpture - pretty unique! I will say that having dinner while being able to look out at the Fendi & Louis Vuitton store did seem to downplay the high-end feel of this restaurant and it made me really annoyed (I know, hater) at all the women walking around with their Chanel & Prada shopping bags.\n\nWe were promptly seated outside of the tree house in the booths and as usual, service was second to none. They were aware of the gluten-free dining note on our Open Table reservation and brought me the Gluten Free Menu which is pretty large and almost mirrors the regular menu with a few exceptions and some alterations.\n\nLarge signature cocktail, beer and wine menu - I liked that they denoted which cocktails were gluten free as this is usually a place in the gluten-free menus restaurants ignore. Stunning and colorful bar - my husband liked the large selection of craft beers as well. The two TVs flanking the bar though did seem out of place.\n\nFor a starter, the shrimp cocktail is a great choice: presentation is really cool with the dry ice vapor, the shrimp are HUGE and the sauce is good. For an entr\u00e9e, I went with the filet. Instead of their regular rub which contains gluten, they will season it with salt & black pepper. It was a huge portion (had I known, I would have ordered the small filet) and it was cooked well and they even did a butterfly cut to ensure it cooked through. I also ordered a side of green beans with sliced almonds - tasty & fresh however, there were no almonds... \n\nOur waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of checking up on us despite a busy Saturday night.  He was even nice enough to bring out some chocolate covered strawberry with whipped cream on the house to celebrate my husband's birthday which was even more thoughtful because he made sure it was a dessert I could eat given my gluten-free diet.\n\nWe had an awesome time, with superb food and drinks and top of the line service. Would highly recommend for a nice dinner, but be prepared to spend at least couple of hundred dollars on this indulgence!"

The server greeted us and informed us of the daily specials. We ordered the calamari (yuummm) and a mojito (don't order it, you won't miss out on much, tastes like Sprite with a hint of mint). The drink however, will not affect the way I will review our main course and service. My husband and I both ordered a filet for dinner with a side of scalloped potatoes and asparagus.... The asparagus was fresh and cooked to perfection. The potatoes were packed with flavor. You won't be disappointed with the potatoes. Lastly, the steak.... WOW. The steak was cooked to order and very delicious. We enjoyed our dinner at Mastro's aaaaand were very thankful and appreciative of the complimentary warm butter cake dessert that was given to us to help us celebrate our anniversary. \n\nThe excellent food, attentive and friendly staff, establishment design and atmosphere make for a enjoyable dinner experience.

We happened to be in Vegas for our anniversary, so we decided to have dinner there as our celebration.\n\nBecause this place is located at the City Center right in the middle of the mall, so it doesn't carry the same kind of \"exclusiveness\" as the one in Costa Mesa or B Hill.  Dress code is also easier, only required hotel casual, so shorts and tees are welcome.\n\nJust as mentioned by most, the staff are extremely polite and friendly, that was a great start already.  We got seated fairly quickly and our waiter brought us the wine / cocktail list quickly.  I asked for the Mastro's Mojito cocktail, which is rum with lime and mint.  It's not very strong and I like it a lot.\n\nWe were aware of the portion at Mastro's, and since my wife is pregnant she can't eat too much.  So I asked the waiter if it's OK for us to split the steak and allow us to try more other dishes.  They were very understanding and said absolutely no problem at all.\n\nFor appetizer, we went ahead and ordered the sauteed scallops.  We were both very very impressed with the dish.  Three gigantic scallops, all prepared and seared to perfection, and the sauce was awesome together with the bread.  It was very rich and good.\n\nWe also ordered the lobster bisque, and they went ahead and split the soup between two bowls for us, that was very nice.  The waiter also came and helped us split the scallop appetizer on our dish, that's great service.  We also tried the pretzel bread together with the soup, they all paired together very well!!!!!!\n\nMy wife particularly loved the lobster bisque.  She commented that a lot of times the lobster bisque she has is way too salty, but the one we had was just right.  Very smooth and rich in lobster flavor, but it doesn't get overpowered by the saltiness.\n\nFor steak, we ordered the bone-in 18oz filet and we asked them to split a small portion for my wife (medium well).  Mine was cooked medium rare.  It was simply fabulous.  Meat was very tender and juicy, and even my wife's portion, though cooked medium well, was still very tender.  \n\nAnd I have to say one of the most important thing they did right was resting the steak well before serving.  Most of the time when I eat steak, by the end it was juice all over the dish.  But not this time, all the juice was retained inside, that was awesome.\n\nWe also got the lobster mashed potato as side dish.  It's good, a lot of lobster as stated by others, though I agree with my wife, while it's good, for $36 bucks, it's basically lobster mixed with mashed potato.  It doesn't have that \"specialness\" in some sense.\n\nSince it was our anniversary, they gave us a big chocolate cake.  It was BIG, and it tasted really good too!\n\nAt the end of the day, we were impressed with the dinner.  It's not cheap by any means, but for special occasions, the quality and quantity of food?  I think it's worth it.  Although part of me still wonder how the experience would differ if we were to go to the one at Costa Mesa."

Very spacious with plenty of seating area.\n\nI've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. In fact, I think I'm even more impressed each and every time I go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. \n\nService: Impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. I've had a light skinned African American male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing I should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. I've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. \n\nFood: To die for. The best bone-in ribeye I've ever had. I've tried quite a few steakhouses in Las Vegas (ribeyes because I am obsessed) and none compare to Mastro's. Their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! I've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, tuna tartare, lobster mashed potatoes (a must try), Gorgonzola mac and cheese, king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and the brussels sprouts (gotta have some veggies).\n\nWine: They have one of my favorite Cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, Chateau St. Jean. Highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.\n\nDessert: Do the butter cake. Comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. Sweet, warm, and delicious!\n\nI love this restaurant. Writing this review makes me want to go there this week. A perfect 5!"

Both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. But that's not all.\n\nIf you make an Open Table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. One of the times I've been to this Mastro's Ocean Club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if I would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which I found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. Regardless I told her I would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time. \n\nYou're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. Every time I go to Mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. If you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.\n\nMy reccemondations as far as Mastro's Ocean Club in Las Vegas?\n\nBone-in Fillet\nBone-in Ribeye (although the Filet wins my money by a mile)\nAlaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi\nLobster Mashed Potatoes\nGarlic Mashed Potatoes\nOcean Club Salad\nAnd their Raw Oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh\n\nIf you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. Yes it is just that good.\n\nHope you guys enjoy it as much as I do. After writing this review, I'm just vying to go back."

Our waiter was awesome and very attentive. Now to the food. I ordered a rib eye and asked for it medium well (which has a little pink inside.) It came well done and I didn't have the heart to complain since it was a $59 steak and sending it back would mean they would have to make a whole new one. It was also pretty flavorless. Boyfriend ordered lobster tail and in his exact words \"best lobster tail I've ever had.\" I'm glad he felt that way since the rest was just ok. Our scalloped potatoes were very salty, but the creamed corn was pretty good. It was $200 for just the two of us."

She was very nice. She even checked-in my coat.\n\nI love the restaurant ambiance, not too loud and not as cramped as the Beverly Hills location.\n\nI love the different bread choices.\n\nWe started our dinner with escargot, which is really good. I love the flaky bread that came with it. We ordered mac and cheese, rack of lamb and bone-in filet. This is not the best steak I've ever had but my steak was done perfectly, medium rare which I asked for. My husband loved the rack of lamb. Lamb serving was huge, he got 2 racks. Mac and cheese was ok. They didn't have porterhouse here not like the Beverly Hills location, since their specialty is seafood.\n\nWe had a great dining experience!"

First Mastro is in the middle of the almost new City Center construction project and mausoleum for the lost profits of Dubai and the MGM Group.  It is a really nice place filled with shops people can no longer afford.\n\nMastro from the outside looks like a brown tree house in this glitzy cloud.  It is a really beautiful build out with a long and a two dining areas, one in the tree house and one outside said house.\n\nIt is a traditional steakhouse with tons of cuts of cow cooked to your liking and ubiquitous sides:  4 different types of spuds, veggies, etc.  I do not eat steak, but most of these places will have one chicken dish and really decent seafood.\n\nI ordered the salad, scallops and split the sweet potato fries.  The salad was huge and could have/should have been the meal, especially after the  box of 6 kinds of different breads.  The scallops really excelled with a Parmesan flavoring, but the hit was my friends Arctic Char, which was perfect....and I mean perfect\n\nWhere is there fish that good in a desert?\n\nThe waiter was excellent and goaded us into dessert.

After visiting Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. Mastros, of course, had the same effect.\n\nOur party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:\n\nA dozen oysters (Kusshi and Bluepoint). All were delicious but, personally, I prefer the smaller Kusshi.\n\nThe ahi tuna tartare was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.\n \nOcean Club crab cake. There was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.\n\nThe scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. The accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.\n\nThe 22 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. A solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.\n\nAlaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. A little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. Pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.\n\nAlaskan king crab legs. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. Each yielded plenty of tender meat.\n\nThat was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. It was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. It came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. I was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. The flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. As delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.\n\nMastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the Strip. The atmosphere isn't the greatest either. It is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. There's no dim, mood lighting. Just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. The tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. We sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.\n\nThere was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. I had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like Aubrey O'Day. I didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.\n\nI'm not sure how this Mastros compares to the ones in California that people rave about, but relative to Vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. It's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake."

No Vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   Located within the Crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of Strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.\n\nWe had the works.  A bottle of Pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment I've seen.  Two salads: Caesar and a Wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  And then....drumroll....the entrees!  Juicy, thick bone-in ribeyes for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  And for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo sea scallops sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few Parmesan-crusted crostinis.  Crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as I might, I couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  Wonderful side pairings of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms to share.\n\nAbsolutely no room for dessert.  It was a fantastic meal."

It is located on the second floor that looks like a wooden Aladdin lamp.  \n\nThe ambiance was great.  It was comfortable, cozy, and had live music.  The food was pretty awesome.  I ordered the cowboy ribeye cut bone in steak.  It's the second largest steak on the menu.  It is probably by far the best cut of steak I've had.  It was tender, soft, and juicy.  The potatoes au gratin was alright.  Next time I am going to try the lobster mashed potatoes.  The bread they serve is pretty impressive.  You actually get a bread basket full of different assortment of bread.  There is pretzel bread, wheat, white, bread sticks, and others that I can't recall right now.  Tasted like it was freshly baked that day.\n\nThe service is the reason why I gave this place 5 stars instead of 4.  Our server was outstanding.  He was pretty knowledgeable about the food.  Helped me make up my mind on what I want right away.  Didn't give me too much info where it would confuse me (it doesn't take much to confuse me).  He checked up on us every now and then to see how we were doing on our meal.  He asked if we wanted to order dessert.  We declined because we were stuffed like a turkey at a thanksgiving dinner.  So we politely asked for the bill.  So our server brought us back a raspberry sorbet with our bill.  It was on the house and and he said he couldn't let us go without having dessert to complete our wonderful meal.  How cool was that!? I am not a sorbet fan, but I still take a few bites cause I'm a fatass.\n\nI recommend to go and enjoy the food, but I will return because of the service."

Based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. We ordered Blue Point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. The sauteed scallops were absolutely to die for. It comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  Then we ordered a filet, the sea bass, lobster mashed potatoes and Gorgonzola mac n cheese. While still very tasty, each item had some issues.  The lobster in the mashed potatoes were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  The mac n cheese had no hint of Gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  The filet was good and perfectly cooked, but I've had much better steak elsewhere.  And last, the sea bass wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as I expected. \n\nThe service is great. Everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. Our server was super busy but she checked on us often. The ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. It's really loud and not intimate at all. You're very close to other tables.

However, I was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak.  I felt like I was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff!\n4.  Here's the moment of utmost disappointment.  I was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail.  It was not warm and fluffy as I remember.  It was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy.  The wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.\n\nConclusion:  For being open for 6 months, should I expect it to be where its other Mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should I expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line?  Regardless of kinks or not, I'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other Mastro's experiences.  Mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation.  Will I go back?  For the love of butter cake, I will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.\n\n[side note: If you do try this particular Mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it.  I think you will get better service.  It seems as if the table we were sitting at is a \"blind spot\".  The servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]"

I also shared the lobster mashed potatoes and it was probably the best mashed potatoes i've ever had as well. It was super creamy and the lobster was cooked perfectly.\n\nI came here w/ a group of 20 other guys for my friends bachelor party and we were given a private room w/ a tv so we could watch some football. Boys night out w/ steak, wine, and football? Cant beat that. The Bachelor kept saying this was way too fancy and it was all too much when he walked in the room. But one of our waiters told us \"This place is fancy...but you can act ghetto if you want. just relax and have a good time.\"\n\nWe had an excellent experience w/ even better food.

First of all I have to say that this restaurant is at the mall and is uniquely built and perfectly designed. The ambiance is very classy and elegant. The service is on top and the staff is very friendly. \nThis is a great place for delicious seafood. The wine selection is really great. The bone fillet was perfectly cooked and beautifully designed. The bread basket was awesome and the butter had a great flavor. I had the butter cake for dessert. It was one of the best desserts I've ever had. It comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. \nOverall, it's an expensive establishment, but you get your money's worth."

There's a separate room inside what's called the Treehouse, but it looks more like a giant wooden stomach. Which is appropriate. I'd strongly recommend getting seated there and not because of the view (The \"breathtaking\" scenery consists of every high-end luxury goods store on this planet. Then again, I know people who enjoy staring at $5000 handbags from a distance.). It's because the other half of the restaurant looked packed as hell. I wouldn't be surprised if the diners were eating their neighbors steaks by accident. \n\n2. There's more fish on the menu - hence the name - although there was no noticeable difference shellfish selection-wise. Sadly, Billy Ocean wasn't singing at the piano. Mastro's, you screwed up on a golden opportunity here.\n\n3. The bar's wall o' liquor is an impressive monument to chronic liver failure. Then again, this is a city where it's legal to walk down the street slurping Everclear out of a foot-long Eiffel Tower. \n\n4. Steak's great. But not comparable to the Beverly Hills branch."

            "review": "I was introduced to Mastro's by a friend of mine.  He had nothing but good things to say about it, so last year, we gave it a shot. Mastro's is the perfect hybrid of really good seafood and classic steakhouse.  When you walk in the first thing you smell is the juicy steaks coming out of the kitchen. This was our second time here and I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. Lucky for us, it was just as good. I remembered that they had a nice wine list and they still do. Gramercy Guy was able to get Darioush (one of our favorite Napa wineries) by the glass, which is really hard to find. \n\nWhile our waiter was walking us through the menu, some specials, and suggestions, I zeroed in on a salad called, the Spicy Mambo, which is a take on a Caesar salad, without croutons but has horseradish and blue cheese crumbles. It was really tasty and I'm looking forward to going home and adjusting my Caesar dressing recipe with some fresh horseradish. \n\nA secret menu item is the Mastro's Mash. It used to be on the menu but has recently come off, if you ask, they will make it for you. It's like a loaded baked potato but mashed. We also got sauteed spinach, don't forget your greens.\n\nThe design of Mastro's is really amazing, they have what they call a 'tree house', a wooden structure that has two levels. The bottom is the Crystal's information desk and the top level is the Mastro's tree house. When we booked our reservation, we requested a table in the tree house. Once you step inside, the atmosphere totally changes, the band (which is really good) gets muffled and it's very relaxing and feels almost private (there are about a dozen tables).\n\nMy advice for anyone going to Mastro's...share...the portions are huge and unless you have a place to store your left overs, it will all go to waste. Also, the pretzel rolls in the bread basket are amazing. \n\nTo see pictures and read more, go to http://gramercygirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas.html"

So my mom, grandma,  and I were late for our 6:15 reso. I made the reso via open table letting them know it was my moms birthday and we'd like a table in the tree house. Even though we were late(double your travel time if its raining) they honored our table request! \n\nWe started with 2 lemon drop martinis and a glass of white zin. The lemon martinis are no joke. The lemon flavor is PERFECT. Our sever Brandon(I think) explained that they infuse vodka with lemons to make the martinis. For apps we had bone marrow which was served with an arugula salad dressed with capers and escargot served with puff pastry. Both were PHENOMENAL. My 89 yo grandma killed the bone marrow! \n\nFor our meal we shared sea scallops,  ribeye,  alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and mashed sweet potatoes. Everything was FANTASTIC!! The scallops were served in a garlic butter sauce with tomato and parm. I could have licked the bowl they were served in! Because we shared the ribeye it was sliced for us and we were supplied with tongs to serve ourselves(after the initial serving the manager and server helped serve). I loved how they served us our food!\n\nYou need to get the gnocchi. It is AMAZING. The creamed corn was fantastic too. Our service was fantastic. We ordered sparkling wine and our flutes were never empty. Timing of the courses was great. We finished our meal with chocolate layer cake and butter cake. Both were oh the house because it was my moms bday and because we're locals. I didn't care for the chocolate cake but the butter cake was good!! For all the items above including tax and 20+% tip we spent $140 per person. Pretty hefty but well worth it!"

Our waitress (Tanya) was phenomenal the entire evening.  She catered to every need and offered excellent suggestions during ordering.  \n\nWe began with a few cocktails, which were very tasty.  My wife and I decided to split a bowl of Lobster bisque, since I had read reviews that it was very good (I had Lobster  bisque the previous evening at a Venitian restaurant, and was very disappointed).  This bisque was the best I have ever had!  It was a quite large serving with many sizeable pieces of lobster.  It could easily satisfy as a meal by itself!\n\nAs a main course, we split the Chilean Sea Bass ($50, I think).  When asked for suggestions, Tanya recommended the Blackened seasoning.  For sides, we chose the King Crab truffled Gnocci ($29), and Roasted Brussle Sprouts ($11).  The fish came a la carte on a large plate.  For being a split order, the portions were surprisingly generous.  The gnocci and brussle sprouts came as large sides to be shared.  The waitress dished the sides on the main plate.\n\nNow, plated and ready to go, and accompanied by a basket of various breads, my wife and I embarked on the best meal we have ever had!  Initially, we agreed it had to be in the top three, but then we couldn't come up with where we had had a more impeccable meal (and service).\n\nThe Sea Bass was tender, flakey, moist, and so perfectly seasoned.  The Gnocci had large pieces of crab mixed with the creamy gnocci.  For the brussle sprouts, we like them almost burnt on the outside to bring out the flavor.  They, too, were perfectly roasted dark and tender!  \n\nWe ate the all the fish, even though we were quite full.  We took home the leftover gnocci and brussle sprouts, which was enough to make another whole meal for two.  My wife made the comment that she wanted to take home a piece of the bread that was still in the bread basket.  The waitress said she would get us fresh ones.  With our leftovers, she packed four extra pieces of the fresh \"pretzle\" bread.\n\nWe travel a lot, we love to cook, and we love to eat at quality restaurants.  If you go to Vegas, you HAVE to eat here!  We hope your experience is as enjoyable as ours was!"

My steak was so tender that I could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  My husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  The Brussels sprouts were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the Gorgonzola was really mild (I guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).  \n\nAlthough we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate.  Along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  I somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  A really nice gesture that went a long way.  \n\nThe service was fantastic.  Even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.  \n\nThe only thing odd about this location is that it is in the Crystal Cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what I'm used to with this kind of food.

The prices do support this, but once you divide it by 2 or 3 I feel it is worth it.\n\nThe wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They are excellent at giving you the actual methods of preparation, ingredients, etc. on any item vs. places where they basically repeat what is written on the menu (yes, I can read).\n\nThe lobster bisque is sublime.  The creamed spinach is wonderful.  The fish and seafood I have had each time was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  And above all else...be sure to save room for the warm butter cake!\n\nI feel bad for the tourists that usually leave so much on the table.  Me....I'm walking out with my doggy bag!"

Our group of 5 (3 other girls were too drunk to make it, but anyhows), was seated near the door. Hint - if you are seated along the wall, make sure you sit in the booth with the white plush walls. Awesome to lean your head against!\n\nOur waitstaff was superb, although I was a bit sad when they didn't offer any comp things for our meals taking so long! Womp. Also, our table was super dim, we could barely see each other.\n\nAs a party of 5 girls (and our first and only meal of the day), we had:\n\n* Seafood tower w/ oysters, claws, jumbo shrimp, crab. Uhhmaaayyyzing. Get this. Pick whatever you want. I'd go without the oysters as they clocked in about $5/each and were not mind blowing. DEFINITELY get the jumbo shrimp - they were huge and already peeled! There are few things better than that in the world.\n\n* Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocci. UMMMM I am OBSESSED w. this dish. So buttery, so creamy, so YUMMY! I could not stop gobbling this ish up. \n\n* Lobster Mashed Potatoes - nomnomnom! Had huge chunks of fresh luscious lobster nestled within the creamy mashed potatoes. Fan! \n\n* The special 32oz kobe steak, cooked medium rare. This was perfection. $98 worth of absolute perfection. The steak was a perfect pink and melted in my mouth. The leftovers even tasted amazing. \n\n* Chilean Sea Bass, blackened per our waiter's recco. Unfortunately, I didn't love this dish....so i don't really have much to say about it. I think it had more to do with the way it was prepared (I generally don't have my fish blackened) than the fish itself - but not impressed.\n\nTwo girls split a bottle of red vino for just $33 - surprisingly priced at such a nice resto.\n\nAt the end, our bill came out to just about $100 pp. Pricey - definitely, but I think it's worth it! Make sure to request a tree house table!\n\nOh - at the end of the meal, our waiter gave us to-go sippy cups for the rest of our vino! He also jokingly asked if my drunkie friend would also like a cup of agua to go ;) puuahaha"

Victor isn't just one of the finest mixologists whose creations I have had the joy of imbibing.....he is truly an artist.  I tried the Boulevardier (which was the most well-balanced Boulevardier I have ever tried - it was actually a little bit mind-blowing.  I am good friends with one of L.A.'s top bartenders and he says the Boulevardier is one of the trickiest drinks to balance) and something called the \"Faux-jito\" which was also amazing.  I asked Victor to make me one of his original inventions, and I sadly forget the name of the drink, but it was a unique and sensational libation as well.  Next time I visit Las Vegas, I hope to find Victor again and enjoy the best cocktails in Las Vegas!"

            "review": "A couple of weeks ago I went to dinner by myelf at Mastro's Ocean Club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new Crystal's shopping mall at City Center. \n\nIt was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, Parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but I restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the Spicy Mambo Salad ($7.99) and the Sauteed Shrimp appetizer ($18.95). Everything at Mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. The Spicy Mambo Salad was essentially a Caesar salad with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, I very much enjoyed it. I always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and Mastro's was no exception. If anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, I would ask for extra. The sauteed shrimp were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. The huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a lobster bisque reduction rich with butter. The cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. It was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. Overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. One item that I might have tried as a side had I been with someone, however, was the lobster mashed potatoes - they looked fantastic. I wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as I still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.\n\nI wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and I was full by that point, I decided to pass. I'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time I go and I'm not by myself I'll splurge and get it."

The only down side is it burnt a hole in our wallet. But it is a special occasion and we both think it is worth it. \n\nI made a reservation on line at open table and I mentioned our occasion. When we were at the hostess stand, we were greeted by our last name which really surprised me. We waited for about 2 min before we got seated in the tree house, just like how I requested in my reservation. Our server came right away to take our drink orders and also gave us some recommendations. \n\nWe decided to go with the Surf and Turf they have which comes with a 3 pound Maine Lobster and steak of our choice. One thing about the meal here is that it does not come with any sides. You only get what you order. If you want to have mashed potatos or onion rings, you do have to order them seperately which again raises the cost. \n\nThe food came fairly fast after we ordered and the busser divided the meal for us right by the table. The lobster tasted great so did the steak! The server was telling us that they have a live fishtank in the back and all the lobsters they have came in daily directly from Maine! You can't get anything fresher than that in Vegas! The steak is flavorful and juicy. My boyfriend said it could be more tender. As for the side, we ordered Scalloped potatoes and Corossal Onion Rings. We both like the potatoes it was yummy but not too impressed by the Onion Rings, for some reason it tastes a bit soft. \n\nUpon we were finishing up our meal, so stuffed at that point, our server actually surprised us with a complimentary desert for our celebration! What a nice gesture! So definitely put in the occasion if you are celebrating anything at Mastro's! \n\nThe environment is elegant and classy with live performance.

I was asked, \"Is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? Anniversary, birthday...?\" \n\nI replied that I am a living kidney donor and I celebrate that every day. My response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* People have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. Just saying. \n\nI'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that I absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. All the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us. \n\nCouldn't help but wonder: because the \"pod\" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen? \n\n\"Yes, I'd like this limited edition Dior - hold up a minute - I need me a steak! \" Surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, I'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - Carbonanza!!! \n\nThe pretzel bread is otherworldly. I ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. A healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. Even though I don't eat wheat, I was no match for the PB, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss. \n\nMy virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, I had a sippie and was glad I did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but I had to wash all that PRETZEL BREAD down with something, right? \n\nAnother quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. He was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - I think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it. \n\nMy crab cocktail was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. To their credit, when I pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out. \n\nThe salads were nice. Nothing that knocked my Paul Smith espadrilles off, but I was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. Nice, simple, tasty. \n\nI plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... Pretzel Bread tastes good at any hour! \n\nBELIEVE."

It tasted refreshingly yummy!  There were 4 of us.  We ordered The Lobster Bisque, Mussels, Tuna Tartar, and a Cesar salad for appz.  OMG.  Delicious!  As another reviewer pointed out, if you order a main dish, like the Sea Bass, it will come all by itself on a plate.  So order some side dishes.  The waiter will plate it up for you at your table.  We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert.  Bummer, because I'm sure it would have been yummy.  Our bill was around $475 with tip.  So not too bad with all that we had, including cocktails and wine."

Love the look of the wooden structure but we were seated outside of it so it was more like eating in the aria mall (which is also beautiful but not as distinctive). Very good bread. Mixed seafood appetizer was nice, with all the classic things you would expect like lobster and prawns prepared adequately. Jalape\u00f1o sashimi was also added and was great. Cocktails well prepared but not imaginative. \n\nFor dinner I had sea bass which was overcooked. When you order any of the fish, they ask if you want it pan seared or encrusted. Therefore there is nothing imaginative about any of the fish entrees. It's just a piece of fish on a plate. I think this approach can work for steak, but I'd really rather the chef put some effort into a creative method and flavor for each fish on the menu.  Sides were good but nothing noteworthy.\n\nOverall par for the course for Vegas. Unjustifiably expensive food with service that is excellent but also a little pushy, so you end up with more food than you want to eat. Very beautiful venue. None of the food or cocktails stood out."

We each got a martini. \nClam chowder was ok, we had better at the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. \nMaine lobster was a bit overpriced but very fresh. 5 waiters came to take out the shell! Girlfriend was amazed\nRound eye steak was very  generous. Well cooked, and the outside was pretty crispy despite asking for medium rare. Inside was soft and moist as expected.\nGot the cream spinach on the side.\nMartinis were very strong and plentiful. Water melon martini was very good. We definitely started to speak more loudly and laughing for no reason after a few full glasses. \nAtmosphere overall feels very open, live music is excellent. Waiters were attentive and professional without feeling overwhelmingly present. Girlfriend had a great time so it deserves the 4 stars. Overall, a great experience though a tad pricey, especially the lobster."

The food is a little pricy but for the amount of food,great service and beautiful atmosphere you get it was worth it. I'm obsessed with the cran gnocchi !

I let the waiter create it for us.  It included, Alaskan king crab legs, lobster, oyster, carved crab meat, jumbo shrimps....  They were all very fresh and cooked,except the oyster.  \n\nI had the lobsters bisque which was excellent.  The wedge salad was good but nothing special.  For the entree, I ordered rib eye steak, medium, with lobster mashed potatoes.  The rib eye was sooooo tender with great flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes was unique and best tasting mashed potatoes I've had.  There was a good amount of lobster meat inside.\n\nI tried to taste my friend's prime rib, which was not as good as my rib eye.  I did not have a chance to taste the dessert since we were all so full.  I thought the setting in the terrace was a bit informal not compatible with the price charged for the dinner.  I'd definitely recommend sitting in the tree house.  The seafood tower cost more than  $200 by itself.  The rib eye steak was $52.  The mashed potatoes was $38, but a good amount was given.  If you plan on going, you should plan for $75 to $100 per person.  The service was a bit slow but very good attitude.  Oh, be prepared to pay to $2 tip to the restroom attendant each time you use it."

You are really paying extra in exchange for the privilege of eating your dinner inside of a giant, 3-D artist's rendition of a tree house.  It's still pretty good though.  I got the big bone-in fillet, creamed spinach, and club house salad.  The house salad has shrimps and crab in it.  It's quite good.  The warm butter cake is OK.

From the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, I was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (OC). The atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at Mastro's. I ordered my usual bone-in ribeye and sides of lobster mashed potatoes, creamed corn, grilled asparagus and creamed spinach - all were pretty good. The finale AKA warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. They brought it out and it was cold. Now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering I had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of Caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. The service was great and I would definitely eat here again. Maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? Anyways, Mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and I will definitely give it another shot next time I am in Vegas."

I was hesitant because I've seen postcard-type ads for this place at CES, and I believe that places that need to advertise aren't the best. Opentable also promoted it with extra points.\n\nAnyways, OpenTable showed same day availability for party of 5, so I booked it anyways, no cost booking and I could cancel if I found a better place.\n\nWe were seated promptly at the reservation time, no need for a lengthy wait like the previous restaurants this past week. Mastro's wasnt that busy when we arrived, although it did once 8:30p rolled around.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and sides. However I did not know the entrees come as that, with the sides making the dish. What I also didn't know was the production involved once dinner arrived....\n\nThe production went as follows, you get one or two servers serving the entrees, then a supporting team of servers go around putting sides on your entree plate. I believe we had six servers, in a high paced whirlwind headturning array of food being served onto our plates.\n\nThe $37 lobster mash potato was alright, but having a similar $15 smaller portion lobster mash at N9NE the previous night, I would skip Mastro's and go for N9NE's.\n\nI would skip the Au Gratin Potato, it was nothing more than potato with cheese melted on top, not what I expected.\n\nCreamed spinach was good. \n\nYes, the booze is marked up.\n\nAll told, of the three dinners I had in LV, this ranked third."

No complaints there.\n\nFor our entree, I ordered the bone in ribeye and my wife got a filet.  This was probably my first experience at a high end restaurant where the steaks were wet aged.  My impression was unfortunately mixed.  The steaks were definitely supremely tender but they lacked that meaty punch that good dry aged steaks usually have.  Overall they tasted like a really tender version of a supermarket steak - not bad but definitely below expectations.\n\nWe got the warm butter cake for dessert which was very good.

The shrimps were jumbo sized and so fresh it's as if they had just got it from the ocean! \n\nFor our entrees my fianc\u00e9 had the rib eye and I had the 3lbs Maine lobster. Our server brought out the food and de shelled the lobster in front of me. He even cut up my steak in front of me. Talk about excellent service!

Baller status achieved again.\n-Caesar's upgrading our room to a suite after we collectively lost tons of money.  Then won double that back.\n-Finally, Mastro's\n\nYou see?  We were out there for a Bachelor Party.  Not just ANY Bachelor Party.  A Bachelor Party of Epic Proportions.  The kind you and your buddies talk about for decades.  Fourteen guys hell bent on reliving college memories from over a decade prior.  Fourteen guys that wanted to go out, make Vegas our bitch, and have the best time ever.  Almost all of this was achieved.  Except for the making Vegas our bitch part.  Vegas pimp slapped us all.  Hold me Vegas.  \n\nMastro's capped the trip off.  We decided to take the Bachelor to a great meal.  Mastro's rolled out the red carpet.  Complete with private room with a view.  No dancing girls.  Otherwise, it would've been a 6-star performance.  Still, overall, one of the Top 5 meals of my life.  Including my hometown Atlanta, NYC, Chicago, LA, and elsewhere?  \n\nSo what did I eat?  I know you're dying to know.  I had the Dungeness Crab Cocktail to start.  So they do this Dry Ice thing to add to the presentation.  It's cool and all.  I don't really need that stuff though.  The crab itself though?  Slap my mama good.  I remember one of my buddy's trying to grab a piece of grab and me trying to stab his hand with my fork.  Back off my crab homey or get a stump back.  \n\nThe next thing ordered was the Bone In Ribeye.  If I'm going to eat at a very nice place, I'm probably getting a slab of red meat at some point.  This didn't disappoint either.  Literally melting in my mouth while having a perfect combination of seasoning and outer char.  My buddy asked this time and I still tried to stab his hand.  \n\nI'm not normally selfish about food I order, but when it tastes this good and all you got was Salmon and Creamed Spinach, you're simply not allowed to offer that for trade.  Idiot.  \n\nI am not kidding about this place though.  It really was that good.  I can't remember our server's name.  He was pretty good though.  Made sure to bring the bachelor some free stuff too.  Not too shabby.  \n\nIt's probably an amazing place to bring a lady too.  Get the dungeness crab.  I'll be back.  \n\nVegas.  Hold me."

I opted for medium rare, my friend opted for rare, and I think most of the table preferred the medium rare since it had more flavor although the rare meat was more tender. It really depends on your steak preferences.\n\nThe dessert was butter cake. The first couple bites I thought were way to sweet, but that's why it came with a side of heavy whip cream. Top the dessert with the whip cream and it really tones down the sweetness.\n\nThe things that stood out the most was the ambiance and quality of food."

But then for the main entree I got the bone-in filet with a side of Mastro's mashed potatoes.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth delicioso.  Even the simple mashed potatoes was creamy and savory.  It sure is a splurge but I highly recommend it if you are in Vegas and want to pamper your tastebuds."

From start to finish, the food tasted superb, and service was impeccable. \n\nFOOD HIGHLIGHTS\n* Bread basket: Served steamy and warm with Mastro's fresh salted butter. Pretzel bread and cheesy, cracker-like breadsticks were my favorites.\n* Truffle-lobster gnocchi appetizer special: The chewiest, richest gnocchi I've tried, with tender lobster meat and drizzled with truffle oil.\n* Bone-in filet steak, medium rare: Soft, tender beef, topped with clarified butter and a pinch of herbs. Served on a 400 degree plate, so it stays nice and toasty throughout your meal!\n* Butter cake: Devastatingly moist, melty, slightly salty, and of course, buttery, with a crisp crust, a scoop of French vanilla ice cream, and whole plate of freshly whipped cream. Not overrated in any sense of the word.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now because I'll drool all over my work laptop keyboard otherwise..."

I'm a seafood lover, and a lover of fine dining, so it is right up my alley.\n\nLocated in Crystals, the layout is interesting. You simultaneously have the feeling of being in the mall, yet separated from it. There is a dome of sorts as the ceiling, so shoppers cannot see inside and gawk at the diners, but the diners can somewhat see out into the mall. Tables are a smidge close for comfort, but that's just a personal preference.\n\nService, as expected, was wonderful. Our server was friendly, personable, knowledgeable and professional without being overbearing. There is an extensive cocktail list, and I enjoyed my cocktail- \"Strawberry Dream\", which is very sweet, but I like sweet drinks.\n\nFor an appetizer, we split the lobster cocktail, which ended up being more meat than originally expected based on the presentation. Although the server warned us about the heat/kick of the \"atomic horseradish\", it actually was quite bearable, and complimented the lobster well.\n\nI opted for the crab cakes as my entree, and they were also quite good. Perhaps not the best crab cakes I've ever had, but certainly a fine showing. They perhaps could have used a bit more seasoning, or some of the horseradish, but they were full of meat, and the little filler held things together well. We got a side of the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, and wow!! Huge portion, and holy cheese, batman! Super cheesy!! Really good, very mild though. \n\nFor dessert,  we split the butter cake, and it was melt in your mouth good. Seriously. The homemade whipped cream along with the ice cream may have been overkill, but if you're going to do dessert, might as well go all out! \n\nOf course, Maestro's is on the expensive side of things, but if you want a solid seafood fine dining experience, I wouldn't shy away from it."

I'd heard of the Mastro's chain before, especially their swanky steakhouses in Orange County and LA, but this was my first time hearing of their seafood restaurant.  It seemed like the perfect opportunity to lose my Mastro's virginity without being subjected to massive slabs of red meat.\n\nFirst thing's first -- Mastro's is enormous, and it's absolutely stunning.  In terms of architectural design, this place is a feast for the eyes.  The interior of the restaurant is bold and stunning.  Much of the dining room is suspended over the rest of the mall in a giant wooden \"treehouse\".  I sat at the bar, which was a veritable mountain of mirrors and glass.  Just being at Mastro's feels glamorous.\n\nAfter being seated, I ordered a glass of the \"Grace Lane\" Riesling (which was fabulous) and was promptly offered a complementary breadbasket, filled with pretzel bread, toasted baguette, and various other goodies.  \n\nI noticed that most of the plates being carted around the restaurants were pretty large, so I decided to build a dinner out of two different appetizers.  I opted for the sauteed sea scallops and the ahi tuna tostada.\n\nNeedless to say, two appetizers were more than enough food, since these so-called \"appetizers\" were really entree portions.  The sea scallops included 3 giant scallops, soaking in a rich and buttery sauce and served alongside huge slabs of cheesy baguette.  The ahi tuna tostada was actually 3 separate tostadas, each loaded to the hilt with big-eye tuna, avocado, and ponzu chili sauce.\n\nOf the two dishes, I preferred the scallops, which were simply prepared and oh so silky and indulgent.  The ahi tuna tostada was less enjoyable, since the tuna was served warm and had a slightly mealy consistency.  \n\nService was efficient, formal, and bland -- fairly typical for a chain restaurant, but especially a Vegas chain restaurant.  \n\nAll in all, I'd really glad I had the chance to experience Mastro's for the first time.  The behemoth portions, straightforward food, and stiff service felt like Cheesecake Factory -- not a bad place per se, but not somewhere that I'd visit on the reg, either."

We were in Vegas celebrating, and seeing that this place had high ratings, I took him here to try it out. The restaurant itself is inside a mall, and though we didn't get seated in the treehouse looking part, it was still a pleasant visit. It was our first time dining at ANY Mastro's restaurant, and definitely won't be our last! We got a waiter named Tim (Timothy), and he has got to be one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was very informative and was extremely nice. He showed us the different menus and helped us choose. I decided on the chilean sea bass. It was sooo good! The flavor was on point, and it was a perfect portion size. My fiance ordered the filet for himself, and his was overcooked, but they knew right away after he received it. Dan asked him if he wanted to switch it for a new one, but he said it was fine, and ate it anyways. He liked the flavor and was genuinely fine with it and didn't think it was really a big deal. We also ordered calamari as an appetizer, and a side of sweet potato fries. (Which was family sized, for sharing.. but we didn't know!) The calamari was awesome. We ended up only being able to eat about 10 fries out of that giant pile.. lol. We were too full! A different waiter served us sprite and ended up spilling it all over my fiance's shoulder.. yikes. They did help him clean it up though. In the end, my fiance got a warm butter cake as his birthday gift :D yay! It was so delicious, we ate it all.. despite the fact that we were super full! We were also given complementary wine for the steak being overcooked and for the sprite spill. Now THAT's excellent customer service, and if Vegas wasn't so far, I'd come back more often. I'll miss this place :( Hope the one in Newport is just as professional! But I know if we were in Vegas visiting, this spot will be one of the first places I'd go to eat at. Thanks for the wonderful experience Mastro's! :) Stay gold."

The smoked salmon was delicious. Not anything special necessarily, but it sure was delicious. The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and came with such a delicious sauce, a superb aioli as opposed to the more traditional tomato sauce.\n\nOne thing the group really appreciated was that Mastro's agreed to specially make a burger for one individual who didn't want to eat steak. Of course, the individual got sick, but we were so appreciative of their willingness to accommodate us that we asked to have the burger brought out and we all shared it - cut it up into sliders. They were melt-in-your-mouth incredible. For a classy steakhouse, Mastro's sure makes an incredible burger.\n\nI had the Chilean Sea Bass for my entree, most everyone else had steaks. Boy am I glad I went with the Sea Bass though, I was already feeling a bit full from the appetizers and then the sides on top sure was a lot of food. The fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned excellently. Flaky and fairly light actually, it was a good sized helping as well. Would definitely get again.\n\nFor sides the table all raved about the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, but I'm allergic, so I couldn't eat it. Which was fine by me because the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese was heavenly. And the portion of the side was enormous. Honestly, I could've had the mac and cheese side as my entire meal and gone home happy.\n\nFood was great, service was as good as expected, just a wonderful meal overall.

The food is great and since you want everything the real problem becomes trying to not order too much. Service is top notch and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Shrimp cocktail is served chilled with dry ice and the atomic horseradish that comes with it is sweet and will singe your sinuses in the best possible way. The lobster mashed potatoes are a must get, rich and filled with large pieces of lobster meat. We also got the Wagyu tomahawk cut to share which was perfectly marbled. \n\nSo why not 5 stars?  These items may seem nit picky but you can be the judge. We ordered the Wagyu black and blue (seared rare) and while it did have the cool red center you really want a better crust on it. In addition I know we were sharing but they simply cut the steak down the middle with one person getting the bone piece. For something like this you would expect a presentation similar to a porterhouse. Lastly although it shouldn't matter that it located inside a mall it does mean that the people next to you could be in shorts, flip flops and a backwards baseball cap. I know it's Vegas but come on."

            "review": "The fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at Mastro's Ocean Club.  I had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside The Shops at Crystals.\n\nIt was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  It actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  Not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary Warm Butter Cake ala mode, Mastro's signature dessert.  This was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n\nBut the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  After enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, Diane and I dove into succulent hot Vanilla Battered Shrimp.  These big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n\nFor our main we each ordered an 8-oz Filet, which here is called a \"Petite Filet,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of Alaskan King Crab Legs.  Both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  Accompanying Bearnaise Sauce was drinkable, and a Peppercorn Sauce was not far behind.  The hot and long sections of crab legs were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  They tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  And while Diane praised her large and cheesy Twice Baked Potato, I delighted in a huge mound of skinny Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  Sauteed Mushrooms were lovely, too, but I hardly needed them.  We were stuffed.  \n\nWith a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  Our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  Even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n\nMastro's is pricey to be sure.  But, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Without question we will soon become repeat guests."

I couldn't convince anyone to go to Cut nor Craftsteak, so we ended up at Mastro's.  This Mastro's is located in the City Center's shopping mall called Crystals.  Just look for the unique treehouse design.  We were lucky to get a table inside the treehouse.  \n\nI enjoy eating course meals and family style, so here's how we ordered:\n\nappetizers:\nEscargot\nColossal shrimp cocktail\n2nd course:\nSeared Ahi tuna\n2 Lobster bisques\nMain course:\nBone-in ribeye\nGarlic mashed potatoes\nCreamed corn\n\nWe enjoyed most of our dishes except for the escargot and the seared ahi tuna.  Those two we wouldn't ever order again.  The lobster bisque and bone-in ribeye were the stars of the night.  There were 4 of us eating together and that was plenty of food.  We were so stuffed that we skipped the butter cake.  Service was friendly and our server staggered our meal perfectly.  Another excellent meal!"

Oddly enough I was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. It's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the Crystals.\n\nWe were started with a huge bread basket. All of which was fresh and delicious. I also had the Strawberry Mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.\n\nIf I'm being honest, it was the Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($28) that swayed me to try Mastro's. It's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. All the flavor, but without the fuss. It is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.\n\nWith \"Ocean Room\" in the name I had to try the fish. I was tempted by the halibut on special, but I chose the Chilean Seabass ($49). It was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. Surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the Rack of Lamb ($49) and it was fantastic. I really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. We went for decadence when selecting our sides. I had to try the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($33) and the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese ($14) piqued his interest. Both were rich, creamy and gooey. The crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. Both were mighty tasty, however.\n\nWe ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. Rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. The portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. We were much too full to attempt dessert. Their famous butter cake will have to wait. Service was attentive; overall, a really great experience. It's nice to have another option for seafood in the desert."

I'm a fan.\n\nWhen I called to make reservations a few weeks in advance, I had asked to be seated inside the \"tree house\" and they were able to accomodate this request. \n\nMastro's is a steakhouse chain that is better than most. If your school of thought is that Ruth's Chris is the pinnacle of chain steak in America, then you will be pleasantly surprised to have broadened your horizons.  \n\nWhat I like about Mastro's is that the dining experience is very consistent regardless of the location you choose to frequent.\n\nThis particular Mastro's is inside a shopping mall. A very nice shopping mall, but still a shopping mall. It's slightly off-putting, but does not affect the food or the service. If you wish to eat at a \"proper\" steakhouse, with burnished leather, dark wood furnishings, and Laguioles then perhaps Mastro's is not the spot for you.\n\nIf you're not too snobbish about your surroundings, I think this is a solid steakhouse in Vegas that doesn't require you to traipse through a casino to get to it.\n\nThe food is consistent with any other Mastro's so I won't dwell too much on it. \n\nStick with what you know. \n\nThe lobster mash, the crab and truffle gnocchi, biggest ribeye you can split with someone, or porterhouse if they insist on a tenderloin or filet.  \n\nThe butter cake is worth every last calorie, so please be sure to save room for it at the conclusion of your meal."

It had a perfect consistency of creaminess and flavor with large pieces of lobster. I had the Chilean Sea bass for my main entree along with the mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side. The Sea bass had perfect consistency and was huge in portion. It was flaky and cooked perfectly.

I was able to easily booked reservations with Mastro's OC the same day (on a Sunday) through yelp/open table.\n\nAfter sealing the deal on this place, I had somewhat high expectations of what my experience and food was going to be like. Mastro's is located on the second floor of City Center and is surrounded by the endless amount of high end stores (Prada, Gucci, Jimmy Choo etc. etc.) so these visual cues added to my high expectations. My date and I were comfortably seated along their edge where we were able to gaze out into the nicely, holiday decorated city center as well as watch 90% of the people window shop...guess it's too expensive and not the right time of year to treat yourself to these classy brands?\n\nAnyway, to get down to it, I was cool with the service and location but the food was OK; it wasn't to my liking and it wasn't to my disliking either.\n\nMy date ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare and it came to our table sizzling hot, at the right temperature (or so we thought) until he got down to the middle. It was not warm but not cold either...just this weird temperature that didn't seem right. At least we were able to get that replaced ASAP. \n\nI decided to go with 2 lobster tails--I had one regularly prepared and one vanilla battered. I should have just  had it reguarly prepared because the battered one wasn't really anything special; I didn't even taste the vanilla...or perhaps there might have been a hint of it that my taste buds were unable to pick up on. \n\nAnd the sides...geez, it was expensive and nothing extraordinary! I felt like I could have chosen the potatoes and mushrooms out myself and made the garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms myself. Actually, I think I could actually do Mastro's up in these items (not saying I'm some kind of professional chef or anything like that, just emphasizing that these items were nothing impressive). \n\nSo after 2 ice teas, the 2 entrees and 2 sides the bill came up to about $160 without tip. I can't say the price and food quality ratio was appropriate, though again, the service was top notch. Oh and their artisan breads were delicious as well. I will also say I appreciated the follow up call they did with me the next day; I never had that happen and I thought that was nice of them to do. I guess I might come back here again but purchase something else that might tickle my fancy."

Do not get me wrong reader - here is this amazing bird's nest modern structure that looks like it should be in a museum somewhere....nested in a MALL. Given the shops were all upscale. But still, a MALL to say the least. It had that new mall smell that you'll just never get out of your clothes. It left me wondering what the restaurant and atmosphere would be like during dinner service. Well, I didn't have to wonder. My group had planned a bachelorette dinner for the lucky bride to be. \n\nStaff - These people are pros. Seriously, every person works together like a well oiled machine. We had a group of nine girls, which is not easy but I'm sure they see that pretty often. It is Vegas. And the service was fantastic. Our waiter and the whole wait staff was really great and accommodating. Our reservations were at 745pm and we had to be out of there by 915pm to catch our ride. They were so mindful of that the whole time, but also didn't take away from the experience. \n\nThe meal - What can I say about the food that has not already been said? Pretty much nothing - so I'll just reinforce what my fellow yelpers have been saying the whole time - it's amazing. I ordered the salmon and one of the other girls ordered a fillet and we shared both plates. Both cooked perfectly. For sides - Lobster mashed potatoes, regular mashed potatoes and asparagus. All delicious. \n\nThe whole experience was wonderful. And I had serious reservations about what this was going to entail when I walked in. But Mastro's did not disappoint. I enjoyed stepping back and being able to compare my experience in LA to Vegas. And although each restaurant had their similarities whether it be with the menu or just how the staff serves you, both restaurants still had a their own uniqueness which made each experience stand out."

In fact, that's the only potential \"negative\" of our experience. We ordered WAY TOO MUCH food, but that's not our server's fault. He warned us but we refused to believe him. The good news is we got to try a little bit of everything, the bad news is we ate a little too much of everything and still had food left over! \n\nI had the Chilean Sea Bass cooked \"oreganata\" style, which was amazing. They really know how to prepare seafood here. It's easy to overcook fish but this was cooked perfectly. Sea Bass is one of my favorite fish and this is easily one of the best I've ever had.  My wife decided to REALLY splurge and ordered one of the specials that was on offer, an 8oz Japanese Wagyu Steak for $125. Words don't do it justice. It was delicious. It melted in your mouth and was just buttery, rich and savory. Not a trace of gristle, every bite was perfect. \n\nOur friends ordered the roasted chicken which was excellent, a bone in ribeye with truffle butter which was almost as amazing as the Wagyu Steak for half the price, and halibut, which was also excellent and perfectly cooked. We started with oysters (I'm not a oyster connoisseur so I can't provide any more detail than that) and for sides we had sauteed asparagus, creamed spinach, gorgonzola mac and cheese, salt and vinegar fries and lobster mashed potatoes (now you see why we ordered too much food). All of the aforementioned items were excellent but the standout was the lobster mashed potatoes. We're not talking about mashed potatoes with bits of lobster flavor, we're talking about mashed potatoes drenched in melted butter with massive chunks of lobster. Seriously, there was not a bit of lobster less than an inch thick in there. It was fantastic. \n\nFor dessert we again ordered too much. We had the butter cake (and you should too) which was easily shareable by 4 or more people, but again since I didn't believe the waiter, we ordered two. We also had chocolate covered strawberries and Key Lime Pie, both of which were fantastic, but the butter cake is a standout! \n\nDrinks. The wine menu is extensive and the beer selection was pretty decent too for a \"fancy\" type of place (which in my experience usually seem to look down on beer). The signature cocktails/martinis were delicious and, again, nicely portioned for the price. $17 seems pricey for a martini until you realize they give you the shaker with practically another entire glass full in there for a top off. They also have a nice selection of ports, dessert wines, and cordials for after dinner. I don't usually splurge on an \"after dinner\" drink, but I was in full on splurge mode that night, so I did. The waiter recommended a white dessert wine as opposed to a port since it would pair better with the butter cake, and he was not wrong. I had no idea what was good so I went with his recommendation, which was a Royal Tokaji 5 Puttonyos Aszu wine for $25. It blew me away. It was thick, viscous and sweet but not overly sweet and the flavor was a delicate array of fruit (apricot, hints of citrus and honey) with a creamy, slightly smoky finish. I immediately looked it up online and ordered a bottle for home, which was $50, that's how much I loved it. \n\nI can't reiterate enough how special this experience was to us. Our total for 6 people was a little over $800, but that price seems perfectly justified based on our experience. We would return here without hesitation, although we would definitely listen to our waiter next time when he says we might be ordering too much food, and if we were to show more restraint on our next visit, I think we could get out the door for under $200 (for 2 people). Which as a meal for a special occasion would be more than worth the price."

The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the sushi was excellent. The sushi dish actually came with quite a large amount of sushi. The bread basket was pretty nice also. We also got the asparagus and the mashed potatoes. We actually had a miscommunication with our very very knowledgable waitress and wanted lobster mashed potatoes instead. The manager came up to us and without hesitation brought us a lobster mashed potatoes literally within 3 minutes. The lobster mashed potatoes were also great. For dessert we had the butter cake and it was to die for. I'm not usually a cake person, but this was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Highly recommended - great service, great food. The price tag of the meal is quite high however; with all of our food the total was still about $100 even with a $100 gift card."

The restaurants in Orange County & LA are so much better then this.\n\nI was there Friday May 4th with a group of 20 people. I thought it would be amazing since it is Mastro's after all. It was the opposite. Good service, but food was so so. My twin lobsters were so over cooked. It was tough & crunchy. I ate half of one & gave up. Felt bad not to eat it, but it was awful. I eat lobster all of the time & it's supposed to melt in your mouth. That was not the case here. The rest of my group ordered filet mignon & they were all complaining as well. Over cooked & chewy is what I was told. The shrimp cocktail was fine. The oysters were ok. The asparagus wasn't good. The cremed corn was good. The alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi was excellent. The creme brulee was great. But, I would never go there again. Unless you are in the wooden dome seating area it fells like you're just eating at the food court in the mall. Not what I expected. Save your money please & go to STK in the Cosmo or Joe's at Caesars. The lobster is to die for."

I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!\n\nSo the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience\n\nOur cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.\n\nAs for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious\n\nSince we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal."

It was great, too tantalizing to wait and take a photo; we only could do so once we took a break. Delicious morsels of crab stacked in a bowl over dry-ice. The red cocktail sauce has some horseradish-but if you like it hot, ask for some on the side. \nWe planned to order one of the healthy vegetable side dishes but our waiter Jonathan (\"Johnny\") gave such a wonderful description of the lobster mashed potatoes that we couldn't resist. \nUnless you're big eaters, the way to go is to split a steak. At the next table over it looked as though their steak was cut in half before cooking. But Jonathan suggested that he cut our bone-in Kansas City Strip into slices after cooking, served on a plate \"in the middle.\"  This was perfect.  Highly recommended. We couldn't even finish our halves of this delicious, well-cooked \"medium\" steak. \nThe mashed potatoes were just as described. Great. A big splurge, but this dish added to our memorable meal. \nToo bad no \"desert pocket\" left for the longed for Butter cake.  Next time. \nIf you're looking for a place for one of those meals you savor not only at the time but also in your memory for a long time, excellent food served by a pro, Mastro's is your place and Jonathan, who's been here since they opened, is the waiter you want."

It was pretty cool to be seated there because I saw this the last time I was walking around here and had no idea it was for Mastro's. For such a nice restaurant I really expect the sea bass to be of top notch but it sadly was not. We split some sides of scalloped potatoes (everyone thought these were gross and overly salty), sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and mac & cheese. The sides are nice but none of that really matters if the main entree doesn't hit the spot.\n\nMy friend order the special \"tomahawk\" steak which is a massive piece of meat on a gimongous bone, making it look like a tomahawk - pretty awesome!"

With every element of the meal nearly flawless, I could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. Yelp here has Mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke! \nWe came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were MORE than exceeded.\n\nWe were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"Tree House,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. I'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again. \nAs we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). Big plus for this. \nAfter immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. We didn't even ask. Nice touch. \n\nRob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. I was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). Rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes. \n\nWe like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! Not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) Now, where do I even begin...\n\n--Vanilla Battered Shrimp: Caution: Oxymoron... MASSIVE shrimp. The biggest shrimp I've seen in recent memory. The batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. Three to an order! \n\n--Burrata & Heirloom Tomato Salad: Mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! Yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. We asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.\n\n--Clam Chowder: Hands down the best I've ever had. Not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. Piping hot when it arrived which I really appreciate with soups. \n\n--Mac & Cheese: Ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. Served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). On top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...I think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper! \n\n--Bone-in Filet Mignon: I really don't like throwing out the \"best I've ever had\" card very often. Because, honestly, how many things can take that title? Well, this definitely takes the \"best filet I've ever had\" title. Join the club, clam chowder. It had the taste of a NY Strip, but was tender as a filet should be. And, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. I like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done. \n\n--Warm Butter Cake: Okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). My mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? Out comes this large, circular cake and a BEHEMOTH side of whipped cream. Really. View my picture to see how much there was. Think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. Fantastic dessert. And what's even better? Rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" Winnnnnnn.\n\n\nFrom now on, every time I'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, Mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. I cannot wait to go there again next time I've got a few bucks to blow."

I ordered my 8oz filet medium well; the waiter confirmed it would be lightly pink in the center, and it came out charred, crunchy and bone dry. Absolutely terrible.  A proper steakhouse always asks you if the steak was cooked to your liking; my waiter never asked me. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass, also overcooked, and she pushed it aside after a few bites.  This place specializes in steak and seafood?  What a joke. Any high class restaurant in Vegas blows this place away, I've eaten at almost all of them. Of all the restaurants in the $100 per person class, I'd rate Mastro's dead last. \n\nService was good, albeit a little slow.

Started off with bottle of French champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! Menu is huge, in addition to lots of choices of steaks, the seafood selections were great too, also sushi items. \n\nOur server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter. The presentation was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, beautiful and appetizing. The Kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. But the other things were bad, the crab meat was so hard and chewy, the prawns were the worst, they were hard to cut, harder to chewy on, almost impossible to swallow, we couldn't even finish them, so wasteful! The horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, great with the chilled seafood. It pains me to say that this seafood platter was the worst I have ever had, for a famous steakhouse, that's unacceptable! \n\nClam chowder soup with garlic bread, our server was nice enough to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so. The soup portion was still huge after splitting, too bad I didn't want any soup, so I just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture. \n\nLobster roll as my entree, it was so bad, the rice was thick, the stuffings were flavorless, I didn't like the cream sauce on it, I had one and half pieces, and couldn't continue to eat. \n\n12 oz bone in filet in medium rare, the plate was 400 degrees hot! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! Absolutely loved every single bite of it! \n\nSide of mushrooms, I love mushrooms so much, but those were so bland, I had one bite, that's it. \n\nSo, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? Or Mastro's is really just for steak lovers? My food was just bad... I didn't even eat that much, just sat there, sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date! \n\nThey gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. The cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! I had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. It's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. Reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. Tab was $350 for two. \n\nTo be honest, I didn't like my food, not one bit, dinner experience was good, I was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. Their restroom is located on second floor next to private dining room, the elevator was claustrophobic. \n\n I don't think this place is good for dinner dates, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. The restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. But it's definitely great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!"

I also felt like I was eating the same thing with my main dish because the scallops came on slices of bread which was the same type of bread that was served to us for appetizer. The portion was quite generous though. The bf and I were trying to guess how many I'd get. I thought maybe 2 big pieces, and he thought maybe 3 moderately sized pieces. The dish came with 5 moderately sized pieces. The boyfriend's 12oz filet, however, was on a whole different level, and I couldn't stop eating his food.

            "review": "*** Word of warning: this steakhouse is located inside a mall and you will most likely have a view of a high-end store while you eat. *** \n\nTypically, I'm a huge fan of Mastro's and every time we are celebrating a special occasion, we will pay a visit to Mastro's. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed in the Vegas location. \n\nI will start with the pros. The food was sublime. It was exactly the quality of food Mastro's provides at their locations in Phoenix. I started with the Ocean Club Salad which came with fresh shrimp with blue cheese dressing, avocado and tomatoes. The salad was refreshing and delicious and filled me up! However, I wasn't done just yet. Following the salad, I ordered the crab cake and shared the lobster mac and cheese with my husband. The crab cake was made of fresh crab and was more crab than filling which was perfect. The Lobster Mac and Cheese is always a must and you can't visit Mastro's without ordering it! I also stole a bite of my husband's filet which was cooked to perfection. Yes, I did roll out of the restaurant but rolled out fat and happy from the amazing food! They cook everything to perfection and it's always a gluttonous good time. \n\nSo why the three stars? Sadly, that goes to ambiance and service. The restaurant in located inside a mall. Granted, it's a very high-end mall but it's still a mall just the same. That wouldn't make a huge difference except that the restaurant has an open floor plan with an open balcony which means you are looking out into the mall while you eat. It's very light and bright and just doesn't provide for a very romantic experience. They do have a tree-like structure that you can eat in which hides the mall a little bit, but it's hard to forget that you're in a mall during your meal. Considering that it's Vegas and there are so many venues with wonderful ambiance, I would choose another restaurant next time. \n\nThe customer service was also a bit disappointing. I felt like we were always trying to get our server's attention. He wasn't very attentive to us and anytime we wanted to order another drink or food, we had to hunt him down. We were going to order dessert but it took him so long to check on us that by the time he came to our table, we were just ready to go at that point. I would have liked it if the server was a bit more attentive so that we didn't have to track him down the whole meal. \n\nWhile the food was amazing, the ambiance and service left something to be desired and since Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from, we will choose a different restaurant during our next visit to the Strip."

While there are a handful of high quality restaurants in Las Vegas, Mastros Ocean Club stood out for its consistent, high quality cuisine and  great service.  While the nose bleed prices are over the top and the greet staff unexceptional, the food was excellent, the portions ample, menu deep, ambiance nice and service excellent.  That, in and of itself, is sufficient for me to reserve at least one of my nights in Vegas.  The thing that would bring me there every night was my waitress, Heather.  Sweet, smart, personable, attentive, funny, efficient, knowlegable and unassuming.  She handled tables of conference guys, couples and singles with equal aplomb. I live in NYC, eat out alot, have my goto places with goto staff, and have to say that in a very short period of time Heather distinguished herself as top notch.  If you're lucky enough to get her as your waitress, with sufficent credit line, you'll eat there every night."

            "review": "I wanted this to knock my socks off, but it fell short.  Mostly due to the service, partly due to the strange atmosphere and the fact that they were 40 minutes late seating us when we had reservations and arrived early for them.\n\nFirst, the bar.  There is a beautiful bar, great drink list, nice bartenders, piano and lounge singer... all setting up for a relaxing setting, right?  Nope, the lounge singer, with piano accompaniment, sang songs by Katy Perry and Rhianna, and songs like \"Call Me Maybe\".  WTF?  It was just so weird! \n\nWe had 8:30 reservations, arrived around 8:20, and didn't get a table around 9:10.  That's just bad planning on their part, I believe.\n\nNow, the service was the worst part of our meal. The menu is very simple, with no explanations of any of the items.  You would rely on your server to elaborate on preparations, etc, when the menu contains none.  This was where the meal went off the tracks.  There was just a list of all the available entrees (lots of different fish, etc), and our server showed up and said, \"are you guys ready?\".  I said something like, \"we're unsure of the preparations available for each fish\"... and he said something like, \"oh, we can do blackened... you know... whatever......\".  SERIOUSLY?  That's it?  So guess what I ordered... Blackened halibut!  I didn't know how else to order!  Even the salads, the one we ordered was the spicy mambo salad, had no explanation.  What the hell is a spicy mambo salad?  I don't know, so thank god we liked it.  It was like a spicy caesar salad and was very good.  My halibut was delicious, my husband's tuna was great.  Portions are RIDICULOUSLY HUGE.  I wouldn't suggest 2 side dishes for 2 people, just choose one and share it.  We had so much food left over, it was depressing to leave it all to be thrown away, but it's Vegas!  We're not gonna pack leftovers around all night!  After we ordered, the server at the table next to us went through the available preparations with his table, and after hearing them, I would have definitely liked to try several of them.  I was very disappointed by our server.\n\nAll in all, the food is delicious, but good food is not hard to find in Vegas.  The service is a big part of making a great meal, and this was lackluster.  Not sure I would return or recommend this restaurant, with all the great options in this town."

            "review": "If you're short on time and/or simply not a big fan of the written word, let me start this review with all you really need to know about Mastro's: BUTTER. CAKE.  That's it.  5 stars for the best cake I've ever had.\n\nOk, now on to the merely trifling details.\nI made a reservation several weeks in advance as my boyfriend and I were headed to Vegas on Labor Day weekend for his birthday.  I requested a table in the \"tree house\" (I called it the birdcage or something equally gauche) and noted the occasion.\n\nWe arrived and were told they were preparing \"one of the best tables\" in the birdcage--that we could sit at the bar for a few minutes or be seated promptly at another table.  Obviously we hit the bar which, it bears noting, is visually interesting with a HUGE inventory of top shelf liquors stacked all the way to the ceiling.\nI had the Mastro's Martini--Belvedere vodka with handstuffed blue cheese olives.  Sweet jesus.  Hands down, best martini I've ever had.  Three days later, I'm still thinking about those olives.\n\nDidn't even finish my drink before the hostess, a sweet, bubbly thing, took us to our table.  Situated on the perimeter of the birdcage, it was a great table.  Yes, it's a mall, so our view included Louis Vuitton and a hoard of assholes who had just evidently exited the Elvis show but, whatever.  It's Vegas.  Plus, I liked the change-up from the normal casino venue which meant I got non-smoky air for a full 3 hours.\n\nOur meal, start to finish, was fabulous, perhaps only outdone by the impeccably rendered service.  A special shout out goes to our main server, Matt, whose plesant demeanor, attentive service and knowledge of the menu (and wine list) were truly something special.\n\nWe started with a custom seafood tower.  Wanting to save room for the steak, we went modest with 3 shrimp (HUGE), an order of Dungeness crab cocktail (the best cold crab I've ever had) and 1/2 dozen Kumamoto oysters.  The dry ice effect and caper berry garnish were nice touches but the star of the tower was the hand grated horseradish.  When was the last time you noticed and RAVED about horseradish?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I will never buy the jarred stuff again.\n\nMoving on to the main attraction: I went with the 12 oz bone in-filet and boyfriend got the Kansas City.  We both preferred mine as it offered a better combination of buttery tenderness and intense meaty flavor.  He would do the ribeye if he had to do it over again but he was by no means dissatisfied with his steak.\nFor sides we selected snap beas, glossed in simple butter, creamed corn ,which mercifully left large kernels of corn intact, and an order of the matchstick fries (sans vinegar).\n\nTwo TINY complaints:\n(1) Upon seating, we received the \"Reserve Wine List\" which the BF deemed VERY high priced--not a single bottle under $100.  A few things we could buy for $150 at the store were priced at $900 and up.  1000% = excessive mark-up.  Nevertheless, he picked a nice bottle of red that he thought was reasonable.  When the menu came, about 10 minutes later, the left hand side had an enormous list of wines of the style and prices ($100-200) you'd expect at a standard steakhouse.  Would have been nice to have seen that list when we were ordering.  Might have been an isolated timing thing but worth pointing out.\n\n(2) Our first order of fries came out and were basically salt sticks.  And I LOVE me some salt.  I could barely eat these.  The manager came by and I made a casual comment about them.  He said he'd have the kitchen do a fresh batch but would leave us the salt bombs until the new batch was ready.  VERY nice touch, in my opinion.  Because of course we kept eating them.  Second batch was perfectly seasoned and the manager seemed to recognize that the kitchen can get a little heavy handed with them.\n\nThese two missteps in no way took away from how much we enjoyed our experience at Mastro's.\n\nLast but NOT least (since it already got a plug at the outset of this review), Mastro's blew us away with the complimentary butter cake--served on a personalized plate (\"Happy Birthday Rob!\").  I've since seen some recipes for this cake and I'm really sorry I did.  I could hear my arteries clogging as I ate this, but man it was worth it.  One of those items where you take a bite, laugh at the insane delectability, take another bite, and chuckle some more.  For me, there is no better mark of good food than laughter. \n\nI found the prices high, but totally on par for what I expected in Vegas.  And, in fact, to the dollar, the amount we spent on Nobu the night before (with cocktails but no wine).\nWe'll definitely be coming back here.  And will hopefully be seated in Matt's section.\nOh, and the table next to us (3 couples) spent most of the evening talking about bra sizes and dirty Sanchezes.  Can't beat that for entertainment."

Allergies make life fun. \n\nWith that in mind, I'd actually be giving this place a 4/5, but I can't say that as everyone came out very happy, including myself. The only drawback I had was the steak, an 18oz NY Strip on the bone that was nothing particularly special, but definitely adequate. When I say adequate, I mean a steak I'd expect to get at a mom and pop 'steakhouse' in the midwest, not one of the nicer places in Las Vegas. \n\nMastro's has one of the coolest locations in Las Vegas. The exterior bar in the Crystal Shops is flanked by retailers like Audmers Piguet, Tom Ford and Richard Mille....I mean, its hard to walk into the restaurant when so many cool shops are right next to it....but hey, that's neither here nor there. It actually has nothing to do with the review, I just love watches. Actually, the interior design probably plays into other people's reviews, so...uh...idk, 5/5? Would interior decorate appreciate again?\n\nThe staff was amazingly attentive, down to Earth and incredibly good at their jobs. I was incredibly impressed with the knowledge of the somm, and our waiter was very, very good at his job. \n\nEveryone got appetizers, the foie gras was incredibly good...and I foolishly shared with another at the table. Given the portion was like 2 bites in total, I got one. Still damn good. \n\nDinner came; steak was decent, potato was...well, a potato...hard to do anything with a simple starch that would be categorized as amazing, but it was an overall good meal. Everyone at the table raved about their seafood though, like...they loved the place. \n\nIf you're still reading this, ha. But yeah, I personally think 4/5 due to 'meh' steak, but overall I'd definitely come back for the great staff, great location and great wine list."

            "review": "Before heading out for a night of partying at XS, my buddy and I found ourselves wandering around the Cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  While the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  Well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  Hoping for better luck at the mall at City Center next door, we eventually worked our way over to Mastro's Ocean Club to check things out there.  Greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  Score for table seating by the bar!\n\nFor a while now, I've heard a number of good things about Mastro's from friends in LA.  From the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  At the end of my meal, I could certainly see what they mean.  After perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, I ended up going with the grilled Chilean Sea Bass with a side order of the Garlic Mashed Potatoes for my friend and I to split (rather, I wanted it for myself, but needed to \"share\" it to justify getting it).  Now, I know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to Mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  However, given that it's one of their two Ocean Club spots, I figured that maybe I should give the seafood a shot since I don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.\n\nWhen our orders were brought to our table, I have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  Although the cut was larger than I had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  Since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  Despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  Although Chilean sea bass is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  The meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  Flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  Excellent.\n\nAs for our sides, the Garlic Mashed was pretty good.  I liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  While I would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the sea bass.  In addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a \"basket\" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  The order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  All of the ones I tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.\n\nAs for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  Our server Sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  Now, I'm sure that last part MIGHT have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  While it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, I really liked the vibe of the place.  The main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  While the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group.\n \nWhile I do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, I have no complaints about what I had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  That said, I know I'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their \"tree house\" section.  Great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  But then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too.."

I made reservations online, and called ahead to request a seat in the treehouse. \n\nService is impeccable here! Everyone was super nice and friendly. We started with the lemon drop dry ice martini and it was possibly the coolest (pun intended) alcoholic drink I've ever had! The dry ice fizzles over the top and there is a mini tornado in your martini glass!! It tasted great as well! Perfect blend of sweet and tart - with, of course, a kick of alcohol!\n\nTo eat, I ordered the filet mignon and we split truffle gnocchi, lobster mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas as sides. My steak was perfectly cooked, silky and tender. The gnocchi and mashed potatoes took it over the top to glutton overload. Those dishes are soooo richhhh and decadent and creammmyyy. Yum.

The seafood tower is a fun thing to order with the dry ice making a cool effect at the table. On the 2nd night we hd a group of 15 and they put us in a private room which was nice. If you need to make a large reservation ask for Carly... she was very helpful!"

The steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and all topped off with their truffle butter (highly recommended but an extra $15 add-on, I know. I can buy a lot of butter for $15, but worth it). Yum! Also ordered a fairly large seafood tower. It was stocked with lobster, large crab claws, oysters, crab legs. Can you say, Unbelievable! With our steaks, we ordered the following sides. Creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and the gnocci. All amazing. Obviously the price here is fairly hefty but was well worth it. Impeccable service with our waiter anticipating our every need. We ordered so much food that they ultimately comped us on a free desert. Way to go Maestros. Will most definitely come again!"

The meat is always good buuuuut well the sides in my opinion leave a little to be desired. One flawed menu item is the vanilla battered lobster tails. Like a frigging lobster funnel cake. A light tempura type batter would be a better choice, it was the first time I have not finished a lobster tail. Ah well, lesson learned."

I made reservations for a group of friends and I, and despite some initial resistance from my fellow Yelper Lauren M., we all had a fabulous time and were more than happy with our decision to come here!\n\nOur server, Lionel, was amazing the whole evening. He was friendly, helpful, and attentive. He recommended we get a customized seafood tower, and everyone in the group was very impressed.\n\nWe were also impressed with our meals. I got the bone-in filet, and two of my friends split the tomahawk special. My other friends got fish. My filet melted in my mouth and was cooked perfectly. I don't typically get filet when I go to a steakhouse, but I was so happy with my meal! \n\nWe also got the very popular lobster mashed potatoes for a side, and it was delicious. Lionel brought us out some of the warm butter cake for dessert, and it was amazing! You could definitely smell the butter as soon as he put it down on the table. You must try it if you come to Mastro's!\n\nThe setting is a little weird, as you are essentially in the middle of a mall. Honestly, the food was so good that I could have been sitting literally anywhere and enjoyed this meal!"

The Twin lobster tails were lightly steamed, preserving their delicate texture and softness! Tasty Garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were the perfect complement to the proteins.

Kudos to the entire staff and management are due. We walked up to the hostesses and we were welcomed by big smiles. Then off to the table, from the bar, and the hostess carried the drinks for us.

It's always great to see them work together as a unit and are attentive to the guests. The glasses are never empty, offering of seconds on drinks and breads are consistent. \n\nThe waiters are very knowledgeable of their products. They know exactly how the meals are prepared and the taste of each item on their menu. They also offer great advices on how to maximize the flavor and food experience. \n\nThe side dishes are large enough for a party of 4 and the main course itself are large enough to satisfy your hunger.\n\nI have to be honest, the last time I was here, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and I was underwhelmed by the preparation. With that said, I wanted to give another fish another try since they are after all, the \"Ocean Club\". I  ordered their feature of the day, the halibut which comes 3 ways: pan seared, cajun/creole rub, or breaded. With the suggestion from the waiter, I chose to go through the pan seared route. It was a good size fish, served with tartar sauce on the side. The fish was prepared nicely. It was flaky and juicy. However, again I was underwhelmed with the flavor. In my opinion, it was bland and flat. The tartar sauce didn't do anything as far as offering another dimension on flavor. \n\nMy friend ordered the lamb chop and he was not impressed either. It was prepared well, pink in the middle and tender but he said he was expecting more flavors.\n\nThe other friend ordered a tomahawk steak and it was big! He said it was good and flavorful. From the look of it, the meat was prepared well also. Perfectly pink in the middle throughout. He said it was good but had better. \n\nMy bestie ordered a wedge salad (of all the great options...she gets a salad!). She said it wasn't impressive. Just another wedge. Although she did mentioned that she liked their blue cheese crumbles. \n\nThe lobster bisque was very rich in flavor and had a lot of lobster chunks. I love a good lobster bisque...but the cream was a bit too rich. I wouldn't have been able to finish one by myself due to its richness, good thing it was split in half.  \n\nThe lobster mashed potatoes were full of flavors and is extremely rich in butter and cream. It was served onto our plates by the host. The sugar snap peas were very tasty and had the perfect crunch and bite to it. The fries were just fries. \n\nWe were all too full to order a big dessert, I really wanted to order their butter cake but couldn't bring myself to do it so we ordered the creme brulee. It was served with a big bowl of homemade whipped cream and was a good compliment to the dessert. The brulee was sweet and the cream was not which balanced out the flavors nicely.\n\nOverall, it is a great experience but I don't know if I can justify eating the fish here."

I was craving some crab so I had 2 king crab claws of the appetizer menu.  Wow!\n\nOf course you can't go to Mastros without having Butter Cake.  OMG!

I also had the Ceasar salad, mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes and butter cake for dessert. Everything was great, but the steak, ahi and mac and cheese were phenomenal. \n\nThe place is cool. We sat in the tree dome looking section. It's also nice to have Tiffany's and Louis V. right next door.\n\nOur table was up against another seating booth which I didn't like. I don't like strangers so close to me, especially when I'm eating. Don't want to listen to them and I'm sure they don't want to listen to me. Service was decent, but they were busy."

When I first arrived, I was greeted by the front, she showed me to my table.  while walking towards our table, i was greeted again by another waitress passing by us.  when i arrived at the table, the front service didn't even bother to pull the chair for me.  The restaurant had unique architecture design. I looked around our table and noticed there were a lot of ... gold diggers in the restaurant. Lol table next to me were party of two females, they were trying to hit on \"johnny depp\" look a like singer/musican at the restaurant.\n\nI ordered bone-in ribeye, sweet potato fries, and calamari for appetite. Few minutes later, our waiter brought 4 different types of cold bread. Petzel, fried, chatula, and other bread I can't remember. I wished the bread was warm it would have been better.  Finally after waiting 10 minutes, our calamari came out.. damn it was salty.. I couldn't finish the calamari, it tasted straight out of ocean.. my steak came out sizzling on hot plate and sweet potato fries were in big basket enough to feed party of 4.  First bite of fries were... f&ck its salty..  now on to the steak... omg the chef has lost his tongue... its also super salty...  and outside was a little overcooked, it had the crispy burned taste.  well ..that's end of my story.. the food was soo salty, I gave up trying to finish $100 meal.. chef probably thought that i was exposed to japanese nuclear radiation and i needed extra iodine in my thyroid. the waiter couldn't keep up refilling my water.. i ended up drinking total of 4 cups of water. my worst preminium steak house experience."

Last year our service was so over the top, the food so good, and the unique ambiance made it a great meal. \n\nIt was still a great, er good meal. We arrived at 7:20 for our party of seven reservations. Both cabs got lost. \n\nWe were seated at 8:30. The management seemed unable to deal with people camping at the table. We suggested they offer to buy them a drink at the bar l get them off their butts and get out!!  Once we were seated, we had the wonderful seafood tower. Our wait staff was good, not great (like last year). Examples is very pedestrian descriptions of the specials or main dishes. Our waiter went through the list rote. Our meals were deliverd together, but several times we had to ask for water, the bus staff made comments and interrupted conversations with their removal of plates. I think bus boys should not participate in table conversation, unless asked. \n\nMy bone-in strip steak, ordered charred medium rare was neither, and NOBODY askede if I was satisfied with the steak, which surprised me.  My steak wasn't charred and it was rare.  I know, some people say medium rare and really want medium. I know the difference. I like 120 to 130 degrees max. My steak was rare or actually cool and uncooked in the middle. I'm in the food business and actually run a meat wholesaler. My steak was just so-so, it had some tough parts and the undercooked aspect make me leave at least 30% of the meat on the plate. \n\nThe gnocchi and the lobster potatoes are worth the trip. \n\nI'm not sure how to avoid the hour wait for a table, but it was frustrating. \n\nLast year it was a 5 star meal, but due to average service, the long wait, my steak being undercooked and average quality, it was a 3 star night, and it was over $1,000.  Ouch."

It's easily enough for 4-5 people or one person who's been jonesing for this cake. \n\nTheir wine list is well chosen and a pretty good value as well, all things considered. I had a French Cremant & for $10 it was an extremely generous pour."

This is now my local Mastro's for the time being, so my boyfriend and I decided to have a nice Valentine's Day dinner at Crystals.\n\nAll-in-all, as with the other Mastro's, the food and service are top-notch.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and patient; other waiters provided the same level of attention to us even though they weren't assigned to our table.  Like always, we shared a 22oz ribeye, and a side order of Alaskan king crab gnocchi with black truffle.  We grabbed a second order to-go because we love that dish that much.  For Valentine's Day, we also got a complimentary order of Mastro's signature warm butter cake, which is incredibly sweet and rich.  Love it.\n\nMy only complaint is the atmosphere of this location.  The main dining room is located in an open-air treehouse structure inside the Crystals mall.  Although for Valentine's Day we were seated in one of the private dining rooms upstairs, I would imagine the atmosphere between the two is similar.  I dig the dimly lit, quiet, romantic ambience of the Costa Mesa steakhouse.  Since this location is in a mall and (mostly) open-air, you get ... a mall atmosphere.  Which is okay, but not optimal.  There also seemed to be a lot of very loud, drunk people at the restaurant, but I figure they're everywhere on the strip on a Friday night."

I've eaten here multiple times over the past 3 years, and that's says a great deal because the Strip has so many fine dining options. I've actually had the same waiter, Mike, a couple of times. His knowledge of the menu, and service to our table couldn't have been better. \n\nMy favorite entree is the Fillet of Arctic Char Oreganata style. This is a flavorful fish like sockeye salmon or snapper, not bland or mild like grouper or cod. The portions are large at Mastro's, both the entrees and the sides, and this dish is no exception. They serve 2 fillets of fish. There must be 12 to 14oz of fish on the plate. I've ordered steak here once as well, an 8oz petite filet. Is was excellent, cooked perfectly, as one would expect at a high-end restaurant. \n\nFor desert, I recommend sharing the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake. It has an amazing smooth and warm buttery taste that intensifies as you near the cake's center. \n\nLastly, with regard to the dining experience, the restaurant is located in the Crystals Mall, however, there is no \"mall-feel\" to the experience whatsoever. The wooden \"tree house\" dining area is an impressive sight to see, and a truly unique and beautiful open-air room to dine in."

The hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  They kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.  \n\nWe started with two cups of coffee and the Dungeness Crab Cocktail.  The crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.\n\nFor dinner my wife had the 8oz. Petite Filet and I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  The waiter, Piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  We chose the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and the Steamed Broccoli.  My wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, Piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  When it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  My Sea Bass was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  The Lobster Mashed Potatoes has spoiled me, now I find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.\n\nAfter dinner they brought out a complimentary Chocolate Sin Cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.  \n\nOverall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  My only regret is not being able to try the Warm Butter Cake everyone raves about, but I guess that means I have to go here again next time."

There was a bit of a mix up with our reservations (I used open table) but they were still able to accomodate us.\n\nMastro's is located inside the Shops at Crystals on the second floor. My boyfriend loved his Hennessy sidecar cocktail and always talks about going back just for drinks and to try their dessert.\n\nWe decided to skip appetizers and just go straight into the main course. We got the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye, the ahi tuna sashimi, lobster mashed potatoes, and sauteed broccoli. Since we were sharing, they offered to plate and serve everything for us. We ordered with the intention that the tuna would be for me, and the steak would be for him but by the end of the meal, I enjoyed the steak so much I ended up eating most of it. I'm a fan of ribeye steaks because i find them to be more flavorful than filets - and the steak here had a nice sear on the outside and perfectly tendor on the inside. The lobster mashed potatoes were yummy but a little bit salty to me (although my boyfriend said it was fine and he loved it). The amount that we ordered was more than enough for two people, we didn't get to dessert because we were so stuffed."

True aficionados do not limit themselves to one choice. They are so in love with the subject they want to learn everything about it. So when you ask me for my favorite steak be prepared for a long response. I might ask you what you've liked in the past and what you look for in a steak. There are so many ways to prepare a steak that it can't be drilled down to just one ideal steak. \n\nWith that said, Mastro's did not disappoint. It has made it on to my list of high quality eats.\n\nWent on a Saturday night so it was very busy. However the service kept up with the demand quite well. There is a bar with live piano music where you can wait while they prepare your table.\n\nWe ordered the seafood tower with oysters and shrimp. Other available choices were lobster, caviar and crab legs. No complaints here. Just great tasting, fresh food.\n\nI wasn't in the mood to have the meat sweats later so I ordered the modestly sized bone-in filet, medium rare. I judge a steak by how it's cooked more than anything else. I like mine almost rare and it was cooked as requested. Highly recommended. Other steaks at my table were the Tomahawk Wagyu Ribeye and the Ribeye. The steaks are huge so plan accordingly if you want to order sides and dessert, and you should.\n\nAs for side dishes we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes had a whole lobster mixed in it and topped with a sauce flavored with the juices from the lobster. Most creamed spinach I've tried in the past were way too buttery but they nailed it here. More cream than butter so it remained thick and didn't fall apart.\n\nThe service was first rate as expected for a joint like this. Our waiter, Craig, was professional and gave us a great tip when we asked if he knew a place to get cigars afterwards. \n\nTo top it off the hostess sent us a butter cake on the housel! I normally don't order dessert but this cake changed my life."

            "review": "I was out here celebrating my birthday for the second straight year (yes, it's clich\u00e9 - I'm perfectly OK with that) with my baby brother. We wanted steak, but didn't necessarily want to spend an arm and a leg. Well, we succeeded at the former, if not the latter, but we left very happy and very, very full.\n\nWe settled into the bar and I asked the bartender about the dry-iced martini. It was at that point I discovered the bar was much more about the fufu martinis rather than classic. I'm partial to the classics, so I was a bit disappointed. That said, that's E-Me - I should have checked out the menu in advance, or read a couple more Yelp reviews. (Take note if you're looking for a classic cocktail here, you won't find it.) I wound up going with the on the menu manhattan, which was very good, but not great.\n\nNow it was time to settle into the real reason for going - meat. We had a bit of a conversation with the very friendly bartender about what was good and must-haves on the menu. We already knew we were having the bone marrow, which she did recommend. We talked steak and sides, when she insisted we have the brussel sprouts. Now, I'm not much of a brussel sprout fan, but given the recommendation that was given I figured we had to have them.\n\nThe bone marrow came out and it was two huge bones. I could have slid down them - I'd have been a very happy man if I had. The marrow was plentiful and delicious. You won't have to scrape just to get a little, you'll be scraping just to get the last little bit of all that wonderful marrow goodness.\n\nNow for the steak. I did the bone-in ribeye, which came out perfectly rare - if not maybe a touch too rare, which is very weird for me to say. That said, it was amazingly flavorful and near melt-in-your-mouth. And the brussel sprouts - well, I'm not a true convert yet, but if you keep serving me more like these I might change my ways.\n\nThen, on to dessert. A huge, and delicious, butter cake. We couldn't stop eating it despite the fact that we were absolutely stuffed.\n\nIn the end, and for the money, I do think there are better steak experiences to be had on the strip. That said, you absolutely can't go wrong with a stop to Mastro's."

            "review": "My wife and I are visiting from Austin for my birthday and wanted to have a special birthday dinner.  I checked reviews in yelp for a good steakhouse and came across this restaurant. I had not heard of it before but when I saw the very high ratings decided to give it a try. All I can say is AMAZING!  The service was excellent!  Make sure you ask for Mike. He was a excellent waiter. He took his time answering all of our questions and his service was prompt and personal. The food was super delicious.  I had the ribeye cooked hard medium. Talk about juicy and full of flavor! I'm a firm believer that a good steak does not need steak sauce and brother let me tell you absolutely no steak sauce needed. Same for my wife, she had a filet (Oscar style). I paired my steak with a grilled lobster tail. OMG, talk about good. For our sides (ala cart) we had the saute asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. Both very flavorful.  We paired our meal with wine. I had a perfect balanced Summerland Pinot (flavor was heavier than some Pinots but not as heavy as a Cab). My wife had a Jaylor Cab (pretty sure I spelled it wrong). She loved it with the crab and steak.  By the way the crab meat was large whole chunks.  Amazing!  For dessert Mike brought me a smaller version of their butter cake. OMG, OMG!!! I'm a huge chocolate fan and very rarely do I eat anything else, but this cake was phenomenal.  You have to try it.  That's all I will say. \n\nAnyway I hope this helps. You can not go wrong with this restaurant.  Heck, we initially sat behind Shania Twain but moved because other people in her party were a little loud and we wanted a quiet dinner experience.  From what we were told, they always have celebrities visiting. \n\nForgot to mention that we stayed at the Aria.  Which is right next to the Crystal Shops, where the restaurant is. Check them out too. \n\nEnjoy!"

Service was also up on par with other fine dining restaurants.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if all these are worth the week long food poisoning torture I have to go through. I nearly missed half of my Maroon5 concert that was right after the meal. Still carrying stomach ache as I'm typing this review. After finding another reviewer's complaint about food poisoning at Mastro's after ordered the same plate sea bass on Trip Advisor, I figured I should share my experience and warn the yelpers.\n\nBeing a sushi lover (eat raw fish almost every other week if not more often), I consider myself a foodie with a tough stomach. However, my trained stomach cannot win over this meal. My husband and I shared every other plate except for the entr\u00e9es and the cocktails and he turned out fine. (For the record, I ordered pan seared sea bass and dream berry.) So I'm guessing it's either this sea bass that still cannot rest in peace and enjoys surfing in my belly, or it's the berries used in the cocktail that may not be as fresh as these should be.\n\nTried to contact Mastro's but so far no luck. I will follow up with an updated review if I do hear back from Mastro's."

So of course being the steak lovers that we are, we had to try this place out! We ordered two crab cakes, a steak entree for myself, fish fillet for the hubby & lobster mashed potatoes for our side entree to share. The crab cake appetizer was packed with ample crab meat; though I did feel that it lacked a bit in flavor. There was a side of greens topped with avocado which I didn't think complimented the crab cakes very well. The 22oz steak was DELICIOUS and yep, you bet I finished all 22oz of it! NOT! This hunk of meat was humongous and of course I shared it with my hubby! It was cooked to perfection at medium rare; nice and tender! Served sizzling hot on a scorching plate; I devoured every bite of my steak! My hubby's halibut was very good; soft and tender with a nice creamy sauce mixture. The lobster mashed potatoes was good. It was also super creamy with a hint of garlic. They weren't too generous with the lobster meat but  I wasn't expecting much beforehand.\n\nService here was definitely not up to par. Considering I had made reservations at 8:30pm TWO WEEKS prior to our arrival, I was hoping that we'd at least have to wait for ehh, maybe a good 10 minutes. NOPE. We were running a bit late that night and I called the restaurant at 8:15 to inform them that we were on our way and the lady confirmed that our table will be waiting. We get there around 5 minutes pass our reservation time (not as late as we thought after all!) and the lady tells us that it's actually going to be another 50 minute wait!? WHAT?! Though she did apologize that they were behind schedule, apart of me was just a wee bit frustrated. She should have at least have the decency to let us know ahead of time when I phoned in so we didn't have to rush over! Well nonetheless, we went to the sushi restaurant next door and surpassed time at the bar. \n\nThe treehouse architecture of this restaurant is out of the ordinary and quite astounding! Built inside the Crystal mall - it has a unique structure to it. Entrance is accessible through the second floor; the restaurant is built from the 1st ground floor up.  \n\nAll in all, my hubby and I had a very scrumptious and fulfilling dinner together! I would highly recommend for all steak-lovers to be sure to check this place out if they're ever in Vegas! :)"

But regarding the experience:\n\nFood:4 stars\nService: 1 star\nPrice:2 start\nAverage:2.5 star.. but I rounded up because my meal was courtesy of MGM... thanks casino host!\n\nI was seated by the hostess.. then I waited.. and waited... and waited.. for menus.  After making continuous eye contact with the wait staff, displaying my need for service, I was ignored.  Then maybe after 10 mins, I received a menu, but still had to ask for water.  Shocking, as this is supposed to be a nicer restaurant.. You would think with these prices, would come service.  Also, during our dinner, I had numerous times where I was looking an empty champagne glass.. and no I'm not a fast drinker... If you are going to place the bottle in a ice bucket stand on the other side of the table, please be mindful of when to fill my glass... I know this may sound snobby, but i have no problem pouring my own glass.. however, I believe they should keep a close eye, especially since there was plenty of staff just standing around.\n\nThe mussels were probably one of the best I've had! This was a nice surprise, as most steamed mussels are quite standard with white wine, garlic and parsley.  But this had some sort of light and creamy sun-dried tomato sauce! it was thin enough to compliment these under the sea delights, but hearty enough to dip with bread!  The crab cake was also divine!  Definitely no fillers here.. instead, a cake-shaped form of literally pure crab!  The Chilean sea bass was prepared really great, especially for a white fish!\n\nOverall, I would definitely check this place out, ESPECIALLY if you have a food/bev comp through MGM hotels.  However, I still prefer Sage over this place.  The service really stood out to me, and it was HORRIBLE!\n\nDear waitstaff.- please be kind to your customers, especially in the city of where splurge-worthy tips are common!  And to the tall, 60 year old server with some salt and pepper action going on ontop of that head.. stop winking at ladies.. you're creeping people out!!"

I decided to spend Valentine's day dinner here because oddly enough I live in Las Vegas and never been to one of my favorite hotel chains? What better else day to try it out right? Booked my reservation through opentable.com and actually because of the level of high priority reservations, I had to put down a credit card just to hold my spot. Reservation was for 9PM and once we arrived we were seated immediately which was great because I was starving! Things started off a bit rough for the experience but they made things right and THAT's the part that counts. I know what the quality of food should look and taste like because I dine at the one in Beverly Hills all the time. So for our order we went with the Tomhawk for 2 which was running for $115 and added on a lobster tail ($36) to go with it. The steak is obviously sharing size but the cool part is that they can cook it to the temperature of what each person would like. I am more of the medium and my partner is medium well. So when the steak came out it was incorrect and we asked to have blue cheese crust added which didn't get added and the mac n cheese came out sub par as well, very dry with just no taste! Not sure what the chef was thinking last night but anyways. The fact that I was able to pull the manager aside and address my concerns with the presentation of my meal left me satisfied because he actually cared and fixed it. I commend the him and the staff for going above and beyond to make things right. My Valentines Day meal will now be memorable! Shot Out To Dan! Thanks again!"

We had the ahi tuna and bone marrow appetizers and both were extremely delicious, the ahi tuna notable for its thick and generous cuts.

I love this restaurant.\n\nThe only possible knock is the dining room, although sleek and modern with an amazing architectural tree house in the middle, is in the mall.  Even though this mall has the highest of high end shops, it still feels a bit like your eating in a mall. No biggee for me, just something to consider.\n\nFood:\nSteak 5 stars - ribeye was an excellent cut and perfectly prepared\nSalad 5 stars - really simple but well done\nWine list and our selection - 5 star - great bottle at reasonable price\nDesert - butter cake?  10 stars - best desert I have ever had - our group talked about it the rest of the trip \n\nService:\nPolite, professional and well trained.  What you get in a AAA five diamond restaurant.  Mastros should be proud.  This is even more rare than great food.\n\nAmbiance: \nThe piano player, ultra modern dining area and spacious layout make this a great place for a business meeting, special occasion or date night.  \n\nOverall - awesome ++ Love it!"

To start off, my two older sons shared the Boston clam and chowder, I shared the lobster bisque with my youngest(soup portions are big enough to share), and my husband ordered the escargot. All of it was the bomb .com.\n\n\n   For the main course we shared the sides of corn in creme, mashed potatoes w/ lobster, and the best mac in cheese this world has ever seen. My oldest son got the bone in fillet, the best dish of the night.. (yes I said dish). I got the scallops as well as my middle one, perfectly cooked,and the sauce was heaven with the bread. My husband got the New York strip, which was cooked perfectly and very delicious!!!! My little one had a little of each of our plates ;).\n\n   The dessert was really good especially their signature butter cake. Service was amazing, and our waiter George was awesome.\n\n  Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club for the dining experience that I will never forget."

When you spend a lot of money at a restaurant you expect great service and our waiter stood around talking and laughing with other waiters and barely paid any attention to us.  Our drinks were empty multiple times for long periods of time.  Took him forever to take our order and acted like he worked at a dinner instead of an upscale restaurant.  I'm sure if we had a different server I would feel better about spending hundreds of dollars on our meal but we got what we got and unfortunately I have to base my experience on that."

            "review": "The food is spectacular and the butter cake is perhaps the greatest dessert I will ever have. The price is consistent with the food quality. I had the Chilean sea bass and mac and cheese w lobster cocktail as a n appetizer and the presentation alone was worth the price. Also their drinks are spectacular feel free to try all the concoctions as they are all spectacular. However the service does falter a bit. They waiters and waitresses come off as a bit snobby and at times seem to be bothered by talking to the guests. Again its not that the service is bad its just that for a restaurant of their caliber there is better. Also because of the design of the restaurant it does get a bit loud."

The lounge act was a sexy male/female duo who played the piano and had a swanky voice. (Most are not this pleasing to the eye.) The appetizers we tasted were incredible, especially the calamari and grilled asparagus. I loved the flair our bartender used and hope he did not mind our flaky decision making skills. Can not wait to go back for a full meal."

            "review": "We were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  After a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at Mastro's.  I can see why they had availability on a Saturday night.\n\nThe night started out really well.  The live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic Riesling.\n\nOnce we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  I had a spinach/bacon salad.  Nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal. \n\nFor the main course, I decided to try the vanilla batter twin lobster tails, because I read that it was a specialty of the chef.  I should have known something was up when the server also said I could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  I chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  The steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  The battered tail tasted like something from Long John Silvers.  It was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.  \n\nWe also ordered a twice baked potato to share.  This should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  They managed to do so.  My wife and I both commented that we get better twice baked potatoes from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  These must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  They were so dry, we could not finish it.\n\nWe had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  I'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  No refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  I did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.\n\nThe star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the ahi tuna sashimi.  It was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them."

The atmosphere is very inviting and romantic, and the servings are VERY generous. I was full after eating just bread, my appetizer, and side salad! Lol Our most recent visit was on Valentine's day evening. We were seated in the private dining area upstairs and were very pleased with the service. Our waiter was extremely friendly and informative if we had any questions regarding anything on the menu. The hostesses were VERY welcoming and easy to talk to over the phone when making reservations. Our most recent visit was fantastic! They even gave us a butter cake \"on the house\" as a thank you for visiting them on Valentine's Day (Score!). We had a wonderful experience and overall, the food, atmosphere, service, experience, etc, was all top notch! Highly recommended. \n\nThe ONLY thing I had a problem with, was halfway through our meal, we noticed there were so many servers and waiters, some of them stood around and walked around aimlessly (WITHIN the private dining area, instead of out in the hall) because, well... I don't know.. maybe they just couldn't find anything to do because there were so many of them? It made me a bit uncomfortable as I felt I was being watched or stared at. I'm sure this was due to the fact that Valentine's day was a busy one for them, so I'm sure it's not normal. But, still.."

My husband's lemon sole was over cooked and his clam chowder was just ok.  I had the tomatoes and buratta cheese.  The cheese was very good.  My lobster tails:  one baked and one in a vanilla batter were both over cooked.  We shared the Butter Cake which was good but not spectacular.  Along with this our service was horrible.  We had to ask for bread which eventually came had no butter with it.  We had a different person for each course and were totally ignored in between.  In the meantime a woman manager in a business suit and the waiter were busy fawning over the people at the next table.  Eat at Sinatra's if you want a first class meal and exceptional service.\nRenee P."

Everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions. Some of my favorites included the crab cocktail (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, lobster bisque (creamy and with actual meat), and the black truffle crab gnocchi. I had that night's special, which was a fantastic John Dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce. \n\nSome of the other \"little touches\" to make the experience better? The server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction. Very classy!\n\nExpect a hit to your wallet: Three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on Grey Goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster. I can assure you it's well worth it!"

Other items I would recommend are the shrimp cocktail, ahi tuna, and the cosmopolitan which is served with dry ice giving it an appealing presentation. The service here is the best and the food is amazing! I wish we had one of these in the 405, but until then, I will hit them up whenever I'm in Vegas or DC. If you visit the Vegas location, it is located in the Crystal Mall in its very own treehouse, which is very unique. There's no other place like it!"

EVERYTHING wasa absolutely delicious, and the staff is as professional as they come.  Unfortunately for me, after this visit, I fell ill.  I have no reason to believe it was because of Mastro's, but when they called to follow up on my dining experience, I told them, in the event others had also had issues.  They assured me they had not been aware of issues, but would talk to their chef, just in case.  They followed up with two more phone calls that rang true of genuine concern.  I live in the Chicagoland area and had no idea they had a restaurant in Chicago as well - if not for their phone calls, I may not know for a long time.  Class act, all the way around."
