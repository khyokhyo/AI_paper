I've worked restaurants before for many years and i never once left my customers waiting on my behalf. still a great place, maybe the staff needs to be changed again, at least they had good looking staff that loved where they worked prior to the renovation."

            "review": "Super disappointed in my take out. I ordered the oriental salad with the macadamia nut chicken and avocado egg rolls. The chicken was perfectly cooked and they did package it seperate the which I appreciated but the salad had no red cabbage, no almonds and about 4 pieces of shredded carrot and one piece of a red onion in it. The lettuce in general was shriveled and not very fresh. The avocado egg rolls which are usually my favorite were brown and soggy. I do realize they could become soggy if packaged too early but it only took me 5 minutes to get to my destination so seeing that my $30 dinner was of such low quality was a real disappointment. This place used to be up to par in every area and so far the past year or so has been disappointing nearly every time. Hopefully they get some better oversight going."

Drinks start off at $4.50, with a variety of mix drinks, sangria's, and wines.  There's a food menu as well with sushi, lettuce wraps, and sandwiches. The ambiance was great we decided to eat upstairs since there was a big group of us. The waiter was amazing, and understanding. I wish I could've remembered his name but he was very polite and fast. We were able to the games, and socialize.  The food was awesome, and so we're the drinks."

So before you make comments about that statement, yes i did something for her that was kind of for me also. Anyways I headed over to opentable.com and aha they had reservations and they offer flowers to the table.... Nice touch. \n\nWe arrived at Kona and the place was packed.. We checked in and the hostess let me know it would be just a few minutes for our table and that was it. 2 minutes Later we were on our way to the table. The waiter was quick and brought us waters and greeted us with a happy mothers day shout out to Becky. Nice touch #2 \n\nWe ordered our daughters food when we ordered our Calamari appetizer and they came out at the same time... This is perfect and exactly why we do that. The waiter then took our orders and let us know that for moms there was a drink special... $2 bubblers\n \" Champagne Cocktails\"  so it was taken advantage of. We ordered the macadamia nut crusted chicken and the macadamia nut crusted chicken tacos. Both meals were nothing less than amazing. Mr. Waiter also asked right off the bat if we would like any extra sauces... Nice touch #3\n\nAs we were finishing up the delectable meal he came back and said, \" by the way, you have a red velvet cupcake coming as well for free for mothers day\"  Nice touch #4. This thing was amazing, first off she loves red velvet cake and I love cream cheese frosting, so they pleased 2 eaters with one cupcake. \n\nI say Yes to Kona Grill. The food was amazing the service was prompt and precise, and they really did do the \"extras\" to make it a special mothers day. In my opinion I say try this place out and see if it something that is for you!"

The prices must of went up and they must have watered their drinks down. Their food isn't the greatest either. I always end up getting a funny feeling in my stomach after I leave."

I still can't believe the bill for 6 people was only $115.  We ate till we were all full and enough drinks AND dessert.  What more can I say?  Sweet & Spicy Shrimp are a standout.  But everything was good.  No complaints.  The Fudge Brownie dessert is enough for at least 4 people."

We were greeted with smiles and out waitress has excellent timing as well as shared a few laughs with us. NICE!!\n\nWe ordered a 5-spice Grilled Chicken BBQ pizza. The crust was light and crispy the way a pizza should be. The wait was amazing, under 15 minutes and the pizza came out. The sauce tasted more like Cattlemen's BBQ sauce then anything 5 spice but overall it was excellent.\n\nWill likely return for a more serious mean."

            "review": "I LOOVVEEE this place! I'm so glad that they have a location in Vegas. Kona offers a great mix of American & Asian food. Not to mention the best happy-hour.\n\nWe came here twice. The first time for their main restaurant which is decent, but you HAVE to try their happy-hour. I know that it's all day happy hour on Sundays too! I normally order the BBQ Chicken pizza ($6), fried calamari, lettuce wrap w/ chicken & shrimp, and a few of the rolls. I know some of their other locations offer the Atlantic roll (salmon roll) & spicy shrimp rolls. Everything is under $8 so you can get a healthy portion of food for cheap. It's best to go in a group so that you can get a real taste of their happy-hour menu. We didn't get any drinks so I can't comment about that menu. Just make sure to sit at the bar or outside seating for happy-hour prices.\n\nA must try: Japaleno Yellowtail Sashimi. This is a little pricier, but if you have never tried any version of this, Kona is a great place to start. They have the perfect ponzu sauce to go with the yellowtail. The jalapenos cuts all of the fishy-taste [which usually isn't present since their sushi is fresh].  I never ate sashimi before until I tried this very dish. \n\nEnjoy!"

Its deep fried goodness mixed with there yummy eel sauce was a perfect combo.\n\nOverall I had such a great experience here delicious good quality food, I loved our waitress she was so awesome and very attentive. \n\nI cant wait to return here"

It was my first time (as well as my boyfriend's first time) eating here and our experience was exceptional. Our server Zack was very friendly and helpful in suggesting food/beverages. He continuously checked on our table to ensure our satisfaction. Might I add that the Kona Chop is the by far the most delicious salad I've ever tasted, I'm most certainly going to return for more. I recommend Kona Grill to everyone (disregard the negative reviews), you be the judge of their outstanding restaurant."

I had never been so figured why not. \n\nPhilly Roll: didn't love it, didn't hate it... nothing to write home about. Disappointing for a place that has an actual sushi bar. Maybe I didn't get the right thing? I'm not too adventurous with sushi.\n\nPotstickers: Yes.. yes... and yes. Not sure what it was about these but I probably could have ordered 3 or 4 more plates. When I go back it will mostly be because I want potstickers. Nice size, tasty, nice crunch on bottom and soft on top. Nice presentation. Loved everything about these.\n\nChicken Satay: Very tasty... the peanut sauce was delicious.\n\nSat at the bar... nice spot and perfect day today with a bit of a breeze. All in all with couple drinks our bill was only $27 for lunch. Awesome... I'll take that any day."

Our waitress botched our drink order multiple times, but we had no recourse since they add 18% gratuity to parties of 7.  They even charged an extra $2 for adding ice to my scotch!!  The Omikase sashimi combo claims to have 18 pieces, but I counted 14.  What's with all the sauces?  They're trying way too hard with this: since when does sashimi need to be drenched in sauces?  Rather than accentuating the fish, the sauces ruined it.  Plus the pizza was greasy.  I won't be returning."

As I am sure you have heard before they have a GREAT happy hour, one I am a fan of! \n\nPatio seating is great, and yes even in the Vegas heat! They have a covered patio with misters that actually do what they are suppose to and keep you cool! During busy happy hour times (Friday nights) it does get a little tough to find a seat so I recommend going early to save spots for you and your guests. \n\nServers are always nice, especially one I have encountered a few times named Eddie. They usually check on your frequently without being overbearing. \n\nNow for the food and drink! I shall review happy hour first! \nSake bombs are a must and a steal at $7 for a large Kirin and large sake.\nThe margaritas are pretty delicious and strong too! \n\nFood recommendations:\n\nDEFINITELY my fave : ahi wonton crisps: fresh ahi seared and sliced on crispy wonton crisps drizzled with a wasabe dressing! YUM!\n-spicy tuna; cant go wrong with that\n-pot stickers come with a very yummy dipping sauce and are pan seared\n- barbeque chicken pizza is very generously portioned and can feed about 3 people ; a steal at only $6 \n- I would recommend just about everything on the happy hour menu! \n\nMenu food: macadamia nut crusted chicken is also a favorite, served with a good sized portion of mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Also the oriental chicken salad with the crispy ramen noodles is accompanied with a great sesame dressing.\n\nOverall- a must go/try for happy hour and regular menu food is pretty good too but I stick to the happy hour :)"

We ordered the ahi steak sandwich and the bbq chicken flat bread, both came out promptly and delicious! I'd definitely give that night 5stars.\n\nWe then saw a flyer for all day happy hour and football, so we went again today. It was a different vibe and service was not a attentive as the first time we were here. I don't think this place should even offer a happy hour with football, if 1. You can't hear any of the games, 2. There aren't enough tv's to enjoy all the games that Sunday has to offer. Also if you're encouraging football fans to come in, watch the games and have a good time, don't give them dirty looks when cheering on their teams.\n\nThe happy hour menu is decently priced with a couple good options. The avocado egg rolls are a must! And make sure that the dipping sauce is on the plate when you get it, cause when you ask for it the server said \"oh it wasn't on there?\" With a little attitude, if it was you think I'd ask for it? I used to be a server and before you bring any dish to a table you always make sure everything is on there correctly, especially if it's a normal dish that gets ordered multiple times a day. Also isn't it customary to offer waters to those who aren't having a drink? \n\nAside from the eggrolls, we ordered the calamari, bulgogi tacos and crab crunch roll. They were nothing special, I'd probably never order any of those again except the egg rolls.\n\nFor the experienced we got today, it averages out to be 3 stars for both visits.\n\nWe'll come back but never for a football Sunday."

However, I'll stay specific to the one in Las Vegas. Actually, this one is in Summerlin, which is in suburban Vegas about 15 miles west of The Strip. \n\nThe restaurant is more famous with the locals for it's bar and patio than it is for its actual dining experience and food. While it sits in a shopping center, it still manages to have a cool vibe. Also, exactly what in Las Vegas isn't in a shopping center?\n\nThe bar is open to both the bar and the patio on most nights and the patio that goes around the outside of the place is great for hanging out with friends and having some drinks. The drink selection is not fantastic, but is pretty average. \n\nAs for the food, everything I've had has been two things: delicious and uninventive. For a place that tries to have an asian fusion menu, I feel like I've either heard of or previously had everything on the menu. Which is fine, because its all very good. \n\nThe main steal here is if you come for \"Reverse Happy Hour\". This is a late-night happy hour in the bar area only where they have a ton of great pizza, sushi, and other appetizers for very, very cheap. For example, you can get a personal garlic shrimp pizza for $3.95. This is awesome as you sit outside on warm summer nights. \n\nThe hours for Reverse Happy Hour are:\nMonday - Thursday 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.\nFriday - Saturday 11 p.m. to 1 a.m."

The three girls in the front didn't help much at all and one didn't even seem to want to be there. That alone was off to a bad start... Then finally decided to get a table and that took some time and then finally sat. our waitress was attentive so I will add another star just for her. Food was all right, and the mojitos were pricey and could of been better. Wasn't able to be apart of the happy hour so that's that. \n\nPeople watched and notice the girls in the front seem to pick and choose who they want to help look for a happy hour table.

My only complaint is that the service can be over the place at times.\nI was there yesterday and we were not given silver wear even after the food was served . Had to ask for soy sauce couple of times before getting it . Happy hour is busy but that's not acceptable coz it has happened more than one time . All they got to do is to train the staff to pay attention to things like that and every thing will be great"

My wife and I have also celebrated a few of our birthdays and anniversaries here.\n\nThere are almost three distinct parts of this restaurant: a good amount of indoor seating, a bar that extends outside, with a decent amount of seating, and a small outdoor eating area.  Indoors is fairly quiet, the bar is typically noisy at dinner time, and the outdoor dining area falls between the two.\n\nIndoors is somewhat dark and comfortable.  There's ample seating and other than one time, we've always been able to walk in and get a table without a wait.  If you're going for a special day like Mother's Day, it's best to make a reservation.  The bar and dining outside are first come, first served.  Oh, for those transitional weather days when it gets chilly in the evening, there are heaters outside.  During the warmer times of the day, the seating is covered.\n\nThe menu is big enough that you'll find something (or a lot of things!) to enjoy.  There's also a fairly robust sushi bar with seating, or you can have any sushi creation brought to your table.  A respectable assortment of sushi rolls are listed on the menu.  There's also a great assortment of salads, soups, chicken, seafood, beef and vegetable dishes prepared the American continental way, or with a Hawaiian or Asian flare.\n\nGo and enjoy, swim through the menu, and see what you like.  And it's located in Boca Park, so you'll have some before or after dinner options for shopping or strolling there or just next door at Tivoli Village."

A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra\n\nOk back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.\n\nNow sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.\n\nWhat we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area.

It's about $30.\n\nThe best thing on the menu for meat-eaters is the pork chop... not something I would usually order in a restaurant but here... it's a yes.\n\nI love onion rings but they don't love me but if you eat at Kona Grill you are likely to see a large stack of onion rings go by.  I've tasted one and it was yummy.   On the appetizer menu of things I can eat I particularly like the avocado egg rolls.\n\nThe bar seems kind of like a pick-up joint but I enjoy the restaurant quite a bit and service is always good and a booth is almost always available."

When I bought my house in Summerlin, I drew a triangle between Kona Grill, downtown, and Steiner's, and I had to find a house in that triangle as I was working downtown and enjoyed frequenting Kona Grill and Steiner's.\n\nThat was 5 years ago, though.  Unfortunately Steiner's died down, and Kona cut back their hours.  I believe they used to be open until 2am on weeknights, and now they're closed by 11pm.  Kona does have a regular and late night happy hour, and there's plenty to pick from, so thumbs up for that.  Just don't trust their web site for the happy hour times... call first.\n\nFood is good, atmosphere is good, service is good.  Make sure you get Channelle as your server.  Really don't have too much bad to say about this place."

I used to eat here a lot for lunches, as well as frequent trips for the macadamia nut chicken. \n\nI went here with my friend who when we were dating loved the macadamia nut chicken, so we dropped in Saturday night around 730pm. They must have had a huge kids party because the place was packed with kids and parents, and had a buffet style set up in the middle of the room. It was ending, so the noise level went from loud to quiet in about 20 minutes.\n\nOrdered the mac nut chicken, with extra shoyu cream sauce. The chicken came out with very little sauce on it, and a minuscule amount of mango sauce. Lots of garlic chunks in the garlic mashed that really overwhelmed the potatoes. The veggies tasted a little burnt. The chicken was not as moist as before. I was actually pretty disappointed with the meal as prices have inched up, and meal quality has gone down.\n\nKudos to our server Jason who was fantastic and did everything right. Too bad he doesn't cook lol"

Luckily for me, I have Robyn and Kevin L. to show me around this foreign land. Summerlin might not be as exotic or far as I make it out to be, but I definitely need a reason to head over there. \n\nOn many occasions I was told about a happy hour that is worth checking out. It goes Monday-Friday from 4-7 and there is a reverse happy hour as well. Sit out on the patio, at the bar, or at the sushi bar and one will be guaranteed discount prices. \n\nThe drinks list is small, but the sake bomber is worth the $7.5. It is a full bottle of beer and a container of sake. One of my friends got that and I regretted getting a margarita. \n\nThe food is good, but what makes it better is the prices. Most of the basic rolls that run between $6-7 are half price. The same goes for select appetizers. The calamari are tender and delicious. Lettuce wraps are another bountiful choice that will surely please the taste buds. The specialty rolls are worth looking at for $6. \n\nWith the HH checked off my list. I must come back for their regular menu. Apparently anything with soyu cream is a must have and I must get some."

The patio + happy hour prices + their food is just so great. \n\nHonestly though,used to be a bigger fan before the remodel and prices went up. Still a great place, but just not the same. I used to love the contrast of the outside patio with the darker intimate inside. Now just looks a bit more like a typical restaurant/ sports bar. \n\nAlthough the price increases aren't drastic, the difference between $5 and $7.75 does add up. \n\nBut anyway... Their food is good and the vibe is great. Calamari has always been a fave, avocado eggrolls, sushi... It's all good. \n\nHappy hour all day on Sundays. Mon- Fri happy hour is 3-7 and 9-11.

What better way than wind down (or as I like to say \"wine down\"...get it?) the weekend or cure a hangover than with amazing food and alcohol at amazing prices? Rewind to before life got a little blurry yesterday and I remember how amazing the frozen raspberry margarita was. Then fast-forward to after my fourth one - they just kept getting better and better LOL. Before you think that this is what I do on weekends - it was actually an early birthday celebration for my girlfriend :) And Kona is honestly an amazing place to have an amazing time with great people, amazing food, and an overall amazing atmosphere (say \"amazing\" one. more. time). Our waitress was beyond nice and accommodating, there are misters outside since it's so hot, and for those of you who smoke, smoking IS allowed since it's outside seating.\n\nIf you've never been make sure to remember that it's first come, first serve so once you arrive feel free to grab a table :) I will obviously be back - this is kind of a tradition for my friends and I - and next time I'll upload photos.\n\nThere were five of us and our bill came to $130, so about $25 a person. That may seem a bit high BUT I know that between just my girlfriend and I, we ordered an entree and 10 drinks LOL. So no - it's not bad at all!"

Every night til closing, KF offers a wide array of sushi rolls, appetizers, flatbreads pizzas, and of course drinks and great prices. The sliders, and BBQ chicken flatbread are my personal favorites.  The sake bombs come with a large bottle of Kirin beer and a bottle of warm sake. Easily 3-4 drinks and a steal at $8. Happy Hour is only available on the massive patio and a few select tables inside by the bar. Though there are heaters, make sure you dress appropriately if you plan on dining on the patio. \n\nAs one the best late night spots in Summerlin, Kona is definitely worth checking out."

They have sake bomb kits which consist of the traditional small bottle of warm sake and a large bottle of Kirin or Kirin light. I take issue with them only offering Kirin as the complementing beer for the sake, but beggars can't be choosers. If you're on the southwest side of town, I recommend 808 sushi for sake bombs. ($6 for Whatever beer you prefer and the warm sake, whereas here it is $7.50 with only Kirin). Their sake sangria is tasty and refreshing. Their margarita is a margarita. (Tautological) \n\nI like their food specials. I recommend either the flatbread or the chicken/shrimp lettuce wraps. Most of these food specials can certainly be shared. \n\nThe ambience is nice and if it isn't too hot, the patio is a nice place to relax.

The sauces make it!!!\n\nChicken satay is really good too!\n\nFresh fish was a Lemon Snapper & was really delicious & super fresh tasting!\n\nWe finished dinner with desserts... Key Lime pie & Carrot Cake, both huge portions & super good!\n\nCocktails were really good too! Totally recommend this place!"

I had the Atlantic Roll and Fiery Shrimp Roll and they were both absolutely delicious, I could've eaten it all day. For dessert I shared the Ultimate Fudge Brownie and the thing is HUGE. Its a gigantic piece of brownie, with a scoop of ice cream on top and raspberries as well. There could have been a little more ice cream, but otherwise it was great.\n\nThe only downside was that the sushi order was messed up, and they brought the shrimp and california rolls, but they had out the Atlantic within 3-4 minutes."

Then, entrees arrived.. hubby's Grilled Ribeye Sandwich worked for him, but my Seared Scallops & Bacon with Citrus Aioli was beyond boring.  While I didn't expect much flavor from the scallops, there was absolutely none from the aioli, and barely any even from the bacon.  It was ridiculously tiny, four small scallops that were butterflied and then topped.. less food than any one nigiri.  I added a bit of lime juice from the plate decor, and that helped a teensy bit.. but not enough.\n\nIn the meantime, our server has disappeared on us.. we haven't seen diddly since our entrees arrived and I mentioned the vinegar overdose.  Neither of us had any soda left in our glasses, but nothing we could do about it.  \n\nWe finally flagged Justen down and requested our check, at which point he offered us soda refills.  Really?  There was no attempt to offer a replacement on the failed nigiri, there was no service while we were dining.. hope he enjoyed the tiny tip, as I deducted the nigiri from that portion of the tab.\n\nWill we return?  Nope.  One good nigiri and one decent sandwich doesn't make up for boring food and pathetic service."

Kona Grill is definitely going on my regular rotation.  \n\nI sat at the bar for happy hour and even though it was busy it didn't take long for a bartender to get me a water and a menu.  Since I hadn't been here before I ordered the lettuce wraps and Philly roll thinking they'd be on the smaller side; they were not.  The lettuce wraps were a perfect combination of sweet and savory and the Philly roll wasn't bad either.  I also had two Sangrias trying the sparkling and the red and both were tasty.   \n\nMy water glass was never empty long and I was quickly asked if I wanted anything else once my Sangrias got low.  My bill was waiting for me in a glass at the bar and once I pulled out my card it was quickly taken care of.  I couldn't really find any fault with my dinner and look forward to trying them again."

Really bummed out because we would come here every Sunday just about since they closed for remodeling and we would partake in the great happy hour deals. Sure the new decor is beautiful and contemporary and the choice of music is in good taste. I was so excited to go here since its remodeled new opening and so we went on a Sunday. I knew it was gunna be packed seeing as how its happy hour I made a reservation for 130 pm. \n\nUpon my arrival the 3 girls in the front looked at me like I had 10 heads when I said I had a reservation. There was almost no where to sit literally the place was nearly at full capacity. Finally found a table, and sat down. It took literally 15 minutes to even have the server come over and get us our water. I remained patient as they were slammed and this was the first Sunday since their reopening. It took another half hour to get 4 avocado rolls at which time I finally got the iced tea I initially ordered with my water. Our server said \"the tea is in the back\"\n\nThe entire time the server was cold, quite standoff-ish, just not friendly. Hardly seen the server the entire dining experience. Seemed like she had an attitude. No apologies for anything coming out late or her being gone half the time. Ok I get it your busy but come on at least acknowledge your patrons. The food finally came out. The kids meal grilled cheese waa a joke. Fries were overcooked and hard and the sandwich, well lets just say I wish I woulda got a pic of that. I was too busy taking a pic of something else ... \n\nMy lunch sandwich was fine until I nearly choked and cracked my tooth on a bone from the chicken. Talk about feeling absolutely disgusted. When I tell the server about what happens she has the nerve to ask me \"is that a bone??\" I had to bite my tongue with the response I had. Thankfully the manager rushed over and apologized and took it off the bill.\n\nAs a kona grill veteran I still dont like how u have to be outside or the bar to get happy hour deals. As full as the place was, everyone should be accommodated with that happy hour deal. \n\nEven after all this, I would probably give kona grill at least another shot. Just wont be for quite a while. *sigh."

I am very happy to report that this place is even BETTER now after its renovation, inside and out, complete with an addition of a bar/lounge on the 2nd fl terrace, accessible by stairs and elevator. The 2nd fl even has its own restroom. \n\nRATING: 5 Star for its new renovation; excellent food/drink offers, friendly and efficient service!  :-)   Go enjoy! \n\nDETAILS YOU CAN SKIP\n\nI had been out of town since Jan 2016 and just got back in town over a week ago. Last Sat, I came here for happy hour after a long walk around town and was totally blown away by this newly renovated Kona Grill!  I had a fabulous HH experience, and will surely be back soon for more, yes, for lunch and dinner, too!\n\nSpecifically, this completely renovated locale (re-opened in March) has: \n\n1. An expanded beautiful dining area, patio, bar counter and sushi bar\n\n2. An additional bar/lounge and restroom on the 2nd fl with elevator and stair access. The bar counter has 2 gigantic tv's. Most tables up there have a view. Yes, it has its own restroom. \n\nONE MINOR IMPROVEMENT NEEDED\n\nThis afternoon, although we could get the router signal, we WERE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET! I was told by fellow customers that the Internet connection that day was sporadic at best. \n\n05/28/16"

They didn't point us in the right direction or (god forbid) show us where it was in the oddly situated restaurant, so we wandered past the host stand and sat at the sushi bar. \n\nAfter we sat down we asked the sushi chef if happy hour was only at the sushi bar, and he said no, that it was also at the main bar and on the patio. The hostess could have told us this, or at least given us menus. We ended up ordering off the tiny happy hour menu that was already on the bar.\n\nOur server took FOREVER to take our order, and even longer to bring our drinks. They looked semi-busy so I can overlook this, but I was missing a share plate and chopsticks for half the meal, which I had to ask for twice. \n\nApparently a lot of people ordered sushi, but there was no food runner, so at one point there were TWELVE plates of sushi up in the window and no one to take them to the tables. During this time at least seven people walked by and did nothing about it. \n\nAt least the food was ok (we ordered the ahi tuna crisps, the spicy tuna roll, the wave roll and the apple Brie flatbread) and the sushi chef kept checking on us."

If you do eat here be sure to check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer or sushi roll! \n\nWe Ordered:\n-Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($11.25 free with the Yelp check-in though!) - I wasn't too impressed with this, the dip itself was a bit on the watery side.  I didn't even take the left overs home which is saying a lot because I always take home left over food if I can!\n-Classic Caesar ($5.75 for side size) - This also underwhelmed me too, the salad was underdressed and the dressing itself was a little bland.\n-Chicken Chili ($4 add on to entr\u00e9e) - The best dish from everything we ordered!  The corn bread was tasty and the chili was warm and filling.  I'm surprised with how much they gave us too for it being an add on side soup.  The mini cornbread muffins were delicious too the jalapenos in it gave it a nice kick.\n-Pulled Pork Sliders ($12.50) - This dish was good but just your basic pulled pork slider, what surprised me the most were the sweet potato fries usually I don't like them they were pretty good here the sauce that comes with the fries was to die for too. \n-Basil Pesto Linguine ($16.75) - I only had a bite of this but from what I tasted it was okay, a little on the bland side.

She seemed pleasant enough and warmly asked us what we would like to drink. She left and got our drinks and then returned with a root beer and a sierra mist with no ice for my fiance. My fiance let her know it was out of syrup and she apologized and quickly grabbed another. Note: We are both servers in town so we extraordinarily understanding of service type things because we do it for a living. We put in a order for two of the flat breads and our server disappeared and returned soon after with our share plates. Seems great, right? I thought so, up to that point. She came back and took our order, a burger medium well for my fiance with an extra side of mushrooms and onion straws so she could add them herself and a order of sweet potato fries. As for me I ordered three sushi rolls: a Caterpillar Roll, a Wave Roll, and a Soft Shell Crab Roll. We received our two flat breads relatively fast and were excited to try the new one we'd never had before. We already loved the Margarita one and were looking forward to trying the veggie one. My fiance mentioned to me that we needed salt and napkins. I looked around and saw our server talking to the booths next to us for quite a while each time. Again, understandable. We are servers also and understand some tables are more demanding or maybe they are just friendly. We waited for about 5 minutes until finally I caught her as she was walking by our table and asked for the salt and napkins. If I had not stopped her she would've been gone and I know this because I caught her at the end of the booth almost past us without her checking on us. She finally returned with our napkins and salt around 10 minutes later. I salted my flat bread and dug in. As usual it was tasty and my fiance really enjoyed the steak one that she got minus the bleu cheese. I started to run low on my bottled root beer and again I looked for our server and she was either nowhere to be found or she was talking to another table for like 3 plus minutes. This wouldn't bother me but she never once in our entire dinner did the same with us. We were treated as second thoughts and this was reinforced by our entire experience. My root beer finally ran out and I was starting to get annoyed. I set it to the end of the table next to the glass with just ice and watched her talk to yet another table for about 4 minutes. Finally she walked by and noticed my drink and asked us if we wanted refills. I ordered two root beers this time around because my pet peeve is to not have a drink while I am eating and I predicted I wouldn't easily get another root beer if I ordered just one. She brought these out and we went about eating our starters. We decided to behave ourselves because we had lots of great food coming and didn't want to fill up on the flat breads and that's when my fiance first noticed her burger sitting in the window. We could see because our booth was pointed straight to the kitchen. I took out my clock and marked the time, 7:24pm. The food and burger didn't actually get delivered to us until 7:32. Her burger just sat up there dying in the window. When our food was finally delivered they dropped the burger, fries, and the extra side of sauce that comes with the sweet fries and the server explained it was great. As for my food they plopped down the plates in front of me without ever identifying which rolls were which and then left. My fiance asked for some ketchup and mayo and the server returned with it rather quickly. My fiance was blown away by the size of the burger and despite being in the window for such a long time she said it was tasty. She did notice that the grilled onions that are supposed to come on the burger were not there but made peace with it. Our server did check back on us a few minutes after we began eating and asked us how everything was. This was the only time she came and checked on us until we were almost finished. Note: My fiance didn't know the grilled onions were missing until after this check back. We both enjoyed our food and watched what was going on around us as service industry people do. We both commented on how every single other table she had got loads of attention except us. Maybe she looked at us and thought, young, two top or maybe something else. In some way or form we were marked as being not worth while. We finished up and literally stacked our plates and silverware together so she would get the hint that we were finished and in her industry. She grabbed the stuff and came back a few minutes later. We got a dessert to go and our check. We liked the food and will return again in the future but we will never have this server again. I have referred to her as our server because until we got our bill and saw she had no name she told us. Our server's name was Hayley. Our entire experience was ruined by us being overlooked and ignored."

Along with all the blinding neon lights, she was blown away by a concept unheard of back East - the Reverse Happy Hour.  Soon she was happily scarfing down Ladies' Margaritas, pizza with goat cheese, and tacos unlike anything served in Mexican restaurants - big enough for a meal, accompanied by fried rice with fresh pineapple and shrimp, and for only 4.50 (okay, maybe 5 bucks tops) - at her favorite Happy Hour watering hole, Kona Grill.  Or was it the fabulous southwestern slaw?  The Princess was there so often, and had so many delectable and cheap dishes - and Ladies' Margaritas - that it's hard to remember what came with what.\n\nBut that was in the olden days, circa 2007. And a lot of that is gone.  First to go was the goat cheese on the pizza.  Then the garlic shrimp pizza.  The fried rice.  The slaw.  The onion rings to die for.  Gone, all gone.\n\nThe Happy Hour remains, though a ghost of its former self.  The margarita is the same, and only 50 cents more.  The 10\" pizza is still good, costs six bucks, but now only as a Pizza Margherita - with tomatoes, cheese and basil, BBQ chicken, or Pepperoni.  Not a bad deal, but not the pizza of blessed memory.\n\nTonight we managed to eat early enough to get to the first happy hour, before 7 pm.  Most of the patio heaters were working, and I had my Princess Cushion with me, to protect my Royal Behind from the hard, cold metal seat, so we were pretty comfortable.  My husband had a Blue Moon ($4, which I don't think is a great happy hour price any more).  I had the margarita, of course.  We shared the tomato pizza, which had a good amount of cherry tomato halves and shredded fresh basil, and also an order of Romaine Wraps, with chicken and shrimp in a mildly spiced sauce.  That was really tasty.\n\nIf I didn't yearn for the Kona Happy Hour of yore, I might have given this a higher rating.  What you get is still very good, and so is the service, which includes a last call for Happy Hour.  But it's hard to forget the glory that was Kona.  Maybe when the economy comes back, the goat cheese will, too.  I can only hope.  And then I will live Happily Ever After.\n\nThe End"

We also ordered the cheeseburger sliders which were too pink, and the fiery shrimp and crab crunch rolls which were just ok but nothing special. \n\nOur food was delivered before we received plates, so we had to get up and ask the bartender to provide some for us.

So I was eager to go back and find some of my favorite menu items.  \n\nMet some friends for Happy Hour then had dinner.  Started with our all time favorite Sake Bombers.  Our friends had never had one so we were obliged to show 'em how its done.  \n\nThe buzz kill was the table next to us full of a bunch bored out of their mind people.  They kept staring at us like we were crazy.  Sorry, but no excuses for having fun-especially when I get a night out with friends-which doesn't happen very often. \n\nAnyway, we ordered up a Crab Special Roll, California Roll and the Avocado Egg Rolls-all my favs-you can't go wrong, that's just how I \"roll\".  We sat indoors and an outdoor patio was available as well.  Happy hour prices are great, appetizers are half off.\n\nGreat friendly service and our waitress even recommended a great waiter named Chris and he was awesome too.  \n\nMy only disappointment was that they were not serving the Mahi tacos for dinner! Say what?  That's like the only reason I came here-boo-hoo.  They must have changed that because it never use to be the case. Being a total creature of habit, I mourned my tacos and then was forced to try something else.  The pasta with shrimp was fabulous, so I was not disappointed.  \n\nIt was quiet in the dining room not too many people on a Wednesday night. The Happy Hour is worth it with all appetizers being half off and the music was solid, I must have said, \"They're playing my song!\" like 10 times.  So I totally enjoyed the vibe and you could still hear the music where we were sitting for dinner.  I'll come back."

While the steak was cooked perfectly medium and juicy, there were no seasonings on it.  That was in direct contrast with the \"seasonal veggies\" which was just broccoli with 2 tiny pieces of what I think was eggplant...it didn't matter, because all I could taste was sesame seed.  I actually spit it back out. I've never done that before. I've also never left a large amount of food on my plate without requesting a to go box.  Waiter asked if I wanted one...I said no, told him I didn't like it because it was a bland steak and just not good.  He took the plate...no apology and no offer to make it right.  3/4 of that meal was thrown out and I still had to pay full price...$31! Plus the appetizer..my bill for just me...over $50.  1 star lost for the bad food and another lost for the lack of attention to my feedback about the quality of my meal.

You have to sit outside, and you have to stalk the area to find a table because their happy hour is no secret. It's still worth it though. I love their shrimp tempura, california, and spicy tuna rolls the most... so if you're a novice with sushi, those are a good place to start."

I went to Kona to meet up with a few friends and in the blazing heat of summer, I decided to sit outside amongst every table full of other patrons. I arrived alone and the host guided me outside to \"seat myself\" when I arrived I made eye contact with 4 servers who didn't appear very busy. 20 minutes later still not one server asked me if I even wanted a water. I then went up to the host and asked if she could send someone over. Very nicely. She said no problem they will be right over. Then the girls show up. I explained to them still no service I was parched. We gave them 10 more minutes and then asked the bartender to send someone. 10 minutes again. Still no menu, no waters, no service!!!!! They came from far and suggested Kona over many of others!! Never ever ever again! We got up and walked out!"

And if you are under 21 the ONLY place you can sit is at the sushi bar. I feel like it should only matter if you are 21 if you are sitting at an ACTUAL BAR. This is Kona GRILL not, Kona nightclub. Acting like this is Hakkasan or some shit. I'm 20 years old, I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm a child and need to be separated from other adults. I find this extremely ridiculous. Also it's nearly impossible to receive service. I sat for 10 minutes before a waiter even took my drink order. Our waiter wasn't even polite in the slightest. Every time I thanked him he couldn't even take the time to say you're welcome.The food is good and is the only reason I put up with everything. This is probably the reason I only come every once in awhile. My advice: appeal to EVERYONE, not just rich mid-life crisis summerlin old people that pretend to be young people. Also note that the price of happy hour has risen slightly."

It runs from I think 3-7 then again from 10-12 weekdays, Saturdays its during the afternoon (I can't recall the exact times), and Sunday it's all day.  I'd have to say that it gets pretty crowded during the Happy Hour times - especially if you're going during the week after work or something.  There's normally open seating at the sushi bar if you don't mind though.\n\nI like it here.  The food is a great value with their Happy Hour pricing.  They have a list of apps at half off and also some other items for 6 bucks... as well as some drinks for half off.  Their food is quality, ambience is great, service is not bad considering how busy it always is too.\n\nI've tried almost all the sushi on their Happy Hour Menu and to me, it's just OK.  Get the wave roll, it's pretty refreshing (I don't think it's a steal at 6 bucks though).  I also like the Crab Crunch I think it's called.  Other than that, I can't think of anything else that jumps off as awesome.   If you are looking for amazing sushi, go to a Japanese restaurant.\n\nMy favorite thing, however, is the two burgers for 6 bucks.  They are smaller sized burgers with a side of fries.  The meat is top quality and its its topped off with a bunch of great tasting things.  I like it and order this every time.\n\nI normally like pot stickers, but I'm not crazy about the ones here (my friends think opposite, they like them).  The meat in it is loose and doesn't stick together.  I think that's why it puts me off.  Anyway, the lettuce wraps are good, the calamari is good... everything is pretty good.  Not OMG, but good!\n\nThis is definitely one of the more generous happy hour spots in terms of their specials and times that they offer the great deals."

The bar - YES, but the restaurant..not so much.  We ordered the calamari and it was horrible!!! The calamari had no meat! It seemed like they scraped off the bottom of the fryer and served it.  I thought it had to get better, but then we ordered our entree.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I don't even think it was ribeye! I think a porterhouse or something, but definitely not a ribeye.  We also ordered a couple rolls of sushi which weren't bad, but my whole dining experience was already ruined.  My mom ordered their asian salad and she said it was too sweet.  The whole experience was horrible.  Our server forgot to give us soy sauce for our sushit and we waited quite a bit to get it. \n\nTowards the end of the meal I'm thinking I just wasted $100 on garbage!\n\nI'm going to take the survey tomorrow and hopefully it will change something. I really liked Kona Grill and I would like to return, but based on my last visit - I doubt it.\n\nIt may just be a hit or miss kind of thing and I hope that others don't have the same dining experience so don't go to this place expecting the worst.  I still have some hope for this establishment."

I'm known for being very picky about sushi, but I absolutely love their selection (they use a lot of great flavors and sauces, and it never tastes too fishy). The main menu has a lot of great options as well, and the happy hour specials are a really good deal. \n\nIt's also worth nothing that I've never had a bad server here. They're always so friendly and attentive."

Server checked on us about 3 times in a span of 1.5 hours.. my friend ask for water at the beginning of our meal, never got it, 45 minutes later she she finally went to the bar and got a water. Another one of my friends was holding the bill out for the server to grab and the server just walked by. If you're looking for somewhere to stop by for quick food this is not the spot."

I do have to say this time my experience was nothing to rave about. I will start out by complimenting the frozen margaritas which always deliver in taste and alcohol content for their very fair happy hour pricing of $5 dollars. I ordered the avocado egg rolls which are one of my favorite appetizers on their menu. The egg rolls wee not crispy as usual and the avocado tasted a bit on the stale side. The calamari was another fail as it was way ok salty and I was surprised at the fact that it came out of the kitchen within less than five minutes. Makes me wonder if I got a calamari order that was cancelled and sag on their kitchen until I ordered it. Also our waitress was not very friendly. I understand that servers are very overwhelmed during happy hour settings however the place was not busy to where she could have taken sometime to get to know us and be a bit more friendly. I am just going on previous experiences and how awesome their servers tend to be. I also ordered their flatbread pepperoni pizza which to me was very reminiscent of a \"lunchables\" pizza lunch. My humble suggestion to this establishment is to pay close attention to their food item consistency specially the staples that people love and come back for. I will be coming back and hope to see improvements."

On Saturdays, it runs from 1-5.  It's only offered in the bar & lounge area, which fills up quickly.  \n\nThe best dishes we ordered were the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Chicken Satays.  Loved the spicy peanut sauce that came with the satays.  The pizza is so filling!!  I'm gonna say pass on the sushi.  While it's really cheap @ $3/roll, it's not so fresh.  We tried an Atlantic Roll to which we both said \"Meh!\"  The spicy shrimp was pretty good, however their calamari wasn't so much. \n\nThey offer a house Chardonnay & Cab @ $6/glass during HH.  The Chard was not bad for cheap HH wine.  They also have a Sake @ $6/bottle.\n\nThe service is hit or miss.  We've had OK experiences and one horrible experience, but never fantastic."

I had not been here in years and they have totally revamped the bottom floor and in addition they added a second level.\n\nThis place has always reminded me of a meat market where those who want to be seen are present and looking to get lucky.....snicker, snicker!\n\nAs I walked in, I really like what they have done. The floor is open and no longer dark. I love the lighting and the decor. The main bar and the sushi bar are separate and both bars are set up in squares.\n\nOur booth was nice except is was right next to the cashiers area. Still no noise or interruption from the servers though. Our server was very nice and delivered great service to our table all night long. I wish I could remember his name as I would love to give him a shout out. I briefly mentioned to him that is was my friends birthday and he surprised her with a lovely dessert! He was the best! \n\nI ordered the Macadamia Crusted chicken with a creamy Shoyu sauce, broccoli and for dipping a mango/pineapple sauce. It was ok but nothing I was over the moon about. The chicken was flavorful but the dish came semi-warm. I like my food served hot. The best part about the meal was the free appetizer/sushi roll that you receive upon check in. At first, they tried to tell me that the check in was only for a free appetizer so I pointed out in black and white that it also listed sushi roll. They were happy to accommodate us. We also enjoyed a pitcher of their red sangria/sake. This drink was really refreshing on such a hot evening. \n\nOverall, the evening was a success but I can take or leave this restaurant."

And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.\n\nWe arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.\n\nWe were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:\n\n* Atlantic Roll \"Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce\" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!\n\n* Spicy Tuna Roll \"Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers\" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.\n\n* Kona Calamari \"Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.\n\n* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp \"Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon\" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.\n\n* Chicken Satay \"With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.\n\n* Avocado Egg Roll \"Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.\n\n* Kahuna Sliders \"A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese\" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.\n\n* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.\n\nWe didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.\n\nService was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)\n\nHappy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pm\nReverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pm\nFridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 am\n\nHH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.\n\nThey have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)\n\nYou can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!\n\nSide note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.  Don't go to the right side corner because you'll end up in the kitchen."

            "review": "2 words.. Happy Hour. Kona grills happy hour menu is one of best, calamari is a must and the rock shrimp and chicken lettuce wraps are a no brainer. At 6$ each your your fill, which is rare considering most happy hours leave you hungry and dissatisfied until you end up paying the price of a regular entree to get full. Kona is the complete opposite though, these 2 appetizers were enough to feed me and 1 other, and I can eat! If you really wanna test your stomach though and pass out, some other hh menu items to consider are their flat breads, and the ahi crisp (my favorite) but the ahi crisps are little bit smaller. The place gets packed pretty often but finding a seat is usually still pretty easy on the outdoor patio and the host is usually pretty spot on with their service every time I've been here. When ever I'm looking for a cheap meal on happy hour times, this is one of first places I suggest."

A second story was added and the previously dark dining room is now open and more complementary to the bar area.\n\nWhat used to be half price rolls are now $4.50 and specialty rolls $10 during happy hour. New happy hour menu items include lobster & tuna flatbread and BBQ flatbread. I think a few of the rolls are new too. I had the Kona chopped salad while we dined on the patio during my latest visit. The dressing was a bit overwhelming (honey mustard) and something more tangy would be my choice next time. There was a ton of chicken in the salad so props. Not too bad for $14. My white wine wasn't very cold so that happened. No props.\n\nGone are the awkward metal chairs and tables from the patio and in their place are stylish and softer chairs and tables and some firepit seating as well! Nice. Looks like Kona is set to remain Summerlin's best and most popular happy hour spot."

I didn't have my id which is understandable, so I took the liberty in sitting at a table to order a few food items off of the happy hour menu. My girl friends however, wanted to sit at the bar and have a shot and a martini. We had JUST ARRIVED. The bartender was not only rude, but was also discriminating against my gfs by refusing to serve them shots after he had already served them one round of martinis. They were not intoxicated by any means. We JUST GOT THERE. \n\nManagers, Janet and Ryan, were summoned and didn't do anything about the situation and instead decided to argue for at least 5 min over reasons we still don't understand. I'm just trying to order some food and my friends were just trying to have a good time but they got denied of their time. Even the group of older gentlemen sitting at the bar agreed that the service we received was uncalled for and discriminating. I have nothing else to say other than...\n\nMy server Nicole, on the other hand, was a delight. I had no qualms with her!!

When the weather is good, make sure to get there for happy hour, dig into a little sushi and their flatbread pizza is great. However, once you claim that outdoor seat, think carefully before you leave since the seating becomes rare as the evening approaches."

The place was pretty busy and we were still able to find a seat outside. It was a nice, cool day so being outside wasn't torturous. \n\nStarted off with White Sake Sangria ($6.50) which was the best sake infused sangria I have ever had. I've had a few sake sangrias before where the sake overpowered the drink but this one was the perfect blend. Also got a Margarita on the rocks ($4.75).\n\nFor foods:\nCheeseburger Sliders ($6)- I thought were pretty tasteful. Got it as medium which was cooked perfect. One thing that was different was they put cucumbers instead of pickles which I loved because I loath pickles! Good amount for the price.\n\nAvocado Egg Rolls-(half off about $5)- I am a avocado lover so this was heaven in my mouth. It came with a honey cilantro dipping sauce. yum!\n\nShrimp & Chicken Wraps- ($6)- Lots of flavors in your mouth. i really liked it. The portion was just right. The right amount of lettuce and comes with a cucumber salad which was pretty delish.\n\nPhilly Roll (half off about $3)- Sushi wasn't too good. The ratio of rice was pretty off. Not enough fish in it. If you want to eat sushi, I suggest to go somewhere else for it.\n\nService was good. Natalie came by and checked on us at the right times. Food came out in a reasonable time. Our table was a little sticky but other than that I will probably be back again."

The feel of Kona is very commercialized and seemed like it fell into the category of being 'just another chain restaurant.'  \n\nMy BF and I were in the beautiful Boca Park area doing some shopping and was getting hungry for dinner.  Being that we're always trying to find new joints to eat at, I saw this place, looked it up on yelp, saw that there were awesome reviews, and suggested we try it.  From what I remember, it is a rather large restaurant with a lot of seating.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of food they offered.  The layout of the menu really reminded me of like an Elephant Bar or Cheesecake factory.  They had a bunch of random ass dishes that consisted of things such as: pizzas, flatbreads, egg-rolls, pot-stickers, salads, noodles, sushi.  Well, we passed on the dinner menu and leaned towards sushi since thats what I thought this place was.  \n\nTheir sushi menu is a big fat joke.  My BF started off with a $6 seaweed salad that was served on a big ass plate.  I kid you not, the amount of seaweed they put on there was the size of a fucking tablespoon.  I may be exaggerating a bit but I was damn disappointed with the quantity placed before us.  I really felt like they straight took $6 out of my pocket.  Robbed!!! Don't bother with this dish.  We also ordered some salmon sashimi pieces ($9.50), sushi rolls/hand rolls, and one of their chef's plate: a yellowtail jalapeno sashimi with ponzu and cilantro ($11.00).  What a disgrace to Japanese food.  This shit tasted horrible.  I cannot believe the quality of fish they used.  It was cut funny and left a horrible aftertaste.  I didn't bother eating any of the sashimi dishes after the first bite.  I also ordered a side of rice and had to return it twice.  How do you mess up rice??  The first bowl he brought out was hard and dry as hell.  Eww!!  I can't believe they served that, it was not even edible.  You can tell it's been sitting in the cooker for a while.  He brought out another bowl and it was the exact same thing so I passed on it.  To make things worse our server was rude.  He didn't do much and I had to wave him down to keep him updated on the status of our dining experience (ie. rice, drinks, blah).  For the most part he just took our order, brought us our bill, we paid, then bounced. \n\nNever Again."

We told the server that the sushi didn't taste right and I called the restaurant tonight to let them know that he got sick so others wouldn't get sick too. When I spoke with one of the managers there she was dismissive and rude to me. She said there was no way he got sick from the sushi even though our server said the sushi looked strange tonight as well! Because of the manager's rudeness and the food poisoning we will NOT be going here again. I'm surprised by management's combative nature in dealing with customers at this establishment. Not a way to treat your customers that's for sure. If she would have handled it differently and been polite I would not be writing this review right now."

One of them suggested Kona Grill and what a suggestion it was. Although I did get a thorough look through the menu, I didn't have much choice as to what I was going to order as my co-worker kept raving about the Macadamia Crusted Chicken Breast. It was a flavorful delight and so moist and tender no knife was necessary. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were just as good and bursting with flavor. I added a house salad to my meal which was served with an outstanding vinegrette dressing and crumbled bleu cheese. The server was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks were never empty and she kept pretty good tabs on us, making sure that everything was satisfactory. I am definitely going to have to make a return trip to try the sushi. Three of us added salads to our meal which brought the total to just under ninety bucks. That may be a little on the high side for a non-alcoholic lunch, but it was a high class lunch in an elegant setting and worth every penny. It didn't put off a great \"family\" vibe and would not be some place I would expect a family to dine, especially if the kids are younger. Save the money and get the kids a happy meal. This is, however, a perfect place for date night and is located just steps away from Total Wine and More. Bonus! I can see many happy return trips in my future."

Some are half off, some are discounted apps and sushi and drinks ranging from $3ish-7 with most about $6. It was rather busy, but we were able to find a seat and served quickly. \n\nNormally I'm not a roll person and I know that but went with the flow of what is \"recommended\" in reviews. We grabbed one of the specialty rolls - the Voodoo (crawfish mix, avocado, topped w/habanero tuna mix & chili masago) which we got based on the crawfish.It was decent and I like that it's a bit spicy. We also got a crab crunch roll I believe since I happen to like crunchies on things and that was alright. It's good rolls if you like rolls but nothing outstanding about them. \n\nCalamari - this was pretty good. I liked the spicy creamy sauce to go with. I would have liked it a tad crispier, but it was not undercooked or anything. \n\nAvocado rolls - avocado anything I love but the creamy with the crispy egg roll wrapper works for me. This I did like. \n\nService was decent considering the fact it was a busy and full bar area. \n\nI think it was good for happy hour and I would go again since were in Boca Park a lot. I did see flatbreads that looked great and immediately regret not getting one instead of sushi so next time."

We were there on a Sunday, so almost all of their specialty drinks, and many of their appetizers and rolls were half price.  I LOVE half price happy hour!  We had mojitos and pretty much any food item you can think of.  Everything was delicious.  This location is in a small strip mall, but because it was a Sunday, the usual hustle and bustle had died down.  The best part, it's a chain!

When we got our order, I was highly disappointed. It wasn't what I remember ever having. The calamari did not taste fresh, the miso-sake sea bass was tough, and the rice tasted old/stale.

It's not a very high end restaurant like the ones you find on the Strip but it's still a good eat and has a cool, trendy atmosphere. I went with a co-worker we were seated in the main dinning area. You can sit at the bar, near the bar on tall tables with stools or outside on the patio. The lighting was good, not too dark but not bright either. They had some techno/trendy music playing so that was cool. \n\nWe ordered Edamame to start, good and not a lot of salt unlike some restaurants. We ordered some drinks and the bartender made them quickly and they were a little strong (always good haha). We also got the Spicy Aioli (Kona Calamari) which was a little over battered but still tasty to us. I ordered the Pan-Seared Ahi and it was just amazing. If you like sushi or lightly cooked seafood then get this dish! It was sweet because its made with sweet chili sauce; it also comes loaded with white rice (on the bottom) and baby bok choy. My co-worker ordered Miso-Sake Marinated Sea Bass and I thought it tasted great, they did also. Its really rich in buttery flavoring so if you don't really like butter don't order this dish. The Sea Bass just falls apart when you touch it and I actually wished I ordered that after trying it.\n\n The staff was cool and knew their stuff about the menu so that helped a lot. After some drinks the total bill was about $70 before tip. Not too bad for everything that we had and the overall great experience. Check this place out if you are tired or want a change of pace from places like BJ's or Cheesecake Factory (some of my other favorite hangouts)."

It took quite some time for the waiter to take our order, but he was working on at least 10 other tables, so we understood. \nAppetizer-\nThe yellow tail was a little bit more fishy than I like, but the ponzo sauce, cilantro, jalepeno, and crispy rice strips  made for an awesome array of textures!\nMeal-\nI ordered the pork tenderloins with mashed potatoes and bok choy. WOW! Simply the best I've ever had. Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. A job well done.\n\nWe also ordered the Strawberry Basil Lemonade with rum. WOW, DANGEROUS! SOOOOO GOOOOOD!"

The one thing you will always notice is that the outdoor patio is perpetually busy and crowded.  We've dined inside and outside and you definitely want to dine outside when possible.  The vibe is totally different and sometimes depressing when dining inside.  Its a little dark and kind of generic in terms of interior design.\n\nThe food is pretty solid because they the chef knows that tasty dipping sauce is the key to any tapas-style plate.  Their sauces for all their plates are tasty and flavorful.\n\nRecommendations:\nchicken lettuce wrap\nchicken satay\nRed Sangria\nCalamari\n\nWe will frequent this place often because its close to our house and we can kinda pig out without overloading on carbs."

I would also give a thumbs up to the Philadelphia sushi roll. A bit expensive though but it is Boca Park so it's to be expected. The outdoor seating was also wonderful.\n\nNow here is where the 2 stars come from. In all reality I wanted to do 1.5 but it is not an option. The waiter was very disengaged and unhelpful. The girl at the entrance had more personality and made us feel more welcome than the waiter did. The sense I got from him was that he had something better to do or his mind was off somewhere else. We asked about the pork sliders pictured on the menu and his only response was \"they weren't on happy hour.\" Ok, that's nice, but are they available now? When he came back with change for the meal he actually leaned over me to put it on the table. Rude. Plenty of room to just walk up to the table and put it down and say \"thank you\" like any other person would do. I also had to ask him to repeat himself as he was quiet and was leaning on the metal fence near our table which put him a few feet away from our table. Not much tact in my opinion.\n\nI might try eating here again but Vegas has many other options for great food and much better service."

The sushi has gone from good to kind of a mess.  It used to be my favorite thing to order, but now I try to avoid it.  The pizzas, and flat breads are a pretty safe bet.  They've always been well made.  The other appetizers are good too.\nThe flavored cosmos are too sweet for me, and the margaritas aren't as good as they used to be.  There's always beer when all else fails.\n\nSince the happy hour is at the bar, and on the patio only, parking, and finding a table can be difficult.  I usually avoid going there for happy hour when the weather is nice, because that means it will be nearly impossible to get a table."

Ten minutes later a girl comes out and seats in a not very crowded restaurant at all. With about maybe 15 empty tables. We only ordered only three things off the menu. 35 minutes later and there is still no food. I go back up to the front of the restaurant looking for the manager, still no hostess at the front. I wait about maybe 10 more minutes until this lady comes out, I didn't even know she worked there because she was wearing regular clothes. I told her my concern and she gave me an attitude about how she just dropped off the food a second ago. That's still about 40 min for three plates. She doesn't even apologize for the wait and gives me look as I walk away. Only thing that saved this dinner was the miso sea bass. Not worth it though. Will not be coming back."

That's a good design and works well for quite a few places here in town.  \n\nNegative points for Boca Park's parking situation.  Sorry to pass those along to Kona, but I would do so for any of the establishments in that strip.  Nothing like parking at REI and walking across a blazing parking lot to have a beer and appetizers.\n\nSufficed to say, I will likely return to Kona on occasion, as it's a good central meetup location for most people on the West side of town.  Maybe something will surprise me one day and I'll up the marks on my review."

            "review": "This place has been a staple in the landscape of NW Vegas for over 20 years now, and still seems to be going strong. They seem to recognize that their patio vibe and generous happy hour selections, along with the see and be seen drive by location in Boca Park are a winning combo.  Lately, I see all new faces within the staff, and the last couple of visits I've noticed some fairly heavy hip hop music being played in the bar/patio area. I hope this isn't the telltale sign of the demise (or last ditch effort to pull out of a slump) of the bar. The reggae or house music that used to be the regular is what set the tone for a great time (think beach vibe on a beautiful Sunday, and trendy lounge on any summer week night after 9pm). The \"older\" Summerlin singles were even able to tolerate it, and those guys are in there spitting some major game on the regular. Rumor is, the restaurant is closing soon for a remodel to make a second story patio. As long as it isn't constant rap and hip hop playing through the speakers, I look forward to some fresh changes at Kona! Lets hope they dont lose sight of why their patio has been such a hot spot for over two decades."

The group of four i came with decided to sit in the bar so we could get the happy hour. Not really my style. I typically like to sit in the dining room for my dinner. The table was small and we sat by the door where there was foot traffic. Not the restaurants fault, OURS! lol Very nice setting and atmosphere. \n\nWe started with Sangria. The red was better than sparkling for sure. The appetizers we had pot stickers, calamari and the tacos. i would seriously next time consider just coming here for appetizers and drinks. They were SOOOOO good. especially the tacos. I wouldn't change any of them.\n\nFor my main entree, i ordered the Lemon- Garlic Shrimp Pasta. My waiters recommendation. It was phenomenal. Very strong garlic flavor however. I don't mind. Garlic is awesome! My wife got the Macadamia nut chicken. I had a couple bites and i was jealous. Amazing flavor!! Shes very picky and didn't have one complaint. \n\nThe service was also very good. He was very nice and professional. \n\nFor 4 people the total bill was 105.45. We all ate an entree, 3 appetizers (happy hour), 3 sangria's, and 2 iced tea. Not bad at all for a nice evening with the in-laws!"

I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.\n\nSince it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.\n\nThey have a special \"Pairing Menu\" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.\n\nThe food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!\n\nMy friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.

I generally get pretty bad service here, though, and that's where the 2 star rating comes from.  There's always something that happens that makes me say wtf?  One time I had to say excuse me multiple times to a group of servers blocking the entry way between the patio and the inside when I was trying to go to the bathroom.  They were just in their own world, chit chatting and being oblivious.  Another time, our waiter was mostly AWOL from our table and we repeatedly had to flag down other servers to ask where ours was.   It wasn't particularly busy, so no clue what the deal was.  Another time we were seated outside and it was cold... we requested that they turn on the heat lamps but were told it wasn't in their budget to have them on during that time of year.  Another time there was this obviously intoxicated man floating around from table to table in the patio area trying to chat up female customers.  When he went to the bar, the bartender high fived him and served him another shot.  I just feel like they could do a lot more here to improve the customer experience and act like they give a shit.

There were no salt and pepper shakers, except for the waitress to put pepper on with a peppermill, which makes me uncomfortable.  I like to have the option to do it myself, how often I want , without having someone on top of me, doing it.  I ordered a Margherita, and it came in a short thick men's glass, instead of a Margarita glass.  I am a woman, and it was too masculine for me, and ruined my Margherita experience.  My drink was watered down, and tasted like lime-aide.  Also, the music was too loud, and it was hard to have a conversation, and we went home with headaches. It seemed like the music was playing very loud inside, and we were hearing it loud outside.  I wouldn't be anxious to go there again, and will not recommend it to anyone else."

HH is only offered at the bar area, patio or the sushi bar.. and it is one of the few places that offer HH on daily basis~ \nSome must haves for me are the chicken lettuce wraps, calamari & the pizza. We also like to get margaritas on the rocks.. I'm not a fan of the sushi but everything else is delish! \nIf you are not going for happy hour then definitely try the macadamia nut chicken.. mmmm\nThe service is always friendly!

We got there a couple minutes before happy hour. My friend ordered a drink but I opted to wait the couple minutes for happy hour to start. When I told the server this, I felt some attitude. I brushed it off and orders my drink once happy hour started. \n\nWe were there for a couple of hours. The server would only come over to the table when we started to look for her. When she would come over to the table and we would ask for more water she would take over ten minutes to bring it to us. Not to mention the sour look she had on her face the entire time. \n\nI come to Kona often. Most of the time I go it is busy so the service takes longer. The other day when I was there there was a sufficient amount of staff there for all the customers, so I see no excuse for the slow service. I was very disappointed with the service, and felt ignored and unwanted there. I was there to have a good time with a friend I haven't seen for a while and felt like we were constantly worried about how the server would act and the look she has on her face when she came over to the table. I love this place, but at the moment I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."

There was too much batter and not at all oily. Comes with a spicy sauce which was good, but I still prefer the sauce offered at Olive Garden. \n\nBBQ Chicken pizza, I wouldn't get again. Sauce was weird and the chicken was dry. They also cut it very oddly... haha. \n\nPotstickers have good taste but are fried and I prefer mine steamed. \n\nTuna wonton crisps are good. Tuna always seems fresh. Comes with a wasbai sauce that I'm not too fond of, but still good. \n\nOverall - definitely a place to try for happy hour. Not sure if I would go there otherwise."

I wanted the pina colada and our server quickly responded with we don't have a blender and its crap if get the mojito...ok...they have a brisket burger special which my husband ordered only for our server Destiny( really a pleasant girl who really is a good server) to come back and tell us they don't have any brisket...it's a Friday at 650 and you are out of a special...poor planning on the managers part. So we get our sushi and the regular burger which was all fantastic. We aren't even half way through the entree when Destiny asks us if we are having dessert. Can we finish our entrees and see how we feel? We decided against dessert rather quickly and within two minutes of us saying we weren't going to have anything else she had dropped the check. My husband was in the middle of his burger. Nothing worse then feeling super rushed on date night. We paid in cash and she quickly picked up the bill just has my husband finished his burger. We most likely would return for the food cause it is really good but probably stick to the bar area. I love dessert and probably would have had some but feeling rushed put a damper on things so we went to the Cheesecake Factory next door for some nice cheesecake."

A huge helping of mashed potatoes and sprinkle of bak Choy and shoe string potatoes. It was more potatoes than meat still everything on the plate was yummy!

We had to ask for water 2x and the first round of drinks were so weak none of us could tell if there were any spirits used to make them. We asked for each to be remade which took another 15mins and while they were stronger not at all worth the $14 price. Food came out almost 45mins after we ordered and three people had they orders come incorrect. In fact we got a burger that was raw and cold inside. Wrong garnish and not enough condiments. Not once did management come by or even inquire. Our waitress did her best to recover but she was clearly over her head. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Wouldn't be going back."

The food is priced well even when it's not happy hour and the menu does satisfy varying tastes regardless of who you choose to bring along.  Some of my favorites are the avocado egg rolls and sweet and spicy shrimp along with the chicken satay for appetizers.  As far as the rolls go I haven't had one I didn't like, but what I do like is they have a great selection of cooked food for those that don't enjoy sushi.  I like to meet here for lunch or dates when you want some privacy and you can just get a booth to have to yourself."

The staff was on their a game and so polite. My husband ordered some sushi and the miso soup. I ordered the chicken satay and we got our son the chicken tenders with Mac n cheese/french fries. Every single item exceeded our expectations. The chicken satay was so delicious that we almost ordered a second round had we not been so full! My son rarely eats his entire meal but devoured the entire thing. The kids Mac n cheese wasn't just your standard boxed Mac n cheese... It was so great I had to steal a few bites! The waiter was very attentive and helpful with choosing what to order. I highly recommend coming here. My husband and I live across town but will go out of our way to come back. I also recommend trying the jasmine green tea. I don't like ice tea but after trying my husbands I had to order one for myself. Great experience!"

I'm all for sushi, but it's not a food I associate with drinking and partying (probably cuz I get super clumsy with my chopsticks, and then I fail to be able to get anything successfully in my mouth).

The downside there was no fan or misters in this part of the bar.  An oversight that hopefully they will figure out once some one passes out from heat stroke. First day it hit one hundred degrees this year and we were miserable.  We would have moved but there were no tables left to fit our large party. Than there is a middle section upstairs that faces south and closest to Lee's liquor that has an open section in the patio cover.  Those tables had the sun beating down on them.  At least they had some fans and misters. But still looked uncomfortable. If your sitting anywhere near the railing the sun hits you there too. Since the reopening the happy hour menu is more extensive with the food and everything we ordered was good. The drink menu not so desirable. The food came quick but if you ask for extra plates or condiments it takes forever because they have to go downstairs to get it. Our server was hit and miss. Forgot drinks, didn't keep water glasses full (after all we were sitting in the hot corner).  We had lots of plates sitting around after we finished. Forgot to bring drinks. However he was always pleasant. Brought wrong food and forgot to deduct from bill. If there were 1/2 stars I'd give 3 1/2 stars.  I gave 4 stars because of the potential atmosphere if wasn't for the lack of fans and misters and the location is desirable."

I've not been overly interested in their regular menu because I dunno, for ok looking Pacific Rim cuisine it just looks OK to me.  Just seems a tad overpriced.  But I do understand it's Summerlin so the markup needs to be present!\n\nSeems lots of folks like Kona Grill for Happy Hour!  I think it runs M-F from 3 PM to 7 PM, and also most nights from 10 PM to close.  Keep in mind though the weather, Happy Hour is only available at the bar or the outside patio!  If it's too hot or too cold you're in for a not so happy hour.  Also, bar and outside patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis...don't expect a host or hostess to seat you!  Don't wait, find an open table and sit your fat @$$ down!  It can get super busy.\n\nHappy Hour at Kona Grill has a nice menu selection of food and drinks.  It will definitely keep you snackin' and and conversatin'!  Just go with a few friends and you will be kept occupied for a few hours.  Eat and be merry!  Work on your game!  Trust me...some of you 'mackers' need some practice on your form.  Really, \"Come here often?\" is a pickup line?  Oi.  I may not be the best lookin' guy out there but dammit if I'm anything, I'm overconfident (thanks wifey for putting up with me).  Go out there and project you deserve a hot gal on your arm!  Girl with fake boobs and botox lips says \"NO\", just move on!  There's like a dozen of em' at the bar.  Can't score if you don't play the game!  Start shootin'!\n\nAnyway, back to Happy Hour.  There's a lot to try from their menu.  Some of our faves are:\n\n-Sweet & Spicy Shrimp\n-Chicken Satay\n-Kona Calamari\n-Chicken & Shrimp Lettuce Wraps\n-Cheeseburger Sliders\n-BBQ Chicken Flatbread (kinda like a pizza)\n-Crab Crunch Roll\n-Atlantic Roll\n\nOf course on Happy Hour, all this food is 1/2 price!  Stock up and feed your friends!  Most things will average to between $4-$6 each item.  Save some money!\n\nThe drinks are decent prices during Kona Grill's Happy Hour too.  You can get a Sam Adams for $4, margaritas and cosmos for $5 each, wine selection of the day for $5, or a Bud Light draft for $3.50.  There's a few other specials as well.  Not only can you get fed, but get drunk on the cheap as well!\n\nReason why my rating might seem a bit low?  Damn, sometimes the quality of the food at Happy Hour isn't the greatest.  It just ends up tasting OK.  Of course for the price you pay you won't get your taste buds knocked off, but I've been to better Happy Hour shindigs.  Hello...Yard House, anyone??  Sometimes the food at Kona Grill can be hit or miss.  Plus, I knocked off a 1/2 star because who the HELL wants to sit out in the patio area when it's like 105 degrees and you're sweating like a baboon?  The fact that the water misters weren't working properly that day ticked me off as well.  Kinda ruins the experience just a little bit.\n\nService was OK, slow but I can understand somewhat because just about every table in the patio area was full.  And orders were steadily going into the kitchen at a nice rate.  At least our server was nice, and tried their best to keep our water filled since it really was hot outside.  \n\nWill I be back?  Sure, but there are so many other places to get your Happy Hour on at!  Kona Grill won't be the top of my list every time but it is a contender.  I hear right down the way at The Cheesecake Factory they have a Happy Hour of their own as well.  I'm pretty sure so does the Gordon Biersch right next door!  So choices, they are a plenty."

The food is ok, their drinks are typical and the service is either fantastic or terrible.  What keeps me coming back is the patio and the friends I share it with.  The outdoor seating is wonderful.  You get to enjoy fresh air while you sit and chat with your friends; this is a rarity in Vegas.  Due to the hot temperatures, you can be hard pressed to find a place with outdoor setting.  Kona Grill has their patio open year round so you can enjoy something other than a stale indoor environment with recycled air.  I have NEVER eaten inside, it's not what you go to Kona for.\n\nThe food can be hit or miss here.  I have found their appetizers to be more consistent than their dinners.  Servers come and go relatively quickly.  This could be because of the amazing deals they have on food/drinks; the low prices create low tips and people sit and campout at tables for hours.  Servers aren't getting tipped on full price items.  If you have ever worked industry you know this is great for your guests but sucks for your bankroll.   \n\nKona Grill is a place you go to happy hour with your girlfriends, hit up for a mid-afternoon snack and cocktail on the weekend, or take a date you're not too sure about yet.  It's relaxed, well priced and there are plenty people to gawk at.  In Summerlin you have a lot of big players and big tits running around acting like they're still in their 20's.  Fun to watch if sports isn't your thing or your date is boring you.  \n\nAs for the menu... pick something, it will be mediocre like most everything else is on the menu.  The food won't make you sick but it won't knock your socks off either!  If you're into an outside atmosphere more than memorable food and drinks than Kona is for you.  Bring a friend, grab a drink, enjoy their company and the show."

The two of them kept raving about how it's \"sooooo gooood\" and that there is \"nothing bad here at all!\" Naturally, I kept a clear mind and tasted everything they ordered to add to my Yelp review.\n\nWe came on a Tuesday evening around 8:30pm. It was aesthetically pleasing at night time. Dim lights, gentle colors, very nice decor, sophisticated. I'd say it's a pretty nice date place. The front area to the left was the bar which was separated from the normal dining area by glass. The noise level wasn't too distracting and you could just hear the music. But it wasn't obnoxious or anything like that. They played a lot of music that I used to listen in in the early '00s. \n\nWe ordered the Crab Special sushi roll as an appetizer. It wasn't very impressive. Maybe I've just had my fair share of sushi places, or maybe it was a bad night. But it was a so-so roll for me and I probably wouldn't choose to get it again. Then again, it was a simple crab roll, so maybe it's just me. As for entrees, my stepdad ordered a caesar salad with the macadamia nut chicken added in. He had upgraded to an entree size, and I must say that it was pretty big. They added in these cheese cracker like things that added a nice touch to the salad. My mom ordered the Pan-Asian Noodle dish because they had gotten it before and fell in love. It was a warm udon noodle with seasoned beef. I only tasted the noodle and it was really, really full of flavor. The presentation made the dish seem small, but don't let that deceive you! There's quite a bit there to fill you up. I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken entree. It had two large pieces of crispy chicken covered in their shoyu-cream sauce. The combination was delicious! Not too creamy and not too bland. The chicken was also very tender. There was also a side of string beans which were a little too salty for my liking. It was cooked with a lot of butter and garlic. Luckily, there was a side of garlic mashed potatoes to balance the flavor. The pineapple-papaya marmalade was really refreshing as well. If I had to score the dish itself on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 7. The serving size was also very generous, I ended up taking half of it home even after offering my parents some. \n\nAlthough I missed her name, the waitress that served us was very kind. She made sure to check on us often and answered any questions that we had. She also provided more info on other dishes and gave recommendations. So based on her, I'd say the place had pretty good customer service. \n\nSo with two sushi rolls and three entrees, we spent a total of about $70. Not too bad. I wouldn't go all the time, but every once in a while would be nice.\n\nNext time I should try to go with a few friend to check out the happy hour. The people there seemed to be having a lot of fun!"

(She is from Michigan and they have one near her home.)  \n\nWe got there at 6pm.  Easily downed 3 martinis and some apps.   I've never had sushi (GASP!) so this popped by sushi-cherry.  Yum!\n\nWe had a crab surprise, California roll, chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps.\n\nOur waiter, Geoffrey, was fantastic.  He made a Last Call for happy hour drinks.  I have never had that at a bar.  How nice!\n\nWe enjoyed it so much, we came back a couple days later for happy hour.  We sat at the bar and had crab surprise and pot stickers.  SO GOOD!\n\nWe enjoyed the people and the ambiance.  But I think if they didn't have happy hour, this place would be dead.  The restrooms are located back in the restaurant and there was like no one there both nights we went (Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Friday after Thanksgiving).\n\nThis will be my new happy hour place!"

You can get a nice Margarita for $4. They changed a few of the recipes which turned out nice. The new pizzas are pretty decent and are more of a thin crust which I personally prefer. Its best to eat on the patio. Even on a hot day they have nice misters and fans that really keep you cool. The only problem is the outside of the patio has little bushes that attract bee's. So if you're sitting next to gates on the outside of the patio, beware. \nI'm not a huge sushi lover so if I do have a hankering for it, I personally prefer to go somewhere that is known for having really good sushi, this place isn't but the other stuff they do have is pretty legit. Their clam chowder is some of the best i've eaten and almost always partake."

If you like soft shelled crab, then eating a whole one stuffed between two pieces of bread should only increase your love of it. Creme brulee  was the dessert of the day.

Service is fantastic, friendly crowd, great food & did I mention Reverse Happy Hour!\n\nSushi was the craving for the night, so I snapped up the ahi wanton crisp, spicy tuna roll & the crab crunch roll. The ahi was magnificent the horseradish sauce was prominent, not over the top, delectable & delicious, just give me a bag of the wanton crisps which accompanied it & it'll put a smile on my face any day.\n\nSpicy tuna is well spicy tuna, but for some odd reason this edges out possibly the best spicy tuna I've had (sushi para @ chicago), its a remarkably minimal roll, small & explosive in taste (like a grenade of yum!). \n\nClosing out with the crab crunch roll as recommended by the bartender (quite a friendly-chap). Thank you so much for this recommendation, I can finally stop loathing eel sauce! Spot on, great texture, can I have these as mini-snack bites!\n\nIn fairness I'm not one to care for ambiance unless its fine dining, my first yelp 5* can't wait to be handing more of these out!"

Not once did she apologize, it was almost like she avoided our table because she knew she messed up. AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES after ordering, we finally got our first plate, and the entire meal came staggered. Water and drinks were empty the whole meal, never got offered a refill. It was so bad that I actually wanted to walk out and I've never done that. The lady manager kindly apologized (I'm glad someone did) but our experience had already been ruined at that point.

Location aside, I was pretty impressed.\n\nHappy Hour is ONLY available in the bar areas (sushi bar included) and the patio, not in the regular restaurant.  This was unfortunate, because it was HOT on Sunday.  We sat in the bar, which has AC, but its right next to the open patio area, so it doesn't really stay super cool. \n\nService was polite and friendly, from the hostesses, to the waiter who told me about the restriction on the HH seating, to our server.  \n\nFood was ok!  HH has a decent selection of sushi rolls, appetizers, and flatbreads, along with a few drink offerings, some for $6, some for half off.  \n\nI had a Bloody Mary (not on the HH menu, but only $7.50, and a pretty decent size), \n\nFrom the HH menu, I ordered the crab crunch roll: crab mix, motoyaki sauce, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce.  This was half off for HH, so it was basically $3.75 for a really good sized roll.  \n\nI enjoyed this a lot.  I'm not a roll kind of girl...when I do sushi, I do nigiri, and I do AYCE.  Since this wasn't an option here, and the happy hour menu is limited, I picked the one that definitely didn't have avocado (allergy) that sounded good, and I really liked it.  As far as rolls go, I would definitely come back for this roll, and a few of them at that!\n\nPotstickers: seared chicken & vegetable dumplings, asian slaw, traditional soy\ndipping sauce.  These were \"meh.\"  Too much dough, and it was very chewy.  The insides were a little bland.  I'd probably go with a flatbread next time instead.  \n\nThe regular menu is a little pricey for me, especially with how much sushi I usually eat, so I don't know that I'll come here outside of HH, but I will definitely come back to try some more of the HH specials."

Cool place to relax and down some sake. The price isn't cheap and its not too expensive. If your not too hungry - just order from the appetizer menu its very full filling! esp during the happy hour its a lot cheaper too. \n\nI really like the location. Located at Boca Park in Summerlin. So if you live near the area check it out and for anyone who wants to get away from the Las Vegas \"strip\" and the hype then definitely."

Unfortunately its just far enough out of the way that its hard to get back there when you're just visiting on the strip (althoght closer if you're doing Red Rock Casino) but it is so great.  And when I say \"so great\" I'm referring to their Happy Hour.  It may just be my fave of all time."

Of course, it is super crowded at the patio/bar area (the only places where HH is offered), so be prepared to stake out a table for a little while. Once we were seated, our server, Hunter, was awesome! We had a pretty big group, including a few kids, and he was so patient and friendly with us. The food, although a few items took awhile, was really good. The best thing, however, is that the manager continually came to check on us. He said that he'd never seen us before and wanted to make sure we had a great experience- and we did! He so sweetly comped us an extra pepperoni pizza for the kids as well. Wow!  That was really fantastic, and so appreciated. On a beautiful day, Kona Grill is an ideal place to visit!"

Some of the food was borderline tasteless and the drinks were mediocre.  \n\nThe drinks:  The happy hour margarita ($5) sounded like a good idea.  What I received was an overly sour slush lacking any decent amount of tequila.  Although the happy hour Sam Adams draft ($4) was large and tasted like, um, Sam Adams :)  I should have just ordered a couple of those bad boys.  \n\nThe food:  Edible, but I wouldn't return for any of the items we tried.  Now, this is just based on their happy hour offerings; the food from their \"regular\" menu might be decent, I don't know.  We ordered some sushi rolls, chicken satay, and the avocado egg rolls.  The sushi here blows, for lack of a better term.  It was tasteless and sloppy .  We tried to order the \"wave roll,\" but they were out of one of the ingredients.  The chicken satay was alright.  I remember the avocados rolls standing out as the best out of the bunch.   \n\nThe service:  I guess our waiter was kind of busy.  He forget a couple of things like utensils and  was M.I.A. at times.  \n\nThe patio:  This is the place to see and be seen.  You can watch people hot rod by in the parking lot and enjoy a chill vibe near their outdoor bar.  The crowd was diverse, lots of different demographics. \n\nKona Grill is middle of the road in my book.  I may return, but I'm not running back.  All day happy hour on Sundays is a great reason to visit though, even if it's just for the beer and people watching."

Oh, forgot to mention the wine list which had more by-the-glass selections than usual and some really delicious selections too. I went out of the box and tried the Bison Burger which was also juicy and delicious. My Server, Alisha, was great too and always available when I needed her. I didn't have to wait too long to see her cause she was always checking in with me. All in all, this is by far the best experience I have had at a restaurant in a very long time.

We asked to sit inside and the waitress told us we had to go outside for happy hour and wait for a table and didn't offer us any drinks or anything. The manager came and told us to go outside because they don't allow happy hour menu inside and had no exceptions.

I walked in to the restaurant, and was not greeted at all by the hostess, who seemed to be having a conversation with someone sitting next to the host/hostess stand.

I would have appreciated a much more comfortable seating arrangement especially because we had put in a reservation. \n\nStaff- Our waitress was kind and took care of us. She brought us refills before we were finished with our drink. Our waitress was probably one of the only things that I could walk away feeling satisfied with. \n\nThe food- I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne, which turned out to be much spicier that I anticipated. In the description on the menu, the entree consisted of Parmesan, Baby Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, Lemon Cream and Garlic Bread. In my opinion, a little note of the spice should be added Just in case anyone has a problem with spicy food. I toughed out the kick of the spice, however, another person in my party needed to return her entree because she cannot eat anything spicy. It was tasty, just a tad too spicy for my liking. Yes I could have returned my plate to ask for the dish to be less spicy, but i chose not to since it was busy and I was hungry."

Anyways started ordering food and he said oh it's not happy hour yet, (its about 9:35)okay we can see past that so we ordered chicken satay (way over priced for four tiny skewers) and the ahi tuna.... The tuna came out quick it was okay, but by the time the satay came out it was already into happy hour (AND the place was EMPTY)... So my friend started eating it, one bite in... RAW CHICKEN!... The waiter just cut off what we were saying and said \"I'll get it fixed\" no apology, no manager, no nothing... We didn't even want it then but because we didn't see him again until that came out another 30min later and we were hungry so we ate it (and it was totally burned on the outside, but again extremely hungry)... We are in the industry and we understand things happen but WOW... Time to pay we figure he was just being silent about the situation and it wouldn't be on the bill, but it was...

The batter was light but just not very crispy and the dipping sauce was so thick and spicy it totally overpowered the calamari. My California roll was one step up from Costco quality. The rice was overly sticky and the avocado and cucumber were practically non existent. \nThe only 5 star worthy item was the kids meal. Seriously, for like $6.50 it was a ton of food and the options were fantastic. There was everything from shrimp tempura to grilled salmon to  chicken fingers. You also can select two side items and it comes with an orange cut up to look like a bear! So freaking cute. It's served in a bento box and my little guy was over the moon with excitement when he saw it. \nBottom line: would return for the kids meal alone."

Sometimes it does get pretty noisy, but it's a fun place to go to watch a game and hang out with friends.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the happy hour drink menu... Their cosmos make me sick, they're far too sweet, the wine doesn't ever seem like that good of a deal, nor do the saki bombs.  But the food is great!!!"

When Tivoli Village was overrun by a BeerFest last weekend and we decided that Brio was not a good idea after all, my dinner date and I headed across the street and were seated immediately on the patio.   I've never had a problem with the food at Kona and this time was no different, ordering a small house salad and shrimp tempura roll.  However, choosing to sit on the patio was not such a great idea.  The music was too loud for conversation, the misters above our heads were dripping intermittently, and there were people smoking at the next table:  lesson learned.  Other than that, our server was very attentive and we had a great meal.  The End."

All tables on the patio and in the bar area were full so we sat at the bar. The bartender David greeted me right away and gave us very good service throughout. I loved the Red Sangria and the Spicy Tuna Roll. Avocado Egg Rolls were pretty good. Spinach Artichoke dip was just ok, the texture was fine but it really didn't have much flavor, I actually had to add salt which I never do. Brio's is way better. There were several other items on the menu that I would like to try so I'll definitely come back!"

Went during happy hour and ordered their house Cabernet which was actually really nice. \n\nThan I ordered a caprese salad however, after the happy hour ended which was $10. I would've been happy about paying that much if it was worth it. It took about 15 mins to get the salad, really? It's cheese and tomatoes, than they give small portions of the mozzarella and my heirloom tomatoes were kinda hard. My friends didn't get any food. They only came for the happy hour drinks and now I know why. \n\nWaitress was nice, my friends were able to order 2 drinks for me during happy hour because I was unable to make the happy hour time-frame. Once I got to the table to meet up, the waitress brought me my 2 Cabs and charged me the happy hour price."

I just wish the hostess could've greeted us with a nicer attitude instead of a nonchalant one. Other than that I was glad she gave us a booth because coincidentally seated in the booth behind is was my bf's college friend. \n\nOnce seated, our waitress who had her blonde hair braided to the side asked us for our drink orders. She was very nice, attentive, and perky. After getting our drinks our waitress gave us a few min then took our dinner orders. I had the truffle lobster mac n cheese and bf had medium steak. \n\nThe food was amazing! My mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever had. Bf loved his meal, and that's a big compliment because he knows a lot about food. However, the pineapple on his steak was a bit sour. Other than that we really enjoyed our meal. \nA few things I really like about the place is their decor. The contemporary interior made for a comfortable dinning experience.The aquarium was nice. The TVs add a nice touch to the place too. The booths are very comfortable. Kudos to the owners :)\n\nA few other things they could improve on is their service. Our server obviously did not know how to open and serve a bottle of wine correctly. I work as a hostess at a restaurant in the strip and their hostess could use a lecture about good service. Other that those little things the restaurant is a really nice place to eat and hang out. =D"

My better half and her girls have been patronizing this place for years and like it. I finally went since friends insisted hey treat me for helping them move some stuff.\n\nI didn't know they remodeled. So, I am not sure what they looked like before. The place looks hip and trendy. Since I am not single and no one in our party was, no one dressed up.  Not that we dress up for most of these eateries in town. It's LV after all and its always casual. Anything special about the decor? Not to me at least. I can easily sit here or sit at Blue Martini, Cheesecake Factory, or Roy's, and not blink an eye. Do t get me wrong, everything looks new and trendy, if you are into that kind of thing. I just wanted a place to sit.\n\nWe entered and there were a bunch of hostesses(?) standing around. I am not sure what they were. They were stranding by the podium @ the entrance. I assumed we were told there were no seats available. I was related the message from my friends as I mozied in from behind my group. The girls went looking downstairs for a table and I went upstairs with a friend looking for a table. We went, circled around and found a table in the back. As we were about to call, the girls told is het found a table downstairs too. I always thought that was the hostesses job? As much as I love to hear about their social affairs standing in their booth. I can really care less. It doesn't pay the bills, but  I believe we did. Do you really want to go to a place where you are not really made to feel welcome? But they were busy so I am sure they can care less about a party of 4.\n\nWe ordered a crap load of food and drinks and the dinky round bar table could barely contain anything so the server was nice and brought them out as we finished. It would have been more nice if the drinks got refilled as promised. It's so dark outside once he sun goes out. I understand ambiance but you really are just sitting in the dark outside. As the temp cooled, I had to put on my jacket along with everyone else in my group. A gas heater would have provided some light and warmth and served to enhance ha ambiance. It is named after Kona? Do they not ever see Tiki lounges with torches outside? Heck any restaurant outside you go in Hawaii there's something burning at night to give light and ambiance.\n\nSo the food. It was ok. Some avocado roll was the best. The pizza thing was ok. More cheese than tomato sauce but that's a personal preference. The sushi tasted good enough for bar food. Yes, to me this is bar food. You know a place you can get tapas and the like. The burger slider was good. Again, it was good but nothing to write home about either. Maybe if it had more flavor it would but overall it was kind of bland. A Five Guys burger has more taste. So overall the food was average. Presentation was great but the taste is just alright. This is where having a great experience would compensate for the food a bit. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad here. It just could have a little more flavor. The best was the avocado thing out of the five items we ordered. We had a thing with a tortilla chip on the bottom and something on top. I am thinking it was some kind of fish. But, that's how memorable the food was to me.\n\nThe server seemed to be trying to get the knack of things but was friendly and cheerful. The bussers worked their butt off. And the hostesses held the podium up.\n\nOh the scene. I noticed there were quite a few single people sitting and eating by themselves. Kona grills reputation previously as told to me was that it was running with cougars with money and cops. That's probably why I never cared to come. From what I could see as I was walking around to search for a table to sit, there's quite a few available ladies out here ready to mingle.\n\nWill I come back? Yeah maybe in the next 10 years. I am not particularly fond of having to look for my own table when there's people paid to do just that. I will just stick to Downtown Summerlin for local eats. It's within walking distance for me anyway. No need to drive that far to get lousy service. So, unfortunately, as nice as the hard working bussers and waitresses are, those ditzes ( I apologize to ditzes everywhere else) ruin it for the whole staff. I am pretty sure they view customers with biased glasses. But ladies, if you were working at my office, you would've been addressed to shape up or shipped out a long time ago. Then again, maybe Kona Grill pays these professional podium models to keep the place from falling down and pick and choose who they want to feel welcomed at their establishment."

Service was fine, no complaints, no problems, everything on the order correct. \n\nI was buffeted out and wanted some good food.  My cheeseburger was perfect.  A large thick patty on a toasted bun with fully melted cheddar cheese.  They didn't put lettuce on the burger, which is just fine with me.  I rated this the best burger I ate this year.  My date had shrimp penne pasta which was plentiful and tasty. Pasta al dente, not mush.  The other diner had the pork steak and it was perfectly done. Very thick and flavorful cut of pork steak.\n\nI'm surprised by the negative reviews here.  This is Kona Grill, with a laid back Hawaiian ambience.  This is now my favorite Las Vegas eatery.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Hawaiian influenced food style without the leis and hula skirts.\n\nWhy didn't I give it 5 stars?  I reserve those stars for a truly exceptional experience.

So they don't even do the bar scene well. I ordered the macadamia nut encrusted roasted pork tenderloin in a mushroom sauce... what I received was probably days old, pan seared DRIED out pork something... no macadamia nuts... no mushroom sauce, 4 tiny slices of shriveled mushroom on the plate covered with fried onions and a mountain of potatoes with completely limp bok choy. Terrible meal. The only reason I gave the place 1 star is the waitress was very sweet, very apologetic about the drink, and I didn't have it in me to tell her just how awful the meal was after she was so nice."

Yes, as with most Las Vegas patios, it overlooks a parking lot, but there is a bit of greenery to shield your eyes. Plus, there is generally some nice auto eye candy in the parking lot. \n\nMy first Kona experience was at lunchtime with the parents. Beware of the iced tea. We were all on a flavored tea kick after sipping on some fruity treats at Create and Sammy's, so we swiftly ordered up some of the enticing flavors at Kona. Little did we know that their flavors were delivered in a four-dollar Republic of Tea bottle! We searched the menu and found no indication that this was the deal, or rather un-deal.  $4 and no refills? I suggest sticking to the regular brewed tea. \n\nWe all went with the perfect pairings lunch offerings. You pick two from a nice list of options for $8 and change. I chose a salad and the turkey chili. My husband went with some sushi. The salad was okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the over miso'd dressing. I love miso, but it was really overpowering. The turkey chili, however, was yummy. My only complaint is that I wanted more! The sushi looked a little sad. The imitation crab was leaking pink onto the plate. Never a good sign, but my husband seemed happy enough.\n\nI wouldn't say Kona was a knockout experience for us, but there is that patio bump in effect, and the happy hour specials definitely demand a repeat visit."

When we arrived they were still setting up our table. The very courteous hostess then informed us that there was room available for our party on the patio. I then remembered about the all day happy hour and we accepted the offer to sit outside. The weather was perfect that day which provided a great atmosphere for our meal.\n\nHappy hour gave us the chance to order and sample many items. For drinks, I had a bottle of cold sake for $6.75 and my wife had the sparkling sangria for $6.50. For food, they have select items for $6 and other rolls and flatbreads for half off. We ordered pretty much the entire HH menu except for a flatbread. Everything was quite tasty and no plate was left with food on it. The shrimp tacos were a hit and I enjoyed the Voodoo Roll which has spicy crawfish, tuna, and habanero sauce.\n\nMychael was our server and he did a fine job despite being very busy with multiple tables aside from our 10 top. One thing to be aware of is that the bar and patio areas are first come first serve so there will be vultures hovering around, especially when you are coming close to finishing because they want your table. Happy hour at Kona Grill is a good value and we'll definitely be back."

The service has always been excellent, and the food? Deee-lish. The edamame is covered in coarse sea salt, just enough to notice the flavor and add a pleasant crunch. We all shared the 18-piece shashimi assortment and a gorgeous 8-piece Rainbow Roll, all authentically prepared and absolutely delectable. Their website omits the prices of their dishes, but they're pretty comparable to any other fine restaurant.They do serve a few standard American dishes, such as breaded pork tenderloin and meatloaf. I haven't tried them, but considering the sushi is mighty fine, I'd be willing to bet their other fare is pretty darn good, too."

He asked us how many then told us he would go look for a table for us? Came back and said we had to sit outside or at the sushi bar. We decided outside even though it was cold. We were directed outside and had to find our own seat after about ten minutes someone finally came up to us and asked to take our drinks then cut us off and asked if we were 21. We aren't so she told us we couldn't sit there and she would show us to the sushi bar the only place we could sit? Then we were walked over there where all the spots were full of dirty dishes and unpicked up tips so we just left. Terrible service and they were offensive. They treated us like we were 12 which we are 18 and look and act much older. Give me the same respect as everyone else."

Kona has been known to us as being a great place to go for happy hour, It's been pleasurable, great food and insanely great prices.. So, we haven't been there since they remodeled.  Gorgeous interiors!! Still trusting it was the same Kona as always we ordered our usual appetizers and drinks for happy hour.  Moscow mules were our drink of choice for the entire table.. 17 drinks total, and three dishes.  4 people.  We asked for the bill and were shocked by a couple of things.. First, there was no buzz at all.  Those Moscow mules didn't hit any of us.  ????? Very curious.. But hey ok, we had a great conversation and it's a beautiful atmosphere.  Still, where was our buzz? 2nd.. The bill $180!! Each of our happy hour drinks were $8.00!!!!! What????? and literally no buzz for anyone.  This was shocking to each of us.  So, in one fell swoop our great appreciation for Kona Grill fell, and we all felt- we can't return here because the cost $$$$$$ there was literally no liquor in our mules at all.. Just not worth it.  Bye Kona."

The patio is first come first serve seating which was nice for us because we could pick wherever we wanted to sit. However, that meant that the wait staff were terribly overburdened and not as attentive as I think they may be in the indoor seating. The waiter was amazing and as helpful as he could be with the number of other tables that he had to serve. We ordered the dragon roll on happy hour special and it was one of the better dragon rolls I've had in Vegas so far. But not one of the best ever. \nAdditionally, we ordered the burger on special - Mauna Kea Burger - and it was phenomenally cooked. We devoured it in an instant. It comes with crispy thin fries which were very well seasoned but the portion of the fries was a little small. \nI would absolutely recommend Kona Grill. It's close to us so I think this will definitely be one of our happy hour spots on a weeknight when it's cool in the Fall."

I could kick myself for never trying it until now!

When we arrived we were greeted kindly by the hostess that informed us that happy hour is seat yourself so we picked our own table! Once we found the table we wanted we were almost immediately greeted by our friendly waitress! She made some suggestions since I was new which was a plus! I am a margarita on the rocks kind of guy and she suggested after I do that one to do one of the flavored ones! It was just as good!

Maybe because of all the hype.\n\nThe food was pretty good (I had the chopped salad with macadamia nut crusted chicken), but not great.  We also ordered a sushi roll to share as an appetizer, and that was good.  The three others in my party all said their entrees were \"good,\" too... but no one was raving about any of it.  Our desserts were GIANT and tasted good.\n\nThe really bad part of our experience, was definitely our flaky waiter.  As I said, we ordered our sushi as an appetizer... and he even asked if we wanted it before our entrees and we said yes... but after waiting a long time (probably about 20 minutes), our roll came at the same time as our entrees.\n\nThen after we ate our entrees, we sat and sat and sat and sat, waiting for the dessert menu.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waiter at all (not even at tables around us), we finally asked a busser if he could find our waiter.  We watched the busser look for him all around the kitchen and the dining room.  I'm not sure where our waiter was hiding, but it took another five minutes just to find him.  When he finally did show up, he gave us our bill without even bringing the dessert menu.\n\nHe took the bill back and finally brought us a dessert menu, and we asked him what he recommended.  He said \"let's be honest... I'm gonna tell you everything on the menu is good.\"  Umm... ok.\n\nSo I don't really want to judge the restaurant on this really bad waiter... because I am sure not EVERY waiter there is that awful... but with so many other great places to eat in town, we definitely won't be going back any time soon."

Even the managers yesterday introduced themselves to ask what we thought of the new store (which opened last Saturday).\n\nWe had a sushi roll that even my \"No sushi\" partner loved.  Then the chicken lettuce wraps that came with 7 pieces of luscious butter lettuce & they were sooo good!  My partner, rather an expert on hamburger sliders, said these were the best because the two were large enough for his lumberjack appetite,  the cheese was generous & the \"right\" bun topped off the taste.  These sliders also come with a large portion of fries.\n\nThe prices have been only slightly raised on food & drink, & don't forget the terrific cocktails on happy hour; also, $2 off all wines.\n\nYes, and yes again.... we'll be returning, espec. in light of the Summerlin store closing soon for 3 months for a complete remodel (incl. an upstairs with patio) which promises to resemble this lovely Strip property."

So after I clocked out, came in, and got a bar table for 1. Right away from walking in, the hostesses were friendly, my server introduced herself after I was sat, and I got my HOT SAKE!! Everything came out splendiferously and my experience during my early dinner was amazing. Great food, awesome staff, delicious HOT SAKE, and FIRE OUTSIDE to stare at...just awesome.

We sat down, talked about it, and almost left.\n\nThankfully, the server made up for it entirely. He was very welcoming, very engaging, and even had   conversation with our young kids. He made great suggestions on drinks and food. \n\nThe food was excellent. The calamari appetizer was very good, the Seabass was amazing, and the sushi was very creative and unique.  Between our server, and the quality of food, this is one of the best places to eat in Vegas, and we have been just about everywhere.  They need to breathe some life into the greeter though."

The restaurant is on street level on Las Vegas Blvd, just north of the big screens/elevator bank. \nIt was nice to sit outside in January in the sun and soak up the 60 degree warmth while back home temps were sub-zero. That alone added one star. I love sushi and have had it all over the world. I liked that Kona Grill had some interesting combinations of rolls. I had two rolls, one that was new to me and one I order almost everywhere I go. They were both good, but I was not blown away. The service was perfect. Kept my water filled and was very attentive without being too aggressive. I would like to try other places in Vegas for sushi next time as there are loads of options and if this is the best, the city is in bad shape."

We arrived around 5:45pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant was quite empty. The restaurant is large and beautiful, with tasteful lighting and decorations and very spacious dining areas. There is also an outdoor patio and a sushi bar seating area.\n\nService was great. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive throughout the entire meal. We were excited about the happy hour specials, as the listed sushi rolls and appetizers were about 40% off (traditional rolls were $4.50 and special rolls were $10 with happy hour prices), but unfortunately we found out that the happy hour was not available on weekends (apparently it is between 3-6pm on weekdays only). Without the happy hour, I thought the prices were quite high for the sushi ($8-9 for a traditional roll and ~$15 for a special roll). They also have an entree menu with entrees listed for around $15 to $25. \n\nI tried the following:\nBeef brisket burger (seasonal special, $15) with bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato, and fries: quite good, but not particularly special compared to other burgers that I've tried. The brisket flavor was not very prominent, although the burger was cooked well and the fries were crispy and well-fried. \nAlaskan roll (baked salmon, spicy aioli, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce, $8): a pretty average roll. I probably should have calibrated my expectations since Las Vegas is landlocked and the fish has to be flown in, so it isn't as fresh as the sushi I'm used to in Boston. Overall it was okay but not amazing. The tempura flakes added a nice texture and crunch to each bite. \n\nOverall food was 3/5. Sushi dishes were average but my friend at our table got the basil pesto linguine ($19) and said it was the best pasta dish he had ever had, so maybe the non-seafood entrees are better."

It was a Thursday @6pm. \n\nFacility:  This is a nice spot. It's super modern and trendy. There is some beautiful decor. They have tables and chairs, bar seating, outside seating, and booths. Love the wine tunnel and the blue lights. You could dress up nice on date night or come casual in blue jeans. \n\nService: 5 star service!!  My waitress was Kiyanna, and she was awesome!  She was friendly, knowledgable, honest and just plain nice. She was very attentive asking back at just the right times during our meal. I will be asking for her specifically the next time I come in. \n\nFood: We took advantage of the happy hour choices, and didn't regret it.  For a very reasonable price, you get actual plates of food...not the little 2 bite tapas at most places. We ordered the following...\nAvocado eggrolls - these were pretty tasty, but the cilantro sauce for dipping was too sweet for me. \nChicken Satay 2.5/5 - chicken was good, but not a fan of the sweet hoisin sauce.  The peanut sauce was just ok. But I'm. It a good judge because I don't care for peanut sauce. \nBulgogi Tacos 3/5 - loved the crispy chewy taco shell. Unfortunately, they put the sweet hoisin sauce on the tacos, so I couldn't finish them. Just way too sweet. However, my friend liked them so much, she ordered some Togo. \nCheeseburger sliders 4/5 - these were good, and pretty big for sliders. The fries were hot and good!\n\nOverall: I like this place. Although the sweet side of the menu is not my fav, the savory dishes make up for it. And the service from people like Kiyanna take it over the top!!!!!"

I usually go to the summerlin location but as we all know it is temporary closed.. They are both great locations with excellent service. BEWARE of the margaritas at Kona Grill! They are very strong and addicting! My friends and I always stop by here before the club to pre game. Great atmosphere! Love it."

Not even kidding, we came back the very next day. Awesome decor and atmosphere, nice open-air bar with outside patio seating. AMAZING happy hour! As I said I'm from the Bay Area so I'm used to tiny bite-sized portions for the money you pay, you get so much here! BBQ flatbread was basically a full-sized pizza for $7! Love the fusion of cuisine, with plenty of sushi and non-sushi items. I manage at a high-end Japanese restaurant and I have to say the sushi was great and reasonably priced. Everything we ate was delicious. Manny was a great bartender, very friendly and even gave us \"tourist advice\" as far as cool stuff to do and check out. This will be a mandatory stop whenever I go to Vegas.\nMy only drawback is that the 2nd day we went there (which was a Saturday) they don't offer happy hour but the menus are still on the table and bar top. We had a different server that day and he didn't let us know until we got our check and I asked him about it. Not a huge deal, but he saw us order off the happy hour menu and didn't tell us that we would be paying full price. Simple solution - take the happy hour menus away if it's not happy hour!\nOther than that, definitely recommend. 5 stars"

            "review": "This is the most family-friendly restaurant we've encountered in quite some time.  That alone deserves 4 stars.  Only people who have raised young children will be able to understand how commendable that is.  \n\nWhen we were looking for places to eat near the Strip, we specifically pick based on how appropriate it would be for kids to be there(since we have two young ones), and whether or not the food offered would fit their picky palettes. On Yelp, Kona Grill is not listed as being \"Good for Kids.\" However, we saw on their website that they have a kids menu, and the options seemed pretty tasty and diverse. So we ignored Yelp's designation and made a reservation. First, the tables are very spacious. In a rectangular table for a party of six, we had adequate space to seat three chairs plus a high chair on one side of the table. Had we needed, we would also have been able to utilize the space on the ends of the tables, as there were no other tables closely aligned next to it. Second, the sensitivity to kids that Kona Grill exhibits is a plus. They do not just plump a kids menu down onto the table. They bring drawing pads out for them to play. They also know to bring out the kids food first. Third, and this is the most impressively--they have a family restroom(separate from the usual men/women's rooms). With a changing station. That appears made of stainless steel. Only parents who have raised young children will understand what a game changer that is. For Kona Grill to put this kind of effort into welcoming children, when most of their customers are probably not children(at least not at the time that we frequented), speaks volumes about the type of chain they aim to be. My wife and I were blown away. Oh, and the food was great too. A diverse select was offered, from Chinese-type cuisine on the main menu to pizza(for the kids). They were all executed to great quality. The ambiance is very hip as well, and ought to be attractive to young adults and the like.\n\nIt is rare to encounter a restaurant with such a hip feel that puts so much effort into reeling in families as well.  Kona Grill executes this perfectly on both ends of the spectrum.  This is my new favorite chain."

I arrived around 8pm and sat at my table for a long time before anyone ever approached me. The waitress apologized and was super nice. I guess she had been training someone and had been tied up. I ordered the coconut shrimp roll and the tempura sea bass roll. The tempura sea bas roll was really good but the rolls here fall apart very easy and they are wrapped with a yellow wrapper instead of of your green seaweed wrapper I am used to seeing. When it comes to paying full price for sushi I think there are other choices in Vegas. However if you hit the happy hour its worth it. I do enjoy sitting on the outdoor patio people watching."

This was nearby, and since I'd been to another location of theirs in a mall in Dallas I figured it was probably basically the same thing. It was. We were there around lunch time so we didn't partake in the happy hour specials. We each got a salad. The portions were large, just as I remembered. The caesar dressing is light and legitimate. The addition of salmon for $6 is totally worth it as the portion appeared to be more than 4oz. My draft beer was $6.50, which is a bit steep but I guess finding drinks inside the mall may be a challenge so an up charge may be warranted here. Our waiter was pretty quick and friendly. The place was almost entirely empty, but sometimes service is worse under those circumstances. Clean silverware and cloth napkins for the win!"

First let me say our server was friendly and attentive; however, there were a few mistakes which kind of spoiled the meal for me. I ordered the following: tuna sashimi, a caterpillar roll, and the kona fillet. Fist mistake was that when my tuna came out it wasn't sashimi it was nigiri. Told the server and he fixed it right away. Waited a while and the caterpillar roll never came out, was like fine not a big deal. Here's where I started to get a bit sour I ordered the kona fillet med-rare and it came out med-well. I told the server and he apologized right away.  When the check came out our server said \"I took care of the tuna for you\". I wasn't expecting that at all, I was pleased. We get our check and what he meant was that he took care of the tuna nigiri that came to our table by accident. I figured that would be automatic given I didn't order that dish. So why I'm a little sour is a combination of getting a over-cooked steak on top of thinking the server made it right for us at the end when what he really meant was, he took care of the mistake he made."

After that first bite, had them redo it.\n-Very small portions.\n-High prices."

We also had a soup - tomato basil bisque.\n\nTo our surprise the food significantly exceeded our expectations. We thought we would just grab some food quickly before our other scheduled activities that night, but I think it's fair to say that both of us actually enjoyed the food.\n\nAll dishes were very balanced with ranges of ingredients from fresh vegetables to flavorful chicken meat. It was quite filling. I ordered a salad and thought I was going to still be hungry after eating, but it turned out that the portion was big enough to get full.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. When we arrived we were greeted and thanked for coming by somebody who might be a manager there.\n\nWe sat outside which is a nice experience tool since its in the middle of strip.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you looking for a decent place to have a quick (or not) meal, you should consider this place."

This place definitely did not disappoint!\n\nWalked in a bit after 7pm and there was no wait. Our server (I believe his name was Jason), was superb. Very courteous and recommended the yamada roll (which we got free for checking in!). \n\nOther dishes we ordered: \n1) NY Strip: medium-well was a bit more well done than medium, but not bad. Came with mashed potatoes, grilled Brussels sprouts, and bacon bits. All very good!\n2) Lobster Mac N Cheese: my FAVORITE! Super cheesy and they do NOT skimp on the lobster. Extra cheese baked on top was an added bonus. \n3) Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne: average. Good but nothing overly impressive. Decent choice for my mom who can't have too much spice/fat/etc. \n4) Avocado Chicken Club sandwich: not quite my cup of tea but my sister loved it. Comes with snackable taro chips. \n\nOverall this place is pricier than we would normally go for, but we can't really complain. Food was delicious, service was excellent, and location is convenient!"

We waited a few mins no biggie and the server came to take our order because she noticed we were finish looking through the menu. We placed our order and food came promptly. The calamari batter tasted stale. Like it was pre made and they just heated it up. We also got the spinach dip and the chips also tasted stale. The sushi rolls were good. We ordered the dragon, rainbow and philly. I didn't really like the philly because it was smoked salmon my bad I should've read that. After the food was delivered the waitress checked on us and my husband wanted another beer. She was preoccupied chit chatting with her coworkers at the micros computer next to the bar she forgot the beer she seemed as tho she was in a daze. We finished eating waited another 10 minutes or so by that time there was no point in even getting another beer so my husband asked for the check. She walked right past us to go clean up a table mind you it wasn't even busy. She disappeared for another 10 mins before finally delivering the check. I really didn't want to tip her but we still managed  to give her 12% tip. We are normally 20% tippers but this was just a bad experience for us this time. The other two times we dined here it was completely dead and we had better service. I like this location better than summerlin because it has more air conditioned tables. I just hope the servers get it together here."

First of all there was one table seated in the entire place even though they had two more hours till close. No one acknowledged us even though the waitress and bartender both saw us and didn't even bother asking if we needed help until we finally just asked if we could sit where ever. The waitress then gave us menus and disappeared for 30 minutes so the bartender ended up serving us instead. I ended up getting the sushi platter which was disappointing and my husband got a bacon burger which was pretty good but not worth the price and pretty basic for how the restaurant looked and was priced. The restaurant it self is very nice and has some cool flashy modern decor but when I received my food and saw the prices for everything I'd definitely say the place is over all more pretentious than anything else. The meal was easily forgettable. Everything was actually, with the exception of the cool fish tank at the entrance but next time I think I'll just look at that from the street and skip the mediocre food and bad service."

I personally believe that gratuity is optional and a staff shouldn't tell their guests to give this certain percent next time they eat at the restaurant. I just invited my friends to eat since I just received a $200 gift card from my friend which I used to pay. We were a party of four and it wasn't really busy at all. We were just college students and don't really have a lot of money but you guys make it seem like only the upper class people should eat at your restaurant which I think is wrong. The servers gets paid to do their jobs so then tips are not supposed to be mandatory. Gratuity, by definition, is a voluntary tip for services paid by the patron to the restaurant for services rendered; therefore, the patron should not be told to pay such a charge."

With the holidays around the corner I know I'll have a couple more pit spots at this location now. \n\nI came in on a Sunday afternoon it's football season so you know we had to find a spot playing the games. Our servers name was John. My brother had never been here so he was very helpful and detailed about what were the house favorites. We got a couple rolls from their sushi bar. One was the piranha and the other was the shrimp and lobster roll. I could be wrong the piranha roll. We were so hungry I didn't even snap a couple photos like usual. The food was so great that well I couldn't resist. With a yelp check in we got a free appetizer and we got the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps!!! My personal favorite and my brother also enjoyed it very much! Hands down the best lettuce wraps around. We got an order of Pad Thai that the house split in two for us before we even asked. The service and the food quality and taste couldn't outdo one another. Thank you John for your service and making our Sunday pit stop after a day of shopping great.

He suggested the Tuna Tataki roll which was much better than I expected for some random restaurant I walked in to grab a drink along my trip down the strip. It's likely their best roll, hands down! Thanks, Jason! He's personable, and honest and valid recommendations. \n\nWe were so into the Tuna Tataki that we had the Yamada Roll...which was just okay--not sure if I'd get it again, but if you like \"sweet and sour\" type things it is fine. Also *disclaimer* softened the blow to get it gratis from the Yelp check-in deal. Happy hour sake bomb is totally worth it BTW. \n\nSo not anywhere near Hawaiian food or the best sushi spot I've been to but I was genuinely and pleasantly suprised by 1) Jason and 2) the Tuna Tataki. Want a no-frills Vegas dinner with screens to boot? This is your spot. \n\nAlso got the Kona Calamari. Too much for 2 in my opinion but I like it with the special Japanese sauce."

The food was great and our server John went above and beyond! I'd recommend this place to everyone! Turned my whole trip around!"

The sushi rolls I had were tasty and you can't go wrong with any of them. I do wish that I had more room to try them all, Haha."

After a grueling experience at RA Sushi Bar next door my girlfriends and I decided to go get some better drinks here! Kona Grill is known for some great cocktails! I was excited to try this location out because I am such a fan of the one located in Boca Park! When we walked up we were warmly greeted by the hostess and told that we could sit wherever we wanted! As soon as we sat we were then greeted by a couple server's actually! Told them we were just interested in some drinks and no food! No problem at all! I wish I could've remembered both server's name because they were both great! After about 3 rounds of drinks we were tapped out and ready for our check! I can't wait to return for some food one of these days especially if the service is as on point as it was just this weekend!"

The fish was Pre-cooked and re-warmed. Same for the fried rice which was so dry as to be tasteless. The salsa is equally bad. Didn't look or taste fresh. I keep hearing Vegas has an amazing food scene. Ah, where is it?"

Jason made sure the order was perfect, and that we were totally happy!! \n\nWe will definitely will be coming back because of Jason M!\n\nSide note, we were here the night prior to which my fianc\u00e9 left her credit card. They kept it for us and made sure it was my fianc\u00e9 by checking her ID before handing it over! Great all around service!\n\nThe hostess was also super friendly and it was nice to be greeted by such a nice person after a long day of working with pricks!"
