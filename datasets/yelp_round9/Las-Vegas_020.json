The shtick is that the wait staff is rude/obnoxious, and it can be pretty funny.\n\nThe food wasn't as fun.\n\nI had the pulled chicken sandwich which was OK, but nothing great.\n\nHowever, my wife had the \"Cheesy Mofo Burger\" and was the worst burger that either of us had ever had. It didn't taste like beef--it was more like a Boca Burger. Just awful. It's crazy to think you can go wrong with that much cheese.\n\nWe both had a couple tall beers and our lunch tab was $60, which was $50 more than this meal was worth."

They rarely came to our table and when they did they just asked were we done with our entree. We felt like they rushed us out. They were very attentive to the table of people next to us tho. Right before we left they asked us if we wanted a hat. We were here 30 minutes tops and spend $110 on the crappy cold food. Suggested tip amount was $20 but I left 10 due to the service or lack of service."

The bartender who was serving turned out to also be an amazing magician and comedian -- Totally made my day! \nNot only that, but he saved us a few bucks by selling us the football instead of the boot. Apparently it actually holds more liquid than the boot. Meh, I trusted the guy and thought he was great. Also, I'd definitely suggest either getting the Long Island Iced Tea beverage or go ahead and throw in the extra $3 for an extra shot ... Definitely will be worth it!"

I'm saying this because I was sober and still had fun with the atmosphere and even enjoyed my food. Everyone said it sucked but it was quite delicious(had the big burger). \n\nOur server was slow but busy. The main thing when she came to our table she kept us entertained because she knew we were waiting (part of the dining experience). The other servers were funny as hell too and they gave us hats and made fun of us. I'm cool with that humor some people aren't. I wouldn't bring kids here, but everyone else can have a great time especially if you play ball with your server-it will make it more fun and a better time overall."

About the only funny thing Our server did was steal peoples ca,era and wonder around the restaurant getting strangers to flip the camera off. Everything else was lame. I had to ask 5 times for a refill. Even thou I told him in the beginning I drink fast and would like him to bring me more then 1. The chairs were this rickety park bench that you had to put the smallest person in the middle because it bowed to much in the center. One Guy had to straddle the leg of the table in order to not fall off. I wont be back to this Dicks. I would however highly recommend the one in Myrtle Beach."

The food is the standard hamburgar and chicken strips; nothing to fancy. \n\nThe waiters are all dicks (hints the name), but that made for a great laugh.

Anyhow, my husband and I stay at Excalibur often (mainly because our room is always free and we like free) and we usually hang out at Dick's once during the trip. Dick's is not for the sensitive or easily offended. The staff are dicks! That is the gist of this place. It's quite comical and it's fun to be a dick right back to them. In a nice way of course! I always end up laughing my ass of when I am here. The people watching alone is great. They even have sing alongs and do other goofy things. The last time I was there, they had Grease playing on all of the TV's and were making remarks on different scenes. I never realized how perverted that movie really was (like Frenchy with a banana)! The last time we were there, we made new friends, laughed our asses off and before we knew it, 3 hours had gone by! \n\nOf course there is more to the place than just fun and goofiness. The food is decent and drinks aren't ridiculously priced compared to most Vegas prices. The food is definitely not gourmet but it's pretty decent. Dick's is a nice break from the pretentious. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place is when people walk up to the bar and the bartender acts like a dick and the people get pissed because they don't get it. I've seen some pretty entertaining arguments!"

It's 1am and our last night in Vegas, we walked back to our hotel after many, many drinks. We're walking by they had the restaurant lights down and the multi-colored lights on with music playing!\n\nWe decided to walk in and see what was going on. A nightclub. We walked into a night club. I hadn't been to a Vegas nightclub in a years, and I was iffy about staying, but we did. I think I was mostly sold on the drinks. They were big and less expensive than the casino bars. \n\nThe dance floor was small and cramped, they had left a table or two out, so we had a place to sit next to the dance floor, but having people bump into your chair wasn't fun. The sound system wasn't great and the DJ needed some work on his music selection and song transfer. \n\nWe stayed long enough to finish our drinks and went to the blackjack table instead. \nI won't come back for their idea of a \"club\", but I still want to try their food."

A good base for a night of drinking. \nWhile Taco the bartender was funny as shit, he did serve me a shot that I thought was \"on the house\" after he made a rather large batch of mix drinks for other customers. Turns out he charged me $10 for the swill. I didn't bring it up to our waitress, but just took it as a lesson not to assume anything is free and I'll pass it along to other Yelpers."

I went recently for my 21st birthday and all I could think was \"I never want to leave this place! \" what you pay for and come for is the atmosphere. If waitresses shoving your face in their tits and men performing a water spectacular isn't you're kind of entertainment then this might not be the place for you. Great service isn't exactly their motto however it does remind me of being at your buds house and just \"dickin'\" around. Not meant to be your slave and hand you napkins and a menu. In Dick's words you get it and do it your damn self. The food is tasty. I had a \"Big Ass Burger.\" There's not much variety (although what is there is delicious ) on the menu but you really do eat there for the experience. Most fun I've ever had an will make it  a regular stop in my future Vegas trips."

Much more extensive menu in Vegas than in San Diego.  They serve the chicken pasta that I used to love, that they no longer serve in SD.  Bonus points for that alone.  I also loved my Sweet Potato Fries.  My husband had the Steak and Eggs (at 4pm, oh yeah!), and he said the eggs were egg-cellent (hardy-har-har!) and the steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare).\n\nPrices were pretty reasonable (for Vegas), and laughs were plentiful.  We had a great time here.  You have to be prepared for the crude-ness and the Dick's schtick.  I'm well versed in it, so it's all good by me."

With our mlife credit we decided to use it at the restaurant . I would suggest coming here semi drunk so that you can really enjoy it. Our waiter was great but the other waiters looked like they were engaging with their customers a lot better and that they were having a lot more fun. If it's your birthday let the waiter know so that you can get a free but horrible lap dance by the bartender who's wearing a thong. Lol The food was surprisingly very good! My boyfriend had the steak and I had the shrimp platter ! Both very good ! The drink I got was very very very sweet. Fun spot !"

I liked the nachos. Dinner choices were chicken with rice, brisket, fried shrimp, shrimp cocktail, or chicken strips. Shockingly the brisket was tender, juicy, and flavorful. I didn't order this assuming it would suck. My fried shrimpies were quite amazing but the chicken looked dry and unappetizing. \n\nGranted, you don't come here for the food, but rather for the experience. My friend's lap dance by taco was one of the highlights along with the balloons they tied to her hair. It was a scene from a Pixar movie....my fave part of the night. \n\nGood times, good service, but our waitress royally screwed up on the bill and charged us extra gratuity on top of our bill which turns out to have already included the 15% gratuity and birthday booking charge. Kinda messed up. We had no clue at the time but thought the bill was unusually high and couldn't make sense at the time. It was only after we had left that we realized this waitress had basically charged us 30% tip at the end of the day. \n\nI'd inly go back for a special occasion."

We showed our waiter our coupon and all four of us ordered a drink. He shows up with two drinks per person, 8 in total. I asked \"why did you get us all two drinks each?\" to which he replied, \"that's what 2 for 1 means dumbass\" and walked away. Okay. Let me start by saying I have a good sense of humor, but that was bull. We all very clearly ordered one drink and there was nowhere on the coupon that said it was 2 for 1 per person. The drinks were SO weak and came in one of those glasses you get at fast food chains for free water (aka like 5 sips). The food and \"2 for 1\" drinks were so expensive and none of us actually enjoyed any of it. Yes, the hats were funny. Yes, the server was a dick. And I thought it was funny until he answered my question like that. He's not stupid. No one orders two drinks at once. Our bill was about $130 for four plates of gross food and \"2 for 1\" drinks we didn't ask for. Don't be scammed by this place. Spend your money elsewhere."

She handed us two cards and we went right to the bar with them. Told the bartender we had the cards and all he told us was that we needed to run two separate tabs. Being in the business we totally understood because we were giving him two coupons. As we went to cash out he went to hand us a tab of $26. We ordered a side of fries and thought our beers were free so we really should have only paid $6 with tax. All of a sudden tables turned and this free drink card turned into a buy one get one free card. The bartender handled the miscommunication very poorly and gave us a great amount of attitude. We argued back and forth and when I started to ask for his manager he completely ignored me and then finally told me I could go find her myself. Luckily, the manager came right around the corner. She handled the situation very well and I was very impressed with her customer service. If we were to go back it would be because of her but unfortunately we will not be going back due to that bartender and his AWFUL customer service.

Barry the bartender was a real hoot with a top notch personality. You get a tall paper hat that they write some funny saying on. Barry took a bit with mine, but nailed it. My hat read \" The health department closed my legs\" .hahaha. It was my daughters 21st bday. Her hat said \" Its my 21st and all I got was my period\" with ketchup smeared on it. So funny. If you don't know how to take a joke or comfortable with \"being roasted\" this place may not be for you. It is for those that have a sense of humor and want to laugh and not take things seriously. You also will get a balloon hat made for you. Ours was a super cute octopus with big lips.(they actually checked out my daughters tattoo and made the balloon to match it) We hated having to leave it in Vegas as it would not fit in our luggage. =( And finally the food. My daughter and I each ordered and then shared our plates. We got the Ribeye , and steak Caesar salad. We also had a coupon for a free appetizer and got Mozzarella sticks. The food was really really good. The drinks were a bit pricey. But were also very good. I had one drink and my daughter had 2. You get to keep the cups. Our bill came to $100 even.

Once we sat down my niece realized she left her wallet on the table at Dicks. After the show we went back. Luckily, the manager had noticed the wallet and put it aside. Assuming the worst we were happy to recover it with all the contents in tact. It might be called Dicks, we might expect to get treated a certain way but aside from that all of that the staff is stellar!! Especially Stephanie, Barry & James."

I had never been here before but was told by my dining mate that it would be an experience.\n\nLuckily had made a reservation because the wait was absurd.  We waited about 15 minutes to be seated despite having a reservation.\n\nI tried the fried pickles, fried cheese, and the fried shrimp.  All of these items were not good.  Also, water was not free.\n\nHonestly, I was surprised at how little we were teased and heckled by our server.  Additionally, we did not receive our hats until we were paying the check.  I would have appreciated more attention, because the infamous servers are such a huge part of the dining experience here.  I was definitely disappointed by my dining experience at Dick's."

He started off by just glaring at us as we walked in, and not even bothering to greet us. We approach the counter to order he scoffs and says \"Where are your IDs??\" He then checks our IDs and proceeds to TOSS them across the counter and looks at us and yells \"Now what do you want??\" Finally after our unpleasing encounter we grab our drinks and proceed to pay. Here is when we meet with another crappy sever... Each of our drinks came out to $17 and we both gave him a $20 bill. He then just takes our money, walks away, and doesn't give us our change...  He didn't ask if we needed change he just thanks us, says bye and continues on with his conversation with a coworker. Like wtf?! Are you seriously going to tip yourself after you did nothing and your old hag of a coworker scolded us?? Unbelievable. At this point my friend and I were so offended that we just walked out, letting those stupid servers take our change.  I get that the theme to this place is to act like a dick but at no point was there a joke cracked or any kind of sarcastic humor. Point is I will NEVER be coming back to that place."

So we were like let's Go! Well, only 3 of my family members got a hat and the rest didn't.  Bill was quick to give us our tab. So we thought ok maybe he will do our hats after we pay. Nope!!! I'm a Foodie Person I'm always out and about to try New Spots and if I Get Amazing service you as a Server Get a Amazing Tip. Well, tonight Bill got what he deserved as a Tip $20.00 bucks.

Servers talk shit to the customers, flip them off, throw napkins and cups at the people.  Customers also get to wear these paper hats where each one says something different, like my friends hat said \"I'm as easy as i look\". \n\nFood:  So it took us 45 minutes to get our food and there was only 4 people at our table, 3 of them ordered regular food and i ordered french fries (since im vegetarian there was nothing but french fries that i could eat here)  Everything in this place is fried, i'm surprised the drinks weren't fried too.  According to my friends, food was ok.  I don't think it was worth waiting 45 minutes.  My opinion go to the food court upstairs.\n\nI think Dick's throws away more trash then all of vegas because there's constantly napkins on the floor (tons of napkins) and the covers for the tables are paper.  Once you leave, they bunch up the plastic cups and paper covers and throw it away.  This is just stupid.  Whatever happened to washable table covers and cups? \n\nThe only reason i liked this place was because when i ordered water it was nice and cold with ice and the french fries were good (considering i was starving).  This place was not my cup of tea but for others it might be the best.  It is something different then the usual but i don't like getting treated like shit so if you do, enjoy."

Oh, and they dry hump, sing bad 80's tunes, and make foul sexual comments (all while their 300lb muffin-top is busting out of a thong *see pic*).

They continued to ignore us. Then someone came by, looked at us ignored us and then sat the folks last in line. Even they were aghast and murmured a quick, \"sorry\" to us. We asked to be given a table adding, \"We have been here a while.\" The guy threw the menus at us and said, \"Oh ya have have ya? Give me a break. Sit yourselves.\" We were like, \" WTH?\"  We were appalled but somehow I recognized something in a fellow actor. Maybe, it was the twinkle in his eye. So before I strangled him and demanded to see his manager, I poked my head into the restaurant to see what was up. Rude caveman sighs, loudly I might add, and begrudgingly walks us to our table. He asked if we had ever heard of the place or been in. When we said, \"no\" this is when all hell broke loose.  The \"stupid\" word was used, He yelled as he walked us to our table \" Coming through with some Moronic Newbies.\"  napkins were thrown at us, food passed by with phallic symbols on it, eye rolls of impatience and sympathy from the fellow staffers, etc and so forth. We sat there for about 2 minutes with our jaws on the table before we finally got the fact it was suppose to be this way. Then we rolled on the floor laughing. Of course this just gets the waiter even more annoyed with how silly and dumb we were. lol--- Thank God I am not a prude or embarrassed easily. To be honest I was embarrassed anyway. My friend starts to really get into it and I have to remind her she is a wife, mother, and grandmother so sit the heck down and behave. This is when we noticed the equally offensive slogans, posters hanging around on the walls, the waiter made hats on the fellow customers, and songs being sung for birthday patrons. \"My Dearie Goody Two Shoes Ears!\" YIKESAROONI!\n\nSo as you have gathered by now it is a themed restaurant where they purposely treat you nasty/saracastic/rude/raunchy etc. It gets dirty though so please do not bring kids here. There were tons here when we were there and that really bothered me since there is no warning sign out front. Also,do not go if you are offended by that sort of thing.\n\nWhat was really fun was whenever a new person comes in. People sit here all day to watch their confused faces, like ours, before they get the joke. It is like the customers are the audience and you are the new actors on stage. When the group of four 80 plus year old's came in and sat next to us we could not control our laughter over their confused and outraged faces. My friend and I were laughing so hard that helped them catch on and finally figured it out. It is an interesting human psychology experiment to watch. Human nature at it's best. Go Gramps and Grams because they were getting into it too! After eating We never wanted to leave the place. We were having so much fun.\n\nOh to review the food, what food? Don't ask us about the food. We honestly have no idea because we do not remember. We do remember the food and restaurant is beach themed if that helps.\n\nWe finally got up to leave after an hour and the manager says, So how was everything?\" Before we could answer he says, \"Well it had better have been good. You took long enough. Your friend there was all over my man server. Now get the hell out of my place.\" Brawhahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!! We'll be back next week. JK or are we?"

But bad service and ridiculous prices, and an ugly wait staff force one to make you say \"why the hell did I ever go here?\". The staff plays their parts well, being total bitches. That's fine. But if you do that than be fucking hot. Like porn star hot. And at the VERY least, get the orders right and LISTEN to what we're paying almost 200.00 for. I could have easily played along had this waitress, who I am doing a kindness keeping her name out of this review, had gotten our order right, taken the time to listen to a damn thing we said, and delivered my friend his Sprite. I mean how long can it take to deliver a spite? I guess in this case of a totally inept wait staff, who couldn't get a job at Denny's, the better part of two hours. The terms, \"you're fired\", \"what kind of idiot am I to choose such a place\", and \"don't quit your day job\" come to mind. You're better off going to McDonalds. Embarrassing that this place exists inside a Las Vegas casino charging stupid prices. Never again. \n\nHad my fianc\u00e9 not been in charge of the bill, I would have walked out without paying a cent. Which was frankly MORE than this inept waitress deserved. Positive: The hats were funny. Fire your staff and start from scratch. Bitchy is a turn on folks. But only if they actually do their jobs and listen. Lucky I didn't throw my drink in their faces. \n\nIf you're stupid enough to ever go to this place, you get what you deserve, as I did. My mistake. \nWhat the bloody fuck was I thinking?"

After being seated, we looked around and found the game on, but then it was switched over to another game. When the server brought out our drinks, I said something about it and asked if we could get it on at least one of the screens. He said that we could not and that there was nothing he could do about it. I apologized, but said we would have to go, and left our drinks untouched and unpaid for. As we were leaving, a party of four came in wearing Seahawks gear. I informed them that they refused to turn the game on for us, and they turned around and walked out with us too.

Then of course the 11 year old wearing the questionable hat with the saying 'I'm living proof the pill is only 99 percent effective!'\n\nWhat I didn't really care for was the little kid that looked like a 2 year old having her balloon popped next to her ear when she was not expecting it which started her crying.  Then the guy came back and gave her another balloon and said 'don't worry I won't pop this balloon' then less than 30 seconds later he cut the tie on the balloon sending it floating to the ceiling which started her crying again and then guess what?? Yeah the balloon popped.  Anyways the family seemed to be laughing about it even with the kid crying.  I didn't get it.  The kid still had a face full of tears 30 to 45 minutes later when the family all left.  That didn't seem like fun.

But all I saw were these fat sweaty wanna-be mean people boys.  HAHA!  They were definitely dicks, and their were their infamous rude hates of course.  Here are some they wrote on my visit:\n\n- I'm so small, I pee on my balls.\n- Happy ending $5\n- Deposit here (with a hole for where the mouth is)\n- It's razor burn, not herpes.\n- When I was a man, my name was Steve.\n- I choke my chicken to Little Mermaid.\n- I lost my virignity to Moses.\n\nThe girl that had the \"Deposit here\" hat, I felt bad for her.  The waiter got \"all the guys\" attention, (Yes, she was an attractive girl.) and pulled the hat down to where the mouth matched the hat's whole.  I felt so bad for her!\n\nThe food here, I thought was freaking delicious! I ordered the \"Big Ass Burger\" and it was superb!\n\nService, sucked for obvious reason.  The fat guy, ran around the tables with butcher paper screaming for us to pick everything off the table so he could throw it on as our tablecloth.  Threw our water cups at us.  We had 5 at our table, he threw way more than that.  The utensils were metal and he dropped it on the table.  When the food came, he slid everything off his serving platter.\n\nWell, this place is definitely for someone with a sense of humor.  It's all fun and games, until he puts a hat on you.

This is how the restaurant is and if you can't handle that, I wouldn't suggest coming here. \n\nThe waitress we had was really nice, but she acts like an asshole because that's her job description. They write these things on a big piece of paper and make you wear it as a hat, but they say dirty things in the paper. \n\nI have it a four star because I didn't like the food options. The drink we shared was really good and definitely worth getting as you get to keep the cup. \n\nI also wouldn't suggest bringing your kids here either..a family took their children to this restaurant but weren't seated as close to the stage they had or the bar. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the atmosphere, even if people are assholes to you, but they're all really nice in the end.

If you are sensitive to teasing or opposed to crude humor, then I would avoid this place at all costs, but I have a pretty good sense of humor and went along with the whole \"be rude to the customer\" shtick.\n     We ordered frozen drinks, which were a bit pricey, but I expected nothing less being in Vegas. The decor was very funky and interesting, complete with ladies' undergarments hanging around the bar. They also give patrons paper hats to wear with crass sayings on them, like \"I stuff my training bar\", that being one of the tamer phrases. Overall we had a fun time, and it's a good place to stop at and relax during the day."

But then we realized that we came thru the wrong entrance and the hostess were on the other side. So when we went to the hostess they told us to sit at this long table that had another group on the end. There were different wooden seats at the tables that said different phrases like \"Property of Dicks\" and \"Im with Stupid\". The waiter came and pointed to the menu that was written with chalk on a board on the wall across from us. He then said \"I know you probably cant see it, so get ur ass up to go read it\". So we did LOL. He also handed us a drink menu. My friend and I order the big appetizer platter to share, she was satified with it, but I was still hungry :( The food was good tho, but not above average. We each ordered a drink, I actually dont remembered what I ordered but it tasted good but it was also suprisingly strong. They served the drinks in these cheap little plastic cups.  The waiter was cute and funny. He wasnt really mean to us, he just had a lot of sexual humor and kind of flirted with us. He made us these paper hats and put them on our heads. Mine said \"Flava Flave is my baby daddy\" and my friend's said \"I love anal\". I asked the waiter to take a pic with me and he took grabbed my leg and put it around him when we took the pic. Then my friend responded \"her husband wouldnt like that\" (disclaimer: I'm not really married, it was a joke). The waiter said, well how bout this, then he took off his shirt, bent me over and flipped the camera off. So all in all we had a good time, and I was tipsy by the time I left...smh..."

Granted, we're responsible for ourselves but please, God, if you're going there and are on a budget- be sure to ask the prices of the drinks before you order as they will not tell you on purpose.  There's also no descriptions of the food on the menu either.  \nI'm from Toronto and made a reservation there for last Saturday for all of us to have dinner together. Our server was alright and the food came relatively quickly- but I felt very neglected by him as not even everyone in my party received hats and I don't think he even spoke to half of us.  Maybe my expectations were too high or they were just overly busy- but this was the one time that my entire group from Toronto was going to be together and I think maybe I just expected much more.  He maybe \"insulted\" two people and gave half of us hats over the course of an hour and a half and that was the end of it.  Kinda brutal.  Go for the experience, not for the food- but set your expectations low for that, too.  It might be better if the place is less busy and your party is much smaller.\nThey also don't do anything for birthdays either unless you're the lucky chosen one to receive a lap dance from an overweight naked guy.  I wasn't so lucky. Damn."

It is the waiter's job to yell at you, call you names, and place silly paper hats with silly sayings on your head.  Of the 4 of us in our group, they chose me for one of their hats.  Mine read, \"I have a crush on Dr. Phil\".  Everytime the waiters pass your table by, they hurl insults at everyone & heaven forbid you should need something & ask for it.  They do bring it to you, but be prepared to have it thrown at you along with a hurling insult.  I ordered the hamburger and I thought it was quite good.  The whole concept of Dick's is pretty neat, but i think for us it was as much fun as it could have been because they sat us off to the side of the restaurant while everyone else was in the middle, near the stage.  Maybe because of our ages?  I don't care if I'm 90, I would want to be where all the fun is.  As far as prices go, I guess you just need to expect it, after all you are in Vegas and since the mob no longer runs it, corporate America does, you can forget excellent food deals."

If you can't take a joke or roll with the punches I suggest you not go to Dick's.  Believe it or not the food was actually good.  The waiters are hilarious and pick on you or anyone in your party, maybe you all get picked on.  They make these hats made of rolled paper and there is always a message for others to read and laugh. I would definitely go back there on my next visit to Vegas."

Then he just had a snarling face and seemed annoyed when I didn't know what I wanted. I asked my friend if she thought I offended him. Then I heard one server snapping at a customer next to me and read what some people were wearing on their head and I asked my friend \" where are we\" I was mouth dropped shocked at things around me and I said this has to be a joke or something and was going to yelp at the moment of all that was going on til I realized from yelp that it's called dicks because the staff.... I actually prefer the kindness of service in eating out so it's not my thing but if I were in my 20s and in Vegas I may have enjoyed the interaction but I'm a grown woman... The food wa okay; I liked the BBQ brisket and pulled pork but the sides tasted like box food like fake mashed potato and fake Mac and cheese and I don't eat boxed food. Both are simple sides to make from scratch so I expect a $22 plate to not contain a just add water side. Only went there because we went to a show in that hotel and the dining it opens were limited to food court and a couple resturants; I will probably not be returning to this spot mainly because I do not believe in such a concept in any service establishment."

She says to me \"like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get,\" I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying \"right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?\" then just turned around and walked away. \n\nI'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!?

We also got a warning from the hostess as she walked us to our table.  Our waitress was great.  We were both a little stunned when she threw a piece of butcher paper on the table and told us to clear everything off so that we could put it down as a table cloth.

My niece, who is only 19, tried to order a virgini daiquiri but the waitress told her they don't make virgin drinks.  She gave me a hard time for drinking soda instead of alcohol, too.  When she came back with our drinks, she had a virgin daiquiri for my niece.  She slapped it down on the table with a \"here you little four year old.  Here is your baby drink\".  Ha ha!  She was great!\n\nThere was a DJ who played music.  Every once in a while he would make us clap, sing, etc.  He was placed up high and could see the whole bar.  When he spotted someone who wasn't participating he would call them out.  He yelled at one girl saying \"Hey girl with too much makeup on.  How do you put that much makeup on to go out and then sit there not clapping?\"  Too funny.\n\nThe best part was when he made fun of the large group of people who had brought their young children out to the place.  He had us boo them for bringing their kids.  The kids, meanwhile, all had at least 6 helium balloons tied into their hair making it stand on end.  The boys had hats that said \"I have an itchy bum and a stinky finger\" or \"I thought it was a fart\".\n\nMy niece got a hat that said \"My mom still thinks I'm a virgin\".  \n\nI'll agree the food wasn't the best.

The tables were pushed up next to each other so that our backs were touching the people behind us. \nThe service and the experience were what was expected: dancing, sing alongs, playing games, loud music, crude hats, rude service, watered down drinks, greasy/unhealthy food, and a chance to get rowdy and wild. \nI think this is a great place for tourists--one time in your life is enough. \nI saw a few people with their infant children which I thought was outrageous.\n After almost 2 hours there I could have used some earplugs. \nOur bill came out to 200$ \nMy friend had a good time and that is what matters."

What you really come for is the experience, and for Taco. The theme of the restaurant is that it is literally your last resort for food because the service is so \"bad\". The servers put on a rude front and play jokes on you and make each guest wear a hat with a provocative saying. It is honestly a lot of fun and a great place to go with a group for a birthday, bridal party or even just for fun. \n\nIt is a lot of fun and a must do if you are in Vegas. It;s great to see the servers improvise, especially when they hear it is not your first time. \n\nPs. Taco is a bartender who literally tattooed taco on his stomach.

The mozzarella sticks were nasty! When they first came out they were cold so we sent them back and when they came back (at the same time our other plates came out) they were warm so we ended up just throwing them out. My cajun pasta was alright, if the noodles weren't overcooked I could imagine it being a good plate but we had already sent the mozzarella sticks back and I didn't want to send my plate back because the place is called Dicks so I can only imagine what they would like to do if I sent another plate back. The boyfriend's the catfish was the highlight of the meal, it is the best piece of fried fish I have ever had. If I could give stars just for the fish I would it 5 stars - it was perfectly crispy, there wasn't an excess oil like most other fried food has and I really couldn't get enough of it. We ended up just sharing his plate. \n\nThe service was hella funny which we both were enjoying - talking shit back to the waiter, listening to the stupid shit he would say to the other customers (he kept calling an older woman grandma!) and those hats they give out are hilarious. My hat said \"I make white trash look sexy\" and my boyfriends said \"Still waiting for the other ball to drop.\" \n\nIf it was just me and the boyfriend I don't think we'd come back but if we came with friends or family and they wanted to try it out I wouldn't mind tagging along."

It is located inside the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSupposedly but not sure, this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant.  The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service.  When you first walk in, the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about. You could say yes or no while you are being seated. But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and can't help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls.  Or you'll hear profanity being shouted by the servers... of course in the name of fun.  \n\nBelieve it or not,  the food and drinks here are quite good.  We ordered a bacon burger, a local moco, and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush, an iced tea, and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries. \n\nThe bacon burger was huge. It's prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries.  It was good.  The local moco was also delicious. The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath.  It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second.   The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal.  I really did not expect anything special. I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else. Oh boy, I was wrong! The rib eye was cooked medium, and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces. It was served with steamed vegetables, but the meat was delicious with flavor.  The iced tea is just iced tea,  but their spiked slushies are awesome.  It's sweet and is fruity... very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it.  However,  the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though... haha.\n\nFyi, all the food and drinks ordered is for three people. In case you thought I was a big eater, which i am. Haha. \n\nDick's is a very fun place to hang out.  Good food and drinks makes a difference. The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude.  But you must be able to not get offended easily from what's said, and be cool.  Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks.\n\nEnjoy your time there and cheers!"

Beware they pick on all ages young and old, but it's all in good fun. I really enjoyed their drink specials and had a good burger. Unlike some other locations this is shared table seating."

You really do need a sense of humor if you plan to take a seat and I really did have a few good laughs...mostly at other peoples expense.  The staff was not as rude as I am seeing in other reviews but if you were at a table with fewer people than you got less attention. My biggest issue is the value. In hindsight I realize it's up to me to ask more questions when ordering but if your like me and you're blissfully \"mid-western\" simplistic than you're in for some serious sticker shock. My wife and I shared an appetizer and each ordered a 32 oz drink and while we waited we decided on a shot. So 1 plate, 2 drinks, and 2 shots came to $101 dollars!!! The shots alone were $16 bucks each! Conveniently none of the drink prices were listed. In conclusion, if you're just financially loaded or just better prepared than I was then I say go for it!  But if you're not...I STILL say go for it!  Just stick with water and get you buzz on somewhere else."

I definitely wouldn't want to bring your uppity mother-in-law here, odds are she won't get the jokes. The servers are vulgar (in a funny way!), they're loud, and the put you on the spot, big time!

If you don't know how to laugh at yourself...again, don't come here.\n\nI'm sorry to say that the food IS outrageously priced...$20 for a burger and fries...what??! \n\nBut the decently priced drinks made up for that.

Let me explain.\n\nThe hotel sends out this guy (totally cool dude Justin) to hand out little coupons good for a free Jello shot or a 2-for-1 beer, obviously trying to get people to go visit, for a reason.  The venue itself isn't all that bad.  Looks like a pretty decent-sized dive bar full with a bunch of bench seating and a stage where they can host various bands.\n\nThe problem isn't with the venue, it's with the staff.  The 2 female bartenders and that one male bar-back obviously didn't like being there at all.  They weren't rude to me, but they were rude to my friends.  Sure everyone can have a bad day... but 3 days in a row?  Geesh they need to find a more suitable job for their own sake.\n\nLooks like a good place for Bachelorette parties... must have seen 8 of them going through the 3 days I was there.

Our waiter was good - he had fun sexually harassing us most of the evening. \nYou will notice right away that the servers make hats that have obscene remarks written on them for their patrons to wear. At first I wasn't happy about the thought of having to wear a paper hat all night, but once we got in there I didn't mind at all! At my table they read as follows:\nMy hat said \"Ask me about my chlamydia.\" \nThe birthday girl's said \"all I got for my birthday was my period.\" \nDanielle's hat said \"I HEART ANAL.\"\nand finally Bree got \"My vagina is a gaping hole of disappointment\" (this last one I thought was a little harsh, but whatever)! \nThe food at Dick's is very average, but they bring it out quickly after you order and they make strong drinks ---so we were satisfied!"

The ribs reminded me of something slow roasted in an oven all day, and aside from the sauce didn't have much of a BBQ taste to them at all. Wings were overcooked, and then heavily sauced.

I mean, they aren't the most creative, but they are better than just saying, \"douchebag.\" The server's attitude was great for the place. He was sarcastic but would actually help you.

The table wasn't fully wiped down and it's just dirty everywhere. \n\nThe food. You should stick to bar food. Don't go for jumbalaya or anything.

We went with people from out of town so it was a hoot for them. I can take it or leave it. It's worth a trip down to experience it. That's about it. It's not my favorite restaurant.

The burger is good. The steak sandwhich not so much.  \n\nDick's is one of those fun for groups type of restaurants you should visit when you and the crew have been walking and drinking tiredlessly up and down the Vegas strip.  I  think everyone working there and acting like a dick is a lot better than going to other places where the food sucks and they are not ACTING like dick's but they are dick's."

Curiosity piqued, I decided to check the place out.\n\nDick's Last Resort has a 'schtick': the servers are intentionally rude and make fun of patrons here, and the funny hats are apparently part of the gag.  Sounds like it might be fun, so I looked at the menu; typical of most casino restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip everything was way overpriced.  Ya know, I just don't see the point of paying a premium to be insulted.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants around with surly staff where customers can get a more 'authentic' insulting/rude treatment without paying a premium for it!\n\nOn the bright side, Dick's features live music by a decent classic rock/pop cover band-- which can be enjoyed at a more tolerable volume (and with cheaper drinks) from the nearby slot machines on the casino floor"

As soon as I found out what they do, I thought to myself, \"why has no one done this before?\"\n\nDick's Last Resort is a restraunt inside the Excalibur Hotel & Casino that prides itself in it's sense of humor. At Dick's the waitstaff are rude, crude, inappropriate, and HIGHLY unprofessional....... on purpose. And they expect you to do the same. Dick's is a place where social constraints and political correctness are left at the door with your hat and coat.\n\nOur waitress walked up to us, threw our utensils and napkins on the table, tossed us some menus and said \"hurry up and decide what you want!\" I fell in love with this place immediately. The best part was when you have a real question about something (like a menu option) she would switch into real waitress-mode and answer your question.... then mercilessly make fun of you for asking such a dumb question. hahaha.\n\nOur waitress was so great at her job, she actually scared away an older Asian family who sat next to us. I don't think they knew the point of Dick's and didn't appreciate the sarcasm. Our waitress did the same routine with the utensils and menus, but when she returned to take their order, they hadn't decided yet. She asked \"do you all speak English?\" to which a meek \"yes\" must have been uttered, and she followed it up with \"well then liven up a little bit, jeez.\" and she walked away. The eldest lady at the table was already halfway out the restraunt by that point! My wife and I were in tears laughing so hard!\n\nThe food was amazing too! My wife had the pulled pork plate and I had the BBQ beef brisket with ribs. Perfection on a plate was what was served to me. I loved it all!\n\nI will most definately be returning to Dick's Last Resort the next time I go to Vegas. 5 stars all the way!"

I understand that the whole idea of this restaurant is for the waiters to mistreat you and be jerks to you and your party, but it just makes for an uncomfortable experience if you want to order something else or make any additional requests such as asking for an extra utensil or a drink refill. Our waitress took our orders and immediately ran off before we could decide on an appetizer. When she came back, I told her we wanted to order an appetizer and she screamed at me saying I should've ordered \"like a big girl\" before she left the table. She didn't even give us a chance to do this because she left so quickly! Yes, I understand being rude is their concept but there should be a certain point in which they still at least try to accommodate for their guests. \n\nThe food is nothing to rave about either. Their menu doesn't have a lot of options besides a bunch of overpriced fried food. I ordered the half rack of ribs that came with fries and the fries were stale. The ribs were a bit dry and could've used more barbecue sauce.\n\nWe also told our waitress that one of our friends in our party was celebrating his birthday and she yelled \"Nobody cares!!!!\" We thought they'd do something humorous since it was his birthday but it went completely ignored.

We were not given any hat's, but our server did give our son what some would call \"a motorboat\". Thus he had yet to eat, yet loved this place already.\n\nThe third time we went I was given a hat that read \"I Fondle Myself During Nascar\". By now I was ready, I read the hat, looked at our server and said \"How did you know?\" During our third visit we were with my sister-in-law. The sister-in-law and I ordered the same kind of soda with our meal. What we were served was a small bucket with said soda inside it. With two straws. Now that I think of it, I hope she didn't backwash in that straw.\n\nThe fourth time the wide and I went it was just us. The wife and I, not the sister-in-law, not the now early twenty-something son.

Examples - she just threw the napkins, beer cups and forks onto the table, yelled at us for not being ready to order and had little nicknames for some of us.\n\nDo some of the remarks made by the waitstaff border on cruel and degrading, ABSOLUTELY, but that's what makes this place so great.

Also learned Valet is best when coming South on Tropicana. It is a fun place that is completely open to the Casino. That part can be awkward with so many walking by watching you be humiliated...at least the Birthday girl was.  LOL!  Tables and chairs for those interested.

She is always available, and answered every question. She was awesome at getting me exactly what I wanted at my birthday. \nHostesses at the door, not my favorite. Brook the manager, jumped right in and made me feel very welcomed, he also fixed any issues I had. \nWaitress, she was cool, but not very funny. Oh well, she was still a cool chic.

We had the bachelorette package, so we had nachos and apps to start and small meals to choose from for a set price.  It also included Jell-O shots and a large frozen drink for the bday girl. :)\nNachos - 3/5 decent. I didn't eat much though...just like 2 bites.  \nAppetizer tray - 3/5 nice section of mozzarella sticks, hot wings, chicken strips and fried pickles.  My fav were the fried pickles. I ate a bunch of these. \nNow, of the plate see could chose from, I got the fried shrimp (2.5/5) on the waitresses suggestion, but man do I wish I would have gotten the brisket (4/5).  I tried one bite of my friend's, and it was yum!  This is not brisket for those that like it lean, but those like me who enjoy some fat on it.  Wish I would have chosen that!!!! Oh well. \nThe other mark down was the bill. They put it all on one.  What a mess!!!!\n\nOverall: what a fun place to have a get together!  Probably won't do it for a few more years, and won't do it again until I can drink, but I still had a great birthday thanks to Emily!!!  And thanks Brook, and especially my new boyfriend Taco!!!

Just what my wife and I are used to! \n\nWe decided to come back again with some friends, thinking they would have just as much fun as us. Unfortunately there were different people working when we came back and they were not the same kind of \"Dick\". Seemed like the rudeness was not an act this time, they were just plain rude. Maybe I was wrong, maybe I had too many drinks in me at that point, but everyone I was with seemed to get the same vibe. We asked the girl up front if we could get a table and have some drinks since there was not enough room at the bar for our party of 6, and she said it wasnt her problem that there wasnt enough room at the bar for us. Ok. So I asked again, well can we sit at a table? She said the tables are for people that are eating. Ok. So I guess we wont be drinking here. She then says we could sit at a \"picnic table\" but would have to get our own drinks from the bar. Ok no problem. So we sit down at the first picnic table we see and a couple of us go to the bar for drinks. The girl that just told us we could sit at a picnic table yells at us \"Not that picnic table, you have to sit at one of those back there in the corner!\" Ok. We get it, we sat at the wrong picnic table and you're supposed to be rude. \n\nSo we move to the back corner. Waited for a bit at the bar to order a drink, trying to get someone's attention but I guess because we weren't actually sitting at the bar we did not matter, or they were just being rude? They did not appear to be that busy. Finally got a girl to wait on me and tipped her a buck. We used our 2 for 1 drink coupons that a guy outside the bar gave us, then left.  \n \nWill probably come back, but will be prepared for bad service disguised as rudeness."

I'm a quiet bar, good whiskey, long rambling conversation, sort of girl. Dick's is...conducive to these things.\n\nOne of our party kept hitting himself in the nuts with the yard long slushie tube around his neck. So that was how the night was gonna be, and these are my friends. I had chosen to be here. So it is in that context, I review Dick's Last Resort.\n\nThe Bachelor in question had a blast. So that was the first and foremost goal. Accomplished. Our \"Dick\" waiter was actually quite funny, and had the tact to realize who could take, and wanted to take the brunt of his ribbing, (Hint. He kept hitting himself in the nuts with a 3 foot slurpee. Surprise.) Or maybe he just went for the low-hanging frozen fruit. Either way, he dished it out pretty evenly with liberte and egalete and fraternite, and then focused like a comedic laser. The show was definitely the best part of the experience, and makes me want to hike the review to four stars.\n\nIt's the combination of food/beer, and price point that prevent me from doing so. I had hot wings (a side of hooters quips) which were pretty good, the sauce tasted an awful lot like Franks RedHot, and some mozzerella sticks, which were...okay. Damned tasty after I had my second beer. But woah, that beer was expensive. Even for the strip. The whole bill was somewhere around $60. For 2 beers and 2 appetizers, pre-tip for the entertainment. Yeah.\n\nThe food wasn't that much more amazing than a TGIFridays type place; less of a frozen gloppy taste but still not worth $60 for wings and mozzarella sticks. I knew it was gonna be spendy, but at the end of a 'meh' meal, it's pretty hard to swallow plopping down a cool hundred for bud, decent entertainment and food you didn't particularly like. \n\nYou go to Dicks for the show, but be prepared to pay Strip Inflated prices. I think the next time I go I'll eat before I head out there, and then my budget won't hurt so bad."

We were seated quickly because of the amount of seating available. Believe me when I tell you, there is a lot of seating. The decor is very flashy. Not in a gaudy way, but in a fun have a good time way. There was a man making the most incredible balloon creations I have ever seen. And he made them each so quickly. They were not all animals so I cannot say he was making balloon animals. They were balloon creations. He made a seahorse and a little puppy, but he also made a little mermaid. I was and still am impressed. Dick's is a theme restaurant. The theme is service with an attitude. Our waiter seemed like he was trying to do his part of being rude. But it did not seem rude so much. He did make sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there.\n\nI ordered a Big A__ Burger with cheese and bacon. The burger was a half pounder, was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor. The bacon was the same. Juicy, not to crisp, and flavorful. The bun was very light and flaky making it a perfect burger. I have to be honest and say that the fries were not the best I have ever had. But, the fries were crisped just right and had a very good flavor to them as well. For not the best they were pretty darned good. My wife had the Steak Sammich. I did not taste it, but she said it was very good.\n\nI am looking forward to going back to Dick's. I can't wait to try the tri-tip, brisket, ribs, pork and other items on the menu."

The waitress wrote something about meeting me at the 'happy ending' salon.. Nice eh.. any ways,.. if you have a sense of humor, don't mind vulgarity then it can be a entertaining place to dine. Also, there is the bar man who does a water show to music. The food and drinks where your typical $$$$.

We know the drill expecting \"rude, sarcastic, and dirty banter\" which we got by the hostess but not really by the waiter. They weren't that busy and it just seemed like the waiters weren't on it. It took almost an hour for us to find out our order had been lost by the kitchen and we would have to reorder our food again. My husband finally spoke to a manager who apologized and said she would have our meal out to us in no time which she did. We were a table 8 so I was pretty impressed that she did have our food out in like 15 minutes. She was very nice and I think felt really bad that we were now gonna be late to our bungy jump at the stratosphere. So she took care of the whole bill, which was very much appreciated!!!  A few things we did notice that have changed since we were here last:\n\nFirst the menu, they have a \"dinner\" menu which was pretty small with very few options and we were told we couldn't order anything that wasn't on \"dinner menu\" like a chicken sandwich. They only had a burger. The chicken sandwich I guess is on the \"lunch menu\"\nSecond is the paper hats. No one in our party got one even though it was my brothers bday. There were also very few ppl wearing them in the restaurant that night. Almost like they dont bother with them anymore.\nThird the prices seems to have gone way up. The drinks were super expensive and the food was ridiculous. Almost $20 for a burger. And it wasn't anything special. \nAll that being said the balloon guy was absolutely the highlight of our experience. I think he was trying to make up for the mistakes in the kitchen. He was vulgar, sarcastic, and damn talented! He is really the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars. If we lived in Vegas I'd totally hire him for all my events. He had us all laughing and changed the whole mood of the table."

As we entered and got seated it seemed to be ok and funny!  We understood the concept of this restaurant 100%.  We read the is and isn't board before entering.  There might have been poor judgement on the waitress behalf and we were treated very poorly. She turned us over to another waitress and one person from our party was singled out and no service for that person.  The waitress out load called someone from our party rude and uncalled for names. If they didn't want to serve us as a whole party for whatever reason we should have been asked to leave and given a reason for such actions. There was absolutely no reason to have been treated as we did. We didn't even get a manager to come over.  This waitress served many tables around us and introduced herself and explained the concept. It was not done to us.  It was very uncomfortable and was too late to leave. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

A bit awkward cause we didn't know how to react but still funny.\n\nWith the waitress, the only thing that I was offended by from all her sarcasm was when she created my hat. She put \"I've had more Mexicans inside of me than a Home Depot parking lot\" Being that I am Hispanic and a female, I felt that was very rude and I was offended. I took that hat off right away. I didn't that was funny at all. I have a really good sense of humor, but that hat made me feel uncomfortable. \n\nFood: We got our food which I though was overly priced. I got Fish and Chips which was about 18.00 and my boyfriend got Chicken Tenders for about the same price. We expected something great since the prices were so high. Boy were we wrong.

The worst part was how it was warm as if they had just recooked it again cause even the color of the fries looked old - like they didn't change the oil in a while. (i worked in the food industry) So when the waiter came I asked for new fries. The Fish was just as bad. Very very greasy it had no flavor just tasted like grease. Chicken tenders was about the same stale and hard. We right away asked for the check there was no way we were gonna eat this. \n\nWhen we asked for our check she looked at out plates and asked why we didn't eat and we let her know the reasons. She told us, \"I bet you are used to Applebees that's why\" and we told her ... \"Well, yeah we would have actually preferred Applebees and enjoyed it better for less of the cost\".  We were very pleased when she removed our plate off the bill. I was actually very surprised. \n\n\nThe overall experience was just that an experience and I am glad we tried it. But for the high prices  and the poor quality of food. We will not be going back."

I giggled. When we asked for menus the bartender simply pointed at some chalkboard with food scribbled on it. A bit later the bartender came around and tossed a handful of napkins in the air at us and made it rain napkins, I was thoroughly confused.\n\n I ordered some burger thing and my friend ordered a salad. My burger tasted bad and my friend didn't like her salad much more.\n\nWhen our plates were cleared one of the girls told me to \"move my shitty phone\". It was only after that remark I realized what Dick's was about, I only wish I knew sooner, I was in awe of the horrible service, but now I realize it was purposely like that. I guess the jokes on me.

The food isn't too bad, my brisket sandwich was overflowing with BBQ sauce and meat and I wanted a fork, but my waiter said I could stop being a pansy and eat with my fingers. When asked for a glass of water, he said that we're in the middle of the desert and that the water was being saved for Taco's water show. Bottom line though our drinks and food came out pretty fast and there weren't any complaints. At a table next to us, a mom had brought her kids with her. She was wearing a paper hat with 'MILF' written across it by the waiter. She wasn't aware of what it meant.  Our waiter said if we didn't tell her, he wouldn't bring us our drinks. I don't think I'll ever see teenage boys' faces be any redder than they were. We let her know and she was pretty red in the face too. Good times. Parents should have Urban Dictionary saved on their websites to keep up with the times, though cmon...everyone knows what a MILF is.\n\nAh, Taco. The man that makes this joint run. He'll give bachelorettes a lap dance while he sports a thong hanging out of his pants. Too hot to handle!! He popped in a Grease sing-a-long DVD and made his own commentary that was pretty entertaining, along with making old men dance with the videos for free drinks. But his crowning achievement is his water show. A spin off the Bellagio fountains, I won't give anything away but you'll be laughing your ass off by the time its over.\n\nBase humor and crude jokes run rampant so if you have a stick in your ass, go somewhere else."

Borderline rude-obnoxious servers literally throwing silverware and straws on your park bench table you'll most likely share with new friends (for a little while, anyway).  I had the steak and shrimp for $20 and a Coors Light for $5.  Steak was actually very tender and the cocktail sauce for the shrimp had a nice little spicy zip.  One of our group had the porterhouse and someone had the big ass burger.\n\nIssue we had was that three dinners, two small beers, two Maker's Marks and three 50oz. beers came to $185.  After some number crunching, we discovered that the server took the liberty of giving herself an 18% tip and that the 50's were $17.  Course my share of the bill (tax/tip/etc) should have been $30, but the guy in our group with the burger didn't chip in enough, so I got to make up the difference.  Yes, yes...I know.  This specifically doesn't reflect on Dick's but is the main reason why I hate dining with groups.\n\nThe \"sing along or we play bad songs\" gimmick was fun, as well as reading each others hats.  Winners include: a gal that just got married (\"I'm married, I don't have to give blowjobs anymore\") and one of our guys in our group (\"I'm the reason some women become lesbians\").  The rotund gentleman wearing a thong and giving lap dances was disturbing.

After a little poker win (we'll take it!) we wanted a little celebration.  Walking through the Excalibur we saw several signs that welcomed the bull riders and advertising $5 shots of Jack Daniels.  Sounded like just what the doctor ordered.  We ducked into Dick's Last Resort off the casino floor.  It's fun and funny--like Ed Debevic's in LA, the staff is faking rudeness, part of the schtick.    Here's what's NOT funny.  We ordered a shot and a beer.  Want a regular or a large (\"Big Ass\") beer?  Hey, we're celebrating and large, I thought, is always a better deal.  The bill came, and the $5 shot was $7.  What about the signs?  \"We don't know anything about that.\"  The large beer was FOURTEEN DOLLARS.  Are you kidding?? The price wasn't listed anywhere on the bar, and the bartender never mentioned the price; I know I should have asked beforehand how much, but I NEVER would have thought it was that high.  When I asked, it was explained to me that I got to keep the \"glass\" (a cheapo plastic thing you might get at a picnic) and could get a great deal on refills:  EIGHT DOLLARS.  The prices are lower at the high end Cosmopolitan down the strip.  It's a rip off pure and simple.  Dick's and the Excalibur are betting people won't complain.  Wrong.

In my drunken state I kept shouting FREEBIRD!\nBut nobody took me up on it. I then tried to order some blackened\nFreebird but they said it wasn't on the menu. About the time some\nbig bouncer oaf started heading my way we got out of there and headed\nfor Dick's. If you wanna be a dick, head towards a place where you \ncan get away with it. So some chump standing outside the place gave\nus 2-for-1 drink cards and we took advantage of them immediately.\nThere was some band playing a lot of 80's classic rock and hair metal\nand it was pretty much a good time. When we first walked in, though, \nI saw all these girls with white hats - looked like a klan meeting\nwhere they forgot to cover their faces. Then I noticed some really\ngoofy stuff written on the hats. Didn't make sense but I already \nwas 3 or 4 mixed drinks to Sunday and not a whole lot was making\nsense by that time. The bartender didn't insult us though. I was a\nbit disappointed. Maybe that was above her pay grade. Or maybe she\njust had the sense of humor of a TV test pattern. I'll never know.\nOh yeah. They sell all sorts of T-shirts that very tastefully and\nartfully use the name of the place - the type a short bus ridin' 3rd\ngrader would take at least a whole minute to come up with."

I liked the silliness of it... it had a frat boy kind of vibe... not my scene... but no big deal... My friend and I sat down at the first bar, a bartender flew by, and we asked if this bar was open... She said she didn't know... So we sauntered over to the other main bar. One bartender was flirting with two girls. No big deal... but we are waiting... waiting... another bartender comes by... maybe we would get help. She then starts also flirting with the two girls... Uhhh... hello? Its been 15 - 20 minutes no help. One bartender out of five is actually working... totally ignored... I finally went up to them. Hey... if you all could stop flirting for just one moment and give us a drink. that would be awesome... No apologies, nothing, we just ended up flipping each other off.... and I ended up walking out... we would of dropped a bunch of money on that place, that hotel, etc... but never again will I set foot in the hotel or the bar..... Avoid this place. It sucks..."

I cant remember his name it was a hispanic name.. he has dark hair and wears glasses.. loved him!

The do a great job bringing the concept to life but in reality I feel like they take it too far. \n\nIf it is your first time they'll explain to you the run down of the restaurant. After that, the gloves are off. When taking our initial order we didn't even get a chance to order our appetizers. When our waitress walked by, i asked to order an appetizer and she didn't even acknowledge me. I also wanted to clarify if free appetizer on yelp would work if i check in. Literally 5 minutes before our food came out a server brought out our food. \n\nThe food overall is ok, nothing special honestly. Typical bar food, decent bbq, french fries weren't any good. They charge you for \"tap\" water. But for the price we paid, the food is definitely not worth it. When we got the bill, our waitress said the redeem a free appetizer on yelp doesn't apply to the appetizer we ordered. WHICH WE WOULDNT HAVE ORDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGED US AND TOLD US IN THE FIRST PLACE. \n\nOverall I give it 2 out 5 stars. Would I go back, not unless someone I knew really wanted to go. I'd rather go eat at a food court or buffet. Save your money and spend it else where."

You can instead buy a 24 oz tall-boy in a can of Miller Lite for $5. Also look around for beer specials, we could have bought 2 pitchers of PBR and had a 3rd free. The bartenders don't willingly inform you that their beer's a rip off. \n\nFood: another tip - don't eat it. It's just awful. We were a big group so I saw what all came out. Completely mediocre bordering on sketch. I got some awful thing with rice, a hamburger patty, eggs on top with gravy. The hamburger party and the gravy were nasty. The patty clearly comes to them shaped and frozen and when sliced into it looks like the most pathetic and low quality beef ever. Blarf.

Everything is way over priced! I had a burger and fries while my husband had the fish and chips. We also had two drinks. Our total bill was 90 dollars. Now I'm guessing you are mostly paying for the entertainment... They put the little funny hats on and you laugh a little and so on, but our waitress lacked a sense of humor and was hardly rude as she was suppose to be. Very plain Jane. Anyways the only true positive I have to say about this place is my dos Rita drink! Was actually really good. It was a large glass of margarita with a dos Equis inside. The atmosphere is fun, it's fun to read everyone's hat... My hat said \"blah blah blah stick it in my ass\" which is completely accurate lol!

However, there is a fine line between sarcasm, which I can deal with, and rudeness/disrespect.  I love sarcasm.  However, unless you know me really well, I can't deal with racial/ethnic humor.\n\nIn addition to the rudeness of the workers there, the prices are completely outrageous!  I had a pitcher of beer and was charged $19.  My pasta dish cost $15.  Are you serious?!?  I should've heeded our food server's advice and gone to McDonald's to order off their value menu.\n\nBottom line...DO NOT eat at this Dick's location unless you like to be overcharged for food/beer and like being treated with disrespect.

What's not to love?\n\nFor starters, I didn't love the anti-smoking policy. There were ashtrays everywhere just like there are everywhere else in Vegas. Apparently those are just decorations, though, and you have to stand outside the door to smoke a cigarette. I don't mind traveling to smoke, but it's beyond dickish to taunt smokers with ashtrays that can't be used.\n\nI also wasn't thrilled with the overall fun level at the Vegas Dick's. I went there on a Friday night and there was hardly anyone there. Our waiter didn't insult us, make fools of us, or even acknowledge us. That would normally be a good thing, but that's part of the fun you usually get to have at Dick's. \n\nEven though we were robbed of our consumer right to be mistreated, the Vegas Dick's gets brownie points for their awesome drinks. I had a 100 ounce slush chock full of grain alcohol in the coolest container ever. While others were walking around with Dick Sticks around their necks, I got to rock my drink with a plastic guitar around my shoulder. I always wanted my own personal drinking riff, so my rockin' guitar made up for a lot of Dick's shortcomings."

There's a sign warning people at the entrance so you really can't complain later if you can't take a joke. The chicken fingers really are very tender and delicious and not greasy. If you order the beer, you get a collectable cup to keep.

Drinks are expensive, of course.  But, there are lots of \"2 for 1\" coupons all over the place that help make up the difference.\n\nThe weekend is definitely the best time to go, as the crowd is usually pretty fun and the music being played is decent.  It's always a treat to see TACO, and how he interacts with \"special\" guests is priceless (brides-to-be, grooms-to-be, birthday girls and boys, etc).  They usually throw in a couple dance or singing parties, too, so that makes it fun.  And, honestly, the more sarcastic/rude you are with your server, the better the experience.

When I only had 2 bites my friend decided I was a wuss and went to give it a try... he spit it out. The only thing on our entire table that was worth eating were the wings.

Part of the hesitation was because we didn't know how good the food would be a the other part was a bit of fear of what our crazy hat would say. Going in with the expectation that they will be rude is good but for someone big on service and manners...I needed to remind myself a few times. \n\nTypical busy bar type scene but I loved the long picnic table type of seating. Our waitress was hilarious!! She was a petite, pretty, firecracker of a gal with a sharpe tongue.  Even though she was rude (at all the right times) our service was fast and we never wanted for anything. I loved the fact that the cups are massive as well. \n\nWe ordered several of the apps because they seemed large enough to share with the whole group. Everything was good. However the BBQ pulled pork nachos were AMAZING! I'm not just being dramatic, no. These things were awesome. To the point that when we got back home we attempted to recreate them ourselves several times; to no avail. The chocolate bar brownie was terrific too and it had a whole bar of chocolate just melted right on top of the brownie.  \n\nWe will be back and look forward to trying some of the other locations as well."

We were having a generally good time until my husband got up to use the restroom.  While I was sitting alone I yawned.  Upon seeing this a random male server made an offensive and racist remark about the size of my mouth/yawn and how it correlates with the color of my husbands skin.  The gentlemen sitting across from me were in just as much shock at the comment.  Needless to say I will not be returning.  \nLucky for that server I didn't share this with my husband until we were a safe distance from the casino."

What they wrote on the hats were creative and funny, but the waiter just seemed to be reading off his script in his mind, it was almost robotic. So the \"terrible\" \"experience\" was actually literally terrible. Maybe it was just our waiter, because the other tables seemed to be having fun with theirs, but he seemed to be bored. The food wasn't so-so, it was actually pretty horrible. I ordered the chicken breast, veggies, and rice, and it was simply just that. The chicken only had salt and pepper to taste, the veggies and rice were plain and simple. Very bland and our appetizers were unappealing. I'm glad I went because it satisfied my curiosity. But now I know that that frankly, well, I'd only eat here again if it was literally a last resort!"

First off I have to say if you have no sense of humor then don't eat here because at this restaurant the waiters are rude and crude and they make fun of you. They also let you make fun of them which is alot of fun. Then at the end of the meal you get these big paper hats that say funny things on them. Our waitress was so funny. When we first got there she threw our plasticware on the table and walked away. Then she came back and asked us if we decided yet and was telling us to hurry the hell up. She was making funny jokes and really had us laughing the entire time. She actually scared this Asian family out of there. I don't think they knew what the place was about and she was asking them if they spoke English and she told them to lighten up. They got up and walked out. I never laughed so hard in my life. When we had a legitimate question she went into waitress mode and answered it for us. This is the only restaurant where I told a waitress to bring me a damn to go box and it was ok. My husband told her to bring us the fucking check. It was a hoot. As far as the food goes I thought it was really good actually. I got the pulled pork plate and I loved it. My husband got the BBQ beef brisket and the ribs and he loved his also. The prices were good for Vegas. We all know anything in a Vegas casino is going to cost way more than it would anywhere else so I have different price standards for Vegas. This is by far the only redeeming quality the Excalibur has to offer and I will only return there to eat here."

So while you wait 45minutes to be seated, you have nothing to do but watch them wriggle their butts. \n\nThe food. It's pretty much disgusting. Not worth the price at all. I took one bite of my Buffalo Chicken sandwich and had to force my boyfriend to trade me for his brisket sandwich. I can usually put up with bad food, but this was beyond bad. It was dry, too bready, badly spiced or something, and the only thing I enjoyed were my french fries.\n\nThe only redeeming factors revolved around the atmosphere. Now I've been to the Dick's in San Diego, and the employees in Vegas, definitely take advantage of their location. They were raunchier and ruder, and definitely a lot more fun. Our waiter placed a paper hat that said \"douche-bag\", on our most drunk part member, which actually was spot on we discovered as our trip progressed. There was also a balloon-artist who made the most fantastic spider man hat for a little boy sitting at a table next to us. It was balloon spider man attached to a 1 foot balloon pole, attached to a circular hat piece. It was the most amazing balloon hat I've seen ever.\n\nProbably go again, if everyone else wanted to in my party, but definitely not if I had a big say in it."

The gimmick here is in the name - the staff act like dicks. They're rude, sarcastic, will flip you off and insult you regardless of age or gender. If you take stuff like that personally, just don't go. If you don't have a sense of humor - don't go. It's funny, irreverent, loaded with innuendo, and just...disrespectful. If you want standard service go somewhere else. If you want to get dickslapped, go to Dick's.\nOn to the review - the food here is pretty good for strip fare - I've had the pulled pork sandwich and tried the fried catfish and enjoyed both. The pulled pork sandwich was served with fries and was actually pretty daggone good. It's also slightly cheaper than their other sandwiches. The fried catfish here is the shiznaz! I honestly have to say this is about the best fried kittyfishy I've ever had, and I've spent my life in both Texas and Georgia so I've had a LOT of catfish. It's about $15 which is not a bad price for it, the fillets are big, the tartar sauce is good, and it's not greasy at all. The beer is cold and tasty, which is always a good thing. Beer which is warm and tasteless is swill (or being served in England)  and I flat refuse. If you order a tall beer (or have a friend who does anyway) you can keep the glass too (although it's usually made of plastic).\nThe main draw for me, though, week after week, is karaoke on the patio on Saturday and Sunday from 2 - 6, weather permitting. The queue is short, the selection vast, and the host is very good. Also, draughts and pitchers are 2 for 1, plus $5 shots of Jack or Jaeger during karaoke. If you like to sing, drink, or do both (like me) then go. If you have little ones, they can actually go with you. I actually saw the bartender put one of those paper hats they make on a 12 year old mentioning something about riding the short bus...laughed my ass off.\nBottom line - decent food and during karaoke decent drink specials.\n\nUpdate - the burgers are quite good too."

I was ready to be belittled and have horrible service and match wits against my server.  But instead, I got no service. At all.  The male host seated us at a table by the stage where a live band was playing.  The live band was great, and probably the main reason this review is getting one star (if zero were an option).  We were at our table for about 15 minutes and no one approached us... okay, so is that part of them being \"dicks?\"  Not sure, so we ordered our first round of drinks at the bar.  $20 for a \"pitcher\" of bud light... it was about half the size of any other pitcher I've ever seen.  $11 for a Jameson and coke.  $13 for a Red Bull and well vodka.  Ummm... is this fucking Tao?  The drink prices were outrageous!  I kinda thought maybe that was part of the \"joke\" here, but holy shit.  Make me a stupid hat that says I'm a whore and I'll laugh, but I find no humor in nightclub-like drink prices at this sort of establishment.  We remained at our table for an hour and a half, and eventually the SAME host who seated us came up and asked very rudely who sat us at the table.  And I don't mean rudely in a Dick's sort of way. I mean just plain rude. At this point we were over being neglected, so we headed out. My friend complained at the front about us getting no service and the host who seated was asking why he seated us where he sat us (you follow?).  The other host told us we shouldn't have been seated at the table we were at because the waiter in charge of that table went home sick.  So have another fucking waiter cover the table!  Every table around us was getting service.  How does that even make sense? And the solution the host offered us for our anger?  \"Come back tomorrow.\"  I really really really wanted to experience this place for what it was, but man was this shit.  I'm hoping this was just a rare fluke, but I'm also weary about going back because of the insanity of the drink prices."

As we were celebrating my nieces graduation from Arbor View High School we decided Dicks was the place to go, my sister figured our sixtyish parents would have a fun time. Indeed our party of 15 people had an amazing time. Non-stop laughs and smiles all the way around. Before we left my dad even got up shook the servers hand and said \"Thank you, I had a great time but I will never be back!\" As my parents are older in age and my dad is hard of hearing they don't go out much but they certainly had a blast there today! So thanks Dicks my parents will be talking about their visit to your restaurant for a while. Entertainment was amazing but the food is just ok."

It was succulent, full of flavor, and all the toppings were great. \n\nI ordered a small beer but got charged for and was given a large instead. I guess I wasn't bothered, but no way in hell I could finish it. \n\nMy waiter was cool. I knew I was in love with the idea of this place when he walked up and just threw the forks and knives onto the table and walked away.\n\nThat was pretty much it. I was here with my best friend and my parents, who are totally cool, but for some reason my mom was NOT having a good time (even though she very well knew what she was getting into) and was in a piss poor mood the entire time and made it awkward. I think the waiter picked up on it, so he wasn't ever around, so I didn't really get the experience.\n\nThe only thing was that he walked up right as I had just started looking at the menu and asked if everyone was ready. I kind of looked up and he said, \"Or I can come back, you know. I have other shit to do.\" which, of course, tickled my funny bone.\n\nOther than that, like I said, literally no interaction. I did get a hat, but no talkin'-to or anything. If I had come here with just my friend, or even my dad, I'm sure we would have had a hell of a good time. \n\nMy advice is if anyone in your party is not sure if they want to come here, DON'T BRING THEM or go somewhere else! Only go if you really, REALLY know you want to."

The Vegas location tries too hard to be over the top. The way I describe it to my friends is that San Diego developed their style while Vegas hit the ground running and I don't mean that in a good way for Vegas. Anthony, the bartender in San Diego, knows his audience and tailors his \"rudeness\" accordingly. Vegas is like one size fits all. Guess what, it doesn't. And maybe it's the layout. San Diego is one huge rectangle of an old warehouse. You can read the menu on the wall from almost anyplace you sit and if you can't guess what, there's a menu right in front of you. I even had a waitress write a menu in chalk on the ground in front of me. Here I've had to get up in order to read a menu that you can't read because there is a post or a wall in the way. Oh, yeah. I had a party of 20 set up for a birthday party here in Vegas. Even though I had reservation at 6:00 We weren't allowed to sit until \"all\" not most of our party arrived. This wasn't until almost 7. I don't think  that if I'm about to drop several hundred bucks on a joint I shouldn't have to wait an hour becasue three people showed up late.\n\nVegas do yourself a favor and check out San Diego.\nThat'll show you the difference between a 2 star and 4 star review."

Our table was a little more timid than some of the other tables, I was the only one who got a drink -- everyone else waters, and I think that's why the guy didn't really pay much attention to us throughout the night. The other tables who were talking back and such got a little more of the experience.\n\nThe food was just ok, I had the Ribs and Chicken which came with fries for around $18. I can't say much about the food, I mean it was a decent portion but seasoning wise it was nothing special and it kind of just felt like we were eating in some cafeteria.\n\nNeedless to say, the food may not be great but its worth it to come here at least once for the experience, come to have fun and talk back to your server, 3 stars since it's worth trying once."

The portion sizes were on the small side. They force you to buy the jug they bring your drink in at an added cost (not a huge cost but really?).

Stick with appetizers and alcohol-or maybe just the alcohol-here, because if you're lookin' for tasty, gourmet Las Vegas food, you're better off elsewhere. It's a dim bar/restaurant with plenty of TVs and tables and benches and chairs. The appeal here is to be treated like dicks by dicks.\n\nI've been here twice during two separate trips to Vegas: once for convenience ( I was with a bachelorette and other girls who wanted to eat dinner here before watching Excalibur's 'Thunder From Down Under' show upstairs) and another time for 'the experience.' \n\nThe employees act like dicks, making sometimes funny and sometimes corny but all the time off the wall jokes to passer bys, potential customers, and actual customers. That's what you come here for! The service is slow-ish. Your waiter/waitress will analyze you and put a paper hat on your head boasting some seemingly personal, blatant, sharpie-written insight. I did like their fortune cookies. I only got one cause I'm part Asian (the two Mexican girls with me didn't get 'em). Cute.\n\nMy first time @ DICK's, I didn't get dunced by their dunce cap; but the second time I got the hat. My \"ombr\u00e9\" hair was apparently faux pas and not up to par w/ my waitress's standards. What a dick!"

It was a football Sunday and the sports book was super crowded so we stopped in here to get some food and drinks while watching ten football games at once.\n\nOur server was pretty cool.  He brought paper for the tablecloth and threw napkins in our direction.  Yep they do have attitude here and any customer who can throw had better be ready to get it back.  They also do those paper hats with funny sayings on there.  They no longer have menus but a menu posted on the wall.  Those who are too far have to walk over to the wall to read it...any other place this sort of thing wouldn't do...but here at Dick's...hilarious!\n\nOne good redeeming thing about the food is their onion rings.  They were perfectly cooked with the right amount of crispiness.  Whoever did that batch, I bow to your skill.  The brisket sandwich I got was OK and the chicken tenders and fries that my friend got was not so hot.  Did I mention that most of this food was $12 and up?  $14 for chicken strips and fries?  Ridiculous!  AND, the beer selection has magically shrank since I last came here.  They used to have over 15 types of beer on tap here now all they got are the sad macrobrews that the gamblers get served outside plus Blue Moon(ran out that day) and Guinness.  I got a Guinness from them and it set me back $14!  Beer pricing also not shown when I ordered.\n\nI don't think I can describe how disappointed I am with all this Dick's has gone downhill since I was last here.  Please bring back the draft beer selection like Newcastle, Sam Adams, or Anchor Steam.  People come into your restaurant to have drinks that they can't get while gambling so if you have overpriced food plus minimal beer selection, then that's a recipe for disaster."

I have food allergies, so it's never a fun surprise to get served something I can't eat and those descriptions could have made our experience better. We shared a crab cake dinner. The crab cakes were the only thing I could eat with that meal. They were ok, not a lot of flavor, no sauce....some sriracha mayo could have done wonders but there was none. I found a piece of shell in mine, which I figured was good because it at least means the crab wasn't imitation krab. I give this place three stars because one positive note was they are generous with the booze in their pina coladas. If I ever return I think I'll skip the food and just order a drink from the bar."

So what it's fun, you know what you are getting into when you walk thru the door. The staff are actually quite nice and funny. \nI judge bar food by its wings, and trust me I have had some sub-par wings in my day, I rose that back I have had some bone fide dreadful wings in my day, wings so bad that I had to run home assume the prenatal position and turn the electric blanket up to 10! Thank goodness for Dicks these wings were great! I drank a PBR tall boy ($5 Happy hour) out of the can I felt so dirty, but I will live!  Well worth a stop in, unless you like paying $17 for a beer.

We sat down, the server came over and threw a paper table cover at us.  We adjusted it and began looking at the menu.  Looking around the portions seemed large, so we decided to share.  After the server took our order, he gave me a hat and then brought my Mom one.  Once they threw the plates down and walked away, we realized there was no BBQ sauce on the brisket but we couldn't catch the server's attention to ask for more.  When he did come by, I asked where the hats were for the other 2 people at our table and he yelled, \"don't tell me how to do my job\" and walked away.  Never received any refills on our drinks or anything else at our table.  In fact, I had to find forks for us in order to eat.  The bill came out with a note \"suck it\" and the server asked us to leave a big tip.  Then he proceeded to advise we had to leave cash because their credit machine was down.  I understand the place is called Dick's and I understand it's supposed to be fun and obnoxious.  But we had horrible service.  The food was good.  We only left a 15% tip.

I've been wanting to check out Dicks for a long time but never had the chance while I was in Vegas.  I'll just go over the major awful points.  There will not be a good point section because there are no good points that go along with the story.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: \nHands down the worst.  The place was pretty full (not 100% full) - I've seen it busier.  I asked the hostess if they had any tables available and was told no but that I can sit at the bar if we like.  I asked her if the experience was still the same - she told me that everyone still gets picked on and gets the funny hat and the experience they pay for.  With her assurance I accepted a seat at the bar for my mother and I.  \n\nOur blonde waitress was also the bar tender.  She was not super friendly at first but she also wasn't horrible.  She got our drinks and took our food orders in a semi-efficient manner and that was that.  We were left in the corner of the bar with another group of patrons to eat our food and watch the entire restaurant have a great time with the staff while we were ignored.  Several other waiters walked by us but didn't even bother saying Hi.  \n\nTowards the end of our dining experience (over an HOUR) into it.  We asked about the hats.  The bar tender/waitress got really mad and told me she \"is very busy and doesn't have time to deal with hats\" and walked away.  WOW.  For the first time in my life I left a big fat $0.00 on the tip line.\n\nFOOD:\nNot awesome or unique or even flavorful in anyway.  My mother got the fish and chips which were soggy and a bit cold and I got a burger which tasted like any other burger, in any other restaurant in the country.  My 1st bottled beer was not ice cold.  The 2nd one (draft in a Dicks cup) was better and my mother's Huge margarita was good.  I would not willingly pay for the food again.\n\nATMOSPHERE: \nIts horribly loud.  I expected it to be loud.  But it was so loud that I had to yell in my mom's ear while sitting right next to her to have any kind of conversation.  If I had a fun waiter and we were getting fun hats and I was tipsy and fun then I would have loved the atmosphere.  But none of those things happened.\n\nVALUE:\nDo I even have to talk about this?  In the end we paid $72.00 for a bland burger, soggy fish and chips, two beers and a margarita.  You walk into a place like this and expect to pay big time for what the place has to offer that is unique. We didn't get any of that.  I will never go back and will never recommend this place to anyone else.  It will actually even push me from staying at the Excalibur because I like to eat where I am staying at least one day during my Vegas vacations.  STAY AWAY and spend your money elsewhere.\n\nI told the hostess about the problems we had afterwards.  She didn't apologize and didn't even ask if we wanted to talk to a manager.  Nice."

It did not work that time, but I made sure it was in the schedule this time and I was not disappointed. \n\nThe food was better than a lot of reviews made me believe. And, even not being a fan of pickles, I enjoyed the fried pickles. The fries were perfectly seasoned and the burger was huge (I couldn't even eat it all).\n\nThe atmosphere was amazing too! I love the picnic feel of that place. Seating by people you do not know and laughing with them just makes for an amazing time. It really makes for the environment. And yes, the wait staff are dicks (at least most of them) but that is the name of the game. It is just a fun time. \n\nThe price wasn't bad. I estimated about $65 dollars for the meal for two and it ended up being about $70 in total (including a tip) which I figure is average for Vegas, especially when you add in the cost of the huge goblet one that is big enough for two.\n\nAll in all, it was an awesome time and I loved it!"

We ate a hamburger and chicken nuggets (like we are at a kids restaurant). The food is worse than Mcdonalds. My bf's hamburger tasted as if it was cooked in the microwave. Very limited selection on the menu that is EXTREMELY over priced nasty bar food. The more I think of the concept the more stupid I think is to actually pay someone to be an asshole to you. Save your money go eat somewhere nice that actually has decent food and go to that show you always wanted to go to. I will never return to this ridiculous place."

Half our table wanted to get up and leave but we stayed as anywhere we went we would have had to wait and we were hungry.  When she came back with drinks my husband took her aside and explained that she was not being entertaining but rude because we were about 50 in before we got drinks which is BAD service in our book.  She apologized to the table and we stayed.\n\nThe food is only ok and way over priced.\n\nI think her problem was that we were being sarcastic back and trying to have fun with her and she didn't like it.

It's brilliant on their part.  Customers think its a cute theme, when it's really just being lazy.  For example, instead of printed menus, they just have a handwritten list of food taped to the wall.\n\nWe wandered in here in the afternoon right after checking into the Excalibur.  We were looking for a chill place to grab a snack and get our bearings.  We were not looking for Dick's.  The waiters grunt at you, point in answer to questions, wander off, and go out of their way not to be rude.  We ordered nachos, which were fine, although they skimped on the toppings so half the chips went uneaten.\n\nWhat I really didn't like about Dick's was the 'entertainment.'  After making stupid paper hats for some of the customers, the waiters took multiple packs of napkins and tossed them all over the restaurant, the food and into the drinks.  I know the waiter thought my pissed off look was due to him balling up a napkin and hitting me in the eye with it, but he was wrong.  I got that it was all a part of the 'ambiance' of Dicks.  \n\nWhat pissed me off was to see the wanton waste of trees that must happen countless times a day in this place for the sake of pretending to be jerks.  I even recycle my toilet paper rolls at home.  Just thinking about all my little daily efforts to do what's right by the environment and how in the course of a month Dick's crass wastefulness probably offsets the efforts I make all year really pissed me off.  I didn't care about getting winged in the eye with a ball of paper.  I was already done with Dick's and ready to go."

I got a funny hat as did my girlfriend.  Everything great so far. \nThe food was mediocre at best, about on par with Denny's. (I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got a Philly cheesesteak.)  We decided to get a drink from the bar to share in souvenir cup: $27.  We had a coupon for free fried pickles that we used - they were quite salty, but still pretty good.\nThen I decided to give back some of the insults I was getting, so I wrote on the table with ketchup, \"IF MY WAITRESS SUCKED HARDER I'D ORGASM.\" As soon as she saw it she said that she could legally charge me for that, so I simply held out my hand for the bill. Sure enough, she added on $4.99 for \"add chicken\" that I never ordered. Thankfully she took off the charge for the fried pickles, but only after I reminded her to. After she saw the table message, her attitude changed. No insults, no talk back, she became cold and distant and dealt with us very little, only as long as was needed to handle our immediate requests. \"Maybe she was busy with other customers,\" you might say. Yes, she was busy interacting a lot with other customers in the way she is supposed to, but not with us.\nNow, I understand that ketchup on the table is mess to clean up, but I wrote it on the DISPOSABLE PAPER table cover - the mess can be simply picked up and thrown away. Even if she claimed that the ketchup would seep through the paper, so would any other grease, oil, accidentally spilled drink, and any other wet thing that got on the table cover during the normal course of a meal, so there is effectively no difference - she'd have to clean it anyway.  If she claimed that I used too much ketchup, what would she say to anyone who simply likes ketchup or some other condiment? Would she actually charge extra money to patrons for using too much mustard, or salt, or pepper? What if I had accidentally dropped and spilled it? Also, a 32 oz. bottle of ketchup from Walmart costs $2.82, and I believe that restaurants buy such things for less because they buy in bulk. Perhaps she was insulted by my comment. Understandable. But, how could she work in a place where the shtick is to insult patrons yet be unable to tolerate insults tossed back at her?\nSo, like I started with, $5 I didn't need to pay. That was BS. So I took it out of her tip. Your welcome, waitress, for me giving you anything other than a rude gesture for a tip."

First the hostess seated us at the bar, claiming the server for tables was overbooked, not ideal, but fine. The bartender asked, \"What do you want, something stupid?\" to which, with a good sense of humor, we replied just a food menu. He threw the menus at us and immediately asked, \"what the hell do you want to drink?\" Already I could tell this place wasn't for me, but I was willing to roll with it. I said I needed just a minute to decide on a drink when the bartender said, \"well I'm just going to stand here and stare at you until you can stop being such an idiot.\" I was annoyed and murmured something to my boyfriend, when the bartender made another comment that if I had something to say I should say it to his face. At this point I was ready to walk out, I get it's an act they're told to put on, but I'm a paying customer, give me a minute to figure out my drink order, alright? The line was crossed for me though when another couple walked in, and after waiting for a few minutes without being acknowledged by anyone (the restaurant was empty) approached the bartender and asked if they should just seat themselves. At this point he said \"Uh no. The sign clearly says wait to be seated,\" then turned to us and said \"that's as polite as I can be when you're being a complete f---ing moron.\" Totally over the line and inappropriate. If I'm going to be treated like crap, I'm not going to pay for it. Especially at an overpriced, mediocre restaurant.\n\nUnless this experience sounds like an enjoyable time that you're willing to pay for, avoid this restaurant."

She was a major dick but still tended to our needs like one would expect in a restaurant. \n\nThe menu was very overwhelming to me... Three separate sheets! But she went over it quickly and got us familiar with the items and made a few recommendations. (Here's a tip: don't get the chicken strips! Ha!) \n\nWe were seated instantly on a busy Thursday evening, quickly greeted, drinks seemed to come to our table as soon as we ordered them, and the food quickly followed. One person in my party was a huge dick, while one was super shy. Christine went full force on our party's \"dick\" and kept it a bit calmer for our shy friend. She really wanted to make sure we all had a good time. \n\nI ordered a burger but I realize I should have followed Christine's advice and gotten something more BBQ themed because my friend's pulled pork was amazing. \n\nI would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Las Vegas again.

It is probably the most unique restaurant concept I have ever seen - a bold experiment in hospitality, wherein the servers are hired based on their natural capacity to be surly and obnoxious and say absolutely whatever they feel like to their patrons.  \n\nHere is a slice of the conversation that occurred while I was ordering:\n\nMe: \"I will have...hmmm....just give me one sec\"\nHer: \"Hurry the f%$k up.  I need to take other orders.\"\nMe: \"OK, sheesh, how's this salad?\"\nHer: \"Not bad, if you're a p&ssy.  I'll put you down for a steak.\"\nMe: \"Um, thanks but I don't want the steak.  I want the salad.\"\nHer: (rolls eyes, goes to the next person) \"And what the f@#k do YOU want?\"\n\nI'm not sure how you would like being involved in the above ordering process, but I have to say, I found it refreshing.  Even though I'm a huge fan of great service at restaurants, in life you so rarely encounter someone who is speaking their mind with such utter abandon, that experiencing it is a true novelty.  \n\nDo not come here with someone who is easily offended or insecure.  But if you can appreciate being ragged on the whole time you eat and maybe dish it right back to them too, you will have a huge amount of laughs, and memories, on the other side."

The bf got a margarita on the rocks, I opted for a cranberry and vodka. If you know me, you know I love me some Vodka, but I seriously couldn't even drink it, the vodka tasted nasty.

Yes I know this is supposed to be a place where the service is supposed to be bad and the server is supposed to be sarcastic and what not but it was worse than that. They have a sign of what the servers are supposed to be and what they won't be, which you'll see at the entrance. Everything they said he wouldn't be, he was. Being vulgar, sexually explicit, rude, mean and nasty. All which are on the \"they will not be\" list. He wrote on those hats some really sexually explicit things that if you were trying to genuinely insult someone they would be funny, but when you're just trying to have fun it shouldn't be said. Because of this place I probably will not step foot in Excalibur again. Hopefully Excalibur can get rid of this place and put a better restaurant in there, until then I won't be going back to that hotel."

Like not throwing knives or fork ( they don't do that). Like throwing napkins up in the air while being colorful. The writing is very creative for the hats. Food was worth it. 9/10"

Our server Connie was amazing and very attentive and halarious with a sharp tongue and oh so quick with the witty comebacks at the same time! Definitely don't go if you don't have a sense of humor and a thick skin. The food was good but if I lived in Las Vegas I would go back just to have Connie as our server again. So if you are reading this and thinking of going here to eat, definitely ask to be seating in her section!"

The sign said, \"Warning, staff has been trained to be sarcastic, rowdy, naughty, honry, and colorful. I figured yeah okay everybody is that way. What caught me off guard was the extent that our waitress took it to. She didn't get no more than 10 words out of her mouth before I really felt the urge to fire back. Some of the things that she was saying I would only expect to hear from people that I've known for a long time. After taking a deep breath and thinking of the situation that I was in, I finally realized that what she was doing was part of the show. Though I was getting used to it, I still found myself wanting to jump every time she opened her mouth.\n The overall feel of the place is like a party place. Everybody was having a good time.\nFood was prepared exactly as ordered and served hot. The flavor was bland.\n The cost of the entrees were not that far out of line considering this is the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered a tequila and orange juice with two add shots and it nearly floored me when I saw how much it cost me. $37.00 for one drink. I could have almost bought two dinners for the cost of that one drink.\n This is one of those places that I will only go to one time and I would have difficulty recommending it to other people."
