Pretty darn awesome.\n2. pineapple fried rice- addictive!\n3. pad thai- a tad sweet but still tasty\n4. house curry- not as rich as other curries but still alright\n\nLarge portions, good service, reasonable prices. I'd come again."

I had the silver noodle soup with pork to start...the ingredients so fresh and tasty seriously one of the best soups I have ever had..anywhere! I had the yellow curry with chicken also excellent. I asked for 3 on the heat and omg it was spicey lol..be careful what level you ask for....service was outstanding and pleasant. It is always a pleasure to write a great review....if they deserve it they get it and this place definitely showed that my first visit was a flook...without a doubt will return to this restaurant."

Ill keep asking the waitress every 30 mins where's my order & waiting for almost 1hour & 30mins. Just find out that they forgot my order & missed up. Not even apologizing there mistake from the start & never even offer any discount or even just a decent apology for there mistake. Im not happy. I'm very disappointed and upset!!! Sad to say...been spending a lot of money here for almost 6times every month to dine-in with friends & take out order. This is was a worst experience I had with this restaurant. Never come back here again!"

The other location was a definitive 5 stars. \nCurry fried rice w/ pork- 3 stars. The other location was also a definite 5-stars. \nStuffed chicken wings- 3 stars. It was good. \n\nI'll be heading over to the other location to get my Archie's grub on. But, I'd say it is one of the best Thai food in town from my experience at other location."

Too bad it was closed but this couldnt have worked out better as a vast majority of people leaving their parked cars were migrating toward Archi's.\n\nShapow man ordered a beef salad which came real quick. My red curry lunch special took it's sweet time but what lacked in readily available made up in mmmm mmmm good.\n\nThe soup that is included with the lunch special was kind of a thai american fusion. It was chicken soup but was thickened and egg dropped. Thick cuts of onion, carrot slivers, and celery with decent sized slices of chicken white meat.\n\nI was overall impressed with the red curry. Medium wasnt quite as spicy as i was expecting ordering a medium but it had a very pleasant creaminess from the coconut milk. Lots of bamboo shoots which i love. Salad was perfectly dressed with a thickened fish sauce (i think) based dressing. Overall everything on that plate was friggin good.\n\nTotal damage done between an order of the red curry lunch special, a beef salad, and a cranberry juice: 21.49\n\nWait....what? the total damage rung up to twenty one fiddy?? Oh hells no i'm bout to come back a few more times."

            "review": "We are frequent diners at both of Archi's locations. We use this one if we plan on seeing a movie. \n\nOur experience today will make us never come to this location again. We were seated promptly in their new section against the windows. We waited for 5 minutes before someone even approached out table. We ordered drinks and waited to have someone take our food order. Another 5 minutes. We didn't get anything crazy - 1 order of Thai egg rolls and 2 plates of Pad Thai. This took a little longer than usual but they were busy so it was understandable. However, we were only approached once for a refill and that's it. \n\nWhen I say that's it, I mean WE HAD NO MORE SERVICE. No one came to check on us again, no one asked if we needed to go boxes, no one asked if we were done and ready for our check. I tried flagging down our waitress since we were trying to get to our movie to no avail. Finally, my boyfriend left to purchase our tickets thinking I would be ready to go by the time he got back. Nope. He actually had to ask for our check and a box at the hostess stand. What a horrible experience. I felt bad for the people who got seated 2 tables down from us who had to wait 15 minutes to be approached. However, the people who came in 10 minutes after us and ordered, ate, and left 10 minutes before us (ordering more food AND getting refills and checked up on) maybe you could give the rest of us some advice on how to handle this place."

I had the pad thai which I usually get at a Thai restaurant I've never been to before since pad thai is my benchmark of the eatery's cooking.  It was ok.  Restaurant decor was nice and service friendly.  \n\nThis was the second Archi's restaurant I've tried and I think I'll stick with the single store, mom & pop Thai eateries.  Actually, we only ate at this Archi's because the line to Bachi Burger was too long.  I would rate this Archi's 4-stars had I been there for a weekday lunch special.  As it was, with it's weekend menu pricing, the place was ok."

We ordered Spicy Basil (spicy level 3 is perfect, it's spicy enough that you can still taste the flavor) and the Panang (it is curry with a pinch of awesomeness).\n\nThis location, W Sahara and Ft Apache, is good if you are not in a rush. The staff is friendly but you will have to wait alot to get your drinks, to order your food, to get your food, to get your bill.... So on, you get the picture. This is why I give them a 4 stars.\n\nOtherwise, the food is amaaaaazing and it is perfect location for a date nite (right next door to a theater!)."

We were quickly led to a table in the back corner and given two menus, great! I start looking at the menu but soon notice no one has passed by to ask us for our drink order. I look up at another table that had came in after us and noticed they had already received their drinks. Annoyed with this drink situation, my boyfriend starts looking around and then a male worker comes up to ask us if anyone has taken our drink order. We respond no and he asks us what we want.... okay, everything is fine. While we are at it my boyfriend asks for some crispy wontons..... the waiter says \"I'm not your waiter\".... ummm k......so he leaves and then two minutes later another girl comes by asking our drink order. We explained someone had stopped by already. This waiter theme continues throughout the night, literally 3-4 different waiters stopped by dropping things off at our table or to ask us something. Also, why is everything placed in the corner far away from the customer? Lol, I don't mind reaching, I just don't understand. In the end, we ate our food, it was great! I just didn't particularly like the service per say."

Just seeing Archi's grow with two more locations all on my side of town not only makes it more accessible. I love seeing non franchise chains or that small family style run restaurant succeed. The thing about success and growing more restaurants is will the consistency be there at ALL locations. I can honestly say before I tried this location the one on rainbow my go to since closest to home. The food has been just as awesome, amazing, and on point every time. I am huge fan of the lunch specials! I also come lot for dinner with my brother family. I have never had bad dish on the menu. Some of my favorite are the spicy basil, any of the curry, and really can go on and on. Just ry it if never had Archi's. \n\nThis location it right next to the movie theater so makes for perfect before movie or after movie spot. Honestly that shopping center almost ridiculous amount of quality and assortment of food can get not just Thai food. Leave that for another review. Lol! \n\nTwo things that stood out for me came to this location versus the others. I felt like the lunch special portion was twice the size compare the rainbow location. I would order the same thing spicy basil with ground chicken. Swear the spicy basil was twice the size. The plate was full full compare to rainbow location everything looked nicely portion size. Just overflowing almost. Thumbs up for me!!! The dining area might be the same size as rainbow location but feel like bigger again maybe double in size. Fair the set up lot more different. The dining room has high ceilings compare to the rainbow location. Upfront almost like dining room next to dining room. Not as loud so comes lunch time or busy no need to shout out conversations. The tables not literally next to one another then rainbow location. The decor like definitely know walking into Thai restaurant. The service feel like they stop by more often check up on you. I went right around prime lunch hour and not as busy as rainbow location. \n\nOverall Archi's is my five star Thai hands down. Just happy not only do they have multiple locations but knowing that get the same great food at each one. Five star all on its own. Consistency..."

Food was still great so the cooks know what they are doing, but the service not so much.\n\nI ordered the lunch Pad Thai and a side of plain rice noodles for my one and half year old (didn't see any children's menu or offered a separate children's menu). \n\nSoup it came with was good. They brought out a bowl of rice which I thought came with lunch, and my food a bit later.\n\nNo noodles for the baby. Had to ask about 5 minutes into my own meal all the while trying to keep me quiet by giving him the rice which he just threw on the floor.\n\nThe baby started to fuss toward the end of the meal so I handed them my CC so we could get out of their quickly. When I got it and bill I noticed they had charged me for the rice, which I never asked for. Not wanting to flag them down and reverse the transaction I signed their copy and made a note on the itemized copy about the overcharge. \n\nBecause this place doesn't seem family friendly I will not be coming here on a regular basis. Maybe once in and blue moon for dinner when we have a sitter, but even that will be rare. In the meantime, I will be looking for another thai place that meets my expectations."

Our drinks were filled at all times, and we never went without anything we could need or want. \n\nThe prices were fair (really good lunch specials during the week, but we were there on a weekend). \n\nI think this is standard everywhere, but it still bugged me that we weren't able to just pay a little extra to upgrade to brown rice (we had to get the steamed rice that came with the meals and then pay for a huge side of brown rice). If that's my only real complaint about this terrific restaurant then I know I'll be back (but only when I have to be on this side of town). \n\nThere's something so exciting about stumbling in to a new place and being totally blown away by it.

            "review": "So Archi's turned out to be a hidden gem after going there for the first time, I thought the food was decent but not spicy as I had ordered. I LOVE spicy food- the hotter, the better. I know most people think they like spicy food and when you give them a mildly hot dish they start crying like a baby. Which is why I always order my dishes at the highest spice level a restaurant serves. And so, my first visit to Archi's I did as such and was disappointed by the lack of heat. I mentally crossed them off my checklist of my favorite Thai spots....  A month later I was craving Thai and Archi's is literally a block from my house so I gave them another try. After the first 5 bites of food, I was breathing FIRE!! I couldn't believe the extreme turn around of spiciness level and I absolutely loved it! \n\nArchi's has now become one of my top favorite Thai places and I know I can count on them to live up to my expectations. I work in a smoky bar and when I get home from work I usually feel sick to my stomach from breathing in second-hand smoke all day. The Tom Yum with chicken (level 10) always does the trick to make me feel better or cure a hangover. I also LOVE the Pad Pak w/chicken (lot's of delicious veggies with choice of meat), Garlic Pepper Chicken, and Red Curry. The only think I don't care for is the Pad Thai at this place. It's reddish orange for some reason....??"

So we decided to try this place instead.  Fortunately, we had no wait time.  There was one table just waiting for our party of 4.  The ambiance was relaxing, and the restaurant was nicely decorated.  Staff was attentive without being intrusive, and the food came out quickly.\n\nSo, this is what we ordered and shared.  Beef Pad see ew for $8.95, ginger ginger ginger chicken for $9.95, spicy chicken basil fried rice for $9.95, green curry chicken for $9.95, and Thai iced tea for $3.95.  Everything tasted fine.  Not outstanding, but above average.  \n\nLas Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from.  If I was in the area craving Thai food, I would certainly drop by here again.  If I was not in the area, then I would not come all the way here to eat.\n\nOverall though, Archi's Thai Cafe is a good spot to eat.  If they were in my hometown, I'd rate them 4 stars.  In Vegas, though, because of all the choices out there....I can only give them 3 stars."

A good amount of space between tables. The waitress and servers were nice and attentive.\n\n- the drunken noodles was delicious. I usually order this in most Thai restaurants and this is probably the best I have had in Vegas (so far). I personally don't like Thai food that is towards the sweet side, and this was definitely very savory with a nice light basil flavor. There were lots of vegetables like mushrooms, baby corn, and green beans. The spice level was up there, so if you don't like spicy food, I recommend ordering much below a 6.\n\n- spicy basil with pork was an above average dish. It came with a tiny bowl of rice. With all of the sauce, I was hoping there would be more rice. The dish comes with ground meat, and we requested sliced pork instead and they accommodated us without any problems. There is a soy sauce, basil, stir fry flavor. I would probably try something else off the menu next time.\n\nAll in all - good place to eat with a convenient location next to the movie theater."

Best Pad Kea Mow I have ever had.\n\nTom Yum Soup - Sometime I will get this as an light appetizer before my main entree, but  be careful they make this REALLY spicy so get a low number for spice.\n\nPad Thai - always a winner.\n\nI also really like the red and green curries, pineapple fried rice, pad prik king, spicy basil and rad nar. \n\nThe service here is usually pretty good and the servers are attentive.

While it's not the place I go most often for Thai food, it's the place I go when I want a decent assortment of dishes on the menu and Thai food prepared consistently well.  There's enough variety there to satisfy what you're looking for most of the time:  appetizers, salads, soups, entrees (including curry and noodle dishes) and desserts.  I've eaten at the W. Sahara restaurant, and Rainbow Blvd. restaurant and found the food and service to be consistently good at both.\n\nLunch portions are almost as big as the dinner portions and include an egg roll and small soup.  They're definitely worth choosing from during the lunch hour.\n\nDinner is always delicious.  For those who enjoy Thai food, you'll see many of your usual favorites there.  If you're new to this variety of Asian cuisine, consider adding your choice of meat to the Pad Thai (everyone seems to love this dish), Pad Se Ew, Pad Prik Pow, or Broccoli.    If you're in the mood for curry, there are eight dishes to chose from and they're all good.  If you'd rather go with soup, I highly recommend Tom Yum or Tom Kha.  (Tom Kha is essentially Tom Yum but with coconut milk added to make the soup creamier rather than brothy.)\n\nI prefer the fried Egg Rolls (they're served warm, right out of the fryer) rather than the fresh Spring Rolls (served cold).  And if you've never tried one, don't forget to treat yourself to a Thai Iced Tea.  They're almost too sweet for me, but they still taste fantastic.  It's almost like a liquid dessert.\n\nFinally, like with most Thai restaurants, you can dial the spiciness up or down.  The waitstaff will ask, so go conservative if you're a little nervous and dial up from there.  You'll start to feel the heat with anything above a moderate level, and if you're adventurous, go for \"Thai hot\".  (But you better like spicy food.)\n\nParking (at the Sahara location) is ample since the restaurant is located in a storefront.  When you enter the parking lot, look for the Regal Cinema.  Archi's is to the right."

Came here for a late lunch with friends. There were a handful of other people in the restaurant. Service was ok, the waitresses were mostly attentive but there were long gaps between water refills. Other than that, the waitresses were nice.\n\nWhat really made me happy I tried Archi's Cafe was that their spice level is actually SPICY! Their scale is 1-10 (like Pin Kaow and other thai restaurants) but ordering a 9 here, felt like a real level 9! \n\nIt was spicy, my lips were on fire halfway through my plate of veggie pad thai and I was in heaven. I consistently order spicy level 10 at other thai restaurants and it's hot but not truly spicy. Archi's did that for me."

Overall one of the better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. It is clean and easy to find and very convenient if you live in or near Summerlin. \n\nOne area of constructive criticism since I do eat here often with the family: I would say is the customer service needs to be improved drastically since this is the only area that has a lot of room for improvement since their food is very good. It is not bad by any means, but they often appear disorganized. Some servers are better than others. Specifically, when lines start to form the given estimated times are more like guesses and substantially differ depending on who passing by at the front. It appears that having a hostess at the front at all times (during the peak times) would be a quick fix."

But I've been trying to get over my fears and one day we decided to venture outside of the usual. Our newest discovery was the Papaya Salad. Shredded Papaya with a sweet chili flavor type sauce and leaves of lettuce. My husband loves spicy food, so he gets (from a scale of 1-10) a 6, as for me, I am a fricking wimp when it comes to heat in my food so, I usually have a few bites and eat the crap out of the lettuce since it's mostly water and it's super refreshing! \n\nOther than the Papaya Salad, the food is like any other Thai restaurant and can assist with any fix that you're looking to get for Thai food. The thing that differentiates Archi's from other Thai restaurant is the fact that they pay attention to detail through service and presentation. Pure white plates and carved garnishes are usually small indicators that they care about- presentation. The decor of the restaurant is very modernized. Walking towards Archi's the first time, you'd assume that the place was as plain as the exterior of the restaurant... Not at all true. \n\nBoo! No refills on Thai Ice Tea!! Some restaurants refill, some don't and Archi's does not. That's the only reason why I knocked one star off."

There were thee brown hard circles, chicken, something that looked like lettuce or cabbage, green onions (I think) and carrots. I wasnt impressed. Then our main dish came out. The Pad Thai was a little too spicy for my liking and way to peanuty. I ended up only eating the wonton and egg roll and having to order a whole other meal. That was annoying. I ordered the fried rice in place of the Pad Thai and it was amazing. Thats what I go to Archi's for in the first place.

Kudos!\n\nWe started with Tom Kha, and it was up there with the best we've ever had, loaded with white meat chicken and lots of flavor.  How did it know it would be just what the doctor ordered for the flu I'd come down with the next day?\n\nFor once, I managed to convince Herb to let me take a break from our chicken-infused life, and we ordered the Garlic Pepper Shrimp.  I was in heaven!  It was delicious, and had a good-sized helping of the elusive (at least in my culinary world) crustaceans.  I even convinced him to eat a few, since there were too many for me.  That's because there was yet another chicken dish to dig into.\n\nCountry Curry (with chicken, natch) wasn't as successful.  It was okay, but a little too bland, though we'd ordered it medium.  The waitress took it back to the kitchen for an additional helping of hot stuff, and it was vastly improved.  We've been a little skittish ever since going to Australia and learning what REAL Thai \"medium\" is like, i.e., smoke pouring out of your ears, so AmeriThai medium turns out to be not spicy enough too often.  \n\nService was excellent, and even though we got there late and were the last people to leave the restaurant, we didn't feel rushed.  \n\nI'm looking forward to trying some of the other dishes on Archi's menu, and maybe even one of the other locations."

I ordered the fried wonton's as an appetizer. For my main lunch, I ordered the Pad See Ew, and it reminded me of my mama's cooking! \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and was quick to take our orders (even though it was quite busy that afternoon).

I even checked out the website a few times. Finally, we got the chance today for lunch. We are not on this side of town much, though it's not too long of a stretch (just one street). We watched a movie, caught a matinee bright and early, the first showing. It was noon. There were quite a few diners but it is spacious, so it didn't feel crowded.\n\nThe ambiance is very elegant and pretty, with many dark rich solid wood pieces of furniture, giving you the feel of being in a resort lobby---it is one of the prettiest thai restaurants around. I thought they were for show but they were functional. The decor on the walls were simple (silk greenery variety) and ornate (wrought iron looking, rectangular-shaped). Seating is mainly chairs and tables with some bench seating. There were touches of alters but nothing large (or gawdy, for that matter). The kitchen is well concealed but you can hear the cooking activity (it isn't very distracting that you don't enjoy your meal, if you can still carry on with conversation, it's all good).\n\nI was so excited to dive in, I didn't take any pictures, but I can still see the delicious dishes in my head. (Before we went into the theater, we checked out the menu on Yelp, so we knew what we wanted.) We ordered the fried rice, chicken and yellow curry, chicken, which came with a bowl of steamed white rice. It was so yummy. The fried rice was flavorful without being overly salty. It was big. The curry dish was excellent. We had seconds but we also had leftovers. It was a little over $22, without the tip. \n\nThe wait didn't seem long at all. The staff was nice and our server was attentive, refilling our waters without us asking. (We got greetings both on our way in and as we were leaving.) \n\nI am sure we will be back as my husband loved both dishes, and I loved it too. Really satisfied our thai food cravings."

What bothered me was a couple groups came after us and they got their entrees and all the food way before us, within 20 minutes. I asked why it took so long, and they started explaining that bigger groups get superiority. Uh-no. We came in a good 15 minutes before them and got nothing. That's a weigh over money (larger groups), rather than taking care of customers in an etiquette manner. I found this completely unfair.

Hubby and I ordered the stuffed wings, (Sounded interesting) and I'm so glad we did. They were delicious, served with a spicy sweet sauce, yum! We ordered larb. They made it perfectly, with just the right amount of spice. We shared the beef salad with lemon dressing. The sear on the beef was perfection and the dressing was very refreshing. Hubby had a pork dish, pad prik pow (yes, that's really the name), but it was great. The service was very fast, friendly and done with a smile. I highly recommend this place. Excellent food, even if some of the names of their dishes sound.......wrong. Lol"

The only disappointing thing I've had was the shrimp roll appetizer.  It was whole shrimp wrapped in rice paper and deep fried, which was not at all what I was expecting.\n\nOne thing to note is Archi's has a few restaurants around town and the numeric scale they use to tell how spicy you want a dish is not consistent.  A 4/10 at one location is more like an 8/10 at another."

I have eaten a lot of Thai food since then and finally stopped in their new location at Village Square.  I had what may have been the best pad Thai ever.  Everything was excellent.  Had the beef salad, spicy basil beef, chicken pad thai, tom kha soup  and red curry chicken.  The only plate that I was not blown away by was the red curry chicken. The curry was excellent, but I think it was the chicken slices that could have been better. They were a little flat and dry.  But seriously this is one very small complaint.  Everything else was exceptional and again, best pad thai in a long time!!!"

When I can pay an extra $2-$3 for an infinitely better dish, it's a no brainer. The noodles are great. I usually get the Pad Seeyoo(sorry about the spelling) or Pad Thai. Both great options, but it really depends on the day. The chefs are usually pretty consistent.\n\nThai Basil Fried Rice is good too and the curries are delicious. One of my only complaints is that even though they ask you your spiciness preferred level (1-10), their tastes usually run hot. No biggie, but when I'm with people that want mild, they expect mild and I don't want them having a bad time that night or the next day.\n\nAnyways, Archi's is now in my restaurant rotation so I hope they continue to stay yummy."

Then I thought again ...I'll order a side of Pineapple Fried Rice just in case. My husband ordered the Thai Beef Salad which has grilled top sirloin, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, and hand-tossed in spicy lime dressing . That salad never lets me down..it always turns out really good. I ventured away from my usual chicken curry dishes and wanted to also order a salad. I chose the Papaya Salad that had sliced green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, dried shrimp, and spicy lime dressing. When I read it on the menu my eyes failed to see the dried shrimp. I was picturing nice big juicy shrimps on top of that salad. When they served it I thought \"Maybe I forgot to mention the shrimp\" ..because I couldn't see them. I started eating the salad and my husband starts eating it too. Then I tasted the little dried up shrimps which are smaller than the peanuts so they are barely noticeable. I dare not say a word because my husband loathes mostly all seafood and he already ate half of of the dish! It was a nice crunchy salad because of the papaya but I didn't mind. If I were to get this again I would have them leave out the dried shrimp because I'm not a fan of it. I also had my safe Pineapple Fried Rice which has Jasmine rice, stir fried with tomatoes, onion, green onion, pineapples, cashews, raisins, egg and cumin powder. It's a nice melody of flavor that blends nicely together. I had to stop myself from taking more than a few bites so I wrapped the rest of it for lunch for the next day. We ended with the Mochi Ice Cream which comes with three flavors we chose Red Bean, Green Tea and Strawberry for my husband.( He has a hard time trying new things) I always enjoy the ambiance here because it's relaxing and the food is delicious!"

Everything is custom cooked, hot, fresh and delicious. You get your choice of meat w/each dish and choose your heat level.

            "review": "Location wise is perfectly situated right by Regal Cinemas in Village Square! Conveniently accessible for those hunger cures before of after a movie.  For those unfamiliar...Archi's Thai Cafe may seem like another Asian/American Fusion like PF Changs...or pick up stiX...but in fact when one takes a closer look, 100% Authentic Thai is clearly shown.  Try and behold for this is true.  Upon first walking in, the restaurant feels small, but the wooden shutters, and wooden tables and chairs balances this out and gives you a good feel of solidity to its decor.  This is not your usual Asian themed furniture but don't let this fool you, for the food is as good as it gets.  \n\nWaiters will take your order and ask you from a level of 1-10 how spicy you would like your food to be, and plenty enough to satisfy all types of taste buds and spice level to handle.  Tom Kha may not be for everyone but It is a great little soup starter like won ton soup for Chinese food.  Price could be cheaper, but the quantity of food is decent enough and good enough for the price.  I don't know if your typical person would go everyday, but nice to have once in a while.  Thai food is comparable to Pin Kaow or Lotus of Siam\n\nArchi's is clean and food comes out at a respectable time frame. A little advice tho, get there before 6pm or off times because after 6pm the restaurant starts to get busy and picks up a lot of customers...you may have a line out the door or wait.  Others must think it is good though to keep coming back for more.  Give it a try...It is pretty good."

Um 2 please. She grabs two menus, puts it on the first table and walks away. Uh okay weird but whatever. Then after five minutes another girl asks if we want sometimes to drink and then another girl comes and asks what we want to order. The food comes out quick but here comes the girl with the bob again, she puts down the food at the edge of the table, doesn't even look at us and walks away. So now we're watching these girls and they're nice to every other table except us! My friend is Ethiopian and there is no one else in this restaurant with darker skin color and I don't want to say they were being racist but I don't know why else we were treated so horrible. These girls didn''t come back or say anything to us except fill waters but they kept watching us from a far and kept looking at us. I don't know, maybe they were hungry? But regardless, never coming back to this location again."

I had to tear apart the meat from the FAT using a spoon and fork.  3rd, we shouldn't have to ask three times for Water or Napkins. I mainly disappointed in the fact that my Hamburger I had earlier today had more lettuce than this Thia Beef Salad. Is there a shortage on lettuce I don't know about???

This is their 3rd and newest location.\n\nWe usually get the Pad See-Ew, Pad Thai, Spicy Eggplant, and sometimes a Thai Iced Tea. My wife also loves their Green Papaya Salad and enjoys their various curry dishes. For the spicy dishes, they will ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 0 to 10. We usually go with \"2\" because their \"3\" can be extremely hot, as in sweat-inducing, nose running-like-a-river hot! I can't even fathom what a \"10\" might be like. Their prices are very reasonable except I do get annoyed when they charge you $1 for a small bowl of rice without letting you know ahead of time. Pet peeve, I know.\n\nWhat distinguishes this place from most other Thai restaurants (and the original location) is the warm, clean, and contemporary interior. You feel like you are dining in an upscale restaurant instead of a hole-in-the-wall joint. Service is typically friendly and efficient.\n\nThe combination of quality food at reasonable prices, solid service, upscale ambience, and as an added bonus its proximity to home make this our go to place for Thai. Well done, Archi, well done."

I like my food on fire so of course, I ordered my food at a 10.  She told me it will be \"very spicy.\"  After I did that, I was nervous for a minute. Then, I got my food.  I got a Tom Yum Seafood soup at spice level 10.  Okay, it was hot and you could just smell the spice.  But for me, I think it was just right. In fact, I think I could've handled it spicier.  And from reading the reviews below, it appears that the spice level may even go higher - to a 30?!?!?!  Perhaps I'll have to try a higher level next time.  But in any event... the food was good.  The only thing that I didn't like was the summer rolls, but that's only because I think in my head I was thinking of the Vietnamese summer rolls.  These particular rolls were actually wrapped in a flour tortilla and on the inside, it had Chinese sausage, veggies, and other stuff.  It was different. It was good.

I used to frequent the movie theater next door when I was a teenage hoodlum and remember when this place used to be some really crappy Americanized Chinese food place that always smelled like crappy Chinese food. I was really surprised it was the same place considering how cute & Thai-like the inside looked! \n\nWe've sampled their yellow curry, panang curry, beef and basil, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, pad kea mao, and papaya salad. My favorite is the panang curry! Omgosh, it was so delish, until I went home and checked out the calorie content. Panang curry typically has about 40-50g's of fat for one serving. Ouch! Well, anything with that much fat better be worth it, and I'd say that one serving of panang curry is worth it. Their pad thai is on the greasy side and kind of bland when you think about what's in it. I definitely prefer the pad kea mao because it has more veggies and tastes like basil (yum!!!)  compared to what you'd get in pad thai with just bean sprouts & peanuts.\n\nI did not enjoy the papaya salad. It was my first time trying it, but for $10, you get a \"salad\" that has a grated green papaya and this \"dressing\" that just tasted like fish sauce? Did they give us the wrong sauce? I don't know. Regardless, I will be back to Archi's! It has a cute ambiance with some delicious options. Definitely try the panang curry & pad kea mao!"

So I decided to check out Rising Sun Sushi, which is supposedly located in the same strip mall (sign is still up), but after driving around the entire strip mall and not seeing any sign of Rising Sun and finding Archi's Thai Cafe next to the movie theater I decided to check out their dinner menu.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks nice, the dining area is split into 2 sections (at least), as I was directed to a corner table in the smaller more secluded dining section closest to the parking lot.  I was hoping to be seated in the main area, but whatever.  They have a few waitresses and 1 waiter, and I am not sure if they take turns in getting customers/tables, but I ended up with the waiter that still have a lot to learn about getting better at being a waitperson in a restaurant. If the number of guestcheck holders in their apron is a direct count of the number of tables they are currently assigned, then I would say he has 3 tables to look after while I was there, and he was overwhelmed with just those 3 tables.  After I ordered and the food was served (by a different waitress), he did not come by to check up on the table until I was practically done eating, and it took forever (at least 5 minutes, but most likely not more than 10 minutes) to have him come by again to pick up the money.  This while at least 10 people were eying me sitting there waiting, while they wait for a table to be freed up so they can get seated and order some food.\n\nAnyway, moving on to the food.  I have tried the curries before, and I thought about trying something new.  Sukiyaki (Thai Style) was what i ended up ordering, and I was thinking a Japanese Sukiyaki with Thai ingredients.  Completely wrong imagery!  What I ended up with was a bowl of Thai noodle soup that I remember eating at one of the street food vendors when I was a kid in Bangkok.  The flavor was the same as what I vaguely remembered. It was served piping hot (good), with lots of vegetables (sure why not), a lot of pieces of chicken and 2 shrimps, plus a side of chili paste (cool, you can adjust how spicy you want).  But still I thought that item was overpriced for what it really is, and I will not order it again.\n\nThe Thai Iced Coffee is still large, and I think is worth the price of admission, and still very enjoyable.  I sometimes feel like just ordering that to go, if I am too lazy to shop at one of the Asian supermarket that sells them premade in cans or as a mix.\n\nOverall:\nService: 2/5\nFood: 3.3/5\nPrice: 2/5 (For their Sukiyaki - Thai Style)\nAtmosphere: 4/5\n\nThis location is not recommended if you want to try Archi's and staying on the Strip, as their W. Flamingo location would be closer, and my experiences there have always been a good one. But if you live near this location, by all means drop by and try any of their curries."

I dunno, it's weird. I got there a little after lunch time started and it wasn't that busy. I was greeted by two waitresses and they were very friendly. \n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection, and most dishes you have the choice of what type of meat (or shrimp) that you want. I pretty much just looked for what I know, and ordered it up. My auntie ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken, i ordered the Curry and we shared a plate of Papaya Salad. YUMMY. It was so good, the curry had a nice balance of spiciness and creaminess with a touch of sweetness. The papaya salad was good too, when we ordered it they ask how spicy you want it. Well, other places you go to, when you say spicy it's usually just mild. HA HA. No, not in this case, it was so spicy we had to take it to go and work on it another time! :) But my favorite dish, till this day is the Pad Thai. It has such a RICH flavor to it, and when you receive it, YOU mix the noodles, sprouts and peanuts yourself. :) \n\nSo far, I'm liking it, I will be back hopefully next time to try out more dishes!"

We got our food and after only a few bites, my daughter needed to use the restroom. I could not locate a staff member to let them know that we would be right back so we left our practically untouched food there and quickly went to the restroom. Just before that, the restaurant started to get extremely busy and large numbers of people began showing up. We returned to our table about 5 minutes later, only to find that our plates had been cleared and they had already seated somebody else there. When i let the hostess know that we were at the restroom and not done eating, she said that they threw our food away because they thought we left without paying. I asked if we could be seated in a different table and have our order re-made quickly and she said that they did not have any tables for 2 people and that there was going to be a wait. I asked if they would be able to make our order to go and again, she said that there was going to be a long wait since they were busy. I also spoke to a manager about this who apologized, but again did not offer a solution. Even though we did not get charged for the few bites that we ate, i find it very frustrating that my dining experience was ruined (not to mention that I am trying to feed a 3 year old dinner) all because they got busy and in a hurry to seat everybody that showed up just after 5. I vowed then that i would never go back to this location. \n\nThen...today I was in the neighborhood and thought i would give them a second chance. I ordered a Thai beef salad (spicy #2). I have ordered this more than 5 times at this location and it was always perfect amount of spice for me. I also order it this way at the Flamingo location (which has always been amazing!) I was sooooo disappointed to taste my salad, only to discover that they did not put ANY spice at all. (totally changes the taste of the salad!) I called them from work (30 min away) and let them know. Instead of apologizing, they started yelling at the cook (with me still on the phone) and came back on the line and said that they did put spice and that #2 is not hot and i should have ordered it hotter. I told the girl that i always order it this way and i know they did not put any spice, she just said sorry i asked the chef and they did put spice (basically calling me a liar). She said that i could bring it back in and get a new one. I let her know that i work 30+ min away and i am not coming back on a Friday after 5 (considering my last Fri experience). She put me on hold and I think talked to a manager. She came back on the line and said that next time I should have brought it back right away. \n\nClearly, not returning here! Also, I am pretty upset about the whole thing, considering I have never left a review good or bad on yelp."

For all of the locations I've tried ( sahara, flamingo, and warm springs), heres my review:\n\nFood : always on point with their spicy level, tastes and look fresh, never found a hair in my food, and everything I've tried tasted so delicious (esp. Pad thai with beef)\n\nWaiting time: if you go there at a peak time for lunch or dinner, wairing time to be seated or get your food will take longer than usual but that's expected for any restaurant. Usually I find my waiting time to be OK\n\nCustomer service: this part let me drop down 2 stars. No matter what time, day, or which location I go to, customer service is just not good. One time I was still working on my plate maybe half finished,  but my server just took the condiments without asking me if I'm done with it or if I still need it. I find that so rude... and nobody really smiles"

The atmosphere in here is great, so eating in is always nice.  Take-out is always packed very carefully.  I've never had an order mix-up, or a leaky container. \nThe only issue I have with Archi's is that they don't seem to give you as much rice as other places.  If you order some curry, you get a box of rice.  If you order two curries, or a curry, and a tom kha gai, you still only get one box of rice.  I sometimes end up having to make more at home, which kind of negates the whole take-out thing.  I'll just have to remember to ask for more before I leave next time."

That probably doesn't say much, as I've only been to one other Thai restaurant. Came here around 6:30p on a Friday night. There was a little bit of a wait, (20 minutes), but no big deal. Started off with the Satay Chicken - nice and tender, and able to cut with a fork. I didn't really care too much for the Thai Egg Rolls, not that it was bad or anything, but it was just an ordinary egg roll. It did taste a little better with the peanut sauce from the Satay Chicken. Got the Larb (spicy sausage salad). My dining partner insisted on a spiciness level of 8, then after tasting it, proceeded to complain how it was too spicy - Lol! I liked it, but it was a little sparse on the salad part. Pad Kea Mow w/ chicken seemed to be a popular dish, so, we got that one too - it didn't disappoint. Even though those were the only dishes we ordered, there was enough leftover for lunch the next day. Service was good - server kept our water glasses full and frequently checked to see if everything was ok. On my next trip here, will try one of the curries, the spicy eggplant, and possibly the stuffed chicken wings."

The reviews also seemed like this place wouldn't disappoint.\n\nWhat started off as a positive experience, slowly and annoyingly became a long & drawn out waste of our time. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of waiting for our food, I became drawn in and aware of the time - I was starving! I saw that there were tables that were seated after us, receiving their food, I suppose it's because they were appetizers? I couldn't tell. I was still annoyed and very hungry. \n\nI kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food. At this point I was very antsy, hungry, and aggravated. My soda has watered down a lot at this point (I like to drink it fizzy with my meal.)\n\n45 minutes later, our food arrived. We asked the server if they could be so understanding to swap out my coke for a fresh one, since I hadn't even drink it yet and it had gone flat since we waited so long for the food to come out. The waiter didn't understand, he thought we wanted a coconut water - so he got the manager involved. The manager listened to our concern and request, but he said that they don't do that here and that our request was unusual. So we just had to say - ok thanks, never mind then.\n\nIt's just a simple coke - we were agitated about the extensive wait, my watered down coke that was clearly not drank from, but they weren't concerned about our complaints. He was polite and professional - but I still feel slapped for the whole experience. It wasted our time and not once did our server or any server come out to explain the long wait for our food or check on us. \n\nAlthough, we requested spice level 7, it was really a level 1. We asked 3 times for a chili tray to be refreshed as the chilies were gone - 3 different servers later, brought the chili tray. We also asked for lemons 2 times in a row, the second person finally brought it for us. There were a lot of servers but no one wanted to help our table. Our food was getting cold as were were waiting for these things.\n\nThe positive things I could take from this place was that the noodles were moist, the pad kee mao had nice flavor, and the pad thai (although bland) was a massive portion - I feel like it was at least 4 portions that they brought out, which is a good deal. \n\nYet, I wasn't a fan about the horrible service.  If I ever feel inclined to come back, I would order take out instead.\n\nMy search for a no fail and delicious thai restaurant close to home continues."

I order it for my kids and wind up eating whatever they don't finish.  It's even better the next day.\n\nWe usually get take out but the actual restaurant is wonderful.

            "review": "3 words: YELLOW CHICKEN CURRY. The curry is not a paste thick sort but rather a mixture of  sweet and spicy yumness! The spices in this dish are not overwhelming at all and they provide a taste like no other. Like most curry dishes you have to choose a spicy range from 1 to 10. I love spicy food and let me tell ya, 7 is pushing it but I've tried 8 and while it is very spicy, you can still taste well enough to enjoy the dish. So far everything I've tried has been delicious from Pork Phad Thai to their Tofu soup to Tom Kha Shrimp. If I had anything bad to say about Archi's it would be that their fried rice is mediocre, I've most definitely had better fried rice before, but its not terrible- just bland.  Make sure to try the Thai Tea with your meal- DELICIOUS! :)\n\nFor some reason this location is hidden away like some redheaded step child. Its a tiny location in the Village Square shopping center, but once you find it and go inside you will find a warm and friendly environment. This location is always clean and ready to serve. The staff is so friendly- I once picked up some take out and  the waitress offered me a drink  while I waited (which wasn't long)."

            "review": "When my youngest son and his fiancee brought me here yesterday for Lunch... I thought to myself as I walked in.... \"I've been here before... but when?\". They tried to bring me here last year when I was visiting, but Archi's Thai was closed that day... They took me to another place... and was extremely disappointed. As you can see by the rating, Archi's was a pleasant surprise and very good Thai cuisine... judging by the Lunch Specials.\n\nAs I told the kids... Archi's is deserving of 5-Stars for the sampling of the Lunch Special... and if the Dinners were as good and consistent as the Lunch Special that I had.\n\nAtmosphere is most unlike Southeastern Asian.... The decor is set in medium dark woods... furniture is French Provincial in style... pictures are, surprisingly, of Thailands French Colonial days with framed pictures of their former Royalty in Thailand of days gone by. You will be surprised by this atmosphere... a little of French Colonial in an Asian restaurant.\n\nOn the menu....\n\nTom Yum Soup (**** Complimentary) Lemongrass, Lime Leaves and Blue Ginger infused Broth, Mushrooms, Tomatoes and Lime Juice... sprinkled with Cilantro and Green Onions. For a smallish 3\" diameter cup / bowl... this Soup could be considered Thailand's version of Chinese Hot and Sour Soup. Dang good... but left me wanting more... but it's complimentary.\n\nLunch Special #4 - Red Curry Dish with Beef (***** $6.95 Shrimp-$7.95) Fresh Red Curry Paste in Coconut Milk with Zucchini, Bamboo Shoots (a lot of 'em), Basil, and Bell Peppers. \n\nWhen you order this... the wait-staff will ask you the degree of Hot-ness that you want your Soup (from 1 to 10... with 1 being a lack of Heat and 10 being Super Hot)... I was considering ordering the Soup with a 10... My son and his fiancee looked at me quizzically or amazingly. They really tried to convince me to reconsider.... I tried this tactic... I asked the waitress... \"If you ordered this, what number would you order?\" She replied with a 6. So, I compromised.... 8.\n\nWhen the Soup came out, The Soup was accompanied by a very small Green Salad which was totally inconsequential considering it's size; a Thai Egg Roll (***)... I really don't like totally Veggie Egg Rolls, and a thinly fried Won-Ton (****). This was just a small sampling of from their extensive menu.\n\nThe Red Curry Soup was something else altogether... As you travel West across SouthEast Asia... you'll notice that the Asian countries will be more influence by Indian Cuisine as you travel. This Soup was silky smooth from the Coconut Milk and the Red Curry gave it a warm color and unique flavor that only Curry can impose. Coconut based Soups are some of my very favorite. If I had to penalize the Soup for any reason, it would be for the amount of Bamboo Shoots... just too much. Otherwise, something you should try whether it be a Lunch Special or at Dinner.\n\nLunch Special #5 - Spicy Basil Dish with Beef (***** $6.95) Stir Fried with Zucchini, Bell Peppers, Garlic, Chili and Fresh Basil. This was a sampling that my son's fiancee obligingly gave me to try.\n\nA very delicious Stir-Fry with Ground Beef. I will try this next time... whenever that may be.\n\nWait-Staff was very friendly, helpful. I asked the waitress how the smallish chain came to be named Archi's... She said Archi was the nickname of the owner, who started his restaurants seven years ago. This location started up two years ago taking over a Pick-Up-Stix franchise that went bust. She also said the owner usually is at the Rainbow location ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/archis-thai-kitchen-and-thai-bistro-las-vegas ) since that was the original restaurant and is quite larger in size.\n\nOne other advantage of this location is the proximity to my favorite Cinema in Las Vegas... the Regal Village Square 18 ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/regal-village-square-18-las-vegas ). Archi's would be a good pre or post movie visit.\n\nBTW, Archi's has been rated the Best of Las Vegas 2005-2007."

I think twice out of a dozen times I had to wait roughly an hour for my food. My girl friend and I learned its easy to call and order it to go and enjoy the food at home while watching a movie. The space went under a remodel giving additional (much needed) space so wait times for a table are next to nothing when we go to dine in. \n\nCan't compare if to other Thai restaurants as this is my first Thai restaurant, but I do enjoy their food and believe they have set the bar high.

Their chicken pad thai is so good and their chicken fried rice is bomb. I was pleasantly surprised to see that not everything is bean sprouts and peanuts!  \n\nWe ordered those 2 dishes, an eggplant dish and a Thai iced tea which came out to be ~$40 including tax.  I wasn't too thrilled with the eggplant, it was a little bitter and harder than what I'm used to.  The serving portions are fairly large and we pretty much ended up taking 75% of the food home.  Yeah, pretty ridiculous that we ordered that much food for lunch, but they served as nice leftovers :)\n\nI would DEFINITELY go here again.  They also do take-out!

The pad thai and panang curry were pretty good.  I wish the curry had more a bit more curry...didn't seem to have much liquid but I liked how it had green beans.  When we ordered they told us it'd be 30 minutes.  Hubby went to pick it up after 30 minutes and he still had to wait another 10-15 minutes.  While he was waiting he spoke to a few other patrons who were waiting to be seated/pick up their orders and many of them said they've often had to wait an additional 30 minutes to pick up their orders.  And he said the place was packed with maybe six tables worth of people waiting to be seated.  I guess dinner options in Summerlin are pretty limited.  I think the food is worthy of a 3.5.  I'm going to give it another try and reevaluate."

The beef salad is always great and refreshing; and has a modest proportion of beef for the price. The curry is creamy and not overwhelming with a perfect blend of spices and goes great with the pineapple fried rice. I've tried plenty of Thai restaurants in town, but definitely keep Archi's as my top pick."

Hubbs ordered chicken pad thai, was lacking in a little acidity but it was not bad.  Again, the food was okay, but nothing fabulous.  On the plus side, portions were generous.The only weird thing was that we both ordered #6 spice to our dishes and my husband's dish was about 2 levels under my spice.  I really think mine was the true 6 ;) .  I hope it wasn't done on purpose after they took one look at the whiteboy and decided to underplay the spice request.  We did not attempt dessert because the service was way too slow.  I want to give it another try sometime but maybe during  lunch."

For appetizers we ordered the won tons and the satay chicken skewers with peanut sauce, both were very good. My entr\u00e9e was the red curry w/bamboo shoots and rice. It was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend ordered a ground chicken dish, I don't remember the name of his, but it was delicious, as well. \n\nI would have given them 5 stars, but we were with another couple and first they brought out our appetizers without bringing theirs and then they brought out our entrees without bringing out theirs, so we felt obligated, out of courtesy, to wait about 5-7 minutes for the rest of our party to be served first before we could eat. I didn't like that my food was just sitting there. Yes, I know I could have just started eating, but most restaurants serve everyone at the same time. Also, they serve the soda in cans, so there are no refills. I don't like when restaurants do that. However, the food was good enough for me to return."

I would recommend their Pad Thai lunch and Kung Pao chicken (better than Chinese kung pao). They serve consistently good Thai food with my only complaint being the spice number is not consistent. I've asked for spicy number 5s that may be more like a three on some days and like a nine on others. Yikes! But it's so good, I'll eat it anyway. I would suggest not getting the salads or the soups too spicy because the spice tends to overwhelm these dishes. Better to add more spice later than be sorry. Besides the lunch specials,  a few other favorite dishes of mine are the Panang curry, Massaman curry and Tom Kha Gai soup. If in season, try the mango and sticky rice for dessert. Love it!"

It is my guilty pleasure without the guilt.\n\nLets start off with my favorite dishes. \n\nThe yellow chicken curry is a balancing act of perfection. A carnival of different flavors melded together to make one kickass curry. Throw in some potatoes, onions, and carrots with whatever meat you desire and you have a hearty delicious meal on your hands. Choose your desired spicy level, give me a side of rice, and I'm done!\n\nNow the pad thai is easily one of the best pad thais I've ever had. It is not some fancy rendition of pad thai with overcomplicated ingredients or an unnecessary presentation. It's pad thai, with a side of chopped peanuts and baby sprouts. That is it. It does not need to be more than that.\n\nI will say that not all dishes are created equal at Archi's. Their fried rice is just not that well put together. It looks delicious but it just really falls short on the flavor department. And another shortcoming of Archi's is their inconsistant spice level. I usually order a spicy level of seven but it will vary wildly from mouth scorcher to somewhat mild. I think it depends on who is preparing it but make sure to keep that in mind when ordering.\n\nDespite the complaints, Archi's still goes down in my book as a solid place to get some pad thai or curry."

It's still moderately priced, but it was still disappointing to see the increase.\n\n- My beloved curry (spiciness level 3) was over spiced and over powering.  The beef was overcooked and tough.

This is a very dangerous thing!\n\nI get, exclusively, the Chicken Panang Curry because it is delicious. I use Archi's Panang Curry as my bar to which other Thai food is compared.\n\nPro-tip: they'll ask you if you want spicy level 1-10. If you're a fan of spicy food, it actually goes to 30 (in increments of 5 after 10). I get the 30. It's good. At the one on S. Rainbow a 30 is *incredibly* and inedibly hot for me. Here, however, it's only *incredibly* hot, and thus edible. Different Archi's have different levels once you venture into the land beyond the 1-10 scale. Tread lightly. Work your way up."

At around 10 dollars (including tax) I'd say their beef masaman curry is well worth the money.  It's definitely not the best.  My favorite so far would be Komol's (in Sahara) but this is a good alternative considering I live in Summerlin.  The reason I don't think theirs was as good was because the beef pieces were \"sliced\" (as opposed to chunks of beef like at Komol) and the potato wasn't cooked as thoroughly as I'd like (it was still kind of hard).  The service was subpar."

The interior is beautiful and the wait staff is very friendly. But if your like me and order take-out then prepare to suffer through ordering because one of the kitchen staff normally answers the phone and lets just say Ixnay on the English. But for the quality and price of the food you cannot beat it. \n\nI normally order the Chicken Satay and to be honest there have been times when this has been overcooked. But only when I phone in an order. And I can honestly say it's only been twice in 30 some odd visits. The peanut sauce is my favorite out of all the Thai places I've tried. Also on the appetizer front is Beef Jerky which comes with a light citrus sauce. I dont care for Thai Jerky on a norm but theirs is good. \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e my norm is Pad Ka Pow (Spicy Basil) Beef. It is ground beef in a spicy chili basil sauce with sliced bell pepper and zucchini. Seriously, it is without a doubt my favorite dish of theirs. The meat is so spicy and flavorful. It always clears the sinuses. If I'm not feeling Ka Pow on a certain night than I get Pad Thai. Their Pad Thai has a fresh taste to it. And while I enjoy shrimp Pad Thai; theirs while being good had the tails intact which is a pain in the keester. So I would suggest getting the chicken version of the dish.  I have had other various entr\u00e9es that are equal in quality and flavor. And love trying new dishes when ever I need a change. \n\nAnd finally dessert. They feature a plate of sticky rice with fresh fruit which is amazing. It's a bit pricey ringing in at $7 but I think it is worth it for the amount of yummy goodness you get. And it is easily big enough for two people. \n\nSo take a chance and try this place. As I have said it's the best Archies in town. \n\nHappy Eating,\nJace"

I hit up Buldogi's, Jollibee and Pyaar (R.I.P.) long before I even bothered to check this place out. Could it be living across the street from Basil n' Lime? I really don't know.\n\nSo I finally did check the place out. What a wise decision. :)\n\nThis may seem a little underwhelming to some because I had Pad Thai. I know, I know, too \"Americanized,\" but that's the very dish that eased me into trying and loving Thai food, and to this day I feel the only way l I can trust a Thai restaurant is if they do Pad Thai right. Anyways, on to how I felt about the Pad Thai. It came out in a HUGE plate, and they don't skimp on the meat (a very good thing since Basil n' Lime is starting to get skimpy with the meat in their Pad Thai). It was fresh, and of course it would be ridiculous to expect Pad Thai to not be greasy at all, but the grease was at a minimum, which was great. No groggy, increased blood pressure feeling afterward. The only issue I had with the pad thai was a few too many glass noodles, they really could have cut back on that (and looking at other plates around the restaurant it seems like they smother EVERYTHING in glass noodles) In addition to the Pad Thai, I also had the Thai spring rolls. These definitely could have used a little more seasoning, but they were fine when dipped in the sweet chili sauce on the side.\n\nThe service wasn't very attentive unfortunately, I had to flag people down for pretty much everything, and the fact that the restaurant wasn't even that crowded made it even weirder. The dining floor is very nice though. Small but cozy feeling, not cramped. The ambiance is also in a sort of middle ground between casual and formal. The decor was also very in character (with the exception of the small Budda (not Buddha) statue on the front table....wtf?). The chairs were uncomfortable though, just saying. \n\nMy bill came out to be about $13. At B n' L, it would be almost $16 or $17 for a similar meal, so that's one pro Archi's has over them.\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT:\n\nPros:\nFresh food.\nReasonably priced.\nThey didn't screw up the pad thai, a good enough pro in of itself.\n\nCons:\nIffy service.\nToo many glass noodles in everything.\nUncomfortable chairs, so it's probably better to do take-out.\n\nThe wtf?:\nIs the fat Buddha (appropriately known as Budai) apart of Thai culture at all?\n\nSuggestions:\nBe more conservative with the glass noodles. You only need a little bit of them for some crunch in the food, since they don't have much of a flavor on their own. \n\nWill I return? I'm really not sure."

The food can be great, which I will get to later, but I think what distinguishes Archi's from most restaurants in Las Vegas is their interior.

Maybe it just makes me feel like Archi has a good handle on things. \n\nAnd he does! After being a little Thai adventurous and eating all around town, I can confidently say that when the food is good it is really good. Granted, they do suffer from inconsistency from time to time, and their spice scale baffles me. A 3 can be mind-blowingly hot despite the fact that the scale supposedly goes to 10. Consider yourself warned. \n\nDespite that, when I want curry or Pad Kee Mow or a very respectable eggplant dish, I am happy to visit Archi's. The tofu in their stir-fry and noodle dishes is not the most flavorful, but I was obsessed with their Pad Kee Mow for at least a month. I became a little frustrated when the vegetable selection kept changing. How hard is it to give a girl a solid helping of real vegetables (baby corn does not count) with her noodles? However, on my last visit, I told the waitress \"lots of yummy vegetables please\", and apparently that is the secret phrase to unlock garden delight because I got mega-veggies. Splendid!\n\nThe service has always been no-water-glass-empty amazing when I have visited. Food comes out quickly and hot. Servers are always nice.\n\nI was teetering between a 3 and a 4 for Archi's, but Archi, I am slapping a 4 on your establishment because although the food is a little inconsistent, I really really appreciate the atmosphere, cleanliness and service, and when the curry stars align, the food is definitely fan worthy."

            "review": "Love this place so much. One of three restaurants that I crave on a multi-weekly basis. Everything is always fresh, service is superior, and ambiance is true to the classic Thai restaurant. \n\nDrinks are easy. They usually either crack open a young Thai coconut with a straw, or pour me an ice cold glass of Thai tea, depending on my mood. If I'm hungry enough for an appetizer, I go with the veggie egg rolls, and sometimes a cucumber salad with peanut sauce. For dinner, it is almost exclusively a beef salad with a request for lean beef (no, I don't like chewing on fat) and my absolute favorite, PANANG CURRY with chicken beast. I'm literally drooling while writing this. Panang curry is so creamy and spicy you'll want to order extra curry sauce, which I usually do. I've tried other things, that were admittedly delicious, but I can't not order panang. \n\nIf you're lucky enough to come in often, the hostesses/waitresses will likely remember you. This always adds to the experience, when they welcome me back and ask if I'd like my regular order. Nothing beats that feeling. \n\nAmazing service, amazing food. Get here."

I'm happy with everything I've ordered except the fresh spring rolls with Chinese sausage. I would not order that again.\n\nTheir lunch specials all come with their soup of the day, a fried spring roll, and a fried wonton. I've finished their lunch specials except for their Pad Thai. It's a huge serving, enough for two or three people. I like to eat Pad Thai with jalape\u00f1os for an extra spicy kick. Spicy basil with ground beef or fried tofu is another favorite of mine.\n\nTheir non-lunch choices- Pad Prik King, Rad Nar, Panang curry, red curry are wonderful choices too.\n\nTip-They are closed on Tuesdays which I thought was a weird day to be closed."

If you love spice, this is the place for you! My friends ordered 7's and I spent the entire time sniffling and sweating. Let's just say it was a very uncomfortable meal for me.\n\nThe tom yum kah with flat noodle was nothing special. It was loaded with mushrooms and noodles. I wish there was more chicken in it. The spicy garlic chicken was vey garlicky and served atop a bed of cabbage and broccoli. Healthy dish that came with a side of rice. The Panang curry was probably my favorite dish here. Definitely a must try! Lastly, the pad see ew was also yummy but nothing memorable."

I get it at level 7 cus I love the spices from Thai cuisine. We always have celebrations here or sometimes just roll deep for no reason.
