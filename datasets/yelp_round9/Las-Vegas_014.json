            "review": "I had pretty high expectations for my dinner, because my friend who took me just raved about.  Like many other yelpers I read on here, we had to remind the hostess several times we were still waiting for our table even though we had a reservation.  As for the service, our server was a doll, really I liked the guy and he had a great knowledge of the menu, but the restaurant moved at a glacial pace.  For one it took a long time for them to just take our orders.  As an appetizer I got the shrimp salad, which was very good and came pretty fast.  For dinner I got the Sheppard's Pie, and our entrees took a long long time to arrive, I didn't time it, but it was very obvious.  My pie, was ok, very salty, nothing I would really say wowed me (or was worth the hefty $23 price).  Dessert we had Sticky Toffee pudding, a personal favorite of mine and it was the best part of the meal.  It was very delicious.  \n\nMy husband had the fish and chips, which he liked, but thought was overpriced ($30).  He also had the corn soup, which was very good he said.  \n\nOverall, I would say go, but expect to be at dinner 2 plus hours, so if you have show tickets or somewhere to be, make an early reservation, because this place is slow.  I also think the prices are a bit hefty for pub grub.  If I went again I would just get an appetizer and dessert, because I found the main dishes disappointing and expensive."

            "review": "TL;DR: it was good but not $30 for a burger, fries and caesar salad good.\n\ni ordered medium-rare and bf ordered medium, they switched our orders and i ended up with the medium burger wondering why such an expensive burger couldn't be cooked the way i wanted it. upon inspection we realized that our burgers had been switched (which is strange because the waiter made a big deal of putting a flag on one of the burgers to remember which is which, lol) and so we traded burgers. the medium-rare was downright cold, which isn't how a proper burger patty should be.\n\nthe salad was really much too mild in flavor because the dressing didn't have enough kick. there were anchovies in the salad but they weren't salty, just oily and bland. overall the salad lacked salt and since there was no salt or pepper on the table i couldn't adjust the taste for myself.\n\nthe fries were really good though. crispy and garlicky, my favorite kind of fries :)"

            "review": "Disappointing. The fact that it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant got us excited and eager put our names on the hour long wait list. Ordered the Lobster Brioche and was VERY letdown. What I thought would be fresh, seasoned lobster over amazing fresh bread ended up being a mediocre cole slaw concoction  over a cold lemon poppyseed bread. Could have been great but tasted old and like it came off of an assembly line. Nothing special about it and felt like no passion or time went into it. Maybe the other dishes are better, but after the disappointing first dish we closed our check. Sadly won't be returning. Decent beer selection though."

I wasn't expecting much, as previous reviews have been mixed, but the Scotch Egg was phenomenal! It was so good that I stopped back in that night to have another pint of Innis and a scotch egg before my red eye flight out. Service was great, sliders were great, beer list is great. A great casual restaurant, through and through."

            "review": "Mr Ramsay got greedy here... this is supposed to be an in-between for his 3 restaurants in Vegas but it's overpriced and unimpressive. I love BurGR and GR Steak but this place missed the mark for me and I can't say I was surprised based on the reviews. We had a friend that wanted to go though so we gave it a try. \n\nRoast beef sandwich - \"would you like a sandwich with those fries?\" This is what they should ask when you order. The fries were impressive in both portion and taste and totally overshadowed the much less impressive roast beef sandwich. The caramelized onion au jus was awesome but they barely gave me enough for half of my already small sandwich. I ordered mine without the horseradish aioli as I'm not a fan of horseradish and honestly a good roast beef sandwich shouldn't need much else other than the au jus. The meat was good, not great and it was pretty much just lacking all around. At $18 I was quite disappointed. But again... fries... awesome. Had to ask for additional ketchup though as they brought out the smallest little half shot glass of ketchup lol\n\nWarm salty pretzels - 3 pretzel bread sticks for $8... umm... how about some free bread on the table? Isn't this pretty standard when you are paying for a nice meal?\n\nPEI Mussels & Clams - not my choice to order but I'm a fan of clams so I picked at it... and when I say picked at it.. I mean i had to literally pick at the plate to find the tiny bits of clam that had fallen out of all the shells. The chorizo was the best part of this dish and there was about 4 little slices of it.\n\nChicken Pot Pie - KC ordered this and enjoyed it but it was awfully small for $23. I took a bite and it had good flavor but the one she makes is better.\n\nOur friends ordered steak and caesar salad and seemed to enjoy it but felt like it was overpriced for the place.\n\nService was so-so... waitress was very friendly but made a few mistakes and forgot some things. She made up for it by comping the pretzels and I don't get too upset with mistakes as long as you are friendly and make an attempt to make up for it. \n\nNo ciroc at the bar?! Seriously... I just don't understand that. The place was packed though on a Friday night and I'm sure it will keep doing well with a great location inside Caesars Palace. Crazy tourists...."

The calamari was ehh, there wasn't a lot of bread crumbs; it was like eating plain squid but I have no problem with that. The toffee sticky pudding was unbelievably gooooooood.

I had the trio min-pie sampler and can't decide which is my favorite as all were yummy.  My husband had the fish and chips very well seasoned, nicely fried, not greasy and very flavorable.

            "review": "Ate here twice over the last weekend, the second time with a group of friends. \n\nOn the first visit I had the Ramsay's Tonic (a decent drink, but a hefty $15 price tag), and the Shepherds Pie. The Shepherds pie was delicious. \n\nFor the second meal a friend and I shared the meat plate, which was pretty tasty, just enough for a two person appetizer. I had the bangers and mash, and he had the chicken. The bangers and mash were ok, the gravy was pretty delicious, and fortunately not over-salted. My friend liked the Chicken but didn't finish it. Several other friends showed up and all had the NY steak, which none of them were particularly fond of. \n\nMy friend and I had two drinks each, the meat plate, and the two entrees. The total was $141.00...OUCH.\n\nService was decent both times, but the food is just too expensive to justify eating here. It just wasn't that good. If I'm in Caesars again I'll be eating at MESA for these prices."

We reminded the waiter about our drink order. The bartender was EXTREMELY rude to us laughing at us under his breathe. I have never experienced something quite like this. With such rude service, we cancelled our drink order. The bartender out did himself by being even more rude to my family! Very disrespectful. \n\nWhen we asked to speak with the manager it took him over 5-10 minutes to come speak with us. He had an inadequate response. \n\nWe ordered simple appetizers, truffle fries and nachos. The fries were not acceptable in any way to serve. There was an excessive amount of oil on the fries (a puddle) even the manager didn't think it was edible. \n\nThis is the worst restaurant in ceasers palace. They dont even deserve the one star that I am giving them. The only thing I can do at this point is to steer others away from this restaurant!!\n\n\nHorrible experience. DO NOT COME HERE. I WILL NOT BE BACK."

The bread basket is actually 3 mini pretzels, which were delicious and it was a nice change. The potatoes were topped with parmesan and complemented the steak quite well. The steaks were cooked as we had asked and were absolutely delicious. The thing i was not pleased with were the sauces that they have. Everything has a bitter funky taste to it. I am not sure if they are adding mustard or horseradish or what the deal is but when i have ketchup i want it to taste like ketchup. The prices don't really match the ambiance and the decor offered here. This place is more of a bar/grill rather than a steakhouse but you will pay steakhouse prices. It is a nice place to grab a dinner and a beer."

My husband and I went to eat last night (a Wednesday night) and literally waited nearly 15 minutes for one of the two waitresses mindlessly walking by us to either acknowledge us or even say hello. Nothing! Shame on you for the piss poor service at this location with Gordon Ramsay's name on it. I would hate to see the service on a weekend when it actually is busy. Needless to say we left and had an amazing meal at Mesa Grill and dropped $300 for dinner. Totally worth it, so the silver lining was discovering a much better dining option at Caesar's!"

Once arrived, we were blown away.\nThe staff was so incredibly courteous. We met a gentleman, Randy, who was so friendly and welcomed us and told us we had just missed Chef Ramsay as he has been there the night before. My husband was a little bummed as Hell's Kitchen is one of his favorite shows. Randy not only went out to his car and found a sample menu from the challenge from the evening before (to give to my husband), he also made an effort to send out the ever so awesome, Chef Scott Cummings! And, what an awesome guy he was, too! The meal was extraordinary-- I wish I lived in walking distance so I could enjoy the delicious Caesar salad with grilled-to-perfection chicken every day! Not to mention the dessert---WOW! Whatever you do, order the Sticky Toffee Pudding! SO good. Overall, just a really incredible experience from the hospitality, the food, the long distance Randy went to to make up for the fact we had missed Chef Ramsey, and being able to meet Chef Scott Cummings. Very fun- cannot wait to come back next time we visit Vegas!"

A nice young man immediately arrived and filled our water glasses.  Our waiter, Christopher, was very friendly and professional.  My 4-year-old grand-daughter was sleepy and in a bad mood, but Christopher's interaction with her really cheered her up and made our entire dining experience so much more enjoyable.  The food was great!  We ordered the fish and chips, lamb burgers, hamburger, salmon, curry, and appetizers, as well as desserts.  Every item was excellent!  The soft pretzel and wing appetizers were good, all of our entrees were outstanding, and all of the desserts were perfect.  I do recommend that you dine here at off-peak times for best service because this casino complex is always packed with visitors.  This is one of the best pub-style food places in Las Vegas.  No disappointments."

The burger was too spicy, so order it if you like hot burger. Calamary was yummy and it was a decent big portion. \nI expected more tasty and fansy food from Ramsey's kitchen ( because of his shows and the way he critices chefs) but anyway it was on good level.\nI change my review to 4 since the customer service and care is excellent and this is what makes me feel respected."

It's 2 hunks of fish in a light batter, over skinny fries. No peas anymore. My soda was $4, which my server didn't refill until prompted. \n\nStephen had the pie sampler which he liked. It didn't look that filling for $18, but he seemed to find it adequate. \n\nOur lunch would've set us back $57 but since I gamble a lot, I used my points and got it complimentary. Score!"

Because, we already received a discount with our comps we decided not to complain about the issue. However, I was informed by  my friend that another guest had experiences the same problem in which she read on Yelp.\n\nFood - it was actually above mediocre for bar food! I especially liked the French Onion! The decor was trendy and meshed well together, all the way down to the silverware. Kudos to the interior designer and restaurant consultant that created the vision and theme. Even the music, Depeche Mode and The Clash, was on point! \n\nService - Disappointing. Server is on his phone in clear sight of guests. The table behind us actually had to get up and tap a server on the shoulder to get assistance. The server, in turns, mocks the guest to another co-worker a few minutes later. Although, the server and server assistant were cordial to us and even doing their touch backs, professionalism lacked.\nHostess did do the initial verbal greet and eye contact but lacked personality."

From the outside it looks like a hip restaurant. I would describe it as an upscale pub.\n\n===Service===\n\nThe service here was extremely slow. Our waiter took at least 10 minutes just to come and take our order. It took an additional 35 minutes just to get our food. I understand the place is pretty busy, but they should already know the place will be packed on a Saturday night and have the correct amount of staff on hand. \n\n===Food===\n\nComplimentary bread and pretzels: The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick, but they were perfectly chewy and soft. They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter. I'd recommend going with the cheese sauce. The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top. Definitely not as good as the pretzels.\n\nBraised beef cheek: Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. This dish was very disappointing. The beef cheek itself didn't taste fresh. Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold. You get that layer of oily white fat. It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all. Also the gravy was pretty bland. Not worth the $28. 2/5\n\nPan seared diver scallops: Braised artichokes, baby carrots, pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth. They give 4 scallops in this dish. It's not very filling at all since they don't give any type of carb with this dish. It could definitely use some risotto, mashed potatoes, pasta or anything that's a carb! $32. 2.5 stars\n\nOverall, I was sadly disappointed with this Gordon Ramsay location. The service was poor and the food was boring. I personally wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that I know."

I can't believe Ramsay would even want his name associated with this restaurant. We tried multiple dishes on the menu including the caesar salad, beef pie, scallops, and lamb. The caesar salad had overly fishy, bad tasting anchovies which you could barely taste under the dressing the salad was drenched in. The beef pie was not only much too salty, but too peppery as well. The scallops must not have been cleaned because eating them was like eating a handful of sand on the beach. They were also in a chowder type broth that was mostly potatoes with no flavor. The lamb was nothing special and irony tasting. We enjoyed nothing except our cocktails, which by the way were excellent. Guess this is the place to only grab a drink. I would expect food like this at Denny's, but not at an extremely high priced restaurant with Ramsay's name attached to it. \n\nThe best part if the story is that this awful foodie experience took place on a night that Ramsay was actually visiting the restaurant, but he clearly wasn't watching what was going on in the kitchen and was preoccupied by fans. If we couldn't have a somewhat decent meal with him there I would sure be afraid to try this place when he isnt there. \n\nThis really should be his next stop on Kitchen Nightmares."

As we were making our way out of the restaurant my mom informed the manager of the poor service we had encountered.

May I say if I wanted to feel like I wanted to be in one of your 'Kitchen Nightmare' shows this was it - at your very own restaurant. !! I am very disappointed Gordon.\n\n Arriving Thursday evening, four front of house lady restaurant hosts in their tight fitting 'London' dresses (just to remind you you were entering the land of british cuisine) sparring over seating arrangements on their seating/reservation computer made for great amusement as the restaurant waiting line grew. \n\nEventually getting to the front we asked whether we wanted to sit on the low tables or higher tables - we indicated lower. A few minutes later one of the other hosts took us to our higher table - we told her of what we had asked for - she seemed confused - however we told her we'd stay at the table she'd taken us to - communication a problem here ?\n \n After five to ten minutes waiting our waiter Ali D came along. A young chap who told me he had been educated at a college in Birmingham, UK and had attended business school but had come back to the States to waiter because the money was better 'waitering'. Taking my order of Shepard's Pie and a pint of Fullers he promply disappeared. Twenty five minutes passed and then the Shepard's Pie turned up.\n\nAli still no where in sight with the beer. The bowls for the Shepard's Pie are circa 7\" are smaller than what you think, however quality over quantity here as you are paying $23 for a tasting experience Ramsay style.  Asking this waiter about my drink - he promptly left and ten minutes later Ali turned up with the drink ! yeah ! - only 40 minutes to get a drink. !!\n\n Quality of the Shepard's Pie - packed with lamb and vegetables , it was not extraordinary in anyway , however what let it down considerably was the mash potato topping which was watery, singing to the fact this thing had just been microwaved - either that, or Gordon's mum had trained Gordon to make mashed potatoes this way - I think not.  \n\n After finishing this and waiting another ten minutes for Ali to come back, I decided to be brave and order the Sticky Toffee pudding. At this point , I had a further surprise - a bread basket appeared !! another first for me - isn't this suppose to appear at the start of the meal ? \n\nFive minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes , boy how long does it take to make this dessert ? Ali passed  us a number of times and no comment from him. Eventually I flagged down another waiter and told him I was 'pissed' and wanted to see my waiter. A few minutes later Ali turned up, telling him promply to cancel the dessert offering and get me the bill. No apologies or anything, he left the table. Bringing us the bill for, you've got it, for $122.00 !!! - instead of $32 - way to go Ali !! . \n\n At this juncture, I think one of the other waiters must have summoned the attention of the evening manager Brian Ward. Brian was exemplary in apologizing\nfor the level of service I had received and invited me back to experience the restaurant one more time as I had a couple more days in town. He gave me his card and I thanked him for coming over to make amends. \n\n Unfortunately Gordon, there are many other places in Vegas to eat and this is one restaurant of yours I shall not be returning to. This place is a disaster and I'd strongly urge you Gordon to get on the next flight here to shake things up as\nthis restaurant could be on the road to no where sooner than what you think.\nSorry to give you this news, but as a fellow Brit - I have to be honest.\n\nIf you want me to show your Chef there how to make Shepard's Pie - I'll gladly take the F Word challenge against him/her and see who wins."

But I am glad I did. \n\nAs much as I love to read other people's reviews, I have to say, not one experience is the same as another. Nor does everyone have the same tastes buds.\n\nThe appetizers alone, can be your main dish for the night due to the large proportions. I had ordered the shrimp cocktail and the size of the shrimps were huge ! The appetizer by itself had filled me up !\n\nMy boyfriend had ordered the grilled lamb burger, my mother-in-law ordered the mac and cheese, my father-in-law ordered the New York strip, and my bother-in-law ordered the lobster mini rolls.\n\nAll the dishes were fantastic, especially the mac and cheese and the lamb burger ! However, service was extremely slow."

Manager came when we complained - with water but no apologies like \"hey you complained about water so here's your water\". Great except we wanted the water 30min ago and now just want the check. I wasn't even that mad because I understood it was busy but that felt like a little slap in the face. So we left upset with a bad experience. \n\nGo somewhere else for the vegas experience because you won't get it here. BTW $18 for 2 small burger sliders."

            "review": "Were I writing this solely based on the food, I would go 4 stars, but the service and high cost to food ratio knock it down to 3. \n\nWe were seated right away, but in requesting that we did not get one of the \"high\" bar style tables we saw at the entrance, were shown instead to an oversize \"booth\" consisting of a table and two large but lightweight movable couches. This proved to be somewhat uncomfortable, I felt like I was hunching over my food the entire meal as the table was too low for the level of the couches and the couches better suited for lounging than eating. All I could think was, if I wanted to eat dinner at my couch in front of my TV, I would do so. Might be fun with a larger group but it was not very intimate for 2. \n\nSo lets get to the food, we had the calamari appetizer which was light, perfectly fried and tasty, and also a decent size portion as well. The accompanying sauces were the standard cocktail and aioli, uninventive but appreciated. We both decided on the lamb burger, which was enormous. If anything the meat to bun ratio here is unbalanced, the patty could be downsized a little bit or bun upsized without losing anything, the meat overwhelmed the remaining ingredients on the burger to the point you felt like you were eating just a big pile of patty. It was a very good lamb burger nonetheless.  Meanwhile, the accompanying fries were nothing to write home about, and like the fried squid, they also came in a suitably large portion. \n\nThe service was surprisingly poor, my iced tea glass remained empty at one point for more than 10 minutes during our meal, and we were not attended to promptly when sitting down. I suppose by American standards the service was \"normal\" and Europeans would find it too fast a pace. \n\nLastly, the place was quite expensive, you do indeed pay for the name in addition to the food. Two burgers, an appetizer and two sodas cost us $85 with tip. I was expecting this, but its worth noting nonetheless."

I don't know if things changed from that last Yelp Elite event or something, cuz that was all 5 star reviews. What I DO know is that I couldn't be happier with the meal i just had!\n\nThere are really clever design elements everywhere you look, from the hand-painted Keg wall to the 70s British punk uniforms for the staff, the distressed effect menus on wood boards, and the hand-hammered silverware that makes you want to buy a castle and tall-back velvet dining chairs just to put that silverware in it. So from an aesthetic standpoint, it does not disappoint at ALL.\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me were the handmade soft pretzels appetizer. I just had to have that. SO good. They're amazing and come on a tray with a spicy, horse-radishy melted cheese and pub mustard. We also shared an order of the craziest (and most delicious) deviled eggs I've ever had. Four egg white halves seasoned with a warm, sparkly vinaigrette, and a bowl of the yolk seasoned with mustard, bacon and herbs. \n\nI ordered Shepherd's pie, because it's one of Gordon's signature dishes, and because I have YET to have a decent Shepherd's pie in this country, though I keep trying. This was the best I've had anywhere. The stew was so rich and flavorful, and the mashed potatoes were perfect, with just the right amount of brown on the peaks.

But what was so disturbing was the customer service by the managers and the waitress It was terrible. They over charged us, and we didn't see it until we payed the bill and that's how we felt they did this cause we had a group of 7 and they thought we would not notice.  It took forever to get someone to give us attention. Management (randy)did not try to do anything to defuse the the situation. It was so bad my son got upset not only because of the charges but it was my birthday, then they called security, instead of fixing the situation they call security but then the check was still wrong and while security ( Michael) was there they agreed, the bill was wrong. The incompetent waitress was to separate the bill five guest on one check two on the other she didn't do that so what happened , they charged the bill completely for seven people with tax and  gratuities when it should've been for only five because the waitress didn't separate the bills. This will be our last visit. We spent over $300 and this is the service you give. I will make sure I pass on this experience."

Eventually we're seated, smack in the middle of the dining room that is visible from the casino, good table, near a POS/waiter station.   18 minutes later - yes, eighteen, the waiter comes by, politely greets us, asks about drinks, but we didn't have a drink menu.  He was trying his best, but good service is not solely the poor waiter's responsibility.    \n\nWhen we placed our drink order, we placed our entire order (app, 2 entrees).   Bread plates were provided, then breads were brought.  Breads were finished, so empty crock, tray and 2 small bowls for sauces remained on the table.  (did I mention the waiter station/lsland 6 feet from us).\n\nOur appetizer came, long plate, used our bread plates for serving plates.  Finished, and now all those plates were still at the table.  Our entrees came, after having been walked around to the dining room with the beer barrels (cause I saw the food go by me first, then come back).   Plates were set, we moved our bread plates to the side on top of the appetizer long tray - and there they remained.\n\nThe only redemption was the food was good.  My husband ordered Shepard's Pie, which I wish I would have ordered as it was very good.  I had fish and chips, which, one of my fish got soggy at the bottom, but another was crispy.  I read critiques that the chips weren't authentic - I liked them.  My guess if I had to replicate at home, is that you take 1 potato, make it a thick steak fry - so 1 potato = 1 fry; and they probably use the rest of the sides for the mash, but I liked them.\n\nThere was another manager type, male this time, (manager noted by his not wearing the punk suspender type clothes waiters were wearing) and this guy looked so sleazy .  Sweaty - seriously, like the kind Gordon rips to shred on Kitchen Nightmares.   I actually told my husband it looked like the KN in NY where this godfather type guy wore the trench coat and glasses and they owned a lobster house, and argued with Chef about \"maine lobsters\".  This guy seriously went to the table behind me, about 12 times.  And please, I'm not knocking appearance, I'm not a barbie type person, but I do expect people regardless of age or size, to look presentable, meaning, clothes fit properly, clothes are clean & neat.   Not sure what the couple did or who they were to warrant attention every 7 minutes, but obviously this clueless manager couldn't turn his back and see a stack of empty plates at our table while we were trying to finish our entrees!\n\nAlmost thru our meal, the waiter came buy, said could I take those plates, since you've been staring at them your entire meal.   Again, he was waiting every table in that dining room, and he was hustling, but no support!  At one point when we finished our meal, he ask someone when he saw us finish, to please bus our table - and he did, about 10 minutes later.\n\nNever did I think a pub meal would take 2+ hours.  Again, it's Vegas, so yes, it's over priced, but shamefully not worth it.  I won't be back.  The poor front of house isn't a testament to starting pains, it's poor execution and leadership.  I'll keep watching the damn shows though!"

After I said I was done and he cleared my dishes, I had to wait over five minutes to get his attention so I could ask him for the bill.\nAnd the food was almost as bad.

Luckily, we had made reservations, so the seating wasn't a hassle. The decor is that of an upscale pub. It was warm and inviting, but still felt too modern to have that \"Old English\" feel. Either way, it was nice to be there. As we were sat by a smoking hot hostess, we were immediately delivered water and bread. The bread basket was out of this world! Especially the pretzel bread. I ordered the pork bellies and fingerling potatoes. Rarely do I say this, but the side dish was WAY better than the main course. Don't get me wrong the pork bellies were crackling good and tender, but something about those potatoes that drove me insane! Overall, a fantastic experience with a cool way to order your drinks- thanks to the sophisticated computer tablets on the table. But like I said, a good time was had by all and the food was delicious. I recommend."

Not the best start to the evening...but I thought the SMS system was cool - leave a number and they text you when the table is ready.\n\nGot myself a Strongbow cider to go with the bread and pretzel.  Came with butter and some odd cheese sauce that didn't really do any justice to the pretzels.  Still, the caraway seed bread was tasty.\n\nWe started with crab salad with pickled radish and corn soup to share.  Crab salad was very good, lots of crab meat - though I wouldn't say the little bits of crab bones/shells were any good for the texture.  Suppose it's hard to get everything when there's that much crab meat.  Corn soup was kind of plain, even with the minced crab in it, and didn't have enough corn kernels to call it corn soup - unless it was pur\u00e9ed...then I just didn't taste it.\n\nWife had mussels and clams.  Was an enormous pile of them.  She was salivating when I was taking photos, but a few bites in she thought the broth brought out too much of the fishy taste in the shellfish.  Most chefs would use some butter, sake, or wine to cut the fish taste a bit - not here.    Needless to say, she didn't finish the dish.\n\nI ordered the shepards pie.  After watching GR enough on tv, I'd figure I'd try his signature dish out and see what the hype was all about.  One of his biggest peeves about the pies he tries is the amount of grease in the dish.  Well, his kitchen staff must have missed those episodes, because my pie was chalk full of grease.  The meats in the stew itself was nice and tender, albeit a bit bland; but with the mashed potatos soaking up all the grease, the dish got to be really heavy.  Texture wise though, the dish wins 5 stars - creamy mashed, chewy meats, and crunchy vegetables makes for a texture dream.\n\nWaiter asked how things were at the end and we started into some of the things above; but as he was tuning us out the moment his question was finished, we didn't bother to go into much detail.  We had hopes of bringing a visiting friend next week, but in the end, we decided on two things -- not to get a dessert as to prolong the staffs evening, and not returning for another visit. \n\nGood night."

Anyways I had high hopes for this place since Gordon Ramsay is known as that judge that insults people for messing dishes up. He needs to come to this location and train these cooks... better yet insult them. KIDDING. When I took a bite out of my Butter Chicken Curry, it was very bland, along with the saffron rice. Curry and saffron rice are supposed to be flavorful, which they both lacked.. I guess I shouldn't have expected a strong flavor of curry since this is a pub & grill... BUT its GORDON RAMSAY! Why put it on the menu if its not a dish you specialize in. Note: the menu is pretty limited with signature dishes.\n\nMy bf got the fish and chips with peas, and that was just okay as well... IDK if it was an off day or what, but everything felt under-salted. The experience there was also meh, service was just OK,  the waiter asked us how our mixed greens salad was, and never checked up on us when we got our entree's. \n\nFortunately, there was a good ending to our meal, which was the sticky toffee pudding -- it comes with caramel sauce and vanilla ice-cream (ice cream was the best part) and that kind of made up for the lack of flavor from our dishes, it's really sweet, but the vanilla ice cream gave it a nice balance.\n\n\nWould I come back? \nOnly if GR himself were there."

You only get three and they are super tiny but they are good. The fries are sooo good. I ordered a side since I got an appetizer and it was a huge side for one person. Keep that in mind...you can share. \n\nI requested Sara when I came back because she was so friendly! On my second visit I tried the Steak Cheek sandwich ($18) because the pictures on here looked yummy. It was completely different than anything I would normally order but it was very good. I would recommend putting some of their \"special mustard\" on it. It has horseradish and adds a nice taste.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was absolutely delicious! It comes with caramel on the side...the more you add, the better it is.  This is a must!\n\nMy only complaint is $4 for a soda.

The menu's food offerings were all tempting and while waiting for our beers, we debated which we wanted to try. \n\nJulio returned with some bad news; neither of the beers we chose were immediately available, which made us turn back to the menu and we went for Gordon's favorite, Innis and Gunn. \n\nShortly, we were introduced to Randy Goldich, the bar manager, who apologized for the unavailability of our original choices. We appreciated his candor and spent several minutes chatting before he left us to enjoy our drinks. \n\nOur waiter Julio and his partner David were quite attentive and soon we had our meal selections; I had the grilled lamb burger and my wife had the Pub Chopped Salad.

So disappointed!!!!!\n\nWe made reservations for 7:30pm, arrived 20 minutes early so were shown to the bar. After waiting until 8:00 pm, and having to check with the hostess, we were finally seated at an empty table that we noticed was empty the whole time we were standing bar dodging the waiters/waitresses coming through with trays of drinks. \n\nAs soon as we sat down, a waiter tried to deliver a yummy looking dessert, but we hadn't even ordered yet!\n\nThree of us ordered the fish and chips and the other ordered mixed grill. After about 45 minutes, two fish and chips and the mixed grill were served. We all sat there for another 15 minutes for the last poor guy to be served.  By the time all the food was served, everything was barely warm. The fish was only so-so, \"the chips\" (big fat fries) were very good, but not chips! The peas were good. On the mixed grill, the shrimp was tough, and the pork belly was fried so long it was hard.\n\nI think this restaurant is overpriced, but great service and great food are worth it. Unfortunately, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill had neither."

Our waitress forgot our drink orders, so she came back to ask us what they were 15 minutes after she promised to get us some glasses. We decided to cancel our drink orders right then and there, because hey, why spend $11 on a beer when you can get drinks for free while gambling? She then brought out our canceled drinks 5 minutes later, reminding us that she had in fact remembered to enter in our drink orders. Uh, what the !@#$? We asked that she take them back.\n\nOther than the strange drink order situation, the food was nothing more than mediocre. But ridiculously expensive. My stupid salad was $17. The scotch egg appetizer was $11. For one egg. I know prices are high in Vegas, but for the spotty service and so-so food, this is a big no-no.\n\nI still can't believe this place exists.

The GM contacted me to apologize, explained that he would be working with his staff to rectify my complaints and, offered to have me come back so he could  make my next experience a better one. I was taken a back and thoroughly impressed by this; it says a lot about this business and how they represent themselves. \n\nAlmost 6 months since my contact with the GM, I reached out to see if the offer was still on the table. And on March 28 I had an amazing 40th birthday filled with great friends, incredible food, wonderful sevice and a restored, impressive experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grille! I went with no expectations and told my friends they might send out a special appetizer or dessert, but they went above and beyond my/our expectations! Our server talked about the menu and\n answered our questions expertly, the drinks were delicious,  the appetizers and main cooarse were incredible (I suggest the lamb burger!!!!), and the dessert was UNBELIEVABLE; sticky toffee pudding with one of the most delicious house made caramel sauces all of us had ever had! Then to top off our experience we got to meet the winner of Last Year's Hell's Kitchen, Scott Commings! I'm embarrassed  to say I cried, I was so over joyed!\n\nAside, from all the generous things done for us, I have to say I cannot wait to go back to Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grille the next time I'm in Vegas. It truly is a great restaurant with traditional pub food that is made expertly with a presentation that sets them apart from many restaurants. You can tell they take pride in every thing they send out. I highly recommend you visiting this restaurant when you are in Vegas, and don't forget to get the on tap Guiness and sticky toffee pudding with house made caramel sauce!"

This time I had the chicken wings which are crispy and super flavorful. The bleu cheese that comes with is about the best I've ever had. We had the hummus and olive appetizer. Again, the hummus is the best I've ever had. Lots of flavor going on here. The Mac and cheese comes in a smaller portion but is good.  \n\nOn prior visits I've had the steak which is a great choice and worth the money. The hamburgers are smoked and quite enjoyable. \n\nThis place can fill up so maybe try coming on off hours. The one complaint I have about Gordon Ramsey's pub is that the service can be slow. I've noticed this with all the times I've been here. The staff is friendly, but you may not see them for a bit between courses. If you're not pressed for time and just want to relax and enjoy your meal, the slow service may not bother you.\n\nOverall, superb food and drink. Not a bad thing on the menu. The level of flavors in every dish are incredible."

Now, I understand the place is not geared for kids, there was no kids menu available. But I really appreciated their accommodating our little party. The manager made a special point greeting our little munchkin, and made her day by giving her a Gordon Ramsay pen...it instantly became her favorite art instrument of choice.\n\nThe deviled eggs were expensive, at over $3 per bite, but really surprisingly bland. Fish and chips consisted of two huge fillets of crispy but bland fried cod, a nice version of mushy peas, and large serving of steak fries that were just meh. The $45 ribeye was a perfect medium rare, but was marred by being excessively gristly and fatty without being particularly marbled. The accompanying bear aide sauce was a cold, congealed mess. Come on Gordon, at these prices you can afford to serve better quality than this! \n\nSpeaking of prices, single bottles of hard cider were $11...a \"special\" was a bucket of five beers for the low, discounted price of...$40!  Whoa!"

Condiments, just adds more texture and intensifies favors. Our starter was lolipop wings with bacon blue cheese dipping sauce. I didn't get much bacon flavor. Wing itself wasn't too spicy or too sweet. Very mild yet good kick of spicyness follows. \nAgain, for wings and burger, it is expensive, but it's the price tag for the experience.

It seemed like you had to ask for every little thing (refills etc). Mostly importantly, we ordered 1 salad and 2 entrees. Over an hour later we finally get the salad and about 5-10 mins later we get the entrees. We noticed it was taking a long time and inquired but just got a passive \"it should be coming out real soon!\". We noticed from afar the manager (which we found out later) was peeking at us to see if we got our salad etc. It wasn't until I went to the hostess and asked the manager to come over that he finally did. He didn't introduce himself as the manager, just came over and said, sorry the salad took so long. He didn't even initially address why it was taking so long for the entrees. Also, we noticed tables around us getting their entrees way before us. Rather than trying to defuse the situation, the manager seemed to try to defend the poor service. \"I don't know what the people around you ordered\". \"Your entry is late because your salad was late and that caused your entree to be late\". He left the table and said he would subtract the salad. Finally, the entrees came and they were mediocre at best. The chicken pot pie was mostly gravy and hardly had any chicken in it. It also was rather smallish for the price (I'm not a huge eater either). The steak seemed like a poor quality cut and was overcooked and not tender at all. After everything was in the ditch, there was no follow-up. The management doesn't seem to understand \"writing the best last chapter\". Things WILL go wrong in the service industry, but it's how you handle it and how you send the customer away.\n\nGordon Ramsey needs to have more quality control. He needs to pay this place a visit and throw the book (soup?) at them. \n\nSo my biggest gripe was the service followed by less than mediocre food. I might as well just went to the quick food place next door (Cypress?). They are located across from the Colosseum. I would never chance going to that restaurant before a show.\n\nThere are some awesome places to eat in Caesar's Palace but I would definitely skip this one."

Furthermore, there was no sauce on the spot and cheese was no where to be found which made it very dry. :(\n\nThe truffle chips were good. It was served with ketchup and a truffle aioli sauce.

A small container of caramel came on the side so we poured that over the bread-like substance. This dessert has to have been the best part of my dining experience here.

We didn't wait long, even with a bit of a lunch rush, and the iPad thing for viewing and picking out drinks and dessert was interesting (a bit confusing at first, but our waitress explained it to me quickly). If I go back and have a friend, I would totally take them to this place for a lunch.\nThe beer-battered fish & chips was a bit sweet for me, but generally good. The chips were cooked well and the smashed peas tasted nice. I had a specialty drink (forgot which one) but it was great as well - enough alcohol to make me happy, not too much to overpower.\nI may also now be a fan of trifles after the one I had. Perfect amount of chocolate to make it sinful, but not overpowering. \n\n...also, I want the waiters and waitresses outfits. they're awesome."

            "review": "When you are in Vegas eating out is a chance to have a one of a kind experience, which is why my mom, brother, and I chose this place when walking through Caesar's Palace. Well, clearly we should have kept walking. The service was not good, I don't think our waiter smiled once during the entire meal, and didn't offer any suggestions, and it took a for him forever to even come over and take our drink orders when we first arrived. Come to think of it the service was slow the whole night.\n\nI won't complain about my meal because out of the three it was by far the best. I got the fish and chips and it was really good, and a huge serving. There were three cod fillets and a large helping of fries. The tarter sauce was probably the best I've ever had. That being said my mom ordered the scallops, and the presentation was awful. They brought it out in a large bowl probably three sizes too big for the amount of food that was in it. There were only five scallops sitting in a broth with carrots. No presentation at all, and for the price of that meal with absolutely no side included it was far from worth it.\n\nMy brother ordered the lamb burger and fries, and his serving of fries was about half as much as I got, which was a little confusing. The burger had too many flavors that did not mesh well together. The menu selection didn't offer enough choices in terms of meat, there was only once chicken dish. The drink menu was pretty good, but they were all pretty pricey, and for the amount of wine my mom got in her first glass it was not worth the price at all, I think it counted as \"half a glass of wine\" so it should have been half the price.\n\nThe interior was very nice and very \"British.\" Our chairs were arm chairs that you would normally think of for a restaurant but they were very comfortable and made waiting for our food relaxing. All in all I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone, there are so many better places to eat on the strip."

We sat on the pub side and we were not even offered to look at the pub menu. It wasn't until we ordered that I realized there was a second menu. We both chose the fish and chips. Greasy thick batter on flavorless fish. Chips were these thick cut and I don't mean steak like fries, I mean these block rectangular potatoes with no seasoning.  If you want fish and chips go to his steakhouse at Paris!!!  Also, the place just opened and Vegas was packed but this place was half empty at 9 pm.  Lousy vibe and music. The only positive were the cocktails.  Much better choices in Vegas."

My boyfriend he is a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen so I picked this place since it was open for lunch. The decor was really fun and it had a British punk vibe. Our server was incredible sweet and nice.\n\nMain lobster roll appetizer - two mini Lobster rolls, kinda felt like what sliders are to hamburgers. Very delicious and buttery.\n\nFish and chips with mashed peas - my boyfriend loves fish and chips so he ordered this classic. He isn't a huge fan of tartar sauce but really liked the kind served here, it was so fluffy like butter! The mashed peas were a surprise hit for him, since stateside they do not serve mashed peas. they really paired well with the giant pieces of fish.\n\nRib eye steak - it was good, but a little oversalted for me. I thought about sending it back but it was still decent and I was lazy and didn't want to bother. I was also hungry. The bearnaise sauce was good but too rich to go along. I wish I got a different sauce. It was served simply with asparagus. Not sure if I would pay $45 for it. Eh, I probably should have sent it back.\n\nSticky toffee pudding - my first time trying this! It was sickly sweet but delicious. The caramel topping had a deep flavor that added to the decadence of the cake. It reminds me of a very moist cake. You can taste the dates in it, but it's well blended, no chunks of dates it's just a well soaked cake. If you have a sweet tooth I wouldn't skip it. Sugar load in the best way!\n\nAll in all we had a good experience, I would round to 3.5 stars but rounded down due to my indifference about the steak. Should have been perfectly seasoned for $45,"

The restaurant is located in Caesars directly across from the Colosseum. However, it ended up working out wonderfully. We were a group of 30 and the waitresses took superb care of us! The three of them were constantly making sure everyone had drinks and that the food was replenished accordingly. With the pre-set group menu we had the sliders, nachos, fire wings, pigs in a blanket and shrimp. Everyone loved the food, I heard various comments that it was all excellent. \n\nThe management staff was great as well, very helpful and nice. Everyone took such great care of us!"

            "review": "So you would think a very public british chef that makes a tv career reforming failing restaurants with \"Kitchen Nightmares\" or spends his time mentoring (read: for the most part screaming at and using a marine sergeants approach in the kitchen) up and coming chefs would really have a venue baring his name locked down tight.\n\nSadly no. Just no. In fact \"HELL NO\".\n\nI came in with a group of 5 people to celebrate a birthday and try an early dinner since the latest winner of Hell's Kitchen had arrived 2 weeks ago. From my experience I feel like a bad friend for suggesting the place.\n\nReally when you goto a restaurant there are 3 different things that you rate the place by: atmosphere (looks), food, and service. You measure your expectations of these things by location, chef, and price. So lets run down the list shall we?\n\nThe place itself is on the main casino floor of caesars casino and they had a great time decorating it with a lot of british pub flair that still is up beat and modern looking. So really they nailed it here. The bar area is very inviting and tvs on the walls make it comfy and the restaurant area is equally inviting. \n\nThe problem of course is when you go to order the actual food. As I said we came in for an early dinner (6pm) so the venue was fully staffed and maybe only 20% full with patrons. This should be an easy task for the staff. But, my experience rendered that assumption otherwise. To be fair our waiter was extremely up beat and full of suggestions and we were sat quite quickly so I can put most of the onus of service issues on back of house. But upon ordering it took almost 30 minutes for the table to get their alcoholic drinks. That just doesn't ring well with anyone. Especially a group of people that are in the mood to celebrate. Whats even worse is the food took well over 40 min before appetizers and starters came out with one of the more attentive managers checking in on us the entire time being very shocked that food was moving so slow that I could have walked into the mall, ordered food at any other place, taken it to go, and eaten it before our starters came out. \n\nSo lets talk about whats really most important, the food! Since we were in a group of mixed friends that all love to eat we kind of did a one of everything approach to our starters and shared whatever came out. This would be cool if there was some hit or misses but, in our case the entire table just got more disheartened right up front after the long wait which is kind of a great way to crush the excitement and spirits of your guests prior to the main course I guess. The sliders were way over cooked, the fried calamari was bland, the scotch egg was downright forgettable, the toad in the hole should have stayed in whatever hole it came from as it was absent of any real flavor, and the lobster roll had an odd after taste to it (more on this later). The only positives here were the fries and the lollipop wings. In fact we scarfed the fries because they were the only thing stood out as not just edible but tasty with the included aioli. \n\nSo lets say if you order starters the only thing nearly worth while are the fries. From a british gastropub? Wrong on so many levels.\n\nSo now lets move onto the main course. Something you would want to do in a decent time after the first round of food. But, the kitchen staff had the idea of letting us wait till we were really hungry for it before serving it. Yes I am being sarcastic, no it wasn't cool, and as you can guess it was far from worth the wait. So the main course comes after 2 more rounds of drinks that took to long and a manger was still \"shocked\" at the food service time. If you're counting at home do the math and you can see this is entirely too long. The next round of food included the wedge salad that wasn't even a wedge and the dressing didn't even have the right to call itself Bleu Cheese as it lacked any flavor and was so watery we wondered what the dressing did to offend the chef, the scallops that hey were cooked perfectly yet lacked any trace of seasoning, the lobster mac & cheese that we all agreed should have skipped the lobster, the chicken pot pie with a perfect crust yet lacked any flavor from the inside ingredients and the short rib that was so unbelievably void of the texture and flavor that it was sent back with the question of why a place like this would serve something that is supposed to be flavorful and tender but comes off like a bad croc pot version of pot roast. The one shining positive was the BLT which we all agreed just nailed it.\n\nSo after trying almost half the menu we are left with fries and the BLT being the only things that are positive standouts? At this price point?!?!? Are you kidding me? \n\nWhen it comes to dessert the sticky toffee pudding was however to die for. \n\nOh remember the lobster? Yeah all 3 people that had it felt slightly ill after. This place is a kitchen nightmare. Such a let down and a terrible experience."

Waiter came up to us with nerves and indescribable expressing in his face, right away he handed us the touch pad menu(drink) and the rest of the menu and said that he was really sorry for the wait around here. It's alright we said, and let him started the explanation for the menu.\n\nWe soon decided to order the Shepard pie, braised beef(forgot the full name) and lamb burger(medium with goat cheese). Check around the drink menu I then decided to have a glass of organic apple cider to go with my lamb burger, which turned out to be a perfect pair. Friend ordered the pear cider and was pretty good as well, for $9/glass there were no complains. \n\nAfter ordering our foods and drinks, my friend noticed that the other tables received their complimentary breads which i thought we have to place an order on but should be giving first thing as seated along with waters, we then call the waiter once again, and he responded to us like he knew exactly what we were going to ask before we even said anything.... that was weird to me, if he knew what we've been waiting, how come we were still seeing tables after tables came in after us getting their breads before we even did. I believe that's when a table got totally left out and poor coordination with the front house. Not to mention there were this suited guy who seemed to be the manager that's warmly welcoming the other tables and have couple eye contacts with me but never crossed his mind that he might want to check on our table and see if there are anything he can help us with. \n\nI've been as a waitress once, I understand the struggle working as one as a start-up and if that's what happened on that day on the guy who served us, I'm more than understandable, but seemed to me, there are really little support by the management around the front house anyway, that's a shame as my first GR's dining experience.\n\nThe part with foods were great, all of the orders were wonderful except my lamb burger tasted burned a bit, and it was too dark in the dining room that I wasn't able to identify the surface of the burger before my first bite. As I made my complain to the waiter, he told me this is grilled and can't avoid the burn on top of the surface. I told him I'm fully aware of that but this is just too burned for me to bare. He accepted the plate and turn it back to the kitchen. I have not gotten the order until everyone else finished with their orders, but it was worth the wait, second time's a charmed... I loved everything about that lamb burger and the goat cheese has given the burger even better flavor than it already were.\n\nShepard pie was satisfying, my boy friend was aiming for this order before we came and was pleased. Braised beef was cooked beautifully and flawless, any more words would be over analyzed. \n\nOverall we've had a great time enjoying ourselves, if only the service can be a little bit more careful. Will return for a second try for sure."

If you're looking for a fine dining experience, get a bottle of meritage and the veal chop. If you want a beer and some fish and chips, they can do that too.\n\nSpeaking of fish and chips, they were phenomenal. Fat pieces of cod, seasoned perfectly, coated in boddingtons beer batter and fried to a perfect crispness. The homemade chips are tossed in herbs and Parmesan. Ask for a side of garlic aioli to dip them in. It's a revelation. But honestly, the best thing on that plate were the bright green and buttery mushy peas. They had such a beautiful freshness to them and really tasted like...well...peas! But the best peas you've ever had.\n\nWe also had the shepherds pie. Down home goodness with a British flair. The use of lamb along with beef adds such a depth of flavor. Also, instead of using ground meat, the chefs braise it, so you get a nice stew like texture and flavor galore. The potatoes were creamy and rich and the vegetables inside were a perfect al dente.\n\nWe finished this feast with the sticky toffee pudding. Just get it. You are missing something divine if you don't.\n\nOur server, Elyse, was kind, quick witted and on top of it. She anticipated our every whim.

You want to be in and out and on the way to the tables, clubs, shows, or whatever else you're planning on doing.

After she finally made an appearance, service speed improved but when it came time to pay, we had to wait again. After giving her my credit card, it took her nearly 15 minutes to bring it back.

Especially  on the dinning room side. March madness bs didn't help either. We had a female server come to our table on 2 occations with dishes that were not ours and she seemed completely lost. We also over heard two waiters standing directly behind me talking about rude customers. They very well might be rude but talk in the back. \n\nOverall we might go again but then again for the price it makes it hard to be a favorite."

The food was tasty enough, but not crave-worthy or exceptional.\n\nThe ambiance is upscale pub. Overall, it's got a nice vibe.\n\nThe beer list didn't do much for me as there wasn't anything particularly notable. But all the standard ones you'd expect at a pub are there.\n\nWe ordered the calamari, fish and chips, English ale onion soup, and lobster mac 'n' cheese. Our server somehow forgot the lobster mac 'n' cheese and brought us fries instead. She promptly fixed the error, leaving the fries and putting in an order for the lobster mac 'n' cheese. But then she added the fries to our bill! Seriously. \n\nThe calamari was alright. Good enough to eat when you're hungry. Not good enough to ever order again. The fish and chips were good. They're fish and chips - nothing particularly notable, but the fish was battered and fried well. The English ale soup was quite tasty and the best thing of the night. The fries were alright. Would never actually order them. The lobster mac 'n' cheese was tasty. But I've had far better elsewhere and probably wouldn't order it again here given the price for the small portion.\n\nAside from the order mix-up, we had a pleasant evening here. It's a perfectly fine place. Good enough food, but not the wow food that one often comes to expect of Vegas dining."

Never brought one beer then she brought it and another server brought one (not as sweet as it sounds...all got added to the bill LOL!) But she did smile the whole time. Frustrating but still fun. Believe it or not, we would go back! Burger was da bomb! The fries were totally unique...\"I only had 4 fries\" but they were 4 fries on steroids...more than enough!

I also got the soft pretzels, which were how you'd expect soft pretzels to be, and a burger. The service and the drink really gave this place four stars - he constantly checked up on us and helped us charge it to our room in Paris when someone at the concierge made a mistake on the name of the room.\n\nThe burger was really dry so minus .5 stars and the hostesses outfits were nauseating so minus another .5 stars.

The decor tries to be an english pub, but ends up with a lot of low arm chairs that make eating uncomfortable.  Really it's an American interpretation of a UK pub and is hardly authentic despite the authentic name.  The food was boring and underwhelming, certainly not inedible but disappointing for the price, and doubly disappointing given the name.

No tables and the hostess said they basically wouldn't have any tables available for the rest of the night - so luckily we found two spots at the bar. We shared the Scotch Eggs, Lobster Rolls and Fish and Chips. Everything was just OK - I was expecting more from Gordon Ramsay!!! The Scotch Egg was basically just one egg, cut in two. At most pubs, when you order Scotch eggs, you usually get at least two eggs - for half the price of what we paid for this one. As far as taste, it was just OK - they put some kind of sauce on it that was almost a little too much. The lobster rolls were pretty flavorless, in hindsight I'm not even sure why we ordered them. I guess it sounded good at the time. The fish and chips was the best thing we ordered - and also the most expensive fish and chips I've ever had. The fish was actually the best thing - the chips were just mediocre. The fish was really good though - and the tartar sauce was tasty. Also, they close at 11:00, which was weird to me for a pub in Vegas. I definitely won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to others. So many better places to eat in Vegas!!"

We had to cool our heels 15 minutes because they do not accept walk up business! I suppose this keeps out the riff-raff but it also keeps out customers. The bimbo squad that act as greeters/seaters are just that - bimbos. Fairly attractive and none too smart or just not well trained. Or both. The drink menu is presented to you on an iPad but the size of drink involved and the pricing does not match what they offer you! Attempted an $8.75 25oz. Newcastle draft off the iPad but could only order a pint at $7.75! Pints were not even on the iPad menu! They mention that this is a 'craft' beer place but it must be relegated to the bottled section as the draft selection is pretty pedestrian. Did I mention the food is outstanding? No doubt, this is what kept this at a 4-star rating. But they serve the entrees in a plate that is almost like a bowl. This makes cutting meat a bit of a challenge. The 2-seat tables are pretty small with little room to manage all the glasses, bread plates, raised wooded placemats, etc AND the freaking iPad. Service was decent by the wait staff. The decor does not match the hype. It is pretty boring and almost ugly unless half-kegs of beer as wall art is your thing. From place settings to 'reservation only' seating this is as far from a friendly, down-to-earth pub as one can imagine. I suspect Gordon Ramsay was involved in the menu and the overall licensing of his name/image and that is about it as part of his overall Harrah's deal. This location in Caesar's was Bradley Ogden's which was an overall brilliant restaurant across the board. Too bad it was replaced with this - which boasts as friendly and inviting but really isn't. But this is all about the food and the food is OUTSTANDING. Just don't expect a Michelin experience."

            "review": "We ate here on the 21st and 22nd, 3 days after the opening on the 18th.  Both times we ate at the bar, so can't comment on the restaurant side.\n\nFirst night we came for drinks and a snack.  We had the Vic Queen Chips and Deviled Eggs.  Both were excellent.  The Chips were very delicate - thinly cut and perfectly fried - served with a side of malt vinegar for dipping.  Just excellent!!  The Deviled Eggs were served in an interesting way.  The egg whites were served separately, sprinkled with parsley, and the yolks were served in a small cup for you to scoop out and put as much as you wanted into the egg whites. The yolks were smashed and mixed with smokey bacon and cheese.   They were by far the best deviled eggs I have ever had.  In all, this experience was 5 star.\n\nThe second night we came shortly after 5 PM for the dinner menu.  We again sat at the bar.  They were out of the first beer that I ordered, but offered me a sample of another beer that I might like.  The bartender was very helpful.  We ordered the Fish & Chips.  It took about 25 minutes for us to get our food, which is a little long, but we thought it might be due to a lot of folks ordering right around 5 PM when they start the dinner menu.  I figured if anyone could do fish & chips right it would be Gordon Ramsay - however, I was disappointed in this meal.  It was definitely not the best fish & chips that I had ever had.  The fish was OK, the batter was really good, but the fish was a little dry & tough - like it had been overcooked.  I prefer fish that is more moist and flaky.  A thicker piece of fish would probably have held up better to the cooking.  The potatoes were the biggest disappointment, though.  We expected chips (french fries) what we got were big blocks of potatoes - hand cut in rectangles - which had been boiled and baked and fried into a state of blandness that I would never expect from a Gordon Ramsay product.  They were hard at the ends, like they had been overdone.  They were not seasoned at all - no salt when they were removed from the deep fryer - and no flavor at all.  However, the mushy peas were outstanding!!!  I have never really liked mushy peas - I mean, really, who would like anything called mushy peas?  However, this was a combination of whole baby peas and mushy peas with some seasoning that had me eating the entire portion (a first for me.)\n\nIn general the bartenders were very helpful and friendly.  Would have been nice had someone checked on our dinner and let us know the status when we went so long without getting our meal, but that's a small point.\n\nI liked the decorations.  It's pretty noisy with music playing but not so much that we couldn't hear each other or talk to the people next to us.  It was pretty busy for 5 PM.  Probably even busier later on.\n\nI would go again, but not for the Fish & Chips - definitely for the Deviled Eggs though."

He was also personable a friendly, and I appreciated his interest in what I thought of each dish.\n\nThe Shepherd's pie was good after adding a bit of salt and pepper. Made of ground lamb, carrots and peas in a mild sauce, it came piped on top with creamy mashed potatoes. As a basic meat and potatoes type of dish, it was filling, however, I do not think I will order it again, as, to me, there just was not a lot of flavour going on in the dish. I think next time I will try the Ramsay signature fish and chips.\n\nI decided to order the sticky toffee for dessert, as I had heard so much about it.., and Wow! Was it ever good!\nIt was so creamy and delicious with a moist date cake base, topped with a sweet cream ice cream and Florentine cookie, that I almost wanted to order another.\n\nAdam came table side, and slowly drizzled the luscious warm toffee syrup over the top. This dessert together with rich hot coffee, was such a perfect ending to a tasty adventure in Gordon Ramsay's Grill and Pub!"

Enormous space packed with unsuspecting diners, a cautiously daring menu, an army of impersonal wait staff buzzing to and fro, European sports on surrounding flat screens--everything about this place feels like it was washed through a series of trend spotting gastro-bots. But at least you get to wait way too long for your food, and as a special feature it's all ridiculously over priced. A pint of bass will run you ten dollars. Ten. Dollars. For a pint. Of Bass. Let that sink in. Two of us ordered fish and chips and one went with hangar steak, all served with French fries. Thirty minutes later plates arrived with luke warm, flaccid fries and serviceable proteins. The fish is substantial yet flaky and comes with a tarragon tartar which is a nice touch, but the whole thing lacks any kind of contrast in flavor or texture. Hangar steak was cooked properly, end of story. Hardly deserving its thirty dollar price tag. The table shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which I have read much about. Moist cake, small scoop of generic vanilla ice cream, and standard warm toffee--enjoyable, but unexceptional. Overall, the \"pub\" fails miserably for how much it promises yet doesn't even attempt to deliver. More proof of the inherent evils of scaling ever upward. Everything about this place, the size, the insane prices, the vague service, the thoughtless dishes, exists merely to support its own fat, bloated fanny."

There was a definate lack of Management on my visit.  \nA pint of draft IPA $13, I could buy a 6-pack of this beer for $10.\nCheeseburger and fries $19. I would rather have a 5-Guys burger with it's better tasting meat and many toppings and bigger, better tasting fries all for half of the price.\nI just can't believe that Chef Ramsay has tasted and approved of this food. But after eating at his namesake Gordon Ramsay Restaurant at the London Hotel in Hollywood (Restaurant has closed) maybe he has found a way to make money on hipe alone. \nSo everyone, don't waste your money here. I guarantee you that if you order the cheeseburger at the hotel coffee shop you will be eating better than at GR Pub and Grill.\nSomeone conduct this burger challenge and post your results on Yelp.

I was waiting to hear yelling and screaming from Chef Ramsay from the kitchen.\n\nMy cousin wanted to dine here before we proceeded with his bachelor party evening. We didn't make reservations here, so we ended up with a wait of forty five minute to an hour. When the estimated seating time came, we were seated promptly. While browsing our menus, our drink orders were taken and water glasses filled. I was very anxious and excited to try Chef Ramsay's favorite dish, beef wellington. Apparently, it wasn't on the menu. So, I ended up getting the roast prime rib entree, medium rare.\n\nAfter twenty minutes had passed, we were told our entrees would be out in five minutes. Then ten, fifteen, and thirty came and went. Still, no signs of our entrees. Yet, other customers who were seated after us had their entrees served. We were all ready to get up and leave and dine else where. But, we all just decided to stick it through. Once our entrees were being served, they were served in waves. I was the last one in our party of seven to receive my entree.\n\nFor a $40 entree, I'll admit the entree looked hearty. The prime rib was cooked to a medium rare and accompanied with some glazed baby carrots, brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. I had a side of creamy horseradish sauce, but no au jus for dipping. I would say that the prime rib was comparable to other dining establishments in Vegas. I would've been better off with the $10 prime rib dinners and paid way less than $40. But, I guess it was for the name and experience, right?\n\nAt the conclusion of our meal, my cousin went to place a complaint regarding our dinner service.

I'm 5'1\" so you can imagine that I simply had to slide the food in a straight line directly from the plate to my mouth. \n\nWe started with the Ramsay Tonic & a Moscow Mule. Both were just okay. My Moscow Mule tasted mostly of lime, and my husband didn't even finish his drink. The calamari was also just okay. It wasn't crispy, almost chewy, although it was seasoned well. And they served it with tartar sauce and ketchup. Ketchup...? \n\nHusband ordered the Fish & Chips, and I got the Braised Short Rib. The chips (or wedge fries) that came with his were seriously under-seasoned and slightly under-cooked. My Short Rib was the highlight--it nearly melted apart before my fork even touched it. The potato pur\u00e9e was tasty & smooth. Small sad face: the three carrots were still raw. Then came the Sticky Toffee Pudding. We've been obsessed with it ever since our first visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak. This one tasted great, but it didn't have the same sticky consistency I love about the one you can get at Steak. This was more like a cake.\n\nThe least desirable part of the whole experience was the service. The hostess was cold and didn't even look at me. However, the hostess assistant that sat us was friendly and engaging. Our server was fine but insincere. When he came to take our entree order, he just approached the table and stood there looking at us expectantly. I had to say, \"I think we're ready to order,\" just to break the awkward silence. Again, he was fine; I wouldn't classify it as rude. Just not attentive or warm.\n\nOverall, we had a decent experience. Looking back, I would rather have spent our 7-year anniversary and hard earned money at Steak again because the pricing is nearly the same, and the experience at Steak is significantly better."

They served is cold nachos, undercooked and cold sliders and then one burger had a hair in it. The atmosphere was fun and our server was good, but not great. The other items were okay but not worth the $20 per appetizer that we paid. Don't go. Go somewhere else. There are just too many places in Vegas you can spend your money! Like Bobby's burger palace near cvs and Monte Carlo. Much better and only about $10 for a burger!"

We also ordered the pretzel starter, and there was no warning on how hot the mustard was! I love heat in a dish, but there should have been some warning. I dunked that sucker all the way in not realizing that it would take my breath away. It came with 3 under seasoned pretzel sticks, and the cheese sauce was nearly tasteless. \n\nMy pulled chicken sandwich came out soggy from the kitchen. The over application of cheese and sauce created a gooey sandwich I was not expecting; The ciabatta bread did not hold up. If they had grilled it on a panini press, it would have been a different story!\n\nI had a few bites of my boyfriend's fish and chips. It was better than my sandwich, but there was no seasoning.

We asked for lemon with our water on the first and infrequent visit by our server and asked again at water delivery only to wait 10 minutes more. My wife is pregnant and when ordering a lemonade he actually chuckled. Entrees arrived and the server was no where to be found to see if we had what we needed. Turns out my steak wasn't delivered with a steak knife so I asked the guy who I'd seen make 4 rounds and figured was the manager, even though he never actually talked to any of the tables, for a knife since I couldn't seem to find my actual server. 5 minutes later I had what I needed to eat my meal. No doubt that the lack of service starts at the top. \n\nLike I said, food was ok, but way overshadowed by the lack of service. I would figure that a Ramsey restaurant would pride themselves on that front but i figure Gordon is too busy with TV shows and opening a plethora of joints while his stock is worth anything. Great corn soup with crab, smashed fingerlings are awesome, just wish the staff wasn't disaffected like their attire."

First off there was 5 of us and the hostess said 30 minutes. 15 minutes later I went up and told her it will only be 4 people now so she said ok it will be 20 minutes more. My other friend came up to her at the 20 minute mark and said are we next it's 4 people and she said oh it's only 4 people okay give us 10 minutes. Finally, we got sat to a 7 top table and we said there's only 4 of us and she said oh opps sorry and we asked for a smaller table so we could actually communicate instead of yelling across from each other at the table. We ordered are appetizers and we got everything but our pretzels. It took 20 minutes for them to send out the pretzels. We ordered alcohol and one of the beers was not what we ordered and we wanted chilled glasses. It took another 20 minutes to get it and glasses weren't chilled. 45 minutes later we get our entrees and their luke warm not hot. I've never had such bad service of such plain jane food. Our server seemed lost but he was nice and actually admitted that he didn't provide great service but I give him credit for being honest. The only positive is the manager comped our meal and that was very kind of her. Hopefully they will work out the tweaks and maybe I will return since I do enjoy Gordan Ramsay steak at Paris.\n\nPROS: Price, service, unorganized, food, communication\nCONS: Ambiance, decor, cocktails"

About 10 minutes later, our waiter showed up for the first time to take drink orders.  By that time, we had already decided what we wanted for dinner.  Another 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with water and took our order.  Our appetizers arrive about 10 minutes later and the food was excellent.  \n\nNow for the not-so-excellent part.\n\nAfter we finished our appetizers, we waited an additional 40 minutes before I started trying to find our waiter and ask him where our food was.  We noticed several other groups of people come in and get their entrees less than 20 minutes after they were seated.  Once I finally found him, he said he would check on it, and returned 5 minutes later with \"You food is next up, I just checked\".  20 minutes later, I was ready to leave and got up to find our waiter for the bill. I tracked him down again, and reminded him that we'd been there for almost 1.5 hours.  He gave me the look, then disappeared.  Another 5 minutes goes by, and finally our food shows up, right as we were about to bail.\n\nThe food was hot, outstanding and completely awesome.  It just took forever to get for some unknown reason, and I don't need to tell you how frustrating it was to watch people come in 10 minutes after you, get the same food you ordered, finish their meal and then leave, all before your food shows up.  Even though it was completely awkward, our waiter did apologize for the delays, but made no effort whatsoever to make it right.  No manager, no reasonable explanation, nothing.  Just a $144 bill.  It took us less than 15 minutes to eat the food that took them more than an hour to prepare.\n\nSo, the food was awesome, but the service was absolutely awful.  It was actually like participating in an episode of Hell's Kitchen, wondering if you'll ever actually get the food you ordered.  Except in this case, we got the \"pleasure\" of paying $144 for \"participating\" in this rather disappointing episode.\n\nGordon Ramsey seriously needs to tune this place.  Incredible food coupled with incredibly awful service essentially equals an awful experience.\n\nWith so many other awesome choices available for an outstanding dinner, I absolutely cannot recommend this place.  Even though the food was outstanding, we still left disappointed, and no one should pay $144 to come out of a restaurant disappointed.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCorn Soup\nEnglish Ale Onion Soup\nSheppard's Pie\nFilet Mixed Grill\nFish'n Chips\n\nNOTE: The Sheppard's Pie was the best we've had EVER."

The rice was tender and well-cooked, but so drenched in butter that it appeared yellow. Other friends ordered fish and chips, the pea soup, the sliders, and fries. The fries were soggy and limp, which was a huge letdown. Everything was else was fine, just nothing to write home about.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun, but that was probably the best part."

We were seated very quickly and was greeted immediately by our server, Yaneisy. She quickly brought us a round of drinks and added a couple of glasses of water. The mad Russian had Mule's Hind Leg and I chose Goodbye Blue Sky. Both drinks were good and refreshing.\nFor food, we had a classic bar menu taste in our mouths and ordered Nachos, deviled eggs, and Fish and Chips. The food came out hot and was well presented. The order of nachos was large and the fish was well cooked. No complaints about either the food or the service.\nAll told, it was a good experience and we wouldn't shy away from coming back. Prices are a little steep, even for Vegas. $30 for fish and chips.... I don't mind spending money on a good meal, but let's keep it reasonable. Two drinks and bar food was $93. The reason for the three stars was not the service or the quality of the food, it's for the value of the whole meal. Seems to me that being in the center of a casino, and a winning brand, ought to make it a volume restaurant, not a place to make a killing on low traffic.\nWe'd come back for sure as we had a nice meal and you won't regret coming here if you're hungry."

However, the menu choices and cooking execution is no where near what'd you imagine. \n\nLet's be real: it's a pub. And the menu greatly reflects that. I think I just hoped for a better culinary experience than traditional burgers and fries or a turkey pesto on wheat. \n\nI will say that it was extremely nice that they seated a group of 5 right away without a reservation, considering that's often a rarity on the Strip. But our food took over an hour and a half to come out, and our server seemed really flustered that we asked him to split the bill. \n\nI'll give Ramsey the benefit of the doubt; I'm certain he's an amazing chef. I just wish that he'd put some TLC into his restaurants. That's all."

Celebrity restaurants in Vegas are definitely hit or miss and while there were aspects of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill that were excellent, the service left something to be desired. First off -- since the service is what is giving this review poor marks let me start out by saying that our server had zero personality and was seldom seen or heard from. Service is the hallmark of a great restaurant, so even with the best food you can mess it up quickly with bad service. Our server should definitely find employment elsewhere. Now, on to the better part of the review - the food. The food was overall good. The short rib was extremely tender and tasty as it should be and it was atop an amazing risotto and the pearl onions were a very nice touch. The cheddar cauliflower was also very nicely done. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorite desserts and theirs was amazing. Cocktails were also great. Prices were high for what it is. I don't mind paying and you do expect to overpay on the strip, but this was a bit much. So, up the ante on service and you'd win me back -- not sure I'd give it another try based on what I experienced, however."

Pretzels were old tasting and dry. Beef sliders dry and over cooked. Deviled egg filling was very dry and not creamy in consistency; however the vinegar on egg white shells were good. We asked waitress if Mr. Ramsay was involved in restaurant operations and we were advised he most certainly is; however, it would be beneath him to consider \"amateur\" reviews on Yelp. Waitress indicated the people who work at restaurant are best equipped to know what's good versus customers. \n\nFirst visit occurred on 5-4-2014 with group of six. Service took 2 hours but food seemed better, lamb burger was reported by my table as delicious. I didn't order food but reserved my opportunity 3 days afterward.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars since the waitress' comments suggest there is no place in their business for customer feedback since owner is celebrity chef and has \"better things to do with his time than to look at Yelp or hear from amateur food critics.\"\n\nPlace is not worth the expense."

Was very friendly as well. \n\nApps we had the mini lobster rolls and the truffle chips. Lobster was very good. Chips were a waste of money. I'm sure my wife got them since a friend of hers got truffle popcorn at Hearthstone last week and they were awesome. \n\nI had read enough reviews to make me nervous of some items so I ordered a burger, my wife ordered the lamb burger and my buddy had salmon. The burger was excellent. My wife said her lamb burger was great. And, every bite was gone from my friends salmon so pretty sure he was happy. \n\nFor dessert we had to try it. We ordered the \"spotted dick\", jokes and all. It was excellent. Described by the waiter as similar to bread pudding but steamed. It came out, and was a warm sugary bread pudding in a liquor cream sauce with ice cream. It was surprisingly good. \n\nAll in all a very good meal. Good food, good service. Any complaints on price hasn't eaten on the strip. It was in line with anywhere else on the strip. At $80 a foot in rent and 10-25% of sales to boot going to landlord, what do you expect?"

When we asked the server, Tayler, why they are now charging for bread he said \" we are trying to run a business and people would come in, eat the free bread sticks and then leave\".  I stated maybe they should give the bread after the order is put in. He stated \"you know our rent is $250,000 per month\".  My thought, you can't argue with stupid. They also removed the truffled fingerling potatoes, that was my favorite, from the menu. We ordered fish and chips and sliders. The fish and Chips were $30 and are only average. When some of us were done with our subpar meal the bus boy began removing plates and reaching right over my plate as I was still attempting to eat. I suggested to him that maybe he should wait until we are all done.   Tayler, in all his brilliance, decided to come over and tell us that the bus boy was the best they had, blah,blah, blah. In a nutshell Gordon Ramsay needs to bring kitchen nightmares in to his own place and Tayler, you need to learn that the customer is always right and to shut your stupid mouth.  Skip this place Vegas is full of top notch restaurants fantastic food and stellar service."

Not a problem- they were able to seat us after a 10 minute wait. Unfortunately, after that we kept waiting. It took another 15 minutes to get water. 10 more minutes after that before our waitress arrived to take drink orders. We ended up placing our meal order at the same time, just to cut down on the delays.\n\nAs a starter, my son and I shared an order of the Warm Pretzels....which arrived stale and significantly less than warm. The accompanying cheese sauce was glorified velveeta. My entree, the Steak & Ale Pie was okay. The description said the pie contained \"root vegetables\" so I'd been eagerly anticipating a pie rich with steak, potatoes, parsnips, turnips...all those lovely British veg. But no...I got a basic stewed beef with a couple of sad little carrot bits, topped by a crust that left my mouth coated in lard/shortening film. \n\nMy spouse and son both ordered burgers and raved about them...but they both agreed that the fries reminded them of Burger King.

Kegs are used in lieu of wall separations and the table we were seated at was really \"homey\" This was my first Ramsey experience so I was anxious to see if his establishments could hold up to the cartoon scrutiny he puts the contestants through on his over wrought Hell's Kitchen show. Are his restaurants held to the same standard? I would have to say GRP&G is up to snuff. The menu is interesting but smallish even for a lunch but it certainly does not lack variety. Chicken pot pie and a beef pot pie are available as well as the expected Shepard's pie. .We saw several burgers being served and they were huge! Nice touch adding beer suggestions with each dish. I did not partake but thought the beer pairing idea was genius. We choose to start with a Scotch Egg that was delightful but the chipotle and mustard sauce took took it to another level, We also tried the shrimp cocktail that was ....a shrimp cocktail...Not bad,  just not special. I tried the braised beef rib and it was very good.It was served over a risotto (and no...I heard no screaming coming from the kitchen) that was nice. Desert however went to a new level of decadence.  A brownie, topped with cheesecake, topped with Rocky Road ice cream, covered in chocolate and to add to the party a magnificent caramel sauce on the side. No fellow Yelpers, this is not Gordon Ramsey light! Service was ...interesting. Good, fast, ..really spot on with the timing ....but...well..leave it to say our server was ....interesting. I've seen a few trash reviews here complaining about 12 dollar fish and chips? Come on ...it's a celebrity chef venue inside Caesar's Palace!  Were you looking for a Denny's? All in all a pretty nice experience and I would try dinner next time. ...If you do get the same sever we got ...and you will know if you do ...Let me know if the word interesting applies!"

The meat just juicy and savory, with just the right amount of gaminess to remind you that you are not eating a basic burger.  The goat cheese melded really well with the burger as well.  The french fries were thin and dull, and got cold pretty quick.  \n\nSo the lamb burger is a 4.5 star meal, while everything else was 2 stars, so I ended up giving the place 3 stars.  I was also disappointed that the lunch menu only had about 4 sandwich options."

More than satisfied!\n\nI wanted to try the poutine... but they were out :( Me sad.\n\nI ordered the fish and chips as an entree, and the table ordered the pretzels with cheese dip, deviled eggs, and sliders to share. I got to try every appetizer, and they were all delicious. Except the cheese was a little gritty. I like my cheese sauce smoother... but the flavor was pretty good.\n\nMy fish and chips were so good! Well, mostly the fish because the chips were big, fat potato pieces that are fried... pan fried? Haha I'm not a big fan of thick fries, I like them a little thinner and crispier. But the fish was flaky, crispy, moist, and fresh af. MMMMmmm and my bf ordered the pork belly.... omg............. It was SOO delicious. It's very rich, fatty, melty in your mouthy, and maybe a little too salty but overall it was really bomb. I don't think I could finish one by myself, so I'm glad I got to try his :)\n\nDESSERT: Sticky toffee pudding - ORDER IT! It's soooo decadent, warm, caramel-y, gooey, and sticky, and topped with ice cream = heaven."

No joke, everything we had here was amazing and the people that ate on both sides of our table couldn't stop talking about how great their food was.\n\nOur appetizer was the pretzels (so soft and you have to get it off the Pub Menu) with the housemade mustard and cheddar ale dip.  Then we got the bangers & mash (amazing), truffle mac & cheese (so good) and the sliders (on the Appetizer section of the Lunch Menu) which were so good because they were charbroiled.\n\nThe desserts we got were the pear cobbler and sweet cream (whipped cream) which were really good but the best part of the entire meal was the sticky toffee pudding.  When I said life changing I mean LIFE CHANGING!  I've never had anything like it and I'm pissed that I probably never will again!\n\nWe put in our reservations through Open Table and I'm glad that we did because there was a 30 minute wait.

Don't get me wrong, pretzels with cheddar beer sauce is *AMAZING* and the sauce actually was everything I was hoping it would be, it was just that the pretzels were lacking a bit of something, although I can't say exactly what.

We made reservations on Open Table and like any place on the Strip on a Sat night, reservations are key. I overheard the wait was 30 minutes but we were seated straight away, due to pre-planning.\n\nWe started off with the calamari which was fresh, crisp and had a hint of heat due to the peppers. They were served with two types of sauces, a tartar and cocktail. The serving was a good size as it allowed enough room for the main courses.\n\nI ordered the typical WWII patriotic English dish of Fish and chips. It was not served in newspaper, sorry folks. I was pleased to see the fish as one long piece which is typical in England. I've visited the UK about four times and when I order fish and chips it's always as long as my forearm. The fish at Gordon Ramsey was no exception. The chips were actually potato wedges and not your typical chips. I ate a few only because I don't eat a lot of potatoes, it's a personal thing :). It also came with a side of yummy mushy peas, another typical British accompaniment with fish and Chips. \n\nI highly recommend their sticky toffee pudding. For us Yanks, our pudding is different so don't expect the stuff you buy in cups and lick the lid. It's more of a sticky cake and served with a side of warm caramel and vanilla ice cream. It was sooooooooooooooo gooooooooood!!! Omg. It was moist, sweet, sticky and when you add caramel it takes it to a whole new dimension. \n\nSo to round it up, experiment and go with the British dishes.

When they mentioned that Beef Wellington was their special and that they only serve it about 10 times a year, I decided to order it knowing it's one of Gordon Ramsay's signature dishes.\n\nTime passed. More time passed. After 1 hour, 20 mins we asked where our food was. The server finally went to see and they came out with our food a while later. Come to find out later, they lost the ticket for our table and had to rush an order. Beef wellington typically takes 30-60 mins to make. The right thing for them to do would have been to come out and tell us what happened and ask if we wanted to wait for another hour for them to make it properly or give us the option of ordering something else. Did they do that? No. Instead, they rushed the order and overcooked the Beef Wellington. If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten it. It didn't have much flavor and it was really disappointing. Even the mashed potatoes was luke warm.\n\nThey ended up giving us 20% off and the manager came out and apologized. It wasn't enough to make up for it though.\n\nI'd like to think if Gordon Ramsay himself had been in the kitchen and see the mess, he would have screamed \"SHUT IT DOWN!\"."

In all fairness, I was overly excited for this opportunity owing to the fact that I have been watching Ramsey on a number of TV programs for some time, and he is hands down my favorite celebrity chef. That being said, I was a bit disappointed that after an hour long wait for a table, it took another ten minutes after being seated to even be approached by a waitress, upon which we finally received water and a drink menu. I had the scotch egg appetizer and the mussels and clams, both of which I thought were delicious. I was surprised by the heftiness of the mussel plate...I'm guessing there was at least 2 lbs. of shellfish on there. Overall, good pub food, but service needs a bit of work."

Its loud in the restaurant, so no need to worry about shouting.  Right after we were seated, 3 additional people joined us.

First of all the size and portions were super small. 4 super small pieces for an order that cost $9.  Second disappointment was in terms of flavor, it didn't wow me at all.  At other places I've gone this dish has been a hit and I think the missing ingredient is Goat Cheese.  It's not in it over here.\n\nHot lollipop wings (3/5 rating) - Northing extraordinary at all.  Just average. Lollipop wings so smaller in size as i expected.\n\nMini Lobster roll (4/5 rating) - This was my favorite part of my meal and I really enjoyed it. Plenty of Lobster and the quality of the roll was perfect."

            "review": "I go to Gordon Ramsey pub and grill with a friend for lunch. I order the grill beef burger and my friend order Caesar salad with chicken breast. I like my beef burger very much. The beef is soft but with a little crispy edge, very well grilled. It comes with French fries, ketchup and garlic creamy sauce on the side. I think the tasty level of the burger is around the same as holy chuck. So if u love holy chuck (like me!) you will love this place too. My friend's chicken breast is also very tender, not over cooked at all. Overall if only considering the taste I will give them 4 star. Why I give 5 star then? Their service is great! My friend thinks her salad has a little bit too much sauce which makes it taste a little too salty. The server insisted on change a new one for us even though we said it is ok. So the server gave us a new salad with all request my friend wanted. And then the floor manager came short afterwards to apologize for our \"unpleasant\" experience and offer to provide us a makeup desert (although we refused since we were reeeeeeeally full!). \n\nOverall, it's a great restaurant to try. We had a good time here!"

We were in Las Vegas for my sisters bachelorette party for the weekend, we went there for our last meal together. We had reservations for 9:15 and showed up at 9:10 and got seated immediately. Richard E was our server. He was fast about getting our drinks and complimentary bread and appetizers, but after that he rarely came to check our table. We waited well over an hour before our entrees came out. I confronted a bus boy about how long our food (because our waiter Richard E was nowhere to be found) was taking because we noticed a table of 4 that got seated at least 15-20 mins after us got served before us. He went in the back to check and came back telling me that the reason they got served first was because they have a smaller party and it takes longer for the kitchen to prepare all our meals to come out together....Once the food came out it was okay but definitely not worth the wait and rudeness we experienced. Richard brought one check over without asking us if we were all paying together at the end. We were a party of 8 so we asked if he could split the check for us and he made a huge deal about how long and difficult it would be for him to do it but he guessed he could. It took him 20 mins to do so..which we saw he had finished earlier and was waiting to bring us the split checks...Overall very disappointing for what we thought would be an amazing experience."

We shared the chopped salad, the tomato soup and the nachos.  The short rib on the chips was awesome, and the soup was really tasty as well.  We sat at the bar and I have to say Ray Ray was one of the nicest most genuine people we have come across in Vegas.  Total asset to the restaurant.  We are so pleased we stopped in. It is a bit pricey,  but not unreasonably so and the quality was there to back it up.  Ignore 3 star rating which I think is because some folks are hoping for food court pricing.  This is a fun, tasty experience.  We will be back."

We ordered and then it was about 50 minutes before the food came.  My friends order was wrong and they had to fire up a new meal for her which took another 12 minutes and came out cooked incorrectly.  I went with simple sides and they were ok - cauliflower au gratin, creamed spinach/kale, mashed potatoes and brussel  sprouts.  My other friend had shepherd's pie and said it was ok.  Based on the poor service, wrong orders, incorrect cooking of orders and that the food was just ok they're only getting 2 stars.

He called me by name but also just before we left, had his manager come over and introduce himself.  They both said \"Thank you for the business, not only today, but for all the business we bring to Las Vegas!\" It took me a minute to realize that he had coyly notice I work for the Las Vegas Convention Authority.  This experience with that kind of attention to detail and personal service, is what makes every visitor return home with a great story and attributes to making Las Vegas the number one tourist destination that it is!

We went into a nearly empty bar and sat at a table for two only to be chased away by a waiter who said tables weren't open seating. We should have left right there. Instead, we went and sat at the bar. I ordered a Goodbye Blue Sky and she ordered a Margarita. My drink was bitter and lacking in any other flavor. Hers was served in a small glass that was half filled with ice. There seemed to be very little alcohol in either. For this, we were charged $15 for each glass (one bad drink and one tiny one). I've paid more other places, but gotten more and better and I came away happy. The next night, we stopped by Numb instead. We had drinks that were better tasting, and stronger for less money. Don't go to Gordon Ramsay's!"

I was not let down, the food, service, and atmosphere was all top-notch!\n\nFirst - our server Rodney made it a great experience and the reason for the 5 star review!  He was good sport when I misheard his name, fixed our table when it wobbled, and provided personal recommendations.  He also shared some fun stories with us and talked about his background a bit.  What a great experience, he's definitely among the top servers I've experienced around the world!\n\nSecond - the food was tasty and well portioned.  We really enjoyed the side order of fingerling potatoes, VERY well seasoned and pancetta, yum!  My chopped salad was good and my colleague's fish & chips was described as \"very good!\"\n\nOverall - highly recommend, was fun to people watch in Caesar's Palace and the staff was all very friendly.

This happened to be one of those \"filler\" nights where I tagged along with what was fast and easy before a show.  I should have known better.\n\nListen, it would be far more difficult to skewer a place, if its owner and Executive Chef weren't on TV every other night berating contestants over one flaw or another while simultaneously puffing his chest and pimping his brand.  \n\nEither Gordon Ramsey has never eaten at Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill, or he's full of shit.\n\nFor starters, the place is so fully \"in the casino\" you can't really differentiate between the scent of the beer steamed clams, and the cigarette smoke wafting around you as you attempt to chew.\n\nOrdered the \"Calimari and Bacon Crackle\" for an app.  I'm not sure what exactly makes it part bacon, but I actually counted the pieces of finger-nail sized bacon in my cone of calamari and there were 4.  Besides marketing to a ravenous for all things pig consumer base, I can think of no worldly reason for the word \"Bacon\" to be in this dish.  The calamari were cooked well with utilitarian dipping sauces.\n\nSprang for the Herb Caesar Salad w/ Chicken for an entr\u00e9e in a feeble attempt to incorporate a vegetable into a meal during the stay.  I am not kidding when I say that Applebees serves a better chicken Caesar salad.  This salad is 23 dollars.  Twenty three dollars. The chicken breast (and I use that term loosely) that came on top had the texture somewhere between a tire and a silicone breast implant.  If it was not cooked via microwave I will literally give Gordon Ramsey the entirety of my craps earnings. This salad was atrocious.  Minimally dressed and lacking in every viable flavor that usually makes its way into a Caesar.\n\nService started out decently, but then we turned into an afterthought.  Cocktails were surprisingly good.\n\nThis takes me back to my opening sentence.  This experience has soiled me on the name Gordon Ramsey.  I have zero desire to ever set foot in another one of his establishments.  For every contestant on another one of his shows, please point to this restaurant when you get scolded on the inadequate ratio of crust to filling in your apple pie.  That is all."

Absolutely love the decor, ambiance, staff uniforms, flatware, dishware, etc.  Aesthetically it delivered, especially if you're looking for that \"adult theme park\" feel from Vegas.  Our server Scott was very knowledgeable and professional.  He did point out some menu errors prior to us ordering.  He did a great job considering that his section was full and he was managing relocating a large party due to a leak in the ceiling (it was raining and we know from first hand experience that these things happen...absolutely no big deal at all$ and he was so pro in managing his guests.  Kudos to Scott and staff.  Drinks were good and timely but our food took a loooooong time....especially for lunch.  A party of seven with two rounds of drinks, soup for two as a first course and salad and sandwiches for entrees took over two hours before we left. The menu selections really were well written and tempting but the actual food just lacked magic, flair and spark.  I will say that if I was able to eat red meat I would have sprung for the burger as those bad boys certainly looked good.  I ordered the chopped salad without salami.  It comes with pretzel croutons and they were not what I expected--stale, small and flavorless.  Dressing was good and the dish was well balanced, but just fell a little short compared the environs of the restaurant.  I'm not going to let this impact my opinion and image of Chef Ramsay as I know this is a watered down corporate version of his award winning creations.  No Michelin star here.  Just some Vegas grub.

Perhaps because it's Ramsey, and who hasn't watched his show, my expectations were higher than usual. \nOn the show he is a perfectionist, and expects that from his teams, and yes it's a show, but this resto has his name on it and it was not perfection. \nMy burger was not overwhelming or juicy or delicious. That's what I expected. The truffle chips were actually my favorite here. We did not order any of the British staples like fish n chips or shepherds pie, and that may have been what all the great reviews were for. All I know is I did some major walking and shopping at the Forum Shops in Ceasars so when I saw Gordon Ramseys pub I walked in. I had such a taste for a great burger which I did not get.\nAfter posting this review, a GM did message me and invited me to try them again.

I'm typically not a fan of mushy peas as you usually get so much in the UK, but the bartender assured me they would be on the side. \nThe food came rather quickly and was an average portion size - 2 pieces of fish and some fresh cut potato wedges as fries.

The fish and chips was well prepared and it was a very generous portion.  It was served with a rosemary tartar sauce and garlic mayo.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy top recommendation is that you absolutely cannot miss Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding.  It was so good that I'm going to plan to stop at this restaurant the next time I'm in town.  I was happy to find out that this dessert is a staple at most of his restaurants.  If you have the opportunity...get that dessert!  It's a warm toffee pudding - the consistency of bread pudding - and it's served with a hot caramel sauce and cream fraiche ice cream.  It isn't overly sweet and it's a very well balance mixed of flavors.\n\nNext time I come back, I really want to try their braised beef cheek sandwich and shepherd's pie.

Scott returned and said you are in luck the bread is available, \"why should I be in luck for an item listed on the menu\". I wish the bread was not available and that I could have chosen something else, the bread was so soggy from being placed on the flat top to toast the bread that the sandwich fell apart.  I had to eat the sandwich with a fork.  Also the ends of the bread were so hard it was not a pleasant experience.\n\nI returned to the restaurant again to give it a second chance. Normally I would not return but since it was located in the hotel I was staying at I decided to return.  It was dinner time and again I was disappointed. I sat at the bar this time to make the hostess job easy for them again 4 women standing at the podium. I witnessed the following from the bartender and others. The bartender after politely taking my order returned to the kitchen and returned with a cup of water melon as he ate it he did not was his hands that he used to stick it in his mouth. He also drank water from a huge water bottle at the bar. If that was not enough he continually checked his phone. As I waited for my food another employee stopped at the bar and informed the servers that the glass washer was not working. Some how he turned the conversation into I did not break the washer I washer I break hearts. Well this went on for a while and something I did not want to hear about after a long day sitting in a seminar.\n\nWell not the food came and again it was very greasy, I order a burger and should be juicy but not to the point that the bun fell apart. I do not mind spending my hard earned money but $37 with a tip for a glass of Stella that was not cold and cheeseburger with fries is crazy. I also paid $35 for lunch which was below my expectations for the Great Gordon establishment.  \n\nThere might be a reason why the restaurant was not busy both times I visited and hotel was sold out per the front desk."

The hostesses and waiters were all dressed in new paper costumes. \n\nFood \nFirst thing that came out was the hand made soft pretzel. The presentation was great  and it was good. I am not a big fan of pretzels but it was quite good. It came with a tray of spicy horse radish melted cheese and pub mustard or was it some sort of butter. \n\nPork Belly: \nThis was surprisingly pretty good. The flavor was delicious it had a fatty, crispy, and just enough salty flavor. I recommend this dish for those who are not afraid of a fatty dish. \n\nI ordered the Beef Cheek Stew. The meat was very tender and it melted nicely as it was in my salivating mouth. It was a bit on the salty side and it came with only four pieces of potato fries. I wish there was a little more starch in here to help balance the saltness. \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding: I read yelp reviews about this dessert and I am so glad that I ordered it because it was food orgasm in my mouth. It was a warm ooey gooeyyy toffee pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream YUMMAY. Highly recommend this. I would just come here just to eat this dessert again. \n\nOur server seemed to be tired or ready to clock out.

Because of the bad reviews my boyfriend said no, but I insisted.  The quality of the food is not up to par, but the prices were high.  We sent 2 out of the 5 things back and were still charged for the drink that we did not drink and sent back because it tasted bad.  The Mac and cheese was undercooked and also sent back.  After some argument about whether or not it was undercooked or just \"al dente\" with the waitstaff we felt so awful we wanted to just get out of there.  I know the difference between the two and felt insulted that they argued with me. We left and looked at the bill on our way out-- Unfortunately we were overcharged on our meal as well and had to go back for a $3 refund which was super emabarrasing and I wish we had just left with our dignity at a $3 loss instead.  The manager never came out to apologize for us having such a bad meal or being overcharged.  Even at low end restaurants they would do that.  Very disappointing.  We won't return."

We both loved the extensive amount of beers on tap!\n\nWe were served complimentary pretzel bread with a sharp cheddar cheese spread that I could have just eaten as my meal - Delish! Since it's pretty cold here right now I started with the english ale onion soup which was an even better version than french onion soup. It was rich and very filling. \n\nMy date had the pub beef burger with ginormous fries..I totally wanted what he had. Sadly, he demolished the whole plate so I didn't even get a taste but that's what I'm getting next time. \n\nThe server really sold us on the sticky toffee pudding with sweet cream ice cream.

We ordered the potato chips nachos (very good) to share and for my entree I ordered the Butter chicken curry with basmati rice and naan.  My entree was phenomenal and the portion was big.  My daughter and sister ordered the burger and that looked delicious.  We all agreed this was a good solid meal.  Drinks were also well crafted and executed.

Sister had the deviled eggs, I had the lamb burger, wife had the ale onion soup. All of which were perfect. \n\nI love lamb. You can say you love it more but I will disagree. I don't like the actual animal, I like the meat it gives. It's juicy. It has that remarkable taste. Leaves a taste that lingers in your mind.\n\nThis lamb was cooked perfectly. Great burger. Great price. You're in Vegas. It's in the middle of the dessert. Food isn't cheap. \n\nThe ale onion soup lived up to its name and tasted like ale reduction. A fun take on the French onion soup. \n\nService was FANTASTIC. I wish I could remember our waitress name but she was amazing.\n\nSide note: if you're the manager reading this, she had blonde hair and was stationed by the kitchen entrance that served the booth with 2 love seats, on 8/08 , around 4pm. Give her a high five. \n\n- not five stars because the food won't blow you away but it will get the job done right -"

After 2 bites we realize the mistake so we bring it to the attention of our server. She takes them in the back and reappeared 3 min later with new steaks. That was a little quick. The steak was cold. So we send it back. Now on our third steak I get a rare when I wanted medium well. Sooo back it goes on my fourth steak. My friend on his third. The other person at the table finished eating 20 min ago. Bill comes full price on all plates and drinks. Absolutely terrible service and food! Never eat here!"

I just returned since my first visit and unfortunately I can't give a rave review anymore. My sister's onion soup was delicious however at the bottom she found a little plastic surprise.  No good. Then our entrees came. She ordered the fish and chips.  The chips were stale,  not even warm. I had the Shepard' s pie.  Flavor was great however it wasn't heated all the way thru unfortunately.  I really wanted to like this place.  But between the very slow service and mediocre, overpriced food I will not return.  \"Damn, such a shame\" -Gordon Ramsay"

When I arrived at the Pub and Grill, I noticed that the establishment was extremely empty. I thought this was odd since it was New Years Eve and the strip was packed. the hostesses did offer an ala carte menu, as I was not interested in their main menu for the evening. The bar was open seating, so I decided to eat there since other establishments looked really busy.  My friend and I were hungry since we hadn't eaten in a while. At first the waitress seemed very friendly, and she offered us drinks. We ordered a pear ale, and it was very tasty. We didn't see the waitress for quite some time to order our meal. When she arrived, I ordered the sliders. When they arrived I was extremely disappointed. First of all, it took it seemed forever for the food to arrive. Secondly, the burgers were just buns and a burger no toppings. The buggers were the size of a quarter, they were extremely dry, and lacked taste. After visiting Gordon Ramsay's burgers we had very high expectations.  That establishment was phenomenal. Gordon Ramsay's burgers had a very friendly and helpful staff, and excellent, I repeat, excellent tasting food! The sliders that I received from the pub and grill were sub par. After I was finished with the disgusting sliders, I didn't see our waitress to receive our bill for more than 45 minutes. I even held my card up for at least a half an hour with no response. I would have spoken to the restaurant manager, however we were pressed for time for the firework show. I did write a note on the credit card receipt about how it did not compare to Gordon Ramsay burger, and that I was disappointed. To top it off, 20 percent gratuity was automatically charged to the bill. I did not feel that the waitress who neglected us deserved to receive 20 percent. I will not go back to this restaurant, and I will not recommend it to anyone I know. However, I highly recommend going to Gordon Ramsay's burgers!!!"

The ambiance and food was exemplary.  Yes I said it, my GOD I never had nothing that good not even a home cook meal from grandma house or momma house.  (smile)  However; that nite we had serve that was  not well but the night ended excellent.  2 of us had ceasar salad and the other young lady and the fish chips and it was divine.  Our waiter never check on us or even asked if we wanted any dessert.  Well we called the manager over and we just feel in love with his warmth and sincerity.  He was just a blast in which we could have stayed longer just talking about life and Mr. Gordon restaurant.  Then the bartender came over and grab my hand and we went to the kitchen and thats when I smiled from ear to ear seeing Mr. Scott  from hell kitchen  the man in action.  Oh my is the only thing I could think of at that moment. As if that wasn't enough Mr. Goldich invited us to come back as his guest the next day and it was a perfect fairy tale for us knowing it was our 1 and 2nd time there in vegas.  It was a perfect ending to a 2 day stay in vegas and we owe it to Gordon Ramsay and the staff.  Starting with Mr. Randy Goldich and the perfect hostess Saturday and Sunday nite and my bartenders Sauturday nite and finally to our server on Sunday.  Yes I forgot her name but she was beautiful and nice and absolutely a perfect waitress who take her job seriously.  Thank you to all and please know you made dreams real for three women from Detroit, Mi and Sacramento, Ca."

Cool mix of tables and sofas and loveseats. HUGE bar. We chose to sit at the bar (being the alcoholics we are) and the happy hour was kick ass. Probably 20 different beers and ciders. Prices on beers and appetizers were so affordable. The nachos here - oh my word - just try them. My boyfriend got them while I attempted a healthier option. Pretty sure I scarfed all his nachos when he got up to use the restroom. Talk about order regret.\n\nThe best part of our visit here was the bartender Ray Ray.  He's off on weekends, but if you are nearby during a weekday, look for a big friendly bartender named Ray. He anticipated our needs ahead of time, was personable and professional, and has years and years of experience in the service industry in Vegas. Would have loved to kick it at the bar with him all day.  He was equally as friendly and helpful with the other patrons at the bar as well."

I was thinking oh these will be regular bar pretzels. Oh Gordon Ramsey, the things you do! First, it comes with three different pretzels. The bacon pretzel is by far my favorite! The two sauces were also quite amazing! The mustard gave it a kick while the cheese was a nice finishing touch. \n\nFor our main meal, I ordered the Pub BLT (blt is my favorite meal at home) and my partner ordered the bangers and mash. After eating the Pub BLT, my homemade BLT will never be the same! The cheese bread was so light. The flavors and fillings of he sandwich were so perfect. I ate slow to savor every bite. The perfectly crisp chips that came with BLT were an amazing compliment for my dinner.  The bangers and mash was also amazing. It comes with three different sausages and the most amazing mash. \n\nThe only down side to our visit was our server, Scott. He seemed very disinterested in assisting us at all. Thankfully there was another server who came by a few times to make sure we were ok."

The lunch portion was perfect, for $17 I think. I came back during dinner and ordered it, and even though it wasn't listed on their dinner menu, they made it anyway and it was $14. The only suggestion I have is to just make the lunch size $14 as well because it seems ridiculous to charge more during the day, and not as much at night especially since you're making the same dish. But, the food was very delicious. Our service was great both times, and the decor is awesome. No complaints! \n\nI would highly recommend it, and if you go, you must get the truffle macaroni and cheese! It's perfectly creamy and scrumptious!"

I was expecting the portions to be on the smaller side and boy did they look small lol. It was a good thing I ordered a bunch of food, but surprisingly we both got full from our meal and even had some left over! The pie reminded me of a pot roast with big chunks of steak and mushroom. My favorite component was the crust on top and I wish they gave me more of it! The lobster rolls were also good and it was really fresh. The pesto Mac was my favorite since I love pesto while my brother (and the waitress) preferred the garlic Mac. The salmon bruschetta reminded me of the bologna lunchables for some reason haha. It wasn't bad, but not something I would order again.\n\nI will definitely be coming back to this place to try out some of their other items. As expected the place is a bit pricey, but you're paying for the name and atmosphere lol. Our lunch was about $70. Would recommend this place if you haven't been here yet!"

Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.\n\nThe Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.\n\nThe pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.\n\nFinally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!\n\nPassable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.\n\nThe dining space is contemporary with a Disneyland feel.  It's a pub by d\u00e9cor not by the vibe of the guest you expect from a crowded, boisterous, friendly pub.  \n\nIf you're wearing a t-shirt that says \"I love Las Vegas\" go right on in.

The hostess was in a conversation with some coworkers and never acknowledged us.  We waited a minute or two and then proceeded to the table where our friends were.  They were the only occupied table in the restaurant.  There were a few guests at the bar.  Our friends  had put in an order for some appetizers and drinks for themselves before we arrived.  A server brought water to our table but said he could not take our order as he was not our waiter.  Eventually a waiter came and took our drink order and to make a long story short, that was the last time we saw him at our table.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to come with anything but it did not happen. To pass the uncomfortable time, my husband and I walked to the poker room thinking that when we got back our order would be on the table.  It wasn't.  My husband went up to the bar to place the order with the bartender instead.  BIG mistake.  The bartender rolled his eyes and made it clear that this was an imposition.  We ended up canceling our order and asked to speak to the manager.  He was less interested and as rude as the bartender.  Gordon Ramsay has a reputation for perfection.  Clearly this establishment would not meet his expectations!  There are hundreds of amazing restaurants in Las Vegas! Don't wast your time here, go directly to The Palm Restaurant or Olives in Bellagio! You will be glad you did!"

I had the fish and chips. While I appreciated the nod toward Gordon Ramsay's heritage, there's really nothing authentic about the dish aside from the minted mushy peas. They tasted just like my grandma's peas (Which led to an awkward conversation with my dining companion when I accidentally let it slip that they tasted like \"her peas\").\n\nThe fish and chips weren't really like anything I've had in England. The batter was soggy inside/under-cooked, and the chips were potato wedges, also undercooked... And completely bland. They hadn't seen a bit of salt.\n\nOther things we tried were excellent, though.

Sat at a table in the bar for 10 minutes with the wait staff ignoring us. Finally flagged someone down to be told I can't sit there because it's not part of the bar. The bar starts 3 feet from the table. Went to the front to be told I would  have to wait 10 minutes for that table because its not wiped down. Finally took a table in the dining room only to wait another 5 minutes for the iPad so we can order drinks. The service is so poor, I don't really care how good the food is. I'm only staying because my wife wants to try it. I won't be back."

The drinks were expensive though, we each got one and decided to wait until after dinner to get more drinks elsewhere.

I actually came here twice. Once for a business dinner, which was good food and great service. We had reservations and were promptly seated. The waiters had interesting uniforms, especially the very well supporting women's dresses. We ended up having 5 instead of 4 halfway through our meal and were very pleased with the flexibility of the staff considering the stature of the restaurant and their relatively business and newness. Props to them for being extremely considerate.\n\nThe food was good, for being British. Admittedly, my opinion of British food has never been good or bad. Just mediocre. Gordon Ramsay's name on it makes me have naturally higher expectations. As expected, the menu is relatively small, but very selective.\n\nSince I had higher expectations, I can tell you that the food was good, but I wouldn't say it was amazing. I enjoyed eating here and so did all of the other people that came with me. We had a full course of appetizers, followed by entrees, and desserts.\n\nSo, I managed to get a full compliment of what the restaurant had to offer. After this visit, I went back with a few buddies after gambling at Caesar's and we just wanted to get drinks at the bar but they were 'too busy' to seat us so we actually stood at the bar waiting for somewhere to sit. We even had a waitress try to get one of the hostesses to seat us in one of the obviously empty tables, but they refused saying that they were booked. Needless to say, this part of my experience was a bit offsetting. In addition to that, we bartenders were a bit hissy when it came to asking to close the tab, which we found a bit odd. They seemed less than concerned to help us pay them.\n\nOverall, I would say my experience was pretty good and that I would come back, just not for the bar. Only for food/drinks if I have a reservation. Oh, and I loved the Corgi chair that I had been sitting in. I'll post a picture later."

We were all in the mood for some simple pub fare so after stepping off the elevators, we went straight to Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill.\n\nIt seems to be the perfect venue for sports fans as there were a myriad of TVs around the surrounding bar and dining room, with plenty of soccer (excuse me, \"football\") fans watching what seemed to be a fairly important match. Color me clueless because I can't watch a sport that doesn't count down to the end of a match or doesn't always end with a winner. But on to the food!\n\nWarm Salty Pretzels [$8 / $7 Total Rewards]\nInnis & Gunn Beer-Cheddar sauce, English granary mustard \n\nMake sure you get a Total Rewards card from Caesars because you get a dollar knocked off most menu items. We started off with the pretzels, which came warm and salty indeed. But fair warning, you only get three! The accompanying beer-cheddar sauce was nicely sharp with depth from the beer. The English granary mustard was great, with a sinus-clearing horseradish kick that was highly reminiscent of my favorite Holman's. \n\nDublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich [$18 / $17 Total Rewards]\nDark caraway rye, Gruyere cheese, sauerkraut, pickled onion and cucumber dressing\n\nThe corned beef brisket sandwich featured great rye, with a nice heft of corned beef brisket that was balanced by the tangy sauerkraut and pickled onion and cucumber dressing within. The Guyere imparted a nice nuttiness that melded the flavors together nicely.\n\nYorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips [$30 / $29 Total Rewards] \nCod, fresh dill tartar sauce, minted mushy peas, lemon\n\nThe fish and chips featured moist and flaky cod without its skin (luckily for the GF). The batter was crisp and light. The thick steak fried were not crisp, but came with more of a roasted texture. The minted mushy peas were light on mint and were a bit watery.\n\nGrilled Lamb Burger [$21 / $20 Total Rewards]\n8 oz, caramelized onions, goat cheese-feta spread, rosemary brioche bun\n\nI went with the stellar lamb burger, which was cooked to a nice medium and housed within a perfectly proportioned brioche bun. The grassiness of the lamb was accented by the goat-cheese and feta spread, with the caramelized onions adding a nice richness to each bite. \n\nSo if you're looking to indulge in proper gastropub fare while watching a game with some friends, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill will set you right."

Seriously ?\nFlowers ?  we've been together 3 years, I've yet to give her a flower so why start now.\nCandy ?  getting closer\n\nHow about two tickets to the Uncorked Dinner with Chef Gordon Ramsay since I think she loves him more than me ?  What can i say, I'm a giver.\n\nSo even though it's a special dinner, it is being prepared by the chefs that work at the pub and you figure, it's gotta be there best effort since Chef Ramsay is there riding their ass so i've opted to make this a review of the restaurant and not the event.\n\nbriefly, as to the event, they simply cut off a portion of the restaurant for about 60 diners.  Chef Ramsay made the rounds - pics autographs, etc.  My gf was gushing when he came up to our table - i jokingly told the chef he can grab my girls ass when i take the pic.  I gotta admit, the guy is personable - i couldn't resist - asked him about this so-called riff between him and Bobby Flay - to his credit, didn't miss a beat and explained that it's \"press-driven\" - he likes Bobby, thinks he's a great chef, blah blah blah.  Overall, A nice event.  What about the food ?\n\nAll the courses were paired with beers provided by Innis & Gunn\n\nCourse one -   Chilled Fennel Soup with Shrimp paired with I&G Original.  If I wasn't told it was fennel soup i never would have guessed fennel was in the soup and I'm a fennel fan !   Smooth, creamy, but it needs ... flava !  The beer was decent.\n\nCourse two - Heirloom Tomato. Goat Cheese and Chervil ( paired with Original again )  - believe it or not, the star of the evening - simple fresh the classic flavor explosion. \n\nCourse three - Pan seared Diver Scallops, braised artichokes, spring garlic ( paired with Original ) - nice, simple really like the artichokes.\n\nCourse four - Grilled Rack of Lamb, olive crushed potatoes, baby zucchini ( paired with I&G Finish ) - again, simple yet full of flavor and the beer was amazing.  The GF had a hard time with the rareness of the lamb - good, more for me !\n\nCourse five - Sticky toffee pudding ( matched with Melville fruit beer )  - for this being his \"signature\" dessert and i've seen rave reviews about it,  I can't lie - didn't care for it.  i actually was surprised what it looked like ( never had before ) - to me it looked and tasted like an upside down bran muffin.  I was expected a little jug of toffee sauce to pour over the muffin and ice cream - i guess not.  I simply didn't understand the dessert.  The beer had a fresh berry flavor to it - not bad, just not sure it complimented the dessert.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a decent effort with the theme being fresh, quality ingredients that were not stifled by seasoning.\n\nMost importantly, the GF was very pleased.\n\npics attached"

That really worked out well, first we got a text right away saying our estimated time, and about 30 minutes later we got a text our table was ready. Very cool to be able to do your own thing while you wait. \n\nSo overall the food is pretty good, however for the prices they charge it is not worth the value. We started by splitting a vegetable salad, and that was really good but the salad itself costs $16, way over priced. \n\nI had a steak which was pretty good, and my wife had the shepherds pie which is pretty similar in taste to Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding which was pretty good as well. \n\nAll in all the food was decent, but it just does not live up to value.

Although I don't find British food all that exciting, I had to give this place a try...why not?\n\nThe interior and decor were ok.  This is a pub so, it's not a place to take your date.  There's bread service of pretzels with butter and a cheddar spread.  It's about $20-30 per entree, $10+ for sides like English chips - depending on the menu (there's a pub menu and a grill menu).  \n\nWe wanted to try the duck confit poutine but unfortunately, they weren't available.  Such bad news.  So, we ordered truffle chips, short-rib and cheek sandwich, steak, pork belly, and cornish hen.  For dessert we had peanut butter and jelly, sticky toffee pudding, butterscotch pot de creme and potted triple chocolate trifle.  Nothing exciting about the truffle chips and the steak.  I mean, they were good...just nothing exciting.  Except for maybe, one tidbit about how they cook their chips/fries 3 times: boiled, baked and fried.  \n\nCORNISH HEN:\nIt came with veggies and I'm glad I ordered a side of English chips or I would've ended up hungry.

I'm not a fan. 2/5\n\nSTICKY TOFFEE PUDDING:\nA classic.  It's warm, ooey-gooey and served with a scoop of ice cream and it was just perfect! 5/5\n\nBUTTERSCOTCH POT DE CREME:\nIt's got pumpkin and a hint of nutmeg with pumpkin seeds on top. Reminds me of fall/Thanksgiving. 4/5\n\nTRIPLE CHOCOLATE TRIFLE:\nI'm a chocoholic so I had to have this. Not the best chocolate dessert I've had but it's good. I finished my dessert without a problem. 4/5\n\nThe food was good but the service needs to be improved.  Our food came one at a time and we normally wait until the last person gets her/his food before we all start eating.  A few follow-ups later, the last person got her food and by the time, everyone's food already had gotten cold.  The manager came and talked to us so, our desserts were comped.  It took forever to get drink refills and if you ask for sweetener or anything at all...you might have to wait 30 minutes to get it.  So, overall, I'd give this place 3.5/5 stars.  If I were Gordon Ramsay, I would tell the staff to \"f@*% off!\""

Got seated ASAP after checking in with waters but it took our waitress forever to get my lemons which she did not bring and it even took a lot longer for our food to come out. Not sure if it was her fault or if the kitchen was backed up but at 1pm the place wasn't busy at all. \n\nI ordered this salmon puree appetizer and it came in a small jar with 6 thick slices of toasted white soft bread. Really good for less than $20 and it was very filling because I only ate about 3 slices of bread. The bread was really good, soft and crispy even when it cooled down it was still really good to eat with the salmon puree or by itself. I really enjoyed it because it reminded me a lot like a lox and bagel without the capers. \n\nMy two girlfriends got the lamb burger which they devoured and loved. I didn't get to try it because I don't eat meat but I did get to try the fries that it came with. I love fries so I already knew I would like it but I didn't know I would love it! It wasn't overly salty or oily and it was a thicker slice with the right amount of salt. It was so good just plain and it didn't need the ketchup dip. \n\nPrices are reasonable and it's located in Cesar's hotel right across the casino by the Forum shops. Reasonable prizes and big portions! Just be sure to wait awhile."

We'd previously tried Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood, and it was very good.  So this visit was our shot to see what the big deal is.  \n\nWe actually sat at the bar before it opened.  We were sitting right there, watching, and the bartender did not use the ingredients listed in the menu.  Now, this was a recon visit, so we didn't say anything--I just took notes for this review.  Our other drink was as stated in the menu.  Okay.  Both drinks were very tasty, even very good.  (We're into mixology, so take that for what it is--the drinks were good.)\n\nWe had fish and chips and the beef burger.  We both thought the food was excellent.  Damn it to hell, I cannot trash him on this meal.  I would have liked more peas with the fish, but no ding for that. \n\nIncidentally, I don't think it's widely known that many of these big shots' restaurants are actually joint ventures with the hotels.  Very likely there is some lack of control and issues with quality control in such arrangements.  Nevertheless, if a guy who expects 110% out of everyone in his sphere of greatness puts his name on something, he gets held to that same standard. \n\nSo, 4 out of 5 stars.  It was very good, but not 110%.  Next Vegas visit is GR Steak.  Stay tuned.  I'll be taking notes."

(Was it you or Caesers that set the prices?)\n\nBest I've had in Vegas, definitely outside of England, but are you freaking kidding me??  $30!! For a spoonful of mushy peas, a few steak cut fries, and (2) 2x2 inch fish fillets??  Yard House fish & chips are almost half the price, same portion size & just as good. \n\nLightly battered. Crunchy on both sides. Fish flakey & cooked through. Fries were great. Mushy peas...I prefer them without the mint. Fantastic!!  Definitely not worth $30!!\n\nLobster mac? Just good. Cheesy. Not great. Not fab. Not worth $25, even if you split it with a friend.  It's a side item, not an entree. No chunks of lobster in this, but its there. Just not easily noticeable. \n\n$5 for ice tea. And we had to beg for a refill. \n\nAs for our server: don't know her name. My receipt says Lisa W. Wanted to take our drink order before the hostess walked away from seating us. She was nice when she was at our table. Lots of attention prior to ordering, none after. She was kinda a know it all about English food, trying to one-up us when we asked a question about the food in comparison to what we've eaten in England.  Refilled our tea WITHOUT ice. So much for ice tea. \n\nOur bill was $90 for 2 people: 2 ice teas, mac & cheese, fish & chips, & some corned beef sandwich. We left with NO desire to come back. NO longing to come back to try something else. Chef, your prices suck!!  Your own burger here is TWICE that of what you serve at BurGR and truffle chips are better & $3 less at BurGR too! And you get more!!  I expect to pay these prices at an upscale restaurant, like Steak, but NOT a pub. Not even in the UK!!\n\nCome during happy hour. Sadly I will never be able to. I work full-time!!  This place DEFINITELY caters to tourists & not the locals."

My wife and I ordered the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish and Chips, Chicken Lollipops, and the English Ale Onion Soup. The names were very creative, but unfortunately, the food was not all that great. The fish for the fish and chips were NOT hot and flaky like you'd expect on a fresh battered fish. It came off like frozen fish. The fries were not quite as crunchy as you'd expect. It was slightly soggy and the standards just were not there. Definitely not what you would expect when paying for a $28 fish and chip basket. The onion soup was just another french onion soup in the guise of great marketing. As for the chicken lollipops, they tasted like frozen wings that were not fried crispy and the wing sauce was super salty. I had to drown the wings' saltiness with a good helping of the bleu cheese sauce and the peeled veggies next to it. \n\nThe decor was a mixed bag. There was nothing all that special about the decor. They had stacked beer kegs and chairs with his dogs on them. I would've expected a little more wood to make it look a little more authentic pub and modernize the furnishings.\n\nAt the end of our dinner service, our tab came out to about $110, and we gave the server a $100 VISA gift card and a $20 bill and explained to him to only charge a $100 and take the rest, The guy clearly understood what I told him, and came back saying he tried charging $100 and then $90 but it declined. LIES! I checked my balance on the card when I got back to my hotel room later, and he had charged $120 the first time, and then $115 just to make me use another form of payment. I gave him my regular credit card, but that was just poor service, and didn't appreciate the lying from the server.\n\nAll in all, dinner service from the food to the service was subpar. I was really disappointed going into what I thought would be an enjoyable experience. Even if the experience was not the best, I wouldn't give a star on here, but the subpar food, and the server being dishonest just killed it for me at the end of it all. Look through the rest of the reviews for this place. The reviews speak for themselves as to the disappointment from many diners. I can't in good conscience recommend this place, and I can't believe that Gordon Ramsay would appreciate what's going on at this restaurant with his branding on it."

First off it should have been called the sausage variety platter in mush! 3 different variety of sausage, one of which was a banger and it tasted fine. For a reason that escapes me they dumped steamed spinach over the mashed potatoes making them a soupy mess. Onion gravy was the only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1. 1 of the sausages was some sort of smoked thing that tasted some where between a nathan hot dog and a sausage you would get at a texas bbq, weird...\n\nI knew this was not going to be fine dinning by any stretch.

Gordon Ramsay plus some beer sounds pretty awesome after a long day of work, so we still decided to give it a try despite the not so good review on yelp. \n\nThe wait wasn't too bad, we got seated in about 45 minutes or so. They do have a good variety of beer selection and other alcoholic beverages. I wasn't too disappointed at the drinks but was definitely disappointed at the food. \n\n30 minutes after the waiter took our order, we asked about our food because the table next to us with party of 2, who got in about same time as us, already finished their food and left. He told us that our food is next on kitchen list (not exactly sure what this means). Then he came back again, he told one of my friend to choose something else from the menu because they ran out the dish he ordered. \n\nFinally when the food came, the order got a little messed up and the food only tasted ok. The fries had different consistency where some are too crunchy and some are not crunchy enough. When we get the bill, the 18% gratuity is already included. Not a good overall experience and it was too expensive for what you get."

My wife ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and the chicken was super dry... If it was Hell's Kitchen I think GR would have thrown the whole plate at a garbage bin across the room.   I ordered the fish and chips... And was awarded with two very small pieces of fish and very soggy fries.   The tartar sauce was really good though.

There was a 15-20 min wait to get in, no big deal, & compared to the 2 hr Bacchanal wait this seemed super minor. Our server (Ricardo I think?) did a great job, was personable, offered great advice, & was knowledgeable of the menu. Zero complaints there. Ambiance was fine, comfy chairs, TVs conveniently placed for sports, with kind of a modern British pub feel/layout.\n\nWe started off with the Devilishly Deviled Eggs, which are served with the deviled yolks in a separate bowl, and are amazing.  Super great flavor on the deviled yolks (is that bacon I taste??), great consistency, and an easy way to get some yolk with every bite. Next up were the Welsh Rarebit ham sandwich, and the Short Rib & Cheek sandwich.  Both had excellent flavor, were served hot, and were of more than adequate size.  My gf preferred her short rib/cheek sandwich, while I preferred the taste of the ham/rarebit cheese sauce, but we agreed both were very good.  We subbed out our fries for the mashed potatoes, and neither of us were disappointed.  I also got an imperial pint of Boddingtons, took maybe 7-10 minutes to be delivered (only real service delay), but was frosty cold when it arrived.  \n\nWe had no issues with waiting for food, service in general, or anything else that several reviewers have mentioned.  I guess this place might struggle for service consistency based on crowd load, and dinner sounds like it is the worst time for issues, but for lunch time, British pub-style comfort food (read: super when hungover), this place completely hit the spot!"

It is a restaurant that brings the British Pub experience to you with the atmosphere as well as the authentic British pub foods that it offers.\n\nUpon walking up to the front entrance of the restaurant, I noticed a bunch of barrels stacked on top of each other.  The decor of the place was pretty cool.  The lighting was very dim and obviously this is a casual restaurant since it is supposed to mimic a British pub.  The pub has 36 different beers on tap as well as another 63 different bottled beers.  I don't drink so this was not a selling point for me.  I was more there for the Gordon Ramsay food and because the winner of Hell's Kitchen for one of the seasons was supposed to be the main chef at this particular restaurant. \n\nThe bf and I did not have to make reservations to Pub & Grill and we were glad to find out that there was no wait time.  This was possibly the foreshadowing of what was to come after we were seated.\n\nPub & Grill does serve a 3-course meal, but since the bf and I had just done the Hell's Kitchen courses at Gordon Ramsay's Steak inside Paris the night before, we decided not to do the courses at Pub & Grill.  We both ordered our own dishes and shared.\n\nWe ordered the GRP Lolli-Pop Chicken Wings which came with a stilton blue cheese dip.  You can either order a dozen wings which is $22 or 1/2 dozen wings which is $12.  As you can see from the picture, I felt like we got ripped off.  All we got were luke warm puny looking chicken wings that were overpriced in my opinion.  For $12, you'd expect to at least not be served wings from anorexic chickens.  Is it too much to expect hot food instead of warm?  Ramsay would be fuckin' pissed if he was there.\n\nNext, we ordered the 9 oz Grilled Lamb Burger which consists of caramelized onions with a goats cheese-feta spread & rosemary brioche bun and is served with fries & a house pickle.  The price of this burger was $21.  The waitress couldn't stop raving about how good this burger was and that she highly recommended it.  The Grilled Lamb Burger came out and honestly, there was nothing special about it.  It tasted like any regular lamb burger.  For being pricey, you'd expect it to taste amazing or at least have a wow factor to it.  Nope!  It was a huge disappointment.  We should have demanded our money back and spent it on the burgers at BurGR.  At least they were a little bit cheaper and taste amazing!\n\nThe last dish we ordered was the Pan-Seared Diver Scallops which came with steamed clams, leeks, potato-bacon chowder & confit tomatoes.  This dish was $32.  This was another dish that came out luke warm.  For being super expensive, the clams were tiny and the chowder didn't really have much flavor.  It almost tasted as though someone had forgotten to season it.  This was a huge disappointment.  It was definitely not worth the money.  While eating this dish, I bit into a small piece of the clam shell that was mixed into the chowder.  \n\nPub & Grill is Ramsay's worse restaurant in Vegas.  He needs to pay a visit there and make sure that everything is up to his standards.  Being served warm food is not acceptable unless that is how British pub food is served.  If that's the case, I do apologize in advance for talking shit.  Overall, the customer service was alright.  The food is way overpriced and it is not worth it so I don't recommend anyone going here."

You have so many elements just giving it a overall astetic pub masterpiece. \n\nAs far as food goes, I would try the butter chicken curry. My favorite is the Lamb burger, the coleslaw gives a good crunchy texture when you bite into it. The feta sauce goes well with the lamb. A lamb burger must, it also pairs perfectly with their Dog fish 60 minute. You can really get a hightened taste of the lamb with every sip."

The prime rib was perfectly marbled, had the right amount of seasoning and tasted exactly how it should. I will say, generally speaking, either restaurants don't know what the hell \"medium rare\" means or they're afraid of getting sued if someone eats meat too underdone and gets sick. Medium-rare seems to be always served as Medium.\n\nThe Yorkshire pudding that came with it was also excellent. Fluffy and flavourful. I don't see this served with prime rib in other restaurants as much as I'd like to.\n\nThe service was adequate but not spectacular by any stretch. Drinks came in a reasonable amount of time, as with the food. Refills were a touch slow.\n\nThe price was a little bit steep but not in outer space by any means. Enjoying the food makes it easy to forget how much it cost.\n\nI'd say that you should check this place out on the strength of their prime rib alone."

The waitress became somewhat more apologetic at that point, but the speed of the service was terrible.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered fish and chips.

I could not resist skipping out on a celebrity chef meal right? I actually came here 2 years ago for a Yelp event and they have certainly made changes for the better. \n\nBefore we ordered our waitress Carrie gave us a little run down on the background of the resto in addition to some of her recommendations from appetizers to entrees. I thought that was very nice of her to do that considering some people are clueless as to what they want to order. We started our meal with calamari which was suggested to us by Carrie. It came out pretty fast and I did enjoy it because the breading was quit different than what I'm used to. Typically calamari is more of a flour based breading and I could tell they used bread crumbs possibly? I liked it because it added a bit more texture to it and to add to that the squid was not rubbery which I have experienced at other places. The tartar sauce was had a home made touch to it, it was probably house made? For the entree, I had the pub salad. The protein in the salad was chicken, ham and shrimp. It may sound overwhelming, but it actually wasn't. The amount they put of each was just right, which made the salad still a light option. There was also little bits of apples, chickpeas, and cherry tomatoes which added to the freshness to the dish as a whole. Finally the red wine vinaigrette brought everything together and they did so by putting the perfect amount for the salad. I was definitely pleased because I did not want anything heavy because I knew I was going to have a heavy dinner. As we were eating we saw that a man in a suit walking around the resto asking customers how their food was, I overheard him say his name was Derrick. I assume he was the manager and it just goes to show how much they care about pleasing their dinners. While eating we needed re-fills on our drinks and caught the attention of a server by the name of Sara. Normally I don't like asking other servers for anything because they are assigned a certain area of tables. However, Sara  did so willingly and was very nice about it. She even said if there was anything else we needed to let her know. To top off our meal Chef Scott from Hell's Kitchen came our and introduced himself to Melissa Y. and I, totally unexpected. We were kind of star-struck too at the same time! Lol.. Anyway, this place has definitely improved this time around and I can't wait to be back."

            "review": "I live in Las Vegas so I'm used to having some great places to eat. And in my view  one of the best places on the Strip is Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris casino. We go there from time to time and we're consistently impressed. It's excellent from the moment you sit down to the minute you leave. We're not all too concerned with price, particularly for a great experience, but it's hard not to notice how expensive Steak is. Still, it's just that good. \n\nThis weekend we gave Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill a try at Caesars casino. It's decidedly different. Far more casual than Steak and focused on pub style food. Overall, we had a very good experience but as I recollect it now, I'm not sure it's enough to get us to go back. It's the kind of place that I'd gladly step into if I were strolling through Caesars, perhaps there to shop at the attached mall, but I don't think I'd make a special trip in just to eat there again. It's not that it's bad, not at all. But it's surrounded by a city full of great dining experiences.\n\nTo start (and despite some terrible reviews here to the contrary), our server was lovely, vivacious and helpful. She was friendly and attentive. The bar menu, complete with some innovative custom cocktails, tons of beer options, and a serviceable wine list, was presented on an iPad that provides plenty of details and an easy way to sort through to find what you want. We started with two of their own cocktails (I tried \"Mother's Ruin,\" a nice mix of gin, sage liqueur, cucumber and lime), and some oysters, which were tastefully presented on cutting boards with traditional accompaniments. The bread service was a nice array of crusty, warm, house-baked pretzels (three different kinds) and a nice cheese dipping sauce, all very good. \n\nThe only hiccup in service was when our mains arrived so quickly that our appetizers hadn't yet been cleared. The servers who delivered them (not our waitress but two other men) seemed flummoxed. Their hands full they sort of just looked at us to move the dishes aside for them. But the table being small, there really was no place to put the spent plates and utensils. A line manager came to help, but he too seemed sort of clueless and overwhelmed. Neither of us thought too much of it and helped as best we could, but it was a strange moment that you'd expect the team was better trained to handle.\n\nOur food was good. I had the beef cheeks, which has the consistency of a pot roast. It was served over some mashed potatoes and roasted onion. The portion was very generous and the dish was tasty, though just a little underseasoned. My wife had the mustard-basted flat iron steak served with an onion puree and Stilton cheese. Good, but underwhelming, she said.\n\nWe split sides of smashed fingerling potatoes (which were seasoned with double cream, butter, and black truffle) and creamed spinach with Stilton cheese. Both were very good. The sticky toffee pudding for dessert was excellent.\n\nAt the bar that night was Jan'el Witt, the recent winner of Ramsay's television show \"Hell's Kitchen.\" Our waitress told us that she'd begin her reward as the \"head chef\" of the Pub & Grill in August. \n\nSo, in all, that leaves us at about a 3-star rating. A nice evening, a good meal, a fun time. But with so many options in Vegas, I'm not sure we'll be back again to the Pub & Grill. Unlike Gordon Ramsay Steak, which just screams a kind of uniqueness, Pub & Grill is good, but perhaps not special enough to warrant a return trip."

Maybe. \n\nI just got done attending a function at Caesars and was craving a burger, I'm talking pregnancy cravings here, enter Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill. I sat in the bar area was immediately greeted by a server who fired off the specials and took my drink order. I went looking for the burgers on the pub menu and very surprised when I saw that there are only four burgers offered. I'm assuming he keeps the rest of these juicy treats at his other place. \n\nOn recommendation from the server I went the Hell's Kitchen Burger. This spicy slab of beef comes topped with Ghost Pepper cheese, pickled jalape\u00f1os, avocado and a smoked tomato aioli. I love spice, flavor spice, not the \"light your hair on fire\", but the responsible and reserved use of heat when cooking. This burger was all that and more, the beef was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink and very juicy, so very food porny. The ghost pepper cheese had a slow burn and after a while it began to take hold, but not enough for me to stop. The smoked tomato aioli, pickled jalapenos and avocado were a flavor bomb of happiness that helped cool down my mouth with each bite. Seriously, call me a burger whore because I was all over this thing. \n\nThe fries were good, but basic and I didn't really finish them, but the burger portion size was plenty big and filled me up fairly quick. The main thing that did bother me was my seat, I felt I was sinking the whole time and had to keep adjusting my seat and/or style of sitting. This was a minor thing, but after a while it became annoying. I would have probably ordered another drink and allowed my food to settle, but I just couldn't get comfortable.  \n\n$22 for a burger? I'm not surprised you ballsy MOFO, but I'm even more surprised you could back it up."

The water wasn't refilled until we asked and this poor busboy came running to give us water. Food came out in good timing though. \nThe food was good, but for the price I paid I expected more. We got the Bangers and Mash as well as Steak and Ale Pie. We also got the sauteed mushrooms and wings. The wings were great, but pricey. The portions were smaller than I expected, but I was full since it was full of mashed potatoes and bread. It was delicious, but it's the type of food that's not too hard to make so we weren't too impressed. \nThe location is great as it is near the parking structure so you don't have to walk too far. The restaurant itself is pretty comfy, not romantic, so it's best for a group of friends or coworkers. Lots of TVs so it is also great to watch a game. \nA plus was that we got to see the Hell's Kitchen winner so that was pretty cool. Overall, it was A-ok."

I thought this was a great idea so I could sample all the taste Gordon has to offer but it backfired a bit because it really is just an appetizer, so I was still a bit hungry afterwards.  Each meat pie was about as good as a meat pie can get, but that's not saying much.  Looking back I should have ordered either a whole pie or the burger, or maybe the sampler and a burger.

We started with the warm pretzels ($8) with a white cheddar sauce and seedy English mustard.  The cup with three pretzel sticks were perfect - a nice crispy skin and tender interior.  The creamy and slightly sharp cheese sauce and the gourmet mustard were plentiful and great for dipping (separately and together).  This was a great prelude.\n\nFor our entrees, we split the wedge salad and the mixed vegetable salad ($15 and $16 each).  The wedge salad was quite good - baby iceberg was sweet and crisp and topped with grated hardboiled egg, bits of blue cheese and bacon and crispy onions and sat in a bed of creamy blue cheese dressing with a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette on the top.  It was a hearty salad that was at once rich, sweet, salty and tangy.  I would definitely get this again.  The mixed vegetable salad was a m\u00e9lange of spring greens with shaved fennel, carrots and radishes and bits of cucumber and halved cherry tomatoes that were overdressed with a white balsamic vinaigrette and finished with some crunchy caramelized cashews.  Other than the excess dressing, this was a very good salad.  \n\nOverall, it was a 3.5 star experience.  I know from experience that the potted chocolate trifle is worth the trip, and the wedge was great as well as the pretzels.  The other salad and the service were not as wonderful, but such is the Vegas food scene."

We were one of the first ones there and there were several other tables that got their food first.  All in all it was 90 mins start to finish for lunch."

I watched his show so I was in fact curious to try. when I arrived the one hostess told another to take me there but she was doing her own thing with her bag facing her back toward me and then another guy came so the first hostess asked him to take me to table. He was not really greeting me and I kinda just follow him. Then he seemed lost and didn't know which number is located where. He showed me to a wrong table and asked if I know how they looked. Fortunately for him, I knew I was supposed to meet all Koreans so I could locate my own table. When they brought appetizers, they didn't bring extra spoons or forks so I had to use my personal fork to get food from the plate which was supposed to be shared with others. And then the main dish was not really more than average. Most dishes were too salty. He shouldn't expand fast and big if he can't find right management to control the quality. What a shame. I will never go back. Over priced. Dreadful food. Bad and unprofessional service. Food is too salty or too sweet."

Still, 2 minutes later via use of the opentable app, I had a reservation in hand for 6PM and killed an hour at the tables prior to getting seated in a half-empty house.\n\nFiguring we were at a british pub, I did the fish and chips w. mushy peas, and skipped a starter as we had an awesome lunch earlier and weren't super hungry.\n\nDespite the pleasant service from the Gary Busey lookalike waiter, the food arrived scalding hot, as we downed our first pints. \n\nThe chips were undercooked and scaling hot (as my buddy got a side of chips that were a bit crisper with his dish).\n\nThe fish was super-oily, and despite the newspaper themed dresses worn by the hostesses, it wasn't served over any sort of newspaper/newspaper style wax paper.\n\nThe mushy peas were pretty good.\n\nAs we were leaving after finishing dinner, the restaurant was still 1/3 empty. \n\nNo idea what was up with their reservation system, as we were told we'd need to wait 3.5 hours for a table at 5PM, got a table via opentable at 6PM and were seated in a half-empty house, and when leaving at 6:45PM, left a restaurant that was 1/3 empty.\n\nAlso, given the pricing (significantly higher than Aria's Todd English P.U.B.), and non-quality of the food, I'm not looking to return on my next venture to Vegas."

Thank god because my friend got the short ribs which were bland and lacked any type of appeal. My other friend got the fish and chips which was a big portion and tasted way better in comparison to our dishes. I got the Caesar salad. Let me start by saying I LOVE dressing and am often told I use too much, but there was so much it was so unbearable I had to ask for extra croutons just to finish half of it. The salad was drenched in dressing and wasn't even edible. \n\nWe've been to other Gordon Ramsay places and I had my apprehensions reading all the reviews, but with all the other great places to eat on the strip...DO NOT eat here.

Each one was absolutely great but the Shepherd pie definitely blew the others out of the way. So flaky, and warm, it was just perfect. So if you do try the place just trust me and order the Shepherd pie and you'll be like a happy little kid. \n\nAs for the spotted dick, AKA bread pudding, it's absolutely and utterly amazing.

I did finish that because it was too damn good, but I did stuff myself.

We are local to Las Vegas, so it was fun to visit the strip for dinner.  We had 6:30 reservations but arrived at around 6 and was taken to our table without a wait.  The table and chairs were very comfortable and the big screens located throughout the restaurant provided for a fun, pub-style atmosphere.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and made our experience enjoyable. \n\nI had the fish and chips, my wife had the shephard's pie, my son the lamb burger and my daughter the butter curry.  All dishes were very tasty and met our expectations.  I paired by fish and chips with an Innus & Gunn beer which hit the spot.  We all shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert - also tasty.\n\nThe only thing that was a disappointment was the fact that they discontinued the Total Rewards discount and they have nothing in place for locals (as many other restaurants in tourist areas do).  Nonetheless, I was expecting to pay Gordon Ramsey prices, so it was not a shock.  The food was good, service great and overall experience was fantastic.  Definitely a once-in-a-while only type of experience for us given the cost, but worthwhile!"

            "review": "Please save yourselves! I so wanted to like this restaurant. We were there for dinner on a Monday night. Arriving at about 9:15, we only had a 20 minute wait. The decor was really neat, from the lighting to the eating utensils. Even the servers and hostesses uniforms were nicely done. We should've known after waiting 15 minutes before anyone greeted our table that our night was doomed. Of course we were getting anxious and ready to leave but we wanted to try this restaurant so badly and we didn't want to look around for another restaurant and have to possibly wait again. So finally our server arrived. I had seen this server the whole time taking care of the table next to us, so clearly he had seen us as well as another one of his tables that was seated one minute after us. Unfortunately we were not given drink menus when we were seated. The server had it with him on an ipad when he greeted us. This could've taken another five minutes to put our drink order in because he tried to leave it with us and walk away. Fortunately my husband and I immediately spotted a couple of beers on the first paged and ordered before he walked away. When our server returned with our beers five minutes later, he dropped them off and said he'd be right back after he dropped off a menu at another table. Another few minutes later he dropped off some bread and again said he'd be right back to take our order after he dropped off another table's bill. Either this guy had far too many tables to wait on or he was the world's biggest idiot. He was very nice, and tried very hard to crack jokes and make us forget about the past 25 minutes of horrible service. I actually felt really bad for the guy. My husband ordered the lamb burger which was only available on the bar menu but our server made it sound as if he would do us the huge favor and get it for him anyway. Turns out we saw lot's of burgers being delivered to tables. So I wonder why they don't just put the $20 burger on the full dining menu. Anyway, my husband didn't care much for the burger but we both agreed that the fries were outstanding. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and honest to God have never had a worse salad. I think there must have been some sort of mix up or error in the kitchen with my salad because it was so bad. The dressing must've been mayonnaise or something worse. My biggest regret is that I didn't say anything about it to the server. Normally I have no problem with speaking up about bad food but I was mentally exhausted and so completely over this dinner that it was too much effort to say anything. My next regret is that I actually ate it. What is my problem? I ate this disgusting salad and what does that say about me? Gross! I guess I was hungry. Our server obviously felt bad about the service because after we finished eating, he dropped off our check and told us he was deducting $10 from it. We smiled and thanked him. Nope, no deduction, just our full price bill. Again, too irritated and over the whole experience that we just paid and left. On a more positive note, they had a great selection of beer. Overpriced of course, but so is everything in Vegas so we can't fault them for that."

Many rave that they have the best fish and chips in town or the best curry on their menu and all of them fail miserably at delivering to the high standards they hype the restaurants up to by serving frozen chips. That is, all of them but Gordon Ramsay's Pub. \n\nWe started off our late lunch with the Lobster and Shrimp Rolls. Holy cow! These were the dog's bollocks! (For you Americans, that means they were BOMB!) Light and refreshing Maine lobster and shrimp served on a toasted roll. My friend and I both agreed we would be happy with just that every time we came. Then came the Sliders which were perfectly cooked and a decent size. \n\nHere's where we got a little greedy... Well, I got a little greedy. Back home I would always opt for either the fish and chips or the chicken curry and chips. Today, I opted for both... And shared reluctantly with my friend. Bloody hell, GR Pub know how to portion your food to feed you for a week. Let's start with the curry... The Butter Chicken Curry was served with basmati rice and a naan bread. The chicken was so tender it fell apart and melted in your mouth. Chef Otto Spohn came out to check on us and was saying they marinate the breast for a day in the curry base. This set the curry apart from other attempts to serve Indian in a pub in Las Vegas by miles. Normally I would do half and half (chips and rice) with my curry in England so I was looking forward to soaking my chips in the curry sauce. \n\nNow onto the fish and chips. This is where I am most critical. There's nothing like proper fish and chips from the chip shop or pub back home. I never order them in America because I'm always disappointed. Freshly cooked, they came out steaming hot with tartare sauce and mushy peas (a British staple side for fish and chips). The chips were not cut like a typical chip shop chip. They were miles better than the frozen chips or French fries every other venue serves up in America, but they just weren't what I was hoping for. They were bloody good, mind. Just not what I expected from a British guy's pub. The fish on the other hand was PERFECTION! Light, crispy, and huge pieces. I ended up with enough for lunch the next day as well. LOVED the recipe. \n\nWe were celebrating my birthday and we were sent out two of the four desserts. The chocolate trifle which I had forgotten how much I loved back home. It was refreshing and delicious. The masterpiece however, was the good old fashioned Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh. My. God. I was in heaven!!!! This was THE best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had... Trust me, I've had a lot of them. \n\nThe whole experience from start to end was bloody marvellous. Our waitress, Yanesy was bubbly, funny, and very attentive. I will be requesting her every time I'm back. The decor has a very posh British flair with fancy upholstery and excellent uses of the Union Jack, British landmarks, and of course the signature newspaper print typically associated with fish and chips. I can't wait to go back."

And then we sat for another eleven minutes and fifty two seconds before the waiter came over to ask if we wanted dessert. Nope, just the check now.

The service was quick and friendly and the truffle chips were good but not quite hot enough when served.  This is my 5th or 6th time here and it's pretty consistent.  I've had their sliders and corned beef sandwich as well and all were good.  Of course it's a little $$, but it's in Vegas so you expect to pay $21 for a burger."

We waited 30 minutes past our predicted seating time- I can understand this, as jostesses have no control over when people get up. But after waiting  a half hour over our wait time, we got no apology from management. Our waiter ignored us for the most part; the most active he was was when he failed to ask our beer sizes and automatically charged us for big beers. Our drinks, apps and food came out at one time- again with no apology from server or manager. I work in the service industry and can be extremely forgiving, but overall the food and service were far below par."

I had the prime rib but they forgot to put the beef drippings on the Yorkshire pudding which left me with a partial meal. Mr Ramsay would have had something to say about it for sure. Natalie was a very good waitress and she went above and beyond to make sure I left the restaurant happy. Everyone else in our party was pleased with their meals.

At no point should the waiter tell me that $17 calamari is justified no matter the quality because we are in Caesars Palace. To be fair, the calamari was decent. \n\nI am only giving 2 stars because of the terrible service. The food was good, not great. I can get better at my local pub for a lot less money."

The happy hour runs daily from 2-5 PM, nice because it is on the earlier side of some of the other happy hours in Vegas, allowing for optimal bar crawling if that is your preference.  In my case, I happened to stop in on my last day in town before getting on the road back to Los Angeles.  The bartenders were great, extremely friendly and very prompt when service was needed.\n\nFor food we ordered the Truffle Fries ($5) and Nachos ($7).  On the fence about the wings, we were proposed to give the wings a shot and if we didn't like them, we would not be charged for them.  Swayed, we gave them a shot.  Despite the name, they were not breathtakingly spicy.  They did have a tinge of Asian-style sweetness, but all-in-all were pretty good.  The nachos came with a good chunk of meet on top of potato chips.  A little different, more British style, but all around pretty good.  The truffle fries I was quite excited for given that I saw pictures of thick planks of fries on Yelp.  Unfortunately, they were the thin variation, not much different from fries you could get anywhere.  The aioli was good, but I was unimpressed by the fries, especially for $5.  However, my girlfriend enjoyed them.  Drinks were also on special, including champagne, to my girlfriend's pleasure."

Then we are taken to a seat in the bar area next to all the kegs that were used as the divider for the bar area and the seating area. We were not asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, my girl always will prefer a booth but we were not given that option. \nWe were seated and left alone for about 5min before I had to flag down a busser to ask for a menu. Looking at the menu for about 5-10 more minutes we were never approached by another employee at all. We were not offered water or drinks or asked if we were ready to order. Now considering the fact that by the time we each have a meal and a drink we were looking to spend close to $100 for burgers we elected to just get up and walk out. As far as the food goes I have actually eaten wings and a burger from here while playing poker in Caesars poker room and it is pretty good food from what I have seen. Having said that I cannot say the same for their service in my particular case. I'm sorry with me you only get one shot at my business I really see no reason to go back after my initial experience. I would rather go to Bachi Burger by my house and only spend $40-$50 for an even better quality meal that you will get here. \n\nSorry Gordon I just call them the way I see them , from watching all your shows I was honestly shocked by the service we encountered.

Way overdone on the onions and the bread was burnt on the edges.\n\nShepherd's Pie had greasy gravy instead of a well-developed flavorful, thick gravy.  \n\nThe service was fast on delivering the food and drinks but slow on clearing plates, not getting the right entree in front of the right person (that has to be an expected from GR!?) and checking back in, not bringing malt vinegar automatically for fish & chips nor a lime for a vodka and tonic.\n\nHits:  Atmosphere was fun, if a little loud.\n\nMini Burger Sliders were small but tasty.\n\nMashed potatoes on top of the shepherd's pie - so smooth and well executed.\n\nFish for the fish and chips.

As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Friday afternoon we chose to start our GR Tour of Vegas at the Pub and Grill. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted and seated. Within a few min we were introduced to our server Joe. For anyone reading this, please ask to sit in Joe's section. His friendliness, and knowledge of the menu was refreshing. He was able to make some suggestions that sounded amazing, however after seeing the nachos Gordon Ramsay posted on his Instagram we couldn't help but give them a try, and boy are we glad we did! They are out of this world! In addition to the nachos we enjoyed a chicken pesto sandwich. While the flavor was amazing I almost cracked a tooth about half way through on a chicken bone. I discreetly brought this to Joe's attention so he could give the chef a heads up for future sandwiches. What was impressive, is where most servers acknowledge and nothing ever comes of it, he immediately spoke to his manager Derek who came over to apologize and even went as far as offering us a dessert. To think I almost left needing dental work, but still feel compelled to give a 5 star rating should tell you how great Joe and Derek were! They both truly understand the meaning of customer service and I hope someone at the Gordon Ramsay Group reads this to provide them with the recognition they deserve! \n\nPS - The sticky toffee is to die for and personally I think it has Steak beat!"

After 30 I asked and was told 10 minutes. At this point everyone behind us had already been seated. We ended up leaving so we could get to our show. At 7 pm an hour after giving our name I received a text that our table was ready. Wish we could have tried the food. This is why living in Vegas we stay away from the Strip.

At some moments, I thought there must be secret cameras filming my exasperating experience for the sake of entertainment and reality TV. But alas, it was just an unintentionally underwhelming dining experience.\n\nI ordered the beef burger, and it was delicious. Juicy, huge, well seasoned and cooked as I requested, medium. Served with ketchup and garlic aioli on a soft bun, it was decadent, rich and meaty, everything one would need after a night out in Vegas. However delicious, I found it to be extremely plain. No options for toppings or anything could have offered some freshness. Just a meat patty, bun and bacon. I can't say it was worth the over $20 price tag for a burger alone. The accompanying fries were nothing special. The fish and chips were good, but extremely oily. I loved that they were huge, thick chunks of fish, and the batter was crispy and flavorful. But just a little too greasy for my taste.\n\nService is undeniably what put a damper on our experience. Our food took an eternity to come out. The two tables next to us were seated, ate their meals, and even paid their bill all in the time it took for our party of six to receive our food. When we asked for the check, it took an eternity for our credit cards to be processed. Most of our meal was spent anxiously waiting, either for the food, drink refills, and finally, the bill. There was no sense of urgency, and the restaurant was less than half full.  For a restaurant of Gordon Ramsay repute, the service was baffling. I wish he were there to scream at the chef and waitstaff to hurry the f**k up.\n\nLocated in Cesar's Palace, this restaurant doesn't seem to get too crowded so it's a good choice for a decent meal if you want to eat somewhere other than the food court or the lines for more popular establishments are too long."

Really? Maybe because I'm from Michigan and we have usually have at least 10-20 craft beers on tap. The beer selection was rather boring at the Pub and Grill and topped out at maybe 12 beers. \n\nI got the Braised Short Rib and while it was fall off the bone tender, there was nothing spectacular about it. It was simply atop some plain old mashed potatoes with a few undercooked carrots and parnsips on the periphery. Certainly not worth near the $40. I don't think I would ever eat here again. Not that it was a horrible experience but because there was nothing special about anything."

I've looked forward for so long to try this place out and the best way I can explain it is to think about the Price is Right song when people lose on the show......yeah exactly.\n\nWe were in Vegas for opening weekend of the tournament and originally had reservations for Gordon's steak house but after conversing with our bartender a couple days prior he mentioned that pub would be better suited for a larger group. We arrived for our reservation after seeing Seinfeld and were seated promptly, after that its ALL DOWNHILL. It took over 20 minutes just to get water! When the server finally came over he looked confused and to be honest a little pretentious.  I would have expected this from his steakhouse but not the pub. Anyway we put in our appetizer order, calamari and shrimp cocktail, which came out in piece meal again not seeing our waiter this entire time. I will say the shrimp cocktail was the best part of the meal (that's why they received a star) but the calamari left something to be desired. Two people in our party ordered the prime rib and after specifically asking the server how it was given the time (it was 10pm) he noted that it was perfectly cooked and good to go, however what they received was a tough gray log. I ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it came out medium....at best, it was definitely more gray then pink. My one friend might have had it right just ordering a chicken sandwich!\n\nAll in all, I was very disappointed by this place and can say that I will not be going back. The things that Gordon prides himself on, service and perfectly cooked food, were surely lacking."

Or maybe people are just pickier on the Strip ;)\n\nWe went with one of the fixed menu options.\n\nSoup - Cream of Cauliflower. This was excellent. And I say that as some one who normally abhors cauliflower.  The curry oil was a wonderful, warm touch.\n\nFish and Chips - The batter was delicious and the portion of fish was generous. More then enough food on the plate, I was pleasantly surprised. The chips were some of the best I have ever had. Fresh potatoes and the shaved cheese was super flavorful\n\nShepherd's Pie - My husband ordered this but of course I had to sneak a bite. Smooth, creamy potatoes. The meat was tender and the vegetables still had a nice flavor to them that was not covered up by the broth from the meat. I am not normally a fan of lamb but this was pretty dang good!\n\nDessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding. This was my first time trying sticky toffee pudding but I am now a converted fan. I wanted to take a bath in the sauce that was poured all over the cake and the sweet cream ice cream was fantastic.\n\nPeanut Butter & Jelly Cobbler - My husband picked this based on our server's recommendation (the sticky toffee pudding was her first recommendation but she said this was her second choice since we wanted to order different things). This was way different then any cobbler I have ever had. But it wasn't a bad thing! The crumble part tasted kind of like a crumbled up peanut butter cookie and the filling was reminiscent of black berry jam. The jam was not overly sweet so it wasn't overwhelming at all. We actually really liked it.\n\nThe service was attentive and informative. Our drinks never got below half before someone came by to refill. I was nervous after seeing so many complaining reviews but again. After going to the restaurant I really have no idea what those reviews are talking about. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who was visiting or simply wanted to try Gordon Ramsey's food without paying the steak house prices. \n\nWe will be trying his Burgr restaurant next!"

The first time I tried Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill I was looking for something affordable yet indicative of the reputation of Gordon Ramsay.  \n\nI looked the eatery up on the website and decided that a great way to test the waters would be to stop in for lunch.  We had a reservation, but we arrived early.  They sat us right away.  The atmosphere was interesting and industrial.  Large beer kegs lined the walls and pictures of Ramsay scattered the hallway.  There was a punk feel and a deliberately English design with emphasis on reds.  \n\nMy husband had a burger and I had bangers and mash.  For appetizers we had the soft pretzels and I had the onion soup.  When I tried the English ale onion soup I was furious.  I am a 41 year old woman.  I have been cooking for over 20 years and I managed a commercial cookware store.  I'd like to think I know a thing or two about cooking.  That soup... it was so light.  The cheese on the croutons was so creamy.  My heavy, rich onion soup made with red wine pales in comparison.  The onions were sweet and perfectly caramelized just so slightly.  What a difference.  It occurred to me that that everything I thought I knew about cooking was absolutely 2nd rate.  It also was a portent or the next to come.  Sausages so flavorful and delicate... I was expecting heavy, filling pub food.  I received a delightful surprise.  The wait staff was expedient and attentive.  I was happy with the portions.  I didn't need a take home box at all.    \n\nBecause of this experience my husband and I went right on Facebook and told everyone what an amazing time we had.  Of course when my cousin was in town for a sales meeting from Boston recently, it gave us the perfect excuse to return.  I spoke of that onion soup all the way there.  I've been searching for that recipe to no avail!\n\nAgain we arrived early and again we were seated immediately.  Boy was it busy!  We still had an attentive waitstaff though and my glass was never empty.  Music like Joy Division played and our waiter brought a round of ale.  He asked if we were in a hurry.  We said no and proceeded to work our way through roasted vegetables, smelt, scallops, onion soup, shepherd's pie and sticky toffee pudding.     \n\nEVERYTHING was amazing.  It was an experience to savor and although the restaurant was quite busy, we never felt rushed even though we were there for about 2 hours.  The next day I asked my cousin if I could bring some sushi up to her hotel.  She said she was in meetings all day then would fly back to Boston.  I said maybe next time then.  She said next time she comes to Las Vegas we're eating at Gordon Ramsay's again.  Forget sushi!"

Well, this shit wasn't far from it!  We came in for happy hour and it was less than impressed. Service was slow, yet they were not even close to being busy. Our sever took at least 10 minutes before she greeted us. We did notice she enjoyed visiting the staff more than serving guests.  When she did come to see us we ordered asap since we did not know when she was going to come back. We each ordered the the $5 pulled pork sandwich. It was tiny for $5 and the flavor was not there. We also ordered onion rings and those were served with some kind of port demi sauce.  What the heck was that?  It said on the menu and aioli.  We asked the sever if the demi sauce was right and she said no. So she replaced it later when we only had two onions rings left.  Oh goodie.  We also ordered the wedge salad which is $16.  Now, when you order a wedge salad, it comes with a blue cheese dressing. Why in the world would it come out soaked in a vinaigrette on top of blue cheese dressing?  Is that a British thing?  The combination of the two was not good.  I can't say we plan on returning due to poor service and so-so food.  We were both really surprised that the food and service wasn't up to par since Gordon Ramsay was at Caesar's Palace the following day for the 50th anniversary of the casino."

So, we told the servicer, who quietly took the glass away and bought my wife another glass. Again, the glass had a sticky film inside. So, we told the servicer and that's when the attitude started. He took the glass without any apology and disappeared for well over 10 minutes. So, we started to leave, when the host called the manager, Randell Goldich, who saved our evening by one apologizing, and two, by providing a server (Stacy B.), who gave us exceptional service thorough the dinner service. The food was excellent. I'll will definitely return to one of my favorite TV celebrity's (Gordon Ramsay) restaurant. This is a clear case of not allowing one bad apple to spoil the bunch."

In the waiter's defense I did see him show this meat to the manager..stabbing at it as if to say ...see? and  no they didn't attempt to charge us for it.. they offered to make more but we were leery so alas we left  with our appetites only whetted. Kind of fun atmosphere, and nice waiter.. but oh Gordon how can you justify being so rude when your own cooks don't have it together?"

If you request sauce on the side or any substitutions they don't do it. All they say is I'm sorry. I didn't send it back because I didn't want to wait the same time. Server never followed up with us for more drinks. Which is was disappointing. With all the competition around I would come here again. Lacks service. The only happy guy around was the hostess and Busser."

For appetizer we had the fantastic Duck Confit Poutine. it was so good all the way to bottom where there is more confit..

I had the irish beef cheek stew which  I could eat 5 times a week and still crave it. it is so wonderful.  Service is good"

Their signature salad was not seasoned well and the ingredients didn't compliment each other. I had the beef tenderloin that was not seasoned at all and I was very disappointed. My cousin had the ribeye and it was more seasoned and had a better flavor. The service was slow and it took us 2 hours from the time we sat down until they brought us our checks Also we had a specialty cake and we were charged $3 per slice but they didn't cut or help serve the cake, for them to hold the cake which was a bit ridiculous since we spend over $60 per person here and we had 15 people I our party. If you have a choice for the price I would say skip the restaurant unless you really want a $15 burger. But hey it's Vegas!"

Also the ridicule salad part ( mix with arugula ) was very sandy or harder then normal. However the beet part and the goat cheese part along with the dressing was nice. \n\n\nThe order was beer battered fish -- cough 29.00$ I shure Gordon you don't offer that price in your England restaurants. was good \n\nMy dad got a medium temp burger that was done on the rarer side - witch put him off . however ingredients mixed nicely. \n\nMine well -- ( ale pie ) the filling was amazing however I was thinking it would be more like the shepherds pie with piped mashed potatoes like Gordon Ramsey always to have tips on his other then his hair lol. But the filling aspect was great however the mashed made it feel more like a meat chicken pot pie taste .. ( dont get me wrong it was good I am not shure the topping is wright. ) \n\nSpotted dc ( yes I abbreviated it ) lol . was great -- I know they stress on that. \n\nOverall 3 meals a little confusion with seating etc. -- Also we where set back in the part with tvs for the game -- Witch was blaring -- I am 30 not old - couldn't even hear our server \n\nI would be willing to give it another review at a latter date - due to fact I love hells kitchen. but will be back since I am a local know well obiv with over 80 something reviews in las vegas."

The first bite I took was filled with creamy savory feta and carmalized onions that just make u think of being on vacation and remembering the first step u took out of the plane watching the sun set in the horizon. Yes it was like an oasis in my mouth accompanied by a savory but lean and juicy lamb patty that was perfectly spiced. The lamb was so delicious I had to buy the chef a shot of patron. Kudos chef ramsey. I was so stuffed that I couldn't make room for dessert. So I excused myself from the table and threw up in the restroom so i could have some of their world famous bread pudding.  I cant even begin to describe the bread pudding. Its consistency was more like a cake that crumbled as it touch my lips. The ice cream was light and whipped with crunchy peanut brittle that made me pause from reading shades of gray. Yes it was that good.  Chef ramsey left my loins on fire. Kudos!!!!"

I intend to rate it 4.5 stars, but kind of hard to swallow the .5, so, I'll leave it at 4 stars, due to couple reasons. \nIf I'm bringing a group of six adults for dinner after the CES convention week, I just assumed this will be a great place to experience the actual GR food. No to mention, two of my guests are GR fans, so, why not give it a try, right? \nThe overall food experience was good, I wish I could've said great! I first ordered the calamari as to share appetizer, and the truffle fries, which I thought is a great way to start a meal. Especially if GR had been showing how crispy he likes to make them calamari. Well...I didn't expect it to have seen the calamari to have so much tendons, AND not being somewhat crispy as I'd had hoped for. As few of us tried it, it really turned out to be a bit soft and chewy. So, we had to send it back, and ordered something else instead. \nAnyways, aside to the bad calamari, the food we ordered were delicious, we had the burgers, and few of the folks ordered the steak. It was a lot of food, but we managed to finish. \nOur server was friendly and super courteous, but perhaps they need to pay more attention to the cleanliness of their sections! Not a Ramsay standard, I'd say! ;)\nThe booth we got sat in, the seats weren't wiped clean, the floor were dirty and not swept properly. I understand the concept is to be a pub and setting is to be as if we are to eat inside a London pub...But, if we're to spend $45 on a Ribeyes, I'd consider that being a steak house, right? \nSo, aside to the chewy calamari and cleanliness, I do enjoy the rest of the food served after, as well the rest of the folks in my table. \n#foodporn #cleanmuch #GordonRamsay #Standard #VegasRestaurant"

Main courses were nothing special the flat iron steak was disappointing basically a fancy way of saying fried -undercooked on the inside burnt black on the outside I'd say that was quite an accomplishment if it wasn't my food. Wife had the fingerling potatoes that the waiter suggested we're the best potatoes he's ever had. My guess is that he hasn't had many potatoes then. They were very bland. One of our number had the fish and chips and seemed moderately happy with it though so perhaps only 5/6 people leave disappointed.

As soon as we sat down I noticed Randi replacing our utensils with another set of clean utensils. He caught me looking at him when he did this and responded to me by saying \"Sorry, those weren't shiny enough  ...Talk about someone being on top of their game. \nRandi then introduced us to our waiter/server, Taylor. We chitchatted for a few seconds on how our day was and then proceeded to ask him his recommendations. We started with the lobster rolls. I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE lobster, but I have reservations in regards to ordering it in cities that are far from the ocean, however the meat on these rolls were absolutely delicious. One order between my husband and I definitely was not enough. \nFor our main course I got the Fish and Chips and while my husband ordered the BANGERS & MASH for himself. My meal was extremely tasty. The fish was extremely tender and did not have that oily after taste many other Fish and Chips meals come with. My assume husband enjoyed his meal as well as he did not even offer me a bite of his dinner. \nWe definitely stuffed our faces during dinner and as embarrassing as this sounds, we did also end up ordering dessert, which was definitely unnecessary but extremely worth it. Their pudding cake is to die for. It is a must when visiting this restaurant.\nAll in all I can honestly say I had a really great experience dining here. The service was way above average. Randi and Taylor are absolute gems and made our experience wonderful. \nTaylor made sure our glasses were never empty, our food was hot when it arrived  and continuously asked us if we needed anything else throughout our dining experience. \nWe are planning another trip with our entire family in the next few weeks to Vegas and we cannot wait to bring everyone back here to experience the awesome food. \n5 STARS !!!!!!!"

Bar service was average, but the free appetizer was very good (pretzels w/ dips - not good just because it was free.)\n\nSecond visit - dinner with my lady. Great service and average food. I had the shepherds pie. Good, but expected great for the price. Pint of Lagunitas IPA was $11..... \n\nThird visit - just about midnight and the hostess asked if I just wanted drinks. As my answer was yes, I followed the group of 4 that were just ahead of me into the bar area. The main bar was full, so I took a seat at the end of the adjacent bar, a mere 5 feet from the main bar.  With a slight lean, I could have touched the shoulder of the gentlemen at the end.  After waiting for about 5 minutes and repeated eye contact with the main bar bartenders, a lady came up to let me know they were closed.  So I asked why the hostess showed me in... I was told they may be open at the main bar... 5ft away... But as far as she knew, they were closed.\n\nMy disappointment comes from 2 directions:\n\n- big name with a reputation, I had high expectations.  Didn't come close.\n\n- outspoken critic of poor restaurants is failing at this location. Might want to pay a visit to the establishment with your name on it...\n\nOn the other hand - Ramsay's Burgr at Planet Hollywood is FABULOUS.

The waiter must have been scared to do his job because he kept glancing at our table and not stopping by. I watched him pass about 4 times before asking if we wanted water (uhm yes, it's Vegas and we need to stay hydrated), another 4 times before asking if we wanted drinks, and another 6 times before finally bringing them. He literally forgot to bring the beer and then quickly left again when we were clearly ready to order. It wasn't a busy night, so his flightiness was unexplainable. \n\nThis continued throughout the night. We needed salt/pepper, and the waiter continued to walk by hesitantly and not stop by asking how we are doing and if we needed anything. This might not seem like a huge deal, but no paying customer wants to feel avoided or neglected. \n\nAlso, he'll need to brush up on his adjectives and food reviews. When we asked about how their pea soup tasted, his only response was \"it has texture.\" WOW you sold us on that one. \n\nFor Gordon Ramsay's name.. The staff needs better game. Very surprising..\n\nThe steak was pretty fatty. I was starving at that point (since the waiter took a lifetime to commit to his job) and would've ate anything."

Certainly he has become quite the star by informing chefs and restauranteurs in no uncertain terms why their food or dining establishment falls short of his professed high standards. So naturally on a recent visit to caesers I felt drawn to his namesake pub, to see how it was living up to those standards. \nI must sadly report that it fell way short. We were there for a happy hour so got to sample a variety of items, and not one of them was in any way noteworthy. I recall a dry as bones slider, a pastry wrapped \"toad in the hole\" sausage that can be best described as insipid, some very ordinary \"chips,\" or fries as we deem them west of the pond, and a few items than even now, just a few days later, have already faded from my gastro memory. \nPerhaps an earlier yelper was correct in stating that Ramsay himself should get in here and start yelling at people, but until he does I suggest you limit your patronage here to a couple of pints."

We were seated on the side near the walkway\n\nTruffle Chips - They are huge!!  They are about 1in x 1in x 3in.  I heard they are boiled, baked, and deep fried to give it that wonderful consistency.  The Truffle Chips are special because they drizzle it with wonderful scrumptious truffle oil and top it off with truffle shavings.  There are also two dipping sauces one tomato based and the other has a creamier consistency\n\nPub Lamb Burger - This burger comes with a good sized lamb patty that is cooked to order.  Topped with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  It was wonderful!  You also get a side of their giant chips.  If you are a beer drinker I recommend pairing it with a bottle of Delirium :)\n\nI took off one star because of the tight seating situation.

Try \"You Don't Know From a Nightmare Until You've Sat at Your Own Bar, Gordon Ramsay.\"\n\nWe went to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill this evening to watch the NBA Playoffs. Things started off well enough--we though the fish and chips were a bit greasy and way overpriced, and the french fries tasted burnt, but this was our first time at this restaurant, so we just thought that they were prepared strangely. When someone next to us was served the same dish, we realized that our french fries HAD been burned beyond all recognition.\n\nWe were having a fun time with the bartenders--lots of laughing and jokes. However, one of the bar backs, Antoine, followed my girlfriend when she went to the bathroom. Antoine, is a large, menacing character, and she was not comfortable with his aggressive behavior. When she came back from the bathroom, he came out from the back and handed her his phone number. Later, he said, \"You better not have thrown that number away. You better call me or you can't ever come in here again.\"\n\nAt the end of the evening, one of the bartenders, Keith, put two drinks in front of us that we did not order, and said, \"Try this.\" We assumed that he wanted us to try a new drink he was working out--we are very familiar with bars, and it wouldn't be the first time that a bartender had asked us to try his drink. I did not care for mine, so I wasn't drinking it. When Antoine came out again, he said, \"What's wrong?\" I said that I did not like it. Antoine then proceed to PICK UP MY DRINK, DRINK OUT OF THE STRAW, AND PUT THE DRINK BACK IN FRONT OF ME. I sat, mouth agape with incredulity astounded by his presumptuousness, and all I could manage to utter was, \"I don't want that.\" He then took the drink and said, \"I can't drink this out here, but I will take it in the back. Thanks for the drink!\" I have never seen anything like this. As I type this, I still cannot fathom that a server (or any other human being) would drink out of a stranger's drink. IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?!?!? Especially in the context of a server and a customer. My head almost exploded. I supposed that it is fortuitous that I was intimidated by Antoine because that spared everyone from me causing a scene.\n\nI called immediately after leaving the restaurant/bar. When I asked to speak to the manager, the hostess who answered the phone said, \"Sure! What's your name, Hun?\" I am a doctor and a college professor. \"Hun?\" What year is this?\n\nWhen I spoke the the manager, there was no greeting on the phone, he just said, \"Zeus.\" It took a few seconds for me to understand that he was actually stating his name, and I wasn't transferred to the wrong number. When I told Zeus the story, his response was, \"So, I don't understand--are you saying that Antoine threatened you?\" Hopeless--these people are all so hopeless. Zeus assured me that he would take our last two drinks off of the bill and tell the regional manager about Antoine's behavior. I am not really sure how that is an appropriate response to this horrific situation. \n\nSo, I guess we won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, because my friend has no interest in calling Antoine--she couldn't afford to pay for all of his drinks all night anyway."

The food was so good and you really can't go wrong! The drink menu had a lot of variety. I'm usually a beer drinker, but I wanted to try something different this time. The Salted Caramel Apple Martini was my favorite!"

We waited a good 20 minutes before anyone came to greed us. 30 more seconds and I was ready to walk out - wish I kinda wish I had. Again took the server forever to bring our drinks. Didn't even bring the basket of bread until AFTER our main entree already came (although the bread tasted good, unfortunately it was too late for it). I had a salad which was ok. My fianc\u00e9 had the burger which he said \"sucked\". His entree plate had a little container that was supposed to have ketchup in it but it was empty. Took them another 5 mins to bring that out... Just not what you are looking for sitting at a restaurant. You want to relax and have a good time. Not spend the entire night waiting on your service. I could tell the people sitting at table next to us were having the same issues - their eyes were wondering around looking for the waiters. When the check came, we didn't bother paying by card, just left some cash and got out! Disappointed."

I loved that the brioche they were served on also had a faint lemon taste. \n\nFor my lunch I selected to the Pub Chopped Salad which I loved. Everything in the salad was finely diced so I did not need to use my knife, and the dressing was light and evenly distributed. \n\nThe only downside to the pub was the seating.

Heather went above and beyond and arranged for us to meet Kristin (how cool!!) Kristin comes out to the table and talks to us for a bit and then takes pictures with us!  Everyone was so amazing and helpful all night. \n\nI didn't even mention the food and drinks yet! So there were four of us there and we weren't super hungry so we decided to go for a few different shared plates.  We started out with the nachos - I was thinking \"how good can nachos be, and what kind of special twist can you put on nachos...\" But at Pub they were amazing - the chips were a different twist and really brought it all together!  Then we had the pigs and a blanket which were hands down the best pigs and a blanket I've ever had!  I want to talk about all of the food I had but it was all just to amazing!

Zero pink and no juices flowing from the steak. It took 10 minutes to track down the waitress who didn't seem surprised and said it looked more like a medium well vs medium rare. If she thinks dark grey is medium well, she probably should look into a different career path. It took 25 minutes to receive a replacement steak, which is ridiculous. They should have taken the next steak off the grill. The manager acted like he was doing us a favor by removing the steak from the bill, despite the fact that it was delivered after every other dish had been cleared from our table. \n\nThis was an embarrassing effort from a restaurant with a celebrity name and $100 per head prices for food and a couple drinks.

I kept encountering small bits of shells in the lobster mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was meh. It was overly salty, watery, and not cheesy. The lobster in it was dry and tasted fishy. I had made a much better Costco take home mac n cheese for $10 that fed 15 people a week prior.  I tried the shepherd pie and it was ok....watery but not bad. I told our waiter about the shells and he seemed offended that I was complaining about my friend almost CRACKING/SPLITTING her tooth from eating a small roll. I had only finished half my mac n cheese so I wanted to take it home to add my own cheese and recreate the entire dish. No point in wasting food when there are starving kids in the world. The server ended up throwing out my food. I assumed he was going to box it up since he asked us if we wanted to box up our food and we said yes, turns out he was only directly addressing two people and unfortunately in our group of 6, I was not one of them. He did offer to remake my food (of course begrudgingly and offended that we were inconveniencing him with the shell-bit food that he accidentally threw out). However we were rushing to make a flight home so I didn't have time for them to remake it. For $22, I could have bought 2 Costco mac n cheeses that tastes insanely better and can feed 24 people.  Just sayin...I should have went to Mesa Grill  :*("

Randy brought Chef Wilson to the table to meet my wife, which obviously went over great!  I'm in the music business, and we had a great conversation. All of our food and drinks - beginning with the Scotch Egg - were amazing. The fish and chips are truly a masterpiece.

I ended up ordering the mini-pub burgers as my meal. They were OK. One of the girls had the scallops and really enjoyed those as well. But that was about it for the positives.\n\nOne member of our party asked about the curry chicken, which the server said was very good. She probed as to how hot or spicy it was, and the server said it really wasn't at all. \n\nIt took FOREVER for our meals to come, without any real update from our server. Finally, 5 of 6 meals came and the server didn't address the missing 6th meal. Finally, we caught his attention and asked what was going on. Apparently the kitchen missed the 6th order, which happened to be a steak so it was taking even longer to come out. After one bite of the curry chicken, our friend knew it was verrrryyy hot. The server mentioned it also came with a jelly to \"cool the spices\" and that was nowhere to be seen. She actually looked to be in pain trying to eat her meal.\n\nMy husband had the grilled beef burger, and he said it was just OK. \n\nTo top it off, our waiter put everything on one bill. We had a party of 6, very clearly 3 couples. He couldn't take the time to separate it onto 3 separate bills?\n\nI'm going to assume Gordon Ramsay doesn't spend much time checking in on the performance of this restaurant. We eat out a lot, and have rarely had an experience this poor. I honestly wish we would have just gone to the Cheesecake Factory!"

All the food on the happy hour menu is from $5 - $7, which is pretty decently priced for the richness of the selection. You do have to sit at the bar, which was super crowded on this cold November Tuesday, but if you can manage to find a spot it'll be worth your while. \n\nEach dish was delicious! We were blown away. They were all classic happy hour appetizer type foods (nachos, wings, etc) but made with better quality and a slight twist of the fancy. The type of food you can eat until you're full and not feel like you're going to pass out after, you just feel good. \n\nHere's the dishes: \nTruffle Chips: Basically, fries with truffle aioli. The fries are super good, those thick but not too thick ones that are just crispy enough. The truffle, and the other dipping sauce, was flavorful too. \n\nToad-in-the-Hole: A sausage wrapped in a pastry with dipping sauce in swirls around the plate. Fluffy, pastry with perfect balance of sausage. This dish only comes with one tiny sausage for a $5 price tag, so just be warned if you're sharing you'd need to order a few more if you want your own. \n\nCrab Deviled Egg (w/ cucumber, tomato, relish): This was good, the flavors were balanced. I'm a hug fan of regular deviled eggs, so the twist was definitely interesting. Not my favorite, but good and definitely worth the try! (They come with three egg halves). \n\nKettle Chip Nachos (w/ corned short ribs & cheddar sauce): SO GOOD, probably my favorite dish. It's everything good about nachos but with better made parts. The chips by themselves are the real potato kind, the meat is flavorful enough to eat on it's own, and the cheddar sauce is rich. It all balances super well, especially with the sweet baked peppers on the top (I think that's what they are). It was so good we were literally scrapping every last tiny bite off the plate even though it was our last dish of the meal. \n\nLollipop Wings (w/ Blue Cheese Dip): SO MUCH YES. Comes with 6 wings."

I am already looking forward to the next visit. \n\nWe chose to eat at the bar since a couple of basketball games were on.  That way we could also ask the bartender about their beer selection.  Our bartender let us sample a few and we ended up going with a pints of Innis & Gunn and Moa.  Those were $8.75 each but so was Pacifico and Corona so no point in going for stuff you can get anywhere else.   \n\nThe first entree was the \"Dublin Brisket\" which was set in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The bowl was filled with hearty tender chunks of beef, cheese and sauerkraut that went well with the side of thousand island.  3 standard steak fries=1 fry here so you only get 4 of them which was enough.  \n\nMy wife wanted the \"Shepard's Pie\" and just hearing those two words gave me flashbacks of terrible school cafeteria mush, a poor man's English lasagna if you will.  But this was galaxies away from what I had in the past.  Savory was the word from the first bite.  Each spoonful filled with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots, peas and slow cooked beef and lamb.  A truly awesome dish that I would gladly have any cold weather day.  \n\nWe skipped all the good looking appetizers and small plates just to make it to dessert.  Everyone recommended the \"Sticky Toffee Pudding\" so that's what we had and it did not disappoint.  The perfect ending indeed."

Mind you, there were tables everywhere but we did as we were told. Once seated, our baby was sleeping and would have remained asleep had our waiter not taken it upon himself to move her stroller from where the hostess told us we could park it. From the get go, our server was visibly irritated that we would have the audacity to bring a baby to this restaurant. From there it went from bad to worse. Here are some highlights... the food (corn soup, English peas) was not even warm; anytime we asked for anything (a straw, a glass of cranberry juice, an oyster fork) we never got it; HORRIBLE service combined with lackluster food does not justify a $256 price tag. When the manager asked how our experience was we were honest and told him and he responded by offering free dessert which we took to go. The one menu item I'd recommend is the sticky toffee pudding."

They state how awesome the batter KS but with peices so large you miss out. \n\nLong story short, I'd rather fly to England for $1,000 bucks, take a 40 pound cab ride to Mildenhall Village and eat at the dog track than to recommend anyone eating here. \n\nI'm a Vegas local and I only write reviews if I love or hate a place. The two stars is Bc I like the mushy peas"

Second time I had the Salmon, cooked as expected, crispy skin , tender and flavorful. The sides was very nice with a puree and veggies. My guest had the chicken also very good and tasty, but the hamburger was just Ok. Quality of the food is good and fallows Ramsay standards, but a bit pricy for the quantity. I feel the sides were not enough and the portion on the small side.  Staff was very nice but the place is a bit noisy."

I'd say we are both \"amateur\" foodies, but we will go out of our way for good food, never fast food.  \n\nThe food was great, and a vey ample selection of beer, wine and drinks to choose from- that thankfully they condensed by using an iPad- making it much easier to navigate than a bulky menu.\n\nWe shared the duck confit, my husband ordered the beef short rib and cheek sandwich, and I had the fish and chips.  The duck was so tender and sweet, no gamey after taste at all.  My husbands sandwich looked beautiful and the small piece he shared with me tasted wonderful, my fish was amazing.  It was so light and wasn't greasy.  (A silly side note... the ketchup is AMAZING- and I normally hate ketchup)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying it's expensive or that they had long wait times or that portion sizes aren't huge....  my husband is a decent sized guy, 6'5\" and a good 250 lbs and his meal was enough to satisfy.  I am much smaller and almost never can finish my plate, but I could finished this one and we both had room for the BEST dessert ever.... the Sticky Toffee Pudding is definitely a recommendation.  \n\nI, personally, appreciated that it wasn't an over sized portion.  Mainly because I hate not finishing my plate and not having any place to store leftovers (our room didn't have a fridge).  \n\nThe price was on par with all things Vegas in my opinion (at least on the strip).  For the food, the experience and the atmosphere are worth it."

We didn't want to spend too much money since we had mistakenly come to Caesar's looking for Ramsey's BURGR and decided to eat here since we were starving.\n\nWe were seated behind the wall of beer kegs which was awkward since the table was raised and we were technically sharing the table with another group on the other side. The table was also weirdly wide and the place was noisy so we couldn't have much conversation. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and I had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is a side dish. The fish and chips was surprisingly big. The fish was well seasoned and still moist. With the tartar sauce they tasted really good. The fries were also nice and crisp and well seasoned. The house made ketchup was really good. The lobster Mac n' cheese was a bit underwhelming. The noodles were a nice al dente and the bechamel sauce was rich and creamy but I was expecting more lobster for the price (ridiculously $21). And it was still side dish size. I had maybe 1 small piece of  lobster for every 7 bites which is too small a ratio to call it lobster Mac n' cheese if you ask me! Also could have used more cheese, but I guess that's personal preference. \n\nFor the pub atmosphere and the pub quality grub, Ramsey should definitely consider lowering the prices."

I had the short rib cheese steak, this is the first time I had short ribs prepared like a cheese steak.  It was original and delicious.  The short rib was perfectly seasoned and had a horseradish sauce while delicious, it made the sandwich a little spicy.  The caramelized onions and red peppers complemented the dish.  The fries were prepared as small wedges and baked, topped with parmesan cheese, this was such a simple but delicious concept!  Be warned before you eat here you are going to pay. While the prices are high the food quality is defiantly worth it.  If you stay away from alcohol your average price per person will run between $15-30 for lunch.  The only thing stopping me from a 5 star rating was the stow service."

I preferred the bar because there were TVs and I like to socialize with the bartenders. However these bartenders were not very friendly. They seemed cold and was all business. We asked to change a channel on a TV to watch one of the March Madness games since there were at least 2 other TVs that were showing the same game. Not sure if they heard us or not, but no response. Finally after asking several times, one of the bartenders said that they had to ask the manager if they can change the channel. However, no urgency to go ask the manager. He just stood there doing something with the register. O-Kay... \n\nAs the night progressed, the bartenders got a little bit more socialable. They recommended the poutine with duck. It was A-Mazing! We had few Magic Hat beers which was a perfect match the to poutine. \n\nOverall, the service needs a bit more help. The restaurant is great for any sports enthusiast. Lots of TV and some tables had their own TVs! I only had the duck poutine but was ridiculous good!"

My app and entree was very good as were my buddies'. \n\n I read some comments on here, which are really short sighted. Of course it is expensive - you are in Vegas and at Caesers Palace. I paid $5.90 for a large coffee at the damn food court nearby. Everything is over priced there. Room service for 2 burgers at Caesars was about $75 so compared to room service this is a bargain.\n\nThe staff seemed disoriented and somewhat aloof. Not sure what the culture is there, but it is different from the other GR places I've been.\n\nAnyway the place is pretty cool and tv's are everywhere. \n\nIt isn't worth making an extra effort to go if you are staying far away but if you are staying at an adjacent property it is worth going to."

Explains to me everything about the pub, and drinks they have as well as the food. Now I'm a big Chef Ramsey fan and I've seen his dishes at the pub on his shows that he did in Europe and I was extremely excited to finally get to try it. \n\nI had his signature Shepard's pie. OMG! Amazing! The beef and lamb stew with the creamy potato layer on top was fantastic. The meet was very very tender and had so much flavor. I also tried his signature fish and chips. By far the best fish and chips I've had! Big tender flaky fish fried to perfection with a light crispy batter. The crunch on the outside was great. The batter was thin and lots of fish on the inside! Amazing! The fries were just as good. Any time you get fresh cut fries it's always good! For dessert again I got his signature sticky toffee pudding. This one is similar to his steak restaurant. Served hot but with out the brown butter ice cream like the the steakhouse restaurant. Came with a vanilla ice cream. \n\nI had an amazing time at all 3 of his restaurants in Vegas. The food is amazing, he really knows his food and it shows. I'm definitely a bigger fan now!"

They come by to put breadsticks plates out with no breadsticks so now we have plates and nothing else and it's been over 20 minutes.  We get our main dishes before drinks or breadsticks and my shepard's pie is cold.  Can we at least get some water please?  Finally get our first beer when we are almost done with our meals.  How hard is it to pour a beer?  After we finish our food and our beers and water are completely gone, along comes some breadsticks.  I don't need these anymore and I wanted a bunch of beers since it is a pub.  No one ever asked us if we wanted another beer so we just got a check and grumpily moved on.

            "review": "Sometimes the greatest triumphs are born from disasters, and our visit to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesars Palace was no exception. This review's a bit long, but trust me, it really hits its stride around paragraph eight.\n\nMy girlfriend and I wandered into the restaurant on Saturday, March 7th, lured in by a sign at the entrance advertising some pretty appealing happy hour deals. The deals were so enticing that we failed to notice the not-so-fine print indicating happy hour only occurred M-F. Oh well. \n\nWe approached the host stand and were immediately greeted warmly by Randy Goldich, who we came to find out later is Bar Manager for GRP&G. Randy was a great host and was incredibly accommodating upon learning that my girlfriend was not only vegetarian, but also allergic to wheat. He brought us a gluten-free menu and even gave us happy hour pricing on our Angry Orchard cider/Fireball shot combos (also known as Angry Balls...you gotta try). And that's where things started to fall apart...\n\nI ordered the fish and chips, and the GF ordered the vegetarian blah blah whatever sandwich with gluten free bread. The food didn't arrive until the Angry Balls had already done a number on us, so we were ravenous. As I stuffed my face with fish I couldn't help but notice that my GF's gluten-free bread looked remarkably like...bread. We called our waitress Nini over, and she was incredibly apologetic and immediately took the sandwich back to the kitchen.\n\nAs we waited for the sandwich to be fixed, two more ciders were mistakenly delivered to our table (not a complaint), and suddenly it felt like we were in a rotating restaurant. But boy did we make friends with all the staff! We met waiter Marvin, who recently won Caesars employee of the year, and yukked it up with Tom Tom (or was it Ray Ray?), their award winning mixologist. We were practically falling off our stools by the time the replacement sandwich came, but it finally did: a beautiful vegetarian, gluten-free sandwich wrapped in lettuce and filled with...chicken.\n\nBy this time I was forced to relinquish my own hand-cut fries (apparently they call them \"chips\" in Vegas) due to the girlfriend's voracious state, and the potatoes did a good enough job of soaking up the fermented apple juice that we were ready to call it an afternoon. Randy was apparently tied up in the kitchen, so manager Michelle came by the table and let us know that our meal was free. She also sent us off with the correct order in a to-go container, 2 1/2 hours after we had initially arrived for a light lunch.\n\nLess than an hour after leaving the restaurant, I received a call on my cell phone from Randy, who apologized profusely and invited us back for dinner the following night as his guests. I was initially shocked as to how Randy had gotten my number, but then the GF reminded me of my tendency to hand out business cards to everyone I talk to after imbibing a few cocktails.\n\nTo say we were shocked at his offer would be an understatement. We're not high-rollers; we're not even the lint in Dean Martin's belly button. But if there was anything that we learned after chatting with our boy Randy, it's that the man takes a genuine vested interest in his customers' happiness. It's not about Yelp reviews or who can tip the most; it's about making every guest feel like they had a remarkable experience. It's an old-school approach to service and building customer relationships that seems to be lost on so many that work in hospitality nowadays. So obviously, we took him up on his offer for dinner.\n\nWe returned at 9:30 the following evening and came to figure out that even though Randy's scheduled shift had ended several hours earlier, he made it a point to stay until we were seated and served the meals we ordered. He put us under the tender loving care of waiter Roger, and introduced us to season 12 winner of Hell's Kitchen Scott Commings, who can whip up a meatless wedge salad like you wouldn't believe. Even after we declined dessert, Roger still brought us every single gluten-free dessert option on the menu! It turns out that vanilla ice cream was really the only option that fit the criteria, but we were impressed nonetheless.\n\nAfter two experiences in two days with GRP&G, I was left with two very distinct lasting impressions: 1) Randy Goldich is a pretty incredible guy, and he and his staff will apparently do whatever it takes to make their guests happy, and 2) this is definitely the most awesome thing that has ever come from dating a gluten-free vegetarian. Because of our experience, we actively look forward to visiting Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill next time we visit Las Vegas."

I had the sliders and my husband had a ham and cheese sandwich.  I hope Ramsey keeps his eye on this place to keep it up to par. I've read several poor reviews that I think would get his ire up! Maybe better training of the staff? Our experience was great."

We were seated around 1PM on a Friday, and our server did not come over until 20 minutes or so after.  Then after he took our order, he came back and \"confirm\" our order.  Basically, he forgot our second entree order.  Anyhow, after waiting close to half an hour, I was about to blow a gasket.  I asked the waiter to check on our food, he said it is coming.  He served our entrees first before our mussels and clams appetizer.\n\nThe mussels tasted like mud, not fresh and tender.  It was just very musky.  The bacon burger was just ok, nothing real special about it.  It was under favored.  For $19, I expected a bit more.  Then the Steak and ale pie also lacked in favor.  Marie callendar's chicken pot pie tasted better than this.  I still can't believe I tipped the server.\n\nThe restaurant decor was nice, but the food and service really stinks."

Do not expect better quality than you would from the food court or handful of other Caesar owned food spots within Caesars Palace. Gordon Ramsay's influence ended at accepting a check to put his name above the door. \n\nMy friend and I didn't believe the restaurant  could be as bad as the reviews claimed. It was worse.\n\nThe fish and chips were revolting. I said to my friend, at least the bad reviews usually say the mushy peas are good. FALSE. I managed 2-3 bites of each, as did my friend, before sending it back. The waitress acted like she was doing me a favor by comping it, which was also contingent upon her taking the plates right then. Pretty insulting.\n\nThe staff was incompetent and rude. They wandered around clueless of what they should be doing. They would form large packs then break apart and begin wandering again, only to reform the pack in another area.\n\nThe sound from the sub woofer which was conveniently located 5 FEET behind my friends chair was an added bonus. We asked that it be turned down. The manager had the waitress tell us \"No\". For the record my friend and I are guys, we were there to eat, drink and watch the games. When I say the sound was to loud, I'm saying we had to lean in and almost yell to converse. \n\nTo add insult to injury my St. Bernadus 12 was served with a plastic cup.\n\nThis was par for my overall experience with Caesars. Pathetic."

Oh and both my water glass and my friends were empty thru the dinner and never refilled or asked to be refilled. The waiter was no where to be found and it wasn't even that crowded. We dined there today, on a Sunday evening around 6-7pm. Oh and forgot to mention, they added a 18% gratuity for our group of 7, which we wouldn't have minded paying had we got 18% service! Overall we were all very disappointed and would not recommend this place however I would recommend his Burgr restaurant if your looking for a good burger and great service."

We had to ask him every time, as he did not leave it at, or near the table for us.  My hubby was looking forward to a nice burger...There is not a burger on the menu.  He goes to London twice a year, and said, there is no pub in London that doesn't have a burger on its menu.  When our meals arrived, we were very very surprised with the small portions.  The shephards pie portion looked like a small appetizer.  The guy that had it, said he had never been to a place where he had to fill up on bread.  The food was tasty, but very over priced for what you get.  The desserts were delicious.  About the only positive thing, all 4 of us had to say about the pub, was the dessert was good.  Service was very poor, and our waiter pretty much ignored us.  The next day, all 4 of us said, we would never go back again.  Very over rated.   I should also mention, we have been to Ramsays burger place in Planet Hollywood, and loved it.  Also to his fine dining steak house in the Paris, and loved it.  But never again to the pub"

John, our server was quick and never left the plates on the tables or drinks needing to be filled. We were torn as to what to select as the menu was amazing. John helped with some suggestions. We started with the calamari, which was tender and had great flavor. I had the Ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. My wife's entree of the double lamb chops had her cleaning off the bone! We shared with our entree what will be the item that makes us crave to return, the Lobster Mac and Cheese! Spectacular with its large chunks of lobster!

            "review": "I always keep an open mind when trying a new place. Especially having tried Gordon Ramsay Steak and loving it. With that said we were greeted by a cute chatty hostess to show us to our table. I liked the staffs outfits, dark wood decor and barrels stacked to create a wall between the bar and restaurant but I hated our table. The location was fine, but it was a high top with backless stools, I felt like a little kid and never felt comfortable. Request a booth, they look so comfy. We got food menus right away but had to wait for the drink menu, they brought us some water ( which wasn't the tastiest tap water) while we passed the one drink menu iPad around deciding what to drink. Doug was the only one getting a specialty cocktail, the Pub Crawl. It was light and tasty, I'd recommend it, he ended up getting a second one later. \nI had my heart set on a Scotch Egg but I noticed it wasn't on the menu, once we finally made our minds up on food I asked our waiter about the Scotch Egg, he said it's on the pub menu and offered to get us one. We waited and waited, when he finally came back, he asked if we were ready to order,  again I asked about the pub menu, he apologized and got us one within a minute. He seemed to discourage us from most things on the pub menu, not sure why? But I ended up getting the Scotch Egg which was very disappointing, it wasn't greasy, had a nice crunch but the sausage was dry and very spicy which overwhelmed the egg and I didn't care for dipping it in the hp sauce. I had one at another gastropub in town and it was tremendously better than Gordon's. \nWe had also received their free bread service which included 3 different pretzel bites and a rye roll with pots of butter and cheese. Having 4 people at our table I think we should've gotten 2 but we all shared so we could have a bit of everything. They were all very good, I would order it if it wasn't complimentary. One thing we thought was strange was we didn't get bread plates to eat our bread or share the apps. Very messy.\nWhen ordering our entrees, Doug was unsure on what to get and tried to get some help from the waiter, but it was one of those scenarios where they say everything is good but push the most expensive choice, not very helpful.\nOur entrees came not too long after our apps and bread. Crowding our already small table, they never removed the Scotch Egg dish. There was a Pork Belly Roll, the Lamb T-Bone, and 2 of us got the Fish and Chips. We sampled each dish. The Pork belly was very moist and tender but it didn't have much else going on. The lamb was okay but nothing special, I didn't taste any of the mint jus that was suppose to be present, the mustard on the side was strong with horseradish but it was good. The Fish was tender and not greasy with a decent crunch but it wasn't anything special either, I've had better fish and chips at an English pub in town. The \"chips\" were way too big, not crispy at all, I didn't like them. The mushy peas were really nice and fresh tasting though. I couldn't finish one of fish pieces so asked for it to packed up, I think in higher end places the waiter should box it for you, but maybe that's just me. I had to box it myself.  \nWe couldn't leave with out getting the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. It was really good. Sweet, moist, gooey, some crispy spots all with a side of sweet cream ice cream. Yum.\nThus far my impression was poor service, don't waste your time on an entree here (IMO go to his steakhouse instead), seems like a good spot for drinks, small bites/apps, and dessert. I have to say they were nice enough to allow us to hang out for awhile after dinner, they warned us they were closing for a private event so the place cleared out fast around us but let us stay til the last minute before they had to have everything ready. We were also well supplied with water, even though we had already paid and tipped. \n\nFor the prices and name on the door, I was disappointed. Gordon, say it ain't so!"

Being warmly greeted and seated quickly established my positive impression and the staff maintained the momentum. Our server, Joshua, arrived promptly and took exceptional care of us. \n\nWe started off with Spiced Cider and Sloe Bramble cocktails. The sweet cinnamon flavor of the cider hit the spot. I cannot recommend it enough! The Sloe Bramble was \"berry\" nice but lacking in the wow factor. I enjoyed rifling through the online bar menu on Joshua's tablet. \n\nThe Rib & Cheek Sandwich is beyond tender. It was flavorful and rich. The potatoes were huge and nicely seasoned on the outside with Parmesan cheese. \n\nThe Mac N Cheese is divine. I adore the truffle and tiny duck fat crouton topping. Just a luscious dish. \n\nFor dessert a must is the Sticky Toffee Pudding! Forgo the Chocolate Trifle and order two of the puddings! Don't worry about the servings being too big. They are just right. \n\nThank you Joshua for being so knowledgeable, quick to gauge customer tastes and just charming in general. The staff was sweet and pleasant all around.

Also, the people I was with wanted to eat there. \n\nI had an Innis & Gunn stout with the black truffle macaroni and cheese, which was EXCELLENT, and I've had macaroni and cheese in a billion places. The Scotch egg and salt and vinegar crisps (calling them that doesn't make them feel any more English than regular potato chips do, but I get it) appetizers were pretty spot-on... not amazing, but good drinking food. \n\nDrink, meal, and tip landed just over $40. Good on you, Gordon Ramsay, for not charging the hell out of people for food that doesn't really justify its price tag. It's sort of a foreign dining experience--I won't call it authentic, but dark, pub-like, with living room-style chairs that were awkwardly low versus the height of the table. Fun and easily satisfying for groups and drinkers.\n\nThe service was mediocre that night; our waiter disappeared for long stretches, I had to ask for a water refill; it wasn't the worst service I've had, but it didn't warrant a hefty tip.\n\nA couple days later, we stopped in again (The connected Forum Shoppes made us all tired... from all the shopping) for drinks. The bartender recommended cocktails from the menu, discussed each at length, and was super charming and attentive, even discussing other local restaurant recommendations and letting me sample a bit of a drink I asked about.\n\nIf you love English food (and I'm not sure anyone does), this place is doing it right enough to give it a shot."

The atmosphere was cool, server was really nice, and since we had made reservations, we didn't have to wait. \n\nWe got the Shepherd's Pie and the chicken, kale and bacon pot pie and they were surprisingly great portion sizes. Very filling and actually tasted amazing. \n\nI'm not much of a dessert person, but the snickerdoodle that we got was like nothing  I've ever had before.\n\nOverall, great experience. Alittle expensive but would you expect with a name like that and on the Strip?"

I guess they had a couple bad experiences there before but I really wanted to go because I was wanting a good beer n some simple unpretentious food.  I'm glad I went. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I started with the mushroom salad on a bed of fris\u00e9e. I really love mushrooms, so when I say four or five different kinds, I gasped, and dived in. I didn't come up for air until It was finished. Oh what fun that was. And the pretzels were a nice touch, I liked the mustard far better than the cheese, surprisingly. I ordered the chorizo mussels for dinner because I'm a big mussel fan and the waiter recommended it.  Very good even tho I hardly ate the chorizo bc that was the only part I wasn't interested in somehow. The broth was salty but savory and it was gigantic.  My friend got the pork belly which had wonderful flavor and the fat was super crispy, I liked it more than him I think. The other guest ordered the shepards pie and said it was great."

For example we had a burger and it was supposed to come with a dill pickle and pepperchini garnish. All they said was they ran out and that's it. I thought most restaurants would substitute something for that. It's a $20 burger that's worth $9 after this experience. Also the wait took an hour wait. Will not come back. Gordon better come back and fix this."

(Would have been nice to know.)  After waiting much too long our drinks arrived but we were certain the mojito was wrong-it was in a clear glass, no fresh mint to speak of.  My friend had a sip and she said it tasted like the pre-mixed drinks you can buy in the grocery store in a can.  That is where I suspected my greyhound came from as well judging by the taste-it was horrible.  But if you are going to charge $14 (?) for a mojito at least fake it by throwing in a spring of fresh mint...but mAybe that was too much work.  So, we ordered from the happy hour menu next thinking this was clearly not a mixed drink place-we should have paid attention to the keg-decor and impressive beer offering.  I happen to love IPAs and was excited to see Dog Fish Head on tap...but no...it was out.  It was only 4:00 or so!!  Okay, so I ordered  Stone IPA, also. Rey nice.  Strike two... \"Sorry-we are also out of that.\"  So the only other IPA was Lagunitas which I like.  At $5 (happy hour) it was a deal including the $5 nachos-over the top fattening but good.

S. so when we were planning our recent trip to Vegas, all I could hear in my head is Gordon yelling at me, \"You better eat at one of my restaurants, you f***ing donkey!\"   \n\nWith those inspiring words resonating in my head, I booked our first dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=P8fDK-wHe80_9pnT_mIrig ) for Thanksgiving dinner.  This also continued a recent tradition I like to call the \"Untraditional Thanksgiving.\"   It started a few years ago with a trip to Big Bear with a Chinese Thanksgiving and since then we have done Hawaiian and now British cuisine.\n\nOne of the things I like right away was the vibe of the place ... I really felt comfortable and at home.  The attention to detail was extensive including a wall mural ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=0jogkV5ZH0-crkb0wzAzeQ ) , the table settings ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=7PjeahRWVg8XaSlaEYzKMQ ) and menus.  Even the mix matched furniture just felt right in this restaurant.  And if the staff needs a reminder of who they work for ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=mN8dmXYi9mLK3T9tu9vCzg ), you have Chef Ramsay staring at you every time you leave or enter the kitchen!\n\nOnce we were seated at a half booth table, our server came over, took our drink order and introduced us to the menu.  The menu consists of Table Starters, Soups & Salads, Sandwiches & Burgers, Seasonal Choices, Pies, Oak-Fired Grill Entrees, Classic Entrees, Sides and Desserts.\n\nFor my wife, her entr\u00e9e was preordained weeks before the reservation and she chose the Classic Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=pLeX7KKtxHjHAVxFxtkWIg ) Substituting Mashed Potatoes with Chive Oil for the Chips, I decided to go with the Steak & Ale Pie ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=cxztqT6sQKUcvxwKCUb-dw ) and we split the Kettle Chip Nachos ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=3iew4HO_VJPYKtAeK9t_OA ) Starter item.\n\nThe Kettle Chip Nachos came to the table surprising hot and I think these were the first homemade chips that really impressed Laina.  Usually we would have some major complaints about the lack of short rib (very little) and corned beef (even less ... think nada), but the HP sauce (Tamarind based sauce with tomatoes, molasses and malt vinegar) really elevated the chips and there was a good amount of the other items.  Needless to say and to paraphrase Dr. Suess:  the one speck of food that we left on the plate was a crumb too small for a mouse to have ate!\n\nOur entrees came out shortly after we had wolfed down the nachos.  Laina liked the fish and said she could taste the ale in the batter, but was more impressed with the dill tarter sauce and sides.  Opting out of the chips for mashed potatoes was an excellent choice as the potatoes were perfectly whipped and the chive oil was a great compliment.  Usually Laina will ask for extra butter with her mashed potatoes, but no butter was requested on this occasion.  Her only regret was there could have been more chive oil with the potatoes.  She was also a fan of the mushy peas and thought the vest of lemon was a great addition without being too acidic.\n\nMy steak and ale pie was a well balanced dish, just a bit on the small side.  The pastry was a perfect golden brown and flaky.  This is a very hearty entree and there was a good amount of tender steak, 'shrooms and root veggies.  I am just not sure the quality makes up for the lack of quantity when you consider the price tag ($24.00).  \n\nFor dessert, we selected the Potted Chocolate Triffle ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=4KSMWCaEumIG2DXwpsqF9A ) which came with two mini chocolate chocolate chip cookies.\n\nRohlinism:  It isn't Thanksgiving dinner without a fattening dessert!\n\nLaina was basically full, but always manages to find extra room for chocolaty delicious desserts.  The triffle was topped with white chocolate shavings and round dark chocolate crisps.  The mixture of dark and milk chocolate was fantastic and the Chantilly cream put this dessert on another level!  Fantastic way to end the meal!\n\nService was really good for the most part.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were sat promptly at 7:00 pm (love that British punctuality).  Our server was efficient and answered all our questions (or asked someone who knew), but he could have benefited from a personality transplant.\n\nIt is a bit on the expensive side, but that is to be expected and you can get $1.00 off most items by joining Total Rewards.  Overall, I was impressed enough with the food to return in the future."

So loud in fact that sitting at a table I had to literally yell for people at the same table to hear me. The fact this place sits in a casino makes it bad, but then if you add the tv's playing sports at maximum volume it makes it even worse. \n\nThe food is just okay. I have been to other Ramsay restaurants and they were by far better than this. Although it is not horrible it should be noted. I would suggest that anyone that comes here to eat some of the more British style food like shepherds pie or fish and chips. After all it is a British chefs menu and would you go to a Mexican restaurant and have spaghetti?"

My husband and I both love watching all of Gordon Ramsay's shows so when we stumbled across his Pub and Grill at Caesar's Palace, we knew we had to give it a try. The hostess sat us in a lovely cozy booth and the ambiance was on point. Our server was David S. Gordon Ramsay is very lucky to have such an amazing and talented server such as David, working for him. My husband and I come from the restaurant industry and so we know the importance of good service and David is what all servers should strive to be. He was welcoming and professional and extremely knowledgeable. He showed us his picture of him with Gordon because my husband and I were very curious about the \"real\" Ramsay compared to what you see on television on HK. David had nothing but raving reviews about Gordon. Next we looked over the menu and couldn't decide what to order since it all looked so good. We decided to try the happy hour menu so that we could taste multiple items. Excellent prices as well! We ordered the kettle chip nachos, wings, truffle fries, and burger.  Everything we ordered was exactly what you'd expect to get from Gordon Ramsay. The nachos were to die for. Kettle chips and tender meats with the most velvety cheese sauce was like an explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth. The truffle fries come with the most addicting dipping sauce. Garlic fries don't stand a chance to these fries! My husband loves wings but I do not, that was until I tried these. WOW!!!! Just goes to prove that quality of food is truly key to successful dishes. We wanted happy hour cocktails but didn't know what to order so David recommend the Goodbye Blue Sky and The Pub Crawl. Perfectly pairs with our dishes. To make this experience even more fabulous and memorable, David presented us with it only one, but two, amazing desserts to help us celebrate our honeymoon. This was the first and only time during our stay in Vegas that we truly felt special regarding our honeymoon! We asked David about other spectacular activities to do while in Vegas and he had many suggestions. Everything we asked him about the food we ate and the restaurant, David had a very insightful response/answer. Mr. Ramsay, your server David is a delight and treasure to your restaurant. We will be back yearly and although David may not still be there, we will eat there every time! Thank you!"

I've learned not to always judge a book by its cover so I still decided to give this place a try. \n\nWe went to dinner on a Sunday evening. Made reservations around 7:45p and this place was pretty busy.  My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio Pesto Chicken Sandwich-it's a cold sandwich by the way. Also ordered truffle fries. He enjoyed it. I had a bite and it was pretty good. \n\nHowever.....I ordered an 8 oz burger, the waiter asked if I wanted cheese...I declined. But when the burger arrived....the burger was just a plain bun and the meat. I was thinking...okay...that's odd. Maybe these fancy-smancy restaurants make their burgers like that. It was plain and boring. Yes...I get it. I ordered a \"boring dish.\" But sometimes, a good restaurant can turn the most simple dish into something that will tickle your tastebuds and leave you wanting more. \nWe decide to ask the waiter what happened to the condiments. Where's the lettuce...tomatoes...onions...etc? He told us we were supposed to order that if we wanted it. -__- ugh. Thanks for your help, waiter. You were such a helpful guy. *insert sarcastic tone here.* So remember..FYI...IF you ever order the burger here, make sure to ask for veggies!!!!! What kind of restaurant don't automatically give you the lettuce to your burger? It's like ordering a chicken pot pie without the chicken. \n\nAlso, the price for what we paid was NOT worth the quality of the food. $17 for the pesto chicken sandwich and $18 for a plain ol tasteless hamburger. Disappointing. I'm never coming back here."

I grew up in the U.K on fish and chips so I've had a few in my lifetime. The beer battered cod was everything you'd expect. I'm taking off a 1/2 point as you never get shoestring chips in England. The fries were a bit of a disappointment. I'm adding a half point on how well they did the peas. First you have to like peas and then again you need to like mint as it's seems to me a combo dish. Personally loved it. Wife had the butternut squash soup and practically licked the bowl. Bartender service outstanding. Will be back next visit."

            "review": "Given the restaurant is by the snooty ass Gordon Ramsey, I expected more.  However, I only intended to drink to occupy myself while my out-of-town were gambling.  Somewhat disappoint that the sparkling wine listed on the menu was not the one they were pouring...it was Chateau Ste. Michele, which is a good value but only about $8.00 at CVS and naturally it was $8.00 a glass here.  However, the bartender was cool and topped me off a few times free of charge, but I did order 3 glasses...I would have been smarter buying the bottle from the beginning.  Like I said I don't gamble, and expected my guest to turn up definitely by the time I was on drink #2...sadly they showed up when I completed glass #3 and was about to order #4...however, thankfully, husband intervened and comforted me that we have several bottle of this in our \"everyday\" wine stock.  So I stopped and like the intelligent person I am said let's order FOOD! to complete the evaluation of this place. I was only thinking of my fellow yelpers, YKWIM?\n\nSo all 4 of us shared sliders and fish and chips.  All of it was Ok, but given that Ramsey is such a hardass, I expected more so much more!  The food did not deliver, but still it was decent.  Fresh, but just ordinary.\n\nif I come back, it is only to sit at the bar and have drinks.\n \nPS.  Whoever won Hell's kitchen needs atleast a few more lessons.  Also the outfits of the wait staff are hideous."

The wing sauce was too tomatoey for us and didn't have the heat we were expecting. The salad and soup were alright but nothing amazing. \n\nOverall the food was good as was the service and the overall decor but it seemed overpriced for what it was. I would recommend going to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr place across the street at Planet Hollywood I think it is way better than the Pub and Grill."

            "review": "Gordon Ramsay is a name that has branded itself as funky, unique and a good quality dining experience, and that is exactly what you will get at the Pub & Grill! Located conveniently at Caesars Palace, it opened about three years ago with now head chef Scott Commings from Hell's Kitchen!\n\nWhen I first walked in, I was greeted by a friendly hostess and noticed the unique uniform that the staff wears. I love how they dress the part and really makes the dining experience even more unique. I came here on a Saturday for lunch where there was futbol (soccer) game showing so the\nrestaurant was live and packed! The ambiance felt so warm and welcoming and the d\u00e9cor inside the restaurant was modern and very classy. Of course, I didn't except anything less for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant inside Caesars Palace!\n\nI ate here for lunch and picking my meal was hard when I wanted to try everything! Carrie and Sara were our waitress and they were so friendly and accommodating to me and my friend. They told us about the restaurant, a little bit of the background and many things about the menu. Just talking to them for the first few minutes, I knew they were knowledgeable and trustworthy of their suggestions.\n\nFirst, the drinks! They have an array of beers, wines, and cocktails! They have a full bar and use fresh ingredients to make your drinks. I tried the very popular cocktail suggested by Carrie called \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" and I must say... best drink ever! It is so refreshing for a hot summer day. I believe it is a blueberry vodka drink with muddled fresh berries and a splash of sparkling wine! For an appetizer, I tried the calamari with bacon bits. Wow! It is out of the ordinary. The calamari was crunchy and packed with flavor, especially with the bacon added to it and they make their own tartar sauce! For my main course, I tried the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. The portions are huge! My sandwich came with a very thick and toasted sandwich packed with chicken and mouth-watering pesto! The fries were crunchy and simple to compliment all the flavors inside the sandwich! Lunch was delicious and I wish I had enough room for dessert. I have been hearing from word of mouth, yelp and the staff that the sticky toffee pudding is a must-try! I will definitely try it next time I dine!\n\nOverall, the experience was amazing. Everything from food to service was impeccable. Carrie and Sara were amazing! I had mentioned that my friend and I were fans of Hell's Kitchen so Chef Scott came out and introduced himself! It was a very friendly and unexpected gesture that made my dining experience even better! I will definitely be back again!"

The Flank steak was one of the top steaks ever ordered in a restaurant, so tender and perfect. Loved the cocktails. The Sheppard's Pie looked smaller than it was - very filling, even for two, if you get another plate too.  It's shredded beef and was so tender. We couldn't finish it all.  The onion soup was great - a little sweeter and less salty than the french version.  My husband wanted to add salt, but there's none of that on the table. Without reservations, we'd have waited a while. It's only steps away from the concert venue, Elton John, so perfect place for dinner if you plan to see that show. The service was good - four or five hostesses to greet you - which one do I choose. The bartender was swamped, so took a while for drinks.  The manager came by several times and walked the restaurant a lot.  The guy who dropped off our food asked if we would be sharing and offered to bring sharing plates.  I loved the initiative of that. We never had to wait for plates to be cleared - they were picked up right away.  Definitely allow 2 hours for your dining experience.  It's not a fast-food restaurant.  This is a place to come and savor your meal, the company, and the ambiance.  Nothing is rushed, which I loved.  The table was never crowded and plates weren't coming out on top of each other.  The entire staff was pleasant and enjoyable - contrary to the punk get-up.  \n\nI read the reviews prior to coming and almost went somewhere else.  Geez, you guys are hard to please.  I LOVED my experience!  it was pricey, but the special occassion warranted the splurge.  And it's Vegas.  You expect that there.  Glad I decided to take a risk and find out for myself.  I hope others can take these reviews with a grain of salt too.  My only regret was that we were too full for dessert.   Oh, also regret not ordering the deviled eggs at the bar while we waited for our reservation.  Certain menu items in the bar are not available at the table.   Will definitely go back!\n\nSuggestion:  If you plan to have a full dinner, make reservations and request a booth or a high table.  A lot of the tables are low, better for drinks and appetizers, but not a meal.  And also request the back of the restaurant.  I also didn't like the fishbowl effect of the front of the restaurant.  Once you're well inside the restaurant, you feel more cozy and intimate."

We read menu.... pork, veal, lamb, pork, pork ... duck. No burger. Waiter 2 comes by and we ask about burger and part of lunch menu. We can order but will take 30 minutes or more to get them since prep staff not present. 2 of 4 of us order burgers, 1 gets hanger steak and 1 gets fish and chips. We have empty drinks and not asked about refills. Ordered drinks with waiter 1 and drinks no show. Order drinks with waiter 2 and get 10 minutes later. When waiter 2 returns with the burgers but no hanger steak or fish and chips. Then drinks arrive from waiter 2, as we watched our drinks from waiter 1 sit on the bar for 30 minutes. Waiter 1 starts to deliver our drinks 5 minutes later and does an about face before arriving at our table when he sees the drinks on the table. But no one asks the other guys in our party if they want refills. I started this review on my Smart Phone which I had for a week and wasn't used to typing on it and now I am finishing it up a month and half later. But the upshot was it was one of the most unusual and memorable (not in a good way) dining experiences I ever had. I thought of filling out a card for management as I left, but I couldn't find one. I asked the hostess and she looked at me like I had 3 heads and a tail."

Our waiter also was interrupted three times while trying to go over our questions on the menu by other patrons as if we weren't even there, which is also another star off.  I could go down to two stars, but it wasn't awful food, but it wasn't spectacular either.   It's a high priced Pub, and with a star chef's name attached, I expected better.  I have been to Ramsay's Burgr place and that's a four star burger, but this was just meh.  Soups and salads all serviceable.  If you are in an English Pub, have to try one of the mainstays, so I went with the Fish and Chips.  You get two very large pieces of fish and plenty of chips, but a tiny little tin of tartar sauce (had to ask for more and that seemed to be a chore for the waiter).  Decor is fun and a lot to look at, but highly bothered by the service and location we got.  Not likely going back to this place."

I had a beer that cost $9.00 which was a bit much, but the food prices are what you should expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.\n\nTip: make sure to make reservations & if you have a rewards card you can get a discount.\n\nMenu tip: they have a bar menu & a dinner menu. So make sure to ask for both. If you sit at the bar you can only order from the bar menu.\n\nFood recommendation: I highly recommend the Mac & cheese. It's like no other you have ever had. It is topped with truffles. It is a good portion so you can share with another person or take the other half home. \nIf your not a fan of steak fries then I don't recommend the pub chips since they are twice the thickness of steak fries, my husband is very picky and did not like them, but I thought they were yummy."

I had both dishes before, and they didn't disappoint.  One guy proclaimed the sliders the best burger he had eaten.  They are perfect in composition and execution, you get every ingredient in every bite.  They are consistent as well.  Our table ordered a second helping....\n\nTo eat, I had fish and chips and part of the short rib/beef cheek sandwich.  The sandwich was legit, had a little spice to it, and the meats were very tender.  Likewise, the fish and chips were fantastic, although the fries are a little thick for my taste.  I realize this is classic for this dish, I just prefer skinnier fries.  The fish and chips may seem expensive at around $26, but you get a LOT of food.  Very large pieces of fish, and the breading can stand up to vinegar or the homemade tartar sauce.  Both entrees are definite repeats.\n\nFor dessert, I recommended the sticky toffee pudding.  This is the 2nd time I've had it (we ordered 2 servings, like with the sliders), and I still say it may be the best dessert I've eaten.  We had people eating the caramel sauce out of the small pitcher it comes in.  This dessert is moist, yet a little crunchy.  The ice cream and sauce complement it very well.  A must order.\n\nGood beer selection, and knowledgeable servers.  This is an excellent place to get a casual bite while at Caesars."

Then so did the pretzels which we had lost interest in. 3 tiny sticks for $8 with sickly liquid cheddar and mustard so hot to one's senses it was inedible. And I love hot.\nThe steak was vastly under seasoned. The scallops had a nice sear on them (4 for $32, yipes!)  but the chowder they were on was cold. Terrible thing to serve a chowder cold. The taste was there though. Too much $ for these plates.\nWe had to ask for a steak knife, spoon for the chowder, salt and pepper.

Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us, when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately, but that was the high point of the evening.\n\nWe ordered fish & chips and prime rib, both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold, my fries were cold and greasy, my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server, he said that the fish & chips were made \"only\" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes, I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?\n\nBesides that, the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table, which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt, a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking, but the servers clearly do not have the same \"vision\".\n\nWhen we complained to the manager, he was dismissive and condescending, making sure to inform us that \"Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great\".  Well maybe great when the boss is around, but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.\n\nBottom Line: Save your money for fish fries at your local Catholic church during Lent.  Gordon's made enough money from hard-working \"no counts\" like us."

I'd say go for drinks and dessert, skip the dinner, especially for the price!  \n\nI've now been to all 3 of Ramsay's Vegas establishments and would recommend Steak and Burgr hands down above this one.  I'm surprised they hail it as Gordon's hang out when he's in Vegas, because we found it.. well.. disappointing."

It is situated in the Forum Casino right next to Caesar's food court, so it is on the way to the Forum Shops. \n\nThe look and feel of the place is a hip, upscale pub.  There is a a big bar, tons of tables and then some booths too.  It is a really big space and it is lined with lots of big TVs if you want to watch a game (they had soccer on while we were there).  All the waitresses are in newsprint and safety pin dresses and the waiters are in skinny black jeans and spiked suspenders.  It is modern hip punk....whatever!  I liked it all, it worked.  \n\nWe basically ordered burgers and beer.  Their drinks menu is on an ipad that they bring over and let you flip through so you can see pretty pictures of whatever you want to order.  Drinks are Vegas prices (so high).  Our Sam Adams was like $9.  The burgers came out and they were thick and well cooked.  The fries that come with it, as many have commented, are different.  They are a very, very think cut steak fry.  It is almost like they quarter a potato and deep fry it (to give you a visual on how thick they were).  I loved both my burger and my fries.  The burger had great flavor & it was juicy. The fries were fully cooked and had a bit of crust, but were a little more mushy in the middle.  They had a great flavor though and I loved the different take on a classic.  \n\nOur server was terrific and he let us linger.  It was a good experience.  It was Vegas pricey, but we were in the resort so you just kind of expect that!"

The high prices didn't bother us and the food choices were different. I had the lobster mac-n-cheese and my fiance had the shepherd's pie.. well my mac-n-cheese was very mediocre it was a bland gritty cheese sauce (I can make a better sauce at home) and the few pieces of lobster sitting on top tasted like they have been sitting in an ice tub in the fridge. Come on Gordon I know you can do better. Infuse the cheese sauce with lobster or something.. $24 for a cup of cafeteria mac-n-cheese with some defrosted lobster bits on top.. Now for the shepherd's pie. My fiance got violently ill the next day! FOOD POISONING! Never in all the years that we have vacationed anywhere (several times in vegas) has anything like this happened. The day we were suppose to leave to go home and he can't stop.... we'll you know no need to be graphic. He was so bad that we had to stay an extra night in vegas cause he couldn't be in a moving car. An extra night in vegas is not great when you are taking care of a very ill person. Needless to say we will never ever come back to this location and probably never go to another Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Next time we are sticking to Craftsteak (Tom Colicchio's place) now they know how to cook lobster."

We gave the waitress our cell phone number and she said she would text us once our table was ready... 50 minutes later, we were seated at our table.  The hostess was rude - hardly looked me in the eye, never smiled, and was completely miserable.  - I'm sure Gordon Ramsey would have thrown a few F-bombs. \n\nMy four stars is given to the Traditional Shepard's Pie.  Ohhh baby, it's GOOD.  It's a smaller portion, but don't let that fool you.  This rich, juicy, and savory dish will leave you more than satisfied.  You can tell that the beef in this dish had been marinating in the stock all day.  Needless to say, I ate the entire thing.  \n\nYou get a little bread basket before your meal that consists of pretzels and a caraway seed roll.  Salted butter and melted cheese are served next to the breads for dipping.  \n\nMy guest had the fish and chips, which were excellent too.  The \"chips\" were my favorite.  They are large, one inch potato sticks seasoned with parmesan cheese and salt - fried perfectly.  If you get another dish without chips, I recommend getting a side of these to try, you can't find them cooked like this anywhere else. \n\nThe dinner was pricey.  Our bill (two entrees and one soda), was $50.00.  This isn't your 'visit-every-week' pub, but it's definitely worth going to - whether a local or a tourist.  I would say, it might be one of the more unique restaurants on the strip, food wise.  \n\nBUT, like I stated before, service needs to be improved.  The hostess made me feel as though she didn't want my business, and I didn't feel very welcomed.  Once I sat down, our waiter was nice, but the hostess ruined the initial experience."

(Put them side by side and you can easily tell by the topping that it's not).\n\n3-4 minutes later i get a new burger with proper topping and bacon.\nCut it in half and notice it's quite pink but i did order medium instead of medium well as i figured the meat at a Gordon Ramsay should be top quality.\n\nAfter a couple of bites, someone else comes to deliver my burger...yes, they sent two out !\n\nSo i eat half and only a couple of bites on the outside are good, the rest was too raw for me.\nWhen i look into the second half of the burger you can clearly see it's very raw.\n\nShow the waitress and she says she will talk to the manager.\nA couple of minutes later i see him coming towards me but he walks by.\nA minute or two later he comes over and says he went to the wrong table and started saying sorry to them about the burger, they said it was great why are you sorry ?\n\nSo he starts his i'm sorry speech and says it's on him. And asks that i try them again the next time i'm in town...right, with all the restaurants in a one mile radius, why would i bother taking the long trek into the abyss of Cesar's Palace for that ?\n\nWhat a complete useless bunch ! I left a tip for the waitress, but now regret doing so, she doesn't know the difference in looks between the two meat burgers they serve ?!?\n\nGordon would have been livid if he actually worked there and not just sell his name.\nShame, i rather like Gordon and his devotion to food.\n\nNow lets hope i won't get sick from the raw meat.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and eat elsewhere."

The signature scallop dish recommended by our server was small and below Red Lobster quality (think Shoney's or something along those lines), the chicken pot pie tasted like a frozen meat pie.  No joke, it was really lousy and the loud mouth celebrity chef should be ashamed to have his name attached to it.  It's a restaurant worthy of a reality show and perhaps that's the point because I can't think of a better reason to open a new restaurant in the middle of a busy casino that is so awful and completely overpriced for the poor quality food served up.  Service was equally uninspired, the girl that brought our dishes to us was flat out frightening and surly, our main server seemed completely out of it as well.  Overall we felt completely unsatisfied with our meals and ripped off even by Vegas pricing standards.  Yuck! Totally disappointing considering we'd had a great meal at Ramsay's BurGR two days earlier.  I understand that The Pub was supposed to be Gordon's outlet for serving up his own favourites so I can only assume he's acquired a taste for the fare he samples when he arrives on set at Kitchen Nightmares. It's that bad.  The decor was cool but.. that's the only thing thing this place has going for it... period."

What she didn't realize was I had already been drinking those types of beers for many hours that day, but it was late and I was winding down with a Miller Lite. I ordered the Shepard's Pie and Mac & Cheese. Both were delicious. No doubt the best Shepard's Pie and Mac & Cheese I've ever had. \nA few days later a I took a couple friends back, and we sat in the dining room. The place wasn't that crowded, but the whole night our waitress kept disappearing, and leaving us hanging. She even apologized on one occasion for being gone for so long. It was actually kind of weird. One of the people I was with asked her what she recommended to eat, and she said everybody loves the fish & chips. When she walked away I told both of my friends how good the shepard's pie and mac & cheese were. My one buddy and myself ordered the fish & chips, and my buddy's wife ordered the shepard's pie. My buddy's wife loved the shepard's pie, but $28.00 for the fish & chips my buddy and myself weren't impressed. When you cut into a piece of fish you expect to see nice flaky fish. This fish wasn't flaky, and it was too greasy. My buddy also ordered the Butternut Squash Soup which he said was delicious."

You really have to be a hardcore meat eater to enjoy items listed on the menu. Sure, they will modify whatever they can to make it vegetarian friendly, but the best option you really have is well, the beer.\nWe walked in for lunch and the seating hostess seated us at the farthest table possible, which was closest to the kitchen. That just seemed very odd when there was a plethora of empty pub tables and tables with comfy chairs on the walk over. I asked that we be seated elsewhere because I did not want to smell of food. She made a face, but f*ck that. When I fork money on the food at a restaurant (and I am not cheap by any means), I expect to be seated where I deem I would be most comfortable.\nOnce we were seated and handed our menus, the server came by almost instantly. He made recommendations on beers, but given that most beers lately are on the hoppiest side with the IPAs and such, barring your quintessential Coors, Stella, my only option was Boddingtons. Which wasn't bad (more like an amber ale), but come on, I can buy these at the store. My husband opted for a combination of Guiness and Stella, which he rather liked.\nWe also ended up ordering an order of the Warm Salty pretzels and the mini pub sliders (minus the bacon). Here is where food math fails me - there's 2 of us, but there are 3 pretzel sticks in the order. Am I supposed to break one in half to share it 50-50 with my husband!? That said, they were soft and the mustard that came with was great! We requested that the meat be well done on our burgers, but they were medium at best. Flavorful, nonetheless. The order was fulfilling. But nothing spectacular. Our server was great. But this will probably be the only time I visit here."

And the sides: the asparagus was so overcooked it was actually mushy and there were just a few tiny potatoes. The salmon came with lentils and was SO SO SO bland. Like SO bland.

At 9:45, I was ready to leave, but low and behold, our waiter reappears with our food.  My wife and I both ordered the Mix Fillet, with Yukon gold potatoes and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms as the sides.  Well, the steak was lukewarm, the pork was room temperature, and the mushrooms were room temperature and the egg on top was not fully cooked.  But the potatoes were good and so were the two shrimp that come with the mixed fillet.  My wife and I were both ticked, asked a bus boy and another waitress to see the manger, who shows up 10 minutes later.  Mark the manager offers us a free desert, which we decline and I ask for the bill, letting him know this was the worst dining experience we have had in Las Vegas and will be telling all of our guest, friends, family, and coworkers about it.  He offers to comp us a dinner and asks if we want to make that reservation now.  We flatly say no; I don't want to waste another attempt at a meal at this place given all the great places to eat in Las Vegas.  We finally left at 10:00 and when we rolled into the hotel we had some fruit and ice cream which were more satisfying."

Unfortunately our entire group left disappointed on all 3 points. Here is where they failed....\n- seated late for our reservation (large group of 16)\n- staff could have been friendlier \n- The washrooms were gross (a reflection on what the kitchen looks like?)\n- the food was mediocre, disappointed and expected better!\n- one burger order came out raw\n- the waiter got the order wrong then tried to place blame on the 2 people which ordered\n- they had to wait 25 mins for the right order while the rest of us ate our food. The food came once everyone else was done eating.(was told it would be 7 mins)\n- was told bills could not be separated...they had to do a minimum of 4 cheques- despite our telling 3 servers how to separate the 4 bills at the start of our meal it didn't happen. We had to wait for an additional 30 mins for the bill to be separated...we also had to calculate taxes and gratuity ourselves. \n- the entire experience was a 3 hour ordeal which is much too long when u want to get out and experience Vegas!! \n\nThe good points...\n- sticky toffee pudding!! \n- truffle fries"

            "review": "So the winner of season 11 of Hell's Kitchen will be the head chef of this restaurant. Perhaps that is why the restaurant seems to have hit or miss reviews right now. The show finished filming awhile ago so the new head chef has already been chosen, but they can't be seen at the restaurant since that would give away the ending of the show. Having an absentee head chef certainly can't be helping. Even though overall I had a good dining experience, the restaurant was not without its rough edges.\n\nWe showed up around 9pm without reservations, but were able to get seated on the restaurant side almost immediately. They put our party of 5 at a table for 4. There were plenty of other tables, but we were told they had all been reserved. Of course they remained empty the rest of the night (we were there until closing) despite a post show rush right after we arrived. This was annoying, but pretty common for Las Vegas as almost no one charges a reservation no show fee.\n\nOur server was pretty awesome. He was funny and really knew the food. Pretty much everyone working there was great from the hostess to the runners. The one big exception was one particularly sour runner. When she brought our starters I told her I did not have a fork and she snapped \"well, then I'll bring you one\" at me. She then brought me 3 forks and four knives. I shrugged this off as maybe a poorly executed attempt at humor. Later on, one of our party asked her for more bread, a fairly common request at a restaurant and one that other reviewers made with no difficulties, but she reacted with shock and began to tell us that wasn't allowed. Before she could finish, she cut herself off and said she would let the server know. Maybe she did, but I doubt it since we just saw her go off to the back while our server was elsewhere in the restaurant helping put some smaller tables together for a big group since heaven forbid they actually seat someone at one of the reserved tables that obviously weren't coming. When they brought out our entrees, she didn't bring mine and asked me what I ordered. After I told her she went to get it and plooped it down in front of me before walking away without a word. I guess that's what I get for asking for a fork.\n\nThe food was excellent all around, although the menu seemed too small. We later found out that the menu was once nearly twice the size, but they trimmed it down to just the most popular items. In my humble opinion, they went a bit too far with the trimming. The small plates (appetizers) menu now only has 5 choices and 3 of them are cold seafood items. There were 5 seafood items and 8 meat items (actually 7 since the beef cheeks were not available the evening we dined). There may or may not have been an entree sized salad since the menu did not differentiate them. The most expensive salad was only $4 more than the salad I had as a starter so I don't think it was entree size.\n\nFor starters I had the Herb Caesar Salad. The server warned that it came with \"a lot\" of anchovies which I was OK with, but it turns out it just came with one small anchovy. It was a good, if not particularly memorable salad. Another member of our party ordered the smashed potatoes and sauteed asparagus as her starters. They are technically sides, but none of the other starters interested her so she ordered them as starters. I thought the potatoes were good, but the asparagus was just OK for me. Another member of our party ordered the Pub \"Spots\" which are described as sliders on the menu, but the name \"Spots\" is a better description. They were very good, but also very small. You could finish the whole plate in 3 bites. We also had two members of our party order soups which they said were delicious, but I didn't get a chance to try.\n\nFor entrees, my friend and I each had a shepherd's pie. Since we were both quite hungry we were a little disappointed at how small it looked, but looks can be deceiving. The little pot they are served in is quite deep and there is a decent amount of food in there. I ended up completely satisfied and can say that this was the best shepherd's pie I have ever had. I also got to try the Scottish Salmon, rib eye steak, and the rack of lamb. All three were delicious. The rack of lamb in particular stood out because I love lamb, but am weary about ordering it in restaurants because often the portions are on the small side. The lamb here is a very hearty portion. Of course for dessert I had to try the sticky toffee. It was delicious. I can see why it is Gordon Ramsay's signature dessert. My friend ordered the chocolate trifle. We shared both desserts with the whole table and while the trifle was OK, the sticky toffee disappeared far quicker.\n\nSo overall I had a great experience except for the one bitter food runner. I could see myself coming back, but unless they expand that menu a bit I don't think I would come that often."

We all decided to order the fish and chips, but there was little consistency between the three plates.  Both of my co-workers received three pieces of fish, that were barely deep fried.  The batter was very soggy with no crisp or crunch you expect with an order of fish and chips. One of the dishes came out missing the lemon wedge and tartar sauce, which was quickly brought upon request.  While mine were cooked longer and actually tasted good, I only received two pieces instead of three.  The 'chips' tasted very much like Burger King's fries, something you don't expect when paying this price.  A friendly waiter could have made this experience better, but ours wasn't very personable.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, especially with so many other options in Las Vegas."

We arrived around 7pm, were seated immediately without reservations, and were well-monitored by relatively friendly staff. We both got the fish and chips with some drinks. There were four huge fillets of fish and plenty of chips (fries), and everything tasted great. No disappointments! We should have split the dish (and I wish our server had warned us of the portions but it was our responsibility to ask). The beer and my cocktail were good (I got the mocha martini) but both arrived at the end of the meal, which was annoying . However, our server apologized for the wait, explaining that the bar was backed up. I liked the decor of the place, the servers' and host/hostess's uniforms were really cool classic British punk themed.\n\nMy only significant complaint is regarding the few tables behind the host/hostess counter. The table was very high compared to the low-resting chairs and made for an uncomfortable dining position. The table was also a bit wide and it was difficult to have a more intimate evening when we were seated so far apart and had to have a shouting match over the casino music.\n\nWe may be back again but I want to check out Ramsay's other establishments."

            "review": "The name/image of \"Gordon Ramsey\" is super hot right now, so of course there was an allure to try out this new restaurant.  It's located in Caesar's Palace, near the Forum shops entrance.  This is the location where the winner of the current Hell's Kitchen will be awarded the Executive Chef position.  Making reservations didn't seem necessary as the restaurant wasn't very full.  In fact, I was a little disappointed in our table selection considering we took the extra time to make reservations and plan weeks in advance of our LV trip (we were put in a middle isle table away from the outside view or more intimate, private booth areas).\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was incredible.  The theme of an English Pub was evident in every detail, including the staffs' attire.  The color coordinated Doc Martens were awesome!  We absolutely LOVED the music (throw back memories of high school), which included The Smiths, The Cure, and other great Brit hits.\n\nThe menu offered standard English pub food.  The drink menu wasn't very expansive.  We opted to start out with the fried oysters as an appetizer with the Mothers Ruin and Ramsey's Tonic for drinks.  The appetizer was executed and delivered perfectly.  The drinks were ok, nothing spectacular compared to other places on the Strip.\n\nOne of my fav parts of our dining experience was the bread plate they bring to your table.  It was phenomenal and I wanted like 5 more!  It includes 3 different flavored pretzel sticks and nut loaf.  My fav was the herb pretzel!  It had 2 dipping options: butter and a cheddar/horseradish (which had just the right amount of \"kick\").\n\nFor our main course we got the Shepard's Pie and the Fish 'n Chips.  I really don't care for lamb and its flavor seemed to take over the whole dish.  The Fish 'n Chips were superb.  All the food was piping hot and seasoned perfectly.  \n\nWe ended the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  Honestly, we were so full that we left half the dessert, which was a shame considering it was so good!  The caramelized top was the best part!  It wasn't too sweet and had a nice balance with the sweet cream ice cream. Definitely worth a try!\n\nThe only reason I didn't give my experience 5 stars is because of the service.  I was disappointed that for the cost of the meal and quite honestly because it is attached to Chef Ramsey's name, the service wasn't more professional.  I took offense to the young hostess calling me \"sweetie\".  Her interactions came off as condescending and indifferent... she never greeted us until a manager came up.  And considering I am at least 2 decades older than her, it was rude.  Our waiter wasn't attentive, in fact he refilled our water AFTER we asked for the check.  We also had to ask for appetizer plates and utensils/napkins twice, while the appetizer grew cold.  While fine dining is meant to be savored and time is not of the essence...the 20 minutes it took to just get our check and pay wasn't necessary and was wasted moments of my life.   \n\nIf only Chef Ramsey had been around....our dining excursion would have been heavenly.....  I mean who doesn't like Hell's Kitchen?!?  :)"

I am unable to forget our pleasant experience . During the mid afternoon of August 17, my husband and I stopped in for appetizers and a few cocktail before going, later that evening to Ruth Chris's for dinner. We were celebrating for our 19th wedding anniversary .\n After enjoying appetizers and cocktail, our waitress, while carrying a tray with full  dirty dishes, leftover food & drinks, accidentally spilled the tray and all of its contents on me. My blouse and my purse were soaked and the pain of the dishes falling on me was  excruciating . The waitress was true professional , concern about me and most apologetic. Her manager was another story, it took him nearly 10 min. to come check on my husband and me. He never apologized, he never offered  to pay to have  my blouse cleaned, and instead of writing off our entire bill he simply paid for our cocktail . I was humiliate and embarrassed.\nVery awful & unprofessional manager !!!"

I had the scallops. The dish lacked taste and creativity. One of my friends had  over cooked lamb and the other the sliders. I have to say the sliders were the best thing we ordered on the table. I would go back for an appy and a beer but would steer clear of the main dishes."

She was very attentive, answered all questions, had a great sense of humor & smile :) She was busy and dealt with some not so nice customers but never stopped smiling or keeping up with her nice customers :)\n\nHighly recommend .... and ask for Jenny! :)"

            "review": "I normally write separate reviews for each visit but these visits are only days apart. \n\nVISIT #1\nI came with some Yelperazzis for a snack before a Yelp event ( yes, we ate before a food sampling event and we went to eat after that too). We just decided to share some bits at the recommendation of David who has tried a extensive bit of the menu. \n\nThe short rib and beef cheek sandwich was the star for me. It was beautifully braised and tender and I love their housemade stone ground mustard with a horseradish kick.\n\n I hate when a place can make a Shepherds pie that puts mine to shame (and I know mine is fucking delicious) but this did me in. I like that its a combo of lamb and beef and the gravy of it was savory and worth sopping up if there's some left after devouring (save a piece of bread or ask for some!). \n\nThe deviled eggs were good in that the bacon does add a kick to it, but to me a deviled egg is just alright. \n\nPei mussels and clams were perfectly cooked and the broth with it was solid and had a nice saffron flavor.\n\nI got the Magic Hat #9 to drink which was nice and freshly apricot to cut the richness of the food. \n\nService was on point. Lovely, funny, enthusiastic Elise took such great care of us, filled our drinks, checked in on us, gave great recommendations and got us checked out in a flash.  \n\nVISIT #2\n\nA few days later I return for my BFs friends birthday with a large party of 10 people. It was much busier on a Saturday night than the weekday we came. \n\nThe BF and I got the duck confit poutine to start as I really wanted it when I came last but they were out. I say it's rather good and comforting, lots of shredded confit to go around for each bite of fries. I don't know if I would call it poutine as I normally have a much thicker gravy, but this au jus gravy situation was densely rich. We tried bites of our friends scotch egg which was a great version of a dish I am a big fan of. One friend got some pub spot sliders which was okay but a bit too well done for my taste. \n\nThe BF got fish and chips which I thought was a solidly done one. I definitely am a fan of their tartar sauce! They don't give you malt vinegar automatically but ask if you want it. They have this garlic aioli that came with someones order but I asked for more to dip the steak fries in. If you love aioli on potatoes like I do, it'll elevate your fries. \n\nI got the Irish beef cheek stew and fuck me sideways it was so tender and perfect. I did need some more potato but people kept throwing me their log fries so I mashed that into the jus and aaahhh, noms. Clean plate of course. Between this, the short rib and cheek sandwich this place knows how to braise meat to meltingly tender. \n\nI had to get some sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious. It's one of my all time favorite comforts and theirs was definitely everything this is supposed to be. People wanted to taste and inside in my head was screaming \"no, no, no\" while I shared nicely like my mommy taught me. \n\nEveryone was happy with their food. One of our friends orders wasn't put in... It worked out since there was no way another friend could finish their sandwich so they shared and they expedited a duck confit poutine for him. \n\nService was decent enough from our server and another server helping our table with water a few times. The person who white knighted the service though was our busser David that helped get all our random sauces and got to some ignored sodas and waters a few times.\n\n The thing that really blew chunks was we were held hostage for the bill. People shoulda spoke up to maybe split before things were even ordered so that part was our fault, but the way it was split was so inefficient. Went to one person and asked what they ordered and then disappeared and going one by one and coming back to recheck and check again and again which is which. He came to ask us what we had twice after the first time. \n\nSplit checks during my first visit was painless. She tabbed which person is whose on one big check then came with one check back that split it into seat #1, #2, #3, etc. to make sure it was right then paired the card/cash to the seat and came back with our individual receipts - done. This took forever this time when I really think it shouldn't have been that hard to get items to the right person. A little wait was expected, but we waited almost as long for checks than our entire meal duration. One friend was salty they got attitude from the server about the bill? I did not witness or asked for a elaboration. Apparently this place also runs with having a cashier settle bills for the servers and they only have one? This place is packed so I think they may need another if a lot of people are waiting. \n\nPleased with the food and my first visit but coming with a smaller party at non peak hours to sit in Elises section! I'll average it to a 4stars as \"I'm a fan\", but warn big parties to handle splitting yourself and don't come when busy!\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 13/100)"

Their tone, demeanor, and body language reflected on how much they really didn't liked working there.  There seemed to be no management or supervision at all.  I really don't want disgruntled employees handling my food.  Lots of good people looking for jobs out there...\n\nFood:  I ordered the fish and chips (20+$$$)  2 bites is all it took to realize that this tasted like long john silvers's fast food garbage.  It had no seasoning but it didn't lack the oil it was swamped in...very foul!!  The \"chips\" were thick rectangular potato wedges that tasted fine but nothing special.  Our waitress didn't seem to care and was not surprised at all, Hmmmm...makes ya wonder.  She seemed to care more about taking the plates away immediately as though my friend and I came there to scam them out of lunch. My friend ordered a rare and expensive beer that was supposed to be served in a special glass, but that didn't happen.  I wonder if they serve wine in shot glasses...after this experience it would not phase me one bit.\n\nThis place is a tourist trap using Gordon Ramsay's name and prices but clearly not his standards/quality.  The staff's \"costumes\" are hideous (maybe that's why they seem so disgruntled).  The noise level of this place is equal to a club, hope ya like to lean in and shout to one another!"

My wife had a chicken pie and my brother a lamb burger. We all enjoyed our meals. I'm only giving our experience 3 stars for a few reasons. The service was disappointing with our waitress forgetting our fries (she didn't write it down) and not seeming too concerned when we told her there was broken glass under our table. At $60 I would have expected better quality for the Cabernet on the menu. It came out cold and overall was pretty average for a local wine at that price point. I wouldn't be ordering wine there again."

We made reservations and went up to our rooms to rest prior to eating.\n\nWe were seated quickly and were entertained with World Cup Soccer on the TVs around us. We had very attentive waitstaff. There was a nice selection of beer on tap, which made my dining companions happy. We started with the fried calamari, which was yummy. I appreciated that they included the tentacle pieces since those are my favorite. What was pretty gross was the pond of grease that was at the bottom of the paper when we finished our meal. The kitchen needs to be a better job of draining the grease before serving.\n\nI had the BLT Duo. I wish I knew it was served cold ahead of time. Cold pork just isn't my thing. The pulled pork was more of a pulled pork salad since it was mixed with a light creamy dressing. A thick cold piece of bacon on top was less than appetizing. Minus a star right there. Again, I wish I knew ahead of time that it was served cold. I would definitely not order this again.\n\nOne companion ordered the NY Strip. His comment was that it was much better than the NY steak at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. It came with a tiny portion of fingerling potatoes and asparagus. He asked the server for a piece of bread since the meal was pretty rich. The server said no. He indicated he would need to order the appetizer pretzel bread. This seemed unreasonable as we saw other dishes that had bread. This 80+ year old man wanted a small piece of bread with his steak. Seriously, the waiter should have brought him a piece of bread on the house. It's not like we didn't each order a full meal, plus appetizer and drinks from the bar. They lost 2 stars and a percentage of their tip right there. \n\nThe other companion ordered the curry chicken. It's an Indian curry served with a side of chutney. I thought it was just ok, but my companion really liked it. By the end of the meal he was sweating from the spices.\n\nOne last point: The seating is meant to be like a pub. Each table had different style of chairs and tables. Some were regular restaurant table and chairs, there was also traditional bar seating and other tables that were homey with high backed sitting room style chairs. We were seated on a raised table with high bar stool seats. It wasn't my preference to eat dinner on stools without back support. I wish the hostess checked in with us about this prior to seating, especially considering we had a senior citizen in our party. Minus one star for lack of consideration for any special needs of our party."

Hostess said around 30 min but if we found seats at bar to help ourselves and let her know. We did! That's where we are happiest anyway. Keith and Jose and a whole host of others took EXTREMELY good care of us. We ordered several different items from the menu including the scotch egg, fried oysters, and then the pork and duck rillettes. Omg. Everything was incredibly fresh, tasty and delicious in our book. The bartenders knew about different beers I asked about and advised accordingly. (I'm an IPA kind of girl). \n\nThey even changed the closest tv to something we requested with no issues. \n\nI've read countless reviews about the service here and food and while I can't account for table service, our bar service was spot on. I would happily come back and keep trying more items on the menu. I know everyone has different experiences but ours was awesome. I hope that if you are reading this review that you take the adventure and go. It was great for us...at the bar...on a Friday night. Thanks to all at GR's P&G!"

The one and only place I really wanted to go to was Gordon's Pub and Grill. We drove straight through the night from the Seattle area to be able to get there with enough time to enjoy all of the sights. Let me tell you that this was by far the biggest disappointment. I have watched EVERY show this man has EVER done and I am the biggest fan, all I wanted to do was taste his food. I ordered an 8oz steak medium rare and it was supposed to come with potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Well I got my steak and vegetables(no potatoes) my steak was rare and cold so I had to hunt down our waiter to put it back on the grill for a bit longer. He was very rude and said that I should have ordered it medium...uh no you should have just cooked it medium rare like I asked and delivered it warm not cold. When I did get it back I still had no potatoes but the steak was perfect. My waiter never did return, instead a runner named Chris brought my food out and was very nice. He even checked back with me to make sure it was good. Throughout the meal we had obviously drank all of our drinks but still no waiter. We ended up calling the manager over and he was gracious enough to comp my boyfriends meal. This only happened because he had only eaten a few bites because his burger was also under done but he didn't want to create even more of a scene than I had. All in all I would say that I wouldn't eat at this pub again do to the rudest service I had ever experienced(keep in mind that I eat in Seattle usually so I am used to larger cities and the fact that they get busy) At the end of our meal I finally found our waiter at a table filled with all women, I guess flirting was more of a priority.\n\nI wish I had a better experience this will most likely be the last vacation I get in a long time."

He said the flavor was great, but when he received it, it was barely lukewarm so it was cold before he could finish it.  The sides are separate but we both ordered smashed fingerling potatoes.  Black truffle makes this dish absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  This literally made my eyes roll back in to my head!  It was so heavenly.  My husband also tried a few of their tap beers.  The service was excellent!  They constantly checked up on us and were very attentive.  As packed as the place was, I was amazed by that.  Expect to drop some cash (almost $200 for both of us) but it was worth it in our eyes.  \nThere were only two negatives...  his steak being barely lukewarm and the music was SO loud that we had a hard time talking.

Coupled with having to flag down another server to find our server makes this the worst food experience on this trip."

            "review": "My husband and I had lunch on a Friday while in Vegas for a long weekend. We split a couple sandwiches (corned beef and the Pub BLT - each $18 on the menu). I happened to notice from the menu that the burgers came with fries, the sandwiches chips, so when the waitress asked if would we like chips or fries, it was a nice surprise.  We said \"one of each then, great, thank you!\"  End of story. The food was OK. Both sandwiches came on thick toast and quite frankly, started to irritate my mouth. But no biggie. Our waitress then full on disappeared -- never to be seen again. But the bill finally came once we flagged someone else down and both sandwiches rang up at $19.00, and it listed \"truffle fries\" for an extra $3.00. Are you kidding me?  No one ever said anything about an extra charge for fries, nor anything about \"truffle\"!  And after re-checking the menu, it shows \"truffle chips\" something or other as an appetizer. That's the only mention of \"truffle\" anywhere!  Then the manager wanted to say the $19 instead of $18 charge for the sandwiches was the waitress' mistake regarding a \"dinner portion something or other\".   Ohhhh Bull s....  \n\nYea, yea, $5 ...no big deal. I'm sorry....them trying to get us for $5 is a BIG DEAL!  \n\nPretty disappointed Gordon!!!!!!!!"

It's also very loud once you do get seated, having a conversation is nearly impossible.  Add to that the fact that I was sitting at a small table for two in an arm chair that belongs next to a fireplace putting the table at approximately the height of my armpits, it made for an uncomfortable dining experience logistically speaking.  Once I resigned myself to the fact that I could not fit in a booster seat and who has phone books to sit on anymore,  the food was really quite good.  I ordered the salmon which was cooked to perfection and my husband ordered the burger which was also very good.  The real star, however, was dessert.  We shared the pumpkin bread caramel layered thing (I cannot remember what it was called) and savored every last morsel.  Just don't order the cucumber vodka drink - it's not even worth remembering what it's called.  The Ramsay something-or-other.  That was $15 I'll never get back."

I liked that they incorporated tablets/iPads into their drink and dessert menu, very modern. The food selections were your usual pub fare (fries, burgers, etc.) with some nicer exceptions (scallops, fresh fish, etc.). We tried the sliders (called something else) and the scallops, very fresh and tasty. The only small nit-picky complaint was that the entrees were not very hot when they arrived, but still were wonderfully prepared. The pretzel and cheese free bread appetizer was so yummy, I'd go back just for that! Overall, a good experience, but be prepared to pay for it! With no drinks (sodas or alcohol) the total was $100 bill for four items. Hint: Make a reservation! We walked right in with a reservation but others were waiting for over an hour on a Saturday night."

I had saved over a year for my 40th birthday celebration, prepared to make this an experience of a lifetime, until all the friends I invited bailed leaving me spending my 40th in Vegas with my ex-boyfriend/best friend. We decided to make it a lavish affair, buying backstage passes to \"O\" and booking reservations at Gordon Ramsay Steak, fulfilling dreams I thought beyond my reach.\n\nJuly 27th , 2013 - Dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak\n\nI have watched every episode of Hell's Kitchen so we decide to splurge and order the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu with Wine Pairings, fulfilling both my foodie and photographic dreams to eat, and capture food perfection. Our waiter William, and sommelier Thomas were fantastic and might even remember me as the girl in the pink tutu and rainbow furries. Every moment was savoured and devoured, as an evening of good food should be.  Christina Wilson was the chef that day, and I remember happily paying our $600 bill upon receiving my sealed, numbered, souvenir menus to take home.\n\nWhat we didn't know as we dressed to see \"O\" the next day is that those menus were already gone, it was not until I looked through the pictures while on the plane and confirmed with my friend when I returned to Canada that we realized neither of us had packed them...because the maid had thrown them out.\n\nI contacted the hotel to search for them, not realizing at first that they were not even in our room on the last day. After a lengthy investigation (6 months), I was informed Planet Hollywood was not accepting responsibility for my menus, and therefore consider the matter closed. I was heartbroken. I attempted to reach out to Gordon Ramsay Steak, it was certainly not the restaurants' fault, but I thought I'd tell them my story in case they could reprint my menus or something. I called the restaurant on multiple occasions, being put on hold and transferred over and over again to the hotel. I never did manage to talk to anyone at the restaurant, until a recent visit to Vegas (April 2015) with my 13 year old daughter.  I wanted to show her where I had discovered my food love, and took a chance on approaching the hostess, I don't think I got one sentence out before I realized she wasn't even listening and then dismissed me saying sorry there is nothing we can do.  Deflated once more, I gave up on having any chance of fixing this situation and thought I had moved on, until tonight.\n\nJune 19th, 2015 - Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill\n\nWe meet our lovely and kind waitress Elyse, while grabbing a late dinner before our first night @EDC.  Throughout the course of our delicious meal I share the story of my 40th birthday, the amazing food and sad ending, tears begin to fall.  Elyse decides to make this dinner extra special, and brings me a piece of fabulous sticky toffee pudding closely followed by Scott Cummings carrying an autographed menu, I was over the moon.  While being regaled with Gordon Ramsay stories, Randall (the Bar Manager) brings me a couple of lovely mementos and asked to share my story on Yelp.  I want to send a huge heartfelt thank you to all of the wonderful staff I have been so fortunate to meet at Gordon Ramsay's Restaurants; it's more than orgasmic food!"

She whisked it away and brought it back proudly announcing that she had them through it back on the grill for me. It was so lack luster I barely ate half. The sides were tasty .

Boy was I ever HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED with both the service and the menu.  I was told by the hostess that they did indeed have a gluten free menu, however when I asked for the GF menu at the table I was told the gluten free menu was \"not up to date\" -- which in short meant \"non-existent\".  Food that should be \"clean and free of gluten\" had added gluten (the shrimp for shrimp cocktails is poached in beer).  The waiter pointed out in a snarky manner that I could eat \"most\" of the beef (steak) selections and salad; his attitude was visible wth slumped shoulders and short, snippy sentences.  Not one single chicken item was a safe choice.  I finally just stood up and said I could eat Salad ANYWHERE.  I left and I will not be back although I stay at Caesars 4-5 times per year. The waiter finally realized when I stood up that I was angry and I did make my comments heard by the surrounding tables.  I don't think Gordon Ramsay realizes that Celiacs AND THEIR FAMILIES will not dine where it is not safe for the entire family to eat.  We went directly to Mesa Grill where I was treated with respect and offered many appealing GF food items.  The chef and manager assured me in person that they knew what they were doing.  And the food was scrumptious.  \n\nBad, bad, bad experience--Celiacs and gluten sensitive folks beware of Gordon Ramsay establishments."

OK so they're busy - a good sign I thought. We arrived at the appointed time, and there were about 20 people lined up for tables. Our table was ready so we went straight in.\n\nService was terrible! We struggled to get the attention of a waiter to order drinks, and food. Drinks were slow to come to the table (maybe within 30 mins of sitting down), and the food took over an hour and 15mins to arrive! They got some of the orders wrong too. The place was not full, almost empty by the time we got our food.\n\nWithin 5 minutes of our food arriving (by then 11.10pm) they turned the lights down, and down, all the way to almost complete darkness. We were eating in the dark! The waiters were using their iPhones flashlight just to see where they were going. We asked a passing waiter to turn the lights back on, he said he would have to ask his manager - eventually they turned them up a bit.\n\nThe food was hit and miss. Fish and Chips - great fish, light fluffy batter, but disappointing chips - giant slabs of potato that were not crunchy or flavorful. It came with \"house made tomato sauce\" which tasted *exactly* like Heinz Ketchup.\n\nMy friends weren't raving about their food either, some was good, some average.\n\nIf Gordon was there he would've slammed this place shut until they got their act together."

All of us sunk.  Me, a 6' foot tall man, having to arch my arms up to grasp a fork and knife.  I felt worse for the girls.  I used to work with interior designers so all I could think of was, \"Who picked out these disfunctional chairs for the restaurant?  Does anyone height check to see that they are suitable to dine in?  Are there some telephone books I can put beneath my bottom so that I can see what's on the table?\"  \n\nVery important... There are two menus here.  The full dinner menu and the bar snacks/small bites menu.  No matter where you sit in the restaurant (at the bar or not), you can order from the bar menu.  If your server doesn't hand one to you ask for it.  Some of the dishes over lap, but there are others that don't.  \n\nBread Basket - Good.  There were four different breads, including pretzel bread with bacon bits and caraway seed buns with pumpkin seeds on top. A salted butter and a cheese dipping sauce.  \n\nLittle Piggy Deviled Eggs - Could definitely taste the bacon in the deviled egg spread.  They serve you four egg whites empty and you fill them yourself with however much deviled egg spread you want.  It wasn't whoa crazy crazy, but everyone enjoyed these.  \n\nFresh Fried Potato Chips with Herbs & French Onion Dip - The potato chips were my favorite food of the night!  Light and crispy, perfect for snacking on.  I could've downed the whole bowl of chips myself, but I opted to share.  I think it's $2 more if you'd like them done Salt & Vinegar style.  \n\nFish and Chips/Cod and Chips - Three generously sized pieces served with mushy peas (mushed peas mixed in with whole peas) and fries.  I liked the peas better than the fries, which is sad because usually the potato always wins with me.  The fries were too soft for my liking.  \n\nPan Seared Diver Scallops - My friend loved and devoured these.  4 large scallops with artichoke hearts, carrots and spring garlic.  A light dish for pub food. \n\nSheperd's Pie - The other friend said this was okay.  No complaints.  \n\nBurger - Was okay.  My friend swapped out her fries for the Smashed Fingerling Potatoes at no extra charge.  \n\nSmashed Fingerling Potatoes - Wanna enjoy your meal that much more?  Swap out your fries (or some other side) for this.  The fingerling potatoes have much crunch and flavor than the fries.  Cooked with butter, double cream and black truffle!  Mmmm... the truffle.  So rich but so good!\n\nA few notes and thoughts:\n\nIf you don't have one, get your Caesar's Players' Club Card before eating here.  Each dish is discounted $1-2 as long as one person in your party has the free players' card.  \n\nThe restaurant is pricey considering it's \"only\" pub food.  I know, I'm in Vegas... pay to play.  But $28 fish and chips and a $20 burger?  There was no \"wow\" factor with any of the major dishes.  Food quality overall is not whoa, but it's solid.  \n\nThey have a good selection of beers, but I thought they'd have more UK beers on tap.  They didn't even have Smithwick's or Harp on tap or in a bottle.  \n\nOur server was nice and brought us all that we needed, but it took awhile to track her down a couple of times because she had too many tables to watch.  The restaurant could probably schedule a couple of extra servers on the weekends.  \n\nOverall it's 3.5 stars, with price knocking down the rating.  When it's $180 for four people with three of us having one drink each (and no wine), that's pricey for pub food."

For one I love Gordon Ramsay and this is the first time I've been to any of his restaurants!  \n\nMy awesome friend and I came here after shopping and the service was great.  Our servers name was Mike and he was really tentative and provided great input for the drinks and food on the menu.  \n\nBased on his recommendation I ordered the Pub Crawl... I was in the mood for something where I could taste the alcohol.  I never had bourbon and I wanted to try something new... Definitely a great recommendation Mike, both my friend and I really enjoyed it.  My friend had a beer, I have no idea what it's called, just came in a cool gray bottle (I don't drink beer, but it's there fav one so I'm glad they had it there)\n\nSo the food.. Uhh so good.\nFor the Starters or App we had the Pork and Duck Rillettes.  That was delicious.  I will say it was interesting as well b/c I've never had anything like it.\n\nFor the real deal we had the Fish and Chips and the Grilled Lamb Burger... OMG the burger was the kind that melts in your mouth... We took Mike's recommendation on ordering it medium... Yeah that was good.  I was a little nervous ordering fish and chips b/c I didn't think they could be any different, but once again Mike was right and the fish was amazing.  The breading melts in your mouth and doesn't fall off the fish.. Tartar sauce was good with it, and the peas were more for decoration for me, but they were actually seasoned well too.\n\nI know Ramsay and he would have expected nothing less than perfection at one of his restaurants.  I can't wait to go back on my next visit!!  We were definitely in food heaven going here!!  I will save a little room for dessert on round 2 and I will try some of Ramsay's other places on the next visit."

For my meal, I had the pork belly roll. I had high hopes since I love pork belly, but this had more fat than actual pork. It was also so salty that I could feel my fingers swelling as I ate it. Others ordered the scallops which were terrible, as well as the shepards pie, which was dry and had no vegetables in it. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding. \n\nOverall, this place sucked. I am appalled that Gordon Ramsey yells at and denigrates people on television for their cooking skills while his own restaurant is sub-par with terrible service. I am not a fan of Gordon Ramsey. Perhaps he should take a break from acting holier than thou on TV and pay attention to his shitty restaurant."

Being seated took some time because the place was busy but I could see many unoccupied tables. Not enough help? Once seated the waitress was friendly and answered any questions we had. My husband ordered fish and chips. He wasn't impressed. He said the batter was bland. I had the sliders and although greasy they were very tasty.

Normally I am very easy going and am not motivated to give a place a bad review (this is my first ever in fact), but in this case I feel like Mr. Ramsay has traded on his name as a stickler for quality and there was little to be found here. We've dined at Gordon Ramsay Steak and it was very good so this came as an unwelcome surprise. The staff were generally nice, though they started to flounder when things went south. We ordered a Caesar to start and I must say that was good. However, for our lunch entrees we ordered the Shepherd's Pie and the baked Mac n' Cheese and were very disappointed with both. The shepherd's pie was average at best but barely had any vegetables in it; the Mac n' Cheese was just terrible: bland and undercooked. When my girlfriend said something about it the genius waiter went right into the classic al dente argument - nice. He offered to have it cooked more - baked more? We sent back the Mac and even with that off the bill it came to $50: one Caesar salad to share, an iced tea, a lemonade, and a small, underwhelming shepherd's pie. If that suits you then look no further!"

It also brought back a bar set very high when it comes to food, service, atmosphere and everything that you should expect when dining in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. \nWe had a 2pm reservation for fellow Elite Allison's birthday. She went with lunch for the group because it could be quite spendy depending on what you get. Well worth it for a celebration in my opinion. \nBetween our group we had fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, scallops, the pot pie trio, and a couple burgers. Also, deviled eggs, pretzel bread, and Caesar salad for starters. I was lucky enough to try the majority of this stuff, and what stood out the most was: 1. The scallops. Not even a scallop fan but these melted like butter in your mouth. I would think Chef Ramsay was standing over the cook calling him a bloody donkey to make sure they were correct. 2. The lobster mac. HUGE chunks of lobster and a cheese that didn't overtake the flavor, but wasn't too bland either. 3. The deviled eggs. You stuff them yourself, and they have bacon. Need I say more? \nEverything was delicious and I would order everything again. That says a lot. \nThe negatives, not much but they should have complimentary bread. When a burger cost $20-25, you could start with a little something. 2. The service was EH. Our first initial guy Chris, was great. But he left mid lunch and our next guy wasn't nearly as attentive or funny. He did not seem to enjoy his job as much. I wish we had have given the tip to Chris before he bounced, he earned it. The hostess were also a little snooty. Like hello, you are pretty, you're working for a famous chef, and you get to wear a cute dress to work- SMILE it won't hurt. \n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives by far which is why this is still a 4 star review. Until next time."

I was expecting the pie sampler to come in decent sized custard dishes. Instead they came out in this weird wooden rack that could have held 5 of these tiny dishes. Had they been the custard dish I was expecting, 3 dishes would have easily filled this.  Instead you are left with this massive wooden rack and these tiny awkward dishes.  Kind of cool presentation, I guess?  But really just stupid, and pretentious.  The steak pie was by far the best tasting. The Shepherd's pie, which the waitress suggested had a strange taste and smelled like dirty socks. The chicken pie was decent, yet comparable to one of those frozen Marie Calendar's pot pies you buy in bulk at Costco.  The Scotch egg however was delicious and perfectly cooked.\n\nAll said and done, $80 to not even be full or drunk."

It's been a blast but it's time to call it a day.\"\n\nDON'T STOP TOO SOON... you have one more restaurant to fix up... this one!\n\nWorst Gordon Ramsay experience we've ever had (and the first bad experience so maybe that's why I'm taking it so hard).\n\n1.  Our experience started as the hostess walked us through a reasonably open restaurant: past the \"patio\", past the bar, past the really nice booths, and all the way to the very back of the \"family room\"... where one might imagine the staff eats.  What's up with that; do we not fit your preferred demographic or is there some other reason why you did this to my family?  I'm curious; really.\n\n2.  Waitress seems to have trained at the local Denny's.  If you were here, Chef Ramsay you'd tell that 'fat cow\" to EffOff.  Ordered drinks and food.  Food got delivered (shockingly fast), then the drinks.  Not relaxing at all.\n\n3.  Fish and chips... let's talk about this please.  I'm in no way qualified to tell you how to cook, but these fish and chips were fish and fries.  I've had plenty of fish and chips in the UK, both in pubs and from small shops... and once from a place so small they didn't even have electric refrigeration.  Really... fries pretending to be chips on a plate of fish and chips???  I've seen you rip people new a-holes for misrepresenting food like this.  Oh... and we never tasted the mushy peas.  The expeditor forgot them, the runner didn't notice that the expeditor forgot them, and the waitress... well she was out to pasture and didn't notice much of anything.\n\n4.  Shepard's Pie... let's chat some more.  Served \"bare naked\" it was a disappointing sight from the moment it landed on the table.  Mash was barely browned and no garnish at all.  No visual appeal and no olfactory appeal either.  As I ate all I could hear was you saying \"season, season, season\" as you prepare to send a MasterChef contestant home for serving bland food.  Whoever the donkey is that cooked my pie... please ask him to return the apron and leave.  Please.  And those straight-sided dishes sure did make eating the mince and veg a frustrating experience.\n\n5.  Manager was finally summoned.  I was unhappy.  He was polite and kind but had an \"excuse\" for almost everything.  Fries rather than chips: \"you can order real chips on the appetizer menu\" and when asked again \"well, this is a Ramsay-twist; Las Vegas twist on a pub.\"  WTF does that mean... that you can call chips fries because we're not in the UK?  I think not.  He did the best he could to make things right and comp'd a couple of desserts to make up for the missing mushy peas.  But days later all I can remember is that we didn't have the kind of experience we should have had.\n\n6.  Oh, and let me not forget to mention... the table next to us was set for guests, but there were chips -- errr... fries, I mean -- on the floor, presumably from the last diner.  EVERYONE walked past them, over them, and past them again.  I had the pleasure of looking at squished fries on the floor as I ate my meal.  I know, I know it is my own fault: I looked (and looked again).  Manager verified that they were fries and not chips... then took 15 minutes to get them cleaned up.  But cleaned up they were... eventually.\n\n7.  Now that I've vented my spleen let me compliment a few things:  salmon was very good.  The fish on the fish-and-fries was good too.  Desserts were excellent.\n\nPlease forgive me, Chef, for having such an attitude but it is you who inspire me and you who keeps bleating \"standards\"... and I totally agree.  Standards are everything and should be maintained at all times.  I only wish they were maintained for me during our visit to your PUB."

It's perfect for two and was delicious.  \n\nAll in all, we had a great time and will definitely be making an effort to visit the other Ramsay restaurants in Vegas."

Highlights were the scallops and as crazy as it sounds the spinach side (forget the name, but its ridiculous). As for the rest of it...\nService - pretty Awful (slow, inattentive, and gave off a couldn't care less vibe) Atmosphere - Good, Prices - Fairly Steep (but then again Vegas is kinda pricey these days) we hit Vegas every year and always take a lap or three through Caesar's even when we aren't staying there, but I can say that we probably won't be hitting this Pub again when we're back in town."

Cocktails were delicious.  Service unfortunately was not good.  We sat at bar, 3 bartenders and all of them ignored us.  I eventually got their attention and they all thought the other was looking after us.  One guy took our order and made our first round of cocktails but then had to work the other side of bar.   I can't remember his name but he was great.  Anyway I love Gordon Ramsey's restaurants and his food is worth it.  Pricey but who cares when you're on vacation!"

Both were medium quality to be equated to any \"English Pub\" that reuses their oil for frying. \nAfter dinner we ordered coffee (to which no menu was offered) and dessert. The coffee came out 7min before the dessert and was luke warm at best. We had to cancel the dessert due to the bitter taste the coffee left on our pallets. \nAgain, I expected much more from GR's establishment."

Good luck finding that any where else on the strip (to all you people that are complaining about it being overpriced). \n\nThe atmosphere is very very cool! Old British pub style with a hint of the Royal Family and a dab of punk rock. Love that the restaurant has an open facade; Ceasars is such a beautiful casino, it's nice that they embraced that. Cool decor with old barrels, chairs decorated with corgis, painting of bulldogs, etc. brings a nice little bit of England to the strip.\n\nI love the food here. I've ordered many things off the menu, and all were fantastic. My favorite is the Scottish Salmon; it is made to perfection. Their bread service is really interesting as well: comes with an array of different types of bread and sticks and delicious dipping sauces - new twist on an old tradition. \n\nThe only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because of the rude hostesses at the front. Attn ladies: I understand you work at one of the busiest casinos on the strip, but don't act like you are doing me a favor by taking my reservation. We had to wait at the main entrance for 5 mins before one of them even asked if I had been helped. They were all too busy chatting to each other to attend to the long line of customers.\n\nAlso, the table service here can be a little slow as well. We weren't too bothered by that because the food was so awesome. \n\nBook a reservation online before you get here, it does get quite packed."

I had the NY Steak with a side of the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes. My steak was chewy, hard to cut, and burnt on the outside. However, the inside was fine. Maybe if I had cut off the exterior entirely then I would've enjoyed it better. The mashed potatoes were bland. I guess that's good if you're sharing at a table of people with different taste buds - it gives you the choice to season it more on your own. \n\nThe service is mediocre. Although we liked the girl who was serving us (she was friendly and helpful), she didn't come by too often and the times that she did, we didn't have food on the table yet. \n\nOverall, it was a whatever experience for me."

Jerry Seinfeld had a show we were attending and we just came to this place by chance.  Because we were early enough there was no wait for a table.  And because this is his 3rd restaurant we've been to, we had high expectations, even if it was \"a pub.\"  \n\nStarting out, I'd say that the service was chaotic.  No one came to our table after we were sat for a while.  I distinctly remember because I tried to figure out who our server was based on the hustling of servers around us, but not even those servers ever looked at us and said, \"Someone will be right with you, we'll have someone bring over waters, nothing.\" There was NO teamwork at all, just unorganized chaos. \n\nSo hubby drank a Boddington's which he can usually get at home for $1.99, and I had a martini.  Drinks were good since we knew what to expect. That is really, the best part of this whole dining experience.  Their menu was lacking at first glance.  Nothing I saw made me wish I could have more than one item...in fact after we'd been sat so long I kind of wish we could of gotten up and gone somewhere else....\n\nBut anyway, an English Ale soup and burger later we were at least not starving before the show.  But for counting this as one of our meals in Las Vegas...it was really disappointing.  I'm not giving it one star because the server that did come to us in the end was decent and tried her best.   Would I come back here for any reason?  Oh I think not.  So many places to wine and dine in Las Vegas, are you insane???  In fact... I hear the Oyster Bar calling my name......"

We were very pleased. The fries were delicious too. On another occasion, we stopped in for another beer and the pretzel. Having been to Germany, our pretzel standards are high and this pretzel was average. There are three \"sticks\" instead of one large one. The accompanying mustard is good; beer cheese is ok. I'm not certain we'd order it again. We did end up ordering the nachos that time after seeing another patron's order. They were pretty good! Made of (homemade?) potato chips instead of tortilla chips, the meat was good and the cheese was better than most other (fake cheese) nachos we've ordered. We'd probably get these again."

Walked up to the nearly deserted restaurant and was told it was an hour and a half wait. The 3 of us found seating at the bar and quickly pored over the menu. In the end we only ordered 3 things: bacon cheeseburger, chips, and a Caesar salad. When the order was put in our server, Ramon, talked to us a bit explaining about how unique the uniforms are. Then he completely ignored us, along with the rest of the staff because they were either talking about their workout routines, diet, or flirting with the waitress with the new boobs. Time passed without so much as a refill. 30 minutes later Ramon said, \"your foods not here yet?\" Clearly the empty placemat was a clue. Another 15 minutes passed and he woke up out if his stupor to again say, \"wow, your food still isn't out?!\" 2 minutes later it finally arrived. The salad was more a bowl of dressing with a few lettuce leaves. The burger and chips were extremely bland. It took another 10 minutes to flag down Ramon for the check. When it arrived we paid with 2 cards and cash. I wrote the payments down and even explained it. Well, Ramon pocketed the cash and charged my card double. I flagged him down again and pointed out his mistake. He said he must not have heard me and fixed it. All in all it was a shit experience. I would expect more from a restaurant owned my someone who has shows where he gets people and their restaurants in line. Bottom line: You're better off at a buffet."

The drink I ordered, The Pub Crawl, which was delicious, took at least 30 minutes to get. The server said that was normal cause it had 7 steps to making it. UMN, no its not normal. I think he had too many tables and not enough help - he was running around the whole time. \n\nDINNER - Loved the food so much we came back a couple days later for dinner. This time my drink, same one as before, took less than 10 minutes to get. We had great service, and were taken care of. The opening bread pretzel sticks with dips are a highlight of the meal, just don't eat too many cause they are filling! My shepards pie was the bomb.

            "review": "Worst restaurant experience in my week in Vegas!\n\nI recently visited Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill and was very excited to try it.  Our visit started out very well.  Our server was extremely professional and friendly.  It ended there, however.  I was with a party of four and we all ordered.  I ordered the lamb burger and couldn't wait to taste it, which I never did do.  I specifically asked if the burger had lettuce on it and was told no.  It had some on it when it came and the server stated that it wasn't supposed to be like that so he took it back.  This would have been fine, however, somehow my meal got \"lost\" due to our server needing to wait on a table that had a language barrier.  So I sat while my whole table ate and finished with still no food. When I flagged down our \"new\" server, he seemed not to know what was going on.  I asked for the manager, who was also not aware of the issue.  When I told her, she did offer to get me a meal, but by then it was too late.  I was not about to eat while everyone else waited for me.  She did comp our drinks, but I would have rather had my burger and enjoyed my meal.  \n\nI was so disappointed because I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, and if he puts his name on a restaurant, I expect it to be great.  The others in my party did enjoy their meals.\n\nSo, ultimately, I left hungry and annoyed!"

I don't know how she does it but she memorized all her patrons names at every table she was serving. Sarah was so complimentary of the restaurant and even commented that one of the dishes our daughter ordered was a dish that Gordan Ramsay himself eats when visiting the restaurant. (Shepard's Pie; which was awesome). Her recommended Gordan Ramsay special Good bye Blue Sky cocktail was soooo good. Her customer service outrageous! We had the Happy Hour Hell's Kitchen wings, Mini-burger and onion rings....The flavors, the tenderness the deliciousness. We have been to several restaurants while here in Las Vegas and the food has been great but nothing compares to the service and the food @ Gordan Ramsay Pub & Grill. We were also celebrating one of our daughters 30th Birthday. They delivered a birthday dessert to us at the table which was unbelievable!!! Did I mention how outstanding Sarah was??? LOL \n\nThe service does not stop there. I had to exclaim how amazing Sarah was and how she simply made this restaurant beyond good. The manager Manny Ramirez was just as extraordinary. I am sad that we don't have this restaurant in Toluca Lake, CA. (There is a restaurant for sale on the corner of Rose and Riverside in Toluca Lake, CA....Just Sayin! Oh and if you do open there can you send this staff??!!)\n\nThanks for the great food and great service. We left wanting more and wanting to come back again!!!! \n\n:)"

I ordered the fish and chips as my meal and my gf ordered the lamb burger.  Overall I'd say the entrees were pretty good.  I ordered a beer called Innis & Gunn Original to compliment my meal, I can't say enough about the beer, it was full of flavor.  I ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  This hands down has to me one of the best sweets I've ever eaten.  I don't have much of  a sweet tooth but this dessert was delicious.  \n\nThe meal itself was a little on the pricy side for being lunch but it's Vegas, so it comes with the territory.

He recommended a beer to my sister and quickly gave her a sample (she ordered a full one after). \n\nWe went with 5 people. My sister got the lamb burger and I got the fish and chips. The other 3 got the burger. We also go pretzels to munch on while we were waiting. It came with 2 sauces - course mustard and cheese. They looked hard but were very soft. \n\nFood took a while but it was very great. When I got my fish and chips, i said I could eat more than it but in fact, I couldn't even finish! The waiter said that their fish is never frozen and I believe it. It was firm, yet flaky. The batter was perfection. The only thing was the \"chips\" were more like roasted potatoes (not crispy) but were still good in their own right. Mushy peas were fresh with a hint of mint. The TARTAR SAUCE (!!) was very creamy and clearly homemade. It was worth the cost ($29).\n\nI tried my sister's lamb burger and the spices were not appealing for me, but she loved it.\n\nLastly, we tried the toffee pudding ($10) after the rave reviews! It did not disappoint! It was more like cake consistency than pudding and came with sweet cream ice cream. The server pours the toffee sauce on top. So so good!"

I then ordered a 1/2dz wings and a medium burger with fries. I was expecting u wings to come first since they were an app but when they came the burger was served at the same time...\n\nI started with the wings. The second one I bit into was raw. yuck! What a turn offfffff. They got sent back and they brought me new ones but after biting into raw chicken in the first set I couldn't think about eating them the second time around. Didn't even really want to eat my burger after that. My burger was suppose to medium but it came out medium rare and the bun was soggy but at this point I just sucked it up and just ate it. I had to ask for ketchup. When it was brought to me I thought it was cocktail sauce but was informed by the bartender that was how they made their ketchup.\n\nOver all I give you two stars for the fact that your bloody Mary's are the bomb and I appreciated the managers checking in on me. Not charging me for the wings and hooking me up with a second drink. I've been in the restaurant business for 16yrs and I know shit happens, but when both items I order come out under cooked and the guy next to me is complaining about his scallops being under cooked as well You need to step it up in your kitchen and hold up to your name. \n\nForgot to mention the menu is over priced. Your paying to be sitting in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in Caesars palace more then the quality of food and service. $35 for a burger and bloody marry. Plus tip."

We go the Bangers & Mash and Shepherd's Pie, two items that a pub should be known for. Both were good, but not great. This dishes are both around $25. We also had the English Ale Onion Soup for an appetizer. That was very good. \n\nThe second time, we went for lunch and wanted to try the fish & chips. We had Calamari for an appetizer. This was good.  Please don't go by every ones recommendation on the fish & chips. We went there just for that and we both were very disappointed. $30 for fish & chips, they better be good, but they were not. You were given 2 not very big pieces of fish and not very tasty.  Go downtown at the Main Street Station at the 777 brewery that were 100 times better at better then half the cost.\n\nBottom line, not worth the cost of the items on the menu. Way overrated.  Really disappointed in a place with Ramsay's name on it, Seriously, walk 100 ft to Bobby Flay's Mesa grill in Caesar's to get a great dinner or lunch at pretty much at the same cost. It is not a pub, but his food is so much better and would rate it a 5 over this 2. If you are a Total Rewards person, be sure you tell them for that big $1 off per selection. Both times they did not ask and had to point that put to them when the bill came, even after making a reservation online and noting our Total Rewards number."

            "review": "We went there for lunch, figured it would be nice to eat in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, even if it's a cheaper one (well, not really, let's say cheap for Vegas...). So, right off the bat, looking at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good, but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu, like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so. \n\nSo we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs, Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty, but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine, oh boy... First off, my poutine had very little of everything, very little duck, very little cheese, and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So, it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good, a good fry you can taste the potato still, not these. They didn't even seem homemade. \n\nMr. Ramsay, if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants, I'd suggest coming here, to Qu\u00e9bec City, and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places, easily, that serve better poutine, and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind, to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact, I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city, to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine, bison burgers, and more, oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck, tons of very fresh cheese curds, an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course, for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat, still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I sincerely doubt you can get your money's worth for anything there."

GR is all about presentation & plating so i think he may be disappointed to find out my dish came out very messy (or idk, maybe that's how the dish is supposed to be plated??)... see, the carrots and potatoes were randomly scattered on the plate *carelessly* imo, and the steak had a potato and carrot underneath it, like the steak was just plopped on top of the potatoes and carrots :/// i just tweeted pics of the dish from b4 and after i ate it to show the plating, and the raw carrots and fatty steak part i left behind.. dunno if he'll respond at all, but i thought i'd at least notify him of how things were done.. i also got the potted triple chocolate trifle which i LOVED. it was various layers/textures of dark, milk, and white chocolate :)) w/ a couple small cookies on the side. \n\nso i had very mixed feelings about my 1st and likely only experience at a GR restaurant as i doubt i'll have the chance to go back to vegas again (or any other location where his restaurants are). i really did have high expectations w/ his location b/c it's GR! he's all about perfection w/ taste and plating, and of course, he's anti-raw foods lol.. and then there's the horrible server i mentioned b4 who really was frustrating, if i wasn't in such a great mood about the 1st nite in vegas, i would've complained more outwardly at the time, right now, i'm wishing i had... will try to post pics of everything."

I do have to say that the service was a little slow. We got there at 5:30 on a Friday so was still early but obviously busy. But it took us over two hours to eat our meal and a lot of that time was waiting because the service was just slow. The way Gordon Ramsay behaves on TV I don't think he would've been happy with the service. However the menu is really solid. It seems they have a lot of British classics as well as some very nice upscale dishes. Here's what the table had we had the pretzel breadstick snack which was delicious it came with grainy mustard and cheese. A friend ordered the scotch egg. I can't say that I am a huge fan of the concept but it was well executed. For entr\u00e9es we had the scallops the short ribs and the tomato soup. None of these disappointed. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the sticky toffee pudding. Really do yourself a favor order the sticky toffee pudding no matter how full you are and even if you don't like dessert. It is moist, crunchy, and the sauce is soooo ridiculous!!!!"

Drinks and snacks were good and they have a pretty decent variety of beers, but they definitely have the Vegas and Gordon Ramsay price tag. Cool spot though and good people watching if you're sitting in the area open to the casino. I had the sliders and a my husband had the kettle chip nachos - sliders were good but the nachos won.

            "review": "Mr. Ramsay!!! It's been a pleasure! \n\nI've watched Hell's Kitchen, but only religiously during season 1 and 2. I highly enjoy the world of cooking and creating a meal that's enjoyable on all levels. I've wanted to eat at a Ramsay restaurant for some time now, and I finally got that chance! \n\nNow, let's talk about the atmosphere. The decorations, the barrels (or maybe kegs?) on the walls, the lighting, the choice of color, the \"British Art Decor\" on the wall; all of it was highly appealing and fit for a \"British Pub and Dinner Grill environment\". It actually encouraged to eat. Even the dang menu was fancy and red and nice, and it was pushing me to try this stuff. I loved it. \n\nNow let's get to the food. I ate 'Bangers and Mash' a traditional British meal consisting of sausages and potatoes, and this had been spruced up a bit for Ramsay's Establishment. It was a small portion (I can consume so much, so to my standards it was small), but the presentation was superb. The taste was amazing too, the potatoes were great and they deliciously went well with the three sausages I had! And those three babies had been cooked just right too, it was ridiculous. \n\nI also tried a bit of the \"Rueben sand which\", a corned beef, rye breaded and Swiss cheesed (mind the grammar) American made meal. The Rueben was great; it fell apart nicely with one bite. Not too tough to overcome at all. The bread was soft and tasty and the meat tasted great as well. \n\nFinally, I had some a delicious spot of some cake. Not too sure what it was but at first, it didn't look too appealing. And then man. Bit into that buggar and my mouth was having a holiday. Again, the quality was great and it came apart quite nice in my mouth, and the taste just overtook my tongue. It was not too sweet at all, it was probably one of the best desserts I've had for some time. \n\nNow, price wise? Quite the tab, but quality definitely ran rampant in the meal I devoured. You definitely get some high quality chow that doesn't disappoint. I'm really starting to appreciate this sort of eating. \n\nI also highly appreciated being able to eat some actual European themed food. It's not too often that you come upon a British or German restaurant. Heck, it's hard enough to find something Norwegian or Scottish. Most European themed places are Irish pubs for the most part. It was great to actually be cultured with some English recipes. \n\nWould o return? Definitely would. My only disappointment was not being able to see Gordon Ramsay yell at some. But we can't all get everything we want."

The menu was very limited when it came to vegetarian options for me, but I decided to order the soft pretzels.  My brother asked if the mini burgers or truffle fries were better since he was not very hungry; the server suggested he get both and would not comment further.  I asked what wines they served by the glass and when he mentioned there was a Malbec, I inquired what the price was.  The server quoted $9-11.  I said ok.  Our food arrived and the pretzels were a variety including plain, herbed and bacon/cheddar.  I told the server I was a vegetarian and he looked shocked.  He did replace it with another plain one, but the pretzels were rock hard and I could barely bite into them.  My brother enjoyed his mini pub burgers, but there were items on the burger not listed on the menu.  We were mostly ignored after we made it clear we were only there for appetizers.  We were sitting at a highboy table, with uncomfortable chairs.  I received the bill and was charged $13.50 for my glass of wine.  I didn't even bother to bring it up because I just wanted to get out of there.  I would not go back or recommend it to anyone."

We are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay.  We had just selected our food and drinks when my husband had a sudden nosebleed and had to leave to go to the washroom.  The drinks came.... I placed our order........the food came.......I tried to eat  my chopped pub salad (which was delicious).....and my husband still wasn't back.  Our server VERY discretely asked if everything was ok and when I explained the situation he offered to go check on him.  He alerted his Supervisor who also discreetly offered assistance.  After 45 minutes, when the medical situation was under control we thanked our server and as we were getting ready to leave the Manager also came by to ensure that everything was under control before we left.  The restaurant was very busy but the Manager spent considerable time to make us feel comfortable and valued.  \n\nEveryone in this establishment went above and beyond during a very busy time.

I will say that my drink the garden spritz was awesome! \n\nWe had the lamb burger and the regular burger. The lamb burger was great, but the other burger had to be sent back, it was supposed to be rare but it came out medium, and we requested truffle oil on our fries, but that didn't happen either. Props does go out to our waitress ( I do not have her name :(, but she lived in Mexico prior) who took care of us, she insisted on returning the burger and fixed the fries. We also had the sticky pudding, which I'd order again and the bread pudding was also yummy. \n\nI guess the one thing that bothers me is that on Kitchen Nightmares you have Mr. Ramsay saving other restaurants, but this our third time at one of his and I have yet to say Wow, you can tell Gordon Ramsay \"the dude from TV\" owns this place. \n\nThe floor to the bathroom was so greasy my husband and I had to hold on while walking. We were joking about the lawsuit that is just waiting to happen. And the men's bathroom was missing toilet paper and when they brought it, it didn't fit the holder. Silly things that are huge lazy oversights from management and are the kind of things that Mr. Ramsay would fix on his TV show. \n\nSo, Mr. Ramsay if you or your staff read this, keep in mind that we don't just rate the food. I was a restaurant/bar manager in NYC for 11 years and I totally understand things happen, but if it hadn't been for our waitress, who seemed to be acting out of her experience and not out of her GR P& G training, I would have given you two stars."

Sat at the bar, which has full menu service.  Got a scotch egg for an appetizer, the brown mustard on top definitely opened up the nasal passages, but it had great flavor.\n\nHad to get the fish and chips for my main entree, after all I was in a pub!  I was expecting the fish to be more like I was used to, strips of fish deep fried, and for there to be 4 or so strips.  Instead what I go were two large pieces of fish, cooked to a nice golden brown.  The fish was excellent and not too greasy, the chips on the other hand were a soggy mess.  They came out over cooked for the most part, and with a burnt oily flavor to them.  I was sadly disappointed in them and didn't even finish them all.\n\nThe two bartenders behind the bar gave great service, always ensuring I had a full drink and seeing if I needed anything else without being too overbearing.  Overall I would say I will give GR Pub & Grill a second chance, but may just steer clear of the chips the second go around."

She brought the check to the table, said sorry guys, turned and walked away! This was the worst service we have ever received. The manager made an excuse for poor service, blamed us for ordering  a medium well burger and did not care to even try and make the situation right.

I made sure I called and made a reservation a couple weeks in advanced for lunch. \n\nWhen we got there everything was set! We were seated quickly at a large table in the back. It was cool because I could lean back in the seat I was in and see right into the kitchen, which was awesome!! Our waiter took our drink orders while my party arrived and looked over the menu. Pricey yes! But I totally knew this going in and was not shocked. My fellow Yelper and good friend Dyanna L. asked the waiter what his suggestions were. First thing out of his mouth was the Seared Scallops. This totally helped me in my picking process! \n\nOk, so for the food, it was ALL excellent! Let me start out with the appetizers. We ordered the Mini Pub Burgers which were three perfect little sliders with bacon, lettuce, onion, and a little side of mayo. The Calamari was fried perfectly and they even used the leg parts (my fav) it came with a side of tartar sauce and a side of cocktail sauce. The Deviled Eggs I did not try, but the presentation was awesome. Instead of the eggs being filled you get to fill the eggs yourself! We also ordered the warm pretzels that came with a delicious cheese spread and a tangy mustard. \n\nFor our entrees I finally decided on the Seared Scallops. Yummy!!! They were perfectly cooked and came in a cream broth with small clams, leeks, and potatoes! I wanted to tip the bowl up and drink the rest of the broth, but I remembered my manners. lol My husband chose the Shepards Pie. It was tender and filled to the brim with meat and veggies! Dyanna L. chose the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Omg was it filled with lobster!!! I was in heaven when she offered me a bite! She also had a Caesar Salad that looked very tasty! Her boyfriend got the Fish and Chips. It looked so crispy. I'm totally getting that next time! My other friend Rachael ordered the Mini Pie Tasting. It came with three little pies one was a Shepards Pie. The other was a Steak and Ale Pie. That was her favorite one. The last of the three was a Chicken Pot Pie. My other friends Becki and Eric got Lamb Burgers that where huge and came with crispy fries! \n\nOther than the service being a little slow, it was a great experience overall, but I think it was because our original waiter was sent home in the middle of our visit. I loved all the food. This is a great place for a special occasion! Just be prepared to drop some cash, but it's completely worth it! Yummy!"

Between the uncomfortable seating arrangement, non enthusiastic waiter and barely  edible food this is the last time I go there and has now made me question Gordon Ramsay as a chef.

Gordon's was the best thing I have ever had.  I will be back again and again. Finally a famous chief opens a very approachable place and blows away expectations. Good Job!!!"

We both thought it would be a good idea for an early dinner.  I wasn't sure what the crowd was like so I made reservations just in case.   We were greeted and seated immediately.   As the hostess was walking us to our table, that was the point I noticed how large the place really was.  There is an abundance of seating throughout.  Scott was our waiter for the evening.  He was attentive and friendly.  \n\nWith Yelp friends like Stefany, we can order and split items.  We decided on the Grilled Lamb Burger with fries, Lobster and shrimp rolls and Kettle Chip Nachos.  All delicious and tasty!  Here's the low down:  The kettle chip nachos had a decent amount of tender short ribs scatter about topped with an English cheddar cheese.  The house made kettle chip was delightfully crunchy and sturdy to hold the nacho toppings.  \n\nThe lobster & shrimp rolls were also a hit.  They had a light lemon zest already blended in the lobster & shrimp mix.  This little brioche sandwich is delectable.  \n\nThe Grilled Lamb Burger was probably the highlight for me.  Grilled perfectly, this burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The goat & feta cheese spread really clinched the blue ribbon.  BUT WAIT! The accompanying french fries are served with a garlic aioli that is to die for! Phenomenal.  I wanted to take a to go bowl of that home but I think that was frowned upon.  \n\nG.R. has once again impressed me with his menus and food."

Service was just ok.  We are locals and the waiter honestly seemed more interested in finding out our opinion about the city such as houses and where to live as he was new in town.  He was friendly, however he didn't do very much as a server. Once we got our food he was pretty much gone.  The food was honestly a disappointment.  I ordered the Shepard's pie.  Gordon Ramsay is always talking about his Shepard's pie so I wanted something great.  What I got was eh...ok.  It really was just pot roast with severely undercooked crunchy semi-raw veggies topped with un seasoned mash potatoes.  Good idea but severely poorly executed.  The pot roast was super watery making the dish a big mushy mess.  Having ordered sticky toffee pudding from Gordon Ramsay Steak and absolutely loving it, I thought I would order it here and maybe find a possibly cheaper fix to my craving.  I was disappointed.  Sadly the pudding was overcooked and hard chewy on the outside and dry inside.  The place has a good concept, but the wait staff is lacking and the kitchen staff is lacking execution. Next time I want to an English Pub in Vegas, I'll head over to the Crown and Anchor on Tropicana.  A quarter of the price, and taste better."

I'm glad to have been proven wrong at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill in Caesar's Palace.\n\nMy friend and I were in there at around 2:00 on a Sunday.  The place was hoppin', but we found a couple of seats at the bar and were promptly greeted by a really friendly bartender.  I asked him a few questions about the beer selection, describing the flavor profiles that I like.  He brought me several samples and was able to speak knowledgeably about the vast array of beers on offer.  I know it's kind of lame, but in the end I decided to stick with Peroni.  Hey, it was 109 degrees out, I had just walked all over creation, and I wanted something on the lighter but flavorful side.  \n\nMy friend had a couple of mojitos, prepared by the same bartender.  She said they were amazing.\n\nWe both ordered the burger.  My friend ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well.  Both were cooked to perfection.  We both opted for the cheese and bacon toppings (because you just kind of have to, right?).  We both had gruyere.  It was melted, nutty, aromatic, and delicious.  The bacon, while thick, was still very crispy, and richly maple flavored.  It was a delicious meal with layer upon layer of fantastic flavors.  \n\nMy friend ordered dessert (some rhubarb tart) and she said it was delicious.  \n\nMy meal (burger, fries, two imperial pints) put me back $40.  Not bad at all.\n\nI highly recommend this place.  Give Wolfgang a miss and come straight to Gordon!!"

Had a unique flavor and was worth the $10.  For lunch I had the Pub Burger, I ordered it rare and it came well done and was extremely dry and salty.  And if you are a bigger person, the burger is small.  (Worked out for me, but smaller than one would expect for $20).  The fries that came with it were very good, had shavings of cheese on them, I mostly ate the fries and the burger was not so good.  This place was not horrible, but for Vegas, you expect exceptional food, this was not exceptional.

They only had room for us at the cocktail tables, and the stools were very squishy and sinking down, but had hard edges, so my legs kept falling asleep. \n\nOur server was very friendly, but our food was somewhat slow to come out. With the location right on the casino floor, there was a man smoking a large cigar in line to get a rewards card, and the smoke cloud was almost intolerable, of course our food finally came out while the smoke cloud was hanging over us.\n\nThe food was very good. We ordered a NY strip that was surprisingly tender for a NY and cooked perfectly, but had a chunk of gristle. It was very good value compared to Mesa Grill, maybe not quite as good, but also much cheaper. Asparagus cooked well. Peppercorn sauce had an overwhelming rosemary flavor, but was good.\n\nThe pub chopped salad was also good. I think for a similar price, Cheesecake Factory has a better salad, and their portions are three times as big. The menu indicated the salad had apples, which I do not remember on the salad. The ham was more like strips of salami perhaps? It was very good, though.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were good, but the STAR of the show was the mushroom side with poached egg. This is brilliant! The egg, and I think chanterelle mushrooms, had similar texture and it was a wonderful and unexpected combination. Loved that.\n\nThe server wasn't able to adequately describe the toffee pudding. She described it as a cake. Maybe it was; her description was vague enough that I didn't want to try it.\n\nIf I were to return, I'd make sure I had a reservation and ask to be seated farther into the restaurant. I think I'd try the fish and chips next time. They looked fantastic."

We were sat down right away in the back and our wait was named Adam. Actually we had two waiters and both their names was Adam.\n\nWe got our drinks and started off with the Short rib nachos. These nachos were actually better than the last time I was here and those were off the hook!\n\nI had the Bacon Burger and my wife had the pulled Pork sandwich. My friend had the fish and chips - recommended by Adam.\n\nMy bacon Burger came and was well done like I asked. It came with a cone of fries, and to my surprise there was a lot more fries than I expected.\n\nFish and chips- My friends plate was huge and the fish was very fresh tasting. He is a big seafood eater and was happy with both the taste and the size. He stated the batter was perfect. Not a little fish overwhelmed by 10 pounds of fried batter. These were giant fish pieces.\n\nMy wives pulled pork sandwich was actually a little larger than she was expecting. She could only eat half. This plate comes with homemade chips as well. She has tried pulled pork sandwiches at some of the best places in Vegas and rate this the best. She likes it more than the Guy Fieri pulled pork sandwich, which I think is one of the best in Vegas.\n\nBangers and Mash: which consisted of chicken, beef & pork english sausages w/ mash potatoes, sauerkraut & onion gravy. My friends wife cleared this plate in no time. She ordered it without Sauerkraut (Which is a crime in most states) She stated that this was a very good dish as well and wasn't greasy like some sausages are.\n\nWe had a lot of drinks, between the Belgium Margs, Good Bye Blue Sky, Pub Crawl- wow were were feeling good after our meal. Drinks were 15 dollars a pop which is about right for a strip restaurant. \n\nBoth Waiters names Adam were great and met our every needs. They let us have a good time and knew the meaning of the service industry! We will be back in Nov for sure!!\n\nSilly Tip that might only interest me: If your getting a to-go box, they are awesome and are like little Tupperware boxes. Can be easily reused :)"

Overall, there are many better choices in Vegas to dine at and would not even give it a second chance.\n\nReservation/Atmosphere - We had a reservation but were seated at a bad location and bad table. They put to tables in a walk way area and then put short chairs around it. They were mix & matching the dining tables and chairs to squeeze in more people. The low bar chairs made us feel like we were at the kids table during Thanksgiving. Before we started I asked to be re-seated but they came up with excuses (30 minutes and no guarantee) and a little attitude. The waitress acknowledged the table/seats wasn't good but not much they would due. Given the time and not delaying the dinner we took it, but it was annoying and uncomfortable. \n\nThe music was way too loud when we arrived and after about 30 minutes it was turned down, probably someone complained. Hard to believe that management couldn't tell that it was too loud even for Vegas.\n\nService - Pretty good, attentive enough given that they were busy.\n\nFood - Here is the second reason I wouldn't go back. The food we had was average, and I expected a lot more. Bangers & Mash was only ok. Fish & Chips were also only ok, same you can get at any sports bar. The Braised Short Ribs was a huge disappointment, the meat had a lack of any flavor, the sauce was boring and the risotto was flavorless & held too long. I really expected the quality to be better on this dish. The highlight of the night was the Chicken Pot Pie, it had a flakey crust and some great flavor for the filing, good chucks of chicken and veggies. Deserts were ok, the Sticky Toffee Pudding was the highlight.\n\nThey were very busy as expected on a Saturday night, but it showed in their arrogance over the table & waits. They we stay busy with first time diners but don't believe they will get many as repeat. They are pricey, which I am ok with, but they need to deliver on the food and they failed there."

Ambience with great service made this a fun place to experience."

            "review": "This is one of those place that you had to try at least once in your lifetime...\n\nRiding on the coat tails of Ramsay's popularity, I came here for dinner one night with my mother.  After a day of high-rolling gambling (nickel slots), I was interested in trying this place out.  We were not in the mood for burgers (that's why we passed on Ramsay's Burgr) and didn't feel like taking out a loan to dine at Ramsay's Steak at the Paris casino.  So being the penny-pincher that I am, I opted for Pub & Grille since a) it was somewhat affordable, b) it was close-by (walking distance from where we were staying), and c) had food items on the menu that we were interested in trying.\n\nSince it was on a weekday, the hostess said that reservations were not necessary but it would be a good idea.  So I made a reservation for 7:00 p.m. and continued with my high-rolling ways until then.  We got there a few minutes before 7:00 p.m. and was a bit surprised that the place was nearly empty.  There were a few patrons sitting in the front for drinks but not many for food.\n\nThe dining area was pretty nice; it was fairly dim but not too dark that we couldn't read the menu.  The entire restaurant was spotless and well decorated.  There was this huge poster of Ramsay on the wall just staring at the patrons, which was intimidating yet sort of funny.\n\nSince my mother and I are relatively small eaters, we shared the fish n' chips and a side of braised vegetables.  The fish n' chips were nearly $30 so it better be good!\n\nAnd it was!  I was probably one of the best fish n' chips I ever had.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flaky and the batter was not heavy/oily at all.  The fish was not overwhelmed by the batter.  The braised vegetables was perfectly cooked; it wasn't mushy and the flavor of each individual vegetable was preserved.  There was a light covering of butter but not too much; it complemented the dish perfectly.\n\nOur server was very nice and attentive; checked on us every so often to make sure our meal was pleasant.\n\nOverall my experience at Pub & Grille was positive.  Both my mother and I agreed that the quality of food was outstanding (agreement between us is very rare!).  \n\nGreat place to eat if you're tired of buffets!"

Also, serving frozen, not fresh or per cooked food is also a no-no. I paid $ 70 for shepherd's, fish and chips, and one drink. And I hate to say it came out within 5 minutes. The food beat the drink to the table. The drink was delicious and very freshly made. The service was impeccable. My girlfriend's fish had bones in it and it tasted frozen. The fries also tasted frozen. My Shepherd's pie was OK but could of been better. My expectations were very high and I am quite disappointed."

My husband and I both ordered the same items Fish and Chips and the Cauliflower soup both times and I felt the quality and attention to detail was not as good compared to or original visit.

After finding Gordon Ramsay's last year and liking the food we decided to make this our first stop for happy hour on the day we got there. We decided to sit in the bar area and were immediately greeted by our bartender Ray Ray. Ray Ray asked us if we were right or left handed as to make it easier to pick up our drinks. After talking to Ray Ray he congratulated us on our wedding. We went back two days later on a Friday and Ray Ray was once again behind the bar and not only remembered us but also remembered we were newlyweds which I found amazing as Gordon Ramsay's is right on the gaming floor in the middle of Cesar's Palace. Ray Ray was once again very hospitable and even gave us a free Sticky Toffee Pudding which was amazing as were the pretzels, deviled eggs, and sliders we ordered. If you are ever in Vegas and want to go to a celebrity chefs restautant make sure to check out Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill."

Having been a fan of his many cooking reality shows we decided to eat at the grill at Cesars Palace.Things quickly went down hill after being seated in a tiny table stuck next to a row of 4 cramped tables with barely breathing room. Our waiter was the worst I have ever encountered after eating out for 30 years at some of the better to best restaurants in the US and Europe. He repeatedly ignored us and after sitting for 30 minutes without a drink I complained to the management who got us started with our cocktails. This caused our waiter to futher act out in a blatant passive aggressive way. He did not smile, gave us no eye contact but plenty of attitude as he sarcastically announced with each entree \"is this good enough for you\". I literally wanted to put the food up his U KNOW WHAT but we were hungry and would have been late for our show so we had to put up wth this clown. While ordering, they had 'RUN OUT \" of 3 of the 4 items????. Sounded odd. Anyway the shepards pie was ok, the lobster mac and cheese very salty and my memory is a wash with the rest of the meal. Thus I conclude that it must not have been memorable. I was so irritated with this snarky, pompous jack ass of a waiter it was all I could do to contain myself.\nThe one plus was dessert some kind of bread pudding that was super sweet but definitely the best among the items ordered . Just when I thought things were bad enough I went into the rest room. Had I done that first thing, I would NEVER have eaten at this establishment. It was FILTHY. Yes! you may find it hard to believe, I DID but the smell and look of the toilet was as if they had not cleaned it. Rather disgusting what was on the toilet seat thus I will NOT describe it in case you are as visual as I am. I still can't get the imagery out of my mind a month later. When it came to soap supplies, they had 1 little bottle of soap for 4 sinks and plenty of patrons waiting like kindergardeners to get a squirt of the stuff. A 50 plus year old to my left erupted and questioned the staff and was seen on my way out complaining to upper management. Tell you what, for such a fussy chef with his noteriety of perfectionistic standards, he should visit the place he sold his name to on the sly and see for himself. A real let down and all around dive with absolutely lazy staff that needs a major attitude over haul. I would never recommend this place."

You can taste the slight distinctiveness of the lamb without it being overwhelming. The burger was also flawlessly cooked to a MedRare.

Gordon you're building an empire, but it's all in about the quality, and our recent experience at your Pub questions how much you are involved."

            "review": "Family trip to Vegas, quite a few Ramsey fans amongst us.  Total of 8 diners off of the grill menu.  We made a reservation and our table was ready for us.\n\nService - Solid.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable.  The staff was attentive to our needs with regard to keeping water full and table clear.  My only complaint would be the drink menu.  I can dig conserving paper and flashy electronics, but passing a couple iPads around to place drink orders was a bit of a hassle.\n\nAmbiance - I liked it.  I wouldn't call it a traditional pub, but the feel is there.  The noise level is moderate, with an eclectic mix of British rock/pop on the playlist.  The uniforms fit with the theme.  I work with beer for a living and I am without a doubt overly anal retentive with regards to it.  So, a wall made of kegs in a British themed pub didn't sit right with me.  Casks would have been much more appropriate.  Speaking of casks . . .\n\nBeverages - Admittedly, we were all looking at beer, it's a pub after all.  For everyday beer selection, I'd give it a big thumbs up.  Lots of imported and expected domestic draft options, and a more craft friendly bottle selection.  I got a Union Jack, brother got a Sculpin, mom got a SNPA.  Their's was fresh, mine wasn't.  Que Sera, at least the options were there.  I would say this is more disappointing after visiting BURGR this afternoon and being offered a much more impressive beer list.  Lastly, it is a Pub, how is there nothing on cask?  If you are an avid beer advocate temper your expectations.\n\nFood - Not one of the 8 off us left disappointed or hungry.  Between the 8 of us we tried the Pork and Lamb Rillettes appetizer, Lamb T-bone, Shepard's Pie, Brick Pressed Cornish Hen, Clams and Mussels, Pork Belly and sides of Brusselspouts and Fingerling Potatoes.\n\nBread and starters: The bread, holy geez the bread.  A selection of pretzel breads and a beer roll served with Devonshire butter and a Welsh cheddar spread with horseradish.  I can't believe they don't charge for this, it is easily one of the best things that was put on our table.  The Rillettes were excellent as well.  I favored the pork over the duck, which admittedly was a bit bland for duck.  It comes with a fabulous horseradish infused mustard, crispy acidic house made pickles of carrot and radish.\n\nMains - I am going to jump right to it.  Everything was at least good, but the Shepard's Pie is absolutely astounding and I would say the best thing we had on the table.  The pork belly, which I ordered was very good, crispy and fatty just as it should be.  It has a pea pur\u00e9e with it that is hardly noticeable and tiny chippolini(sp?) onions for sweetness.  All together great dish I wouldn't hesitate to order again.  I did not try a clam, but the mussels were great.  They were massive and came swimming in a delicious broth and a few heels of bread to drag through it.  The hen we a little dry but, my goodness, was the skin crispy.  The lamb was well prepared, perfectly cooked.  It is topped with Stilton, which I find to be a relatively medium flavored blue cheese, but in this situation it surprisingly dominated the lamb.  It was good to be sure, but could be better.\n\nSides:  The brusselsprouts were outstanding, simply prepared with bacon and apples.  Cooked perfectly, flavorful and a great compliment to the fatty pork.  The potatoes were potatoes.  They are tough to screw up and were not here.\n\nOverall - For the 8 of us it came to just under $50/person, but I'd say that is a comfortable number for the experience we had. I wouldn't hesitate to come back."

We've both been to London and love Pub food, so we were very excited to go to the new Ramsey Pub.  \n\nFirst, the hostesses quoted an hour and a half wait even though it was off peak Sunday after 8, there were six to eight open tables and what appeared to be very few people waiting. They took my contact info and less than 30 minutes later the text came through that our table was ready. The early table was a pleasant surprise but it was obvious they weren't really keen at estimating accurate wait times.\n\nOur server was friendly but not attentive. There were a number of times we had to wait a while before he returned to our table.\n\nThe Shepard's pie was bland and not very tasty at all.  The portion was very small, which wouldn't be a big deal if they weren't charging nearly $30. It was an entree price with a tapas/small plate portion size. Everything was way overpriced, the side of mushy peas was $11. $11 for a few ounces of mashed peas? And they weren't very good either. \n\nOverall it wasn't a very positive experience and with Ramsey's name on it you certainly expect more."

My husband and I share the fried calamari appetizer, which was nice when you got a bite of calamari with the sliced chili, but was way too salty on its own. My husband enjoyed his lamb burger but thought there was way too much feta spread on it. I had the sliders, which were a bit dry, and chips with truffle aioli, which were excellent: crispy, lightly salted, and the mayo wasn't overpowering. Dessert was the best part. His famous sticky toffee pudding definitely lives up to the hype."

I watched him on TV however I didn't know what my expectations were. After eating here, this eatery met my expectations. Since this is an English pub it made sense to order the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not a big fan of meat pies as they tend to be heavy. This meat pie was hearty. I love the mashed potato covering on the pie as it had that outer crust. In addition the mashed potato was creamy and not heavy. Regarding the meat there is a contrasting texture with the minced beef and lamb that makes the dish very appetizing. Everyone mentions about the Sticky Toffee Dessert but for dessert I ordered the Spotted \"Dic\". I liked how the warm bread pudding meshed with the cold ice cream. I would have given a higher rating had it not been for the Truffle Chips. I expected the chips to be a thick cut chip. Instead the chips were the typical skinny cut. Overall I had a good dinner Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill."

We got there pretty late so there was no wait. The waitress led us to a table that was ridiculously too small and you had to sit on stools, so there was no place to put your jacket or purse. I immediately asked her if we could be seated at a bigger table but she said that they had a limited waitstaff because they were closing in 45 minutes. OK, fine, I figured I could make it work. But no, the table was just way too small. I wish I had taken a picture of it because it was half the size of the other tables around us.\n\nOur waiter, Chris, came by and introduced himself to us. I asked him right away if there's anything he could do about our table situation. He said he would have to ask the hostess. He came back right away and said we could move to a bigger table. THANK YOU, CHRIS!!!  BTW, the area where we were seated was kinda dark but I was happy for a bigger table.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered the Shepard's Pie. He really enjoyed his but I thought it was kinda bland. It did not have much taste to it at all. I've only had Shepard's Pie once before years ago and I remembered it being flavorful. Usually we don't order the same things but for some reason on this night we did. I should have ordered the fish and chips."

The good impressions started even before we entered the place. In the first moments of walking up to the restaurant, I fell in love with their uniforms! The hostess' are outfitted in the most adorably sexy newspaper dress accessorized with fingerless leather gloves and matching booties. Someone remind me to ask our loving David S. to steal one for me ;) The uniforms only got better as the rest of the FOH people were dressed in this awesome British punk street wear. Designer Allison Leach of Mad Men and Glee did one heck of a job of creating that awesome first impression.\n \nOur server was a little too high energy for me. You know when you have that fake salesperson vibe when they're trying to sell you something? Yeah, it was a little much. But other then that our server and serving assistants were working like a well-oiled machine. My mother is a lightweight and needed a girly beer. Our server smartly suggested the strawberry Fruli... It is now her favorite beer ever. And bread service was amazing. It shows up warm and delicious with a cheddar cheese spread and whipped butter cream. Andthey don't have a problem with serving you seconds. Hands down the best bread basket in town. \n \nThe food. Oh man, the food is British pub action on point. I was itching to try some Sheperd's Pie. And although it is one of the cheapest entr\u00e9e items it was one of the most delicious non-Asian foods I've eaten in forever. Tender chunks of lamb, beef, and vegetables blanketed in mouth-watering mashed potatoes. *heaven* In the fish & chips, they used cod which was a little heavier on the breading but fried to perfection. And the chips (fries) were thick blocks of fried potato served piping hot. Instead of a salad, we ordered a side of Brussels sprouts saut\u00e9ed with bacon and apples. The slices of apple were real treats! They absorbed all the delicious flavors from the seasoning  and the sugar cooked off in the little bit of bacon fat. Amazing! I wish there were more than just 2! \n\nThe only downside to our meal was the lamb riblettes appetizer. Tiny bits of lamb were served with a creamy cumin-based yogurt sauce. It was tasty but for the price, portion size was absolutely abysmal. GR insider David S. says the lamb entr\u00e9e is the way to go and 1000x better.\n \nI'm loving GR's new diggs. It's cool but still upscale with the food & service to match. I shall return.\n \nCheers!"

There was a long wait for table, but we were able to walk right up to the bar and sit. \nI have to say, this was the way to go. The bartenders were our favorite company for the night! Antwone was hands down our favorite. Ladies, I am telling you, if you want a great view for the night, go no further. Antwone is the best view in Vegas.\nWe ordered the chicken chop salad and scotch egg to split and I thought the food was amazing. \nThe people at the bar were social and fun. The whole vibe was great.\nBut like I said above, the bartenders were really our selling point for this place. I would go back to Ceasars just to visit this Pub again....."

            "review": "Let's start off that in Caesar's Palace, there is no shortage of food options. Fine dining is as commonplace as a tourist with a spiked neon slushie in a foot-long container. That said... When we chose to eat at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, it was calculated. We were all enthusiastic to eat at this scary, yet reputable chef's restaurant.\n\nBut all went awry when 45 minutes after placing our order, our party was awaiting the APPETIZER.  And the most puzzling part was that the restaurant was damn near EMPTY at the time we ate. Where the dag nabbit was Ramsay with his inappropriate and oft mal-placed British curses and wrinkled forehead to scare the bejesus out of these chefs for a hustle on our order? 45 minutes on a meal in Vegas? You know what I missed? I missed the taxi cab that was going to take me to MGM to see Calvin Harris. Or... I might have missed the end results of the poker tournament at Rio. Or... At least 2 drinks with my cousins from out of  town.  In other words, time is money and in Vegas, time and money is currency. \n\nRamsay, you have a 3-star pub and grill. And your name brought us despite the mediocre reviews. I still have a homoerotic man-crush on you, but the service  needs a firm kick in the pants."

However, if the food was on a scale from 1 to 10 it was a 5 or 6 at best.  I understand that Gordon Ramsay is not back in the kitchen personally and I understand none of his top Chefs are back there as well.  But I was shocked that he would put his name on the mediocre food that is served there. \n\nI ordered the Onion Soup and my wife ordered the Duck Confit Poutine for our lunch starters.  The Onion soup was good, it had a different after taste but it was a good soup.  My wife was not fond of the flavor of the soup.  Her Duck Confit Poutine was tasteless and was a slightly warm glob of a mess and again it was really tasteless.  \n\nFor our main dish I had the Traditional Sheppard's Pie and she had the Pub \"Spots\" (3 mini-house blend pub burgers.)  My Sheppard's pie was ok, not great but not horrible, I was shocked that it came out of a Gordon Ramsay kitchen.  It was bland and a bit greasy, it tasted like pot roast  that was served in my elementary school which I was not a fan of.   I have had much better Sheppard's Pie at Walt Disney World's EPCOT.   My wife's the Pub \"Spots\" (3 mini-house blend pub burgers.) were ordered Med Rare and came out over well done.  The overcooked burgers were taken off the bill, not by our request but by the server who agreed that they were not cooked properly and were way over cooked.   The wait staff again was excellent and I tipped her approx 30 percent because she and the rest of the staff were excellent.   \n\nI am a big Gordon Ramsay fan and really enjoy reading his cookbooks and his television shows.  However, after the let down at Gordon Ramsay Steak and now at the Pub. \n\n I just don't think I can spend our money on a product that is supposed to be top quality in all aspects and falls short, but you never know what the future brings..  I may go back.."

We were staying at the hotel so we reviewed the menu in the room (note: the listing says casual dining but the prices are equivalent to or more than the upscale restaurants) and headed down. \n\nThe hostess told us it was a 15 minute wait so we added our name and stood around. After half an hour, I realized the hostess forgot us as she kept seating other 2 top parties right away. I told her the dilemma and she insisted she didn't forget us and that we were next. Sooo we finally got seated after 30 minutes of wasted time. Not too good of a start for dinner. \n\nOur waitress took our drink order of a soda each ($5 sodas. Yeah. That's not casual dining prices) and didn't return with our drinks for 20+minutes. So here we are thinking we were forgotten by the hostess and now by our server. \n\nWe ordered the lobster mini rolls (it comes with only 2.....not really an appetizer and more of a small bite) and the jumbo shrimp cocktail (7 shrimp if even...with large croutons stuffed between them.)\n\nThe food was actually delicious but was overshadowed by the ridiculous expense of it all. We spent equivalent to a full fledged meal for two on two drinks and two appetizers. The service was abhorrent and absolutely TERRIBLE for a high end establishment. \n\nSave yourself the time and money by not eating here. This restaurant is a flop."

The last two visits have been such a huge disappointment that I will not be coming back.\n\nThe first time I visited the menu was much more expansive, they had iPads with endless craft beer and wine selections and the food was delicious. When I came back a year later the iPads were gone, the menu items were different and there were less of them.\n\nThe food was greasy, bland, and spectacularly over priced for the quality. On my latest visit in July 2015 I ordered the short ribs, which turned out to be only one piece and boneless. Not what I expected, but at least it will taste good, right? Well actually, it didn't taste like anything at all. The meat was tender but had no flavor or sauce to help support it. The barley risotto had zero salt and was reminiscent of plain oatmeal. For a $40 plate I expected much more.\n\nI gave my review two stars because the pretzels and cheese sauce were good enough, my glass of wine came in a small carafe so it felt like a generous amount for the price and the service was ok. Not enough positives to come back again, too bad."

Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay (a bit of a crush?!), his shows on t.v. and last visit loving Gordon Ramsay Burgr, hubby made dinner reservations with Open Table and we showed up at the appointed time.  Our half booth/chair table was ready and we were sat almost immediately.\n\nThe decor and general vibe is a bit loud, a bit fun, large open area looking out into casino, with a mix of slightly different appointed areas of lighting, seating and various artwork.  The table settings were unique, including the flatware.  Service was efficient and friendly and our waiter would come back with answers to our questions without being prompted to.  \n\nAppetizer:  4 stars for English style Nachos, delicious hot freshly cooked kettle chips with a terrific sharp English cheddar, a delicious English TP sauce and corned beef bits and tender short rib.  This could have been a 5 star contender but the chef was stingy on the meats.\n\nMain Courses:  4 stars for Fish & Chips and 4 stars for Steak & Ale Pie. High end ingredients in both, tasty, tasty tasty. I opted out on the chips for chive truffle oil mashed potatoes and that was delicious.  The reason the 2 main courses didnt receive 5 stars are due to the fish batter could have been crispier and the steak & ale pie was a tad on the small size for a main course.\n\nDid you save up room in your tummy?  I hope so because below was the only true worthy five stars!\n\nDessert:  5 stars for Potted Chocolate Trifle, perfection and a must for chocoholics!

Fortunately, our server told us he could get us one from the bar area, so that made us very happy!

And since we weren't starving, we opted to share three things:  The onion soup, the burger and the infamous sticky toffee pudding.\n\n  The soup was possibly the best onion soup I've ever had...the broth was rich and delicious.  Not sure about anything that tasted like welsh cheddar rarebit though?  \n\n   Big plus on the burger, they were kind enough to split it for us, so they brought us each a plate with fries.  The burger was very tasty, had a bit of a smokey flavor.  Good, but not the best we've ever had.  Husband kept saying he thought there was another meat in it besides beef...I don't know about that, I think he was tasting bacon.  The fries were okay, but unevenly cooked.  Some were mushy, some crisp and some in between.  \n\n  The highlight was definitely the sticky toffee pudding.  Yep, it ranks right up there in sweet heaven like everyone says.\n\n  Service was also like most everyone has said.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.  We were in there for what felt like forever.

Let's break these bad boys down:\n\n1) The pretzels weren't anything ridiculously amazing, but the dijon mustard is the star.  You can tell it's fresh.  It's a coarse-ground mustard that has plenty of heat.  If you put too much, it will clear out your sinuses, but wasn't retardedly/annoyingly hot.  \n\n2) I'd have to say that the corn chowder wasn't my favorite, but it had some good flavor combinations.  The chowder was sweet and had some crab meat placed in, which made it much more sweet that I usually go for.  I'd kind of like something sour (citrus/lime juice possibly) to cut the sweetness.  But the creme fresh paired well to smooth the flavors out.  It cut into the sweetness a bit.  There was a bit of julienned basil to also help cut the sweetness.  Overall, pretty good.\n\n3) The heirloom tomato sandwich is EXCELLENT.  Crispy bread with a citrusy aoli.  Perfectly rip tomatoes with thinly shaved parmessian on top.  Awesome.  I want another one for dinner.  Sh*t, I'd eat one for breakfast.  The freshness of the tomatoes work perfectly for a hot day.  And it was light enough not to weigh me doswn, unlike a shepherd's pie or a flat iron steak+fixin's.  No post-lunch naps required...\n\nAll in all, good execution and a great place to take someone to, since you'll be able to have good conversation about the decor, ipad drink menu, and presentation."

From the hostesses to the waiter to the wine and menu selections.  The food was FANTASTIC, and might be the best food I've eaten in Vegas. I got the roasted cauliflower soup and the mixed grill of filet, bacon wrapped prawns and lamb ribs. The sides of brussels sprouts and english pub fries were equally amazing!  Everything was out of the world!!  I'll be going back for sure. Check this \"pub\" out!!"

I expected more from a Gordon ramsay restaurant seeing how they put him on TV and shit. Now i know why he's pissed all the time, it's all shitty. How do you not provide spoons when customers order soup? The rice was stale. The steak was very bitter. The clam chowder is good, but i think i like progresso better.

After a few minutes the bartender just started wiping glasses. We were pretty irritated and got up, the bartender noticed and said he forgot and apologized. He put in the order and brought our drinks. We waited for about 20 minutes and our bartender disappeared. I needed a refill on my beer but we couldn't get anyone's attention even though we were sitting front and center in the bar area. \n\nThere was one bartender who was glued to the television watching the soccer game. We were finally fed up once and for all. I reminded the bartender that he wasn't sitting in his apartment watching TV and to bring my bill (for 1 beer). Also canceled the burger. What's even sadder is that the bar seating around us was empty and a complete mess. On a better note the pizza in the food court next door was quick and delicious. Overall, Ramsey shouldn't act like he has such high standards and rip apart restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares then have his name on a place like this. Too much expansion to create restaurants for contestants to work at from Hells Kitchen without proper training."

Upon receiving our meal half the orders had been sitting under the heat lamp so long they felt like they had been prepared yesterday.  We received some replacement \"chips\" for our Fish N' Chips which were warm but completely uncooked in the center.  The staff offered little assistance and was completely absent.

This was just a few feet from there so we decided to try it out since we just ate at Gordon Ramsay's Steak the night before and loved it. The service was great here and the appetizer was delicious (ordered the calamari). For entrees I ordered the bangers and mash and he ordered the fish and chips. Both were the house specials. They were good, nothing special at all though. I've tasted way better fish and chips in SB, SF, Pismo, etc and they weren't $30 like these ones. $30 was a bit ridiculous for fish and chips, but we thought Gordon Ramsay so it must be good. And there was a fish bone in it! Yeah, nothing special at all and portion was so small. My bangers and mash was good, but again, nothing special. I could make something that tasted like that at home for so much cheaper. The dish was $24. Not worth. Aside from that, it took 45 minutes to receive our food. The people next to us who came after us and ordered the fish and chips too got their food like 15 minutes before us. Only thing that was worth was the appetizer. Calamari tasted like bacon. It was delicious. Despite the prices, the server was excellent. I forgot his name but he was attentive. And gave us free sticky toffee bread pudding with ice cream for free for my bf's birthday. It was one of the best desserts I've ever tasted and I'd pay full price for it. Overall, not worth the price. With how much we spent individually we could've just ate at bacchanal and ate as much as we want with many options."

Just a note - we looked on the Caesar's website in detail at all of their restaurants to find one that wasn't too overpriced since we had a big weekend of eating at nice places in front of us.  I didn't even know Gordon Ramsay had a place in Caesar's, but to my delight, there it was on the list and it had two $$ in front of it, noting it as an average check price of $20 per person.  This was not the case.  An average cost for an entree appears to be about $28.\n\nSo I met up with my friends and ordered a dirty martini, which came out perfect.  We ordered our food and started chatting.  We noticed that 30 minutes had gone by and the waiter had not come back and our food had not arrived.  We waved him down and he said he would go check on it.  10 minutes later the food finally came out.  I had ordered the duck confit salad from the appetizer section.  The portion was almost an entree portion, but half the price!  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I finished the entire plate and was just full enough.  One of my friends ordered the roasted chicken, which looked like a tiny whole roasted chicken.  I didn't try any of it but he said it was great.  My other friend ordered the flank steak medium, and it came out medium rare.  She also said it was quite delicious.  We ordered the fingerling potatoes as a side, and those were BOMBtastic.  To my surprise, the side of brussel sprouts were okay (i HATE brussel sprouts).\n\nThe ambiance was classy, but not stuffy.  I liked it a lot.  It was fun and just the right amount of loud.  The service was fine, other than the food taking forever, but maybe that's just because it's so new they are still trying to work out all the kinks.  It's also a huge plus my duck confit was only $16 and was such a big portion.  I'd go here again and try the fish and chips.  I saw a couple of waiters carrying that by for another table and my mouth began to water.  They looked phenomenal!"

Theirs is served with duck confit, brown gravy, just a little cheese, all on top of thin-cut fries.  It was rich and salty but also fabulous.  I would have licked the bowl if no one else was around.\n\nMy husband and daughter ordered different versions of their burger, and both loved them.  We also got a side of Brussels Sprouts.  These were very smoky and a bit overcooked, but otherwise okay.\n\nThey have this funny gimmick where your server hands you an iPad so you can view the drink menu.  There are buttons you can tap to place a drink order, only they don't actually work.  Turns out, the order isn't really placed via the iPad; you still have to order your drinks from your server.  Seems like a waste of time and technology to me.\n\nI feel bad for the staff here.  The uniforms are pretty awful.  The men wear outfits that are sort of 1850s-bartender-meets-punk-rocker.  The hostesses wear tight tank dresses in a tacky newsprint pattern.\n\nStill, it's more about the food than anything else, and the food here was very good.

Bacchanal had a nearly 90 minute wait for a $53 brunch and we were denied at Mesa Grill because they had a dress code for lunch (screw you Flay). Our fallback was the more casual Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.\n\nAnything with Ramsay's namesake should scream quality and consistency, but most of the plates fell short of expectations. We started off with the little piggy deviled eggs, which were presented with the yolk separated for self-serving. From there, I went with the shepherd's pie, which came lukewarm. The mashed potatoes had an unpleasant texture and I didn't get much of the cheddar cheese. The ground lamb and peas had no distinguishing flavor. The steak & ale pot pie came off as salty, but at least I enjoyed the crust. \n\nThe sides we tried included the truffle fries and the lobster mac & cheese. The fries were far too similar to the regular fries and didn't have enough truffle oil. The lobster mac & cheese was worse than the Kraft blue box. While there was a generous helping of lobster meat, the mac & cheese itself was very watery and no crispy crust. We declined the popular sticky toffee pudding for next time.\n\nOur waitress was great and sold us on their imported beer menu. Her entertaining small talk was probably the highlight of our meal."

He did an immediate \"exit stage right\" to a hallway. A manager came to our table as the waiter exited the room. He apologized and offered a different meal. Well to make a long story short, dinner wasn't the same. Out of their kindness, her meal was removed from the bill. Our server never once apologized!  GORDON, if you run your life criticizing people, get your property's in order first. SO DISAPPOINTED!! By the way, I gave 2 stars just because the manager noticed and my fish was good. Sorry I don't remember the servers name, but he was a 40's grey haired medium built man."

I followed up by asking if the bar was open, to which I got a condescending response of yes. Finally the manager came over, to which I asked why I have to be the one who has to inquire on the bar being open seating. The manager gave me lip service so I decided this establishment was not worth my money. As I walked away, the hostesses continued to laugh. I would recommend staying away from somewhere that has zero customer service and clearly doesn't appreciate their clientele. In the end, I strolled over to Spago just a couple steps away and it was well worth the walk. Do yourself a favor - go to Spago :)"

Poorly handled phone res and directions. As locals we hadn't been here and hosted my brother and friend, party of 4 plus child. The waiter was nice, simple in his approach, friendly, etc. but I hate it when the have deliver/expediter servers that come and drop off food without really knowing who has what, no sense for service, unfriendly and unengaging and close to being rude. Both food delivery people-a guy for our apps and a lady for the salads were basically rude. Uninterested in serving, embarrassing for the fact that the restaurant was barely busy. I feel\nBad for being their table tonight. The waiter did provide some nice choices for my wife and I to dine locally as we just moved here which, was above and beyond, and for that he earned his 18% tip. The lighting went high to low twice during dinner. Amateur hour? I personally question the pricing on the beers and the wines too. I'm in F&B consultancy/marketing with large corporate accounts and my take here is their beer pricing is too high. Ok, expensive to be expensive- I get that, it's Vegas tourism, but portion sizes should be questioned too. I had the Kale and Bacon Shepherds Pie. Mistake. Ok to Good-yes, small-oh yes!!! It was a French onion soup size bowl filled half way with a puff pastry on top. Are you kidding? I don't even want to know what that cost me! 300 bucks later, left hungry. Thank goodness for wives that leave portions for their husbands to eat. Won't recommend."

For dinner... I would suggest spending your money somewhere else.\n\nI loved the atmosphere and the bartenders all had sexy Irish accents, so that was a nice touch.

Mainly, because one person in our party ordered the mussels and at least half a dozen hadn't opened.  Anyone who knows anything about seafood should know that un-opened mussels usually means they're no good and a good chef should never let those out of the kitchen.  When we pointed that out to the server, we just got a shrug of the shoulders. Umm... ok?!\n\nHonestly, I can't even remember what I ordered, so it wasn't that memorable.

Give me really good food with a really good beer spin that around with some really helpful service, and we are talking.  The secret to getting the best experience here is asking your server what are the specials and recommendations.  On multiple occasions, the server led me onto a tasty new adventure.  One of their highly recommended beers is the Scottish Innis and Gunn.  The server recommended this very crisp and refreshing ale to me.  It has become the centerpiece of what I am basing my dinner on.  Do not be afraid to ask them what they would pair your food with.  My servers on the occasions I have gone here, really sold the food choices by their descriptions.\nOne evening, I tried the Shepard's Pie.  Very flavorful, very moist.  It is lamb based, rather than ground beef.  The potatoes on top were just so soft and melted in my mouth.\nAnother one to try is the bacon cheeseburger.  Sounds simple enough, but that bacon is maple bacon...  The server told me that the bacon starts the day before.  It is cut up then soaked overnight in pure maple syrup.  It is then cooked with more syrup. I am telling you this right now, IT IS GOOD.  It is gooder than good. The chef that afternoon even came out to check on some tables.  I told him right there, \"Best thing I ever put in my mouth.\"\nService was top notch.  Friendly, knowledgable servers that know the menu and the beers available.

The quality of food rarely ever meets the expectation that comes with the famous talking head promoting it. Gordon Ramsay demands quality on screens worldwide, but when it comes to his restaurants you get what you pay for. High quality does necessarily not trickle down from the mega-bucks eateries these celebrity chefs own.  \n\nAfter a decent wait - because these hot spots are always packed - my gf & I took a seat in the back. We were here at an odd hour late in the day, so we decided to just get a couple drinks and split some appetizers. That \"couple of drinks\" became one when we checked the menu and noticed each signature cocktail was $15 a pop. Now, yes, I know I could've just had something else but where's the fun in that? Still, there's no way in hell I'm going to try getting drunk on $15 drinks. I ordered a Pub Crawl, which was bourbon whiskey with ginger liqueur, lemon, and mint & black tea syrup. Tasted great, would've loved a few more... but not at that price. \n\nFor the apps, we decided on a Scotch egg and the pot pie sampler, which included mini versions of their steak, chicken, and shepherd's pie. \n\nThe Scotch egg was killer. I've had this exactly twice before in my life - the first time was very good, the second time it was two burnt lumps of sausage surrounding a medium-boiled egg. This blew both of those away. I would assume if they can make a Scotch egg great anywhere, it's going to be here. \n\nNow, the pot pie sampler shows up and it's tiny. Really tiny. Tyrion Lannister's little mitts would make these pies look small, and in my hands they looked like silver dollars. At $24 (which is $8/each), you'd think the serving size would be double. Too bad, because the steak pie was delicious. Chicken pot pie is chicken pot pie, and this tasted like any other chicken pot pie. But the shepherd's pie was kinda rank. It smelled like dirty gym socks and didn't taste much better. WTF? I've had great shepherd's pie before and this was not even close. Lame. \n\nWe grabbed the bill at this point and - HOLY SHIT - $72 and I'm not even full or drunk?!? I don't even have a mild buzz, and I'm already asking my gf where to eat next. If you feel like blowing twice that, go for dinner. Me, I'd rather fill up somewhere else just as good; a place that won't charge me for a fancy name."

So naturally, I would want to try out one of his restaurants. This place happened to be a 30 second walk from the Colosseum, as I was going to see Celine Dion afterwards. So, my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. It's definitely pricier than BurGR over at Planet Holleywood, but not as expensive as Steak. \n\nI would consider myself lucky after reading some reviews that wait time to be seated and for food to come out can be upwards of 60+ minutes. We did not have a reservation for that Friday night at 6 PM, but luckily the wait was just around 25 minutes. It took about 15-25 minutes for our food to come out. I was expecting much longer than that. The couple that sat down next to us waited much longer, though. It was probably about 30-40 minutes. We kept hearing them say \"Why is it taking so long? What's with this hold up? *checks watch every 10 minutes*\n\nThe menu here is quite expensive for dishes that seem so simple to make. Lobster mac n' cheese for $25? Yikes. Yes, lobster is expensive, but honestly, I can probably make triple the amount for double the price. \n\n[[Chicken, Kale & Bacon Pot Pie, $23]] For $23, I would expect a huge pot pie. Nope. It came out in this small bowl. I finished the thing in 10 minutes... It was good, yes, but nothing amazing or mind blowing.\n\n[[Grilled Lamb Burger, $21]] My boyfriend ordered this, and he thought it was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The burger came with fries on the side, but $21 isn't worth it.  \n\n[[Truffle Chips, $12]] Basically some fries with truffle oil and a sprinkle of cheese on it. The fries itself wasn't too memorable, but the sauce it came with on the side was delicious. \n\nService here is pretty good; our server was attentive and asked us every so often how everything was going. \n\nWould I dine here again? No. Prices are a tad outrageous (obviously, since it's Vegas, but c'mon now). Even if I was filthy rich I wouldn't. You're just not getting bang for your buck by eating here.

We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.\n\nWe didn't have to wait to long to get in (30 minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand).  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu (as we were about to find out).  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois (something we could justify spending $10 on) but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.\n\nI ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links (made in-house) but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about 3-4 minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server (she has professional kitchen and culinary training), he said \"yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente\", and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.\n\nI had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about 15 minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been 86'd from the menu but they were making some more \"downstairs\".  My wife (a former employee of Caesars/Harrahs) asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsay's recipes or they might not be (it wasn't clear to us), but the fact that they were being mass-produced in the downstairs bakery rather than in-house upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesar's (they make some delicious pastry), but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After 15 more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb (a different kind of rhubarb at that) mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddish-purple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasn't a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mix-up, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.  I mean, enough already.  It was peach.  End of story.  \n\nLong story short we wanted to like the place, but were disappointed and slightly offended that they kind of thought we were dum-dums in the great rhubarb/peach debate.  Good thing Gordon Ramsay has a good burger place in town to fall back on."

We got there probably 5 mins late due to not being all to cross the street in Vegas (damn escalators everywhere.) When we walked up to the hostess she asked for reservation and said that everything was fine/table was still available. Sat down, greeted by a very nice waiter, made small talk, oversell good enough guy! As an appetizer we shared an order of truffle fries and the were excellent, seasoned very well/ not over powered by the truffle oil like most places do. On to the entrees: GF- Lobster/shrimp roll - she loved it, roll was nice, not soggy at all, Lobster was perfect. Mine- pulled pork sandwich - the bread was VERY greasy which I wasn't expecting, the pork was slightly dry, apple slaw was nice.  Overall , I believe 3 stars is fair. I would still like to try BrGR and Gordon Ramsey Steak! Black jacket? Wonder if Chef Scott was running the pass or Latasha(oh)"

They were bland and so was the chicken breast...no seasoning at all.  We could only eat half of our meals because of the bland taste.

Looks like a trendy new spot to stop by and hang out by the bar, or give a go at authentic British cuisine. \n\nAnd we're done with the good. Now let's go into why I felt like I wasted a perfect meal-time (i hate it when that happens...) at Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant.\n\nI literally ate like a rabbit all day just to save my stomach for Gordon Ramsay's. I mean, it's GORDON RAMSAY. The chef who is so angry and critical all the time, that I feel like his restaurant HAS to be good. I was so hungry that any mediocre dish (even fast food) could probably satisfy me, but Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill wasn't even close. For someone who markets himself as being a perfectionist in the kitchen, it certainly does not seem he has met his own standards. \n\nI started with the Fried Oysters appetizer. The dish was presented with three oyster shells with two tiny fried bits in each. I literally felt like I was just eating batter. Wasn't much flavoring to it and wasn't anything special. \n\nI followed it with the fish and chips. It wasn't terrible, but I feel like I could've probably found the same level of satisfaction at Long John Silver's. I would honestly rather make a stop at Long John's than pay $26 for that plate again. My date ordered the Braised Pork Belly ($30) and looked like it would be promising, but again, it was rather bland. You can definitely find a much better prepared pork belly elsewhere. \n\nThe most exciting part was probably the pretzels as the form of complimentary bread. It was offered with butter and a type of cheese-mustard. I've heard good things about the pudding dessert and that's probably the only thing that would ever weigh my consideration on returning.\n\nMy bill ended up being $100, 1 appetizer, 2 main course dishes, and 1 glass of Hennesey. Sadly, I would've been much happier spending that $100 at the Bacchanal Buffet."

Besides the wonderful food (try the hanger steak!), the service is top notch! Even though it's in the middle of a casino and can get crowded, the staff is what one would expect when eating at such a famous chef's restaurant. The waitress knew the menu, made wonderful recommendations, and catered to our every need. We started off with the Butternut Squash soup with herb butter (rich!), after I ordered the Traditional Shepard's Pie, made with beef and lamb. It's wonderful topping of whipped mashed potatoes browned to perfection is to die for! My husband ordered the hanger steak, and he offered me a few bites. So tender! Finally, we devoured the sticky, toffee pudding! I can't say enough about our waitress, or the table attendant. So friendly and always asking if we needed anything, and when dinner was served, she came straight by to make sure we were happy!  Awesome job!!  I nearly nicked Ramsay a star for a lady walking around taking souvenir pictures. She had a rattling loud gab fest at the table next to us in a restaurant that has to modify noise levels anyways. She stayed too long chatting it up at this table.  I don't think we need souvenir photographers in a world with Iphones. There was also a very large pool of water in the hallway in the kitchen area that I could see from the restrooms, and it was alarming they'd allow that to be tracked around. My paper menu was soiled as well.  Other than that, we'll be back!"

I had never had fish and chips that good before!\n\nAfter today, though, I don't know where I'd get those fish and chips again :( I went in today not knowing that just about 4 weeks ago, they changed the menu around and some of the recipes (I asked the waiters/waitresses about it). The fish, which before were perfectly sized, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, was now giant, thick slabs that were dry and overcooked. The batter, which used to be crispy but flaky to the touch, were now thick and hard. The fries, which used to be thick but crunchy, were now dry and burnt-tasting.\n\nI did have other dishes, but nothing that was better than average. The majority of the dishes I ordered last time were no longer on the menu after the menu change, so nothing to compare (those other dishes were GREAT the first time I visited, though!).\n\nThe waiters/waitresses were quite nice though. To be fair, the place probably deserves a 2/5 stars now, but after that overwhelmingly disappointing decision to change the recipes and menu so drastically, I had to give this 1/5...I'm so sad."

I had to choose between rounding down to 3 or up to 4 but I used my city-judging tie breaker and gave them a 4.\n\nI've had my heart set on coming here for a while.  Then I started reading the recent reviews and few had something positive to say. However, I really wanted to judge for myself and give a fair assessment. \n\nAll thing a considered during the experience, here is how I landed at 3:\n\n- Upon arriving, greeted by 3 possibly unhappy hostesses? 0 smiles given and a very bland \"enjoy your meal\" after seating us.  \n\n- Hospitality - 0 points - It's non-existent from the entire staff, which I would be making a much bigger deal out of if not for the fact that this is A: A Gordon Ramsay Establishment and well, hospitality isn't his M.O. and B: It's still Vegas where money and beauty trump all other things.  \n\nFood - We didn't eat anything bad.  But only the Chicken, Kale and Bacon pot pie stood out as a \"wow\" item.  Portions are small and it's kind of ridiculous when you consider the cuisine.  I'll pay $12 for truffle fries but you should be able to share them, not ration out a few fries to a table of 4.  Last I checked a 50 pound bag of potatoes was still $11.\n\nPrices - this goes against everything I believe in but I'm going to go ahead and complain about it.  $30 for Fish N Chips Gordon? No one at the table even ordered them and I'm pissed off about this.  Again, noting that the portion on it is barely enough to feed 1 person and you're using Cod, not an expensive fish.  \n\nService - not to be confused with hospitality, which there was none of....they do the job they need to do.  Water was always full, appetizers and entrees came out quickly, no mistakes on the orders.  Our server made no attempt to enhance the experience though.  Made no suggestions, didn't offer dessert which is a shame since I had already picked out what I would have 2 weeks prior and was pretty excited.  \n\nAtmosphere - It's a beautiful pub and very swanky.  Being located in Caesars Palace kind of makes that a requirement.\n\nThere are certainly a hundred much better options on the Strip but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try this place.  Just taper your expectations and be willing to overpay for what you get."

The Shepherd's pie, which is made correctly with lamb and not beef, was tasty and comforting.  The curry chicken was larger than expected and had a good little kick of curry spice.

Ambience was crowded and noisy, not what we were hoping for but understandable due to location (open walls inside Caesar's palace) and the pub theme. Service was friendly and prompt. We ordered chicken kale and bacon pot pie and the kettle nachos. The nachos were delicious. Thick, crispy potato chips with an English cheddar cheese sauce, braised beef and sweet peppers. They're were surprisingly filling, but there were only peppers and meat on the top, not layered it's the chips. Since we got them during happy hour, the price was reasonable for what we received, but we would have felt robbed if we'd paid full price. The pot pie was under seasoned, and there was no salt or pepper at the table. The waitress came to ask if we wanted any halfway through the meal. The bacon pieces in it were fatty and limp, the crust was soggy, and there were maybe 5 pieces of kale in the whole thing. Portion was small by American standards, which was what I expected and would have been fine except that it didn't come with any sides. Odd for a dinner entree, and really ridiculous for the $24 price. To cap it off, I informed the waitress that we were celebrating my husbands birthday at the start of the meal, and other than a \"oh happy birthday!\" nothing was done. Maybe it's just the restaurant policy, but really, would it break the bank to bring out a scoop of ice cream or something? Overall the meal and experience were a huge let down."

Let me start by saying that the quality of the food was very good, and truly that should be the important part right? The service however...ugh.\nHusband and I came in Xmas Eve, dressed to the nines as we were going to a show that night...the hostess put us on a tiny crappy table stuck by a beverage cart and then she walked away without asking if it was ok...I don't like to make waves on a busy service night, so I didn't complain, but we had a reservation made over 10 days previous and it would have been nice to have a decent table when we were obviously dressed for a nice dinner.  Our server was then clueless to anything.  He was slow, did not have a good knowledge of the menu, and was not genuine in his approach to our questions.  When he asked us for our drink order  we were very specific in what we wanted.  I specifically asked him if he had a particular liquor,& I overhead him ask his co-worker about it,  and we could tell they had no idea. He then placed the order..?  Out of concern I then walked the 10 paces to the bar and found out myself that indeed they did NOT have what I wanted.  Low and behold, my drink arrives. The server tried to pawn off a drink as the one that I wanted....Furious. If someone is going to take initiative and ask me to try a drink in place of one that I want, I'm ok with that....However, to pretend to give me what I want, and pretend knowing otherwise angers me. These drinks are $20 bucks a piece, so I am pissed at this point and so is my husband.\nBartender to the rescue...I walk up there a second time and he looks sheepish. He knows already that the drink he made came to me after knowing full well that I did not want what was obviously given to me. He offered to look in the backroom for a replacement and ended up getting me exactly what I wanted from somewhere else.\n\nFood: we had the mini trio of pot pies for appetizer, delicious, came out quick, but a little pricey for what you get. Prime rib entr\u00e9e also very good, nice cut, well cooked. Caesar salad, simply delicious, homemade dressing with anchovies, yum! Grilled lamb burger on the brioche bun, soooo good, I loved it!  \nIts so sad that an experience like we had could overshadow really good food. The food is served well, its creative, eye appealing and tastes great. The service is poor, the hostess stand awful,  stacked with 2-3 girls who don't use any common sense,  and are phony to greet but yet don't even notice as you leave after spending $250.  It all left a bad taste in our mouths.  This is vegas, and there are so many restaurants to choose from...We will not be back.  Well, maybe we will sit at the bar :)"

I should know better than to order a steak that is not prime grade.  But nonetheless, it was satisfying.  Nothing special by any means.  The menu is definitely tilted towards an English influence which should be no surprise.  I just wish I would have gotten a burger.  The staff was all very attentive, friendly, and full of interesting characters.  I would definitely go back to eat here.  I would just stick to what the name implies they are best at.  Pub and grill food!"

The waitress was friendly and attentive and the food was incredible. However, my visit yesterday was mediocre at best. We had to ask twice to get out free pretzel/bread basket and it wasn't delivered until well after we received our entrees. Also, the food was not all delivered at the same time. I ordered the fish and chips, which you would think was the fastest to make (compared to the lamb and sliders), but I had to wait three or four minutes for my dish after the others were delivered. There were no complaints about the food, but we felt neglected.\n\nTips:\n- Make sure to make reservations on Open Table before hand\n- If you have Total Rewards make sure to check the TR prices are charged on your bill. Both times I visited full price was charged. They also don't accept Ceasers TR F&B vouchers.\n- I made the mistake of taking my parents here. The music was very loud, which I don't mind. However, it was difficult for my older parents to hear.\n- As with most upscale restaurants, unless specified (eg Fish and Chips), the entrees don't include any sides. You have to order them separately."

I think when a celebrity chef puts their name on a restaurant, we assume that it should be spectacular but that isn't always the case.  We came by for dinner since the other half is a big fan of Chef Ramsay.  He watches Hell's Kitchen religiously, while I can barely tolerate all the yelling and drama.  I will say that I do like to watch his show Junior Master Chef though...but I digress.  As expected, the place was packed.  Especially since it is located across from the Colosseum, many people (myself included) wanted to eat dinner there before the Mariah Carey concert.  We arrived and were told it would be about a 20 min wait.  That worked out fine and we were seated inside for a table of two.  The ambiance is very pub-like with and I imagine there are actually some pubs like this in England.  Our waiter was just so-so.  We told him that we were in a hurry bc we were going to the concert after dinner.  He didn't really seem to care much and it took longer than expected to get our food.  25 minutes later, our salad and burger finally arrive.    \n\nThe two items we ordered were just average and we could have gotten the same level of food at any bar and grill:\n-Pub Chopped Salad ($16):  I will admit that the salad was very fresh and they did give a lot of shrimp and grilled chicken.  The salad also contained ham, sliced apples, chickpeas, cherry tomatoes, white cheddar and pretzel crisps (their version of croutons).  It was supposed to have avocado too but I only found 2 small chunks.  The pretzel crisps was a nice touch which I liked. \n-Grilled Beef Burger ($19):  Huge disappointment.  The beef patty was dry and unseasoned.  The only toppings on the burger were two slices of white cheddar.  There wasn't any lettuce or tomato so it made the burger completely lackluster.  A small side of fries accompanied the burger.  Presentation was nice as it came out on a chopping board but that's as far as it goes. \nTotal tab was $43.  Overall, not worth the hype or anticipation.  You could get a better burger at so many other places and probably for half the price.  The other half said that even Habit Burger was better."

There was no effort to make an appetizing option. Yard house offers a full vegan menu so to be charged 28$ for nothing less then a half assed attempt to say they have a \"veg friendly\" option was sad and disappointing.

There was some waitress well in her late 30s, early 40s wearing the trashiest little number ever! And trust me, it was definitely not age appropriate.

We go to Vegas every month been trying to decide between his steakhouse, burger or pub. We figured we would do the in between so went with the pub. Just went Dec. 23rd so it wasnt crowded at all. Got seated immediately. First up the tables r too low seats very  uncomfortable. Our waitress took forever just to come over and take our drink order which was just 2 sodas. Very small menu so that made our choices pretty easy. Now mind u its 7:30pm i havent eaten since breakfast bcuz i wanted to make sure i would b able to eat my meal and end it with a great dessert.\n\nMe: Had to go with the fish & chips of course bcuz thats all Gordon talks about, with a very heavy heart i must say i was not I'm\npressed a matter of fact i was disappointed none of the dishes were flavorful. The only difference btween this fish & chips and HSalt fish & chips was it wasnt as greasy.Thank God they give u such big potatoe slices bcuz the fish pieces were small.\n\nMy daughter: shepards pie n this tiny bowl, which she had to salt and pepper, but she did love it.\n\nMy other daughter: braised lamb shank: shallow\n bowl/plate the lamb was very tender. \n\nMaybe if the meals came with a soup or salad or if they had some bread or something on the table u wouldnt realize how long it takes the food to come out. Once again we do splurge every few months on a fancy place and i dont mind if the total experience makes me say i cant wait to come back here, that didnt happen.This meal set us back $105.00 and just was very average. We went to the Chocolate Box and had some delicious dessert.\n\nNow, i wont b back here to eat but i will at least try his other spots."

For our last night in Vegas we decided to try here.\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait we were seated and ordered from our lovely server Jennifer. We ordered the mini burgers (6/10) and lollipop chicken for starters. They both came out super quick (within a few minutes) and while the burgers were ok the bone on my chicken was a bit cold which was strange.. I should have taken that as a hint as I bit into my chicken and realised it had a bloody raw taste and when i spat it out.. I looked down to discover that it was indeed raw.. My poor partner had eaten 3 pieces and thought they tasted weird but did not want to spit them out and after looking over at my raw chicken leg, he really wished he had..\n\nAnother server brought our mains over in record time also and we showed him the raw chicken for which he was immediately apologetic and said he would speak to the chef and manager.\n\nOur mains we had the New York Strip Steak (7/10) and the Lamb stew shepherds pie. (7/10) Both were good but it was quite difficult to truly enjoy our meals after being so worried eating raw chicken.. I could not wash that taste out of mouth no matter how many gulps of red wine I had! \n\nThe server returned to inform us that the chicken would be removed from our bill (I think this is the least they could do because most likely.. We will both be sick on our 14 hour flight back to australia) and apologised once again.\n\nDessert was the sticky toffee pudding (8/10) and the salted caramel sundae (8/10). Both were delicious.\n\nUnfortunately it was pretty difficult to recover from serving us raw chicken lollipops. The both of us including 2 pints of cider and a 250ml Pinot noir was $140 plus tips. \n\nSo will we be coming back? No.. That's a 2/2 fail rate for Gordon Ramsay's restaurant... Such a shame."

Some of the food were pretty good, I'd give that 3 stars, our server was awesome - I give her 5 stars, everybody and everything  else 0 stars... \n\nFirst of all, we went at 5:45 to get a table for 3 - with lots of empty tables in the restaurant they tell us, they can't accommodate us until 9:45 that night. We weren't that hungry so we decided to take the 9:45 reservation. When we got there again, we had to wait to be seated because it seemed like they didn't even know which tables were available. \n\nWe finally got seated at approximately 10:15 and the hostess gave us ONE menu for a party of three. Okay, you might be busy and ran out of menus for the moment, but you should give us two additional menus ASAP. She never came back, and every other party around us had a menu for per person in their party. My friend saw a hostess with extra menus in her hands so she flagged her down to give us the menus. She had the nerve to say, \"I'm sorry, we usually only give ONE MENU PER TABLE.\" - really?! That's a ridiculous excuse...if you can't think of something better, just say sorry and hide behind the counter or something. Oh yeah they ran out of water as they were filling our glasses so one of them was half full and they never came back to give us more...\n\nWe finally placed our order probably at 10:30. We ordered pub crisps (pretty good, might be a little too oily), mini sliders (I tried one that was overcooked, the meat was so dry), duck confit poutine (best dish of the night), a burger, and fish and chips (if I had read the review that all fish dishes were crap, I wouldn't have ordered this) and two drinks. During the 1+ hour that we were waiting for our food, we decided to order desserts ahead of time because we were afraid that would take another hour. We ordered the sticky toffee pudding and triple chocolate trifle - both were very good. We also got the peanut butter and jelly but that was too sweet for our taste buds. \n\nWe ordered at the same time as this table of two girls that the bald manager guy snuck in after we were seated. But their food and drinks came way earlier than ours. \n\nWe finally got our drinks at 10:45 and we didn't get any of our food until 11:44. That's over an hour after we placed our order, and people who were seated after us got their food, one table even paid and left already. Our food didn't even come in the order that the food should arrive, we got appetizers and entrees at the same time. At least they didn't bring us the dessert too. \n\nA different manager came with the people serving our food. My friend just started to complain about the poor service that we had all night. (Aside from our server - we didn't quite catch her name but she acknowledged us, she keeps coming back to tell us she had already asked the kitchen to hurry up and get us our food; she was very attentive and nice to us while we were waiting.) So the manager was apologizing, saying sorry that we had such a bad experience, yada yada ya. And they ended up giving us a free meal. \n\nIf we had to pay, I would say the food is slightly overpriced. Portions are small but depending on what you order, the food was pretty good. (DON'T ORDER FISH!!) Unless they fix how they run the restaurant (kitchen and everybody else minus that one server), I wouldn't come back...even if I loved the duck confit poutine, sticky toffee pudding and the potted triple chocolate trifle -_- But they just opened recently, so I might give it one more try (after careful screening of fellow yelp reviewers comments) in the future or if it is still around...\n\nThey have pretty judgmental people working there, if you want better, quicker service, then dress up. There was this other table near us, they received the same kind of crap service when it came to food, drinks, and all. They had to wait just as long as we did, if not longer. And they messed up their order on food too."

We watched as arriving diners were told there was a wait for a table even though the tables near us never filled up. While we waited for our food we asked a waitress why we were told the wait was 30 min when there were so many empty tables that didn't fill up while we were there. \nShe said they (not sure who that is) tries to \"stagger\" the diners so the kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed. She said she hates it because she doesn't make any money off empty tables. I told her I had a hard time believing a decision like that is left to two very young girls pretending to be hostesses and that a kitchen in Vegas run by a world famous chef can't handle a full dining room. CRAZY!\nGordon! Don't be a donkey! If you're going to put your name on a restaurant make sure it embodies your customer satisfaction philosophy. Judging by the reviews this place is not doing that. \nBTW The food was just \"ok\"."

My friend and I thankfully made a reservation for the pretty crowded restaurant and were seated almost immediately.  We were seated in the bar section which was fine, but the seating was unusual - I felt like the seats weren't tall enough for the table.\n\nAside from that the fish and chips entree was stellar!  I think that possibly the best cooked fish and chips I've ever had.  The batter was light and tasty, perfectly salted and the cod that lay beneath was wonderful.  The tartar sauce was also lovely with the fish.  I couldn't have been happier with my dish.  My friend was a little less satisfied with his meal of the steak and ale pie.  His biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough of it.  I'll agree that the pie was pretty small for the price - but other than that he enjoyed the flavour of the dish.\n\nPerhaps people might be surprised that I rated it a 4/5 but the food was in fact very good.  The service was nice and we enjoyed the experience.  It was a treat to go and I'm happy that we did."

She was friendly and efficient, and correct on the recommendation. Both items, while simple, were done to perfection. The chips were about a third of a potato or more each, and you got eight, so quite a bit of potato. They were crispy on the outside and just right on the inside. The house made ketchup was good enough to eat without putting it on the chips. It was my first scotch egg, so I don't have much to compare, but I enjoyed the contrast of the spicy sausage, egg, and slightly molten yoke. yum!"

I had the English Ale Onion Soup, which I liked, but thought it lacked.  The onions were gorgeous, the cheddar crustinis were good, but the broth didn't have it.  My main was the filet platter.

I read some reviews that said that they staggered seating. I didn't see this happen. The tables that were empty for a bit seemed to be for larger parties with reservations. We also didn't have a long wait for our food. Waiting time, all around, was average. \n\nMy husband had the lamb shank and I had the lamb rack. Both were delicious. The lamb rack comes with a couscous that is to die for. The sides not listed with your dinner come at extra cost. We ordered the mac and cheese, which was the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. To be fair, the sides probably come at an extra cost because you don't need rhem. We both would have been full and satisfied with just our meals. Our helpings were pretty large. We struggled to finish the extra side. \n\nAs a side note, I ordered my lamb rack medium and it came almost well done. This didn't bother me at all, since the only reason I didn't order it well is that we'll usually translates to burnt at most places. So I was perfectly satisfied with what I was served. \n\nThere is a photographer that will ask if you want your picture taken at dinner. She comes around about 20 minutes later to show you the picture. You get three and a frame for like $18. She also stated that she worked for ceasears and does this at all of the restaurants and attractions within the hotel. So, no matter where you go in ceasears it seems this will happen. You can always say no and she will leave. She in no way pressured us into getting or buying our pictures. \n\nWe also ended with dessert, because we were waiting for our pictured. We ate the pear cobbler, which was warm and gooey. It came with a sweat cream which evened out the dish very well. \n\nThe only complaint I have about the night was that the chairs (not the stools) are pretty low compared to the tablw. I felt like a toddler trying to reach everything, no matter how close I got to the table. \n\nOther than that, great and interesting place! Would definitely eat here again if I was given the choice!"

While all the restaurants at Cesars Palace were fully booked as expected (even the food court line was up the wall), we were seated within 10 minutes at this restaurant. They were also extremely busy yet they were able to accommodate a family of 6 at the peak of their dinner time which was 7:30 pm. We were never rushed, server was very knowledgable of the menu and specials, our water was refilled constantly, and when they made a mistake with the way one of the burgers were cooked, they replaced it within minutes. They even gave complimentary truffle fries. \n\nNow for the calamari, it is by far the best I have ever had! And I've had a ton in my lifetime.  It was so tender and fried to perfection! Great portions too. I would come back over and over just to have it. We could've had a lousy take out or room service for our New Year's Eve dinner but Gordon Ramsay staff turned it all around.

Loved, loved, loved the decor, different sections/seating areas and especially loved the bold,  colored stripes down the middle of the whole restaurant.  I'm a geek for great graphic design and this place kicked some major ass in that regard.\n\nMENU. Not huge (2 large pages), which was totally fine by me because it tells me they are sticking with what they do best. Only 2 vegetarian options for my friend, but a few sides were vegetarian-friendly... just not called out on the menu as such.  As a carnivore, I had more than my share of choices. \n\nSERVICE. Everyone I spoke with (phone-for reservation) and met were very friendly and helpful. Adam Z. was our server, and he was awesome.  Adam was fun, engaging, had the menu details nailed (which greatly helped my friend pick her entree), and a real sweetheart of a guy who made our experience truly memorable.  When you go (when...  NOT if), be sure to ask for Adam Z!\n\nLastly, THE FOOD.  Ah the food.  Veggie Dish of the Day:  delish.  Bacon Cheeseburger:  excellent. Truffle Fries:  fantastic. (Didn't have the Fish and Chips, but the guy next to me did and they looked heavenly.)  STCKY TOFFEE PUDDING:  THE BEST FOOD (not just limited to desert) IVE EVER EATEN...  EVER!!!   No exaggeration, the sticky toffee pudding is hands down the best thing I've ever had - it's an absolute MUST-HAVE when you go.  I just finished eating and I'm stuffed, but I'm seriously already planning to go back tomorrow just for the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and the next night...\n\nSuch a cool place with fantastic food. p.s.

It took a long time to get a greeting.\nThe drinks were good.\nAtmosphere was nice, good for large groups.\nThe second star is for Randy for really picking up the broken pieces from the team we encountered during our visit. \nOverall my birthday dinner was distasteful and unpleasant from the service of the waiter to the improper food request from the kitchen."

There aren't five pages of options, which helps narrow the choices down. I highly suggest ordering appetizers to share. Not only will it cost the same amount as 3 regular entrees, but you get more variety and more food for your buck!"

Our party enjoyed our time and our food. Upon leaving I realized that I could not find my sunglasses. I immediately called and let the restaurant know. Unfortunately the 3 females located at the host stand were not very helpful. I believe the exact words were \"no one has turned anything in, you can check with security later. That's where we will turn everything in\" um... Ok? I literally JUST left ... One of those girls can't walk 10steps and take a quick look around the table and possibly the women's restroom??? You have to be kidding me. I understand that the conversation of what they did their past weekend is fascinating but, you just had a guest call about a missing item. This missing item can be easily tracked since I left less than 15 minutes ago. Nonetheless, it seemed hopeless so I turned around and headed back to the restaurant. A very kind gentleman in a suit (probably the manager) offered to assist. He walked to the back of the room and came back in less than sixty seconds with my sunglasses in hand! Thank you kind sir for being the hero. I know hostesses usually don't have the best reputation... But these three had the opportunity to change that tonight. Sorry ladies... Epic fail. Thank goodness there was someone else willing to step in. It may not be important to you, but if it's important to your guest... It should be important to you. This place would have received 5 stars otherwise."

I watch everything of his that I'm able to, having access to only what's on Netflix and Hulu, so when I saw that he opened a pub here, I jumped at the chance to go...especially since its a lot more affordable than the steak house. (still dying to try that one.)\n\nFor starters, we had the Warm Salty Pretzels, with the beer cheddar and mustard spreads.  These were absolutely delicious.  Good thing we split them between four people, because I could have filled up on those alone.  \n\nWe each got a sandwich/burger each:\nWelsh Rarebit Ham Sandwich:  I hate ham.  I really do.  But I wanted to try a bite of this sandwich so that I could say that I was brave and ate ham JUST because it was at a GR restaurant.  It was reallly good.  Open faced sandwich with lots of flavor.  My only complaint is that my first bite fell into my beer. :(  that was totally my fault though. lol\n\nPub Lamb Burger:  The menu gives you the option of feta or goats cheese.  My friend opted for the goats cheese, and I think this is the perfect decision.  The lamb burger was just a touch on the dry side, so the feta might have taken away from the taste of the burger.  With the goats cheese, it was flavorful and pretty good.  I'd order it, but like it a little less well done.  \n\nPub Beef Burger:  This is the one I got.  Of course, I added the applewood smoked bacon. (duh.)  I loved it.  I thought it was the best tasting meal of the group.  Not only that, but the beer that I chose (Lucky Buddha) went with the burger perfectly.  It was a good size, very juicy, and perfectly cooked.  \n\nI'm kind of ashamed to say right now that I might have gone too long in writing this review to remember the fourth sandwich.  I could have SWORN that my friend had a corned beef sandwich, but I'm not seeing it anywhere on the menu.  So it might have been the beef cheek one, but I'm not going to review because I don't recall.  Whatever it was, it was really flavorful. :D\n\nI loved how the sandwiches were all served with REAL chips...they were perfect as well.  Not a single one was over cooked, and they were't super greasy either.\n\nI will definitely be going back, and hope to save room to try the sticky toffee pudding next time.  \n\nThe staff was awesome, and I love the decor.  We were seated at a \"coffee table\" type setting with two love seats.  It was right in the middle of the restaurant, where I could watch the football matches in the other room (real football, not American.) :D  \n\nI felt that the price was good for the quality of the food.  4 of us ate AND drank for about $100.  Not too shabby.  \n\nHm.  Maybe I'll go back this weekend... ;)  Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm getting hungry again. :D"

Three kinds of pretzel rolls accompanied by an amazing flavored butter and an extraordinary cheese sauce. The burger was flavorful and cooked as ordered, which is phenomenal for any restaurant.  Our group is finicky, so kudos to our superb server, Kimberly, who must have a photographic memory.  The server/runner Lisa Marie was incredibly helpful and sweet. When we left, we felt we had two new friends!  Gordon Ramsay's homemade ketchup (and we're not even ketchup fans) is not to be missed. Michael loves the sticky toffee pudding here.

We went for lunch at 2pm; we didn't have nor need a reservation, the hostess seated us immediately. Our waitress was very pleasant and friendly, she took our drink order right away and returned with our drinks promptly. We then ordered food, my brother got the burger and I ordered the chicken sandwich. \n\nThe food came quickly (it was 2:30pm on Wednesday and not busy) but it wasn't very good. The fries were soggy and way over salted. My chicken sandwich was really greasy too. As I've stated before I've eaten at Gordon Ramsay's several times before, and this meal did not taste like Gordon Ramsay food, it tasted like Denny's. I'll definitely go back to Gordon Ramsay BurGR and Gordon Ramsay Steak, but not here."

I should've gotten a much better meal for what I was shelling out. And the decor and service left something to be desired. I asked for my drink to be served with my meal, and my meal arrived ten minutes before my drink, and I couldn't catch anyone to help me out, to the point where I didn't bother asking for salt, because I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to grab someone to bring me something that should've been on my table in the first place.\n\nWhich brings me to the table: I was seated in an oversized barstool, a ridiculous piece of furniture for even a pub/restaurant, making me wonder if Ramsey really did have anything whatsoever to do with setting up this restaurant.\n\nIf you're in Caesar's, don't bother with this place. Go to the Cheescake Factory instead. Better service and much more reasonably priced. And there's already salt on the table!\n\nRamsey, put this restaurant on your list for you own show!"

The charcuterie was good and the burgers tasty, but nothing special. If you're going to eat here, try the scallops. That dish was truly sublime. Atmosphere-wise, the place is open to the highly trafficked casino near the entrance to the Forum Shops, so there's no feeling of being anywhere special either. Service was unattentive and spotty."

I ordered the Beer Braised Short Rib meal that came with mashed potatoes, grilled carrots, and a brown sauce. The beef was the same meat that came on the nachos and was completely tasteless and bland. It tasted like bland pot roast out of a crock pot.

I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. \n\nShe told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. \n\nShe then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?\n\nFirst, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. \n\nOn a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?\n\nPlus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. \n\nAt 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, \"the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!\" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. \n\nMy first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. \n\nI went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?\n\nI'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. \n\nWould I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?\n\nI let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked."

            "review": "I have had two dreams involving Gordon Ramsay's pork belly, and that was just in the last week since I have eaten here.\n\nWe went to the pub last week for a nice, relaxing dinner. The restaurant was packed for a good reason, so we weren't able to get a reservation until 10:30PM. The reason why I was willing to wait was because when I went to the hostess stand and asked if they had a gluten free menu, the hostess pulled it out and it was full of GF happines. A pub with a gluten free menu? I never thought this was possible! Oh, but it was, and oh was it amazing.\n\nWe ordered their house chardonnay in a carafe. Very reasonably priced and went perfectly with all three of our dishes. It was a strong chardonnay, and I didn't want to stop drinking it.\n\nWe started off with the cauliflower soup with curry oil. I am very sensitive about curry. Curry is powerful and if used incorrectly, it can devastate or illuminate a dish. Since we shared the soup they split it into two bowls, no extra fee. The first sip? MIND BLOWING. The soup wasn't soup; it was so light and airy that it was actually like a foam. The curry brought a subtle smokiness to the dish and with the little saltiness from the bacon and sweetness of the caramelized onion, this became one of our top 3 soups. EVER.\n\nThen we ordered their salmon and pork belly as entrees, both which are naturally gluten free. The salmon skin was like a potato chip and the salmon was cooked to perfection. Not too raw in the center and perfectly soft and flaky all throughout. The cream sauce was subtle, not heavy and not overwhelming so that salmon was still the star of the dish. It went beautifully with the mushrooms and other garnishing vegetables. \n\nMy husband got the pork belly, the star of the night. Neither of us have ever had pork belly before, and I am now spoiled on pork belly and have very little hope that any restaurant will beat Ramsay's because this pork belly, even with all the fat, melted in my mouth and did not make me ill with greasiness. It was pork butter, and I could have eaten the entire dish had my husband not devour it before me. This pork belly was perfectly cooked and the sauce underneath was not rich was I LOVED because there is only so much my palette I can take before going into to overload. There is too much for me to say about this pork belly, so to avoid the novel, just eat it. You cannot go wrong. Also, grab a side of chips with fried truffle. Best chips my husband has had in the U.S.\n\nService was phenomenal, manager stopped by to see how we liked dinner, the environment and rhythm of the restaurant was smooth, sexy and upbeat and there is truly nothing I did not like about our experience here. We will absolutely go back VERY, very soon.\n\nMmmm,...pork butter...\n\nP.S. Throw down your Total Rewards card and save a few dollars!"

The line was really long and I was by myself so I decided to sit in the lounge.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I figured I was in for a treat..  Well I couldn't have been more wrong.  I guess my server Brianna had a horrible New Years Eve because she was the worst server I've ever experienced in my life.  I asked a few questions about the menu and she didn't know the answers, as well as she seemed even more pissed that I was asking her questions.  I mean, shouldn't the server know the menu well enough to help me figure out what I'm going to like or not like?  Her attitude was similar to a person that just got hit by a bus and then ran over by a steam roller.  If you get this server, RUN away..  She made me so mad I just ended up leaving.  I have no idea why they have horrible people like this working and interacting with customers.  All she did was totally upset me and make it so I'll probably never come back."

I made a reservation via Open Table directly from Yelp for 10 pm for after the Elton John show at the Colosseum. We arrived at 9:30 and were seated right away, even though there was currently an hour wait for the person in front of us. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on going.\n\nAs as others have said... OMG the sticky pudding! It is a must, one of the best desserts I have ever eaten.

I've watched every season of MasterChef/MasterChef Junior and Hell's Kitchen, so I feel like Gordon has subconsciously trained me to know how a decent meal is cooked. Unfortunately, my 1st negative YELP review goes to the fish n chips entr\u00e9e. I remember him on a MasterChef season yelling at a contestant for putting steamy, hot food over fries. Why? Because it makes a soggy mess on the bottom of the fish batter and soggy fries on top. Also, the batter was way too heavy that I scooped out the cod which ended up to be terribly seasoned and bland. Our waiter says that this entr\u00e9e is the most requested..really?! I know he just opened up a fish n chips restaurant, and I hope it's a lot better than what I ordered. \n\nHowever, my mother ordered the Shepard's Pie which she thoroughly enjoyed. I did appreciate the kind hosts in the front and our waiter who was very friendly and engaging. \n\nPlease make sure that soggy fish and chips doesn't get through the pass..you might disappoint more Ramsay fans other than me. Chef Kristin from Hell's Kitchen was my all time FAV, so it might have been just an off day. I'm just pretty bummed that I'm heading back to LA not raving about this place to my friends."

Normally, I take food home because I cannot eat all of it or I eat just enough to be almost full, however, not the case here as after eating at Gordon Ramsay's the group headed out to Serendipity 3 for ice cream as we still had plenty of room in our bellies."

It was quickly served but was greasy.  See posted photos. Edible?  Sure.  Best we've had?  No way. Cost: $18.  Next we ordered something different in theme with and saluting British food.  Bangers and Mash.  This meal consists of three different sausages plated within a double scoop of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were good. The sausages were essentially flavorless and they were a bit undercooked and tough.  We both agreed we would not order this again.  Cost: $25.  We could prepare the same meal at home for $4, and it would be a lot better.  My wife is a 5 star chef, so we routinely taste and rate meals which can be a challenge to prepare correctly. Yes, this is Vegas, but we are expecting superior quality food and great flavors, which are prepared correctly.  Here we didn't get it."

At the time, the waiter and manager apologized profusely but later lied and twisted the story to Caesars liability department, blaming me for knocking over the drink tray by reaching for the bill (the bill was set on the table by the waiter who leaned over me, tipping the tray of drinks and broken glass all over me while I was seated).\nIt's a casino restaurant, so no doubt there were cameras that caught the incident.\nThey refunded the meal but wouldn't pay for the laundry bill ($70 through the hotel!!). \nReally don't think it was a lot to ask. It goes without saying that the whole dining experience was spoiled. I walked back to my hotel (Aria) soaked and smelling like a drunk at 1:00 in the afternoon.\nI ended up paying for the laundry bill myself so my hotel room and suitcase wouldn't stink like beer! \nTo this day, I'm still super annoyed that the waiter would lie as he did and that the restaurant manager would allow it. When I returned home, I continued to discuss reimbursement with Caesars regarding the laundry bill which was eventually denied. Awful business practice.\nDefinitely will not be visiting the restaurant on our trip to Vegas this year even though our friends had thought about it. After telling them this story, they were as PO'd as I was."

Housed in Caesars in a sizable space renovated from Bradley Ogden featuring plenty of wood, kegs, television, and Brit-kitsch it was just after noon when I sat down with two old friends and greeted by friendly, though pushy, service orders were expedited to the tune of an appetizer, a side, three mains, and two desserts - high prices and small portions tempered by a Total Rewards card...at least slightly.  Focusing mostly on signatures and favorites present since the menu's inception dining began with three small but lovely seasoned pretzels paired with cheese and mustard for $8 and progressing to plates proper another trio arrived in the $21 trio of small ramekin-pies, all well prepared but only the lamb loaded Shepherd living up to the high standards set by the exemplary golden cod selected by my friend, soggy 'chips' notwithstanding.  Ignoring the shortrib and what I'm told were vastly overseasoned potatoes while wishing some form of seasoning had graced the flavorless mushrooms it was with sweet redemption that desserts both shined, the rustic Sticky Toffee Pudding every bit as good as the fancy version at Steak and the \"DIC\" a bowl of buttery custard hefty with raisins and aromatics that I'd gladly return for along with a cup of coffee - breakfast, lunch, or dinner."

(I think the waiter had tables scattered all over the place and not in one vicinity).  The food was a little pricey but I loved the display of the food, originality, and atmosphere.  From my experience, almost everything in Vegas is pricey (even more than NYC) unless you grab a burger from McDonalds.   \n\nThe drink and dessert menu was on an Ipad and gave you descriptions of the drink cocktails.  I got a drink that I can't remember the name but it had Guinness Cream, Boddingtons Ale, Jack Daniels Honey and something else...but all I know it was fantastic and I never drink Jack Daniels anything!  The cocktails were $15 each.  My bf got corned beef in a bread bowl that actually looked good (I never eat corn beef). I got the hamburger which was $19, with bacon would have been $23. All the french fries are 4 huge pieces of potato with a garlic seasoning that come with the meals.  \n\nI was told Ramsay had checked in the day before with the restaurant and I saw the head chef walking around.

She was extremely nice and had ties to Chicago. She was the one of the few people in the entire city of Las Vegas who did not have an attitude! lol, but she was spectacular to have around. Also, two members management were extremely attentive throughout dinner service, did not get their names but they were in suits so I can assume it could've been the GM and Assistant GM. \n\nSidenote: *We were in a rush because we did not want to be late for the concert, we did not tell our server this because we also did not want to rush the experience of being at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. We ordered truffle fries as our appetizer and the 14 oz. Ribeye and the Salmon entree. The food arrived to our surprise so quickly! First the fries, then the entrees, at our table no less than 15-20 minutes cooked to PERFECTION! We both shared everything and was quite full!\n\nTruffle Fries: truffle fries are huge in Chicago and we already knew that we loved them so we definitely wanted to give it a try, the fries were perfectly crispy and the truffle aioli was perfect! I don't usually care for the truffle aioli but this one was delicious!\n\n14 oz Ribeye: Cooked to absolute perfection, our mouths melted, not the steak, our mouths did. That's how delicious this steak was. I've been to plenty of steakhouses before, but when I say that the quality of this beef gave it a flavor like no other paired with perfect seasoning, and seared to perfection. I wanted to cry, that's how good the steak was.\n\nSalmon: With salmon, the trick is getting a crispy skin, a lot of times you get salmon from a restaurant that comes with an unnecessary slimy texture. Not here! I feel like I am repeating myself by saying everything was perfect, but it's been a week since I was here and I have not forgotten about it at all.\n\nI had to tell the manager how amazing the entire experience was and he served us a English Toffee desert that was poured table side and was scrumptious!!!!! \n\nChef Ramsay, OPEN A RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO! I BEG OF YOU! I personally thank you for this establishment and I 100000% recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas and to anyone who is a fan of Chef Ramsay's monopoly of cooking shows. This was definitely one of the highlights out of Vegas' amazing options and I will never forgot coming here! I couldn't have had a better eating experience!\n\nWe even got to meet Scott and take a picture with him!!!\n\n- Devin Torkelsen of DevinTorkelsen.com"

The Hellfire Lollipop wings were tasty but a little tough skinned, overcooked. Our appetizer fries were tasty. My husband, a huge fan of Gordon, was hoping to have his mind blown by the shepherds pie. He said it was solid, rich, good, not quite amazing. My daughter ordered the Ceasar salad, it was barely mediocre. Something about capers sitting on a romaine leaf is just kind of weird and looked a little like mouse poo. For dessert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding and is was absolutely perfect. Probably one of the best desserts I have ever had. Our service was also great, attentive and friendly. Not sure if we will go again, but if we do I would order the overpriced cod again and definitely the same dessert!"

            "review": "Lot's to say about this place...\n\nFirst, the decor with all the kegs would lead you to believe that this place is a good place for beer. It is not. There's a fairly limited selection, and they are not exactly impressive beers to choose from.\n\nWe were seated at a table that I'm not sure was originally intended for dining. It was low to the ground with sofas on either side. It was incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and I had to adjust numerous times so that my legs would wake back up.\n\nMy burger wasn't bad, but had too much of a taste to it that I can't place. Maybe garlic? It kind of ruined it for me. I wished later I would have tried something else. The fries weren't exactly the greatest, either.\n\nI'd give the restaurant three stars, but two things picked it back up for me.\n\nFirst, the sticky toffee pudding was very good. I had not had it before, so I can't really give a comparison to any other sticky toffee puddings, but it was so good I was sad when it was gone.\n\nSecond, the service was very good. We didn't even know our dinner was delayed, and we got apologies from the waitress, the manager, and the person who brought out our food. Seems that there was an issue with getting it out from a ticket being closed when it shouldn't have, so they redid the entire meal. Our dessert was free as well, which was a nice touch. It was nice to see that the customer service that Gordon is always preaching on Kitchen Nightmares held true for his restaurant."

She asked us what our last name was, in which my fiance replied: \"I will just tell you my first name, because my last name is very long, and hard to pronounce.\" So he told her his first name, and she preceded to still ask for his last name. My fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her, to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a \"Well, it's a 45 minute wait.\" I think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling, and pronouncing our last name; which she would have butchered if left to her. \n\nAfter that, we went to the bar. I am not a fan at sitting at the bar, but the bartenders were very animated and friendly. They served us our drinks and food quickly. The bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections. We ordered (I don't remember the exact names) the pub sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fish and chips. Me and my fiance share food a lot, and it is a wise idea to do that here,because the portions are large. \n\nI thought that the food was presented beautifully, and that it tasted good. The pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo, loved it. The pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard (VERY SPICY AND AWESOME), and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy. \n\nWhile we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves, we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum. We also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment. Clearly, doing their job is so exasperating for them. Gosh, they should take a break. \n\nI would come here again, and I would recommend it to a friend. I took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses. Ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot, and that those ladies up front gave us, and from what I'm reading most people, a bad taste in their mouth."

If what we experienced happened during dinner service on that show, someone would have been kicked out of the kitchen. \n\nMy boyfriend tried to order a beer, but we were told they were out of it and the server couldn't really recommend a comparable choice. So he gave us what felt like 15 minutes to choose another beer and then came back for our order. \n\nI ordered the chopped salad, Leo got the Shepard's pie and we share the pub chips. Everything was just OK. The chopped salad mentioned wood-grilled chicken, but what I got resembled shredded rotisserie chicken - pretty bland. And then midway through our meal, we got bread service - which made absolutely no sense. \n\nLeo ordered another beer and after our meal, we asked for the dessert menu. And watched our server schmooze with a larger party for 10 minutes before we could flag him down and ask again. Once we got the menu and picked out a dessert (Sticky Toffee Pudding, which was actually very good), we had to wait until another server tapped ours on the back to let him know we were waiting. \n\nBy the time we finished everything, nearly two hours had passed and the place was pretty much dead. It may have just been because we had a poor server that night, but we would never go back to this place."

We took pictures with the British background while we waited and posted on facebook. It was nice for social media purposes, I guess. We had the bad luck of ending up with a wobbly table and it ended up shaking and spilling water everywhere and the cloth napkins were water-resistant so it was hard to clean up. \n\nThe burger itself was pretty good, although it was strange that I couldn't tell if it was beef or lamb- i'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. The cheese on the burger was good and the fries were good.

The service was friendly, but nothing special. The braised cheek sandwich was phenomenal and the clear winner at the table. The fish & chips were tasty, but the mushy peas were under seasoned. The bangers & mash were disappointing b/c the bangers lacked flavor and the mash were under seasoned. However, the biggest disappointment was that after ordering the appetizer (burger sliders w/ an unpopular spread) w/ the mains... THE APPETIZER CAME OUT AFTER THE ENTREES!!! Since we ordered everything at the same time, I can only assume the fault lies in the kitchen and not w/ the server. Even more disappointing is that they CHARGED US for the late appetizer! The server apologized for the inconvenience, but are you kidding me?! Chef Ramsay has higher standards than that. Best of luck & congratulations Ja'Nel!"

I have also dined at the London NYC and it was one of the best meals of my life.  Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill?  Not so much.\n\nWe waited at the bar for the text that our table was ready and the wait was the highlight of our experience.  Great drinks and friendly bar tender.  He made great recommendations of what to eat and seemed to know the menu well.  We were seated just after finishing our first drink which was perfect.\n\nAfter that it was all downhill.  The table we sat at was directly behind the hostess both so it was a high traffic area but it was so close you could reach out and touch them.  Not only was it awkward placement but the table was far to short, both in height and depth, for the 2 chairs and booth that were pushed up to it.  Strange and uncomfortable, but I could get past it for great food and service.  Unfortunately we got very little of either.\n\nThe waiter was friendly enough and for some reason felt the need to share that he was a competitive eater (even called another staff member over to prove it).  Again, awkward, but whatever.\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Scottish Egg, as recommended by the bar tender, and it was good.  Not great, but good.  There were 3 of us, we had the Prime Rib, Diver Scallops, and Fish and Chips.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very good (best entree ordered), the batter on the Fish and Chips was flavorful but slid right off the fish, which was tasteless, and the french fries didn't have any salt at all.  The Prime Rib was extremely bland but the mash potatoes were pretty decent.  For desert we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was definitely the star of our dining experience.  I have watched Gordon make it on TV for years and was very happy that I wasn't disappointed.  \n\nFor what I have reviewed so far I would have given 3 stars but the service is where it really fell flat.  Every single dish we used from our drinks, to the apps, to dinner, to desert were all still on the table when we left the restaurant.  We were out of drinks, even water, 45 min before we got our check, which I had to wave our waiter down to request and then it still took another 20 minutes before we got it.  Outside of taking our order and delivering food he only stopped at our table to check on us once the whole hour and 45 minutes that we were seated.\n\nI saw the manager at the hostess both several times and tried to get his attention to inform him of our experience but he never would make eye contact.  Normally I would have got up and went to him but at this point I was annoyed and just wanted to leave.\n\nNeedless to say for a meal that cost over $170 (not including the $60 we spent at the bar) I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  This is a restaurant worthy of Gordon's show Kitchen Nightmares!  What a shame.  I hope, Scott Commings (Hell's Kitchen season 12 winner) will turn things around when he takes the head Chef position and hopefully that is soon!"

I ordered the onion soup and the shepherds pie and my boyfriend ordered the burger and fries. Both of us kept eating way after we were full just because it was so good. The service was fast, really friendly, and helpful with recommendations. The decor is hip and comfortable, and there was no wait at all on the last weekend before Christmas, which was a plus.\n\nThe only cons in my opinion were 1) the price of beer, which is typical of restaurants in the casinos on the strip and 2) being seated right beside other patrons lacked privacy and was not seemingly necessary.\n\nI think this restaurant is a great example of what sets an expert like Gordon Ramsay apart from the rest. Everything was clean, organized, friendly, simple to understand, food was made very well, and the experience left us wanting to come back with friends."

First impressions nice atmosphere clean bright vibrant. We sat down with our daughter and waited about 20 minutes for a server to come. I was hungry and went straight away for the toad in the hole and the diver scallops I told the waiter I had not had toad in the hole in over 20 yrs. he explained it was not traditional at which I realized it was basically a pig in a blanket. I changed my order to scotch egg and chicken curry my wife had fish and chips. When the waiter eventually came with the food all at the same time I think a quail egg was used for the scotch egg I got scallops instead of the curry. My wife's food was okay at best for $16 F&E but they cost $30. Scallops overlooked. $180 for two and a half peeps with two drinks each. A lot of dosh for bad nosh, Done!!!!!!!"

I always get my steak well done and always tell them no pink, butterfly is OK, had to send it back because it came out pink. Second time around it was perfect and very tender. As of this writing the online menu differs from the actual menu, in my case the steak only came with asparagus no potatoes or seasonal vegetables like the online menu states.

He was so inattentive and disregarding - I'd like to say I forgot his name, but the dude didn't even introduce himself. He seemed focused on other people, giving the feeling of someone looking through you as if you ceased to exist. \n\nA mixed thumb up for their Beer Braised Short Ribs. Unreasonably priced and it wasn't as tender as one would expect - The flavor screamed & howled, 'Puuub'.. And rightfully so, 'cause we were in one. Nothing exciting here, it seemed to lack flavor all together. A tad chewy and bland would describe this dish best. What WAS good was the potato puree. It lasted all of 1 minute as did the vegetables which were just okay.  \n\nTwo thumbs down for the Crispy Calamari. It was more soggy and flimsy than crispy, which is disappointing when you want that snap and crunch. The fresh dill tartar sauce was actually tasty, just wish we had something other than the calamari to dip in it! \n\nShared a wedge salad that was straightforward. They didn't overdose the thing with blue cheese nor vinaigrette and were rather generous w/ the bacon. Fresh bites of this wedge salad overpowered the emotional depressant disguised as the Beer Braised Short Ribs. Sad, a salad won us over and it wasn't all that!\n\nToss our table next to the outer railing, where drunks, kids and families stroll by and stare at you and your food.. we've now created an all around unpleasant experience. \n\nAt least I went to a Gordon Ramsey eatery, though, we were highly disappointed."

We had reservations and when we got there we noticed all of the tables that seat more than 2 people use only high backless stools for chairs.  My youngest is 4 years old and while she could sit up there fine it was not something I really wanted to chance.  There were two cocktail type tables in the middle of the restaurant that were open but they said at first that we cannot sit there because there is no server for those tables.  Really on a friday night you dont have servers for all your tables?  Seemed a bit fishy to me but in the end we were able to sit there although after waiting 15 minutes we had to go back to the hostesses and say the waiter they said would help us still has not shown up.  Once he did show up our waiter was good but not anything special in the least.  The drinks were ok, one of us had a blueberry smash and I had a grapefruit drink from the cocktail menu.  Both again were good but at $15 I thought were a bit overpriced.  I will only speak for my own meal and I got the flat iron steak which was $30+.  When I received it, it looked liked 5 sliced small pieces of steak.  I couldnt believe that for that price the portion was so small.  All in all I think we were all let down by this restaurant mostly for its lack of value, slow and not that friendly service and seating arrangements."

Both times we sat at the bar without wait and watched the games on the tv's that they had.  Made it convenient to get away from the sportsbook to grab a bite to eat and drink and not miss the game.  The first time we went, we ordered the chicken wings, deviled eggs and sliders.  The chicken wings were pretty tasty and a nice portion.  The deviled eggs were not cut as beautifully as I'm used to, but it didn't sacrifice its' taste, they were still delicious, topped with bacon.  The sliders were pretty good as well.  Not a huge fan of the bun type but the patty, cheese and bacon were a good combination.  The second time we came I had the corned beef brisket sandwich and the butter chicken with rice.  The corned beef brisket was moist and delicious.  I wish it came with fries automatically instead of the kettle chips, but the chips were good as well.  The butter chicken was also a great dish even from a place that doesn't focus on Indian cuisine.  The pita bread was good but I probably would have preferred the butter chicken to have a little more of a punch and spice.  Service was great both times, everyone was very nice and attentive.

Our seats ended up being right near the edge of the casino and near the posted menu which was distracting for me.  Since it was a Sunday the tv's all had football games on them with the sound playing loudly over the restaurant speakers.  While i enjoyed that, i wish the volume would have been a bit softer.  The decor of the restaurant itself is quite cool with one room being divided from another with a wall of kegs and then there was some cool chandeliers and a lounge type area.  I also enjoyed the wooden chargers on the table as well as the silverware of which the bottoms reminded me of the St. George cross. What i didn't enjoy was the outfits of the staff as the hounds-tooth was hideous and i would have to agree with other users who said it made them look cheap and trashy.\n\nFor an appetizer my fiance and I started out with the duck confit poutine.  Whenever it first came out I was unable to see any of the duck but I eventually found it lurking in the goodness of the poutine.  My favorite parts of it were the duck and cheese although the fries were nice and crispy except for the ones that sat too long in the duck gravy which ended up being overly sweet for me.  Who would have thought that this Canadian dish would end up on a English pub menu.  For my main course I decided on the shepherds pie.  Whenever it came out I thought that it looked a bit small but I was stuffed by the time I had finished it all.  The base was a mixture of beef and lamb combined with some carrots and peas and then topped with some mashed potatoes.  In the end it was a decent dish as the meat was tender but it did not really wow me at all.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably not come back to the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grille in the future.  While my meal was ok, there are too many other places nearby that are better and at the same price point or even cheaper."

The scotch egg was just ok. They also have a very nice beer menu. Service was fast and friendly. Nice place to grab lunch and sit watching the people in the casino go by. I would drop in again to try something else sometime. Exact three star place."

The staff was terrible, it took 15 minutes to get water I had asked for 3 times.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but it's Las Vegas & a shrimp cocktail.  The whole town pretty much has this dish nailed.  I'd suggest trying one of the other 647480 restaurants within walking distance."

Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill was actually an accident because one of our other places was a bust.\n\nThe Experience:\nWe came around 2pm for a late lunch and were seated right away.  The experience here started off a bit rocky since our waitress never came, but once we asked the manager what was going on, we were seated at a different table with a very friendly waitress (her name was Bridgette I believe).  The manager (his name was Derek) was extremely apologetic and checked on us often through the duration of our meal.  He even offered to comp our appetizer, which was a really nice touch, and alleviated any possible hostility that we might have had.  Derek was probably the highlight of our experience since he was so accommodating and warm.  He truly went above and beyond for us.  Thank you Derek!\n\nThe Food:\nBoth my boyfriend and I had the lobster rolls, shared a chicken caesar salad, and lastly the toffee pudding.\n\nLobster rolls:  Great portions, but lacked a little flavor.  I expected a bit more or maybe something different, but still delicious.\n\nChicken Cesar: Comes on large leaves of lettuce, but generous portions of chicken, and the dressing was phenom.  Very delicious.\n\nToffee Pudding: We bought it per recommendation from Derek...it was incredibly delicious.  Im not a super fan of caramel, and even I demolished this thing.  It was perfection.  The caramel is served warm and you pour it on top....YUM!!\n\nAll in all...wonderful..and we will be back! :)  Thank you Bridgette and Derek!"

This was hands-down my favorite lunch out of all the places we tried on vacation.\n\nFirst of all, I loved the decor of the restuarant.  You really felt this is what a real English pub would look like.  It could be an Americanized version for all I know, but I still liked it.\n\nOur service was great.  Very friendly wait staff.  There were water spots on my husband's fork, which isn't even that big of a deal, but our waiter noticed it (without us pointing it out first) and replaced it right away.  I thought that was a very nice, above-and-beyond touch.\n\nI started off with a very delicious cocktail called Goodbye Blue Sky, which was blueberry vodka, Chambord, sparkling wine and fresh lemon and blueberries.  So refreshing.  I hardly ever finish my cocktail at any place I go, but this one could have easily begat a second one as much as I loved it.\n\nWe decided to pass on appetizers as we didn't really want to stuff ourselves for lunch (knowing we had a very large dinner ahead of us later).  I debated on what to order because so many things sounded delicious.  Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, even considered ordering several apps as my entree (Scotch Egg - yum!).  Finally decided to go classic English pub and ordered the Fish and Chips.  This was without a doubt the best fish and chips I've ever eaten.  Three lovely pieces of beautifully battered white fish - the texture was spot on (crispy and light), fish cooked to perfection.  Served with a side of mushy peas, which were also very tasty.  They were minty, although I didn't taste too much of it.  If I could complain about anything, I'd say the fries were nothing special.  The weren't horrible by any means, but for $30 you may expect something hand-cut at the very least.\n\nEverytime we see a Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert, we have to try it.  For something not chocolately, this bread pudding is surprisingly good.  Warm, with a rich caramelly drizzle atop a delicious sweet cream ice cream.  It's like a comfort dessert - you leave feeling wrapped in a warm blanket, cozy and comfy.  Perfect ending to a fantastic meal.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't keen on was the price of the food.  Now, I can eat expensive food, and have no problem paying for it.  But let's be honest - this was not an upscale 5-star restaurant.  It's a pub with above average food.  It's not overly gourmet or made with luxury ingredients.  I'd say you're paying for the Gordon Ramsey name for the most part.  Don't get me wrong cuz the food was spectacular, but it could definitely handle being slightly cheaper.  Lunch food shouldn't cost over $100 for two people."

Good for him, bad for us,  but it didn't occur to him to think that way.  My husband ordered rack of lamb, and since the apps we wanted were not available he asked about the portion size and was told it was \" three bones\". When  the dish came with two, he asked the waiter about it and the waiter said he would check with the kitchen, then came back and told us he was misinformed  and the serving  went by weight. However, he agreed that it looked like a double cut chop, not a rack of lamb for $38. The meat was chewy,had no sauce, & needed seasoning. My  scallops, a dish Ramsay routinely dumps in the trash on his show, were nicely browned but served in a tasteless broth that made them a soggy mess. Although our waiter became more apologetic when the table next to us also complained about their lamb, and brought us a complimentary dessert, it was a really disappointing meal.

They had a prime rib special   It was around 10:30 pm so we checked to make sure they still had prime rib before ordering.  We even joked with the server about who would get the last piece if they ran out.  3 of us ordered it.  We also ordered an appetizer.  About 30 minutes later she comes back and tells us they are out of prime rib. No kidding. Somehow it took 30 minutes to let us know they were out.  I ordered the ribeye instead. I then realized we hadn't even gotten our appetizer. I asked her to include an extra app of wings since now everyone was starving.  \n\nMuch like our experience earlier that day at the Cafe Americano, our server then stopped coming back to our table. Food runners brought everything out.  My steak was pretty good. Another person in our party never got part of his order and had to cancel it.  \n\nWe asked her to split up the check and she brought out one bill with each party separated.  Of course a 20% was automatically added.  So I guess I now see why she had no interest in coming back to the table.  I know this is common but this is the result.  I will not return to this place."

            "review": "We've eaten here twice so far (both times selecting from the grill menu) and each experience has been different. Speaking to others that have dined here, it seems that your experience depends a lot on the server that you get. Both times the food was outstanding, but our first visit was somewhat dulled by the lackluster performance of our server.\n\nOur first visit was a weekday afternoon. We arrived just before 5:00 and it wasn't that busy--plenty of empty seats. We were told it would be about 15 minutes--strange since there were plenty of tables available. The hostesses are dressed in some sort of strange/tacky newsprint style dress that really isn't flattering. It seemed like everyone except the hostesses were busy--they were mostly standing around at the front kiosk chatting with each other.\n\nIt only took about 5 minutes to find us a table. The waiter stopped by after a few minutes, dropped off an iPad, and told us to order our drinks through it. No problem, except that it's for alcoholic drinks only and Brenda wanted an iced tea. BTW, you don't order off the iPad, you just browse--what a waste of a perfectly good paperweight. Brenda ordered the Braised Pork Belly with Sauteed Asparagus and I had the Filet Mixed Grill with sides of Creamed Spinach and Smashed Fingerling Potatoes. No starters, but we did snack on the delicious pretzel bread with butter and a cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was nothing spectacular, but the bread was warm and soft and went great with the English butter they brought out. \n\nFrom the time we placed our order until the food arrived was about 20 minutes.  Brenda's iced tea finally arrived after the meal was served. The pork belly was delicious--just the right amount of crispiness without being overdone. The asparagus was done to perfection as well. The lemon zest and thyme went perfectly with the sweetness of the asparagus. I had pork belly with my meal, but it just wasn't the same as Brenda's. It was a smaller piece and it seemed it was cooked just a bit too long. Still had the good flavor, but it was just a bit dry. The filet was OK, nothing to rave about, but at least when I ordered it mid-rare, it came that way. The shrimp weren't bad, but I just don't think you can get really fresh, good shrimp in Las Vegas. For me, the stars of the meal were the two sides. The creamed spinach with stilton cheese was perfectly seasoned and really complimented the flavor of the pork belly. The fingerling potatoes had black truffle with small chunks of British double cream. I could have eaten two servings of these. \n\nWe finally got to see our waiter again when he brought us the check. He didn't ask if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink. Small tip for this bozo. \nAll in all, it wasn't a bad experience. The food was as good as we expected, but the front of house staff turned what should have been an enjoyable dining experience into a mediocre one.\n\nOur second visit was much better than the first. We made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday evening to take our friends out for dinner. We were greeted warmly and waited less than a minute for the next available hostess to take us to our table.. It was a nice table away from the bustle of the casino with deep, comfortable chairs. Our waiter was there almost immediately and we were given the menus along with the useless iPad.  We placed our drink orders and before they were there our waiter was ready to take our order.\n\nThis visit we had two orders of the Braised Beef Cheek, one Fish and Chips, and I ordered the Grilled Rack of Lamb, replacing the olive oil crushed potatoes the great fingerling potatoes I had last time. Since we passed on starters, we continued snacking on the bread while we waited for the food to arrive. Very busy this night, but the staff didn't seem to be as disorganized as during our first visit. \nLike the last trip, the food was amazing and as before, Brenda picked the better meal. The beef cheeks simple melted in your mouth and the sauce was so rich and tasty, I wanted to dip some of my lamb rack into it. The plate of fish and chips was huge. The batter was crispy without overcooking the fish and the tarragon tartar sauce complimented it well. My lamb rack was cooked perfectly to a medium rare with a nice sear on the outside. The rosemary lamb sauce was tasty without having that overpowering rosemary flavor or odor. All during the dinner, the staff was attentive, refilling our drinks and water glasses. We definitely didn't suffer through the poor service we had the last time around.\n\nThis trip we all had dessert and each picked something different to try. Steph had the Potted Triple Chocolate Trifle which she enjoyed, but couldn't finish because of her large portion of fish and chips. Joe had the Spotted Dog (a bread pudding) which was tasty and quickly devoured. Brenda, who loves rhubarb, had the Rhubarb Cobbler. I had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I first had at GR Steak, and it was just as good and a few bucks cheaper."

Overall, had a good experience here. \n\nReally enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. Just dimly light enough so that it was intimate, and the servers were very nice and helpful. Our waiter was top-notch - and he even offered to connect us with a promoter for night clubs. The 3 stars is for the food, though. I sampled the pesto chicken sandwich and lamb shepherd's pie. Both were good, but nothing really wowed me. Some other friends tried the maple sage fried chicken sandwich, which they said was delicious (it looked delicious too). \n\nTo summarize, I was slightly disappointed dining at my second Gordon Ramsay restaurant. However, the food is decent according to Vegas standards, as you'll end up paying around ~$30 after tax and tip."

Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill has nice English pub fare that I would be happy to eat any time. \n\nMy friend and I split the steak and ale pie, fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, and truffle fries. All were very pleasing! The steak and ale pie was my favorite - the pie filling was fantastic. I wish I could get my own personal stews to have the same bold yet delicate flavor of steak, mushroom, and ale. \n\nThe fish and chips were also satisfying. I am definitely a harsh critic of the batter on the fish (after two years of living in Ireland and eating at my fair share of chippers and pubs) and this one was light and crispy, but still solid. I wish the fish was a bit more seasoned before it was battered, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some malt vinegar.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was gorgeous. Exactly the ooey-gooey cheesy consistency I look for in mac and cheese - and filled with lots of lobster chunks and flavor. The truffle fries were also fantastic. The truffle aioli had so many chunks of truffle that I was alternating dipping my fries and fish.\n\nMy other two friends ordered the lamb burger and the bangers and mash. Both enjoyed their dishes as well. \n\nAgain, we had a very good meal at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I would MUCH rather come back here rather than Gordon Ramsay BurGR any day!"

I thought we would have to wait a while for our food because the restaurant was packed, but the food came out right away! Big+ because I was tired and hungry. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was spicy and awesome. I ordered it well done bc I'm pregnant and I can't have it medium-well like I normally order burgers and steaks (my dr said no pink!). I was a bit worried because every time I have attempted to order something well done it comes back charred, which I absolutely hate. However, this burger was cooked to perfection! It is a bit on the expensive side (we paid $60+ for two burgers and two beverages). I expected it because of Gordon Ramsay's name being attached. It did not disappoint!

As to the menu it's not detailed enough 3 of us ordered \"toad in the hole\" but although the server questioned the order he didn't explain how much food it was, plus they were supposed to come with HP Sauce but didn't, when we asked for some they said they didn't have any (order hadn't come in). The food is ok, but the service is just so, so. One staff member was standing near us drinking Starbucks (bet Mr Ramsey would have something say about that on his TV Show if it was somebody else's restaurant). In the ladies toilets one was damaged and not in use, in both mens and ladies toilets they had huge wicker baskets to put your paper towels in, they looked stupid and tacky.

Well Gordon needs to visit his own restaurant. We waited over an hour for our food and when it finally arrived it came to the table in bits and pieces, even though there were only four of us. Two salmon dishes came out first and by the time the other two dishes came out, the salmon was cold. Gone are the days when the server knows who ordered what, now it's like an auction. At this price point, with only 4 diners the food should arrive at the same time and the server should be able to figure out the orders. One member of our group ordered the shepherds pie, it was very hot around the edges but really cold in the middle. This is one of Ramsay's signature dishes and it should have come to the table properly cooked. We sat in a booth and the seats were too low for the table, which was uncomfortable. The white wine glasses were very small, not conducive to enjoying the wine...I felt like a child seated at the big table and given a kids glass of wine. Our server was distracted and appeared overworked. Almost everything at Cesare's Palace is overpriced, as is this restaurant, but we don't mind paying if the food & service is good and the seating comfortable...this restaurant doesn't meet the standard of it's owner.

We had the following:\n\nAppetizers:\n1/2 dozen Lolli-pop chicken wings $12\nScotch Egg $11\n\nEntrees:\nChopped salad $16\n12 oz Grilled Ribeye $39\n12 oz grilled NY Strip $37\n\nSides:\nForest Mushrooms $11\nSauteed Brussel Sprouts $11\n\nDessert:\nSticky Toffee Pudding $11\n\nDrink\nInnis & Gunn $8\n\nThis meal was probably one of the best meals I've had in vegas. The scotch egg appetizer was pretty good with a nice bbq sauce and it came with marinated vegas. The chicken wings were not actually wings but drumettes. The sauce was AMAZING! It tasted like a honey, bbq, sweet chili, and hot sauce all in one. This is probably the appetizer I've in vegas. I would have to put this in my top appetizer list with Carson Kitchen's Bacon Jam. \n\nNow to the entrees. My wife said her salad was good with a lot of texture going on with the chicken, chickpeas, avocados, shrimp, etc. My ribeye was perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium. I liked how there were 3 sauces you could choose from (i forgot the names) but the one I got tasted like an au jus. My uncle said his strip was great and he got a gravy looking sauce. The sides were great too. The pork belly that was saut\u00e9ed with the brussel sprouts were melt in you mouth...so bad yet so good.\n\nThe sticky toffee pudding is Gordon Ramsay's signature dessert. That too was WINNAHS! (excuse my Hawaiian accent). It came with a toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. It didn't taste as sweet as I thought it would be. I was so curious to know why that i actually researched it afterwards and found out that this dessert is made with dates and brown sugar. \n\nMy uncle and I also tried the Innis $ Gunn beer. Our waiter, John, said its Gordon Ramsay's favorite beer. We both thought it was very smooth with a nice foam on top. It paired well with our meal.\n\nOveral, I would definitely come back again. The ambience was great and we were lucky enough to sit next to the tvs. Kudos to our waiter John for the great service.  The chicken appetizer and the sticky toffee pudding were definitely the stand outs. I've  been to his Burger resto in planet hollywood and now this one. Two down, one more GR resto to go!"

            "review": "Sadly, I have to give Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, a less than stellar review. I can only muster the kindness to give this restaurant two stars.  I must admit, that were my rating based solely on my latest dining experience there, I would give the restaurant three stars, and, had I based my review solely on my first dining experience there, I would have given four stars.  I'm sure that you will ask, \"How does the average of 3 and 4 equal two?\"  The answer: disappointment.\n\nThis will sound silly, but bear with me.  The reason I returned to P&G after my first visit is also the reason I will not return: potatoes.  Specifically, two potato dishes: the Potato Puree and the Pub Fries.  These were not ordinary mashed potatoes and French fries.  These were a demonstration of what a potato can taste  like if a fine-dining approach is taken when preparing ordinary dishes.  Every now and again you taste a dish and experience it for the first time all over again.  Such was my experience with the fries and mashed potatoes at P&G.  They made me feel that, as a foodstuff, potatoes have much more potential that I had previously imagined.  \n\nThe key to their french fries was the cooking technique: thick-cut potato planks, steamed, then lightly coated in seasoned flour, then deep-fried, then baked.  The result:  a hearty potato plank with a crispy outer crust that created the perfect seal to keep steam inside.  When you cut into them, you discovered a steamy, flaky potato meat.  These fries did not need any condiments whatsoever, and highlighted how good a potato can taste if treated properly \n\nThe mashed potatoes had a beautiful flavor.  The fluffy peaks of this dish were topped off with a drizzle of a chive infused olive oil that exploded in your mouth, filling your entire palette with the aroma of garden-fresh chives.  The key to this explosion was temperature of the potatoes: served piping hot.\n\nOn my second visit, I ordered these two side dishes again.  This time, the Pub Fries were plain, old french fries, and slightly soggy at that.  The mashed potatoes were a salty, gluey concoction that someone had tried to repair by thinning it out with copious amounts of cream and butter.  They were served cold.  \n\nOther highlights of the evening: arrived at 7:15pm and checked in for my 7:15pm reservation.  The hostess forgot to check me in, and when I made eye-contact with her every time she seated a walk-in customer before me, she quickly looked away and left the podium.  I approached a different hostess and was seated right away.  I ordered the seared scallops: scallops were seared on one side only. They were served in a bland seafood broth, with carrots, and artichoke hearts.  Not flavorful at all.  I ordered an espresso with dessert and it arrived cold.  The chocolate mousse trifle was sensational, though.\n\nAt any rate, I believe that what happened to this restaurant is not  so much carelessness on the part of its founder or staff.  It is a reaction to the caliber of the customer.  I spoke to the manager about the food, and he admitted that they had to change some recipes because their customers did not see the value in waiting extra time for french fries to be cooked three ways or for mashed potatoes to be prepared to order.  So, they have turned from their fine-dining philosophy to a food-mill philosophy: crank out orders.\n\nAnd that is where the disappointment lies.  P&G once provided a fine-dining take on British pub fare.  It now caters to the lowest common denominator and provides tourists a place to grab a quick bite and gain some bragging rights: \"I went to Vegas and ate at Gordon Ramsay's.  You know?  That guy from TV?\"\n\nSadly, the Gordon Ramsay on TV is no longer anywhere to be found at P&G.  The Gordon Ramsay on TV preaches fine ingredients,  food prepared to perfection, good seasoning, good service, consistency, and, above all, passion and pride.  Where is the pride to be found when you don't stand by your food, and, instead, you cut corners to ramp up production.\n\nSorry, that's not fine-dining.  That's a factory.  I'll gladly drop $20 at Applebee's for factory food.  Not $200 at Gordon Ramsay's."

There was a bit of a back up at the hostess booth. They were having trouble deciding who to seat first and there wasn't really in order to it. A little bit chaotic if you ask me, especially for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The restaurant is definitely British themed, no doubt about that. There were a few TV's playing the various games, but other than the medium size bar and the wall of empty kegs, nothing screamed pub. Once we were seated, they gave us the Ipad which had the drinks menu on it. I was fine with water, but my husband ordered a 20 oz Innis and Gunn. His drink was brought over fairly quickly and we decided to order the appetizer, while we decided on our main course. We ordered the pork belly entree to share as a starter. After deciding what we wanted to eat, we placed our menu's down on the table. Our server  came by and took them away without asking or getting our order! I had to flag her down to ask her to bring them back so we could order our food. A few moments after we ordered our entrees, our pork belly arrived. I had noticed that every other table around us had received bread, so I asked if we could get some bread. She said she had put out order for the bread in. We were almost finished with the pork belly roll, with pea puree which was very tasty, when our bread arrived. Around this time the server came over to refill our water glasses, she touched the spout of the water pitcher (which looks like a clear wine bottle) to the rim of my cup. Lucky, she had not refilled my husbands water, so I switched and drank out of his. When she came over to refill 'his' glass, she again touched the rim. I was able to waive down a bus boy and get a straw. Our dinner arrived and I decided to focus on that. I had ordered the lamb, while my husband had ordered the mixed grill, which included, filet, pork belly and shrimp. I had ordered my lamb medium and I felt and that it was on the well side, and I also thought that it tasted burnt. It was charred after all, but my husband tasted it and said it tasted fine. My taste buds are extremely sensitiveness at the moment, so I decided to let it go. My husband was happy with his dish, but the side dishes that we ordered to share got mixed reviews. We ordered the carrots, two ways (roasted and pureed) and the mashed potatoes. Neither side dish was served with a spoon. Keep in mind these are family style dished. Luckily, we didn't mind sharing. So we had to use our forks to get the carrot puree and the mashed potatoes out of the dishes. I was by no means happy about this and than the server came over to refill my water for the third time she not only touched the rims of the glasses but also the straws. In addition every time the server came over to our table she bent down so her face was at my level. I did not like this, especially when she was at the table next to us. When she bent over to them, her butt was in our faces. Not very lady like and not very professional at all. I was pretty much fed up with her service at this point. I walked to the front and asked to speak with the manager. I ended up waiting at the front for at least 5 minutes while being repeatedly told that the manager was on her way. When she finally arrived, I informed her what was going on in regards to our water glasses, and said I didn't appreciate that at all. I also questioned the method of serving side dished without spoons and she said that side dishes were not served with spoons. She said that she would follow me back to the table and observe. I thought the least she would do is have someone bring us new water glasses.  After a few minutes of waiting and never receiving new glasses, the server came over to ask what we wanted for dessert. We turned down dessert and asked for the check. The check in case you were wondering was not discounted in any way and was close to $200. I have now been to \"Steak\" four time, and always rave about it to my friends. Everyone was waiting for my review on the Pub and Grill and I will not be raving about this to anyone. I was so disappointed. Yes, I understand it is a Pub and Grill, it is not Steak, but I think that a little professional can go a long way- especially considering the prices at just a 'pub!' Little things like touching my water glass and then the glasses next tables and back again, doesn't make me very happy. Also serving side dishes that need spoons, without spoons??? This restaurant has a long way to go.\n\nNot Impressed"

I probably should have been given a choice or at least told there are two menus.  I will often eat \"dinner\" at a bar not just bar food.  So I ordered the Pork Belly.  Unbelievabe.  It was unique, extremely flavorful but surprisingly light.   That coupled with the bar tenders attentive service and the great selection of beers it was a good night out.   In the future please consolidate the menu into grill and pub so I don't miss out on any great food offerings."

All of the food lacked taste and no one in our group liked anything.\n The only flavor came from the Horseradish in the Ketchup, but we had to apply them to soggy, mushy  fries.\n\nFor a restaurant whose namesake is a person that judges the quality of other peoples food, I expected so much better.\n\nLooking back, I regret that I spent some of my vacation time and money at the Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill when I could have spent the same amount on Helicopter rides.\n\nMy advice, plenty of good restaurants in Vegas. Your money can be better spent elsewhere."

It's not really my favourite show as I don't subscribe to that form of people treatment. \n\nHad a fantastic group dinner on the evening I visited.  Everything here has a fine British pub touch. It's charming, different!  This is the third time I've eaten here. We had ordered some appetizers calamari and the devilled eggs. Both were above average.  For my main course I had selected the Scottish salmon which I had eaten two years ago. It came with a crispy skin and was succulent and served with some potatoes and greens on top. Really it was a very high quality meal. As a side we had some lobster Mac and cheese which was very tasty and brussell sprouts (nicely done). For dessert we ordered the trifle and also the sticky toffee pudding. I had a small serving of each and it was tasty and nice in presentation. \n\nWe ate in the private room in the back. Service was very good and of no issue.  My only interesting semi-negative is I had ordered a Sam Adams on tap and it tasted nothing like a Sam. I should have ordered an Innis and Gunn. \n\nI've seen some negative complaints on Yelp. Sure it's expensive, maybe you had bad or rude service.

Upon entering the hotel room I immediately noticed a magazine with Gordon Ramsay on the front \"Ramsay takes over Vegas\" Being a HUGE fan, I read it and got giddy when I found out that not only did Pub & Grill open already, but Burgr was planned to open that very night!! (Turns out it opened earlier in the week, but IT WAS OPEN).  \n\nWe decided to hit Pub and Grill on Saturday night. Josh was our waiter and I swear he had ESP. Every time we mentioned something we needed POOF there he was with it in hand or said...hey could you use...... I jokingly asked him if the bulldog lamp was wired. Josh was simply amazing. I can't say it enough. I would say he gave us the best service out of all the places we ate at this year. He gets brownie points for remembering my name is Darlene, so many people two minutes later forget and call me Diane, Donna...something with a D. \n\nOk now for the food. I ordered the Shephard's Pie and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger. The Shephard's Pie was good at first. The mashed potatoes were amazing. However, I quickly discovered I didn't care for lamb, my first time ever trying it. I ate about 1/2 of the dish. I soooo wanted to love it, but just couldn't. My boyfriend loved his lamb burger, said it was in his top 10 of burgers. We ordered dessert, I got the sticky toffee pudding and he got the chocoloate trifle. OH MY GOD!!! The sticky toffee pudding was to die for. I could eat that everyday!! The warm sauce topping the cake with a side of frozen cream was just fantastic. I tried my boyfriend's chocolate trifle and it too was incredible. Layers of chocolate with a brownie on the bottom and served with two little chocolate cookies was very cute. \n\nPub & Grill is not your typical Pub & Grill.......Gordon Ramsay does it again!!"

Ordering water was a choir and we didnt even get it the way we asked which was how the waiter offered it. The bus or water people had this pissed off look like they did not want to be there. I ordered a bottle beer and it took half an hour before i got it Mind you it was not that busy It looked disorganized and it seemed like the staff really didnt care about any of the customers Even the manager seemed like he avoided everyone. There are 2 menus pub and grill, the server didnt bother explain it I only asked becuase I saw someone else with it. After ordering food that took an hour and they seemed to confuse which tables. No apologies about the delays. We werent asked for desert, refills or if we wanted more from the menu. terrrible service. While we were there, we saw at least 3 customers complaining to manager about the service. At one point a customer got pissed and walked out. You almost want to warn people not to waste there time there.\n\nFood:  the food was average we had devilish eggs and the pretzels which was good. We ordered the Salmon from the grill menu and the Rib and cheek sandwhich The sandwich was good but nothing wow. The salmon was dry,cold and bland. We ended up sending it back. Of course no apolgies for thr food quality. Not up to par for chef ramsey also for what it was, it was overpriced. \n\nOverall, I wouldnt return unless the overhal the entire place.Too bad becuase it seems like it has potential Maybe chef ramsey should come down and film an episode of Kitchen nightmares to fix it.

Reminded me of some of the shlub managers Ramsey runs in to on Kitchen Nightmares.   Another manager at the hostess station was also a waste - we had 8:30p reservations and arrived promptly, we were asked by three different people why we were waiting - including a manager, who when we said we had reservations asked if they were for 7:45p - presumably to give us grief for showing up late... but then just turned and walked away - rude!!!\n\nI am a huge fan of Ramsay's TV shows -  so really wanted to like the whole experience, but it just wasn't happening. Luckily we had no specific plans for after dinner, because I never would have thought a pub and grill dinner would take two hours (it should not have - just inefficient).\n\nSheppard's Pie and Fish and Chips were very good.

The food was good, a very nice mix of European/English flair, although not a lot of selections for Vegetarians.\nThey have a nice ambiance for a Pub and I would suggest it for sure, it's a mix between a restaurant, bar & lounge - you can choose to sit in any.... EXCEPT.....it's VERY pricey.  Our meal, two people, was $125 :/ Eesh!  My husband had the Scottish beer and he loved it!  \"The pub includes 36 beers served on tap plus 24 bottled beers. With an eye towards dishes that pair well with beer the pub menu includes English ale onion soup, shepherd's pie, and a selection of sausages, fried egg sandwiches and the classic pub fish and chips.\"\n\nSave up your money before you go & Enjoy!!"

At first the service was great, but then after we ordered our food we could not find our server anywhere. We ended up waiting until 10:45ish to get our food and the place closed at 11pm. Our server never showed up again and we were given a new server after being left without one for a good 30-45 minutes. Our new server also was never seen until we asked for the bill. We were never offered refills on our drinks but luckily the bus girl kept refilling our water.\n\nAs far as the food goes it was also just OK. If it had come out in a timely matter I probably would have enjoyed it more. We had three burgers (two of the bacon and one hell's kichen) and the fourth person had the sliders and wings. The wings were actually pretty good and the burgers were cooked to our specifications, however our buns were soaked through with grease and everything was luke warm. I would not go back here when I am in Vegas again next year."

The whole place has a very British vibe which isn't surprising considering the man who opened it. It felt very comfortable and intimate which I truly loved!\n\nOur server 's name was Sarah and I really have to say she took the experience from a four star to a truly exceptional one! She was knowledgable about both the menu and the specialty drinks. She was so friendly and bubbly and she really went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing time and that's something I can't praise enough! She made excellent drink recommendations which I am so glad I took! Because of her I tried the most decadent Strawberry Beer! Something I've never had the pleasure of trying. It was presented in a champagne glass and it was not only delicious but visually stunning!\n\nWe started with quite a few appetizers; Warm Pretzels, Calamari, Truffle Fries, And Lobster Rolls. ( Don't judge there were five of us and we all shared!)\n\nAll the apps were very tasty but the definite stand out were the Lobster Rolls! Big juicy pieces of tender lobster wonderfully paired with a beautiful sauce and some small bits of cucumber for a nice crunch!\n\nFor our main dishes two of us got the Brisket Sandwich and the other two of us got the Lamb Burgers.\n\nThe Brisket Sandwich was absolutely delicious and absolutely huge!! Like two hands, jaw unhinged huge! I ended up taking my other half home! My fianc\u00e9 really loved the Lamb Burger, I sadly didn't get to taste it because I'm not the biggest fan of Blue Cheese, but both the guys finished theirs in a matter of minutes so it must have been tasty! I really like that all our entrees came with fries. I hate when everything is super pricey and al a carte. This really felt like you got what you paid for.\n\nLastly we got two orders of the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Please order this. I know you might be so full and you don't think you can make it one more bite but I promise you will be sorry if you don't!\n\nGordon Ramsay definitely did not disappoint! I can't wait to try some of his other restraints in Vegas!"

Hell's Kitchen is still one of my favorite reality shows and his steakhouse in Paris (the casino) is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere in the world.  All that said, I was woefully unimpressed with his Pub & Grill in Caesar's.\n \nGiven that we love GR, this was initially an easy pick for lunch after it opened in Caesar's.  The menu looked promising, and if it is GR, it has to be good, right?  Sadly, no.  Not even close.  \n \nThe wife went with the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips w/ Mushy Peas ($30) and got a single, small, bland fish patty and what seemed like frozen french fries.  The peas were cold and off-putting in both flavor and texture.  All for the bargain price of $30.  Gotta love Vegas, right?\n \nI ordered the Chicken, Kale, and Bacon Pot Pie ($24) and honestly believe that I've had better chicken pot pie from Marie Callender for 1/4 the price.  There were actually more vegetables than chicken, and it needed salt.  The pastry was dry and flaky, not the least bit buttery, and didn't do much to compensate for the lack of flavor in this dish.  I am so disappointed...even still.  C'mon, GR; you are better than this!\n \nThe main thing that salvaged a 2 Star rating was the service and the ambiance.  Our waitress was super fun and really made it feel like we were in a pub in London.  Other than that, and the wishful HOPE that a GR establishment can't possibly be this bad back-to-back, I likely won't give this place another shot...there are, literally, hundreds of other options in Vegas."

The sausage was perfectly cooked and the sauce/gravy went well with the mashed potatoes that also tasted really good.\n\nHowever....... was it worth 20 bucks? Probably not. \n\nThe rest of our party had a bunch of various dishes. I remember the pub beef burger being a popular one among our group. No one really seemed blown away by it. Again 20 bucks. \n\nI got the notion that a burger at Smashburger might be around the same caliber as the ones my friends were eating judging by their reactions when eating.\n\nThe duck confit poutine was OK. It was interesting, but there was definitely a lot more fries and cheese than any duck. I wish there was more duck since it actually tasted decent.\n\nThe bottom line here: the food is 'good', but not really worth it. The ambiance is nice, but the service is also hit or miss. Pretend you're that guy at a busy bar trying to order a drink for you and your friends. It's hard to get the bartender's attention right? That's probably what you're going to feel like when you try and get your waiter/waitress' attention.\n\nI think knocking 50% off the menu prices would be appropriate for the food that you'll be eating. Gordon Ramsay is a baller chef, but since he's not actually cooking the food, I have no problem dissing the restaurant and saying it's not worth the price."

When I received the bill I saw I was still charged for both servings of pigs, but the server refused to refund the money for the \"damaged\" serving with the hair:\n\n\"But you are taking food out; you have to pay for it.\"    I said, I'm willing to pay for all of it, but NOT the stuff that had hair it it.

The evening before we enjoyed a FANTASTIC dinner at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab (It's in Caesars...run...don't walk to this place if you want a wonderful dining experience) \n\nSo... we figured we would give this place a try, the menu price wise is about the same as Joe's, we expected something close to the level of service Joe's offers.... BOY we we wrong!  \n\nThe waitress sat us and the bench seat I was in sank down like an old worn out sofa... it was awkward to dine in. \n\nShe brought us an Ipad for the drink menu and didn't really go over the ordering process... we figured it out and pressed on. \n\nI ordered the mixed grill which comes with a couple of shrimp, pork belly, and a fillet.  When the food arrived the side dish we ordered did not show up. No apology, the guy just said he would go back and the dish would be out in 5 min. My wife ordered the Scallops with polenta...  Her scallops were not bad but the polenta was nonexistent ... her bowl looked empty LOL a few scallops and faint smear of polenta.  My meal... the steak was over cooked, it had a good flavor but wasn't nearly as good as the fillet I had at Joe's the night before. The pork-belly was the best thing in the dish and the shrimp were very plain... lacked any seasoning. \n\nAbout half way through the meal we stopped eating... called over the waitress who hadn't followed up about the missing side dish.  She went back... said it would be out in 5 min.  Again... no apology... nada.  Then she went on drifting around the place not doing much of anything.  We waited a little longer... said screw it and finished our meals.  Not once during the meal did the waitress check on us... offer to get us additional drinks... nada.  \n\nAs soon as we finished the meal... the guy shows up with the side.  I politely let him know we didn't want it... we had finished our meals. About 10 min later the waitress drops off the check... minus the side and says have a good night.  Again... never admitting there was an issue... just treated us like the millionth pain in the ass tourist she has served. \n\nFor a $150 + meal... you would expect better food and better service.  \n\nThis place was a huge letdown.  I only wish I would have read the Yelp reviews prior to wasting our time and money at this 2 star establishment.  I've had better meals and service and chain restaurants. \n\nAgain... if you want a great meal... with great service... I highly recommend you walk on down to Joe's on the 1st level of Caesar's Palace. You will not be disappointed. \n\n(PS... \n\nFrank"

It's really not conducive to locals visiting restaurants on the strip as we now pay for parking (we did valet) and still seems strip restaurants don't care about locals business. \n\nWe went early on 12/21/16 at 530pm were sat right away and waiter came over with a bottle of water to fill out glasses. \n\nI have never seen a bottle just explode and come apart like this one did, I had water all over my leg and shirt and the table was flooded. Luckily the waiter did not get sliced. \n\nWe were moved to another table as the floor was also soaked. Waiter apologized about five times and so did the lady assisting him. We saw them talking to the manager as well after. \n\nFood was very good we both had the Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries with one drink each. Service was spot on throughout and food was a solid four. \n\nWhat is amazing is the manager never bothered to come over and you would think one drink would be comped but nothing at all. Absolutely no customer service from the manager. I had cold water all over me and granted it was just water but we had to move tables and nothing was done by the manager. \n\nHonestly there is no reason to drive and pay for parking to get better service closer to home by places that want locals business. \n\nGordon Ramsey really needs to get better management here, we had issues the first time we came and it seems management is the weak part of this operation. \n\nFood and waiter were very good so if you are close it's worth it but it's really not worth driving as a local when our business is not appreciated by management."

He personally checked the kitchen when the man's burger next to me was delayed. And by delayed, I mean free extra wine bc it was a long time and the kitchen refused to serve less than well-executed food.\n\nI again, ordered the fish and chips. It's a pub and I wanted pub food. The fish was tasty, crunchy, slightly salty (in a good way), hot, flaky, moist, and HUGE. Plus, it was light and not greasy, beckoning additional bite after bite. and when my paced slowed, a little tangy, salty, texture-pleasing tartar sauce propelled me to finish every last bite.\n\nSo what no bread service at lunch. Not a deal breaker here and Ray did ask if we wanted dinner menus.\n\nThe chips were thicker, square fries, with crispy edges and hot, soft potato inside. The Parmesan and seasoning blend were delights and almost rendered the ketchup unnecessary. My husband finished his and started helping me on my portion.\n\nMy last time here I wondered why oh why, mushy peas? Now, these peas still retain enough texture to have some bite. They taste fresh. The savory, almost umami-like taste kept me going back bite after bite.\n\nHis pork belly sandwich delighted the palate with a nice blend of bitter, soft, crunchy, wet, sweet, and heat. He did request extra horseradish sauce but only offered me a single bite bc it was that good. He says he would order it again, and add a crispy or cheesy element. Still a hit in our books!\n\nBest part, Ray-Ray excellences advised in a more-British tasting beer, and delivered my husband a Guinness and Dunn from Scotland. It perfectly complemented his sandwich.\n\nWe will return!

I next decided to double-down and ordered the Pub Pretzels, Pub Burger, and chips.  The Pretzels were pretty good.  The burger was a huge, decently cooked patty, while the 'chips' were mildly soggy steak fries.

I was so eager to eat at a celebrity restaurant, that we waited about 1/2 for a table.  When we sat down, we had no silverware at the table and it took forever for the busperson to bring us silverware.  Turns out that the busperson that was cleaning the tables was upset at the waiter and I can see why.  He was the most jabber jaw, impersonal server that I have ever met.  Kept asking us personal questions and wouldn't let up until I stopped answering his questions.  His constant talking was making me very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen he finally came around to taking our order, my girlfriend ordered a coffee along with dessert, an Apple & Rhubarb crumble while I ordered a tall Sierra Nevada and a Grilled Beef Burger, 9oz, cooked medium with Applewood bacon and fries.  My girlfriends dessert came before the coffee and my beer came when he, the server, brought the coffee to the table 5 minutes later.  After waiting 20 minutes, I finally got my burger.  It seems that there was something missing.  I took a bite out of it and it was good, but it turns out that the burger was not cooked to my order.  It was cooked medium rare, not medium as I requested.  Plus there was no bacon.\n\nWhen the server came back to the table to see how things were, I told him that the burger was not cooked to what I had requested and that the bacon was not on the burger.  He took it back and said that he will get the chef to grill up a new one for me.  Now, a 9oz burger take approximately 4-5 minutes cooking time per side (depending on the fire temperature) to come out medium.  I got my burger in 4 minutes.  It seems that the burger that I received, less the bacon (again), was sitting on the serving table already and was not cooked medium, but more like medium well.  Yes, i do know the difference between \"Medium Rare\", \"Medium\" and \"Medium Well\". \n\nWell, since I was hungry and it felt useless talking to the server, I took a bite and told him it was OK.  I knew that it was not cooked fresh, but I wasn't about ready to wait 1 hour for a burger that I considered was not good.  Believe it or not, it also lacked seasoning.  At one point later on, I bit down on something in the burger and it turned out to be a bone.  Luckily I didn't chip a tooth.\n\nI immediately stopped eating it and pushed it aside.  I was very disappointed.  The manager came to the table and I told him what happened and he didn't seem interested in wanting to correct the problem that I had.  So, I assumed that he would, but when we got the check, all the orders were on it and nothing was comped.  So much for excellent customer service from management.\n\nI walked out of the place very disappointed.  I told my girlfriend how much Gordon Ramsay hates it when people return food from restaurants that he is helping in \"Kitchen Nightmares\", so I wonder how he would react when he learns that patrons are returning food from his own establishment.  Maybe someday, he'll read this review.\n\nOverall, I give the following for overall performance:\n\n2 Stars: Food & Service\n3 Stars:  Ambiance & decor\n1 Star:  Server"

I'd do just as well to get fresh fries from McDonald's. The sprouts were a little better with the balsamic, bacon, and I think apricot...

But he didn't go out of his way to be friendly, and we didn't see much of him for the rest of the night.  He finally came and asked if we wanted our drinks refilled at the end of the night, to which my wife said \"just the check,\" even though we really did want refills (but 15 minutes earlier).  \n\nI don't mind paying big bucks for good food, or even decent food and good service, but this was decent food and poor service in a city where there are limitless options.  Needless to say, we won't be back unless Mr. Ramsey can class the joint up a little."

I ordered the trio sampler of pies that included a chicken pot pie, steak and pie, and shepherd's pie. They were well-cooked, ingredients were of good quality, and was wonderfully seasoned. I don't know why most restaurants underseasoned their food, but it was the perfect amount of salt here. \n\nUnfortunately the prices were INSANELY high and I felt so bad for the wait staff. Their uniform is a cheezy body tube houndstooth patterned dress with some pleather bustier thing. Weird."

I got the lamb burger which was delicious and plentiful. We also ordered a side of their infamous wings which definitely hit the spot. Large hearty portions are what you are sure to find. You will definitely not leave hungry. Their bar is stocked and the drinks are made with great professionalism. With all that being said, there are a limited amount of chairs with backs. There are mostly large square cusioned stools which are cool unless you have back issues which will surely leave u uncomfortable and aching during and by the end of your meal. All and all this restaurant will definitely see me again sooner than later."

Pricey but typical for Vegas I guess. \n\nI was seated against the wall in a ridiculously low cushioned bench seat. I'm 6'3\" and I can't imagine how awkward it must be for others to have to eat like that. The server was really low on energy, no smiles, just smirks even at my low brow attempts to lighten the mood. She really never did perk up much, I had to continually ask for more ice tea. \n\nThe lamb burger was just ok. Not much, if any, seasoning. The 4 sticks of french fry potato slices were also cute but not very tasty. Dessert was fine, the toffee pudding thing seemed like a safe bet. \n\nOverall, I don't recommend it and I wouldn't return. We had a much more entertaining dining experience at Grand Lux Cafe at The Venetian/Palazzo for half the cost. And that waiter smiled all the time as she kept my iced tea filled to the brim!"

We got there on a Saturday night and were told there was a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar to have a drink.  There were MANY (clean) open tables so the only reason I can think of to have to wait is that they were understaffed.  I decided to get a specialty cocktail.  I believe it was a Belgian margarita or something like that.  The extremely sweet liquor that was in it drowned out the other flavors in the drink.  It was like drinking a sweet slurpy.  And the bartender was not friendly at all.  She was border line rude.  Definitely not in the right business.  Our waiter, however was great and knowledgeable.  The mini-lobster rolls were fine, nothing special.  The lobster mac and cheese was very good but there was not much lobster in it at all.  The brussel sprouts were good.

Dining room is much larger than it appears from the outside.\n\nKETTLE CHIP NACHOS: huge portion of house-made kettle chips topped with corned beef, short rib, and English cheddar cheese. Definitely a shareable portion, in terms of size of the dish and how well the flavors worked together.\nMAINE LOBSTER & SHRIMP ROLL MINIS: Two cute little rolls packed with shrimp and lobster salad. This version is way better than those served at the Phillips Seafood nearby. Generous amount of lobster and perfectly toasted, buttered rolls.\nGRILLED LAMB BURGER: Yes, it's as good as other reviews say. Lamb was cooked perfectly medium, topped with curry onions (flavor was subtle) and a thick layer of goat cheese and feta spread. The burger itself was so good, we barely touched the side of fries- even though they come with a delicious garlic aioli that I couldn't get enough of.  \n\nHeads up, the menu seems to change pretty frequently and many of the dishes mentioned and shown in previous reviews are no longer available so don't get your heart set on any one thing. Service checked in on us frequently but didn't go over any specials and didn't seem up the same standards as at the other restaurants. Would come back to try the fish and chips or one of the pies."

When we saw him again my friend reminded him I was waiting for a box. He apologized and brought me one. My friend held up her credit card for at least 30 minutes trying to get our waitress to bring our check. Finally when the busser brought my to go box we asked him to get our waitress to bring our check. We noticed that a couple who were seated about the time we got our food had still not had anyone approach their table and take their order by the time we finally got our check.

We were happy with both choices.\n\nI started with the lobster rolls and my wife got the Caesar salad. The lobster rolls were subtly dressed and tasty, but two rolls the size of my fist for $18 seemed overpriced. The salad, on the other hand, was generously portioned; I wish the dressing had a more pronounced anchovy flavor, but it was very good (comparable to Macaroni Grill's dressing).\n\nThe main course blew us away. I got the The Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich, which looks like a standard fair reuben, but is better in every way from what you'd normally expect, from the bread to the quality of the meat to the phenomenal cucumber aioli. My wife got the Scottish Salmon, and I asked her why she was eating it so slowly. She told me that it was so delicious that she wanted to savor every bite.\n\nThe only misstep was the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which we got because we kept hearing how great it was. I really wish the server hadn't poured the insanely sweet toffee syrup over the top of it as part of the presentation. The tiny parts of the bread pudding that weren't soaked in the syrup were sweet and nicely balanced. Unfortunately, the sweetness of the syrup was so bad we couldn't eat more than a small nibble before having to take several gulps of coffee just to wash it down. We gave up after only a few small bites. If anyone from the restaurant reads this PLEASE consider keeping the syrup in the mini pitcher that you bring it out with, so the diner has an option to add it themselves."

As we were walking in, we heard a couple sending their food back. My family and I should've taken the hint and left right then.\n\nThey don't give you any bread, which for the price of basically $30 a plate I expected some. I got the salmon cooked \"medium\", but when it came, it was not only half the size of my palm but it was also raw. I felt like I was eating sushi. Not worth the price tag at all. My mom got a hamburger cooked \"well done\", but when it came, it was bloody and raw. When she sent it back, it came seared on the outside with the inside exactly the same. It was still raw and bloody. She sent it back a second time and told them not to bring it back. My brother got the scallops that were so flavorless he named it the worst he ever had. My dad's chicken was okay, but the mash potatoes he paid 11+ for were completely flavorless. \n\nThe only halfway decent thing I had was some French fries that were supposed to be truffle fries but only had salt on them..... Couldn't properly enjoy them though because both my and my mothers ketchup had strange black pieces of god knows what in them.\n\nHonestly save your money and go to mcdonalds if you want some fries."

The salty pretzel turned out to be three pretzel sticks, clearly pre-made, and not a single piece of salt to be found. The cheese deep looked like it just came out of the microwave and the mustard from the bottle. Not a very good start. The burger did not impress either. The meat, while very juicy, had no flavor, and I mean NONE. The fries are run of the mill.  I have had much, much better food at a local Red Robin, and it didn't cost me $36!!!!!!

Sadly GR Pub and Grill was the latter. \n\nI am a huge GR fan and was very excited in trying Mr. Ramsay's inspired menu and experience his detail to service. We arrived around 1:15pm for lunch and waited for a few mins while waitstaff cleared a table.  The restaurant was only about 1/4-1/2 full (at best) and yet we still had to wait about 10mins before a waiter poured our water and asked for drink orders.  I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it was waaaay too heavy on the rum and was not served with lime.  To the server's credit - he was very apologetic - rushed to get me a second one.  #2 Dark and stormy was slightly better (less rum)  but still a sub-standard drink which did NOT warrant the $11 price tag.  Again not served with lime - I had to ask for them.  Not.a.great start.  \n\nSo I thought 'ok -we are not here for drinks the food should really speak for itself'. We ordered the deviled eggs per the waiter's suggestion plus I LOVE deviled eggs. I was so psyched to see them on the menu.  I have been known to eat 8-10 in one seating but I digress. With all Mr. Ramsay's emphasis on simplicity - it was lost on this dish.  I thought it was interesting mix of flavors on paper but in reality there was too much going on between the vinegar, bacon and cheese.  Weird texture too with the bits of bacon. The worst was that the egg whites were too firm - like they had been sitting in the fridge for too long or were just pulled out and were not given enough time to soften a little. And the yolks simply did not taste fresh.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by farm fresh eggs.  Nevertheless I was disappointed.  \n\nAh but the entree should be better - right?  Nope.  My lamb burger arrived cold.  Cold fries and cold burger. WTF?! Not only did we wait approximately 15-20mins for the entrees to arrive but the my entire meal was cold.  COLD!  Again the waiter was very apologetic and rushed a second burger out to me.  So this one was warmer but sadly it had absolutely No.taste. None. Could not tell it was lamb.  In Mr. Ramsay's words: BLAND!.  It was not seasoned.  I've had better tasting lamb in the local middle eastern restaurant here in Pittsburgh.  I cannot speak to my mother's dish because it contained gluten but she said her heirloom tomato sandwich was quite good.  So there was one bright spot.  Then again she admits that she really does not care about food e.g. tastes, flavors, experience as much as I do.  \n\nIn conclusion, I had very high expectations for Mr. Ramsay's food and restaurant.  For the prices he charges I should have been WOWed.  Instead I left disappointed and very unhappy.  I do have to mention that the watier was thoughtful enough to offer a 20% employee discount which brought our lunch total to $59.02 but still a pricey sum for a sub-standard-will-not-return-to-lunch.  I would not recommend this place.  Sigh.  \n\nHappy Dining,\nKK Teh"

I had been looking forward to coming here as soon as we decided to go to Las Vegas, and had high expectations that just were not met. \n\nI'll start off with my one and only positive comment about this place the service was pretty good. They waiters were friendly and fairly attentive. \n\nNow to my laundry list of why this place was a major disappointment: \n1. The food was mediocre at best, and inedible at worst. I came in and thought \"hey I'm at Gordon Ramsey's Pub, I'll have the Fish 'n Chips. I bet they'll be fantastic!\". Wrong! It's more like Fish 'n Wedges..flavorless, unseasoned, & cold wedges. The fish was ok, but not  even note worthy. I've had better Fish 'n Chip's at the local Chippy at Brixham harbor..\n\n2. The prices were disproportional to the quality of the food..if you want me to be happy about paying $30 for Fish n Chips, and $5 for a diet Coke it had better be fricken amazing. It wasn't. \n\n3. The decor in that place is tacky, just awful. And the uniforms of the waiters boarders on bizarre. Whoever styled that restaurant has all they style and class of one of the local Las Vegas hookers."

Gambling, drinking, shopping, shows, good looking girls (and guys I suppose...), eating...the list goes on!\n\nSo on a Saturday afternoon, with the girls ditching us to spend the afternoon shopping at the Forum, the rest of us decided to have a boys afternoon out with snacks and beer.  Sure, it might not be something unique to Vegas, but it is when it's Gordon Ramsay's cooking!  Or perhaps, his most recent Hell's Kitchen winner, Ja'nel Witt? (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas#IX8KiLMIq2gdLA1YLH9qzA)\n\n-- DUCK CONFIT POUTINE - Hand-Cut French Fries, Duck Gravy, and Duck Confit...$13/$12**\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas#bK8tscNQn2pNWV4mGvk5gQ)\nIt may not have been the most authentic poutine (no cheese curds), but it was really good.  Though the fires could have been crispier, the cheese and duck formed this gooey deliciousness and the gravy added a ton of flavor.\n\n-- PUB \"SPOTS\" - Three Mini House Blend Pub Burgers, Wood-Grilled, Pub Burger Sauce, Welsh Cheddar Cheese 15/14**\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas#PaRgkpXefjqsJPBb5StThA)\nBased strictly on taste, it was pretty solid.  The patty had a nice char and the blend of meat was terrific.  We forgot to add the smoked applewood bacon, but it wasn't necessary.  That said, I wouldn't get this again simply because of price - essentially $5 per half dollar sized slider and the bacon would have been $3.00 more overall.\n\n**NOTE: Menu prices are slightly cheaper if you have a Total Rewards player's card.\n\nDespite the hefty price tag on the Pub Spots (pricey even for Vegas), I'd certainly come back to try an actual entr\u00e9e and to get another order of the Poutine.  And who knows, maybe I'll see Gordon Ramsay there...yelling about something."

I make a point to seek out new brews where ever I travel. The quantity of the beer selection at Ramsay's Pub was the sole reason my girlfriend and I made the trek for dinner that night. \n\nI was disappointed to find out that they do not have nearly this amount of beers for sale. They still have plenty (about 30-ish), but I was hoping to find something new, or perhaps a hard to find ale from when I used to live in London. If you visit hoping to drink some great craft brews, you will be let down. They stock the usual big brands, nothing special. Unless, of course, our server with-held some secret menu that contained the rest of the beers advertised on the website? I asked about this but was told everything they had was on the menu. :-(\n\nAs for the food, it's Vegas prices. High prices, almost too high for what they offer. I had the Steak and Ale pie, which is a staple of hearty pub food in the UK. But at $24, I suppose I expected something more than the underwhelming pie I received. I didn't think I would have to spice up a Gordon Ramsay pie with HP sauce... I've had better from UK chains like Fuller's. My girlfriend had the fish and chips, which were good, but still very expensive ($28) for what it is. \n\nAgain, I understand it's Vegas and prices are inflated, but it just seems like too much for the food they offer. They can advertise it as \"elevated\" pub food, but in the end it's still just pub food and doesn't justify a $75 bill for steak and ale pie, fish and chips, and two drinks (a full draft pint is anywhere from $9-$13). \n\nI originally gave it 2 stars because of high prices, generally underwhelming food, and missing beer. But, the food wasn't bad, just not worth the high prices. The place does, however, have a great vibe. Lots of fun, but I would reconsider dining here again. For the price, there are better options. In fact, hundreds of options! Maybe I'll just grab a brew or cocktail at the bar next time."

I have been to Gordon Ramsay Steak and it is amazing, so I knew right away where I wanted to go. I brought along 11 of my friends to share the experience.  The service is pretty fantastic. They all learn your name and take the time to chat, they even put on fake British accents when they heard us doing it. My water glass was never empty and they even had the entire restaurant sing happy birthday to me. There are two menus, the grill menu which is a bit pricier and the pub menu which has yummy pub food. We ordered off of the pub menu. Since we were such a large party, we tried a lot of food!\n\nFish and Chips - The fish is so buttery and melt in your mouth delicious! OMG! I didn't care so much for the garlic on the chips. I love garlic, but they tasted like they had been rubbed with raw garlic, not my favorite. \n\nShepherd's Pie - The mashed potatoes were so buttery delicious. Everything really worked well together, it was easy to see why this is a signature dish. \n\nDuck Poutine - The fries and the duck gravy were phenomenal. There were bits of duck that were a little overdone so didn't add much to the dish, maybe if they were cooked a little less it would have worked a little better.\n\nTrio of Pretzels with cheese and mustard - Two of us ordered this appetizer and the bacon cheese pretzel was fantastic! The mustard was a bit too spicy for my liking and the cheese spread it a little weird, but not too bad. This dish is not worth ordering because they bring the exact same thing to the table for free, except the free one has a small loaf of pumpernickel bread and butter instead of mustard. I can't believe they charge for this and then bring almost the exact same thing to the table for free. \n\nMac and Cheese - Almost everyone at the table ordered this and the response was 50/50. I was expecting a warm and rich mac and cheese, unfortunately, there was a really sharp cheese flavor which turned me off. \n\nShort rib and Cheek sandwich - My friend ordered this and passed it around the table. The meat was tender and delicious and there was a horseradish sauce that really added a kick.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding - You really must try this! It is absolutely delicious! Everyone at the table stole a bite and enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, there were a lot of hits and some misses. We did have one big thing that turned me off a little. My sister in law ordered a burger, they forgot the bacon and then the burger was almost raw. She sent it back and by the time they brought the new one everyone was finished eating. She asked them to just box it up since we were finished. I would have liked to see that taken off the check since she didn't even get to eat with everyone, unfortunately this didn't happen and I was not comfortable asking. \n\nThere are some great dishes on the menu, the restaurant has a really cool vibe, and the service was pretty good. This is definitely a cool hangout for some yummy upscale pub food, but Gordon Ramsay Steak is where it's really at!"

The service was just fine unlike other reviewers' negative experiences, but I find some of these overly chipper servers' rehearsed theatrical presentation of the menu quite annoying.

I've had fish and chips in many Irish and Enlish pubs, and this was fairly ordinary, which is OK with me, but $27 for fish and chips?  really?  \n\nLamb burger was juicy with good lamb flavor, but not anything I'd crave for anytime in the near future.  \n\nAll in all, I have to say that this place is A-ok.  Would I go back to hellish parking structure of Caesars Palace even if all of us locals know the back way from Dean Martin and pay for food that should cost 1/2 as much?  \n\nAs GR might say....\"no focking way\"...."

            "review": "I have to say I am a big Ramsay fan and so far the couple of Ramsay restaurants I have dined at have not let me down; and I am a fault-finding customer. With that being said, I am so surprise to see so many two and three star reviews here. Nevertheless I had to give it a go and form my own opinion. \n\nFrom the minute you walk in the door you can see that the decorator went above and beyond to provide the guest a \"pub\" experience.  Now it may not fit an authentic English Pub, but you're not in London, you're in Las Vegas and I found the setting to be perfectly fitting.  We sat in the dining room and found the wait staff was personable, attentive and quick with the drink. I will say that the menu held more than your traditional pub fare, but still offered classics like Bangers & Mash or Fish & Chips. \n\nFor the table we started with Hellfire Lollipop Wings, English Beer Steamed Clams and Maine Lobster Roll Minis.  As I sit here and write this review I still cannot think of one thing I would change about the starters. The wings were unique, they were crispy, sweet, spicy and savory all at the same time, I still regret not asking what chili pepper they used in the sauce - I would say these are in the Top Three best wings I have had.  The clams were exactly what I expected, perfectly cooked clams in a tasty broth with little pieces of chorizo and the lobster rolls were spot on, as if we had been sitting in a restaurant in downtown Bangor. \n\nFor main courses, two of us got the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish& Chips and the odd man out went with a Grilled Lamb Burger. Now I can speak to the burger but from what I could see and what I was told, it was juicy, flavorful and very filling. I almost wished I had ordered it.  The fish and chips were really good. The batter was light and crisp, the cod was perfectly prepared and flaky, it was simplicity at its best. I also enjoyed the different take on chips, as they were fried potato wedges and held up well against the malt vinegar without getting soggy. The one thing that brought it all together was the little ramekin of Minted Mushy Peas.... Delicious. \n\nAs I left Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill I remember rubbing my stomach and telling my friends what a good meal that was. I really enjoyed it.  Typically I would give the restaurant 5-Stars at this point, but because of the other lesser reviews I am wondering if there are some issues with consistency and therefore until I visit again I can only give them 4-Stars."

Everything costs more here especially on the strip.  Add to that the fact it's a Gordon Ramsey establishment and the cost ticks up.  But what did you expect?  Vegas, The Strip, Gordon Ramsey, and a $6 burger? Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion based on their experience.  We had a great time and everything we ate was excellent.  Could there be a little Ramsey bashing going on?  Why, you ask, if it was so good did I only give it 4 stars?  Well our server was excellent but that was the last staff member that was.  The hostesses are in need of training.  We were promptly seated only to be told several minutes later that there was no server on duty of that table (despite tables all around us being handled).  So we were moved and damn if it didn't happen again!  The third seating was a charm, however.  Unfortunately, it wasn't handled well.  Their staffing issues should not be experienced by the customer especially when they had what appeared to be plenty of staff on hand.  And yes, for the amount of money we spent you expect better service.  However, the problem wasn't the food!  I've lived in Vegas for many years and watch restaurants come and go.  All experience some growing pains.  I sincerely hope that this one grows out of theirs.  We'll go back expecting the same great food, higher than average prices, but much better service."

            "review": "In a nutshell: over-priced and awful service.\nA month ago, I came here with 3 girlfriends. I had decent expectations.\nWhile waiting at the bar for a table, 3 drinks got returned from the dining area to our bartender (who seemed new). The the servers were bluntly rude to the bartender about the drinks right in front of us. It was uncomfortable and customers shouldn't be around when an employee is getting scolded.\nThere was also a woman tending (who appeared to be training the bartender). She was snappy to him in front of us about checking our IDs after we had already been served (we are all nearing our 30's and he had indeed already checked all of our birthdays). She never smiled or acknowledged us. Again, it made us uncomfortable. \nThis woman took our tabs (as opposed to our bartender who had served us, laughed with us, been friendly, taken pictures, etc.) when it was time to sit at our table even though she had 0 communication with our party. She then shorted me money. It was a very small amount, but I was immediately irate because it had been an odd amount due to tax (I believe my total had been 5.36, I paid with $10) and I only got $4.50 in change back. I would understand if it was an odd amount, but I received 2 basic quarters. Nothing else. No odd pennies or nickels, just 2 quarters. It was CLEARLY wrong without even thinking about the math. It was pure laziness. She never even looked at us, just took our money and left. \nI did not want to leave a tip for risk this woman would steal it (after she'd already taken $.14 of my own) and I couldn't find our bartender to tip him directly. I boldly circled my \"change due\" section on my receipt since after we paid the woman never returned to our side of the bar and my party was already at a table. If our nice bartender ever reads this, I'm sorry I didn't tip you.\nOnce seated, it was very hot in our dining area. We were all sweating. Had the food made up for this, we could have looked past it. \nI ordered french onion soup and it had (what I hope was) a chunk of rock solid bone in it. We couldn't identify it. Why would there be anything hard in french onion soup? It was super disappointing because the soup was great until then.\nMy friend ordered sliders that were ok, slightly dry but ok.\nThe other 2 ordered the same thing: the burger. One rare, the other medium. When they were delivered at the same time looking identical, one girl clarified with the food runner that they had each gotten the correct burgers to the correct person: she guaranteed they had.\nThey were wrong. One bite in and each girl could tell they had the wrong one. They swapped, we were all friends, no big deal.\nUp until this point our dining service had been fast, attentive, and great. My water glass never stayed empty.\n When our server came around to ask how our food was, the 2 ladies told him about the burger swap. They wanted our server to know of the mistake so that it didn't happen to any other diners and risk the restaurant having to re-cook or clear a check for someone later on. They were professional and kind about it, and didn't expect anything besides acknowledgement that there had been a mistake.\n\nAfter bringing this to their attention, none stopped at our table again.\n\nWe had to stop a random busboy and tell him to get our checks after we'd been sitting, finished eating, for quite some time even though we were in the center of the dining room.\nThe check came out as 1 whole (not sure who they thought intended to pick up our entire $70 bill...maybe they should have given it to the bartender who shorted me) so we then had to wait for it to be separated. \n\nIt took longer to pay and leave than it did to order and eat. Overall it was our worst dining experience the whole time we were in LV."

            "review": "Anyone break their tooth eating the beet salad? \nI was there before the Shania Twain concert and ordered the beet salad that took well over 30 minutes to receive and we sat at the bar for faster service. On my second bite, I bit down on something very hard and realized something went very wrong in my mouth. The waiter, Adam, just happened to be looking at me and asking how was our food. I'm shaking by head NO and pulling the salad out of my mouth to see what was in it and found a very hard object like a rock. Then, I realized it had also broken my molar and ran to the bathroom to see the damage. It was so dark, I couldn't tell but touched the area with my finger and the nerve was exposed and sent me a zap through my body with pain. They called the EMT to write up the incident report, but by now the concert was starting in 5 minutes. We ran to the concert with my mouth in pain and came back to the Pub & Grill after the concert to meet with the EMT again to fill out the paperwork. Even the manager said, it was chewing on a rock and we also found many more smaller pieces in the salad. I had to wait until the next morning to get emergency dental care and found out I would need a crown after the temporary fix in Vegas. I ended up in bed all day with a headache, ruined vacation, missed event, and alot of pain, novocaine, and drilling...no fun!  \nLong story short, I was supposed to hear from Caesar's within 3 days...never happened! I called them to find out it had been passed on to CCMSI, a law firm who takes care of their injury claims. I was told they mailed me a letter...never got it. I was told they emailed me...never got it until I called again. They never ever asked me for any information or details of the incidence except the simple form of what happened that night and my 2 dental bills. The manager had indicated to keep track of my auto expenses to and from dentist...they had no idea and never asked how much this affected my life. After not hearing from them again for weeks, I kept calling. Finally, two weeks ago the assistant got back on the phone and informed me the supervisor decided they were not honoring the claim because they didn't consider the nut shell or whatever it was to be a \"foreign object.\" I was shocked!!! \nAll I could think of was if Gordon Ramsay was filming a Hell's Kitchen episode and during the tasting time of judging personally ate the \"foreign object\", broke his tooth off, and swallowed a piece of his molar, would that be acceptable? I've also reached out to his company in London to NO AVAIL with an email to his press department and a message to his facebook page. They have no other email for coorespondence, except to call a London phone number.  \nAfter I called Caesar's again to let them know CCMSI had denied the claim, they offered to just pay my two dental bills for my broken tooth. Really? How about the  lost 4 days of my life, lost work, lost vacation, novocaine-drilling-crown for the rest of my life, auto expenses, not to mention all the pain and time it's taken to deal with CCMSI who has not represented Caesar's well at all. Here's the icing on the cake...there's another review in July, 5 weeks after my incident, with the same report of a shell or foreign object in the beet salad at Pub & Grill and he thought it cracked his tooth, but didn't. He even posted a pic with his review of the \"foreign object\". You would have thought the rock-like nutshell or whatever it is, would have been taken care of when it happened to me in such a big way. Obviously it hasn't. Now I'm talking with an attorney to get this resolved and I'm not a sue-happy person. Please message me if you've had a similar experience. \nGordon, as a business owner also, if you don't know about this, you should! Your name, personal reputation, Hell's Kitchen, and Food Network's reputation is on the line!! This was my experience from Hell and I wasn't even in the Kitchen!!!"

They send you a text when your table is ready which was better than having to sit around and wait or carry a pager, so we were able to play some slots while we waited.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little different, you feel more like you are in someone's house for dinner rather than a restaurant, it's a little odd, but it works. Something I have noticed in Gordon Ramsay's restaurants is that the servers all seem a little, under dressed, but our server was attentive and knew all about the menu.\n\nWe tried the pretzel bread that came before the meal and the cheese sauce it came with was great. A nice blend of cheese and spice, it really worked. We ordered the Shepard's pie and the mac and cheese which was not on the dinner menu, but if you ask for it, you can have it. Both dishes were delicious! My husband said it was the best Shepard's pie he ever had and the mac and cheese was amazing! It was creamy and had many levels of flavor, definitely the most complex mac and cheese that I had ever eaten. Also, don't be fooled by what appear to be small portion sizes, they are actually quite filling.\n\nFor dessert we had to try the much talked about sticky toffee pudding and it did not disappoint. The cake was warm and soft, paired perfectly with creamy ice cream and caramel. It was enough to share for two people.\n\nThe service overall wasn't quick, but it wasn't bad either. The couple behind us were waiting for their food when we got there and still didn't have it when we were done. I don't know what they ordered, but they seemed to be waiting a long time for it. Overall I would definitely come back to try more of the menu, it was a nice experience."

I booked a month in advance for a party of 6, expecting a dining table or booth. Instead we were shown to a high top bar table with stools in a crowded, extremely (shouting to each other to talk) bar. Nothing else available we were told. Server took ten minutes to acknowledge us. Drinks were offered. Another ten minutes passed before we were able to order. While the appetizer of mildly hot and sweet wings was good, the rest of the meal went downhill. Two diners ordered Shepard's Pie, mediocre reviews. Lobster Mac & Cheese first course was over price at approx $22 ($24?) dollars and missing lobster. Two diners ordered the organic chicken dish. When dinner was served, after an almost 40 minute wait, the Organic chicken turned out to be Bangers and Mash. When this was called to our servers attention, he said (and I quote), \"Oh, the button for the Organic Chicken is beside the Bangers and Mash, I must have pushed the wrong button.\" When we advised just to take the plates and we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for our entree he offered to bring us a Shepards Pie (which they must have made ahead and keep ready under warmers?) Since neither of us eat red meat this was not an option. Our table asked for salt and pepper four times before it was brought, after dinner was essentially over. Our consolation for no dinner? Our server grudgingly offered dessert \"on him\". Incidentally, while no one could remember to bring condiments, they did manage to return to the table four times to refill drink orders from the bar, thus goosing up the check to the best of their ability. Terrible, terrible service and Chef should be appalled. No manager approached or offered apologies. I left a 10% tip, my husband, who is usually overgenerous with tips, wanted to leave nothing. We will not return to Gordon Ramsay' Pub."

There is a food court in Caesars that has what you would find at most mall food courts with a higher price.\n\nSeeing as I had done pretty well during my stay I decided instead to try something more substantial. SO I selected the Pub and Grill. \n\nI was more than pleased with my selection. Being a big fan of a the traditional Reuben Sandwich I jumped at the bartenders recommendation of the Dubliner.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=L6eTYEfU4s3hE-3XWe7mEA#jT7C1Zt9bL1IOQBYg6bN9A\n\nThey basically chop the well seasoned corned beef into small bite sized cubes and layer them with the sauerkraut and the cheese inside an awesome toasty bread bowl. HOLY CRAP, it was delicious. It was paired with a delicious thousand island dressing and some \"Chips\" that were out of this world. \n\nI will admit that by Vegas Haute Cuisine standards this lunch was fairly pedestrian but it gets a five from me for creativity, taste, preparation, and out standing service. A special shout out to Bartender/ server Ray Ray, Dude your recommendation rocked."

He too was very attentive and nice.  Throughout our meal, he continuously came to check up on us and ensure we were having a good time and that there were no problems with anything.   He truly made the meal and experience much more enjoyable. I've been to many many restaurants and have never met a more congenial, friendly, and attentive manager.  \n\nAs for the food, it was delicious! The scotch egg was paired with an amazing sauce. The lobster Mac and cheese was nice and rich.  The chicken pesto pistaccio sandwich was a great blend of flavor.  The steak and ale pie was super flavorful.  The sticky toffee pudding was extremely good. The pudding was my favorite and highly recommended; especially if you like sweets!\n\nOverall, highly recommended.  We would definitely return for the food and great service. Thanks again Randy for an amazing experience."

If your place has pub in its name and numerous televisions you should expect people may get the idea they can enjoy a game there.  \n\nI thought it may have been because we asked to switch tables (something I don't do normally) in order to see the game, but the table next to us has the same problem with the server."

Service was also pretty good aside from the one major issue of the night, menus (minus 1 star).  There were 4 people in our party and we had three menus showing one price and one menu that was about $10 higher per entree.  It is a big difference if the Shepard's pie is $25 or $16.  We asked about the price difference and the server immediately took away the expensive menu, but it makes me wonder...  The food was all great.  Portion sizes were average for the Shepard's pie, large for the pork chop, and VERY tiny for the lamb riblettes appetizer.   Beer selection was great including a dry English cider.  Sticky toffee pudding was very good served in a traditional fashion with plenty of sauce.   Value was reasonable for Vegas standards using the prices on the cheaper menu.  I will happily return as long as the expensive menu prices don't take effect."

I almost wish I hadn't as it has given me a jaded view of one of my culinary heroes.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were escorted to our seats and immediately brought water by a very warm and welcoming waiter. The menu was very broad and seemingly had something for everyone. For what it was, prices were a little on the high side, but as we are on vacation, we ordered and that's where things began to slip.\n\nMy girlfriend and I both opted for the chicken madras, my mum got the bangers and mash and dad went for the fish and chips. We were all waiting in anticipation to finally try some of Ramsay's British pub classics. The wait, however, was sadly much longer than anticipated. We clocked around 35 minutes sitting talking at the table before our food finally arrived. At this point, the waiter dropped the fish and chips all over the floor. Without a word, he cleaned the plate up and went back to the kitchen. We were waiting for 5 more minutes before our allocated waiter even recognised a plate was missing and no apology was given, simply a \"at least one made it\" when the second dish was delivered. \n\nThe food itself was actually delicious from what I had, which is perhaps the only thing keeping this review above 2 stars. The curry had excellent heat and flavour to it and was warm throughout. The bangers and mash were a hit as well, although it should be noted that the sausages are 3 different meats, so if you're not a fan of beef, chicken or pork sausage, I'm sure they would substitute to your preference. As for the fish and chips, it looked good and had crispy batter, however, I had expected it to be more like chip shop style chips from the UK rather than French fries.\n\nI believe this place has potential to be great, but could do with some more training for the wait staff. I hope the next time that Mr Ramsay checks in to this part of his empire that he recognises the need for improvement."

I tried to eat the rest of the burger and the meat was almost too gamey to eat. I know some lamb meat has that flavor characteristic, but this was bad. I've had a good lamb burger before and I can assure you this isn't it.

Since i was a party of one again, i was ushered to the bar to have my dinner. \n\nI ordered a fish and chips, it was supposed to be a \"classic favourite\" so i assumed it should be good. Boy i couldn't be more wrong. I also ordered a innis and gunn which was supposed to \"pair well\"  with the fish and chips and was \"gordon's\" favourite. \n\nThe fish and chips came in a bowl shaped plate on a piece of fancy tracing paper. The fish and chips were nicely done. The huge chunks of cod were very very fresh(gotta give it to them) and cooked perfectly. However, without the tartar sauce and the lemon, the fried fish was disgustingly plain, the fried batter came off the fish completely and i was eating fried batter separately from the fish. \"the entire plate was so oily, that the USA is deciding to invade the plate\" was how i felt after eating this 30 dollar dish. \n\nThe innis and gunn did its job, the only 2 reasons why i could think of why it paired so well with the dish is because it washes the grease away from your palate, and if you have enough glasses of this beer, you would probably get drunk enough to forget you had paid 30 bucks for a disgusting, oily plate of cod fish, fried batter and chips. \n\nI was so disappointed by my experience at GR pub and grill i didn't even post it on my facebook.

I wouldn't turn this place down if given the opportunity...but then again, I wouldn't volunteer this place either given the choice."

I was glad we made reservations on Opentable along the way. We were seated right away in the back of the restaurant where it was more quiet. Our waiter's name was Adam and he was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the deviled eggs, corn soup, baby greens salad, and the ham and cheese sandwich, all of which I would highly recommend. Everything was very fresh looking and tasting as well as perfectly prepared. I am really looking forward to returning here for another casual but delicious meal. My only complaint is they marked us as a no show on Opentable, but hopefully this will be resolved on their end, as we have already taken it up with Opentable."

Everything we had was delicious.  \nThe portions are small so no sharing is advised. Another word of advise for the restaurant manager and the lady patrons that walk in with heels.... Hold on to a rail for dear life.  I almost fell three times on my way to our table.  At first I thought it was my shoes but after witnessing 2 lady guest fall in front of my table at different times while we had dinner, there was no doubt in my mind....

Showed up at 10:05 and was then told only accepting walk ins after 11 by an uninterested hostess. Told them i spoke to Nina who was right next to her and she said that these were just guideline responses. Nana acknowledged that she had spoken to me but both answers were accurate. Wtf!\nThey said there was no specific wait time but i could wait at the bar.

The staff at the door & the bar were friendly, helpful and highly recommended. The drinks menu is good too and the Bar Crawl cocktail was delicious. We sat at the bar as there was a 30 minute wait for a table at 19:15 on a Saturday evening (to be expected). This was fine and made for a great experience as we got to chat to the bar staff and watch some sports on tv.\n\nWe ordered the lamb burger, cheese burger, cauliflower cheese and sprouts. It was all cold and my cheese burger was really dry and inedible. I sent it back as I just couldn't eat it. It was so poor we didn't want to risk ordering dessert. I think GR would go mad if he came here on Kitchen Nightmares and tried the food! He needs to sort it out or take his name off it. Do not come here. It's really poor."

We had dinner the other night and everything we ordered was phenomenal.  \nFor apps we had Pretzel Sticks and Onion Rings.  My ten year old, who doesn't eat onions, tried an onion ring and gave a thumbs up.  The pretzel sticks were soft on the inside with a dark, chewy exterior.  Delicious!\nOur main courses were the Fish and Chips, Hell's Kitchen Ghost Pepper Burger and a Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The light crispy batter on the fish was out of this world.  Chips were seasoned wedge-ish shapes, crispy outside and soft inside, yum.  I had the Ghost Pepper burger and was delightfully pleased with the heat level, knowing it wouldn't be crazy hot for the masses and hopeful it would have a nice bite.  The after-burn was perfect.  Chicken Pesto was delicious as well.\nDessert we had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding at the suggestion of the waiter, knowing full well they push certain dishes but he didn't steer us wrong with the appetizers.  OMG!!!  When we got back to our room I immediately began searching for recipes (still haven't tried it though).  The Sticky Toffee Pudding is to DIE for, I have no more words.  Just thinking about makes my mouth water.  Ok.\nOur waiter was great, staff makes the experience.  He took our order with no notes and we all received exactly what we ordered.  I was in the mood for a cocktail and asked for his recommendation and he brought me a drink with blackberry and something else.  I don't remember, but it was super tasty.  Not too sweet with whatever alcohol in the background.\nIf we lived closer I would definitely go back and tell all my friends about it (I'll do that anyway).  Two thumbs WAY up!"

The chips were way too thin, they looked dull and grey (must have used the wrong type of potatoes) and the fish and batter were totally tasteless and if anything left an oily aftertaste. The mushy peas were the best part of the meal but they were only garden peas that someone had halfheartedly squished a bit. Total waste of time and money. Just find a British or Irish pub in Vegas instead of going here."

The service, on the other hand, was terrible. \n\nWe're staying in Nobu and wanted lunch after getting into Vegas; this place is super conveniently located, and you can walk straight out and gamble. \n\nWe got here at around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. It took our waiter, Michael, about 10 minutes to come introduce himself, and while the restaurant was busy, it was far from packed. We wanted to do a preemptive strike against the long night ahead, and ordered waters, which was when our waiter seemed to \"size\" us up. We're a mid-twenties couple, which in LA doesn't really have any bearing on the service we receive, but Michael definitely treated us differently from the older patrons around us. \n\nWe decided to start with some of the happy hour appetizers, and went with the pub nachos and hellfire wings. Both were AMAZING, and I would gladly come back for them. The pub nachos were a surprisingly large portion, and everything was fresh and cheesy and flavorful, without being greasy or too heavy, a surprising feat for kettle potato chips, pub cheese, and a ton of brisket. The wings were some of the best I've ever had; I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but the blue cheese sauce served with them was divine and the sauce they were tossed in was wonderful. Easily 5/5 on both of those. When we ordered these, though, our waiter took our menus and almost sprinted away, never asking if we were going to order more or not. \n\nOur waiter didn't drop our appetizers himself, and he didn't come to check on us a single time while we were eating. We were planning to order more food, and my husband had to flag him down after about 20 minutes of him walking by us constantly, standing at the bar, and talking to other patrons. It was so blatant it was almost comical, except for the fact that we were paying customers. \n\nWhen we finally got his attention, we ordered the steak and ale pie to split. It came out piping hot (literally), and was delicious. The ale came through in the savory broth, which was loaded with steak and fresh mushrooms, and the crust was crispy, soft heaven. \n\n\nAgain, our waiter never came to check on us while we were eating and didn't drop the food himself. After about 20 more minutes he brought us dessert menus, since we apparently now seemed like people who came to a restaurant to order food, but I was so annoyed at this point I was ready to leave. \n\nThis waiter was not in the weeds, the restaurant didn't have a wait, and I watched him provide basic service to other tables. I don't know if it's our age or what, but being ignored isn't something I typically pay for. I tipped him 15%, very low for us, and I maintain I would've been better taking that money to the roulette table. The food will bring us back, but we'll likely get it to-go."

I have a feeling that if he had chosen to be a chef he would have been as equally skilled as he is with spirits.\n\nHe has a collection of house made infusions and bitters that he uses as tools to create some very unique, next level cocktails but can also make you one of the best classic cocktails you've ever tasted as well. I had one or two cocktails listed on the menu but I was entirely comfortable just asking Adam to shoot from the hip and make me something unique. Every cocktail was a success. I did have the \"God Save the Queen\" off the menu and it was pretty tasty, everything else was a Rains original I believe. I go here for the cocktails, the food is secondary to me but I have never had a bad experience. \n\nThat being said, I have never had anything bad here, it's just everything seems so heavy. I know I know English Pub fare. I'm not flaming the food but we normally just get smaller plates throughout the course of the night at multiple restaurants and would like to see lighter options other than salad. They did  add a couple of lighter option since my last trip, the lobster roll being one of them. It was delicious, light, sweet, savory, one of the best lobster rolls I've had. We also had the wings which were wings and the pub sliders that were pretty good although we were sad to see that they changed the recipe for their deviled eggs though. The last incarnation were the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten. \n\nIn the end, it's a great place to grab an early cocktail and a snack as they open at 11am and while I have never had anything truly amazing off the food menu it's definitely worth a stop if you want to try a Ramsay property without spending an arm and a leg or if you want to have an amazing cocktail."

While the chicken was tender and the curry was decent, the basmati rice was actually one of my favorite parts of the dish. The naan was a pretty charred (which the boyfriend actually loved... Me, not so much) and the yogurt tasted like it was just plain yogurt with a bit of citrus.  I'd take lower-quality Indian buffet food over this for a fraction of the price. \n\nThe charcuterie board came with slightly more than a single serving of each item and the cheeses of the night were a Cabot cheddar (wait, can't I get a while block of this at the store?) and what I think was a drunken goat cheese... Something that sounded oddly close to a featured cheese they had at Trader Joe's the other day... \n\nOver all not impressed. Kind of a let down for such a big name. What a gimmick."

The food game out quickly and correct. The ambiance is nice. People watching from the railing tables was amazing. \nFood: I ordered the bangers and mash and it was wonderful. I see a lot of complaints about the portion but it was a nice size. No need for you to have a feeding trough amount of food. The mash was full of flavor and was perfect texture. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and it was out of this world! \nMy husband ordered the 14 oz ribeye and it was cooked to perfection and needed none of the sauce choices. He ordered his sauce on the side and never needed to touch it since the steak stood perfect alone. \n\nSo yes it's expensive but don't go to any restaurant on the strip and expect McDonald's prices for a buffet amount of food....\nI highly recommend the pub if you want a awesome meal."

Manager Randy G. totally rocks when it comes to hospitality.  We had the pleasure of meeting him during our first visit and he actually remembered us when we returned a year later.

After waiting 30-minutes for a table of 7, we were ushered to a table with bar stools! They were cushioned, but when I sat down I sunk into the stool and felt like a toddler in a high chair. The first thing I noticed on the menu were the prices! Holy cow! Very pricey! The 2nd thing I noticed was the menu was limited. I decided to just drink water and my hubby and I split a 14oz steak for $38. It came with asparagus.. That's it! No salad. No soup. I can get a way better meal for the same amount at Berns Steak house here in Tampa. But this is Vegas. We ended up ordering the cheesy cauliflower also. As for the taste, the steak was quite tasty and I did enjoy it. The asparagus was average and the cauliflower was tasty.  Would I come here again? Maybe if I was going to watch a sporting event for drinks and split an appetizer but there are too many other choices in Vegas."

Love the interior design and the place was packed with a 15 minute wait! We sat at the bar Matt was awesome. Place mats are very English pub looking... Love the plate presentation.\n\nthe selection of draft beers is fantastic. they even offer a draft hard apple and pear ciders. the pear was amazing and Matt was happy to let me try a sample of the apple as well.\n\nWe started with the duck poutine and the warm pretzels. Pretzels were wonderful and the English mustard was super spicy and delicious. Duck poutine was good but not a lot of confit for the price.\n\nFish and Chips was a mixed bag. the fish was excellent, cooked perfectly with a great malt vinegar presentation. We did not care for the \"Chips\" the french fries served witht he Poutine were much better.\n\nSticky toffee pudding an excellent. Peanut butter and Jelly dessert needed work. If I am in the Forum SHops or going to an event/show at Caeser's I will be back.\n\nLots of great things on the menu I still want to try.\n\nThe dual pricing Regular menu price/Harrah's club member pricing truly INSULTING and fit for a Casino buffet not a world class chef"

She wanted to go to the Pub, BurgR, the Steakhouse, and any other taco stand or dumpling house he might open next week.\n\nI think I can best sum up the experience with a what I liked vs what I didn't like list:\n\nI liked that is was not a stuffy restaurant.  The atmosphere and decor was fun and inviting.\nI liked the non traditional table I was at with 2 large, cushy chairs on one side, and a couch on the other (you might not like this)\nI liked the huge beer list.\nI really liked my lamb chops.  The food got high marks by everyone at the table for quality and prep.\n\nI did not like the drink list on the ipad.  It did lead to some great conversation about if we though we could get away with stealing the Ipad...but, with 4 of us at the table, and only 1 Ipad, it was a rush job to look thru the 100+ beers separate onto different web pages by category.  In the interest of time, I just picked an old, well known favorite vs. something rare or reading up and trying something new.\n\n...and finally, what killed the experience...the serving size.  Upon looking at all the dinners as they came out, my initial though was, 'they know we did not order of the kiddie menu, right?'  While my lamb chops were great, there was only 4 lil chops for a serious price.  By contrast, Firefly, a well known local tapas restaurant, offers a $10 tapas plate with 2-3 pieces, and while maybe not as awesomely seasoned, it's still very good over there.  My Irish buddy got the Sheppards pie, and while he admitted it might be better than what momma made him...the size of it was seriously laughable.  I was not surprised when I heard he picked up more to eat.\n\nAs for that drink Ipad...Our best idea was to list it on Craigslist and sell it for cheap for immediate cash only, with an exchange in the bathroom, and quickly paying the tab in cash...and defiantly not returning to Caesars on this trip.  I'm just saying, if you ever see it on craigslist, don't go buy an Ipad from a guy in the mens room of Ramsay's Pub & Grill, it might some other guy with a clever but flawed idea."

There are just so many fantastic restaurants here, and they're all pretty much walking distance from one another.\n\nI've been here twice now. This last time, I was here for a convention, and actually favored going to Mesa Grill, however, the wait was ridiculous, so Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill it was.\n\nI digress, onto the food.\n\nI've had their grilled beef burger as well as their grilled lamb burger. My issue with their burgers is mostly their bun. It could stand being a bit more fresh. It's on the drier, crumbly side. Maybe people just don't order enough burgers here, so their bread doesn't move as fast? For a burger at the $20 mark, it should pretty much be flawless. Their fries are good, and the patties themselves are great.\n\nFor a much, much better overall burger, go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, located inside Planet Hollywood.\n\nService is spot on, and the interior looks great.\n\nFood: 2\nAmbience: 5\nService: 5\nValue: 2"

Hells Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, and the like but by far my favorite has always been 'the F word'. Now maybe it's because he has all those shows and how critical he is that we are eager to experience a GR restaurant! And of course he did not make my meal today and anytime you build large restaurants (franchises) then there will always be some loss of fidelity. Having said that - I was excited to try the pub here. First of all if you're gonna name it a Pub your prices shouldn't reflect that of 5 star steak house. That aside (it's Vegas - inside Caesars after all). I ordered a beer and an app at the bar oh and a water. The calamari I ordered was dreadful - it tasted more like deep fried salt pellets, which is to say that someone dumped so much salt on this dish that I'll not be tasting anything for the next 3 days. The only saving grace was the awesome water that came in a clean as opposed to my $11 pint of peroni which didn't. See picture of water below.  \nDare I say that Gordon or his staff failed in the hiring of the staff for this place - and perhaps has gotten a little smitten with himself and lost touch a little because the decor and staff uniforms are just pretentious wank! Maybe he should put this place on restaurant nightmares or get kitchen crashed or something. Sorry but being spread as thin as he is is no excuse it still falls on his rep - this place....FAIL! I would give a half more star if I could for the staff courtesy in dealing with my shocking food and delivering great H2o."

For a restaurant with this namesake, I expected a much better experience than what we got, especially if it's going to be $120 lunch.\nAfter being seating by the hostess we waited for about 10 minutes for our waiter to greet us. Even then, I'm not sure he would have if he hadn't  noticed my girlfriend grab a glass bottle of water from a nearby bucket to at least start to quench our thirst. Then, when he came over, he stole the bottle of water from us, despite the fact we said we were very thirsty and needed lots of water. He seemed surprised and unprepared that we were ready to order, but took our order.\n\"We'll start with the mini lobster roll appetizer and then 2 orders of fish & chips please with an iced tea to drink.\" He then disappeared again and about one minute (now they're fast?) later our delicious (5 stars) mini lobster rolls showed up via a stranger, not our waiter and were consumed. Our fish & chips came soon after, also delivered by a different stranger, and while not as good as the appetizer the fish and tartar were good (4 stars) the chips were burnt on the outside and raw inside ( NO STARS ). \nThe waiter never checked on us and we felt inclined to ask the random people delivering food to us for help, which they did for some things. Even telling the waiter that we wanted to order dessert. \"Sticky Toffee Pudding\" (3 stars) and a double espresso (2 stars). Our bill for lunch was about $110 - we left only a $10 tip which I wish the random strangers would get not our absentee server. I had intended on trying Gordon's BurGr restaurant"

First let me tell you in was excited to eat here as I am a fan of Chef Ramseys attention to detail and search for excellence.  So I was expecting great things. \n\nThe calamari was light and tasty nice seasoning and sauces were good. We were off to a good start. For a main course I had the new York strip. I ordered it medium and it came medium well. Still it was very good and the sauce was nice. The potatoes that came with it were cold and not seasoned. The other veggies on the plate cold. I tried the chicken pot pie and it was not bad not great. \n\nDessert was a sundae. Waiter didn't recommend anything. It was average sundae nothing special. I think the place is not bad not great better than an average pub but not what I would have expected from someone so demanding of excellence."

Menu was very different from anywhere else in town. \n\nDecor is VERY VERY COOL! Very Modern British PUB!\n\nIt seemed to me to be simply a very special place that is going to bud into an elite restaurant over this next year, being that it just opened. \n\nI've read some of the other reviews and find some of them quite funny. I don't know about you, but I don't go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant for the Coke? Or the pepper for that matter. LOL. \n\nThe hostesses Maria and Karen, were sweet, one took the info and the other pleasantly showed me to the bar.\n\n I ate the Beef Cheek and Short Rib Sandwich. Hands down the best sandwich I have ever eaten at a restaurant. So tender it melted in my mouth. Good flavors and sauces. It was obviously carefully created by a top chef. The fries were ginormous, but it was fun for a change. Even fry addicts like me enjoy a variation once in a while. \n\nThe service was great. Gene took really good care of me. He got my order right away despite having a near full bar. Food came out very fast. Gene seemed sincerely interested in giving me a great experience and frequently checked back. To ask how I liked it. He was quick with the beers and had a smile the whole time. \n\nThe bar did seem a bit messy through-out. Piles of napkins and crumbs and what not. But not a big turn off but would expect it to be cleaner. \n\nA manager did stop by (Eva.. Evie..Eve) to kindly check up to make sure everything was good. It was nice because I did not expect it sitting at the bar. \n\nI plan to come back frequently to this place. Seems like a good spot to hang out. Prices all seemed reasonable to me. I will gladly pay more for better product (duh!). \n\n\nNow good part. They have like 84 beers at this place. I will update it in the future. Here's what I recognized and remember from the beer list: \nInnis and Gunn\nBlue Moon\nCoorslight\nMiller Lite\nPyrmid\nStella\nMagic 9\nMoa Method\nBoddingtons\nGuinness\nStrong Bow\nBass\n\nDelerious Tremmens\nDuvel\nChimay (blue and Red)\nCorona\nHenry Wienharts\nHeiniken\nHeiniken lite\nJohn Henry 3 Lik spiker\nBelhaven\nFuli\nDogfish head 90\nBallast Point\nMeantime Coffee something\nChocolate Stout"

Common Gordon - whip these underling's butts into shape - please.\n\nWe started with the lobster-rolls for 21 bucks - for 2 small ones. And when I say SMALL --- they were essential common dinner rolls with a tablespoon of so-so lobster salad (or should I lobstery say celery salad) on top (not even in it). This would have been one of my grunge snacks in college when I was going to school in Boston, using left-overs from my dad's dinner visit the night before, and some hamburger bun from the pantry. Gordon! GORDON!\n\nThe best dish I had was the pea soup with cr\u00e8me fresh - a little watery but tasty. At least tasty in light of things.\n\nMy companion and I had hoped that things would go up from here - however - the truffle fries were oily, mushy and Luke warm (obviously left under a heat lamp for too long) ... the fish was over cooked and the breading fell off too easily (obviously under the same heat lamp no doubt). ... and the minted mashed peas were cold (I was really looking forward to these too).\n\nTotal bill for all this (a couple of appetizers and one main course to split) was around a hundred bucks.\n\nSAD\n\nLuckily I Bitched loudly - and the very nice manager gave me a discount on the bill, and a free dessert (a really tasty sticky toffee pudding - the best thing that we had here). So come here for dessert and get the pudding: it is served at room temperature and comes out of a big common pan - so no immediate cook-prep required. The theory - like in the army - keep things simple.\n\nWhen I went to the bathroom (not because of the food) I noticed that there are hundreds of seats here - many of them full - and the food rushes out quickly to them all - so obviously the kitchen prepares their dishes more like TGI Friday's rather than Gordon Ramsay Steak: fast and finished quickly. But at TGI Friday' you get what you pay for.... and at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill: YOU DON'T."

I could only finish half of it. \n- Our server was really nice and gave us free pens at the end of our meal (sucker for free stuff..)\n\nCons... one kinda big con actually....\n- When we arrived we had no reservations, BUT we saw the entire front section was open with about 15 tables or so. However, when we asked for a table, they told us there was a 30 minute wait...but their were tons of available tables... none the less we were all hot and tired and decided to just wait it out and ended up only waiting 15 minutes, but still...you would think with all those available tables they could give our small group of 4 one table. Guess they were ALL reserved since on our way out the tables were still empty."

We started off with the Pretzel Appetizer - not any better than any other pretzel appetizer you could get at any sit-down restaurant. We then ordered the scallops, mashed potatoes and lobster mac & cheese.\n\nScallops - they were cooked decently, but surprised by how tasteless and bland they were\nMashed Potatoes - Very tasty and very lumpy, but in a charming way\nLobster Mac & Cheese - Not as tasty as I was hoping. Was even more disappointed when I CHOKED ON PIECES OF LOBSTER SHELL in my food.\n\nI did notify the server about the shells who then spoke with one of her bosses not more than 5 feet from me who said they didn't shuck the lobster from the shell, but that it comes pre-done. Now there are 2 things that really bother me about this situation: 1) I paid $27 for Lobster Mac & Cheese and it appears that quality is not a priority for this restaurant. 2) The manager didn't even take the time to come and apologize to me. I wasn't expecting this to be comp'd, but an apology for serving me lobster shells in a dish that is supposed to be void of it I think merits at least an apology."

            "review": "This place was very yummy! I was excited to come here because I have been to the other two Gordan Ramsay restaurants in Vegas and wanted to dine at this one as well. I met to co-workers there and it was a nice place to sit and chat since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I loved our waiter. He was really nice and made recommendations for us when I asked. It did take a while to have the food come out but since we were talking a lot we didn't mind.\n\nI started dinner off with a cocktail. I had the spiced cider which was amazinggg. If you like any kind of ciders or if apples are your favorite fruit get this drink. It was very tasty. I also loved that they brought out pretzels and bread as a free appetizer. They give you a roll and three different kinds of pretzels along with a horse radish cheese dip and butter. Amazing and a great touch to the start of the meal. I got the Beef Cheek stew because our waiter said that if you wanted to try something different to eat that. I really enjoyed it. The beef was so so tender, maybe just a bit on the salty side. I was surprised because it wasn't so much of a stew as it was just beef with potatoes and veggies. I still enjoyed it though-I love when my beef is tender. We also got a side of the Yukon potatoes. They were great and went really well with the beef. I would get these as a side again. Then for dessert we had the chocolate dessert. I forget what its called but it has three different kinds of chocolate mousse in between chocolate cake and topped with whipped cream and chocolate caiver. It's served in a mason jar which I thought was cute. It was Delicious! And my favorite part of the meal (of course). I would get this again.\n\nI really liked this restaurant and would go here again. The next time I plan on getting the mini sliders because I noticed a ton of people got them and they looked amazing! I also want to try the French Onion Soup. Excited to go back soon! :)"

            "review": "Kitchen Nightmare\nI took a few days off last week to celebrate yet another year getting away from me. My wife and I went to Vegas, not for the gambling but for the entertainment and food. We stayed at Caesars Palace and one evening we thought we'd try the \"Gastro Pub\" experience offered by none other than Brit Bad Boy, Gordon Ramsay. Truth be told, although I love to cook, I'm not a huge fan of cooking shows, and shows where Mr. Ramsay makes a buck by humiliating what are often hardworking (albeit out of their depth) restaurateurs I find less than edifying. As a fellow reasonably foul-mouthed Brit bad boy who has been known to yell on occasion, maybe I just find it too close for comfort.\n\nIn any event, I love good Pub Grub so we gave it a shot. In their defense, the beer menu was excellent and the chips (French Fries for our US cousins) were authentically soggy and British... but beyond that, the food was just horrible... by far the worst we had all week. What was especially galling was the pretense that this was in some way Great British cuisine. Let's all agree on something... much (if not most) British food is horrible... really horrible. It's food made by poor people from less than great ingredients, typically over cooked under spiced and dull. It may have won us the British Empire... but it would get one star on Yelp on a good day. It is possible to do British staple dishes really well, with great ingredients and proper care Bangers and Mash or Fish and Chips can be killer... that's what's behind the current craze of \"Gastro Pubs.\" Unfortunately, done poorly Brit Grub just sucks... as did the Fare at Mr. Ramsay's Caesars Palace joint.\n\nTo start with the bread was stale. I had the fish and chips with mushy peas; my darling wife had the \"mixed grill\". The fish bore absolutely no resemblance to real Fish and Chips, and the mushy peas were simply green peas which had been pulsed in a blender for a couple of seconds... not remotely authentic. The mixed grill (to phrase it how Gordon himself might) was \"F*@king atrocious\". The steak was perhaps passable (though over-cooked and served cold), the weird pork belly thing was a revolting gelatinous mess, and the lame lone shrimp was either horribly spiced or perhaps spoiled. The waitperson did her best, and when I pointed out the shortcoming she apologized but made no effort to resolve.\n\nMr. Ramsay, if you are going to use your brand and our heritage to foist over priced high concept but poorly executed crap to an unsuspecting world, would you at least take the \"British\" part out of your promotion to save us the national embarrassment.  There are a thousand chip shops or hole-in-the-wall cafes up and down our damp nation which wouldn't dream of serving up the swill you deal out in Vegas. It is (by the way) entirely possible to do that kind of fare well in a Vegas context, Todd English proves that to be true every day of the week. If the menu at Caesars was ever decent, it is being betrayed by your team there... sort it out!\n\nIf this makes it to your hallowed halls, we ate on September 10th and our check number was 1884527."

            "review": "We went to GR's P&G this afternoon for lunch and, I won't ask forgiveness for being blunt, this place was absolutely terrible and the only black mark on an otherwise perfect tour of Vegas' fantastic dining experiences. \n\nI must also say that we have very forgiving natures when it comes to restaurants, and that neither of us are food snobs; we simply like good food, whether it's from a proper gastro-pub or from a fine restaurant. This of course was neither. \n\nI ordered the little sliders (I forget already what they called them, having all day tried to repress the memories). I don't mind paying good money for good food or for good quantities. These sliders fit none of those descriptions. Each was as small as a silver dollar, greasier than anything from a proper pub, and to be quite honest flavourless save for the strong garlic butter the came with. A \"plate\" of three of them cost 14 dollars. The \"chips\" were greasier than a fast food place, were not crisp, and flavourless to match the sliders. These little greese-bars were nine dollars alone. \n\nMy charming companion tried the shepherd's pie. Being the verbally generous thing she is, she could only say that the dish wasn't terrible. A 22 dollar bowl of tripe is not what you'd expect from a fancy chef's establishment. Having tasted the pie myself, I could not be so forgiving in my description as her, nor could I really come up with something intelligent and so instead made, I think, an awkward face upon tasting it. \n\nThe one thing I will say was pleasant was the service. The hostess was very friendly, and the server was rather attentive and pleasant. This, combined with the fact we were terribly hungry when we arrived, was the only thing stopping us from walking out. \n\nAgain, I must point out that I am not snobbish when it comes to food. This place was terrible for cheap food, let alone for something this expensive. In our time at Vegas, I have eaten fantastic burgers at \"I Heart Burger\", \"The Grand Lux Cafe\", and KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burgers\" . . . Each of these phenomenal burgers were cheaper than my tiny little sliders and had flavors I cannot even describe. If you feel the need for a good burger, I would recommend any of those. \n\nI feel I must end this review on a positive remark . . . their little symbol of the Union Flag within an English Bulldog was cute."

We didn't have reservations although they take them and were sat in 10 minutes.  We had the luxury of being seated at a low standing coffee table w/ two king chairs on one side and a huge sofa on the other.  Since our party consisted of me, my wife, my 6 month old and our 3 year old, the seating was perfect.  Our waitress came by within 2 minutes of us being sat to take our drink order.  For a gastropub, the \"hard stuff\" concoctions were a little limited (about 10 to choose from - zero tequila based beverages) as the majority of their libations are Beers.  Not a bad thing for a gastropub, but I like having variety open.  We ordered a very tasty Bourbon drink that immediately put a smile on my wife's face and I ordered a Rum concoction that tasted like a Watermelon Cooler.  To start we ordered the \"Chilled Shrimp Salad\" - poached in lemon-beer shandy, light ginger-mayo, w/ red cocktail sauce.  It came out in about 8 minutes and my 3 year old couldn't stop eating \"his shrimpys\".   Very good dish.\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Traditional Shepherd's Pie and the Beef Short-Rib & Cheek sandwhich - on hearth baked sourdough, horseradish mayo, roasted red pepper jam, red onion marmalade.  The Beef Short Rib was one of the best sandwich's i've had.  Dipping it into the horeseradish infused ketchup made all the difference too.  Couldn't get enough of this flavor bomb.  The Shepherd's Pie was also very good, but too traditional.  I would have preferred more gravy and less potatoes.  It was VERY traditional.  Not a bad thing, just hoped he would have kicked it up a notch.  Overall, the meal came out to $100 w/ the two drinks ($30) so overall, medium priced for a Casino meal and would go back."

Both items were tasty enough, but they also had issues. \n\nNot that there is a lot of leeway on a small piece of ground meat, but the sliders were medium well or well done. Waitress didn't ask, so I would assume they'd come medium...no such luck. I mentioned this to the waitress, and she replied that she would \"tell the chef\". That was the end of the subject. No offer to take it back and refire, take it off the check or at least apologize. FAIL. \n\nThe caesar salad was good, but drowning in dressing. Ordered without the anchovies, and it came with them, as I found out by accident when I ate them. FAIL. \n\nJoined the Caesar's loyalty club to save a couple bucks too, and they didn't apply correct pricing on the check. FAIL. After pointing this out, they finally corrected the bill.\n\nOut the door, $35 for less than a quarter pound of burger with cheese and a caesar dressing salad with lettuce. Pretty embarassing, IMHO. \n\n*Memo to Gordon: This place won't last long, serving mediocre and poorly prepared food. Service and preparation of the food was sadly lacking...basically a disorganized and lacking establishment. Let's just say I'm not eager to bet another $35 that it was just a \"bad day\". Despite this, I'm trying Gordon Ramsay Steak tonight...I PRAY that it's up to snuff. Otherwise, this guy is DONE with Ramsay restaurants. This was a Kitchen Nightmare for sure. Maybe you need to check up on your shops more often!"

Then the manager came out and said they had burned the bacon on the 2nd appetizer. He apologized and gave us 2 little dishes of chicken pot pie. And the devils on horseback came out within 2-3 min later.  Just that little thing with the manager made all the difference. It made us feel better and not just part of the huge vegas crowd.

Our survey Rodney was great!  He was friendly and waived or cake cutting fee!  Because if him I added an extra star. \n\nSo why only three stars?  For the food and the price. Looking at the menu its traditional pub food. We ordered steak and ale pie, shepards pie, burgers, fish and chips, bangers and mash and short ribs... Basically almost everything on the menu.  Sounds really good. I never really crave this kind of food but I  thought it was great change. After ordering we were all really excited but the food took forever to come!!  I swear it was 45 mins. Granted we did have a bigger group of 8 but I thought it was still too long. I ordered the lamb burger upon recommendation. For 25 bucks a burger... I expected more. I tried Gordon ramsays burger place in planet hollywood and I thought that was way better. The meat was juicier and was less dry. The fish and chips were good and so was the steak and ale pie. When I say good it's not amazing or a must try. It's decent.  But it wasn't worth 30 dollars a dish. I think they charge for the atmosphere which is great but the food was sub par.  \n\nThis is a good option if you like pub food and enjoy the atmosphere more than quality of food. We had a great time with great company but I don't think I'll pick to eat at this place again. :)"

So I looked at the menu, and did not see it on the menu to order it. We thought, it must come later.\n\nSo after about 15 min, we got our drinks, and no bread.\nAnother 15 min, no bread. by this time, we are like WTF? Our waitress did not even come by!! UGH. I am hungry and mad\n\nSo 10 more min, she came by and we asked about the bread, and she said, \" you have to order it\". well by this time, our dinner was coming, and we said no.\n\nOur food finally came. I ordered the Salmon, and I had asked if it was salty, and she said no. well first bite: SALTY!! UGH! Oh and it said it came with garlic chips, so I was expecting FRIES! as the rest of the menu had CHIPS (which are fries). Well you know what they were? SMALL ASS 4 pieces of garlic american chips. So small I didnt even see them!!! \n\nthe fish and chips were OKAY, notthing special. I have had much better in Seattle and in dana Point, CA. \n\nSo overall:\n\n1. SERVICE: SUCKS! ( water NEVER got refilled)\n2. FOOD is WAY TO Overprices for what you get (I can get much better food for the same price in Vegas)\n3. FOOD IS OKAY, nothing WOW.\n\nI will never come back here again, and I do not recommend it at all. horrible horrible. Dont waste you time. Vegas is about fun and good food, well this is not one of them. \n\nGordan Ramsey, sorry  this place is not so good."

Not the greatest option, but I'll take it.\n\nAfter a half hour or so our food comes out. I got a salad that contained chanterelle mushrooms and spring mix with a vinaigrette on it... that's it. My special salad sucked. It wasn't very special and I ate about a third of it. \n\nMy wife had fish and chips and the fries were ok. The batter fell off the fish and was an oily mess and she said the Dog and Duck pub in Austin makes it better... This is supposed to be one of their signature dishes and it was a total fail.\n\nThe worst part about it is when you see Gordon on his shows \"fixing\" restaurants he is always watching what comes back to the dishwasher to see if customers actually finish their meals. Neither one of us came close to finishing ours and no one said anything to us about it... \n\nI guess he doesn't hold his restaurants to the same standards as the failing ones that are on his shows."

Nicely done. Since it was a busy week, the restaurant is integrated with OpenTable so you can reserve a table without calling in and waiting. \n\nFood wise, I ordered their lamb burger - medium well. It was nicely cooked with the center slightly pink so the burger was nice and tender. The toppings on the burger is flavourful. But the seasoning on the meat seems to be uneven. First bite it feels like it was not seasoned enough, but when I reach the end it seemed a little too salty. Expected them to mix the seasoning in the meat evenly considering it is Ramsy's restaurant. \n\nService was a little slow but that might have been due to the CES volume of people. \n\nbtw they forgot to give me ketchup for the fries... gave me an empty dipping container..."

The bartender was quick to take my order and the wait staff were very friendly and appeared very much into providing a great experience.\n\nI ordered the squash soup and it was serviceable but that's as much as I can say for it. It lacked the complexity I've had with squash soup at Mesa, Paley's Place, etc. Just a dollop of sour cream on top and served with garlic bread, so any crunch and extra flavor came from the bread.\n\nI was truly looking forward to the sticky toffee pudding, as I LOVE sticky toffee pudding. The pudding part was perfect, a lovely dense cake. But the \"toffee\" lacked much flavor other than being sweet. I'm used to the toffee being much more, er, toffee-flavored. Also, the server brought it to me without a spoon and had to go look for one after pouring the toffee syrup over the cake. Ah, well, that will save me lots of calories in the future. If it had been as good as the ones I am used to, I would be dining here every meal while in Vegas. I'm happy others were pleased by it, but for me it was a complete disappointment.\n\nThis was my second time at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and both have been disappointing, just lacking in much flavor and everything could use a dash of salt."

Average, at best. The food was just OK and definitely not worth the price.\n\nService was just okay. The staff was friendly, but slow and hard to flag down. We constantly felt like we were waiting. Waiting for drink orders, waiting for drinks, waiting for food orders, waiting for other drink orders, waiting for drinks we ordered that never showed up, and waiting for dessert. It was ridiculous.\n\nI had a shot at a few beers, scallops, short rib, scotch egg, steak, and of course the sticky toffee.\n\nThe scallops were abysmal. I've paid half the cost and received twice as many, better prepared. Two people ordered scallops at our table and both orders were bad. They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked. Would not have this again at this restaurant.\n\nThe short rib, while tender, seemed lackluster in flavor. As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.\n\nThe steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.\n\nThe scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.\n\nThe sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again. One of the best desserts I have ever had.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this place. You can get similar or better food at a plethora of other restaurants, for a fraction of the price. If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be appalled at how this restaurant is executing."

Dim lighting and cozy wooden kinda feel...with sports games to watch. Our waitress, Daisy, is absolutely amazing and I think our experience would not have been as awesome if not for her. She had a great sense of humor, top notch service, and was completely professional yet personal at the same time. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nLamb shank: This actually brought my friend back to the days when his mother was still around and cooked him this as a young boy. The meat literally fell off the bone, and no knife was needed. An amazing dish, especially one that could trigger such nostalgic memories.\n\nFish and chips: I loved their thick steak fries--well seasoned and pairs GREAT with their house-made ketchup--trust me, this ain't no Heinz. The ketchup is AWESOME. Apparently they make all of their sauces and you really can taste the difference--the tartar sauce for the fish and chips was also very well done. The fish itself was tasty and yummy, though not our favorite (which is actually a gluten free dish located in Florida), but it still was a winning dish in our tummies.\n\nBaby carrot side: This came with brussel sprouts and bacon lardon--I swear, bacon makes EVERYTHING taste good. This dish was simple and nice as far as veggies go, though I would have liked it cooked a minute or two more to get an even softer bite for the carrots. Still, not a bad side...though I might opt to try another side next time.\n\nForest mushroom with frisee: It's literally shrooms and frisee. Granted, the frisee is very lightly dressed--just the way I like it and very fresh. The shrooms are delicious and well cooked...but that's really all you should expect. Nothing else fancy thrown in there.\n\nOverall, I really want to come back, say hi to our wonderful waitress, and to try their other goodies. Everything looks amazing...I've been to all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas, and  none of them have let me down yet!"

Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill resides in the space formerly occupied Bradley Ogden, one of the early pioneers of chef-driven restaurants in Las Vegas.  Given what came before in the space, GRP&G and its gastropub cuisine had a tough act to follow.  While GRP&G may tout itself as an English pub, from a design perspective, it looked like anything but.  No matter, since I wasn't there to dissect the interior design.  \n\nOn the first night, I had the Pub Crawl ($15) made with Knob Creek Bourbon, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, fresh lemon, mint & black tea syrup.  Perfectly balanced, nicely sweet, but not overdone, it was a big winner!  On the second night, I left it in the hands of the talented bartenders to craft me something with whiskey, boozy and bitter.  I don't know what they made me, but it was a taste success.  We also had the Duck Confit Poutine ($13/12 for Total Rewards members), which may have seemed out of place at an English pub, but I found it tasty if a bit untraditional. The fries were hot and crispy reminiscent of McDonald's fries in a very good way.  They were topped with a relatively generous amount of nicely tender and moist duck.  Thoughtfully, a flavorful and thankfully not overly salty duck gravy was served on the side allowing you to sauce the dish yourself (and likely preserve the crispiness of the fries).  What seemed to be missing from the dish were the expected cheese curds.  Perhaps they don't use it in their recipe since it wasn't listed on the menu or maybe they didn't add very much and it was simply lost in the dish.  Nevertheless, cheese curds would've added a nice color, textural, and flavor contrast to the poutine.\n\nGordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was an unexpected good time.  However, it was the friendliness, professionalism, and skill of the bartenders in crafting our drinks on both nights that really made it memorable.  If Gene, either of the Adams, and/or Raul are behind the bar, you'll be in very good hands with regards to craft cocktails, great customer service and witty banter.  As for the food, it was good, but not on par with the drinks.  Hopefully, with the newly anointed Hell's Kitchen winner in kitchen, the food will come together more completely and coherently with the rest of the restaurant.  Regardless, GRP&G will be at the top of the list for drinks (definitely) and another go at the food the next time we're in town."

            "review": "When it comes to British-themed gastropubs in the US, this is as good as it gets. Of course, it doesn't come anywhere close to Ramsey's original gastropubs, the Devonshire in Chiswick and the Narrow in Limehouse, London but that's not unexpected.\n\nThe menu is a delightful mix of classic British pub favorites and simple seasonal dishes seasoned with a sense of humor; so, if you expect to find fine or upscale dining, you'll likely be disappointed. While the service is an odd mix of attitude, amateurishness, and friendliness, we did enjoy the large selection on tap and some very decent food. I found it silly that they won't let you sub a side dish on a $60 prix-fix that features ordinary dishes from the regular menu but life's too short to worry about that. Also, I'm not a fan of casual restaurants where there's no salt and pepper on the table - even though I'm very unlikely to actually salt my food, I'd like to have the option should I ever wish to do so. This practice has nothing to do with the food or the guests, it's all about the chef's ego. On the bright side, I found it very comforting to have European soccer on and enjoyed some kick-ass music playing. \n\nAll in all, be open minded, come to Ramsay's Pub & Grill, don't expect a fine dining experience but rather enjoy a decent casual dinner, have a pint and have a laugh. Also, give yourself a break and stop imagining what GR would or wouldn't do if he were there for you might find you actually enjoy the experience for what it is. (And stop looking for the salt shaker already.)"

            "review": "Oh, I do adore an authentic British pub and grill! Sadly, it would appear that rather than pay homage to all things British, Gordon Ramsay has chosen for his new pub at Caesars Las Vegas to be decidedly, well, \"Vegas.\" There are some delightful menu items that you would find in a typical pub, however, the d\u00e9cor is a confusing mix of casino tackiness and partially abandoned distillery. Much of the restaurant is open to the casino and the rest is a hodgepodge of randomly selected items any Anglophile would order from Amazon. The only part of the restaurant that harkened toward anything truly 'pub-like\" was the bar. Ray-Ray, the bartender on staff, was a hoot and I'd probably go back just to chat with him again. (We left him a tip double the cost of our meal partly because of his compassionate care of an elderly couple we assume must be regulars). Much of the wait staff is also typical Vegas, so you may or may not be concerned about strange bosoms falling out as they deliver your meal. We really only wanted a light nosh and a cocktail, so thought sticking with appetizers and salads was the best way to sample the fare. I must admit that I broke a cardinal rule in straying from \"typical\" pub fare and ordered the lobster roll, simply because I am desperate to have at least one great one each year. (For any who've read any of my reviews on Tripadvisor, you'll note I made the same mistake at Hilton Head Island in March, 2015.) I should have listened to my husband! He ordered the Wedge Salad and he truly enjoyed the Shropshire bleu cheese paired with the bacon vinaigrette, I ordered a Maine Lobster roll on lemon poppy seed brioche. (I know!) I was so anticipating that first, delightful bite of buttery richness from the roll that looked as if it was lovingly slathered and grilled face down, anticipating it would complement the rich, slightly sweet creaminess of the lobster salad. And then, the music died. As I deconstructed the roll, I noticed that the butter was probably brushed across the top, then the bread was slid through a pizza oven so that only the bare top was toasted. The rest was a fairly dry, barely lemon or poppy seed flavored brioche. Disappointed again. I'd like to say that maybe they were having an off day since it was shortly before Las Vegas' annual Bon Appetite event that was being held at Caesars, but would have to make plans to visit again when we return in June. This time, I'll try the Frog in a hole or the Bangers and Mash. With so many other places to try on the Strip, a restaurant can't just be okay; it has to rock your socks off. We travel to Las Vegas multiple times a year, and consider ourselves to be \"foodies,\" and will normally give a place two bites of the apple so to speak. If we are disappointed again; we won't be back."

For heaven's sake, I've watched the man yell at people for making bad food. He should really yell at himself. \n\nSeervice: Staff were friendly but not stellar. They were more focused on trying to push more items to sell. We had five in our party and took over an hour to get our food. Granted, it was 8pm on Saturday night, food came really slow.\n\nFood: We orderes fish & chips, corned beef brisket sandwich, burger, scotch eggs, salted pretzels and beer. Servings were huge but everything tasted mediocre at best. We left most of our dishes untouched more than half and didn't bother to take the rest home. \n\nPrice: $260 for the five of us and 4 beers."

We decided to go to Gordon's this was the best decision of our trip! It was happy hour ( runs from 2-6pm and includes half off of certain drinks and appetizers.) OMG I could not get passed the appetizer menu as it all sounded good. Good is an understatement I decided on the hellfire wings (spicy but delicious) and could not get enough of the sauce ! Then I had kettle chips which were topped with cheese , pulled pork and more, yummmm ! My husband got a burger which he claimed the best burger he has ever had!! Gordon he is hard to please but you did it!! After tasting everything, enjoying the atmosphere, the friendly wait staff and the signature cocktail obviously we went back another night for more!!! Gordon has multiple locations in Vegas that specialize in different dishes and it's easy to see why!!!"

The bartender refused to change the station because he was a chargers fan. He was wearing a chargers leather helmet at the time. When we asked to speak to a manager it took over 20 min for Casey who was the manager to arrive and she argued with us about changing the station instead of complying with our customer request. In addition when I asked the hostess in front for a manager she said there were a lot of managers on duty and one of the managers is Brandy. When I asked Casey about this she claimed there was no manager there named Casey. We ended up leaving the bar very upset at the level of unprofessionalism displayed at this establishment by the staff and management. I suggest that Corporate management start sponsoring customer service training for all staff members at this establishment."

Then the fish for the fish and chips just didn't taste good at all. However the star was the 3 mini pies. Steak and ale, Shepards and chicken pot."

Other people at the table liked them a lot more than me, but I thought they were quite good. The pretzels were good, but far overpriced for a few pieces of bread and mustard. I feel like this should be something every table gets for free. I really wanted to try to duck poutine too, but they were out.\n\nOne main reason for giving this 3 stars instead of 4 is that for a pub their beer selection is quite poor. All common bar beers, with just a few common English \"pub\" beers like Boddingtons and Guinness. Nothing exotic. Nothing unique. As a beer lover I was extremely disappointed with their selection. This should be a feature!\n\nI'm not a big fan of the choices in costume for Pub & Grill or Gordon's \"Steak\" place. It all comes off as a bit Vegas and cheesy to me. Dressing the servers and hostesses up in stereotypical \"English\" garb is... it's either shortsighted, or worse, pandering. I can't imagine the people working there enjoy it either.\n\nWe all had burgers. Great pate, great buns, great cheese. It was an excellent and simple burger and by far, for me, the highlight. Would like to stop by here again and try some of the other entrees but I'm not sure I could stay away from another burger."

It was wonderful to not have to explain how to mix a Perfect Manhattan. As Randy explained, all the bartenders have won contests. Well...it showed. Randy also steered us to two wonderful desserts, sticky toffee pudding and snickerdoodle madeleine. \n\nWe also got to meet Scott Cummings, the winner of Season 12 Hell's Kitchen.
