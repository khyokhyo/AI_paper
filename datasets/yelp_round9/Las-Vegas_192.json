            "review": "My boss chose this spot to have our manager's holiday dinner. I don't know why she picked this spot since none of us live by Red Rock Casino, but whatever. I looked at pictures and read reviews before we arrived so I had my heart set on the guacamole and carne tacos. I'll get to the food in a bit. \n\nI'm glad the restaurant was right in front of the casino. You park in front and its right there as you enter. We had made reservations prior so it was easy to sit our party of 12. Not like we needed reservations anyway because the restaurant wasn't even busy. Our server was quick to offer us drinks and appetizers while we all chatted and decided what to eat. Here comes the food...\n\nSalsa trio-3 salsas perfect for sharing with the table. Our server was nice enough to bring out all 5 of their salsas (which had unlimited refills). All were decent except for the chipotle salsa. It tasted like plastic to me for some reason. And the other salsas were decent. Nothing really stood out as wow. \n \nGuacamole-pretty average guacamole. I could have made better at home. And $10 for a small serving? Yeah no.\n\nCarne tacos- carne asada tacos topped with a watercress-jicama slaw. The meat was really tough and chewy. Another person at my table also said his carne tacos were tough. The watercress-jicama slaw had no jicama and was very bland. I had to put salsa and guacamole in the taco to make it have some sort of flavor. \n\nSo, for my small plate of guacamole and my 4 tough and flavorless tacos, I ended up paying $28. The price would have been fine had I enjoyed my food. So many other taco spots in town that I'd rather go to and spend way less and be satisfied. Definitely do not recommend this place. Our server was nice and made sure our glasses were never empty, which is why it's a 2 star review instead of 1."

Both were FAB! They also have salsa sampler very nice and great chips servered hot. We also ordered the guacamole quite good but pretty dang \"spicy\" for my tastes. Also indulged in a margarita, yuuum very deserving of the awards the server mentioned they have been awarded \n    Our server, Vivian was pleasant alittle ditzy tho & the food runner was nice too! The manager came by our table, which was nice too.\n    The food is tapas style so smaller portions, PERFECT for sharing."

To die for, probably the BEST margarita I've ever had. We had tacos, steak nachos, and some other stuff I can't remember. We finished it with their chocolate cake. I am satisfied. Thank you chef Hector and Juan for cooking us a great meal.  see you on Thursdays for ladies night!and thank you Adrian for serving us, you were right about all the recommendations."

Well worth it. I had 12 of them. My faves were shrimp and the fish tacos. The only downside were the limes: too dry. The waiter was great. He made sure I never went without a taco in front of me. He told me they are going to report start a taco challenge after the new year, I think u need to eat 35 tacos in an hour. He recommended me for the challenge. Maybe I will come back to try it. The draft beers are $3 during happy hour. Not a bad spot inside of the Red Rock resort."

A little small on the portion size but very tasty.\nThe Carne Asada nachos were great!!  Very tasty with nice portions of carne asada and other tasty toppings.\nThe Mixto Ceviche was okay.  Not the best and definitely not the best. Next time I'll skip this dish and try something else.\n\nAfter the apps we ordered several different types of tacos.  \nPollo Tacos.. AMAZING!!!  Nice topping of corn and avocado salsa.  A definite must.\nCarne Asada Tacos were also great!!  Came topped with some nice fresh watercress.  Not a typical topping for tacos but a nice compliment.\nCamarones came in a great sauce.  You wanted to make sure to not lose a drop.\nPastor Tacos were my least favorite but I'm not a huge pineapple fan.  The pork was flavored great.\nMexican Corn...  make sure to order this side dish. It's messy but totally worth it!!\n\nAs for cocktails we had regular margarita, strawberry margarita, red sangria and some beers.  \n\nGreat night...  looking forward to going back."

There are four to a plate. Even more obnoxious, when asked about it, you are given a lecture that their restaurant is based on sharing and how 2 people at the table can each order tacos and they can be shared if \"you're the type of person who shares\".  Weird... Don't show up unless you are comfortable enough to share with some one in your party off your plate.  A Mexican inspired restaurant that doesn't have refried beans unless it's dinner time, an environment that is uppity and a staff that is condescending and socially awkward. I just wonder how long it will be until they go under. We didn't even stay to eat, we couldn't stomach the attitudes. The rest of my party felt same way."

Collectively we had house Margaritas, traditional guacamole, red table salsa, ceviche mixto, lobster tacos and pastor tacos. We loved all of them! The ceviche had passion fruit juice in the citrus marinade which gave it an amazing  flavor. The lobster tacos had nice big chunks of lobster. The meat in the pastor tacos was lean and they added the traditional pineapple. The Margaritas were good. Overall the take on Mexican food here is light, fresh and modern. Traditional stuff with a little tweaking. There was nothing heavy or overly spicy. We will return!"

That was a total mess last time since the area it was restricted to was way to small for the demand.  Anyways, Jessica totally redeemed this restaurant for us.  The issues we had last time was fixed by her.  \n\nI'm still not a fan of the pre-made Guacamole but our server Jessica went to the kitchen and asked to have Guacamole made without cilantro.  It was fresh and chunky.  She wasn't pushy as far as upselling like our other server so all in all after four drinks and two sets of tacos we were good to go for happy hour.  \n\nIt's still scary to think you can get one drink for the price of one taco though, even at happy hour.  But I'll come back as long as other servers can step up like Jessica did."

If I am going to eat a $12 taco, then the tortillas should AT LEAST be had made. I don't care about the atmosphere or fancy lighting, if you consider yourself a Mexican gourmet restaurant, at least offer better food than taco bell.

The food might rate a 4 but you factor in prices and the poor quality service and there is no way I can give it any higher than a 2 star.\n\nSome examples,  for $15 you get 4 mini size tacos.  The guacamole has so much lime it is overpowering.  They are going after the boutique Mexican food place yet their flavors just don't justify the overpriced menu.  Salad choices are limited to 2, greens salad which isn't bad and a Mexican chef salad.  When asking if 8 can pay to add the grilled swordfish the answer is NO but I can add chicken? ??.\n\nIf this was a sub $15 per person pricing level (6 people our bill was $150 with only one appetizer ordered pre tax and pre tip) it might rate better.\n\nAs for service.  They being out one plate at a team from the kitchen.  The last plate took 10 minutes from the first plate (last plate was the salad).\n\nIf you are stuck at Red Rock I suppose this is better than Albertos down the street but not by much."

The owner was so kind to send me a personal note and ask if the restaurant could try again and make up for the less than stellar experience. We decided to go back and give it a whirl. \n\nSo first off, I said it last time and I'll say it again, the margaritas were the best in town. Seriously, they are amazing. They are on \"draft\" and made days ahead of time and they are just by far amazing. \n\nThe chips were delicious again and the guacamole, although not made table side, was delicious this time. \n\nThis time, our reservation was taken on time and we were treated like kings and queens. We ordered a variety of the tacos to try different flavors and they were all amazing. The fish, steak, pork and chicken were all fantastic. We got full on tiny tacos but they were truly filling and actually just the right portions for tasting with your friends. The server checked on us often, the manager came over to say hi and they even treated our friend to a free desert since it was her birthday. \n\nOne caveat, we did try to go early for a drink before dinner but unfortunately all the seats at the bar were taken and they really don't have an area for others to stand around and enjoy a drink. The hostess outside was less than inviting about the issue as well. So we did have to go have a drink somewhere else in Red Rock. A loss for the restaurant since we would have spent another $50 bucks on drinks for the group before dinner too. \n\nOverall, this time it was a win. I won't go back because they asked us to, I will go back because we simply want to. Hopefully, it will still be as good when they aren't expecting us, to do a make good. \n\nWorth a try."

The hosts and hostesses were very friendly and our waitress was wonderful.  Our glasses were never lower than half full, the food came out hot and empty plates were taken away quickly.\n\nThe entire meal was great and everything we tried was full of flavor.  To begin the evening we ordered salsa and chips.  There are five salsas on the menu (as well as four varieties of guacamole) and we decided to share the tomatillo salsa before dinner.  Fresh and delicious.  The portion was relatively small when compared to many Mexican restaurants, but not too small.  We still had some left over to enjoy with our main courses.  The best part of this was we weren't tempted to eat too many chips.  They seem interested in ensuring you leave enough room to enjoy everything else you order, and there's no reason not to select a variety of choices from across the menu to share with your party.\n\nThe tacos came in fours and we shared two different styles: Pastor and Carne.  The Carne were perfectly prepared and the pieces of skirt steak were just the right size so that you could enjoy steak with every bite and topped with a variety of greens.  The pastor was just as good, slightly spicy and topped with grilled, diced pineapple and a chili salsa.  Both were fantastic.  We each also ordered a side of Elite Mexicano.  This side comes with two ears of corn.  Next time we'll order one to share and another side for additional variety.\n\nFor desert we shared Torrejas de Bolillo--essentially a Mexican bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle.  Just like everything else we tasted, this dish was full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  A great end to a great meal!\n\nWe'll definitely go back.  Probably soon!"

We only had to wait about 15 minutes (5 shorter than we were quoted). The ladies had aguas frescas - both the cucumber-lime and pineapple-ginger were yummy. My husband also had a beer from the bar while we waited. They quickly served the drinks without issue.\n\nOn to the meal: started with the guac as well as salsa with chips. Delicious flavors. Yes, you have to pay for the chips and salsa...but they were very tasty and not too expensive. Honestly we saved more room for the meal without excessive free chips. We then shared the fish and shrimp tacos (4 each order), sides of rice and beans and Mac n cheese, & queso fondito w/ shortribs. Everything was tasty, served timely and at a good temperature. The shrimp tacos and Mac and cheese were the stand out heroes of the meal. We had a few leftovers that were devoured a home within 24 hours.\n\nFinally, the service: I know we're not the easiest table given the feisty 1 year old. I take him out if he fusses, but while eating he is still a handful. Our service was wonderful. They were timely with food, drinks and the check, and dealt with our son nicely.\n\nWe will be back - really - already have plans for this week :-)"

I had a guava margarita which was GREAT and the shrimp tacos and the sweet potato guacamole which were both outstanding.  \n\nNow to the service..\n\nOur server was Nicole.  It was Cinco De Mayo so i'm sure they were busier than normal, however, upon taking our order she randomy walked away.  She came back and after we had already told her our orders we had to repeat them.  Upon bringing the drinks she couldnt remember who ordered what.  Our receipts were mixed up and to top it off upon leaving the restaurant she approached us asking if this credit card she had in her hand was ours.  Luckily for whoever the CC holder is we are good people and wouldn't take a card that wasn't ours but overall it was a very strange interaction. I will say though that I do drink a LOT of water and the men who fill up the water were on top of it which was fantastic.\n\nI will definitely be back as the food was outstanding however I would hope the service would be better."

Restaurant was not that busy but it was a Monday night so wasn't expecting a huge crowd.\n\nIts a nice place, used to be the old LBS burger joint. We were seated quickly back in the bar area. Waitress was there quickly as well to explain the menu and get our drinks. My friend ordered a Dos Equis, and they were out. I ordered the margarita. After looking at the menu, my friend went with the flautas as he wasn't too hungry, I went with the carne tacos ($15).\n\nFood came out pretty quickly. The flautas were pretty good, with a bit of a spicy sauce on them. The carne tacos were also very flavorful, with no spice, more of a sweetness to them. Meat was tender. Overall not a bad meal for $48 for two.\n\nI'd go back, but I wouldn't make a special point of it. Nothing really wow'd me to the point of \"I must have this again\". The margarita was a bit too sweet. I could see doing happy hour here with friends, but I wouldn't crave coming here just for the food. Cantina Laredo in Tivoli Village was a bit better."

Oh, you want rice and beans with your meal?  You have to pay extra for that too!  All taco plates come with 4 tacos (small tacos), you cannot mix and match, all have to be the same (all chicken, all beef, all pork, etc.)  Rubios has better fish tacos.  Spending $80.00 for 2 on a Mexican meal, and a couple alcohol drinks for 2 at a local spot, is absurd!  Service was just ok.  They say they are from New York and Chicago, people expect to pay these absurd prices there, so go back to NY and Chicago and continue to rip off those people!"

The last time I was here I came with my dad and we ordered a variety of tacos and couldn't decide what we liked better! The icing on the cake was that they carry ballast point IPA and I got it for $4 thanks to happy hour! Most places I've been to sell it for $8+/glass. Service was excellent as well. I wish I'd caught our servers name but he made some excellent recommendations without pushing his own preferences on us which I really appreciated. I'll definitely return and order the mango guacamole! Didn't get to try that since dad doesn't like mango"

The hostess tells us it will just be a couple minutes until we are seated... Well 6:30 rolls around and we still weren't seated. Then a hostess tells us that it will just be a couple more minutes as they are waiting on a wheel chair for a guest at the table we will be sitting at. We see the wheel chair come in and go to a table... But not the table we got sat at. Nooooooo they gave our table away and proceeded to sit us at a table that was made for 3 at most (we had a party of 4). \n\nWe are crammed in this table and pissed off considering we waited about 40 minutes. When we complained about the table the manager LIES to us and says that the table is made for 4 people. Clearly it's not, in the rest of the restaurant they have 2 people sitting at identical tables not even ten feet away. \n\nI will give this place another try just because of the food. But the managers need to learn how to deal with upset customers. Apologizing and fixing it would've come off a lot better than lying."

Each time the server came over with a dish they stood there trying to figure out where to put it. Only Margaritas on ice, not blended. My Chardonnay was tepid. The glass was dirty and sticky. Not remarkable especially with alarms going off three times and someone whistling like they were hailing a cab.\nNot a great evening out. We could barely understand our server, Paola, who was not very helpful in making choices. \nMy advice is to read the menu before you arrive so that you know the ingredients and what appeals to you. I would not order the chili relleno again but the flautas were great. The carne tacos were full of fat and not pleasant.\nDon't think we shall be returning, especially due to the noise level."

My husband has the Carne Asada Large Plate and it was also fantastic!  We started off with the queso...which is very good, but the size is laughable for the price. (The \"skillet\" could fit just one egg and that is what they serve the queso in.  It is basically a portion for one person, stretched to share for two people, but $10 is a bit high for that tad bit of cheese.)  They state in the beginning of dinner that everything is sharable so you assume large portions.  This is NOT the case. Unless you have a very small appetite, there is not much sharing that we were able to do.  The prices are definitely on the high side for the portion size, but the flavors were worth it as everything tasted good.  The only \"negatives\" which are more annoying than negative, are:  1) It can get quite loud as the bar noise takes over the dining room and 2) I realize they were trying to maximize the small space, but the little two-seater tables are quite small so you really hope to have good \"neighbors\" as your fellow diners.  I wish the seating area was different but definitely worth the try to this restaurant.  The food will be worth it! Make a reservation or you will be waiting a long time!"

Also, its not \"Mexican food\" , it's \"Tapas\". I know trends are trends but Tapas is dying out and since Toro's has moved ( and a good move I may add)  to more traditional mexican I can only surmise its a matter of time before this place does too, or they just replace it with something else. Overall, I will still take my El Burrito and Frank and Fina's. \n\nAlso, no one reached out to me here from Mercadito on my previous review, so I assume they have ZERO social media presence."

            "review": "\"I'm disappointed\" is what I kept saying Saturday night when we left El Mercadito. I was the instigator who dragged our entire group over there for Mexican food. \n\nTHIS IS FANCY MEXICAN FOOD, NOT ROBERTOS, NOT A ROACH COACH, SO THOSE WHO LIKE TO EAT TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT GET READY FOR A PORTION SHOCK. \n\nI made reservations on Opentable for 6:30 pm for 4, then later added a 5th and we were moved to 6:45pm. That was ok, i can understand that since it was a Saturday night (1/24/2015). \n\nNow, the food, the wait, Price, the presentation, vibe and service. \n\nEverything was Disappointing, except for the wait. Thank goodness for opentable.\n\nEverything is served tapas style. (Something I did not know when i read about them coming to Vegas in Zagat).  The food  comes out as it is ready. Great concept right?? Not. My side order to my food (rice and beans $4.50) came before my appetizer of Guacamole ($9.50). \n\nThe portions are small so you kinda had to share and buffet it in order to get full. I felt like i ordered half the menu to fill up. \n\nI had Chicken Flautas (approx $9.50)  which come 3 to a plate. They were good, but spicy! My moms flautas  were never this spicy. My girlfriend and my husband ordered tacos, those were tiny, so I gave her some of my food. My friends enchiladas came 20 mins after everyone's food came. He was the hungriest out of all of us and the last one to be fed. \n\nThe vibe is great for this looking to party later on. Getting your drink on, the music is somewhat loud so coming here to visit with friends is not the place to go.\n\nSilver lining- The presentation is amazing. Their drinks and even ice (blocks) are fancy. The food looks too pretty to eat, but as small as they were I had better for what we were paying. Its fancy mexican. It's good. Not authentic but good. High five to the guys in the kitchen making this magic.. Just maybe make the tortillas a little bigger please? \n\nWe saw our waitress once or twice but the rest of the time we were service by a man in a white stripped long sleeve shirt (i think he was the manager). He just came to pick up the plates and I asked him for a soda re-fill and said never mind, i see my waitress I'll ask her. She bypassed our table and didn't even look at our empty glasses that needed a re-fill. 2 mins later the gentlemen brought it out! He was also the gentlemen who i asked for the dessert menu because our waitress never came back. 10 mins later she showed up and recited the dessert menu (who doesn't have a physical menu to look at these days??). My white friends were wondering what the heck the 3 items were. At that point we were done and asked for the check. I believe she said coconut flan, churros and something else we had no idea (even me and I'm Mexican)what it was. \n\nMaybe she had too many tables? Maybe we didn't seem like people who were dropping hundreds on drinks that night like the table next to us..But we are paying customers. Show a little attention."

Fortunately, Mercadito is a upscale, trendy Mexican restaurant serving an imaginative menu of delicious, intriguing small-plates of traditional Mexican and designer Mexican nibbles. \nWe had Tacos, which can only be described as exciting, are served four to a plate, include the usual suspects but also offer versions with huitlacoche, mushrooms, Manchego cheese and salsa verde; and shrimp with roasted garlic, chipotle mojo and avocado. Charcoal-edged, bright pink slices of rosemary-marinated skirt steak make the tacos carne memorable; the taquizas, or assemble-it-yourself tacos, include a Berkshire pork carnitas version \n\nTHE MARGARITAS ARE EXCELLENT!! Try the one made with mezcal which adds an intense smoky flavor. Not to be missed are the Mercadito's Aqua Frescas which are pur\u00e9ed daily. I loved the ginger- lime and the cucumber-lime. Of course we had to have dessert, toasted coconut flan, and it was simply amazing - I cannot stop thinking about it. \n\nWe sat at the bar and Gus took excellent care of us.

I sat at a table that was part booth part chairs, I sat on the chair side. When the waiter arrived he popped up right by my shoulder that I was afraid to turn and talk to him since he was so close to my face! He was pretty creepy the rest of the meal too not just when ordering. \n\nI ordered the flautas and my friend got tacos. She said her tacos were mediocre and my flautas were also not anything special. I was however disappointed that when I specifically said no cheese multiple times it of course showed up with cheese on top. I hate being one to return food but due to religious reasons I absolutely could not have cheese and I was specific about it when I returned the food. Not long after they returned with my food and the plate clearly had the cheese scraped off because there were still remnants of cheese on the plate. I was so irked and my friend was waiting for me to eat that I just didn't want to send my plate back again. I sucked it up and ate around the small remnants of cheese. \n\nI will not be back though! They should be ashamed of themselves for not taking a religious dietary restriction more seriously! I would only go back to enjoy some chips and salsa and some drinks out on the patio even though the service wasn't that great."

The place is EXTREMELY LOUD!, We get seated, bus boy shows up with water, pours the water into my wife's glass and the idiot keeps on pouring, spilling water on my wife, The SOB doesn't even apologize, not a friggin word from him, I wave our waiter down and asked if the bus boy spoke English, the waiter assured me he did, but I wasnt convinced. \n\nAnyhow we order some drinks browse the menu and decide to have the mixto ceviche, the waiter asked us if we were sure thats all we wanted, the lovely wife and I agreed thats all we wanted, So he asked one more time and we were like WTF is up, he says \"I know our concept is sharing style\" but the portions are only 7 ounces so I recommend you add something else to your order\" we were like are you effing serious how the eff do you share 7 ounces? (If you ever had a ceviche tostada you folks know that its more than 7 ounces and you know you are not about to share that tastey ceviche tostada) so we add the camaron ceviche and the espada tacos, the waiter was still sure it wasnt gonna be enough food for the lovely wife and I, we adviced him we would be okay with our order.\n\nThe food arrives, the tacos were cold, the ceviche was lacking acid and proper salt and heat. the chef should be ashamed of himslef for callig this garbage \"ceviche\". if you cant get a ceviche right chances are everything else on that menu will be total disappoinments.\n\nSKIP THE WANNABE MEXICAN FOOD AT THIS PLACE\n\nSHARING STYLE, YEAH EFFING RIGHT, GET OUT HERE WITH THAT BS!"

We arrived right at 4:00 which is when they open for dinner (and it's happy hour from 4 to 6) and we decided to sit on the patio.  We initially sat down in the mini chairs but found them to be awkward so we moved to the outdoor bar. \n\nI loved the fried plantains with the dipping sauce YUM!!  The tacos, drinks and apps are all about 50% off at happy hour.  The guacamole with mango was SO very good and the chips, oh the chips, not good for my waistline but made my tastebuds day!  I couldn't find a bad margarita and trust me when I tell you, I tried!  Guava, Pineapple, the Market one, all so good!\n\nNew: I recently was talked into order the chicken dinner (Pollo Las Brisas, I think but don't quote me on it, lol) is probably the best chicken I've ever tasted.  There is so much flavor packed into one little thigh.  I rarely order chicken especially when I have options like carne tacos but lately I have ordered it every time.\n\nThe manager approached us to ask us if everything was okay and I was sure to let him know that my fellow Yelpers thought that the music was to loud.  He said that the noise in the restaurant seems to carry (it was very full by 6:00) but he took note of it and seemed happy to try to make his customers have a more enjoyable experience.\n\nThis will now be added to my regulars list!!"

I knew the food would be solid, and I was right, it did not disappoint.\n\nThis time, I went to sit at the bar. I can't remember the bartenders name, but he was awesome and we chatted about the World Series since he was a KC fan. Ordered the Tres Viejos drink, basically a totally jacked up shaken margarita. The premium tequila mixed with the house made citrus juices and honey definitely tingled my taste buds, in a good way. The spiced salt that was rimmed on the glass was just the cherry on top. If you are a big fan of cocktails, you should check this place out!\n\nI wanted to check out some food here. I ordered the mango guacamole. I remembered at the previous event, we were given a pineapple guacamole that was outstanding! I thought the mango version would be equally as good. After trying it, I thought that the guac was OK. It didn't have the same \"pow!\" as the pineapple version. The flavor of the mango was lost in the avocado. It felt like the guac was pre-made a considerable amount of time ago. It had oxidized. The chips served with the guac were really good. They were super crispy, and they didn't have much grease on them.\n\nThis time, I ordered a torta, but not just any torta, but a carne version! At the event, they had these carne tacos that were phenomenal. I decided to try their torta version. The dish was also served with French fries. Let me tell y'all about them fries. This may be a Mexican restaurant, but Mercadito probably makes some of the best fries I've ever had. The size is perfect, not shoestring and not steak fries, but a size right in the middle. They were super crispy on the outside and meltingly soft and airy in the middle. This guy right here, he was impressed!\n\nThe torta was extremely good as well. The carne was just like how I remembered it, but it was cut a little bit thicker due to it being a sandwich, which I liked. The meat was seasoned well and cooked to a medium rare center. The slaw filling was creamy and crunchy and full of vegetables and herbs that were very fresh. I loved the torta bread that was used, it was fluffy and buttery. I really enjoyed that they griddle both sides of the bread to give it a nice crunch! A splendid dish.\n\nThe service here is on point. I sat at the bar, and the bartender did a really great job making sure that I was well taken care of. Everyone working there seemed really friendly. \n\nI live quite a distance away so coming here on a regular basis is not really a feasible option for me. But if I did, I would be here all the time. This is a great spot for upscale Mexican cuisine and a superb drink program. They have a great happy hour here as well. Enjoyed my time here and will hopefully be back soon!!"

Maybe I've said it before but it's Mexican food, 12 tacos and guac was $61 and at that price point maybe you'd expect service and food quality to be a bit better.\n\nComing back: No"

The noise level was a little louder than I would have preferred, but I guess that's to be expected. Our server was attentive and my friend and I decided to share two taco plates and some elote.\n\nThe pork belly tacos were my favorite. Good texture and flavor. They even had a nice spicy kick. The camaron were ok, they didn't have as much kick as I would have liked. I will likely ask them to heat the tortillas next time since they were a little on the cooler side. I think that would have made all the difference.\n\nMy friend tried their dessert and said it was good. Their menu is tapas style, so I encourage larger groups to come and share. They had some really interesting cocktails on their menu as well that I look forward to trying on my next Tuesday night visit."

So if you're expecting authentic Mexican cuisine, look elsewhere. What you will find instead is modern twist on Mexican classics. Food here is fresh, tasty, and full of unique and crave-able flavors. \n\nMercadito is best with a group, so that you're able to sample a wide variety of their menu. I haven't found anything on the menu that wasn't extremely tasty.\n\nStand outs (aka order this or your just playin') are: Mac & cheese, guacamole, tacos (all varieties), elote, and the chile rellano.\n\nThe cocktails here look extensive and intricate. No simple margarita will suffice here. If you're looking for some master mixology, this is your place. Especially if you have a thing for tequila.\n\nI haven't had a bad experience here. Services is prompt, friendly, and courteous. The restaurant itself is covered in candy skulls and bright vibrant colors. (Pro-tip: all the servers wear red Adidas kicks.)\n\nCan't wait to gather some friends and split a basket of tortilla chips with the homies, deciding to salsa or guac first... Probably both."

She was very personable and helpful. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar outside because the inside of the restaurant was completely booked until hours later. I told the women working at the bar multiple times that when she had a chance I would like to get started with some appetizers. She took many drink orders from other people before taking my order. I ordered the mango guacamole with chile de arbol to start. It came out quickly and I appreciated seeing a different take on the traditional guacamole. The mango and chipotle went well together. For my main dish I ordered the carne asada plate. The epazote paired with the oregano gave the skirt steak a strong and salty flavor. Under the steak was a watercress-jicama slaw. The biter tang of the watercress and sweetness of the jicama slightly counterbalanced the saltiness of the steak but it was not enough. \n\nThe decor is nice but the food needs some work."

All the tables for 2 are half booth, except the booth is connected to everyones table, and the tables are literally 1.5 feet away from each other. I had to scoot my table to the side to get out, and with that I almost knocked over 2 drinks. Point is, if you're looking to have any type of privacy/conversation don't go here.\n\nFor the food, very expensive for the quality of food. I was almost immediately irritated when I went to order the cheapest thing I could find (Tacos for 16$) and then I hear someone a couple tables down ordering off the \"Happy Hour\" menu. Seriously? We were never offered happy hour nor did we get that menu on our table. Once we asked for it, I saw the same tacos I was going to buy for half the price. I have a feeling if I didn't ask for the Happy Hour menu that they would have ended up charging me full price. Also, the chips and salsa are not free. Seriously?\n\nI wouldn't consider myself cheap but I don't think I have ever been a \"Mexican\" restaurant (I've been to many) that I had to pay for chips & salsa.\n\nI also ordered elote. You know that Mexican corn with mayo, cheese, and chili? I'd like to think it's pretty difficult to mess that up, but they did. They chard the corn first, so half of it was black, and tasted burnt. The nasty burnt parts completely covered up the taste of the other ingredients (although there were barely any mayo/cheese/chili to begin with). \n\nIn the end, for (8) miniature tacos, guac, chips and salsa, and water, it was $40.00. I wouldn't be irritated at this number if I was satisfied but I left far from satisfied."

After I was done sipping on my marg and munching on the chips I decided to order the shrimp tacos, which wouldn't have been my first choice (more of a carne asada gal) but my friend highly recommended them. Four little tacos came out (authentic Mexican) drenched in some orange sauce that had a hint of Chipotle ...

But hubby ordered a Big Nose, and it was really tasty. \n\nWe both had the HH tacos - he had the chicken, and it was sooo good with all the crunchy stuff on top, which was probably the brussel sprouts slaw.  I got the shrimp tacos, and I loved, loved, loved them!  The downside is that I think two little street taco-sized bites for $7.50 is a little overpriced.  Really loved the chips here, which are thicker than most.  That made them extra crunchy, and crunch is one of my basic food groups.  I try to stay away from them at other places, usually taking one or two and breaking them into tiny pieces to make them last.  But at this place I just couldn't stop eating them.  The old advertising line \"Bet you can't eat just one\" takes on new meaning here.\n\nWhat made our visit so much fun was our waiter, Xavier.  Mercadito wasn't crowded, so he spent a lot of time at our table, and we bantered back and forth endlessly, having a great time.  Oh, and he was a terrific server, too.

Fast,friendly service, good stiiff cocktails and great food and atmosphere!!! One of our new favorite places!!!"

The mimosas were good too, and we had 5-6 flavor options which was fun for us to try them all.\n\nAside from the menu itself- the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and constantly checked on us as well as refilled both our alcoholic beverages and water on a regular basis.

Ended up waiting over an hour, the staff seemed unorganized. I checked back with hostess after the forty five, told \"setting you up right now\", nope. Another young lady asks if we've checked in and says she'll check the status and be right back- goes to hostess station and just stands there smiling.??? 80 minutes. But we heard it was good and were determined to try it.\nFinally seated and wait staff is very helpful. Glad it was Restraunt Week as the regular price if $14+ for some street tacos is a bit much. Disappointing that an order must all be same style as that means you're stuck with one version.  The promotion allowed us to try multiple items without breaking the bank.  Carne and chicken tacos were good, they forgot our mahi mahi tacos until we asked for them when the waiter came to take our dessert order. As a non-flan fan I have to say the flan was super tasty.  Overall I go back to meh, I don't think I'll be giving it another try. Wish the burger place was still here- so hard to get a good hamburger in this town without hitting a GR place on the Strip."

We got the one with mushrooms, and they didn't taste bad, but cold Queso Fundito just sucks, period. It came with a spoon, which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.\n\nQuestion: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. \n\nWe ordered our appetizer, but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready, so we politely ordered, hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.\n\nBoy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived, I got my tacos - just mine, apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. \n\nThe other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.\n\nI will not say the food was bad, but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1/3 the price. \n\nThis place is PURE SHIT, an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. \n\nPay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face, it will be a much better use of your money."

When we walked in I had asked if there was any seating available outside, but was told that there was a large party of 33 that would be sitting out there so it couldn't be accommodated. Funny thing is the entire time we were there I did not see that large party come in. Anyways, on to the review.\n\nThis was the first time we've been here. We had one server that had taken part of our order but switched us over to a different server and at that point I could tell things were probably going to get a little complicated. We had ordered a margarita with the original server that never came, it took quite a while for the ceviche to come out, and for the salsa to be refillable you would think they would bring two plates of it (to put one on each side of the table) that way people don't have to reach over the entire table to dip. We had to specifically ask for an additional salsa plate and additional chip bowl just so we didn't have to stretch so far. Another thing that bothered me is that we told them it was a birthday and they just kinda handed us a coconut flan. No candle, nothing. I'm not asking for this place to be like TGIF, but a candle or something could have sufficed for the occasion.\n\nThe food: the chips were ok... A little too hard and girlfriend hated that. The guac was great but the chunks of avocado were a little annoying. I mean I know guac has chunks of avocado but when you can't even dip in the guac bc the chunks are so big, it gets old really fast. In terms of entrees, I personally had the Carne tacos and they were amazing. By far some of the most flavorful tacos I've ever had. Girlfriend had the carnitas and she liked them but I wasn't a fan. Birthday dad and my brother had the ribeye and they enjoyed it, and mom had one of the salads that I forgot the name of. Overall the entrees were good and I would come back for those carne tacos.\n\nThe service: our second server was great. She was super nice and always had a smile on her face. We did have to ask for more drinks when they were empty a few times, but overall it was ok. Again, a candle on the Damn flan would have been great instead of it just being handed to us. \n\nThe ambiance/comfort: basically a typical upper scale Mexican restaurant. We were seated in a booth that was kinda high chair like. For me it was quite uncomfortable. There was barely any room to move around because I felt that the table was too close to me. I describe myself as an average build guy but tall, and it definitely wasn't working for me. Maybe if you're super petite, this seating will work for you.\n\nOverall this place is ok... Would I come back? Yeah maybe, if I'm dying for tacos (which is almost a rare to none occurrence)."

It was my husband's and I's first time there. We are not fans of this place at all. Infact, we'd be happy to send as many people away as we can! First off, we asked to be seated at the patio, which the hostess was happy to take us to. Though, they needed to clean a table for us. The hostess just left me standing in the middle of the patio and handed me all the menus (my husband and brother we're not at restaurant yet). I don't mind that I needed to wait for a clean table, but if it's not ready, have me wait up front not in the middle of people eating their food. Secondly, the table I was waiting for to be \"cleaned\" was filthy. Crumbs and STAINS all over the seats, hardened salsa all over the candle, as well as the menus! Gross. Looking past all that, it was turning into a nice evening. Until the manager came over and asked us to MOVE tables because he had a large party of VIPs that he neede to accommodate. Wow. Way to make us feel not important as your PAYING customers. We moved to just keep things simple (and we didn't want anyone to spit in our food). At least he comped us a round. Then our waiter came over to \"apologize\" and \"thank\" us for moving. He should have just kept his foot in his mouth because he casually tells us, \"I was suppose to get you guys out of here before 7 [we got there around 6:15], but you [my brother] ordered a meal that takes 25 min.\" And he's laughing about it like it's a joke. News flash, you basically told us you were told to rush us through our dining experience so we'd be done before the VIPs came, but were stopped because one of us ordered an inconvenient meal. And now the icing on the cake... I GOT FOOD POSIONING FROM THE SHRIMP TACOS. I was sick all night shortly after finishing that meal. \nWE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT INCONSIDERATE, POOR QUALITY, AND UNPROFESSIONAL RESTAURANT."

The concept is to \"share\" dishes, and all are brought out separately, which would be fine, if you were given plates to \"share \"your food with others. Other than my immediate family, I'm just not comfortable taking bites off someone else's plate. Trying to get an empty plate here was treated as inconceivable. After finishing 2 orders of tacos, 2 sides, an order of guacamole & chips, our 3rd side still hadn't appeared. When we asked about it, we were told that \"things just come out here when they're ready\". Call me crazy, but I'm just not into eating corn for dessert. I got the feeling that management just assumes that you are a tourist, and dismisses any concerns as irrelevant. The old adage, to \"assume makes an ass out of you & me\" seems fit here."

From the small plates we ordered the Camaroncitos al Chipotle and the Queso Fundido with the short ribs add on. They were served at the same time and our server Lanie recommended us to mix and match the sides and sauces from both dishes and have fun with it. What a genius! \n\nOther friends enjoyed the langosta (lobster) tacos special but I thought the special steak tacos with some sort of jalape\u00f1o dressing really stood out. \n\nThe Pollo a la Brasas is the dish for you if you enjoy amplified flavors of garlic and lime. This is the one dish that I tried in their New York location many moons ago and still dreamed about until I finally tasted it again at Red Rock. Also, PLANTAIN RICE. YES.\n\nOMFG this dessert... the baked bread pudding or something. Even being gluten conscious I couldn't stop eating.\n \nDefinitely recommend family style. We ordered a lot less than we thought we need to because the portions are actually not that small."

I liked the vibe of the restaurant and I like the idea of upscale Mexican food.\n\nI had the enchiladas with shrimp and green sauce. It came with three enchiladas and was relatively filling. I really liked the creamy green enchilada sauce and that avocado slices came on top. My husband went brunch and had huevos rancheros which was a very light dish. I sampled the red enchilada sauce and enjoyed that as well. We split chips with a trio of salsas. All of the salsas had great flavor and the hot salsa definitely packed some heat which I loved. \n\nI really wanted to try the tacos, but you are limited to one type of taco with the taco entree which was surprising since I've never seen this done before. I would have loved to be able to split between two types. We were told the dishes are meant to share so I'm guessing they do this to make you order more."

            "review": "The Pancita taco is outrageously awesome. Order it during Happy Hour (after 9PM) and get 2 tacos for $5.50. The Carne taco also great - tender and savory, almost Lengua-like.\n\nThe Camaron (shrimp) taco is slathered in what they call \"Chipotle Mojo\" sauce which is an orange-colored, Sunday sauce-like (but Mexican) curry-like concoction. It also makes an appearance on their nacho plates. The repurposing of this sauce on multiple menu items is questionable, and something about the look of it is a little off-putting. On the shrimp taco it completely shrouds the ingredients in an opaque orange layer. Close your eyes and it tastes alright, but the overall visual is somewhat IKEA-cafeteria-like. All tacos are served on skinny, rectangular plates, so aim your taco droppings well or you'll be saying \"Chipotle Uh-oh\" on yer pants.\n\nThe nachos have potential - served on a hot metal vessel atop a wooden plank. But I wish the nachos were made with 3X more warm hockey-game queso, like the famed Isla Nachos of pre-2013 Treasure Island days... Nacho Daddy is the closest you'll find these days.\n\nMercadito's Habanero salsa and other salsas on the side will be charged for to the tune of $3.50+, so heat-seekers be warned. The Habanero salsa itself lacks punch - probably the weakest Habanero heat I've experienced since the Habanero salsa craze started. Absolutely no comparison to the *free* secret Habanero served at Javier's.\n\nI'm a fan of the Mexican cocktail menu. The 'Misty Sleeve' was hibiscus-y and refreshing. At $10.50 though, it's all the money. A solid, standard Margarita will set you back $8.50. Not terribly pricey, but not five bucks.\n\nEnjoyed the warm 3-corn pico, but was hard to eat in a shallow glass bowl. Keeping the kernels from flying off the edge was challenging.\n\nCurrently running a pretty slangin' deal on Tuesdays for 'industry folk': 50% off your check!\n\nPrices are generally above-average for average Mexican fare. This place is trying to compete with the likes of Javier's (at Aria) but lacks the generous portions, go-for-it flavors, and beautiful plating/presentation. If you're gonna charge 5X-6X more than a taco stand, your food needs to please your palate at least 2X more. That's weird going-out-to-eat math, but ni modo!"

            "review": "\"The Best Thing To Come Out Of Mexico Since Salma Hayek\" Ehh, I don't know..but it is a solid 3 stars!\n\nMercadito is a fairly new Mexican restaurant located inside the Red Rock Casino. Inside is pretty unique as they've got some street style art hanging up, but it has a very classy, modern look and feel. It's not very big and when we came on a Saturday night around 8pm, it was packed. Maybe it wasn't the best idea to come at that time, but they had the music blaring so loud that it was more like a nightclub. I'm just not a huge fan of having to scream at someone a foot away from me.\n\nOn the menu, you'll find a lot of classic Mexican dishes, tacos and even some small, tapas style plates. They've got a pretty extensive tequila list, as well as signature cocktails. One of the coolest things about their menu is they offer several variations of house made salsas, guacamole and ceviche. We ended up ordering the salsa tasting which includes chips and 3 salsas of your choice, for only $3.50. Out of the 3 we chose, the roja was my least favorite as it just didn't have the bold flavor like the other 2 we got, tomatillo and chipotle. The tomatillo was perfect...salty, sweet and just the right amount of heat, and the chipotle had an amazing smoky taste without being too overpowering.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered the ceviche and while it was good, I feel like I just can't find an awesome ceviche in town. The citrus flavor was pretty spot on but with the addition of pineapple, it was a little sweeter than I like. None of the salsas that we had complimented it enough to give it the spicy kick I was looking for. In the pictures, it looks like a small plate but there's a ton of good sized, juicy shrimp in there and it's served with 2 big tostadas, which I wasn't a huge fan of. They had a real soft texture and I ended up using the chips for my ceviche more. We also ordered their take on mac & cheese, which is pretty strange but tasty. The manchego cheese flavor is really intense and I like the spiciness but throwing corn in there was weird, and threw the texture off.\n\nAs far as the service goes, they've got a lot to work on. Several times throughout the night, we were sitting with an empty glasses and had to flag someone down for a refill. One of the managers was just standing around chit-chatting with employees for the entire time we were there and the service just wasn't great. I might as well add that they don't serve regular iced tea here as well either. Since the prices are a bit on the higher side I won't be rushing back, but I enjoyed the food and there's enough \"ooh\" and \"aah\" items on the menu to get me back in the door, eventually."

            "review": "Okay, so all these bad reviews and I'm thinking, \"do I really want to go to an expensive, non-Mexican Mexican restaurant with bad service?\"  Well, it just so happens my relatives are staying at the Red Rock, and he wants to try it.  It looks cool, food looks good, and it's pretty busy inside.  $100 later, I'm pretty satisfied.  Really.\n\nWe ordered a carne and a camaron tacos, lobster tostadas, and both types of Ceviches along with the salsas.  Okay, didn't like them charging for the salsas, that was ridiculous.  But overall the food was really good!  The camaron and dorado ceviches were very different from each other, and could have used more lime.  Both tacos were great although they needed to take it easy on the sauce in camaron tacos.  The lobster tostadas were to die for.  Our server (don't recall his name) was very attentive and prompt (although orders were not exactly speedy), a decided departure from all the reviews I saw.\n\nAnd that got me to thinking... I've seen more than a few reviews where they mention that it's not very Mexican.  So, you want to go to a trendy Mexican TAPAS restaurant and you want traditional Mexican?  What's the point of that?  I believe experimenting with traditional flavors and making something other than traditional out of it is part of the experience and enjoyment.  Was this Mexican?  Not really.  Was it good?  Absolutely.  Is it expensive?  Yes, but so is every other tapas restaurant in, well, outside of Spain.  If you want a good tamale go to El Cholo.  Good tacos?  Go to El Taurino.  Okay both are in L.A. but you get the point.  You're not here to get REAL Mexican food.  \n\nGreat tasting NON-Mexican food, great atmosphere, great service (at least to me), and we have a 4-star restaurant.  Despite the $100 setback.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Actually, despite the trendiness and fast pace of the place, I think it might actually be not bad for a solo dinner.  They have a bar and it's a casino, so I don't see why not."

Even thought it was crowded, we were seated pretty quickly.  We decided to try the trio of salsas with chips.  You don't get a lot of any of the salsas, but that's probably best, because over indulging on chips and salsa is easy at Mexican places.  We had the tomatillo, chile de arbol, and roja.  All were good, but I preferred the tomatillo, which had a nice kick.  None were chunky, they were all blended to a nice consistency.  The server offered us more chips, but we didn't get any because we didn't want to overeat on chips.\n\nEach serving of tacos is around $12-$16 as I recall, and you get 4 small, street sized tacos per order.  My buddy had the carne, and I had the pastor.  The pastor was my favorite of the 2, the chili rubbed pork was tender but had a little crispiness.  But, I wasn't blown away by either taco.\n\nFor a side, we tried the mac n cheese, which is served with manchego cheese, chiles, and corn.  This was easily the best thing I ate at dinner.  It's not a thick sauce, but it has a ton of cheese flavor.  And, the chiles give it a nice kick.  I'd absolutely get this again were I to eat a Mercadito.  I'd return if I am in the area, but I certainly wouldn't make a special trip to Red Rock to eat here."

Me and the guy at the table next to me looked at each other as we're trying to get comfortable, like, are these things for real??!\n\nRaise the tables, quit trying to look chic and make it comfortable!"

We lucked out and it was still Happy Hour - we had shrimp, chicken, and carne asada tacos (these were our fav).  Also indulged in some chicken nachos and flan for dessert! However, can we talk about the MARGARITAS!!!! Strawberry, guava, blueberry, and pineapple...if I had it my way we would've ordered every drink on the menu. With some yummy spices on the glass-these were everything. \n\nWe will for sure be back! Can't wait to explore more of the menu."

Only true \"complaint\" would be no legit hot salsa,  despite habanero as an option (total weak sauce). For those like me, who like it HOT that was disappointing.  Otherwise its thumbs up for this Sex-Mex gem."

            "review": "I had a casino comp for Mercadito that had to be used before the end of December.  I came here last night to use the comp and see the place before it closes and is reopened under the Clique Hospitality Group in February. Hence, this review will make no difference in the Yelp world as the place will be closing as it is soon.  I was at Mercadito for a Yelp event when it first opened, but it was a small tasting of tacos and guacamole.\n\nService was excellent!  Tyler was on the ball and was very good at making suggestions or answering questions.  Given that I generally don't get tacos in a restaurant like this, I looked on the menu for other items.  I got the tortilla soup for a starter followed by Pollo a las brasas--Peruvian in origin--for the main course.  The tortilla coup was quite good with lots of chicken, some tortilla strips but not overwhelmed with them like some other places.  I ordered a half order of the chicken which ended up being four pieces of chicken--bone in--with a wonderful spicy coating.  It's appearance is why they refer to it as blackened chicken.  The chicken was served with rice and a side of black beans with cotija cheese.\n\nWhen it came to dessert, Tyler showed me the three item menu and said that the torrejas de bolillo was his favorite and he described it as a kind of Mexican bread pudding.  That's what I ordered and I was glad I did.  Rough cubes of Mexican bread soaked in cr\u00e8me anglaise with cajeta sauce and a scoop of ice cream.  The bread was baked in a cast iron round container.  It was a good way to end the meal.\n\nA good meal but definitely over-priced if you're spending your own coin.  The room is pleasant enough but it's a bit narrow in the area I was seated."

            "review": "Secrets out...I'm totally obsessed with this place and their awesome deals for industry locals! \n\nIf you are in the industry (show your ID and get a little 50%off card) Tues or anytime after 10pm you get 50% OFF! That puts these at taco stand prices for some high quality grub. The food is good, but getting anything at a deal just puts its over the edge to awesome town. If you aren't industry- that's okay, there's deals for everyone else too. There's happy hour daily 4-6 daily and reverse is sun-thur 10-12am, fri/sat 11-1am and taco tuesday specials after 9pm. \n\nSo we've taken advantage of this deal weekly since we've heard of it and have run a good range of the menu. So far, nothing has been bad though a few have been favorites. \n\nGUACAMOLE: \nThey have a solid traditional guac if you want to keep basic. The mango one has chunks of that and jicama it, but isn't too sweet and has good balance. The tocino has nice smokiness from bacon bits mixed in it. My fave is the tocino. I enjoy the chips they give you here, it's always warm and freshly fried.\n\nTACOS:\nLangosta- this was one of our favorites. Buttery creamy poached lobster with just a bit of seasoning, shallot and avocado on top. \nPancita- pork belly tacos are delicious! I really like the peach salsa on it with the chicarron, but the belly is tender and has a really nice spice on it. \nCamaron- has a nice chipotle rojo on it, but doesnt mask the shrimp. I like how they prepared this as it was also buttery and sweet like the lobster and the seafood still shined over the seasonings. \nEstilo Baja- pretty solid fried fish taco. Its one of the best ones I've had in this town, when I've been sorely disappointed. I'm a Cali girl who lived in San Diego so fried fish taco was a weekly thing for me there. \nPastor- it's good, but I prefer this the street cart way off the spit than cubed and seasoned pieces. I prefer the pancita over the pastor. \nCarne- the beef is tender and I really enjoy the jicama slaw on top.\n\nHavent had the hongos (mushroom), the espada (swordfish), and the pollo (chicken), but will update when I do. \n\nCEVICHE: \nThere are three kinds. I've had the mixto one which had a lovely passionfruit flavor to it, but I loved the dorado as the mahi mahi texture was just awesome, perfectly tender and fresh with the orange. These came with a thin crisp bread, but honestly I prefer the chips with them! \n\nSIDES: \nElote Mexicana- 1 whole corn, cut in half and put onto two skewers. I really like theirs as they cook their corn to where its easy to bite off. \n\nAGUAS FRESCAS/COCKTAILS: \nTheir aguas frescas are yummy! Out of the three, I enjoy the pineapple ginger one best as it's just so refreshing. The cocktails here are solid. We sampled several cocktails and all were well made, balanced and not skimpy on the booze as I felt it. \n\nLUNCH: \nLunch menu is slightly different as the entrees and some of the appetizers aren't on the menu. They offer tortas and tacos are 3 a order instead of 4. Ceviche, salsas, drinks are all the same.\n\nWe tried a estilo baja torta as we enjoyed these as tacos. I like that they thoroughly grill up their bread so that it was crisp and did not get soggy at all. I love tortas, but so many places do it injustice by allowing it to disintegrate in 60 seconds. It was also fairly large and came with nicely crispy fries seasoned with what reminds me of lucas powder. \n\nService has been pretty good here. Our first night the server was fantastic when we came alone and chatted us up even about Vegas as we finished our dessert. As a group the server was decent with a few slip ups as it got busy. Lunch server was super friendly, bubbly and pretty good about checking on us. One of the managers recognized us and came up to greet us with welcome back and asked what we've been enjoying. \n\nJust a note that if you're a heat wimp, let them know. I've had a few servings that was somewhat mild and another that had some medium heat of the same item. I love spicy, but I can see how this can be bothersome to someone who can't do any spice.\n\nAfter three solid meals, it deserved the 5 star rave. I think we are going to keep on coming until we get burnout or until the deal stops being this amazing. The food though is totally up my alley. It's got flavor and freshness that reminds me of some of my favorite places in SoCal and in Baja."

My mouth is watering just thinking about my meal. The Margaritas could easily be on someone's top 5 list. \n\n\nWe ended our evening with the bread pudding skillet. This could have been a little sweeter, thankfully the scoop of ice cream helped that. Perhaps a bit of honey on top or agave would be a nice touch to that dish. I would order it again though despite it not being as sweet as I personally like."

The only things that were still good were the chips and swordfish tacos. The service was poor the food seemed old and/or poorly prepared and the prices have gone up since the opening. I even showed our waiter that the tacos that he recommended were uneatable full of fatty pork. We will not be returning or recommending any more!!! Hope the next restaurant opening at Red Rock is much better! T\n\n\nTheir Response: Hi Terri. We are sorry that your most current visit was not the service or quality you have previously received with Mercadito. We thank you for your feedback and will be addressing your points with the kitchen and staff. Please reconsider coming back in the future. Please note: Most definitely, the prices have not increased since opening\n\nMy response:  The prices at Happy Hour on Tacos and Margaritas went from 5.50 to 6.50.  The waitress when we commented said they were testing the market and adjusted the prices.\n\nCannot even give 1 star anymore.  The only things palpable re the swordfish tacos and the chips.

We were sat at a table that had dirty napkins stuffed into the pillows. We we're offered water right away but never approached by a server. It didn't even seem that busy. We sat for about 10min before we decided that we wanted to leave.\n\nThe most annoying thing was that the server at the table right next to us checked on the table several times while we sat there.

The lady of the night declared a hankering for mexican, do we decided to try Mercadito.\n\nService was great, and the food and drink were good, but the reason this one drops to 3 stars instead of 4 is that price point. The Guacamole, while totally and utterly delicious, was $8.50 for a small ice cream scoop that we demolished in about nine seconds. Salsa, while also very yummy, cost an extra $3. All the tacos were about $14, of which we tried 4 different ones (there were 4 of us, so one each) the Baja, pastor, carne and pork belly. They were all really quite good, my least favorite was the Mahi mahi, which came out a bit too sweet for my palette, and my favorite, which I could see myself going back for, was the Carne. The slaw that topped it, just a perfect accent to the smoky meat. \n\nOur group also had 4 different margaritas, and I am firmly convinced that the one I tried, the \"little market\" (mercadito) was by far the best. I would buy the salt they rimmed that glass in by the bucket, tomorrow. \n\nOur very very nice server also brought birthday girl a birthday flan on the house, which tickled her pink. Looked delicious; she did not let me try it. So I assume it was so.\n\nSo why only three stars? Because for literally less than half the price, I could get food that was just as delicious at Tacos el Gordo, Taco y Taco, or one of the other great \"authentic\" taco places in town. It's geared towards low key, date night drinkies and noshing, but the only items that are really priced to make that affordable are the drinks. You're very obviously paying for the trendy vibe and Red Rock Casino location. I can see myself coming back here for a \"taco tuesday\" or with a groupon; something that brings the price down, but otherwise, it's a little out of the price range to move from \"rare occasion\" to \"regular haunt\"."

We had the steak w/ slaw and the pork w/ pineapple.  We also ordered all 3 guacamole options with 3 different salsas.  The salsa isn't a chunky consistency..it's meant to drizzle on the chips with a spoon.  The chips were cold and very thick.  Not the kind of salsa you can dig into with your chips. They are trying to make the tacos fancy instead of concentrating on the flavors.  The iced tea is terrible-it's like a sangria.  Instead of having 3 mediocre guacamoles...start with 1 and nail it.  Once you master that you can move on and create more.  Get better chips and go back to the drawing board w/ your salsa selections and tacos.  Service was great.  Never ever returning! YUCK!\n\nWASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  Also, a waste of space...once again another restaurant to FAIL in this space at Red Rock.  \n\nIf you are looking for tasty guacamole...head to Cantina Laredo. They make table side guacamole right in front of you and you can tell them exactly what you want in it.\n\nIf you are dying to try this place like we were or someone has twisted your arm into going......I suggest you sit outside and just order alcohol and nothing else.  I can't stress enough that the outdoor area is the only good thing about Mercadito."

She sent me a $100 gift card to give them a second chance. I do believe in second chances and the $100 gift card, well, that sealed the deal. \n\nWhen we came back, we were greeted pretty much the same way we were initially in terms of being quoted a \"45-minute to an hour wait\" and give me your phone number and we'll text to you. Having flashbacks, I let my husband take the wheel on that. The place didn't look overly crowded like it did during our last, ill-fated trip, but, it was a Friday night. Hey, I'm a reasonable person, I don't get carte blanche treatment. So we waited at the overpriced bar across the way in the center of the casino (forgot the name).  The bartenders working that night look like two Skinamax soft core porn stars, completely un-interested in serving drinks to anyone who isn't playing $100 credit in video poker. I nursed my drink, while I watched my husband play (since I was sitting at the $100 credit video poker machine). It had been at least 30 minutes and I didn't feel like sucking another weak Mandarian and soda down. After my husband played his machine out, we went back to the restaurant to check the status of our names. They replied it would be another 30 minutes, which would've made it an hour. I got the old sick feeling back as we grumbled our breaths and walked back out the door. Then, something miraculous happened: my husband got texted from a number we didn't know and it ready: \"Your table is now ready\". Holy shit! They actually do text it in!\n\nNeedless to say, the Mr. and I drank and ate ourselves silly on that date night. I enjoyed the house maggies (margaritas), I personally enjoy adding a little to heat (serranos) to mine, which if you like a little spice, ask for the heat. You can also order them fruity (blueberry, strawberry, etc). But for me, the food was just okay. It's set up tapas style to share, and I don't mind that concept. You definitely don't go hungry, that's for sure. I believe the night that we re-visited, we shared chicken nachos, my husband also ordered the special which was a kobe burger and I had ceviche, guac and flautas and I was completely stuffed. I don't think I finished eating the flautas...had to save room for one more of those fab maggies. \n\nAll in all, I felt that the service was excellent, the maggies were delicious, and the food was okay. It was definitely worth my trip to use that generous gift card. I would go back for the maggies and stick to the apps part of the menu. This is definitely a good place for a few friends who just want drinks and apps before a movie."

Shared the shrimp enchiladas which came on a regular sized plate, but when asked for another larger plate was told by our server she wasn't supposed to give out any larger plates but would since they weren't too busy.

While we were mulling over our restaurant choices, Mercadito's was suggested! Mercadito's is an award winning restaurant that comes to the Red Rock Resort and Casino from Chicago-it's won quite a few awards including Zagat & this is their first venture in Las Vegas.  Even thou it opened it's doors the end of June, the official opening was over the Fourth of July & our event was planned for the following Friday, July 11th-humm, a new place in a casino on a friday?!? PERFECT!  Now, I need to say that there were nine of us (we are never really sure how many will show up-which makes it VERY difficult to make reservations-one time only three appeared--how embarrassing!) Ok, back to the review--The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner & offers an industry day as well as Happy Hour-since lunch seating starts at 11:30am, we arrived a little early. As the hostess unlocked the door, we were waiting & went right in--she inquired about our reservation--NO, so sorry, we didn't have one! Would she turn us away? Did it matter? After a little whispering and a few minutes, we were seated. They pushed three tables together so all nine of us could sit together. YEAH! Since we had never been to Mercadito's & we weren't sure what to expect, we did what any uneducated patron would do-we put our food choices into our server's hands-what did he recommend? OF course we had to try some salsa--we ordered the rojo salsa suggested by Brian-YUMM! It was a CREAMY salsa with fresh tomatoes, garlic, & onions and it came with the BEST tortilla chips that I've ever tasted! I swear, the chips were perfect-crispy, with just the right amount of salt-I really could've sat & consumed basket after basket of chips! The drinks-expecially the margaritas-were just the right size & prepared with top shelf tequila! The lunch entrees were served family style--NOT family size! In other words, I ordered the pollo tacos, one of my co-workers ordered the blackened swordfish tacos, & another ordered the crispy magi-mahi tacos & we shared--that way we each had the opportunity to taste all three! They were excellent! One of my other co-worker ordered the carne tacos & liked them SO MUCH that he ordered a second plate to take home for dinner! Beans & rice are available but they DON'T come with the lunch-I found that they weren't necessary anyway-three tacos and the chips & salsa were more than enough. They also offer tortas- a tasty mexican sandwich that's available with your choice of either a side salad or fries-fries like I've NEVER tasted before-delicious lemon lime fries. I actually would've been thrilled to simply sit & eat tortilla chips & lemon-lime fries! When we were finished, (I swear I saw one co-worker licking his plate!) each & every one of us were so stuffed that there wasn't any room for dessert--Oh NO, that means that we'll have to go back!  Do I recommend this restaurant? DEFINITELY! will I visit again? OF COURSE! Yes, the food was a little pricey but, NOT outrageously so! If you want tacos for a BUCK, you go to Taco Bell--however, keep in mind-you get what you pay for-but, if you want an excellent taco in a trendy NEW establishment, check out \"MERCADITO's\"--you won't regret it!"

We were so excited we try to go as soon as we noticed there was something going on inside! Well it turns out that it was the employees training. \"OK that's awesome\" I'm thinking to myself. This means we are really close! We were given a nice card that entitles us to 50 percent off our first visit . \"Cool\". \n\n\nSo we go back on a Wednesday or Thursday in late June. Like i mentioned the very first week. We are greeted by a nice enthusiastic host and are seated and given 2 menus.  After taking a good look at the menu we decided to go with a \"plate\". Before i go on. I will mention they have several different plates to choose from. The carne asada plate was not available. They ran out of carne. Ok, that's disappointing but i will survive. I'm in the mood for enchiladas (as always). Before i go any further i will mention a plate costs $22.\n\n Oh look they have an option for my choice of \"any 2 plates\"  it's twice as much ($44) which just happens to come with 2 enchiladas! WOW! . One of their regular \"plates\" must easily fill up one person. Let's go with the 2 plate option and share! So we decide to get the $44 plate and we go with the chicken and the green pepper thing (whatever it was called). All set. \n\nSo our order is placed. My girlfriend leaves to go and finish up her make up in the ladies room and i am left alone, so I decide to put the ball game on which was near complete. So I'm thinking nothing of it enjoying the game on my smart device. Gf getting ready still. Game ends gf finally makes it back. We are about 30 minutes in at this time. Sweet our food must be just about ready! \n\nAnother couple comes in and is seated right next to us even though there are tons of seats available. So they are seated given menus order their food. We now kid around and say they must have had to kill the chicken. About 15 minutes roughly goes by. Oh what do you know their food is brought out and they begin to enjoy their dinner. Even they must have been wondering where our food was. Well our server was nice enough to pop by and say \"5 more minutes'. \" OK good\"   starved at this point. \n\n15 minutes later our $44, 2 plate mercadito special finally arrives. One small plate is placed on our table. So i ask our server i said we ordered the 2 plate thing. He was quick to let me know that it was all there. He said that's how it comes. There was a green pepper thing and a chicken breast and two small enchiladas and a very small amount of rice . So as hungry as i am i am very upset at this point because not only did i just wait an hour for this thing. It was supposed to be worth the wait and enough food for 2. Well not even close. The enchiladas which was the only thing i really cared about were dry and just not very good as far as restaurant enchiladas go. Let me say the food on the plate was garnished nicely. So it looked good just didn't taste very good. The chicken was ok. My gf ate all of the green pepper thing. She said that was ok. \n\nSo it turns out the 2 plate thing for twice the money is actually their Mexican outrageously priced version of a dish similar to olive garden's \"tour of Italy\".  \n\nNow we did mention to our server that we thought the 2 plate thing would be enough for 2 people. Well not even close. At this point they can see we are not happy and our server brings over another generic plate with chicken and rice on it and says \"compliments of the chef\" as nice as a gesture it was, it was too little too late. Maybe if i didn't wait an hour for my food. After all it wasn't even busy by any means. \n\nI have come to conclusion that if you go to mercadito and order some tacos and tequila you will probably have a great time. In fact its the only thing i would ever even bother with. So in conclusion if you are in the mood for a taco this is a great option. Just stay away from everything thing else on the menu. In case you are wondering the couple that were seated next to us ordered the tacos (which looked good) and damn near left before our food arrived. Bad place? Not necessarily. Bad experience? Very. At least we brought our 50 percent off coupon."

Got waters poured, server greeted us quickly and gave us the rundown of the restaurant. Ordered a couple draft beers and they were ice cold! :)\nThe food is meant to be shared. I feel it is Tapas style with Mexican flare. Traditional style guacamole was excellent. Ordered a trio of salsas and they were very good as well. For the main course we had swordfish and ongo veggie tacos. You get 4 small street tacos per order. They were both extremely good and definitely different than a traditional style Mexican restaurant. A little pricey but the food atmosphere and service were all excellent. Also they did have happy hours prices and deals but you had to sit in the bar area.  The only negative was the tables were small and we sat very close to others. One side was a bench seat and the other a chair. We literally had conversations with both tables around us because it was like \nwe were all eating together. :("

Food could use a pinch of salt thou.\nBeing in this industry (food and beverage) forever, I obviously always pay close attention to the service.\nI agree that music is kinda loud sometimes.  The first time my boyfriend and I were there we were pretty much yelling to our waitress to get our orders. \nLast nite we went there at 10 pm... We got sat outside right away (we had a reservation).  We sat at the high tables outside because the music is not as loud as when you are sitting on the little couches/tables. \nOur waitress came to say hi pretty fast and ask us if we were there before and give us some time to decide.  She came back in about 5 minutes... By that time we already knew our appetizer order. She took our appetizer order and started putting her notepad away... like we were done ordering.  We had to let her know that we were ordering drinks too. She took the notepad out again and wrote down our drink order... put the notepad away and went to take our menus. We had to stop her and let her know we were gonna order entrees when we made a choice. I know everybody here in yelp doesn't wait tables but I've done this too long so it's kinda hard to overlook at details like that (I never leave a table without trying to upsale drinks and apps/salads).\nWe get our drinks... my drink came without a straw... I know it's not a big deal but I really don't like drinking from restaurant glassware without one. Good thing was is that when I came in I had an almost empty drink from the casino so I used those straws. My boyfriend order a Mexican beer... She didn't bother to bring a cold glass or even asked if he wanted one... oh and no lime either... it's a Mexican beer come on! So we had to stop her to get a glass and a lime.\nBefore we order I had a question about an item... How it came out... I'm pretty sure she didn't know the answer because her reply was... \"yeah I'm pretty sure\". Good thing it wasn't anything related to an allergy cause I could be dead lol. \nI don't know, maybe she was having an off nite or something. I had good service there before, not exceptional but plain good.\nWe asked for a box and she brought the check right away... Not asking about desserts or coffee or another drink or anything. We gave her our industry card so she had to take the check back to get it discounted. After that she forgot to bring us the check back so after 7-10 minutes we had to flag her down for it... And then we had to flag her one more time to actually pay.\nOur original check was almost $100... kinda expensive, and I would expect better service considering price and location. But because we have the industry card we can overlook at things like that. But I would definitely not go in there too often if I didn't get a discount."

The server did not formerly introduce herself, when I told her where I worked her response was, \"Rad\"? I guess I expected a little more professionalism from a fancy restaurant. My mom than proceeded to ask her if they offer a happy hour, she stated that they did and referred to the card sitting on the table and said its either the happy hour price or the 50% off. She explained it so rudely with such an attitude it made us uncomfortable to ask any questions after that. She was very short, unfriendly, and very unprofessional. At the end after receiving my check there was only a 30% discount applied, I asked her why it is not the 50% her response was the card was old and they only do the 30% discount now, don't you think that would of been appropriate to tell us when we first asked and showed her the card instead of leading us to believe otherwise?

I really shouldn't because I feel as if the secret gets out, it will get harder to get into these, but it's such a good experience I do want to yelp it.  Ok, here goes: once a month on a Monday Mercadito has cooking classes.  I have been twice, and they are fantastic.  The first time I went was in May, and it started a little late, but for $45 we got a plate of pineapple guac, (with a full size cocktail), queso (with a full size cocktail) salmon tacos (with a full size cocktail), chili relleno (with a full size cocktail) and dessert.  Were you counting that?  That is like five courses with four full size coctails, for $45 plus tax and tip.  O-M-G.  Can you believe that?  The second class I went to seemed a little more disorganized, but that was because they decided that we should cook certain courses.  So this time we had mango guac, but we had to make it (that's ok, it's a cooking class) lobster ceviche (which we had to make) then a slider with french fries, a piece of fish, amazing tres leches cake, and four full size cocktails.  Seriously.  One of the best deals in town.  Oh, and this last time they gave us little containers of the rimming salts/sugers used in the drinks.  I have a feeling I am going to regret letting this secret out, they will get more crowded and I won't get a seat.  But, I LOVE this experience.

This is the best Mexican I've had. We've been twice with equally impressive visits. The first time we ate at the bar, the second visit we brought our son (4) so we sat in the dining room.\nThe Margaritas are great and don't miss the Paloma(tequila and grapefruit juice).  Between the two visits we sampled most of the tacos, salsas and ceviche. All great. My son had the children's chicken tacos which he loved. The only draw back is that they squeeze bottled sour cream all over the tacos which made them very messy but he liked them non the less. The flautas are also delicious. The small guac is more than the two of us could eat. Creamy, rich and just perfectly spiced. \nIf I had to find something negative, I guess our server was a little pushy but as a server myself i guess I can see where she's coming from but she needs to learn how to balance suggestions with upsells. \nWe'll be back and I look forward to bringing the inlaws to see what they think of the place."

You get for tacos for each order not sure if you can mix and match. I also ordered the chips with 3 different salsa's it was a small portion of salsa but there were 5 or 6 types all delicious.\n\nThe best part I'd they have industry night all day Tuesdays and happy hour from 4 to 6. Great atmosphere great service, and a cool relaxed feel!"

We sat outside on both occasions and our waiter was very attentive even with the patio being absolutely packed! The guacamole and salsa trios are amazing. We've ordered many things off the menu so here are my recommendations: Lobster Tacos are delicious but really spicy. They come with a jalepeno sauce that I might not ask for next time. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice but my husband loves it. Shrimp Enchiladas with green sauce. So creamy, so soft so... heavenly. Comes with sliced avocado on top. My husband got their Mercadito Cheeseburger and it came with these rosemary fries and a side of that spicy jalepeno sauce. He loved it. The margaritas are outstanding. I believe someone makes fresh juice for each one. You can add heat to it if you want. Again, I'm a spice wimp so I haven't tried it. \n\nNote: this restaurant brings your food as it is ready. Don't be surprised if someone gets their food before you. I recommend your party orders apps and small plates to share so that the food just keeps on coming."

I totally should have tried this place earlier!\n\nTheir chips and guacamole was ridiculous - super fresh and had so many ingredients in there including sweet potatoes and... bacon! mmmm\n\nThen the fish tacos and shrimp tacos... these days we only order seafood tacos whenever available, and theirs were simply amazing. One of the best Americanized tacos I've ever had.\n\nAnd when we finished and asked our server a box... he brought us a fresh bag of chips!

From their multitude of draft and frozen cocktails to their tacos that are oh so original. \n\nThey are currently only open for dinner but will be opening for lunch on the 7th of July and on July 21st for Brunch. They will serve brunch from 11:30am-3:00pm, Lunch hours will be 11:30am-4:00pm. Dinner starting at 4pm everyday. \n\nI sampled the pina and toreado guacamoles and both were fresh and fabulous! The toreado has a curry type flavor which an article by Seven recently stated it was Maggi. Yum! Definitely the umami taste they are hoping you will have. \n\nI also had a Carnitas de Puerco taco which is braised pork belly, seared til crispy on the outside and a fresh and crispy slaw. The sauce on this was so yummy!  As well as the Pollo taco...chicken, corn and avacado. What more can you ask for on a taco. NO hot sauce required. The flavors are definitely unique. \n\nOn to the best part....cocktails!!! (We did not have beer but they have the usual suspects) The have the new fad of draft cocktails, we had the Cheeky Cheeky Boom Boom, sure to make you cheeky  with vodka and elderflower liqueur. Oh man! Just so good! We also had The Turista, tequila, grapefruit, cherries. The ingredients say there is Black Pepper Syrup and BBQ Bitters in this drink and I would not have ordered it thinking they would be too overwhelming....they were not and I didn't know that until I reviewed the menu. It was a great drink, the grapefruit wasn't too sour, nice light taste. The cherries in this drink really make it a treat. We had samplings of so many other cocktails, they were all good.  But my least favorite was the Pepino el Pyu, a frozen cocktail made with cucumber. It was strong! But that wasn't the down fall the down fall, for me, was the cucumber but that's a personal preferance. The salt rimmings on the glasses are all awesome too! Very creative flavors. \n\nThe staff was super nice and friendly, very outgoing, The crowd enjoyed everything and I think most of us will be new regulars. \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood!"

I don't mind loud places but this place has the worst echo, you can't even hear the music playing.

The ambiance and service were great, but in all honestly, I wouldn't consider rushing my return. I was rather annoyed that the mediocre salsa and chips were not complimentary and had to be bought. Actually, the freshly made chips alone were fresh and the highlight of the evening - but that's saying more than enough. \n\nHere's what we tried:\nQueso fundido - baked chihuahua and oaxaca cheese, corn tortillas with short ribs $9.50. The cheese hardened immediately when it was brought to us, making the dish awkward to serve. They gave us a bare amount of short ribs; not to mention, the short ribs were bland and got lost in the hard cheese. Expensive, considering the amount of food they provide you with. Flavor rating 2/5\n\nTacos estilo baja - beer battered mahi mahi, chipotle aioli, Mexican style slaw $14.50. A major letdown. The menu advertised \"crispy\" beer battered - yet the fish were all super soggy once we received it. Also, the flavor profile was extremely basic; There was nothing memorable or unique about these tacos. The chipotle aioli didn't pop with flavor. It was flavorless, fell apart and nearly inedible. Also, the high price point, weak flavor, and small portion size of each taco didn't make any sense to me. I felt extremely misled and ripped-off. Flavor rating: 1/5\n\nThe Elote $4.50 (half an ear) oh man, was I deceived! The corn barely had any seasoning or cheese on it, super plain and even the corn kernels were tiny, not juicy and not very sweet. I would never recommend ordering this. Half of a corn for $4.50 has to be some cruel joke. Flavor rating: 0/5\n\nWe also had the \"salsa tasting\" with chips for $3.50 - they bring out the tiniest little dishes ever imaginable, that barely held any salsa in it. I mean, really, 2 dips and that's it? The tomatillo was our favorite as it was the most flavorful out of the bunch and then the habanero was our second favorite - I personally wished the habanero was spicy, but the flavor grew on me slowly as I continued to eat it. The chipotle and chile de arbol were too similar in taste for us to be able to distinguish between the two. The salsas were overall lacking a lot of flavor. Let's just put it this way; I've definitely had much better (cough: El Dorado Cantina). Flavor rating 3/5\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I wouldn't recommend Mercardito for bright or authentic flavor. For flavorful Mexican cuisine, generous portions, with a great bang for your buck, I would highly recommend trying El Dorado Cantina - their salsa and chips are extremely fresh and flavorful (plus they're complimentary!) Also their menu offerings are created with a lot of soul and ton of flavor. Mercardito? I'll press the snooze button on that one."

The 3 of us squeezed into what is essentially a 2-top with a wrap-around banquette.  The seating in general is extremely tight and the noise level was ridiculous.  I'm was actually quite hoarse the next day.  The food was very good to excellent and the margaritas were done just right.  The servers (we were tag-teamed) were quite good and did make some worthy recommendations but they were definitely trying to rush us to free up the table.  Speaking of that tiny table,  your plate is extremely small and the serving dishes are long and thin.  Trying to fit everything on that table is like doing a jigsaw puzzle.  The interior design is not well though-out, to say the least.  If you don't come on taco tuesday/ industry night (50% off everything for stations employees), you will pay an arm and a leg for the food.  That food is authentic Mexican so don't expect tex mex. I almost took off a star for the aforementioned problems but, in the end, the food won out over the decibel level.  I would come back for lunch on any day other than tuesday. Dinner would require more food and therefore lots more spending so that's not something I would consider.  I cannot understand the multitude of bad reviews that criticize the food.  Obviously this is subjective but you can't condemn the food because you don't understand it.  The servers ask DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENU?  To the confused diners: THAT would be the time to speak up!  If you don't like something, send it back.  Better yet, go to a tex mex chain restaurant and order a combo platter."

The staff friendly and attractive. The food though, is dismal.\n\nI had hoped for a more high-end fine dining Mexican food experience. Unfortunately, this food doesn't even rise to the level of the fast food Mexican joint in the food court of the same hotel.\n\nThe trio of guacamoles is interesting and probably the best thing here, but none is exceptional. Our enchiladas were overcooked to the point they were just mush. My wife had the fish tacos which were unexceptional. \n\nThe steak tacos deserve a special mention. If you ever find yourself in need of material to repair your shoe, I would recommend the meat from these tacos since it would take a chainsaw to permeate it. I called the server over and demonstrated how you could stretch the meat to 3x its size and it would snap back into its original shape. The server asked the chef who told her he only uses whatever cut he uses. My guess is that it was the lowest grade approved for human consumption. This is odd since the best beef to be found in the city is less than 1,000 feet southeast of this restaurant. If we had paid, we would have asked not to - something that has happened maybe once in 3 years.\n\nThis is too bad. They have everything they need here to make a landmark restaurant... Location, staff, buildout... (That's why it gets two stars instead of one), but the food sucks. It doesn't even rise to \"taco truck\" level. I feel nothing but sorrow and despair for those that have given this restaurant 4 and 5 star reviews - it is baffling. I've been here twice. I love Mexican food, but I can't do it again, even if it is free."

What you will find are some of the best, tastiest and juicyest soft tacos you've ever tried this side of la linea. (Border)\n   This is an upscale modern Mexican restaurant, nice hip marble top bar and some very nice original art pieces throughout the restaurant. A nice patio area with rattan furniture and giant parasols for a nice outdoor dining experience.\n\n  Sat at the bar and service was decent. This time I got the espada (swordfish) tacos and the ceviche mixto, both items were on the miniature size but the flavors were grande! not enough to fill me up but just enough to be satisfied. Can't wait to try so many other options on the menu that sounded very promising. \n\n  Back to value..It is kind of odd sitting at the bar at a Mexican restaurant order some drinks and not being offered chips and salsa, and even though cheap food shouldn't be expected here, with prices being a little bit over the comfort zone for tacos throwing in some complimentary chips and salsa shouldn't kill you, but skimping might, besides no restaurant ever in the history of Mexican restaurants ever charged extra for salsa! That's like the taco law, free salsa for all tacos.\n\n The good and the reason for 4 stars... Happy hour is between 4 to 6 pm on weekdays and also late happy hour from 10 to 12am, also on Tuesdays they offer 50% off for all industry employees, automatically turning Tuesdays into my most anticipated day of the week surpassing Game of Thrones Sundays.\n They advertise as being the best thing that came out of Mexico after Salma Hayek. I could think of many other things, but is 4 20 am and I have to get to bed.\n\n See you on Tuesdays or on happy hours... I'll bring my own DelScorcho salsa."

            "review": "This is by far the best Mexican food I have ever eaten! This is huge for me to say because I am from California and consider myself to be quite a Mexican food snob. I love the salsa selections. The guacamole is amazing! Their tacos are extremely unique and unbelievably good. I have no idea what these people are ordering that say the food is flavorless. I was quite shocked when I read those reviews. The only thing that maybe could use a little more seasoning is the chips if you like salt (they are still delicious). Everything tastes fresh, flavorful and high quality. I do prefer to go to happy hour or ladies night out to save some cash. The food is a little pricey outside of these specials. Ladies night out is extra fun because you have the best odds in Las Vegas to actually win a good prize (Although one time they forgot to give me a raffle ticket so that was a bummer)! I live in Henderson and I desperately wish that they would open the Green Valley location. They have been teasing us for over a year now saying that they would. It is probably better that they haven't because I would be there all the time! For now I will happily drive across town to eat here. I rarely take my time to review any businesses but I have to say this one is amazing!"

I heard good things about the gourmet street tacos at mercadito and tried it about a week ago. Although the happy hour drinks were tasty I was disappointed when it came to the tacos we tried. I felt the pork was chewy and lacked flavor. The service left a bit to be desired as well. Our waiter seemed ready for us to leave and hovered at our table after placing the check. Overall, I was kinda disappointed because I love most restaurants at red rock."

The service was not friendly or welcoming even from the management. All of the salsas are small at $2.50 each (enough for just two people at best) and none of them are spicy according to our server. The three tacos on the plate at $11.50 a plate felt like a ripoff because they were so tiny. The side of rice and beans had no Mexican flavors whatsoever and were very bland. Sorry, we won't be back. And if anyone would have asked us how our meal was at any point through our meal, they very well could have won our business back by showing some care and concern.

I want more.\n\n4) Large plate - Short rib enchiladas with red sauce. YUM! so good!\n\nWe didn't get any drinks, but I can't wait to come back to try the margaritas and the \"Little Market\" drink.

Happy Hour is only available in the bar/lounge/patio.Our group of five reserved a booth in the main dining room. \nOur server Xavier was very enthusiastic and attentive. He demonstrated his passion for food with his knowledge and thorough explanation of the menu and specialty dishes.\n\nThe traditional version of Guacamole was the starter. It is served with chips and salsa. The Guacamole was creamy with a slight amount of heat. The portion was large enough for all of us. Many of the dishes are great for sharing, such as the four Tacos Camaron served on corn tortillas. The pork was tasty and the slice of avocado provided a smooth finish. \nThe next sharing was the Taquizas Brochetas. This dish consisted of several items on skewers, Grilled Shrimp, Grilled Skirt Steak and Smoked Chicken served with corn tortillas on the side along with three sauces chimichurri, salsa toreada and a mole. Each of these were excellent and a pared with a great choice of sauces.\n\nFinally the holiday special was ordered by the majority. Chile's en Nogada is essentially a Chile in walnut sauce. It consists of a poblano pepper, walnuts, pork loin, thick cream, onion, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, apple, plantain and raisins.  It's topped w/pomegranate seeds & cilantro.  It was not very spicy, but divine.\n\nOne choice missing from the menu was flour tortillas. Mercadito only serves corn.\nThey also should increase the variety of wine wines by adding a Riesling.\nThe Margarita Tradicional was a perfect balance, just delicious.\n\nThe dessert choices were interesting and tempting but were passed for another visit that may start with dessert."

I went this Saturday night  and wow you could tell I wasnt the only one who read that article because for the summer time in vegas this place was jumping. After I grabbed a couple  margaritas at the bar which the bartender informed me on U.S. today rating them one of the top 10 margaritas in the country and at first i was skeptical but you could tell it wasn't a regular margaritas it was a Cadillac so it was definitely worth the 8$.\n \n   After 30-45min we finally got our table in the dining room ( which I regretted not getting a table out on their patio because the weather was great) . Immediately our water  glasses were being filled and our server Matt was there to greet us. This was my wife and I's first time so we planned on giving him a hard time and asking alot of questions but sure enough just like the margaritas i was proven wrong he was very knowledgeable and even though you could tell he had alot of other tables  since it was so busy he still showed us a great time. For starters we had the traditional guacamole with the tomatillo salsa , the guacamole was amazing we felt like the salsa was small with no refills which was a bummer. For our main course I had the shrimp tacos and my wife had the beer battered mahi mahi tacos I was a lil disappointed at first that you could not mix and match because I really wanted to try there pastor tacos but we had ordered some mexican corn on the cobb too and we needed to save room for dessert. What can I say? The tacos more than  lived up to the hype I dont know which one I liked more all I know is that I haven't had tacos ive enjoyed that much in a very long time. The mexican corn was icing on the cake I recommend no matter what you get an order of the corn on the cobb all I can say is WOW. For dessert we had the coconut flan which was delicious but it was very small only like 4 bites which I guess was fine because it saved room for two more of their margaritas we added guava this time on Matt's reccomendation .\n \n Mercadito is very much like a mexican tapas restaurant which I love tapas so I knew I was going to love this  place. I dont recommend bringing your kids on a Saturday night its too loud and too busy but I do recommend having matt as your server and  bringing anyone you would like to impress."

The have no sugar free drinks except Diet Pepsi. The waitress suggested water. Next we ordered the shrimp ceviche.  When it arrived we asked for pepper. We were told they don't have salt or pepper.  Took one bite of the overpriced ceviche and spit it out.  It was tiny, overpriced, and doused in some sweet red sauce that tasted like sugar water.  We told our waitress we couldn't eat there and walked out.  Huge disappointment, horrible food, and the service was pretty bad too.  Go to the Yardhouse and you will never be disappointed."

            "review": "My friends who live in Chicago RAVE about Mercadito. My friend who lives in Summerlin raved about this location. So, naturally, when I was coming into town for New Years, we decided to have dinner here! The NYE Sharing Menu after a certain time was 40 dollars per person for a ridiculous amount of food (and even later, you had the option of reserving a table for more money per person which included food, an open bar, and a midnight toast). We opted for the 40 dollar sharing menu. This included 2 guacs or salsas, 2 small plates, 4 tacos, 2 sides, and a dessert. \n\nWe tried the following:\n* Habanero Salsa - I was nervous from the name that it would be too spicy for me but it was delicious with the perfect amount of a kick to it! I wish I could have had a bowl of it! \n* Traditional Guac - actually tasty! All too often, I get to mexican restaurants where I have to add salt and salsa to their \"guac\" because it's just smashed avocado, but Mercadito's guac was extremely tasty and perfectly seasoned!\n* Flautas - probably my least favorite item that we tried, but was still pretty good, just not as flavorful as everything else we tried.\n* Nachos - probably one of my FAVORITE items that we tried!! So delicious, a generous portion and the perfect amount of every toppings!\n* Tacos - we tried the Hongos, Pollo, Cameron, and Carne tacos - I don't really eat much meat, but tried all of them and my faves were the hongos and pollo! We figured we would pick 4 tacos and get one of each to share- but we got 8 total tacos... needless to say this was a ridiculously large meal and we were ridiculously full ;) \n* arroz y frijoles - black beans and rice. Kind of on the plainer side, but still subtly tasty! \n* roasted poblano cauliflower - SPICY and super tasty!! Highly recommend if you're a cauliflower fan!\n\nWe ordered a few margaritas as well. Their marge are great and you have the option of adding smoke, adding heat, or adding fruit. I added heat to one of my margs and it definitely gave it a kick - pretty good, just not something I usually expect in a marg, so my second one was without heat. Overall, the margs were strong and delicious! \n\nThe service was on point for the most part! It took a while for someone to come and grab our order but once he did, he was super attentive and everything came out pretty fast (almost too fast considering how much food we had!! ;) )\n\nLoved the food and drinks and can't wait to check out the one in Chicago next time I'm there!"

And they haven't disappointed. Mercadito has quickly become our go to mexican restaurant spot, especially on 50% industry night :)  I will say, they got off to a rocky start between new servers, the patio construction, and some apparent reservation hiccups, but they seemed to have worked it out. So I'm a bit surprised by all the mediocre reviews. \n\nFood wise: the chicken tacos and shrimp tacos are both AMAZING. The quesadillas are delish but I would stay away from the ceviche - it's not so much a traditional ceviche as a chunky weird non-cerviche version of ceviche. But hands down, the tastiest thing to order on the menu is the bread pudding (called torrejas de bolillo). It is a must order!!!!"

The menu was pre-arranged and I'm pretty sure we got 12 of everything which was a lot of food.  Service was great, which is sometimes not the case for such a big group.\n\nThe winners of the night were:\n\nThe fish tacos. Spicy, flavorful...I would go back just for those!\nThe Mac and cheese. Chili poblano, corn and manchego cheese....so good\nThe 3-corn pico de gallo. It's more of a side than a salsa. The textures and flavors were awesome.\n\nThe margarita was too sweet. I wouldn't get it again. The dessert was also meh, but the rest of the food and the service made up for it."

My GF and I arrived a little after 5:00 on Saturday evening.\n\nService -\n\nThe hostess was prompt and our seating was immediate. Our server was pleasant and seemed knowledgeable regarding their menu and the offerings behind their theme.\n\nThroughout our meal, our server and staff were attentive and responsive. Drink order was taken promptly and cocktails were on our table in good time. Our water glasses were maintained.\n\nFood -\n\nWhile I really enjoyed the flavors of the tacos. There were some missteps for me here. One is that I believe that chips and salsa should be standard at a premium priced restaurant like this one. Charging $3.50 for a \"salsa tasting\" is a bit cheap, when you are charging $14.50 for 4 small tacos per plate. \n\nWe tried 4 plates of tacos Camaron (shrimp), Pollo (chicken), Carne Asada (steak) and Pastor (pork). They tasted great, with exception of the Carne Asada which we sent back.\n\nAlso, though ordered premium tequilas, the cocktails we a bit too steep given the  use of rocks glasses with heavy ice. 2 Don Julio Margaritas $32, 2 Fortaleza Margaritas $34... I'm sure you get the picture. \n\nAtmosphere -\n\nFor me, while the interior is visually pleasing, the interior is way too narrow and small. First of all, I have a personal grudge against establishments that use bench seating and this one uses it throughout. There are a few booths, but the entire restaurant feels cramped and claustrophobic to me.\n\nAlso, I feel that the dress code is too relaxed and doesn't reflect the pricing point. I shouldn't see flip flops and shorts abound in the interior dining room. For the patio area that's fine, but that should be regulated better.\n\nThis is maybe a Happy Hour place where you might meet for a drink at the bar and then proceed with the rest of your evening somewhere else. Overall, while the food and service were probably worth 3 stars, the headwinds of pricing and atmosphere keep it at 2 stars for me."

They could've put a couple more pieces of shrimp in there but it was really yummy so I didn't mind. \n\nWe got the salsa trio (chipotle, tomatillo, and habanero).

The stigma of upscale Mexican can be tough to overcome, but they do a good job of producing solid dishes at this new Chicago-chain import that took over the space formerly occupied by LBS at Red Rock. \n\nThe portion size of a single order of gaucamole may be small, but the Tocino ($8.50) guac packed plenty of smokiness in this non-traditional version with bacon, corn, and habanero along with a textural contrast from the crispy hominy. \n\nThe service was friendly, but the biggest drawback was having everything we ordered served at once. As soon as they brought out the guacamole they also served us our sides. Sweetness with hints of heat laced the platanos machos ($4.50) with its accompanying ginger-jalapeno sauce. The excellent depth of flavor of the elote Mexicano ($4.50) did the street food justice, but the price for one ear of corn cut in half will turn off many.\n\nOur small table was almost overflowing with plates and glassware, but still managed to cram the costillas de res ($19.50) into the mix. The build-your-own-taco entree consisted of a cast iron dish with tender, yet somewhat fatty, red wine-braised short ribs and a chipotle reduction cauliflower-turnip casserole, which were a touch bitter and undercooked for my tastes. A separate dish with tortillas, onions and cilantro was provided. It was a nice change of pace from typical Mexican fare but I'm not sure I'd order it again.\n\nThe restaurant is kid friendly and provides a separate kid's menu. An order of the kid's carne asada ($7) came with a sizeable portion of sliced beef with flavors mild enough for young, developing palates.\n\nIf you come here, prepare for a loud environment where you'll barely be able to hear the person sitting across from you. If you can deal with that and service that has no clue how to pace your meal you might enjoy the place.\n\n3.5 Stars"

We went on July 4th afternoon. we got there about 5 minutes to 4pm where we were told in a very terse voice that \"We don't open until 4pm\" - no offer of you can wait etc but being the rude NYC transplant I am, I plopped my arse down on one of their hobbit sized chairs and waited. \nOk 1st lets just say.. you are leasing space in a prime spot in a very busy casino and it's on a holiday - perhaps you should look at your market - and not stick to rules that apply to cities that are 10x the size of your local market. In NYC & Chicago maybe you can open for 6 hours a day and make your rent - but in Vegas that is a 24/7 tourist town where you are in a LOCALS casino.. perhaps you need to adjust for that. \n\nWe were finally seated at 401pm. after some discussion between the staff of who to give us to.. You'd think they'd never viewed a 6'8\" tall person and a 5'8\" fat person before. \n\nFinally we were seated and our very peppy (and nice) waitress told us they were new & they served family style like a tapas bar. that confused me. family style is usually giant bowls/platters of food shared among all parties & tapas is small plates of food which your order many to share or not. oh and 3 times with the \"we're new and just opened\" - kewl. No problem with that. we know - we've seen the hype. \n\nDrinks: \ncocktails: we ordered Bloody mary's. pretty standard for any stocked bar. Nope. not one. not even any tomato juice to fake one. reason? \"We're new\" - so we ordered one of their shots of mescal & a glass of sangria. the shot was fine - the sangria was a mix of odd flavors none of which were to be associated with any sangria i've ever experienced in the 40 years I've been imbibing. & that would be ok if it was drinkable. \nso I McGuyvered my own. I ordered a shot of vodka and an empty glass, 2 orders of their roja salsa - grabbed the lime from the sangria and wallah a Bloody mary. \n\nFood: \nCorn on the cob: delicious. \nSalsas: very good especially their salsa verde, nice full flavor with the roasted tomitilloes shining through the right amount of spice. \n2 orders of tacos in lettuce cups (nice option since they don't have 1 flour tortilla in the place) carne - tender meat and nicely spiced. pastor: dry. \nChicken enchiladas: it's been 12 days and actually I don't even remember how they tasted so it must not have made an impression. \n\nService: \nOther than the major discussion at 355-401pm over us - btw - we could hear you, ladies - our service was ok. nothing special. I guess because they were new. LOL \nThe manager came over and looked quizzically at my McGuyvered Bloody mary glass so I explained my situation. I'm pretty sure they overstaffed since they were new. and he took the sangria off my bill. \n\nTotal bill with 2 shots: 90.00 + 20% tip. \n\nNow for what you've been waiting for and why it's only 2 stars. \nthe hobbit chairs are hella uncomfortable for a person over 6' tall. yes they have bench seating but humpy so not much better. \nno bloody marys is a personal choice. \nHours of operation\nthe stage whispered discussion when we arrived 5 minutes early (and in my defense their door was open and there were people milling about.. did i know it wasn't open? no i didn't. did i know the milling people were actually staff? no i didn't. sorry we interrupted your party) \nThis is \"mexican\" food as envisioned by Victoria Beckham or maybe even Selma Hayek as touted on their website (which btw has NO hours listed) - and if that is your preference, this is a great place to be seen eating and sipping chic drinks. \nit is not a place for people who are fans of street food straight off the back streets of Mazatlan sans the expended bullets or those who think authentic mex is what you get at Taco bell."

Everyone was friendly and the servers were always coming back to check in or refill waters. It was seemingly a flawless restaurant. Unfortunately, though the restaurant had all these great qualities, the food wasn't all that impressive. I got the pastor tacos and it was alright. I then tried some of my friend's food, and that was also alright. Everything was just average. I don't know if I would come back simply because the food wasn't that appealing to me. Obviously this is my one personal opinion so others could totally think I'm wrong, but if you asked me to again, I'd probably turn the offer down and go to somewhere else in Red Rock."

            "review": "I had high expectations since the restaurant advertises that they are the best thing to come out of Mexico since Salma Hayek! That kind of flaunting piqued my interests.  This was our second attempt to eat here.  We had a failed attempt on a Friday night--the place was screaming loud and overbooked so we decided to try again later when it wouldn't be so busy.  So we went in on a Saturday afternoon, around 1pm. \n\n The place was much more mellow.  We were seated promptly and the waitress seemed friendly at first.  She instructed us to order two kind of tacos and that each order would come with 3 of them.  My fiance and I were looking for a lighter lunch so we decided to split an order of their Mahi-Mahi tacos and pair it with their traditional guacamole and then the fried plantains.  Upon us ordering this combo and sticking with our waters instead of adding on drinks (it was 1pm and 106 outside!!  Hello dehydration!) our waitress' demeanor instantly changed.  Obviously we weren't ordering enough for her to deal with us for the rest of the meal.  \n\nWhen our food came out--like 4 minutes after we ordered it--and all at once, not in stages, before I even had a chance to take a bite she was already back asking us how our meal was.  We both looked at her, dumbfounded, and replied, \"we were just about to take a bite to see!\".  She lingered for a minute and then got the hint we'd like to actually try our food before answering and then left--not remembering to look at the water glasses that were already empty.    It actually took until we had finished our meal before she noticed that we were out of water. She only noticed because we ended up scooting our glasses all the way to the front of the table so she could see they were empty.  When she finally did pour us more water, black chunks fell into my fiance's glass.  We ended up having to wait for her to come back by (another 5 minutes after we had finished eating) to tell her he needed a new glass of water since she poured something strange into his last glass.  Each glass of water was only filled 1/2 full.  For glasses that only hold about 12 oz of liquid, to fill them with 6oz is really ridiculous and just shows a waitress' lack of care about her customers.  \nService Rating:  2/10  \n\nWe tried our food and to be honest it was pretty good.  My review rating is mostly for the service instead of the food but, the food had its own issues.  \nTacos: As an avid taco eater, it is ALWAYS a disappointment to see tortillas that have not been warmed on a comal.  Our tortillas were just room temperature and not even heated at all.  Big fail for a taco place.  Who doesn't heat tortillas???  The fish tacos had a strong salt front but were balanced with the beer batter that lingered on the pallet.  The baha style sauce was faint, the tacos could have used a little more of it and maybe even more heat--spice!  The slaw was grated which was an interesting touch and provided a decent texture.  I would give these a solid 8/10.\n\nGuac:  They are not afraid to use spice!  Avocados are very chunky in the final product which is good, but the chips that were served with the dish were broken so much that we had to use a fork to put the guacamole on them.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they use frozen avocados, but I could be wrong.  The Guac gets a 7/10 because of the nice heat level and chips get a 3/10 for being over salted and broken.  \n\nPlantains:  Probably the best part of the meal.  These were cooked to perfection and the jalapeno ginger sauce was a perfect compliment. 9/10! \n\nI will be back to the restaurant to try out the Hongos tacos but will request that my tacos be heated and that our waitress keep a careful eye on our glasses throughout our meal."

My partner ordered the Turista; I ordered red wine. Turista was refreshing, snappy.  Everything else (food, service) was mediocre/poor. (Other reviewers had warned that service was bad so it was our fault for thinking that we'd get something different). We ordered three tacos. They were super small ($3 per taco, happy hour price). First, we ordered the carne taco (skirt steak, potato-fava bean hash, crispy string potatoes). There was more potato than steak. And string potatoes were stale and soggy, not crispy.  Second, we ordered the pastor taco (chile ancho rubbed pork). The pork was really fatty, very little meat. Third, we ordered the espada (swordfish), which was actually good (just small--). Finally, service was HORRIBLE. The restaurant wasn't even that crowded. To begin, the hostess seemed bummed/put out that we were even asking to be seated. Our server took our order and then went MIA. We had to flag down other servers for water and our complimentary chips and salsa. If we go back again, it will only be to grab a quick happy hour drink at the bar (will not be dealing with servers again)."

Once seated, someone gave us water but we didn't see our waitress until about 10 minutes later. Again it was busy so I understood, once we ordered the drinks they came pretty quick. I ordered the cucumber-lime agua fresca and it seriously made me feel like I was back in Mexico relaxing. Next we ordered mango guac, super fresh and yummy and came out quickly. The guac does come with a side of salsa. My date and I both ordered tacos, him pollo and I ordered carne. However his came out at least 10 minutes before mine, so that was awkward. BUT the tacos are fresh and amazing and great. I didn't feel guilty after eating them because they have this nice light feeling it might be the jicama? Being Mexican I am constantly judging and comparing tacos, but these were great. The staff was attentive while being busy. I don't understand why the reviews are so low.

I do a double heat and half smoke, I highly recommend. Next up are the tacos, there is a taco for every taste, you will certainly find at least one you like, but I but you find four or five.

This could have been a great little find...BUT: The only way this place gets a 5 star review would be if the review was only based on beer selection, simply for the fact that they serve Victoria beer, which is rare outside of Mexico. That was a GREAT surprise. However, it's not served COLD ENOUGH. It was barely chilled and then poured into a warm glass right out if the dishwasher, I presume. \n\nGuacamole appetizer is VERY small, might as well have been a side of guacamole. No flavor to speak of, and no jalape\u00f1os or seasoning to speak of. Just a mashed avocado for $9. Salsa was bland and boring as well. Nothing worse than watered down flavors, obviously catering to the American Taco Bell palette. \n\nThe tacos really earned 1 star. We were expecting authentic Mexican food, and instead we get a hipster spin on tacos. Cold tortillas with hard curled edges, weird flavors. We ordered three different tacos: carnitas, shrimp and chicken. I had one carnita taco (was it saut\u00e9ed in soy sauce?) and a bite of the shrimp. Couldn't bring myself to try the chicken tacos, they smelled odd and the meat was dry and covered in a sauce. My friend are them anyway because wasting food is a sin. Cooking like this is a bigger one! \n\nGot talked into dessert because I was still hungry after not eating the tacos and guacamole. Bread pudding churro thing...it was ok. \n\nOur service wasn't up to par either. At least be able to pronounce the items on the menu, but not being familiar with what is on your menu is a problem. \n\nOverall, the patio is great if you stick to just beer or drinks. We will be back to enjoy the patio and Victoria beer, but never ordering food here again. No bueno."

This place has been sold to the people who own the wildly-overpriced Hearthstone restaurant next door. It will have a new name and a new menu coming in 2016. http://vegas.eater.com/2015/12/8/9872852/las-vegas-restaurants-mercadito-out-at-red-rock-resort-libre-in\n\nUpdate 2015-10-01: They've been making menu changes and portioning changes. Tacos now come one at a time, minimum 2. Makes it way easier to mix-and-match so that's a welcome change. However they added pineapple to a previously-delicious guacamole that included bacon, and it completely ruined it. They also no longer have the BLTA taco, which was BY FAR the best taco I've ever had. On the up-side, they added the short rib taco to the menu permanently.\n\nThe nachos from the \"small plates\" menu, while extremely delicious, are much larger than I expected for my same $10. In fact, they are large enough that I could have easily made an entree meal out of the nachos alone (and I would have been happy to, because they are delicious). The tacos come four to a plate and are very well executed, and seem to be priced just slightly high but portioned very well.\n\nSalsas are also not free. Even then hole-in-the-wall places can afford this, I know it isn't going to break the bank. Chips and salsa is a Mexican food expectation. Period.\n\nSo we're all over the map already.\n\nThe decor seems to try to be upscale, trendy, high class, with fancy plate settings (at the expense of usability, see the guacamole plate); at the same time there are TVs on the walls showing football games both in the bar and outside of it in the main seating area and my tortilla chips came in one of those bent-metal-wire things you typically get french fries or pretzels or mozzarella sticks in wrapped up in butcher paper at some crappy sports bar.\n\nExpanding on the guacamole coming out on such a small and annoying plate, the same could be said for the entree plates. The flautas we ordered -- which are actually not flautas, they're toquitos, but they're delicious so who cares? -- are too large to fit on the plates provided except diagonally, and that makes it a pain in the ass to try to eat politely. The wife and I ended up eating them with our hands. But then...Is that what the owner intends? Is this an eat-with-your-hands kind of place? Because if so I think your waiters are overdressed, and we should talk about the ritzy place settings...\n\nAdding even more confusion to what this place is really about.\n\nOver the course of 20 minutes the music went from a 70s rock ballad to some bass-dropping dubstep to a Coldplay song that almost put me to sleep to the Gorillaz. None of this particularly related to the delicious food in strange portion sizes, or the upscale dive bar decor, or the Mexican cuisine.\n\nI'm completely perplexed by this place. Primarily, the star-loss is for price/portion/plating issues. I felt nickle-and-dimed by the guac and chips/salsa, and the way most of the food was presented was needlessly irritating."

I've had the pork, carne asada, and fish tacos (estilo baja / mahi mahi) and lemme tell you, I am usually not a fan of any fish! The fish tacos here are so delectable and decadent, you don't even know you're eating fish they come topped with chipotle aioli and Mexican slaw. The carne asada here is actually quite tasty, the steak is tender and juicy and is seasoned to perfection this has a jicama slaw and serrano roasted aioli, the pork is also yummy and has a small sweet hint to it, but still delicious this is topped with pineapple and chile de arbol salsa! They come 4 to an order, but are on the small side so it's best to order a side, or a few and do it family style!\n\nDuring this trip we also had some mac n cheese, and boy was it killer! Again it is a little small bowl, but man, its worth it! They use a chile poblano, along with  corn, and manchego cheese. DEAD. SOOO GOOD! We also had the guac with tocino, the mango, and the original. Original guac will still always be my favorite. UNLESS THEY BRING BACK THE PINEAPPLE! That one right there is TO DIE FOR!\n\nThe Misty Sleeve is one of my favorite drinks, but honestly all of their drinks are excellent. The customer service here is awesome, your glass is continually full and they are constantly checking on you!\n\nI will def be back! Especially for industry day and happy hour!\n\nYay!"

It was busy when we arrived so I was happy to see it was popular! The hostesses looked a little overwhelmed & luckily the manager or sup on duty assisted us, waited about 10 mins. \nThe seating was terrible, by far the worse part of the experience. We were sat in a section that was on top of each other & couldn't even slide our asses into the seat in between the tiny tables (I have no ass). To the left was a family of 3 somewhere from the South & possibly the loudest bunch in the entire restaurant & to the right was a mother with her daughter arguing. It felt like we were dining with all of them. Awful & annoying. Fix that terrible seating area!!!\nThe server was very friendly & everyone who delivered plates to our table were also very nice. The food is expensive & if I'm paying $4.50 for street corn I expect better seating. Our Mahi Mahi tacos lacked flavor & the traditional guacamole was bland. The chef needs to kick up the Mexican flavors my mouth was craving. Now the good stuff, my pineapple margarita was very refreshing & we enjoyed the queso with short ribs & I enjoyed all the different salsas & chips were fresh. Our dessert was almost perfect, crispy on top & very creamy but cold on the bottom :( just needed to be heated a little longer. \nThe food presentations were nice & I always appreciate a creative & clean plate. Work on some of the food & fix the bad seating area we were in & I believe this place will be amazing."

The Red Rock parking lot was packed but here we were only one of two tables, which should have been enough of a clue. Frankly, I should have just stuck with the original visit. Went in with a few coworkers and no one was impressed. \n\nFood was just lackluster. HH tacos are $3, with a few additional options for $4. They're small and for the most part, bland. The much-hyped carnitas were missing any sort of wow factor, while the swordfish contained a decent portion but no discernible seasonings. The nachos ($7, + $3.5 to add shrimp) were covered in various sauces but had no spice whatsoever, and the shrimp were small and cold. Plantains were just fine, but heads up that gluten-free folks should steer clear of the dipping sauce.\n\nService was embarrassingly slow. I don't know if our server was new (didn't seem to be) or just generally scatterbrained, but she seemed to frequently forget that she had a table. We had to ask a busser to let her know we were ready to order, then when we had a question about whether a dish contained gluten, she disappeared for 15 minutes. We actually got an answer from another employee before she came back (and still didn't have an answer). I don't mind how the dishes come out as they're ready, but when three people order several tacos that aren't separated into individual plates or orders, it gets unnecessarily complicated for both the food runners (who are clueless as to who ordered what) and the diners (who then have to touch one another's finger-food)."

Sounds gross and unsanitary. Pitiful marketing ploys aside, surprisingly, though, their menu offerings are enticing. \n\nMy friend and I came here for brunch, which was $20.15 for three courses. In addition, we ordered a side of ceviche. \n\nAppetizer - Camar\u00f3n Ceviche: Delicious. This has a nice, fresh and clean taste. My one criticism is that I wanted to taste more of the lemon flavor. \n\nFirst Course - Appetizer - Mango Guacamole:  Loved this. The guacamole had a nice kick. Too bad there wasn't a little more mango to balance the fatty flavor of avocado. \n\nSecond Course - Entree - Carnitas Hash: By the time this arrived, I was nearly stuffed. But damn, this was GOOD! Braised pork, crispy potatoes, and a sunny side egg to top it off. I could have this for breakfast every week. \n\nThird Course - Pastel de Chocolate: To me, this was just an ordinary chocolate cake. I should've ordered the Torrejas de Bolillo instead because it tasted like a churro. \n\nService - Good, though, we had an awkward moment when we were served our desserts immediately after having received our appetizers. *womp womp*\n\nOverall - I would return if I was craving \"sexy\" Mexican food."

We decided to go with the $20 value pp which included:\n2-guacamoles (to share)\n2-salsas (unlimited)\n2-sides (to share)\n3- different types of tacos (each person gets three of the same kind)\nFor an additional $3pp you get one dessert each. Beware of the menu it's a bit confusing; there's a lot going on. Overall the food is always good, not amazing, but good. The dessert menu is horrible!!! Only three options and what's supposed to be there best, soaked bread topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, isn't even that good. Their \"second best,\" chocolate cake, is horrendous! I don't even want to try the coconut flan. But as far as the tacos go, I've tried almost all of them and the best would have to be the Pancita. I feel like the menu and food need improvement. For \"high end\" Mexican food and what they charge you'd expect a lot more. We come here because our kids love playing in the arcade and Mercadito is one of the better options inside RR. On a brighter note, the staff is great and very friendly!"

            "review": "I only tried out alcoholic drinks and the chips and salsa the first time I went to Mercadito. There were only 5 beers on draft - I tried the Tailwagger wheat ($6), which was a-okay (but I'm no beer connoisseur). Next, I tried the Paloma Picosa ($11). The server noticed I wasn't really drinking it, and offered to take it off the tab and find me a drink I liked better. I went with his recommendation and got the Auntie Ox ($10). Ugh. The drink looked exactly the same and I didn't really like it either. Too strong and the rim was doused in whatever that Mexican Candy is called that looks like cayenne pepper. I gave up. \n\nMy husband tried the cabernet sauvignon ($9), chardonnay ($10), and sauvignon blanc ($9.50). He didn't like ANY of them, but proceeded to drink the wine anyways lol. His statement was, \"They all taste like shit and are low quality wines\". Service was 5/5 but drinks were 2/5. Regardless, it was Industry Night and we got a whopping 50% off the bill. Yes, please. \n\nThe second time my husband and I went was before the Dirty Derby event, which happened to land on a Tuesday, Industry Night. We were disheartened to learn the discount had dropped to 30%, but hey, that's still a pretty large discount. The prices at Mercadito are steep compared to most Mexican restaurants, so you'll want to take that into consideration as well. \n\nCHIPS AND SALSA ($3.50): The tray the salsa comes in is awkward, especially because they put mini spoons in it that just gets in the way. Salsas were pretty good, as were the chips. 3.5/5\n\nCHEESE ENCHILADAS ($18): I ordered them with the guatillo red sauce. I liked the extra kick of the sauce and appreciated that it looked homemade. The entree came with a side of black beans and rice. The black beans tasted hideous, and the rice was completely bland with random chucks of avocado and carrots in it. 3/5\n\nNACHOS ($11.50): My husband ordered these with steak, which costs an extra $3. He said they were just okay and he wasn't impressed at all. He said the meat tasted like it was low quality. He threw up later that night, so there's that too. But I don't know the inner workings of food poisoning, so who am I to say his violent vomiting could be attributed to Mercadito's??  2/5   \n\nSERVICE: I thought our server was above average. She was nice and refilled our chips without us having to ask. She delivered the check quickly too. 4/5\n\nATMOSPHERE: I love the ambiance here. I like the bar area better though because it's more open and I like that it opens up to an outdoor patio. 4/5\n\nTLDR; Great service, not cheap, mediocre food, blah drinks, Industry Tuesdays for 30% off your bill. \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nMy husband says nay but I still want to give this place one more chance. I'd like to come by for Happy Hour and try their vegetarian tacos.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #66"

When I came in last week - had a normal course of chit chat with the hostess \"how's your day?\", she replied \"it sucks, I can't wait until it's over\" (something like that). As a hostess, you're the face of the business... and even if your day sucks super bad, the customer shouldn't really know that. \n\nOnce my friend came, we sat down to order. I ordered the vegan fish tacos (which are substituted with zucchini, although last time it was squash). My friend was going to order the burger, but then they told her it would take 20+ minutes and basically we wouldn't get our food at the same time. She then ordered the lobster tacos (4 of them, since our waitress said you could only order 4 minimum on lobster). About 15 minutes later, the waitress came back to tell my friend, \"oh yea, you can order less than 4 if you want... how many did you want?\" So we had to wait even longer since her order I guess was never placed for the 4? \n\nIn addition to this our waitress \"forgot\" it was Thursday, and that there were specials. Plus she forgot the \"chicas night\" until we ask her.\n\nOh, and the \"manager\" came by to check on our meal, his hands were in his pockets the entire time? Awkward and weird :/\n\nFood is decent, but service is lackluster."

My husband left a good tip because he was do pleased with the constant attention. We'll be coming back over and over again."

Also, they had a DJ playing loud annoying club music and I'm sorry, but that is definitely not what I want to hear on a Sunday afternoon at a Mexican restaurant in a casino off the strip. \n\nWe ordered chips, salsa, and traditional guacamole and everything was just so bland and lacking in flavor. The mushroom, shrimp, and fish tacos were just okay. I've definitely had much better elsewhere. \n\nThe only reason this place gets two stars is because the margaritas were good. Unfortunately not enough to get us to return."

Hostess seated us right away, our water glasses were ALWAYS full, and our waitress visited us a few times to make sure everything was going ok.\nThe reason for the low rating was the food. First of all charging over $3 for salsa \"tasters\" is ridiculous. When I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect to get chips and salsa. Just like I expect to get bread and olive oil at an Italian place. So we ordered the guacamole and some salsa. Portion was good but the taste was average. \nI ordered the swordfish tacos. All in all they were very good. You get 4 tacos in a serving and it came with a piece of fish and slaw. The slaw was a cabbage and jalepineo mix which was VERY good.\nMy wife ordered the chicken enchilada. So so... Chicken was ok but the smothered it with a creamy sort of dressing that ruined the dish.\nProbably won't go back."

We noticed that just now after being short changed and when we brought it up to the bartender she made it seem like it's a totally normal thing to do and was actually very unprofessional about it. She made US feel like idiots and like we are cheap for asking. \"Oh I can give you your small change if you Really want it\" \n\"Oh really?! You will?!

You do this do 5,000 people in a week or month, short change them by .40-.50 cents and you've made an extra 2.5 grand. I'm not okay with that at all. The principal and ethics are in question.

(3) Value: pricey for what it is, we might hit it again but not at full menu prices (3).\n\nWe dropped by after work to take in their Taco Tuesday promotion. This is 2 of their street sized tacos for $5.50 after 9 pm. Bar only.\n\nSo we check in with the hostess and she gestures that we could seat ourselves in the bar area. We score an elevated bar table for the two of us and we wait to get service.\n\nThen we see the hostess/server milling around us, looking at us funny. Finally the hostess approaches us and asks us to move from our spot.\n\n\"Isn't it first come first serve?\"\n\"Yeah, well normally it is but another couple has been waiting for this spot to be vacated and cleaned. They were sitting at the bar.\"\n\nShe apologized and moved us to a table in the dining room, assuring us that Taco Tuesday still applied for us. As soon as our server came, he told us that it didn't apply to the dining room however he would have to check with his supervisor to see if it was okay. In the end,he couldn't find his supervisor but gave us the discount anyway which was cool.\n\nWe appreciated our server's brisk and energetic service. Never were our water glasses empty and the food came out prompty except for our last set of tacos.\n\nSo we tried 5 different types of street tacos: their mahi mahi fish tacos, carne tacos, al pastor, wild mushroom and their pancitas tacos.\n\nIf there is key criticism of the tacos we ate, it's the overall muddled flavors in all of the food. I would say that most of the tacos had just too many different competing flavors going on to truly make an exceptional dish. \n\nOverall, we liked their al pastor the least. Their rendition of the al pastor was overly sauced and it lacked that meat roasted on a stick smokiness that makes al pastor so good. \n\nThe carne tacos were solid - like the watercress jicama combination on top. My only issues were the watercress jicama overwhelmed the carne a bit too much. The mahi mahi was good but the fried mahi mahi's crispy coating went soft too quickly and could use extra time in the fryer. The pancita tacos were okay - digged the interesting texture of the chicharron but didn't like the overly fatty pieces of pork belly. The hongos, I thought, was the best dish of the night with the umami hit of mushroom matching well the the tomato sofrito.\n\nIn general, the food is largely okay and quite pricey considering the level of cuisine here. I am undecided on whether to return here - if I do, there would need to be a discount involved. 3-starred review."

When a menu item sounds as appetizing as it tastes, I'm usually drawn to it and as such never venture away. This is the case with Mercadito. Their tacos are very unique in the fact that they have elaborate ingredients on each dish. Example: Camaron - shrimp, roasted garlic, avocado , chipotle mojo. Carne asada-epazote & oregano marinated skirt steak, watercress jicama slaw, Serrano roasted garlic aioli, crispy shallots. Overall, I am a big fan of their food and their drinks. Service seems to go in either direction as I've had exceptional service(at the bar) and poor service ( dining room).  This is a very good local spot to wind down from the daily grind and prices are very affordable ($4 per taco-$11 for craft cocktail). I enjoy the ambience and the crowd is generally very friendly.

But if I only go for the appetizers next time, I wouldn't be surprised.  We of course ordered the chips and salsa sampler, a trio of mostly good salsas and house made corn chips. They were on the thick side and a little greasy but they got the job done. The guacamole was a little simple, but they brought the flavor out nicely.  \n\nWe ordered the nachos, which at $7 isn't a bad deal, but that was the happy hour price. The portion was a little small and light on toppings for anything more than that. I appreciate the approach mercadito takes with their nachos. I'm a bit of a nacho enthusiast, so I'm always open to something different. These offer nothing particularly special, just black beans, cheese, crema, tomatoes and diced avocado. You can order meat, but in keeping with the simple theme, I chose to leave it off. I enjoyed the pairing of traditional ingredients, which offered a somewhat refreshing take on the bar food favorite.\n\nMy wife loved the elote, roasted corn cob dusted with chile and cotija cheese.  Again, much pricier than the man who sells it from a cart on the street, but just as delicious.\n\nProbably the biggest deal at happy hour was the cold draft beer. I got a pint of Ballast Point Sculpin IPA for $4. Haven't found a price like that anywhere.\n\nMercadito offers flavorful Mexican food, great drinks, and a modern atmosphere. If I'm ever at Red Rock with friends, I'd definitely suggest this place for a few drinks and a bite to eat."
