            "review": "Had the pleasure of eating at Musashi for dinner last night. Why you should listen to me: I consider myself a Japanese steak house fanatic. \n\nThis place is rude, crude with great food. Ask for the Adult show and if there are no kids nearby you might be able to get it!\n\nI order the Shogan special(Filet and chicken) and my wife order the NY Steak and chicken. Everything was cook perfectly to how we ordered it. I have to comment that the flavors and spin on the traditional courses of a Japanese steak house from the salad to the soup were quite unique. \n\nThe reason I gave this place four stars. The soup is extremely spicy with loads of pepper. Not sure how you mess up meso soup. Extremely pricey. There are a lot of choices in Vegas, money can make or break you.\n\nOverall, great to experience what many famous people have in the past."

Beautifully decorated interior, delicious tender chicken teriyaki paired with a perfectly crisp vegetable tempura and traditional green tea.

            "review": "the good:\n-the food is AMAZING (try the steak... and im not even a meat-eater. it comes with shrimp, which were somehow, amazingly, crafted into little bunnies, veggies and fried rice, plus tons of delicious sauces)\n-the sushi rolls (try the spicy california or the classic avo-cuc); its just inflated here by 2.5x\n-the drinks (try any of their sake-tinis like the apple or pomegranate. they are light, fruity and you cant taste the alcohol... so be careful not to down it like a 5-year-old with a juicebox) \n-the teppan chef was SO entertaining; you could tell he really enjoys it and everyone at our table had a blast. he jokes with you, makes shapes, tells stories with the food and even does the oldie-but-goody onion volcano (ask for TIGER WOO; hes got props!)\n-the bathroom; so clean, so nice\n\nthe bad:\n-the wait; we waited an hour before the chef even came out, even though we had reservations and the other half of the teppanyaki bar came in after us but they got served first \n-the smell; when you walk into this place, it smells like a stink-bomb went off\n-off the strip so take a cab \n-the bill! that stuff adds up quickly so plan to spend at least $50/person. and consequently... \n-the 18% mandatory gratuity (i know we had a party of 8 but it never stated anywhere that they were including the tip and the chef walked off with $40 cash plus 18% from each of us... the 8 of us split into 4 bills)"

This is probably my 5th time here, as I come here once a year for the shotshow convention.  \n\nThe food was excellent, as there are many freshly prepared sauces to try on your meat and veggies.  Jason was our skilfull Teppan-yaki chef for the evening and did a great job in making people laugh.  \n\nMy chicken and NY steak were delicious, along with the fresh sushi rolls for dinner.  Thank you for another great dining experience.  Oishikata!"

            "review": "My husband and I were recently in Las Vegas on vacation.  We've been to Vegas about a dozen times, and we wanted our last dinner in Vegas to be Tepanyaki.  There are certainly a lot of options for this in Vegas, but we decided to trust our fellow Yelpers and check this place out.  \n\nWhen we first arrived just before 6 on a Sunday our host asked if we had reservations.  We were a bit surprised since there was only one other party in the restaurant.  We were seated right away, and the other family at the table spoke so highly of the food we were about to eat that we really began to be excited.  \n\nThe food was absolutely incredible.  I'm not sure if this is true everywhere, but certainly where we are from in NH you find that a lot of the flavor and seasoning is from soy sauce when you have Tepanyaki.  Unfortunately a lot of Tepanyaki in NH tastes the same.  But man was I impressed by this place!  I've never seen food seasoned and flavored the way it was here.  Flavors were layered and built in such a way that each thing I tasted was better than the last thing.  I had the Shrimp and Scallops and my husband had the Steak and Chicken.  Everything was fresh and the flavors were so balanced.  Often times I get sauces on the side for Tepanayki and I need those to provide depth of flavors.  This is the first time that I've had Tepanyaki that I didn't need those side carts of sauces.  I was so full when I left, but I didn't feel gross because of an abundance of grease.  \n\nPerhaps the only feedback we could pass along to the owners are with respect to the bathrooms.  I did not use their facilities but my husband did.  While it was clear they do a nightly cleaning, some things just need a little bit of sprucing.  For example, there was a wall-mounted air freshener that clearly hadn't been replaced in a few weeks or month.  But that's such a minor detail in the grand scheme of our evening that I almost hate to bring that up.  It certainly didn't detract from the experience that we had though as you can see based on how highly I rated it.  We will definitely be making this a regular part of our trips to Vegas going forward."

            "review": "I wish I can split up the review into 2 parts: the food, and the service.\n\nThe food:  Amazing.  Best teppanyaki place I've ever been to, in terms of food.  I got fried rice, lobster tail, and filet mignon.  Even the vegetables were excellent. \n\nThe service: Subpar.  I made reservations for 8, and we still waited about an hour from the moment we entered the restaurant until the chef showed up.  When you walk in, the smell is pretty bad, like rotting fish or something.  The staff was very polite though.  However, we had a chef who could not stop making pretty vulgar sexual innuendos to the ladies in our group, making them very uncomfortable.  It was highly unprofessional, and it didn't stop even after he was done cooking."

            "review": "As my wonderful boyfriend said below (although I won't be as nice as he was), this place basically sucked. I originally read the reviews for this place (which is why my boyfriend and I went there... sorry babe) and being that it was one of the highest rated sushi restaurants in Vegas on here, that's what we decided on. Now it seems like a lot of people have rated it highly based on the teppenyaki side but as far as sushi goes, it was simply the worst sushi either of us has ever had. The mussels in which I've never had a truly bad experience with, were falling apart and mushy. I don't know how to even describe the rolls! They were just weird and and the fish was sooooo NOT fresh! I've read peoples reviews saying how fresh it was and I dunno if they came on a good day or maybe they've just never had good sushi before but this stuff was just terrible! Also on the website it actually talks about their unique and modern interior decoration... HELLO!! There we holes in the seats of the booths and the lighting was a bright florescent light hanging right above your head literally blinding you! The place was just downright dull and dreary. \nLook, I have never left a review for anywhere before because I've never felt the need to and I've had plenty of bad experiences in different restaurants before, but I absolutely LOVE sushi and this place was just horrible in every way. PLEASE don't bother wasting your time in going there if sushi is what you want. I can't say anything about the teppanyaki side but oh lord... bad sushi. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."

The service was quick, out chef was amazingly funny, as there were 3 ppl with birthdays at my table. If you don't have a sense of humor with the jokes this place is not for u as it can be a little\nRated R. The food was delicious and portions wee a good size, i had the chicken, fried rice and gyoza while my friend had the steak and prawns.

It didn't blow my socks off and I probably won't come back. I would rather go to benihanas if I am paying a high price tag anyway. The table seemed a little dirty, not many people were there, the waitress was stressed out and not particularly friendly.  I've had better, this place was meh."

As long as you are sitting at a table with only adults, you can ask for the 'special' showing with Tiger. Tiger is not only a spectacular chef who should be promoted as the Entertainer of the year but the food is excellent! Check this place out when you are in Vegas and be sure to ask for Tiger and make an advance reservation."

I wanted someplace reasonably priced with convenient seating for the nine people in my party who could do saki bombs without being looked at like we are weird and oh yeah, good food.  Check, check, check and check!!\n\nFirst let me tell you about the food.  No other teppan style restaurant compares.  Musashi is so delicious.  A lot of times, teppan for me is tasteless because all it is is just unseasened food being grilled, not much flavor or style, but evertying Tiger made for us was mouthwatering.  And if you are a sauce person, he makes about a half dozen for you to try and advises you which sauce to eat with what type of food.  And the portions are so generous that two people can definately share one plate so go ahead and order the lobster and rib eye (even though we ordered that AND the sea bass and chicken...both so yum).  Do get the fried rice as it is really delicious.\n\nAnd now for the entertainment.  All nine of us agreed that we had the best time.  All nine of us agreed that we are coming back next time we are back in Vegas.  All nine of us were in stiched laughing we had such a good time.\n\nDon't hesitate on holding your event here!  And request Tiger to perpare your food.  He has some skilz fo sho!!!"

Everything he made for us was yummy and the show itself was amazing.  My one year old was all smiles while watching Chef Tsutomu's performance.\n\nBesides his food and show being excellent, service was great too.  His staff was very attentive and catering especially with the baby with us.  The price is a bit steep but it is worth every penny.   We definetly  will come back again."

            "review": "Mushashi is your typical teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant. When you first walk in, underwhelmed is probably the word that comes to mind. The paint is chipping/dirty, the furnishings have seen their better days, and any decorations that they did have were modest at best. They do have some really cool kimonos on the walls though. Probably to cover a hole in the wall or gang graffiti or something.\n\nThe bathroom is a complete disaster. The door didn't lock and the upkeep was... Basically there is no upkeep. I've seen frat houses have cleaner bathrooms. It was pretty gross.\n\nSo after all that, I STILL gave this place four stars. Why? The food is that good and the price they charge at happy hour is ridiculously cheap. The food is comparable, if not better, than the much more expensive teppenyaki locations. Literally the cost is about 1/3 or 1/4 what you would spend at Benihanas. The chefs are all very friendly and they put on a fun/funny show, but thats nothing new to this type of setting. \n\nI do not recommend the sushi here. Stick with the teppenyaki. The uni that I ordered looked and tasted like it was scraped off the bathroom floor. \n\nOverall, great food and great price. I actually made myself hungry thinking about this place and will most likely go tonight!"

But a friend that regularly has business in Vegas wanted to take me there and I'm always down for hibachi.\n\nWalking in, when I'm used to visiting the typical tourist places on the strip and in the casinos, I was definitely thinking this would either be a great experience or a reason to stick to the easy stuff on the strip.\n\nWhile we waited, we went ahead and had a sushi roll. I don't remember which one, but it was great.\n\nIt turned out to be really good all around. The chef was very entertaining and the food was great. I kept it simple and just went with the chicken, and it was delicious.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back. It ended up being nice to get off the strip a bit (even though this is still just like a block or something from the strip) and go to a non casino restaurant."

This reflected on my personal favorite dish: The Ahi Poke salad.\n\nFour of us ordered the poke and found it to be extremely peppery and spicy hot.  Yes, Poke should have a kick, but none of us were able to enjoy it.  We commented to the chef and waiter the extreme spiciness, and even said every time we go to Vegas (which is multiple times a year) we always stop at Musashi and order the Poke salad.\n\nThe chef actually gave me a negative feedback by saying that is how HE does it, and didn't apologize.  I was upset at how he dismissed my complaint. He didn't bother to re-do my dish, and I know he could hear my table's entire conversation at our displeasure (we were sitting next to the Sushi bar!).  \n\nI know the chef changed because even the presentation of the salad was different.  I will go back to Musashi, but next time I order the Ahi Poke salad, I will specify to not be so peppery, and not be so \"red hot\" spicy. \n\nI still am fuming over the last visit, and hope that Musashi will address this review."

I fell in love.\n\nThis time around I took my family who's never had a teppanyaki style dinner before. I made reservations for 8pm last night, and we got there 30 minutes early. We were really happy that they were able to sit is right  away and we didn't have to wait another 30min.\n\nThe service was great. But the chef we got was disappointing. First, he talked really low and I couldn't hear the jokes that were part of the act. Ok.. That's not such a big problem. But as he was going through the whole thing I noticed he skipped a lot of tricks or special maneuvers. Mind you, I'm an avid eater at teppanyaki places and the acts everywhere are pretty much the same. So to see that he skipped the beating heart part, broke my heart. He also skipped a number of things too, that I was looking forward for my family to witness. Again, they've never had this type of dinner/show before let alone been to Vegas.\n\nMaybe the act isn't mandatory or the chefs don't have to have jokes and special gestures? I don't know. I just felt kind of let down. \n\nOther than that, the food was amazing."

Well, I was there for a dance competition and the night we got to Vegas me and my family was starving! Oh handy Yelp to the rescue! There was no way we were going to eat at a chain restaurant so I looked up a local place. I picked Musashi and really hoped it was going to be good.\n\nOh and it was! Their shrimp is to dieeee for. No joke. What is it they cook it with, honey mustard? Whatever it is, it is TASTY. I had Filet Mignon, my brother had NY steak w/ Scallops, mama had the same but with prawns, and pops had it with a salmon fillet. I tried a piece of their food and they were all good. Oh and DO choose the fried rice over steamed! Their fried rice was so yummy.\n\nConclusion? This place beats Benihana any day. I personally don't even like Benihana and this place just hits the teppanyaki spot. I've been exposed to pretty good Teppanyaki spots back in Guam, and it's good to know that there's one in the mainland that is just as good. Plus the service was great! Maybe we were lucky, but my parents never had an empty cup of hot tea. Now our check was huge (like YUUUUUGE), but it was worth it.\n\nDid I mention our chef was cute and entertaining?"

The chef Tiger is the best one, and also his cousion is very good too. The chefs put on a show as you eat and it is entertaining. \nThe only thing that could be better is -it is a little pricey, and sometimes you get a newer chef that isnt as good as Tiger. It usually takes 30min to an hour to eat here, they pace the meal and cook each thing by itself usually. It is very filling, I recommend the Geisha special which I usually order. And try to get Tiger as your chef, he makes the whole experience better. He also cares a lot about his customers and it shows. -Jerry"

Then, when I explained that I doubted her entire party of 40 would be there by 7pm, let alone have their whole drink order taken and served, she just said she couldn't seat us.

All of them were good, including the hot sauce. And Call me cheesey but I liked the show. Our chef was funny and entertaining. Kept us laughing the whole time. The birthday girl really enjoyed herself...It was a bit pricey n weird that rice was a separate charge.

Don't get me wrong, all of the guys are great, but he makes delicious sauces and his personality is fun. Not only do they serve teppanyaki here, they also have sushi and a kitchen menu. \n\nPros:\n-Half price after 12am (last call is 3:30am)\n-Make their own sauces (sweet mayo is the best)\n-Friendly staff\n\n\nTips:\n-Make a reservation if you're going on a weekend or around 7pm...they get really busy! You can even request which chef you would like.\n\n-Try the sweet mayo! It's the sauce they put on the shrimp, but I put it on everything. It's amazing!\n\n-Even if you only kind of like fried rice, get it!!! This is the most delicious fried rice ever.

However, our orders were taken by group so it was divided up pretty reasonably. We were at a table of six.\n\nWe order donburi almost all the way around, except we had one Japanese pizza order, which sounded interesting. I received my chirashi probably 20-30 minutes at least if not longer, before anything else came out of the kitchen (my wife sent it back to be chilled since it was out so long). Next came the tempura and some of the other food including some fried rice. The Japanese pizza was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe food was adequate. And I should have known better, but the sushi was not great.  The tempura was no worse then anything I've had before, but the selection of tempura was lame - a mix of broccoli and shrimp with maybe a potato (?) or something. No carrot, no beans, nothing else in the vegetable department. The shrimp tempura, however, was slightly mushy. \n\nAfter nearly an hour the Japanese pizza came out and was immediately returned because the dough was not cooked. At all. When queried they said the delay was caused by the time it takes to cook the dough. Clearly that was not the case. It is frustrating to be told the order was put in at the same time as the rest of the orders, yet when you finally receive the dish it clearly hasn't been cooked properly and clearly was rushed to the table. It was replaced with some tempura which was fine.\n\nThe worst part, and the part that hurts the review, was after the meal we all felt sick to our stomachs, rendering us useless for almost two hours.\n\nSuffice to say, we won't be returning and I have warned off the rest of my friends."

I don't live in Vegas but whenever I visit I try to make reservations here and I do recommend making reservations because this place can be quite hard to get into otherwise since they only have so many seats at the teppan tables. \n\nYou can pretty much order anything off the menu and you will be pleased but my faves are the filet mignon and shrimp. The chefs here are AMAZING and very entertaining as well!!\n\nMusashi is located just off the strip and took us about 8 minutes to get to from Caesar's Palace.\n\nAs we were paying our bill last time Floyd Mayweather and his HUGE entourage were being sat at the table next to us. This place has pics of celebrities all over the wall and its no surprise why. Rated as one of the best steakhouses in America and it holds up to all the hype!"

            "review": "this is a lengthy review for 2 reasons: 1. this was my first time here. 2. NO ONE HAS REVIEWED THIS PLACE ON YELP YET!!\n\ni LOVED my experience here. my boyfriend and i JUST got back from our 4 day trip to vegas, and the first thing i wanted to do was share w/ all the yelpers how AMAZING this place is.  \n\nit's off the strip, in the same plaza as Firefly, so i'm sure many of you are familiar w/ the location.\n\nSERVICE:i made a reservation for 15 people at 10pm on a saturday night, this past new years weekend.  it was not crowded at all.  we were seated right away. the prices on the menu looked a bit steep depending on what you order (about $20-60 for teppanyaki), but let me tell you, these people really know thier shit when it comes to seasoning, adding flavor, and cooking meat.  we really had a very memorable dinner here, thanks to TIGER and YOUNG (and no they are not strippers. they were our teppanyaki chefs).  TIger was obviously the veteran of the two, making vulgar jokes, and toying with us diners.  I'm guessing Young was new, but oh so very cute.  If you do end up eating teppanyaki, ask the chefs if you can wear their hat, (they'll say no, but believe me. they'll make you wear their \"special\" apron instead. trust. i fell for it).  overall, the staff was very attentive and friendly to us.  \n\nDRINKS: i had the lychee saketini and the lotus blossom. both very good, light, delivered fast, and also left me a little tipsy but not too drunk or belligerent to get bloated from dinner.  \n\nFOOD: keep in mind all teppanyaki dinners include salad, soup, rice, veggies, and a shrimp appetizer.  i ordered the Seabass (about $23) and my boyfriend had the geisha special (steak and chicken, about $25).  our proteins were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and they also made the most delicious sauces to go w/ everything, including this delightful garlic thing that i drenched my fried rice in, even though the rice already didn't need much.  \n\nwe also ordered 2 sushi rolls. we had 'da bomb' (jalapeno, cream cheese and spicy tuna) which was really good if you like SPICINESS and the 'j in your mouth' roll (pretty much a tempura battered philly roll) which was also VERY VERY DELICIOUS.  \n\nAMBIANCE: i liked it. simple, not overpretentious. you could come in jeans or decked out in your sequined hootchiemama dresses.  \n\nKEEP IN MIND: \nall that matters is that you don't need  to be a high roller here to get excellent service. they made my entire group feel like big ballers for one night.  we were also celebrating 2 birthdays, and my friends each got their own tempura ice cream.  the one thing i will do though, is make reservations for a later time. check the hours on the website.  i do know that they have a daily happy hour from 11pm-4am in which the prices for a lot of the menu items drops down very generously.  seriously, take advantage of this place. it really will bring you good times w/ good people.  and remember, always chat it up w/ your chefs.  they will defintely make sure that your money does not go to waste."

            "review": "Welcome to the finest Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, possibly the entire country. We have visited this place several times over the past couple years. We are Vegas regulars and go out of our way to visit every time we are in town. \n\nThere are two things that are absolutely outstanding at this restaurant and will blow your mind. First is the service, second is the food. \n\nThe reason we started visiting here was a result of the owner/chef Tsutomu and his previous job. Prior to opening his own restaurant, he worked at the teppan grill in Hamada in the Flamingo. His personality, friendliness and cooking abilities were so impressive that we had to follow him to his new business. After just one visit, he remembered our names. \n\nThe Chef constantly engages his customers, determines their level of comfort and works to reach it. There's really not words to describe how nice and accommodating he is to all his customers. It's obvious they get a lot of regulars as a result of this. It's also nice to see that the owner isn't just sitting the back doing nothing, he cooks on the grill more than anyone else and his wife works the hostess stand sometimes. One time, on our way out, she noticed we were calling a cab, and called it for us, telling them to step on it. All his staff are very polite and well trained. This is one of those rare places, outside my own home, where I always feel truly comfortable and welcome. When they aren't too busy in there, and cooking has finished, the owner will stay to chat for a while at the grill. If you want a remarkable experience for service, come here. I suggest you specifically request (even if you have to wait) for the owner to cook for you, instead of another staff member. It's worth the wait. \n\nCombine that kind of service, with the food, and you get a winning combination. All the food is excellent, beyond excellent. We cook a lot at home, and know good seasonings, versus salting everything. This guy truly has a talent. Everything from the salads, sushi and grill are recognizable dishes (especially if you've ever been to Benihana's) but with unique twists that give it really special flavors and bring out the ingredients' natural qualities. Even the salad, instead of the typical asian dressing, comes out with (what I think is) an apple flavored dressing. Every sauce in the entire restaurant is hand crafted from his original recipes. The salad and soup are great, but wait until you taste something off that grill. Just when you think he couldn't possibly do any more with the sauces, he adds about 10 more things and it smells even better. We've had the pleasure of him 'testing' his newer sauces on us a few times. Let me be very clear: best ever. We are talking about a culinary genius here. The owner has an honest passion for what he does. I've had steak, shrimp, scallops and even simple teriyaki chicken here, and each was better than the one before. The fried rice is a special treat too. I typically prefer white rice, but always look forward to the fried rice here. \n\nThey have several sake and beer selections here. They get a lot of locals in there after midnight, and they are typically open after 2 or 3am. They enjoy a rowdy crowd in there, but we also took our grandmother and her friends in. The decor is quite nice, not over the top, but not cheesy, like most of these establishments. A cab ride, with tip, from a strip hotel will run you less than $20. \n\nI cannot recommend this place enough. It's a masterpiece in every way. The prices are moderate. I usually end up spending less than I thought I would, even though they seem high when I look at them. What more can you say about a restaurant with excellent service and the best food this side of the Pacific? Please give this place a try, it will blow you away."

I am telling you people don't waste your money or time I don't care if Brad Pitt, or Obama ate here.

I used to frequent Hamada when it was on Flamingo (back when it was good), and have eaten at many teppanyaki places, Osaka, Geisha Steakhouse, Ohjah, etc, etc. This by far was my favorite experience.\n\nThey have quite an extensive menu, featuring anything from Kobe Beef to NY Strip Steak, Lobster, Scallops, Prawns, Chicken, Salmon and more. Probably more selection than other places. Prices are a little bit higher, but the quality makes it worthwhile. I opted for the Samurai 3 dinner, NY Strip and Salmon, for $33 (add $3.50 for fried rice). So not too bad.\n\nChef Yung (probably misspelled) was excellent. He does all the tricks with the knife and spatula, onion volcano, etc. He really stood out because he can cook!!! He took some special sauce orders and whipped them up. My salmon could have been prepared 3 different ways, I chose lemon dill and it was great! The conversation at the table also focused on Yelper's favorite subject.....other restaurants!! Tiger the owner has a couple new ones coming up. He also gave us a few to try out which of course I can't remember (thanks Sake and Sapporo). \n\nOverall, just a very pleasant dining experience, with good high quality food. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to highly recommend to anyone seeking good Teppanyaki."

But once you're seated, you're away from that area and all seems fine. \n\nService is always great and they're real friendly. It's a but pricey, for two people, you can spend about $70-$90 for food and non-alcoholic drinks. My husband usually does the Teppanyaki and I order sushi. \n\nFrom what I've heard, Musashi is known for their sauces, for Teppanyaki. Those sauces are GREAT. There was a lemon garlic sauce that they made and it was AWESOME. I love garlic. Sushi isn't bad. I always order the spicy scallop roll. \n\nOn occasion, you can see a local celebrity, someone that performs on the strip... i.e. that magician, can't remember his name though...

The three of us waited about an hour before paying our drinks bill and leaving, after repeatedly being told that our chef (and food) were \"almost there.\"\n\nUnfortunately, everyone else at our station (maybe an additional half dozen people) was also kept waiting, and I suspect they left soon after.

They have a full fare menu from steaks to izakaya.   We ordered numerous dishes and almost everything was delicious.  This comes at a price of 30-50 a person keep in mind so it better be tasty.\n\nThe third time we went we brought some family and the service was really bad - which is really crazy since the waitress even knew someone in our party.  It is a massive pet peeve of mine when service is poor and the restaurant is straight up empty.  This put a damper on the night, since a dish or two had to go back and it got painful.  *sigh*.

I had the Musashi Special which comes w/ the filet, prawns, scallops, and lobster tail. Mmm... drooling now... Husband had the Yoshida Special which is the rib-eye and lobster tail. I wanted to try their sushi too, but that's a lot of food already. Everything was yummy, the chef was cool, and the others at the table were cool too. The fried rice and the veggies are always a good way to start the meal. Oh, and they bring you a salad before the chef starts. For dessert, I had the red bean ice cream and my husband had the green tea. I should have gone with my usual, but I wanted to try something different. Green tea ice cream was better.

They were out of most of the sushi apps we wanted-no baby yellowtail, uni, grilled octopus salad to name a few. Given it was tSunday of Memorial Day weekend we tried to be understanding- must have been a busy weekend. We had to inquire about happy hour, as they made no mention nor introduced anything of the menu/specials. Waiter finally brought us happy hour menus. Since they were out of so many apps, decided to do tepanaki. Son wanted to do the shabu shabu but that option inot avail at tepanaki bar. Too bad they hadn't reviewed the options prior to seating. Our chef (bro of owner) was friendly, talented and probabaly the best part of the meal. We're doing the \"low carb\" thing, all ordered extra veggies in lieu of rice.  Food good, but a somewhat nice experience turned sour when we got the bill.  There were no less than 6+ \"Open Food\" items listed on the bill (ie no explanation of charge), plus we had been charged for several sushi items they were out of!  We'd had several sakitinis and belive they rely on tipsy guests not checking their bill. I reviewed the bill with the gentleman at register, he wanted no part of it and called waitress over.  She proceeded to immediately delete the sushi items.  When I inq about the \"Open Food\" I was informed that a total of $34 had been charged for \"extra veggies\"! When I said that no mention of an added charge for veggies in lieu of rice was made she started to argue talking through the gentleman at the register - she did not want to deal with me directly. I piped in that I refused to pay $34 for a few extra onions/mushrooms and zucchini-the gentleman at register advised her to remove it ,she did reluctantly with no apology - just walked away.  All told our $346 bill came down to $264...imagine if we'd let our tipsy, vacation mood overlook checking the bill. Shady,dishonest, rude and WE WON'T BE BACK!!"

My husband said I didn't realize how much Ice Tea I had, lol. I took my 5 year old with us, and Tiger was so friendly with her and was asking her questions,  he also noticed that I was pregnant and got special treatment.  I loved it. The food was amazing.  The steak melted in your mouth. The rice is to die for and don't get me started on the sauces. Thank you Tiger for an amazing night.   we will be going back again,  hopefully soon. I also think that the prices are very reasonable for the type, quality,  and amount of food you get. We spent close to $275.00 on the 3 of us :)"

            "review": "Best teppanyaki steakhouse in Las Vegas hands down. I recommend always calling in advance to make reservations because they do get pretty busy and it's a hit or miss on weekdays. There are 2 sides you may sit at teppanyaki grill or dining/sushi bar. For teppanyaki I recommend requesting for Tiger (Owner) to be your chef. He is the best along with Young. Unlike other teppanyaki restaurants they have many different homemade very yummy dipping sauces to go with meal. \n\nTeppanyaki happy hour starts at Midnight!! Great food at a great price!! ..after 12am you could also request for the \"Dirty Adult Show\" perfect for bachelor/bachelorette parties or a good laugh.\n\nTiger hour is their Happy hour menu that starts at 11pm and can be order from both sides of the restaurant. Beto amd Jun are great sushi chefs!! You'll be in good hands."

They also offer Kobe beef, which was so yummy!!  I will definitely come here every time we come back to Vegas, for the amazing food, and also for a very entertaining show!  Our entire table enjoyed ourselves, and haven't laughed so hard in a long time! Go with a group, it's much more fun!

I made a reservation, left my name and number, and we showed up promptly.\n\nAfter checking in, we noticed the host had already crossed our name off. Either someone already checked in or they marked us off, even though we showed up on time. He did try and hide the fact that he screwed up, by highlighting through my name again. He told me the wait would be about 20 minutes. After we showed up on time for our reservations. He didn't admit a mistake or anything, just told us to have a drink at their bar. We sit down at the bar, no one is behind the bar, so we aren't offered water or an alcohol menu or anything. At least give us a cup of water if you messed up.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, a loud Asian lady starting screaming at us to follow her and guides us to a table. She then starts yelling at everyone being seated that we need to sit shoulder to shoulder to each other since they are fitting two more people than the table normally holds. This indicated to me that they did give our reservation away to someone else and trying to shoehorn everyone into a cramped space was the last straw.\n\nMe and my friend got up and told her that she could stop screaming at us, because there would be plenty of space with us gone. We ended up going to Ohjah, which had excellent service, great food, without having to deal with a host screw up and an old Asian lady screaming at us."

Apparently Musashi had a lunch special going on, $9.50 for a bento box - which was quite expensive compared to $.8.50 at RA by the Fashion Show Mall considering this place offered quite a shady atmosphere. It was a little secluded and just...dark for the most part, not exactly the kind of environment that favors a happy dining experience. \n\nWe ordered a bento with a choice of tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and shrimp/vegetable tempura. It came with miso soup, a potsticker, edamame and salad. Since we weren't too hungry, we asked for an extra bowl of rice only to find out later that additional rice orders were free...and for that I gave this review an extra star. The food was pretty good although I'd recommend Go Wild Sushi and Grill (on Tenaya and Sahara) a thousand folds over Musashi, taking everything into consideration. \n\nAt some point, we noticed how the place needed quite a make-over. The booth couches were ripping and the music wasn't very accomodating. Summing everything up, the restaurant left quite a lasting impression that won't have me going back for awhile. If you want better Japanese Restaurants, I'd recommend shuseki in Chinatown, RA at the Fashion Show Mall and Go Wild Sushi and Grill along Sahara to name a few."

Welcome to Musashi.\n\nGreat spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.\n\nThe classic teppanyaki \"show\" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.\n\nSteaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).\n\nDinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.\n\nOther menu items?  Who knows.  This is a TEPPANYAKI restaurant.  Get your sushi fix elsewhere.\n\nOpen till 4am.\n\nNote:  The Travel Channel's \"Steak Paradise II\" featured Musashi for their use of \"imported from Japan Kobe beef\".

Main thing to note is this is a good place to go if you're not expecting a fancy Teppanyaki restaurant and you realize it's a good deal for the price. \n\nFirst thing is on the website it says that late night happy hour starts at 11pm, this is half true. Late night happy hour dinner area starts at 11pm, teppanyaki starts at midnight. Sushi rolls vary from $3.50-5 wide variety smaller than normal. You can order off full sushi menu at full price. Teppanyaki Filet mignon $16, seafood (calamari, crab sticks (imitation crab), scallops, shrimp $18.50. Place is packed at midnight so reservations are a good idea. Waiters aren't the friendliest, ambiance is okay, clean but no benihana. Like I said, if you're looking for a fancy Japonese restaurant... this isn't for you. Small only 2 teppan sections / 4 stove stations. Locals place, big on group events. They don't start taking your order till 12:20am, start teppan cooking till at least 12:45am so if you arrive at midnight, just plan on waiting, however if you don't come right at 12 or a little before, you may not get a seat. Sushi bar is open so share a roll and that'll tie you over. 1 hour 45 min later meal was finished. Chef was very nice and friendly, apologized for our long wait and the food was delicious. Shout out to the Island Boy Nick for being a great waiter."

No.\nThe drinks were only free because we walked out after being treated rudely.\n\nWe made reservations for 8pm and were there 10 minutes early.  We were told that the table was not ready and we would need to wait a few minutes in the lounge.  We ordered a few drinks and continued to wait as the lounge filled up with others waiting.  We finished our drinks and were ready for more but realized it was already past 830 and we had plans later.\n\nI approached the podium and calmly said we had 800 reservations it is now 830 and we were told it would only be a few minutes at 750.  I asked when we would be seated.  The guy at the podium was haughty and replied with \"whenever it is ready.\"  Some others that were waiting had overheard our exchange and began talking saying they had been waiting since 730.  I headed to my party of 6 and told them that we would be leaving right now.  As we pasted by the podium another party had approached the podium.  I announced to all listening that we were not waiting and leaving.\n\nWe headed across the street to Del Frisco's, one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  They were friendly and sat us right away.  The service was a stark juxtaposition to those across the street.  Musashi's was just another example of the horrible service at a lot of the places in Vegas."

So let me preface my review with this:  I generally don't think of teppan as steak, because something about the meat being cubed and then cooked makes it lose a lot of that wonderful rare flavor that I love.\n\nThat said... I've had the best steaks of my life at musashi.  You know it's going to be a wonderful evening when you walk into musashi and see the Kobe beef certificate on display on the front podium -- it means that the Kobe is in and available that day. \n\nAnd by Kobe I don't mean that American, or New Zealand or Australian wagyu that a lot of restaurants try to pass off as \"Kobe\".  This is real. Certified. Kobe.\n\nIt's so different, delectable, wonderful, like bubbles of delicious flavor bursting in your mouth....and really, I feel like if you like steak, you shouldn't go through life without trying this place out at least once. (at least when Kobe is available)\n\nAs far as ambiance goes, it's a beautiful restaurant inside, decorated in a contemporary way with red and black incorporating traditional kimono and uchikake on the walls, it's a place that makes you feel really good to sit down in, yet not overly formal. \n\nWe've been here two times, and the second time we were able to get the owner as our chef, and I have to say -- it was a totally different and awesome experience.  He is by far the best and most entertaining teppan chef I have ever encountered -- couple that with the fact that he cooks custom sauces for your meat on the grill that are gourmet miracles, I highly suggest that you request him as your chef if you ever decide to go.\n\nEnd note:  The pricing here is really reasonable (I'd say 20-40 a person?), but if you're planning on getting the Kobe, be prepared to spend upwards of 100-150 per person."

The lobster was tasty and the steaks were all well cooked. The ice cream at the end and the fun celebrity pics topped it off."

For all the dippers out there, they make amazing dipping sauces. I had their ribeye and lobster tail...excellent. Their hidden gem was their soup which is very unique because of their added steak. The chef was rated R humorous (which I can see be taken offensively) during his show. Steaks are superb. Will definitely return to this place when we return to Vegas. Just a tip, the place is slightly off the strip. I advise taking a taxi and then letting them know to get a taxi for you when the bill arrives which we did and it was seamless. We loved it!!!"

You're paying for the show. I'm sorry, but if you've seen one onion volcano, you've seen them all. \n\nA group of 5 of us came after work one night at the request of one of the people in the group. We were seated about a half hour after waiting for a table. After looking over the menu I decided to with with the Samurai Special, filet mignon and shrimp, our waiter informed me that it wold be an extra $3.50 for fried rice, which I thought was bizarre, that usually comes with dinner automatically.\n\nWe were started out with miso soup. I immediately noticed there was a ton of oil in it. I could see it floating on the top, as well as some mystery meat. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce only, but I did like the ginger dressing. \n\nOnto our meal. Started out with grilled vegetables, he put a large chunk of butter down into them. Same with the shrimp. Same with the meat. I was in disbelief in regards to the amount of butter that was used. Garlic. He loved garlic as well. He thought it was so special to make garlic butter. It was overkill.\n\nSo our food comes, I can guarantee you that what I was served was not filet mignon. During dinner, one of the people in our group had requested more yum yum sauce. The \"chef\" reaches for the bottle of yum yum sauce and holds it in front of his junk as in gesturing something. He thought this was hilarious, the rest of us thought it was gross and innapropriate. I get that they have an adult dinner later, but we weren't apart of that. It was gross.\n\nAnywho, $60 for dinner and a single glass of wine. Totally not worth it."

Open only after 5 p.m. and it is conveniently open until 4 a.m. great for the late night cravings. They have a great and popular Teppenyaki area to the restaurant. If you do not know what Teppenyaki is, it is an area in where you sit around a grill and an entertaining chef grills your food and puts on a show for you.  Musashi also has a sushi bar as well as a dining room area. They have happy hour starting at 11p.m. making their sushi rolls very cheap at about starting at about $4 dollars. Being a usual for several years now, the wait staff as well as the sushi chef are very friendly. I have brought with me a few sushi skeptics that swore not to like sushi but were willing to try anyways and they ended up returning for more.\n \n By far my favorite sushi place I have been to a few different ones but I always come back to Musashi in the end. My three favorite rolls are the Christian roll, Shaggy Dog, and the 911. The Christian is a shrimp tempura roll with eel sauce. I may add that I love their eel sauce I make sure my Christian roll has a lot of it. The Shaggy dog roll is also a shrimp tempura roll topped with crab meat and a delicious creamy sauce. These two rolls also happen to be on the happy hour menu so they are about $5 dollars each. The 911 roll is a spicy tuna roll with topped with salmon I also love to drench this with their delicious eel sauce. Unless you can handle spicy food I would recommend sticking to the Shaggy or the Christian. As an appetizer I enjoy having their tofu and sea weed miso soup. I love how fast my sushi always comes out. I never wait no longer than 5 minutes to get a table. The ambiance is great there are as many locals as well as tourist who enjoy going to get a late snack. I like how even though it is open very late it is a family place, meaning that you can bring your kids with you if you get hungry on your way home from a long day. \n\n The few downfalls Musashi might have are that sometimes even though they are a clean place there is a strong sewer smell, which makes it a bit difficult to enjoy your food completely. Another downfall is that the Teppenyaki is always full so you must make reservations hours before you cannot just show up without a reservation. Sometimes even with a reservation you are kept waiting a while because something went wrong and they are running late on getting the others ahead of you out. \n \n Musashi being my favorite Japanese steak house, I would greatly recommend people to try it. From a great location, great prices, friendly staff and fast sushi service I would think everyone would enjoy it. Whether you are by yourself, on a date, a group of friends or a family, Musashi is the best place for a late dinner or even an after work snack."

The food is great, the fish extremely fresh (like, flown in that morning fresh), and they have a fantastic assortment of cut rolls, some very inventive. Prices are reasonable and you get a lot for your money, but as with any sushi place, you can run the bill up pretty quick if you don't watch yourself.\n\nOn the down side, the service is always only adequate - servers are OK, but always just a little hipper than you are, if you get my drift. And there is a slight, ever-present scent in the dining room... it might be natural gas, if it wasn't a little too greasy-smelling. \n\nBut overall, a great place, and since it's off the strip, it's never jammed full of loonies or too busy to seat you. I've never come away less than full and satisfied."

Make sure you tell them if it's someone's birthday- many fun surprises will be in store for them.  It's definitely more of a late night place, as the full price menu is a bit pricy.

He was raving about the food quality, the freshness of the ingredients and how it was a whole caliber above other teppanyaki chains.  Walking in we saw the swanky and posh interior, and I felt we could look forward to an awesome meal.  Unfortunately, me and my g/f this was as good as it was going to get, and left here very disappointed, which was unfortunate considering my family friend really hyped us up and considering we saw all the positive yelp reviews.  I will say we did go do go during lunch and maybe as a result you don't get the full experience that the dinner crowd gets, but I with all honesty I am basing most rating on the quality of the food we received.\n\nWe walked in and got seated fairly quickly, as there was a group of other walk-ins sitting and waiting.  I talked to the others sitting there, and found out one couple was sitting there for about 10 minutes and the other group of three people had been there for almost 30 minutes and still hadn't taken their order.  So needless to say, the other groups seemed slightly irritated because of the wait, but I guess I can see how it isn't exactly cost effective to do teppanyaki cooking for just two or three people.  But still sitting that long can be a little irritating.\n\nThe soup was a little on the salty side for my tastes, the soy sauce kinda covered up the overall flavors of the dish.  The lunch combination also came with some fried rice which was hot, and did have some crispy rice pieces, which was a nice thing, but I felt that the flavoring was a bit on the bland side.  The sauces that my friend told us about weren't being made in front of us, they were coming out of a squeeze bottle, one being miso based and the other tasted a little soy-citrus base... both were good, but didn't find it much different from the same sauces you get at Benihana.  The chef we got that day didn't seem that into it, he was there and cooking it, but didn't say very much or do much interacting with the guests at the table.  The only reason I bring this up, is that teppanyaki is supposed to be a show, part of the reason you usually pay for this is to be entertained while you eat.\n\nThe chef continued on and started to make or meals, I had tried some of the vegetable stir fry that my g/f ordered, probably the best thing I had during this meal, the veggies were well cooked, not over done and rubbery, nice light char on it and pretty well seasoned.  If I knew what was to follow I would have stopped eating here.  Next came the Steak and Prawns - While I went and asked for medium rare, he served it well down, the steak was a brick and the prawns were overcooked and rubbery.  My g/f and I shared a side a scallops which were once again, over cooked.  No moisture left in the disk shape brick we were given, it was inedible, we didn't bother finishing the dish.\n\nI was really disappointed in the meal, I really had high expectations for place based on the reviews and recommendation that I got.  I really wanted to like this place because I wanted to come back and do a late night food run and try their Okonomiyaki.  But after have such a bad lunch experience I don't think any amount of booze and drunk munchies could get me to come back on this trip.  Ill give them a try down the road for dinner, maybe it will be better experience...  But in the mean time I gotta go call my friend and give him a hard time about that recommendation."

There were a couple of rolls that were pretty good but I honestly think they only seemed good because we were desperate for something to be good!  \n\nThe service was poor, including the hostess up front. They were basically unorganized. \n\nAnd finally, the lighting in the dining area was horrible. It felt like we had a spot light on us throughout our dinner.

Yup. \n\nAfter figuring out how to get inside, we were immediately greeted by a foul smell that was similar to sweaty socks. Not something you want too smell at a restaurant. Normally we would have left, but we had 9pm reservations and everyone seemed to be raving about the food.\n\nWe were seated at a teppanyaki style table alone. After a few minutes another party of 2 joined, followed by an additional party of 5. All guys.\n\nWe got our drinks, gave in our order and waited. and waited. and waited. Finally at about 9:35 our salads arrived. Now, I'm from NYC and every hibachi place I've been too, we've never been longer then an hour. Here, we were already 35 minutes in with just our salads and no chef in sight. The salad was bland and wasn't very appetizing. The soup arrived a few minutes later which was actually really good. Definitely one of the only good things about this meal.\n\nFinally at 9:50, just as we were about to complain, our chef arrived. He noticed I was the only girl at the table and proceeded to make a heart out of oil and say \"Thats for you!\". I thought it was a kind gesture until I turned around and heard him say \"This is also for you!\" To my surprise, he was holding a wooden penis. Yes you just read that right. A wooden penis. Wtf. I think I died a little inside, but laughed it off. Was totally turned off by this and I kinda just sat there in shock for a few minutes.\n\nLet me just be the one to say this - I hate when teppanyaki places serve your rice first. By the time any of the other food gets to you, theres no more rice. This was probably the least annoying thing of the entire experience. EXCEPT - for when the penis flashing chef insisted we all try his \"cream\". Please don't take that out of context. One minute I'm eating my rice, the next minute he's forcing some yellowish sauce type cream on the other half of my rice. I took one bite of it and hated it. \nIt was terrible. Why would this guy ruin my rice like that?!\n\n The food was just completely mediocre and absolutely nothing to write home about. I'll probably never come back, or even ever consider it. I think if I was dying of hunger right outside of this place I'd still consider the gum stuck on the sidewalk then go in and have a meal here."

I have been to japanese steakhouses in the past, but this place is (pardon the pun) a cut above. Tiger's knife work is top notch, and the food is excellent. I don't eat sushi, so I cannot comment on that side of the restaurant, but I can say I had a wonderful time, and thoroighly enjoyed the experience. Tiger was funny, talented, and had me laughing the whole time, when I wasn't shoveling some of the best food I have had in y ears in my face. really a good place to eat."

We love local spots (we search for holes in the wall in every new city we visit) and this fit the bill perfectly. We also eat sushi about twice a week and this was some of the best we have ever had. Prices are good ($7-$15 a roll or upwards for lobster), the fish is fresh and the service is very fast and friendly. The menu is comprised of over 60 uniquely named specialty roles (i.e... white boy and J in the mouth). It is located only about a mile from the strip (we stayed at the Venetian and the cab ride was $10). I highly recommend this place instead of the ridiculously priced mediocre sushi places located in some strip hotels. We also inquired about desert roles, to which the chef said they did not have on their menu, then he surprised us with a roll made with oranges at the end of our meal, no charge!! Very very happy with Musashi!!"

This is hands down, thee best place for Japanese food!  \n\nThe food is to die for, waaaayyyyyyy better than any other Japanese steakhouse you'll ever go to.   I always get the steak and lobster.  The meal comes with steak (cooked however you like), lobster, shrimp, vegetables, and (fried) rice.  TIP: TRY NOT TO EAT ALL THE FRIED RICE BEFORE THE WHOLE MEAL IS SERVED...it's hard not to eat all the fried rice, but it's just so darn good!  The steak is SO flavorful, it's cooked on a bed of garlic and is so soft and tender and juicy.  The shrimp goes well with the sweet mayo sauce, one of my faves.  And the lobster is so awesome as well, it comes with butter and garlic and lemon.  They have a good choice of domestic and Japanese beer, as well as sake, and also some mixed drinks.  I love their azuki bean ice cream as well!\n\nIt's always fun to watch the chefs cook and they do amazing tricks, as well as make your food taste sooooooooooo good!  Our favorite chef is Tiger!  He's very funny, friendly, and cooks the food the best!  WARNING: Some people may find his humor a little offensive, but my family and I think it's hilarious!  So if you have a \"prude\" you're bringing to the restaurant, this is just a heads up!\n\nEvery time I go to Las Vegas, I HAVE to come here.  I tell everyone I know about this restaurant!  And that's why I'm writing this review!  I will continue to come back and enjoy my food with great people and great memories!"

Our chef's name was Joan (sp?), and he was awesome!!! So friendly and funny. Our party had 10 people total, including one child and another minor, and he balanced the conversation and focus very well. \n\nNot to mention the food was stellar! I had low expectations because I'd been to Benihana before, and that experience definitely paled in comparison, both in showmanship and in cuisine. I always thought teppanyaki was more about the show than about the food, as oxymoronic as that sounds. Joan proved me wrong! The fried rice was absolutely delicious, the shrimp and chicken I ordered were juicy and flavorful, and the sauces he created were out of this world! I'm drooling at the mere memory...\n\nI wanted to lick my plate before we left. Seriously. The next time I go to Vegas, Musashi will be at the top of my list!"

I was a bit surprised because teppanyaki isn't a normal bachelor party type of meal, but hey, he's the bachelor.  In any case, we were served by the owner of the place (the same guy the bachelor saw on TV).  He told me his Japanese name but I forgot it just as he said I would and I remember his nickname of \"Tiger\" because he wears a tiger striped chefs hat.  \n\nI've eaten a lot of teppanyaki in my time.  They're all pretty good, but in then end, meh.  They're all the same. With that said, this place is not the same.  This place is a cut above the rest.  The ingredients here were definitely better, the number of sauces they provided were greater, and the entertainment was much, much better.  With that said, they entertained us like we were a bachelor party, which we were.  So you might not get that part if you eat here but you'll definitely get the food which is the best teppanyaki I've ever had.\n\nOrder the Miyazaki beef.  It's like butter.  Look it up.  It's better than the overhyped Kobe beef that's on every other menu in the States. Though in actuality, I've learned that in most of the cases, what you're getting is not true Kobe beef.  So maybe they are comparable. They're both from the same Wyagu breed."

My wife got the filet mignon/shrimp combo.  I got the NY strip/salmon combo.  The fried rice is $3.50 and well worth it.  We were also served a bevy of vegetables including zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts all cooked to perfection.  I actually preferred the sirloin over filet here since they chop it up and put a lot of sauce on it.  We were also able to try a portion of the scallops due to a wrong order and those were really good too.  \n\nI get Misti Y's \"shabby\" comment regarding the interior.  The teppanyaki area felt kind of basementy but you kind of forget about it once the chef starts.  The bar area seemed pretty makeshift too.  It wasn't exactly an area you'd spend an hour at.  \n\nOn a side note, maybe it's me being a snob but I scoff at people that order well done steaks.  I know it's a personal choice that I should respect but why would you want to do that to a steak?  No less than 4 people at our table ordered well done!  Their raw cuts of filet looked quite different than the others that ordered rare or medium rare.  Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight up didn't want any vegetables even in their fried rice.  Grown people!  More for the rest of us!!"

The chef wasn't that good at doing his little tricks, but he was still entertaining. It was during normal hours, and I fell in love with their fried rice and mushrooms. \nThree days later, I came really late at night during their happy hour. We ordered about the same amount food like last time. The server told us it's 50% off so we get half the portions, but it's the same exact food as the normal menu. So we ordered twice as much. \n\nHere comes the chef who looked at us like, \"great some of my customers are 12 year olds.\" Just because we look young, doesn't mean you start downgrading your service (I despise servers like that, and yes, we do look like 12 year olds). I told him twice before he started that no onions on any of our food (my bf is allergic), and he said, \"I'm going to put lots of onions.\" He said it in a joking way, but I said it again after just to be sure. He started doing his thing, and he cooked fried rice for the other customers first WITH onions and then he used to same grill to cook our fried rice without cleaning it. The previous chef we had was not like that. He acknowledged our request, and he put us first. Our fried rice had onions...good thing we're smart enough to check. He got even worse when it came to the veggies. He cooked the veggies all at once for everybody, and gave us veggies with onions. Then he goes, \"It might have a little onion.\" After that I was so done. I wasn't going to complain anymore because to me this restaurant doesn't exist. I was planning on taking my family here for my graduation dinner, but no thanks. He didn't even give us any mushrooms...he gave all the mushrooms to everybody else. I love mushrooms. I thought we were supposed to get the exact same thing as regular menu. We paid the same amount we did for the regular menu. I hate this place with a burning passion. Please, train your chefs what \"No onions!\" mean, and how to provide service."

He kept our large group of 11 entertained the entire meal, with his dirty jokes and various gag toys.  Lots of fun and good food, which puts this place at the top of my teppanyaki list.\n\nFirst off, he creates about 7 different sauces for everyone (half of them made on the teppan grill).  The tricks start right from the beginning, with veggies and fried rice cooked before your main entree.  I ordered the Steak Lovers special, which included 3 cuts of beef, which included some kobe imported from Japan.  This included some special fried rice, which was made with some kobe beef fat.  The fried rice was solid and I was glad it was seasoned very well and not overly soy saucey.  It was hilarious when he started to pack a penis cake mold with fried rice and... haha just check my photo and you'll see.  I almost forgot the house soup that came out to start, which was this peppery short rib broth soup, which was delicious.  I also tried some of the rolls my friends ordered and they were pretty good.\n\nThe place is about a mile off the strip and the cab cost was around $8 from the Venetian.  It's a short trip from the strip and you could easily walk there if the weathers nice.  Also, be sure to make reservations and request Tsutomu when doing so."

Very moist and tasty as it was covered in Teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was just about right, not an over dominating flavor.\n\nThis was followed by the NY Steak and Rib-Eye.  I have no idea what a NY Steak is doing in a Japanese Restaurant....but that was what we had ordered.  The Rib-Eye was a much better cut, soft and tender, juicy and topped off with some Teriyaki Sauce.  The NY Steak was done the same way, not too bad...I can't complain much about the NY Steak...just that my preference would be the Rib-Eye.\n\nAs we were half way through our meal...the rolls began to come.\n\nThe 99% roll came first and was all too good to not eat one piece but you just had to eat 2 pieces or more.\n\nWe had one more roll coming.....and our server had just informed me that our Ex-Girlfriend will be a little late.  DARN!!  I picked up my phone and called my Ex....she's late as usual....\n\nOk....I need to settle down a little....I should have gone for the Porn Star instead.....would have been rolling in style.  So finally our Ex-Girlfriend shows up and we just devour her as quickly as we can.   To my surprise it was very good.  Crab, avocado, spicy tuna with halibut tempura and spicy mayo.\n\nNext time I'm going for the Porn Star, she'll be at the table before the Ex-Girl Friend.  I'm also looking forward to their Kama Sutra roll next time.\n\nOverall, the meal was exotic, climatic with loads of orgasmic flavors.  Such an explosive meal....off to the next event.  Will be back for the Porn Star for sure!!\n\nPlace was clean, bathrooms clean, not too loud and a nice atmosphere.  \n\nA restaurant to try when in Vegas!!  \n\n4 Stars"

The cook had to yell to him to come out and take us to a table, really strange. The food was so-so, and you're at one of those big metal tables where the chefs do the chopping in front of you, so there's not much privacy for conversation, and the chopping and jokes the chef makes entertained the kids at the table but I just thought it was annoying."

After sampling the yum yum sauce as well as the ridiculously delicious fried rice, I tried to convince the chef to move to Arizona. The chicken was tender and perfection. Don't forget to add sake. We enjoyed the Kurosawa and Drunken Whale. Also, be sure to tell them you like the fat on your steak. They will grill it up and incorporate it into a sauce that will make you propose to the chef--who would only identify himself as Sum Yung Cook. You're always welcome in Tucson Sum Yung Cook!"

So we asked the sushi chef if we could sit anywhere. He said yes. So we picked a table and waited a few more minutes and no one came over. Then the sushi chef asked if we could move to the sushi bar as the waitress was busy in the teppanyaki room. (The restaurant is split in half, a teppanyaki side and a sushi side.) So we moved to the sushi bar. After the initial confusion with getting service, things went find.\n\nI ordered Lunch Box A with a spicy tuna roll and teriyaki salmon. Both were quite good. The salmon was a little hard to eat with chopsticks but was cooked well.\n\nThe meal was served with Miso soup which was a great start on a cold and rainy day. It was hot and flavorful.\n\nThe box came with edamame, a gyoza, and salad. All of which were very good.\n\nThe box was around $11 which is a little more than I like to pay for lunch, but it was worth it. I'll be back."

The shrimp that he made look like little bunnies, sat on the grill for way too long and actually started to darken and toughen up.\n\nThe fried rice had hard pieces in it because it sat on the grill too long as well. \nWe both ordered the filet for our entrees and it was overcooked from how we requested it.\n\nI was pleased that he offered a variety of sauces but that didn't take away from the over cooking of the main dishes.\n\nAside from the chef being more entertaining, I would have been happy to have gone to a Benihana instead. I don't know if this was a fluke or not and I may give this place another chance but based on my one experience, I would be hard pressed to not go somewhere else."

But still had it in my memory to come here on my next trip to Vegas. I'm so glad I remembered to come here, Musashi did not disappoint. I've been to a few tepenyaki place before, this one had to top my list of best tepenyaki style restaurants. \n\nI called to make reservations, just about 30 mins ahead of time with no problem. This was on a Thursday night, so I'm sure on weekends, you probably want to make a bit more of an advance reservation. Once we got there, we were seated immediately and waited a few mins for other reservations to fill our community table. Me and my friends ordered a few appetizers and sushi before our meals. Yaka-tori skewers...tiny portion but delicious! \n\nWe ordered our main entrees, and a few minutes after the Tepenyaki chef came out with a tray full of fresh meats and sauces. The tepen chef spoke broken English, and sometimes was a bit hard to understand but enough for him to make it an enjoyable dinner. He was funny and friendly. He even had the \"barrel-man\" to make us laugh...and for you ol' school Filipinos out there, you know the \"barrel-man\". lol! \n\nI had the chicken and prawns with fried rice, my other friends had the new york steak, and salmon and prawns. All of it awesome! Put it like this, by the end of the dinner all of us sitting at the table had empty plates and full stomaches! The infusion of sauces were incredible. The cooking and entertainment were all bonuses. if you've never eaten at a tepenyaki style restaurant, I highly suggest you give it a try, especially if your in Vegas next time. Try Musashi Like they said on the travel channel, top tepenyaki style restaurant in the nation. I would have to agree!"

But, I guess the upside is that these shows do work and get people through the door.  The bar wasn't huge and on the dark side.  But, that was fine with me, it was good ambiance.  Also, the price for JW Black wasn't crazy.  Good pour.\n\nWe had a very fun table, everyone was into it and had a good time.  I've found at teppanyaki joints this is key, the more your fellow diners are into it, the better of a time you tend to have.  Our table was full and people were into it.  Also, the group wasn't entirely tourists, I'd say it was at least 50% locals.\n\nThe starters were standard for this type of meal.  Our chef was very colorful and more skilled than many other teppanyaki chefs I've had in the past.  \n\nWe had the Musashi special, which is basically every meat they have.  The steak was cooked exactly to order.  The seafood (shrimp and lobster) was very tender and not overcooked, but also not undercooked.  The sauces were excellent accompaniments, and the fried rice was very good.  I've had much worse at similar places.\n\nService was fantastic, ready when we needed more drinks, but certainly didn't distract from the show.  Great night.  Recommended."

Sure, you've got your typical teppanyaki chefs who flip spatulas, toss salt shakers, and throw in the occasional cheesy joke. This Chef, however, was highly talented and extremely hilarious. Dirty jokes galore, witty comebacks to our stupid drunken comments, and foul props made this experience a true show! Not to worry, no need to get decked out and dressed up either, very down to earth, casual restaurant.\n\nFood was phenomenal. The Chef took pride in his cooking, insisting we try certain foods without dipping in sauce first to really taste the talent. I got the filet mignon and prawns dinner. Meat was quality, seasoning was perfect with a special mayonnaise like sauce on the prawns. Fried rice was moist, and my favorite part was a special little treat the Chef concocted with the trimmed fat off steaks. I only wished the dish also had chow mein.\n\nChef made so many house made sauces that I couldn't even figure out what to dip my food in, they were all awesome.\n\nFor 7 people, stuffed outta our minds, beer and sake filled, and cheeks (on the face, to clarify) hurting from laughing...

I had shrimp and scallops and I'm really particular about people over cooking seafood but it was right where it should be- perfectly cooked scallops are hard to find!. He would tell us random drunk stories and how he got his job- apparently the owner is his brother in law. He doesnt seem to have a tight routine show as some of the other teppan-tainers but kinda fun winging it feel. It has some appeal that hes personal with us, like he's a buddy telling us his misadventures while they're hosting dinner. \n\n2nd time was we had a visitor so the whole family- my bf, his mom and grandma and his uncle from Amsterdam came here so our visitor can experience something different. This time we had Tiger, the owner. I got shrimp and steak this time and it was pretty good again.  His routine is the best, but its a show routine hes had time to put down. He also had a few extra sauces that the first time we did not get and fried potatoes. My BF does not like fat usually (but I do!) - here they get the fat if you order a NY steak and cut it up and reduce it down and put sauce on it....he loved it! Not too fatty/greasy at all, but more of a tasty concentrated morsel of beefy flavor in teriyaki sauce.  Our guest was happy and mom and grandma liked it. They are light eaters and they allowed them to split an entree which was perfect for them so just a tip for light eaters to maybe see if you can share. Even for me, a big eater, one meal combo gets me hella stuffed! \n\nTHEORY ABOUT LUNCH:\n\nSeems like a lot of the bad reviews are from the lunch time. From what I know about teppans lunches are usually the times when the novice teppan cooks are up to practice on smaller crowds. Could explain the difference in pricing from lunch to dinner here and a lot of comments that it wasn't so entertaining and more just cooking . Some of the same ingredients, but maybe dinner are the skilled chefs who know how to entertain and cook (the owner after all usually mans one of the teppans at dinner).For a entertaining experience and quality control warrants a higher price- to me its fair. Havent confirmed this, but just a theory about trainees and maybe I'll ask next time I'm there as well as try to catch a lunch teppan to really rate this place as a whole. I'm sure though dinner isn't always perfect either. I've been cooking for a long time and like to talk, but when guests and distractions are about even I can f*** up some of my star dishes.\n\n So far my experiences have been good here and I have been to a lot of teppan spots.\n\nDinner prices are fair- even Benihana charges comparable rates for combos meats at dinner time so its not pricier than another teppan, but I feel I get better quality here and Tiger is awesome. I like that you can go all out and have a wide range of teppan meats here unlike others, but I probably would not go and spend the hundred for the kobe. I enjoy the seafood platters though so I'll probably splurge on a lobster tail eventually. \n\nFun for big parties, 2nd time we shared with another small party, but they were cool peeps so no complaints about that, but just more fun when it's only among friends.\n\nComing back to try a lunch teppan and would love to do the late night small plates in the dining side."

Both on the sushi side & on the teppanyaki side.  We prefer the teppanyaki side because who doesn't love a super fresh meal with a good show?!  My usual order is the chicken & shrimp (Katana).   When I need a little something different, I go for the salmon & shrimp (Ninja).   It comes with salad (yummy sweet ginger dressing), a beef soup (DELICIOUS), a shrimp appetizer, veggies, the meats (with your choice of sauce) & rice.  For a small fee, you can upgrade to the fried rice.  I highly suggest you opt for the fried rice.  It's so worth it.  \n\nWe have also ordered some of the sushi rolls to start off & our favorite is the \"J in Your Mouth\" which is a deep fried Philadelphia roll (salmon, avocado & cream cheese) with eel & spicy mayo drizzled on top.  We are also huge fans of the spicy shrimp roll & lobster roll.  As for drinks - make sure you try one of their flavored saketinis!  My favorite is the white peach.  I also enjoy the raspberry.\n\nWe have a preference to ask for Tiger (the owner & best chef in my opinion) when we visit because he does make some different sauces that none of the other chefs make.  Plus we love his overall attitude.  He aims to please the customers he is cooking for & if there is anything that can be done to make you more comfortable or if you have any specific restrictions (dietary or otherwise), he & his staff make sure to accommodate you any way they can.  I have taken my daughters (one of them is in a wheelchair - the restaurant is totally ADA compliant & convenient) & other family members who have all enjoyed themselves.  Tiger puts on a great family show for the kids.  If you're looking for something a little more adult - he can absolutely do that as well!  Some of our favorite late night memories with a bunch of friends has taken place here! \n\nI think the main reason it's taken so long to write this review is because I had too many positive things to say.  It is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas & whenever we get the chance, we visit.  We also make sure to recommend it to everyone we know looking for somewhere delicious to go.  Heck, we have friends that refuse to come to Vegas & meet us anywhere else!  We are always happy to make that happen.  :)"

The Chief's  amazing talent always dazzles you with a showy performance. I recommend getting teppanyaki of New York Steak & Chicken combination. A huge per portion, where I could never seem to finish, of chicken, steak, fried rice, and vegetables . Food is cooked right in front of you, so it does take time. If you are truly hungry & need something to tie you over before the meal, Shaggy dog Roll is a great way to start. A shrimp tempura roll that is topped with crab meat & drizzled with Musashi's famous \"Man Sauce\". You can find me there at least once a week."

We got three rolls with salmon--the Washington Roll, the Salmon supreme, and Sex on the Beach. For all three the salmon was super fresh and had an excellent taste. We also ordered pork gyoza which I enjoyed but the wife not so much, and Beef Negimaki  which were ok but the wife liked more than me. I would stick with the sushi or sashimi here. The service was friendly and efficient. I thought that the prices were reasonable. Overall, it was a very good experience. If I stay in that part of Vegas again I would definitely consider returning."

            "review": "I've been eating teppan style cooking on special occasions since around 1980 when Benihana was the only player in town..so I've had a few. Musashi wasn't busy on a week night and there was only 2 tables the whole time we were there so there was a little lack of atmosphere you find in busier places. The whole experience depends on the chef you get. Over the years I've had drunk chefs, chefs that were maybe the first day on the job but for the most part I've had skillful chefs. Our chef admitted up front he was enjoying his day off with some drinks and someone didn't show for work so he was called in. I've been in his boat so could understand. It showed in his juggling with the spatula and fork and when it got to the egg toss it wasn't so good. There were a lot of things lacking like tossing stuff and catching it in his hat or tossing food so you try to catch it in your mouth. I think we got the \" I shouldn't really be here cooking for you guys\" show. I ordered a bottle of chilled sake and it showed up in a ceramic sake flask. I've never seen that before. My son worked in a sushi restaurant and any sake showing up in a ceramic flask is the really cheap stuff. The food itself was O.K, perhaps a little overcooked and $3.50 for fried rice which had little else in it a bit overpriced. Musashi does give you extra sauces, chili paste and schriaca if you like spicy and he did make a garlic butter sauce but the presentation was lacking as he only got part of the sauce in the containers. The adult part of the show where he slaps rice into a penis shaped mold was a bit tacky. We were entertaining guests from a small town in the U.K so they probably never noticed it was sub par. Think we're going to stick with Toyko Waco in Los Angeles."

Don't miss the sushi while you wait for your place at the grill. We had tempura with avocado. Awesome. If you're up for it, the chefs will tease in really racy ways (careful ladies if the chef says he's buying you a beer, it comes as a penis beer bong!). Wasn't expecting that! Overall excellent fun and delicious food! Prices, fun, and quality 1000x better than Beni Hana."

Every time I come here, service is always on point and food is always delicious! \n\nThe last time I came here, the group I came with did the happy hour special. Definitely a must-try late night food place!\n\nI did the seafood combo that comes with miso soup, fried rice, shrimp, scallops and fish! It also comes with many different sauces made to order from the chef all for only $20! (Happy hour special) Because I went with a big group of early to mid 20's age, the teppan yaki chef made funny after-hour remarks! The chef was so funny and very accommodating. \n\nI went here for my mom's birthday as well a few months ago and I went with my family. The chef was so nice and funny.. he was not going to do some \"adult\" jokes. Instead, he cooked the fried rice in a heart-shaped form and was trying to make my grandma laugh! My family enjoyed it and they loved the food!\n\nI love this off-the-strip spot! A local hot spot, a tourist favorite, and you might spot a celebrity here or there! If you're in Vegas, you should try place!"

            "review": "The hibachi restaurant design is likely either hit or miss and in Vegas we are certainly not limited on the hibachi department. Enter Musashi, the small four table restaurant that most probably don't know exists except for the foodies who reviewed it to begin with. It is a no nonsense kind of restaurant, the kind that wouldn't seat me when I was 5 minutes early even though it was empty.\n\nBut of course the real question: what sets this place apart from the rest? Two things:\n\n1) There are some unique menu items that you won't find at other hibachi locations. For example, quail eggs wrapped in bacon that explode in your mouth. Pretty darn good. In addition they have some kobe beef options that some hibachi restaurants might not have, although the upper scale ones probably still will.\n\n2) Sauce heaven. If you go to a hibachi restaurant you usually can expect 2-3 sauces to go with your food. And they can range from decent to amazing. Well here you get 7 or 8 that they prepare at varying stages during the performance. It can seem overwhelming but there's a great variety in flavors that are worth trying. Of course I had finished my food by sauce 5 not realizing there would be more.\n\nOverall the food quality was pretty good but not mind blowing. Of course the quality of food at a hibachi place probably has a cap and this was up there but I've had better. The ginger salad wasn't my favorite version and the soup decent enough. It's kind of a restaurant of gimmicks. One of the sauces they give isnt even a sauce it's just tiny pieces of fat from the steaks that were cut off at the beginning and turned into a little treat at the end of the meal. Tasty and cute but silly.\n\nMy rating is comparative to other hibachi restaurants and the fact is that Ive had better food at the benihana in the Westgate. That might be because I had a special waiter there who would give me 100 dollars of free food but yolo. Musashi is great and is worth going to definitely but not the best there ever was in teppanyaki."

The chefs are good at what they do, and it's nice that they make several of the sauces for your meat and veggies right there as you watch.  Some things don't change from place to place, you get the corny jokes, the lighting things on fire, etc.  Here however, you better be ready for some rated R things as well.  So if you get offended by anything having to do with the male anatomy, tell your chef before hand so they won't make those jokes. The time I ate there with my mother I wasn't sure if she was gonna laugh or yell at the guy, but thankfully my mom's sense of humor prevailed.\n\nOn the whole, I would go back there for the food, but I kind of wish they would update the interior and do something about the smell, I know it's keeping first time customers away."

We found out about the place while watching the food network channel. food network channel say whaaat!?? That's right.\n\nSo with that being said and it being my first time attending the place I'd have to say is by far one of the best teppanyaki places i have been to. Compared to the famous benihana's this place is say is 100x times better. Our chef was not only skilled at cooking but was really funny and entertaining as well. The Fillet minion was very delicious. The Steaks are fresh and tender. Great variety of dipping sauces. Best sauces i ever tasted in any Japanese restaurant. The steaks are served by itself or as a surf and turf with lobster or shrimp. I recommend you bringing someone here for a birthday. Only because your birthday guests will get a lovely birthday surprise with their meal. \n\nThe Place opens till 4am. Its one of those places that is closed for a couple hours between lunch and dinner between 3pm-5pm I believe. So anytime before or after you will be able to get in. Reservations aren't necessary. A very popular spot w/ celebrities. Again highly recommended. A great place for entertainment. Enjoy!"

We had the Chili Tempura, Vegetable entree and the fried rice. The miso soup that it came with was smoky and perfect. The sauces - they need a review of their own!! Go ahead and try all of them, my favorite was the red chili hot sauce. Smokin' hot. \n\nOur chef was John, and he was a hoot. I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Vegas."

They put on a show on the grill! (not gonna spoil it for you) but whoo that thing gets HOT (temperature and quality) haha.  Anyways, I got the chicken and the shrimp, but you can pick whatever you want such as steak, lobster, etc.  Its just gets a little pricey. obvi.  That comes with fried rice and grilled veggies.  The rice is so amazing.  Probably one of the best fried rice ever especially with that man sauce drizzled all over it (ask for it!) It's a secret, thank me later! I wonder if I could take a bottle of it to go and bring it back to california. Muhaha.  The shrimp and the chicken are really good too! Overall, the food is garlic-y and super savory. MMM.  I chefs are very generous too, gave us extra rice and meat! The portions are big enough though!\n\ni only deducted a star because the time I went which was around 2am (after the club) haha, the wait was so long! Not because there was so many people, the service.  I don't know if that is a regular thing or because it was late night? I was quite disappointed and very impatient.  However, the man sauce made up for the rest of the review. \n\nGet the crunch roll for a little appetizer, made the wait somewhat bearable."

The food overall was very good. \n\nWe did the teppanyaki and we had a reservation for 6 people at 6pm.  Setting the reservation itself was very easy I called around 10 am and they answered right away. However, when I called back a couple times there was no answer and around 4:30 I got a text (they ask for your phone number when you make the reservation) asking if we could come at 5:30. I told them that was not possible as we had made the reservation for 6 and weren't back at our hotel yet and they said they would just try and make it work...\n\nWe arrived a little before 6 to make sure we were on time since we were going to be there at 5:30, but unfortunately since we we're sat with other people who didn't show up until 6:15 we had to wait for them.  I know that is not the restaurants fault but some information and even drinks before the other people arrived would have been great. We were sat at the table for 15 minutes without having someone come by.  The girls that were late finally got there and we were able to order. \n\nThe chef came over around 6:45/7 since he was working on the table next to us when we first got there. Like I said the food was very good and the scallops and shrimp that I got were very well flavored.  The only issue I had was with the chefs jokes.  I get that out table was all older but the raunchy jokes and even the things that he did with the food to make it sexual was a little too much.  Our whole group was feeling like it was being taken too far.  \n\nOverall, I may go back if I am in Vegas since it is always fun for a big group and the food was good, but I would make sure we had a bigger group so we wouldn't have to wait on people who were late and I would maybe ask for a different chef."

The only reason I did not give this place a 5-star review is because the actual servers can be aloof and they are not the friendliest when you walk in.\n\nI ordered the Musashi Special, which comes with: filet mignon, prawns, scallops, and a lobster tail. Each of the specials also comes with a salad, soup (delish mix of onions, mushrooms and beef), fried rice, veggies, and a shrimp appetizer. \n\nOur Teppan chef, Nick, was awesome! He really made our 2.5-hour experience completely fun and enjoyable. Yes, they can be pretty raunchy   during the show as described by other Yelpers, but that will only happen if they get that vibe from your table (our table was open to it, so he went there).\n\nAll of the food was great - well prepared and flavorful. The sauces they prepare are no joke. They are great! Nick made us their usual sauces and also additional sauces that he thought that we would enjoy.  Spot-on!\n\nThe meal ended with ice cream (not all meals include it). The green tea ice cream is really good.\n\nAll in all, this is a really fun place with great food. I will definitely be back."

Before I could question why, the owner had turned and left the hostess stand. We waited approximately 15 minutes, didn't see a soul before we finally decided that they were rude, unapologetic and we would take our business to a restaurant that wanted customers.

It had already started to decline somewhat in popularity amongst the locals.  I had tried a few in town and settled on Hyakumi, although a bit pricy, as the best of the bunch on the strip.  Well that is now closed too, Caesars is going to make a new restaurant concept in the place after over 25 years.\n\nBased on a couple of my Yelp friends reviews I had bookmarked this place off the strip several years ago.  Well I was on an eating frenzy this trip and made it over here.  If you are not a fan of community table eating of any kind then find someplace else.  At least 90% of the time I have enjoyed my table companions and this was no exception.\n\nThe food and the show were great!  And reasonably priced for what it is, expect $50-90 depending on what you order with a single glass of beer or wine and tax+tip.  If you want an adult themed show go late to avoid the family crowd.  I got lucky and, even though it was early. there were no young kids at the tables so the young cook was playing to the 20 something ladies I was sharing the table with.  They stay open to 4AM to cater to the crowd that works on the strip.\n\nThis is a place worth staying sober to drive to and from or paying the taxi fare!"

The chef always puts on an elaborate show with acrobatic shrimp and flying vegetables to entertain and wow the guests.  You will always leave this place  fully stuffed and drunk (well at least me lol)!\n\nIf you come to Teppanyaki restaurants often, you will often get tired of the same routine they pull, so it's best to go once in a while or bring friends who never experienced it themselves. But the food is always delicious so I don't mind some of the acts getting old really.\n\nMy favorite is the Musashi Special, it comes with Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,\nfried rice and choice of ice cream all for $58. It's a lot of food so be prepared. Here is the list of the main Teppanyaki entrees.\n\nMusashi Special 58.00\nFilet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,\nfried rice and choice of ice cream\n\nSteak Lovers Special 90.00\nKobe beef, New York steak and filet mignon\n\nKimono Special 22.50\nSukiyaki steak and chicken breast\n\nGeisha Special 26.75\nNew York Steak and chicken breast\n\nKatana Special 24.00\nChicken breast and prawns\n\nRonin Special 32.00\nPrawns and scallops\n\nNinja Special 29.00\nSalmon filet and prawns\n\nThey also have sushi and sushi rolls. I've tried a lot of them and all of them are very good comparable to actual specialized sushi restaurants. This place is also open late (4.a.m.) If you never tried Japanese Teppanyaki, this is a good first place to try!"

She had been here before and raved about how great the teppanyaki was.\n\nWhen we walked in there was no hostess, we walked up to the bartender and asked if we had to seat ourselves, he ended up calling a waiter over. My friend asked if we could do the teppanyaki, we were told we could but not until 9:30 p.m. because we didn't have reservations. We didn't know it was mandatory to make one. We had a show to go to so we sat down to dine in the main dining area instead. I ended up ordering the following items: \n\nPork Gyoza- $4.50\nShrimp Dragoons- $6.00\nNY Steak (Hot Iron)- $18.00\n\nThe NY steak entree included miso soup, salad, fried vegetables (they no longer offer mashed potatoes), and steamed white rice. When ordering the steak it could either be served teriyaki style or just plain salt and pepper with a side of oroshi ponzu sauce. I opted to go with the salt and pepper. I ordered my steak well done and it was still very juicy and tender, I didn't end up touching the vegetables because they consisted of onions, zucchini (my arch nemesis), and carrots.The miso soup came with mushrooms, scallions, and little pieces of meat, it had a little kick, it was very flavorful. The salad was just iceberg lettuce topped with ginger dressing which was really good, it was sweet but not overpowering. The shrimp dragoons were a-okay, they're just like crab rangoons except they have shrimp instead of crab. I'll most likely skip ordering them next time. I ordered the pork gyoza steamed, but you can also order it fried, it was good, the pork had a nice salty taste. I really wanted to try the cream balls but they are no longer part of the menu. Our waiter said they were changing a lot of the things on the menu because I noticed some parts of the menu were blacked out. \n\nOur waiter was very attentive throughout the whole meal, we never even had to ask him for any refills because as soon as we were done with 3/4 of our drink, he'd bring more out. I was really happy with our service and meal. I will be back because I really want to try the teppanyaki but I'll make sure to set a reservation next time."

They got hung up at Bodies the Exhibit and finally around 8:30, we met up outside Marrakech.  It was closed.  For super bowl Sunday.  What?\n\nAnyway, we were all starving and next door was Musashi.  Inviting, but above all open, we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant was empty aside from one gentleman at the bar, and the four of us were seated at a comfy round booth.  All of us decided on sushi.  My guy and I had the ugly redhead, da bomb, j in my mouth, and something else that I don't remember.  I also got a seaweed salad.  Birthday boy had two mai tais and said they were very good.  He and his fiance also had the sexy redhead roll, and some others.    \n\nOur server, Alex, was funny, fun, and did a great job of staggering our rolls with the chefs so that we had an endless flow of sushi for a good hour and a half.  When we ordered j in my mouth, he told us his name was Jay, and I'm totally gullible...so when I called for Jay we all got a good laugh when he told us his real name.  With our sushi, he also brought us some of their special house sauces they've come up with.  Most of their sauces are for the teppan bar,  he said, but they are expanding into sushi condiments.\n\nOh yeah, and the sushi was GREAT!  My favorite by far was Da Bomb....with a nice thick slice of fresh jalepeno and lots of spicy tuna in every piece, you can't go wrong.  Everything looked very fresh, was beautifully presented, and tasted great.  Their prices are great for all the specialty rolls they offer, and I can't wait to go back again to try their hot entrees out.\n\nCourse, I'll probably end up gorging myself on sushi again...."

My food was cooked and played with at our teppan station by our beloved chef! Each moresel of food was exquisite! And even better with the sauces that were presented to us.\n\nThere were a plethora of sauces and I had a hard time keeping track. Each one was delicious and unique, so I can't really give you tips on which one to go for. \n\nAll Teppan entrees served with miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, and assorted vegetables. We had a lot of fun with the shrimp appetizer! Chef Tsutomu made shrimp bunnies!\n\nWe also tried the lobster fried rice, which was also very tasty!\n\nAs for dessert, I highly recommend the tempura ice cream. Yes, tempura battered and fried vanilla ice cream! And it is just as great as it sounds. :)\n\n..and it's not just the food that makes this place great!\n\nChef Tsutomu is such a ham. He's hilarious and good at what he does. He is both an expert cook AND an exciting entertainer. If you're thinking about dining at Musashi, request Chef Tsutomu! You definitely won't regret it!!!"

Made a great show with fire and sauces. We could also hear the table behind us was loud and having fun. \nSadly, the chef was highly offended because I took my phone out. At that point he stopped making the entertaining efforts and just cooked. This didn't take away from us paying a full priced meal. They still charged us over $100 for our \"experience\". \nI will give a star for the efforts he started with, two for the waiter, and three for the sauces, steak and seafood.\n The steak and seafood seemed of good quality and cooked adequately. Though they weren't necessarily flavorful or nicely seasoned; but therefore the sauces. \nI am a huge rice lover... I found the rice completely tasteless and if I may, burnt and non appealing. \nFor all the hype I have heard about this place, I expected a bit more. \nIt felt dated, almost a bit dirty (Im no health inspector but check out the hoods), and not welcoming. \nNeedless to say, it may be disrespectful to many to use the phone at the table- which I totally understand and can relate. However, In this case, I feel it was inappropriate for the chef to take this incident personally.\nHe had no idea how important or how\nMeaningful it was for me- not only to respond to the incoming texts or the fact that I wanted to treat my children to a great dining experience While in Vegas. \n\nGood luck to them- we will not be returning."

Therefore, i do my best to eat teppan when i find someplace new, and I found mushashi through Yelp on a birthday trip to vegas a couple of weeks ago.\n\nMy wife and I made reservations for 5pm because we were going to the 7pm Phantom at Venetian and we wanted to give ourselves plenty of time to eat and drink before we headed to the show.  When we got there, we found the place empty, they had just opened up so we were the first customers there (note: by the time we left there were about 10 others) but they were very nice about only having 2 ppl at a huge teppan table.  We sat down and my wife ordered the rib eye and i got the seafood special w/ calamari, lobster, shrimp, etc.  The food was perfectly cooked and was  much better quality than i've had at other teppan places.  I'm not that into the show but that was better than any other place i've been to as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for good teppan w/ good quality food then this is the place.  service was great and the food was even better."

I did my research and asked a friend for a teppanyaki recommendation and apparently this was the place to go to. \n\nUpon arriving I had made reservations earlier today for 6:30 dinner. The lady who picked up the phone wasn't very professional, but I was able to reserve a table. By the time we had arrived no one was present at the front to welcome us to the restaurant. We had to stand by the counter waiting for someone to seat us. After a staff member finally greeted us, we told her about our reservations. She had to check if there was an open table by the kitchen after we were told through the phone that there was one available for us. She then said \"sorry your table was stolen.\" We were hoping to receive maybe a discount on our order or perhaps receive free dessert for the inconvenience, but she just told us to sit anywhere and didn't even walk us to our table. \n\nAfter that rough greeting to our first time at Musashi we finally had our orders taken and we were a bummed that we couldn't have teppanyaki tonight. So we ended up ordering rolls and to our surprise they were very tasty. My personal favorite was the Party N Ur Mouth. It was a roll with deep fried banana, tuna, crab, and sweet mayo. I thought it was unusual at first but we ordered it anyway. And boy was it delicious! We had also ordered the rainbow roll and the porn star. \n\nAlthough we had received poor customer service, we surely enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back to try their teppanyaki. And maybe for more of that Party N Ur Mouth."

The tempura appetizer was good in that it was prepared well and used the correct batter, but it was a touch on the small size. The rolls themselves were mostly junk, though, with yet another place trying to play hide and seek with flavor by utilizing and relying on sauces. I don't recall all the ones that we had, but none of them were anything special. Price was excessive on a couple of the ones were ordered were this in an area not Vegas, but was quite reasonable for Vegas. Ambiance and wait staff were also good. I probably would not return, as I think there's much better to be had and would much prefer to try every other sushi place without a 50% or AYCE sign in the window first.  My suspicion is you're better sticking to the actual cooked food at this place."

First I recommend making reservations and to request Chef/Owner Tsutomu aka Tiger. The chef  is well experienced and will entertain you with his artistic and culinary skills.\n \nThe location of restaurant is not well marked if you are traveling north on Paradise. It is in a strip mall and the front of the building does not face Paradise. Watch for the cross street Corporate Drive. A tip -  it is across the street from Del Frisco's. \nThe restaurant has a colorful Asian flare. The Teppanyaki dining area is separate from the room with regular dining tables. The service staff is very attentive and continues to watch over the table. Teppanyaki dining at Musashi with Chef Tsutomu is like going to the theater. Be prepared to be wowed for 2 hours.\nDinner begins with a small garden salad followed by Miso Soup. The soup was very tasty and flavored with mushrooms and scallions. While you you are enjoying salad and soup the chef is busy preparing the sauces which a too many to remember. But he will provide suggestions for the food paring.\nThe appetizers ordered were edamame and shrimp tempura. The Shishito Peppers which are seasonal were not available this night. \nOur group ordered a variety of entrees that included New York strip streak, shrimp, scallops, and chicken. But before the entrees the chef prepared the vegetables and fried rice.\nAll of the items were cooked to perfection as ordered. It's a credit to the chefs experience to keep track how each person ordered the degree of doneness and level of seasoning. \nIn my opinion the best were the scallops. They were as tender and fresh as can be expected.\nA great beer paring is a large bottle of Sapporo.\nThe finale was the complementary birthday cakes complete with candle.\nKudos to Chef Tsutomu for a fantastic dining experience."

My bf and I were lucky enough to get the owner as our chef.  He was fantastic!  He was entertaining without being cheesy.  He did the requisite tricks but also a few new ones.  He also made some phenomenal sauces which I had never had at other Japanese steakhouses.  I had the scallops - they were cooked perfectly and melted like butter in my mouth.  The bf had the ribeye and lobster tail.  He loved it!  If you ever want teppanyaki when you're in Vegas, head to Musashi!!"

Our table had three separate parties and the head chef was BOOKED. At nearly midnight!\n\nI ordered the steak and scallop combo. Broke da mouth! Although the steak was tender and cooked just the way I wanted it (medium rare), the highlight of dinner were the SCALLOPS. The scallops were perfectly cooked - caramelized and golden brown pan-fried on the outside with a soft, juicy center. The two dipping sauces were also quite good as well as the fried rice. \n\nMany thanks to our amazing chef, who happened to be the nephew of the head chef, for a delightful, fun and entertaining dinner experience. He was very skilled and better than any of the other teppanyaki chefs I've encountered so far in terms of throwing techniques/tricks and cooking. He was a good conversationalist and made us feel welcome in the restaurant. Not only our chef, but also the other restaurant staff were attentive and friendly. We always had full glasses of water and were checked on several times throughout dinner service.\n\nHighly recommended for dinner. Make reservations ahead of time if you want the head chef. \n\n5 stars!"

He knew how to entertain the crowd, and not keep the noise at a silence.  Even though most of his jokes did have a dirty connotation to it, I thought he was a character.  The prices are a little high, but for a group of five we paid a little over $150.00 (not including tip).  \n\nTepanyaki allows the chef to cook your food right in front of you, while putting a show.  (Well, I think that's what it is to my understanding)  This place gives you a vast array of dipping sauces for your food.  My personal favorite is the yum-yum sauce, and the lemon garlic butter would be the second.  I did wish they cooked the food all at once, because you wait for rice, veggies, then meats to be cooked and then you can eat.  It's like a long wait cause he puts a show with it.  The fried rice is good, I've had better but it does compliment the food you eat.  The chef even gives you choice of either adding spice, or no spice.  I ordered the Musashi special, which was like $58.00.  It came with prawns, shrimp, lobster tail, steak and one dessert.  The steak came out really tender, and the shrimp had an amazing flavor with the yum-yum sauce.  And the lobster tail tasted off the hook with the garlic butter lemon sauce.  The veggies were mediocre, but the green tea ice cream did settle everything down in my stomach.  The flavors are such a variety, you wouldn't know what hit you.  \n\nIf you do come here, try to sit with Tony.  He's a character, and he keeps you entertained throughout the whole night."

That is our \"normal\" dinner time and just so happens to be the time of their happy hour. ( we eat teppanyaki, he occasionally gets sushi but it isn't anything super great maybe 3.5 stars for sushi )  You can get full entree stuff for lunch prices in addition to sushi and drink specials. We have experienced shitty service from the wait staff before and other times its beyond excellent. We don't come here for the wait staff though. \n\nFOOD:::: \nThe food is a bit above average but what really makes this place is the amazing side sauces. ( request garlic butter, yum yum, & spicy yum yum for starters ) The chefs are mostly all good besides this white guy we had one time but haven't seen him again. As a frequent customer I do notice preferential treatment and nicer staff. I wouldn't say customers as new combers get poor treatment by any means... just normal.. but as frequent customers we get a little special attention. I would highly recommend coming here..\n\nHOURS, STAFF, & POKER::: \n In June and July when the world series of poker is happening this place often stays open till 4 or 5 am... but that doesn't happen all the time.. tonight were here and they barely let the last couple in at 2:55. It isn't unusual for them to close early if they are slow. Just call first if you are concerned. Also, if you are unhappy I highly recommend you request Tiger ( the owner, but not on football days/nights :) ) and say \"Hey, last time it wasn't that great, can you make it up for me?\" and he will be sure to get you back on track. The other chefs are great too but like I said if you didn't like it last time you should ask for the owner. We didn't like some guys at first but learned to request certain things certain ways if needed that really amped up our experience. Don't be afraid to ask for something special in a special way. \n\nATMOSPHERE::: \nSome of the chef's can be very over the top with x-rated type stuff.. but we almost always sit with locals or people who frequent the place so I'm not sure if that is filtered out at other times.. the chef's appear to work off the mood. \n\nPRICE:: \n\nHappy Hour Teppan - $ 17 steak and shrimp includes fried rice\nNon happy hour teppan - $29 steak and shrimp plus $3.50 for fried rice"

In fact, it was the Kobe beef that saved it from a 2-star rating.

EVERRRRRRR!!!\n\ni've been to so many teppan places in hawaiii---kobe steakhouse, tanaka of tokyo, benihana; none of them can even come close to my time at musashi.  not only was the chef super entertaining, but the food was SOOOOOO good.  \n\ni'll start with the chef---his name is tsutomu.  SO entertaining, SO hilarious, SO fast with that knife and two prong fork, did i mention SO entertaining?  i seriously had the teppan time of my life.  i don't think i've ever had a chef that made me laugh so much and dub me a new name (mercedes).  AND told a (dirty) story about rabbits using the shrimp.  AAAAND busted out so many kinky knick-knacks and toys.  it is definitely recommended that you ask for him.\n\nnow, the food---i felt like i got so much more food at this place than any other.  and so many different sauces too!  i swear there were at least 8 different ones.  garlic, spicy, sweet, ginger, mustard, aioli, etc.  i was so amazed!  my favorite has got to be the garlic one since i LOVE garlic.  i also enjoyed the fact that strips of potato were included in the meal.  i think i liked that the most.  i ordered the katana special which consisted of chicken and shrimp.  sooooo yummy.  i also had a bite of my friend's steak which he drizzled with lime (something i had never seen).  surprisingly, it was really tasty!  i ate a little bit of the lobster fried rice too and as much as i don't care for lobster, it was pretty effin great.  but of course, my faaaaaave was the dessert.  tempura ice cream! need i say more???\n\nthe next time i go back to vegas, i'm def hitting up musashi and tsutomu again!!! :)\n\np.s. their sushi is pretty good too! try it!\np.p.s. service is awesome too"

He then proceeded to cook our food but not until he showed his mastery of the cutlery by tossing his knives, forks, and spatulas around with prowess of a ninja.  This went on throughout the preparation of our dinners.  He also made lots of different sauces on the grill that he used to spice our rice, meat, and veggies. \n\nThe various meats were cooked to order and were also spiced or flavored as requested.  We all left the place with smiles on our faces and full bellies. \n\nWe didn't have reservations but they were able to squeeze us in. So reservations are highly recommended.

The sashimi was good but not good to a point that was impressive, but the sashimi salad was HUGE and OMG! The best sashimi salad I ever had.. I love the way the marinated it in spicy sauce (for spicy food lovers) and the lettuce was so fresh that it tasted very well along with the sashimi and seaweeds.. \n\nThe servers were very attentive and made my experience at Musashi much more pleasant :-) \n\nI will definitely come back again for the Sashimi salad and their happy hour hot sake and beers! xoxo"

From start to end, this place had delicious food, friendly wait staff, intriguing atmosphere, and everything else you could possibly ask for in a great restaurant.\n\nAs we all trickled into the restaurant, we ordered drinks and a few sushi rolls from the bar. The sushi chef was excellent, and a true artist. Every roll that was presented looked absolutely stunning and delicious. Believe me, they didn't just look delicious, they knocked your socks off in flavor. Unanimously, the \"Grand Finale\" roll(refer to pic) killed the competition. So delicious!\n\nAfter a few minutes, we were sat at our table. We placed our orders, and were all able to order from the happy hour menu which starts at 12am and ends at 3am. Everybody was ordering hot sake, and Asahi beers(both were under happy hour). We also ordered a few bottles of their chilled Junmi Sake(refer to pic) which everybody, even the non-sake drinkers, thoroughly enjoyed.  As soon as our Chef, Chef Nick, came out from behind the japanese curtains separating the kitchen and dining room, he was the best entertainment since Leo Gallagher and his famous sledgehammer. He was truly HILARIOUS, entertaining, and artistic. The Teppanyaki was everything and more, than what I could have ever imagined. \n\nThis restaurant experience was a one of the best I have ever had. When you have the pleasure of dining with close friends/co-workers, and feel as though you made more friends after leaving then when you arrived, its simply incredible. Thank you to not only Chef Nick, but all the staff at Musashi for an amazing night out!"

When I first went, I got lucky enough to get Tiger, and it was the best teppanyaki experience I've ever had.  And I've been to  A LOT of teppanyaki places.  My friends wanted to get something quick, and I had to convince them to go there.  Afterwards, everyone was extremely pleased. When I went there a second time, I got another chef, and the experience was average at best. \n\nI was surprised that there was such a large disparity in terms of the experience because every other teppanyaki place I've been to has had consistency amongst the chefs. In other words, you can go multiple times and get different chefs, yet the food and overall experience will be extremely similar.\n\nWhen we were seated on my second visit, Tiger was cooking at another table.  It seemed as if he had been going for a while.  When our chef was done, Tiger was still cooking.  He takes his time and the product reflects this. He also spends a long time making fantastic sauces.  My chef only used the generic sauces from the bottle. Not to say that he was bad - the food was still good.  But I was surprised that the overall product would be so different between the chefs.  So definitely request Tiger. And hopefully he'll start training the other chefs to make a product similar to the outstanding quality of his"

During and after we were finished eating though it took forever for our waters to be filled and our server disappeared and turned into a hispanic man.

We had a 7:30pm arrived early at 7pm had to wait for the next group to arrive before they started, about 40 min later we started our experience which i was excited about. Since the food channel stated the sauce is what makes them so special. WHAT SAUCE? The only sauce i got was after i finish all my meat and shrimp which was a teriyaki sauce, the cook say put the sauce on the rice. I was thining WTF, i have no more food and rice. Anyway just a bad experience overall, chef was busy talking to a regualr with kids taking up most of his attention and we felt ignored. He was a nice Korean guy, friendly however we felt disconnected from the overall experience. Better to just go with with Benihanna if we are going to do that. No go for me in the future, food was average and service was average. I still gave a 20% tip since it was labor intensive.\n\n\nP.S also when i went to restroom passing by the other grilling table that crowd was having a blast and they had so many different sauces on their table, The chef is from Hawaii and was doing a great job for the other table. Anyway its just a bummer when you expect more than what you actually get.\n\nOh and the chef was still talking to the regular person with the group outside the parking lot, when we left. It must have been long awaited."

After he sat us down, mind you we were seated in the booth right behind his desk, we waited for almost 10mins for a waiter and the place wasn't even packed or busy. Approximately 8mins into our waiting, I noticed two male waiters approached the front desk and they began to converse with the Asian guy. The three of them could see us sitting there waiting and not one of them bothered to assist us. Also mind you, we still have not been served drinks at the very least. I looked at my daughter and said, \"if no one comes to this table within 2mins, we are leaving.\" Sure enough, 2mins later the front desk guy walked out the front door to have a cigarette, so we walked out. As we walked out, he turned, saw us, and said nothing! Talk about piss poor service. This establishment does not deserve good paying patrons like us. NEVER will we return. There are thousands of competing Japanese restaurants so you'd think they would be on their A game...obviously not! Stay away from this place if you're hangry.

He had the animal print chef hat, so maybe if you ask for him you'll have a better experience. \nThe food was good and, like other reviews have mentioned, about 8 sauces are made throughout the dinner, with many really tasty ones.

Meats were all tender (filet mignon melted in my mouth, but the NY steaks were pretty good too), very well seasoned, and the multitudes of sauce were all delicious. A little disappointed with their 'hot' sauce. It was good and probably my second favorite after the garlic one, but it couldn't pass for mild at an Asian restaurant. I ordered the plain ole steamed rice instead of friend rice like everyone else because most teppan places just give you some butter+soy sauce rice with some veggies tossed in. I think the chef forgot and just made all the rice into fried rice, so he just gave me and my friend some, and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWe didn't get the main chef, so our show wasn't as impressive.  He tried some tricks, but he occasionally slipped up. He generally made up for with the conversation we had, until he got going with the regular at the table and the conversation steered toward strip clubs and pot.

I was a little nervous about this place because I knew it was small and off the strip so sometimes you never know what you will get.  There isn't much curb appeal with this place, it's in a small strip mall, but don't judge the book by it's cover.  The inside of the restaurant was clean and dimly lit.  They have 2 huge grill tables on one side of the restaurant that seat about 16 people at each.  \n\nJust about everyone in the group ordered either the filet or the \"musashi special\" and everyone in our party would give the food at least a 5 star rating.  The homemade sauces were all excellent.  I'm still trying to figure out what some of them were, but they were all delicious.  The chef did a good job of explaining them as he was making them but i'm pretty sure i was already half in the bag from the numerous bottles of wine we had.  \n\nFunny thing is, a few weeks after we came back from Vegas, this place was on \"Steak Paradise\" on the travel channel and our server was the one featured on the show.  I can't remember his name but he was awesome!  I don't think i stopped laughing for more than a few minutes during the meal, other than to stuff some delicious lobster, steak, prawns, or scallops in my mouth.  The food was to die for.  \n\nIt was a little pricey, but everything in vegas is.  The food was definitely worth it and the entertaining show put on by the chef made the evening unforgettable.

I actually first looked up on citysearch to only discover that there were only very few places in Vegas that  served shabu-shabu. So I read my reviews and compared the ratings. ( I base my judgement on the majority of positive votes and also making sure the reviews stood on genuine and honest answers, since I tend to stray away from overly opinionated reviews where I feel that it almost leans on a more negative and very personal scale ) So i came across Musashi ..and I said \"why not\". \n\nSo read the menu and their specials which goes during certain times of the day and since it was early I would be able to make it to the lunch menu. I was totally convinced and gung-ho about my shabu-shabu all until i finished reading the menu.  which i found pretty impressive because it was very extensive. So I ended up changing my mind and went for the teppanyaki menu instead.\nSo I arrive there and I am seated to the teppanyaki table, and there was already a party group seated, mind you I am alone and the chef greets everyone and is very friendly. The people actually at the table were pretty friendly too and happened to be local regulars also.\n I order the New york steak well done with shrimp ( $17 ) that includes your soup, fried rice and veggies.. and that offer goes until 3 p.m.  As the chef cooks he was very entertaining and his stories were just as entertaining also, just the way I like it. =)  He kept making and suggesting all these different sauces to go with your meals and I tell you they were so so sooo good.  In the end there were about 7 different sauces to go with my food. My favorite one was the sesame with lemon..it was fantastic! The steak came out tender and just-right, the fried rice was amazing and balanced, the shrimp was wonderful, the veggies weren't overcooked, I enjoyed every bite and morsel, all and in between the variations of sauces. I ate up every single thing on my plate.  What also  made it such a great experience for my first time visit was that there were many laughs shared. The chef and the party made me feel comfortable too. Its always nice to know there are genuine people out there and especially when they are grouped together. I had such a wonderful and great experience with the staff, the customers, and my food.. So of course, with my research, I pat myself on the back cause I've done my homework well and by also completing a very satisfied appetite. I am definitely going back and trying other things on the menu. This time I'm bringing in my husband and our friends. Spreading the word about this wonderful place.  * Very satisfied customer indeed * yay! =)"

I know better, but I never learn.  I am always sad for the fried rice with yum yum sauce that stays behind.  Each time when I give myself the pre Musashi pep talk, I promise myself things like, \"I won't eat the vegetables\"  and \"I'll let my husband have the  shrimp appetizer.\"  But, it turns out, I'm a liar.  The veggies are as tasty as the rest.  Now, let's talk about sauces.  I am a lady who enjoys condiments, on everything.  Musashi gets me, there are so many different freshly made sauces each bite of each course is an experience.  I have considered asking for a straw, but I would be distraught if they decided to never let me in again.  The last time, I was in Vegas I figured it all out though.  Musashi two nights in a row.  If you're going to spend $50+ per person for dinner, your might as well ensure you are getting  quality food and entertainment.  \n\nIn summary, if you like good food and dirty jokes and a break from the strip Musashi will blow your mind."

We had Chef Octavio. He made amazing sauces for our lobster, shrimp, ribeye, filet etc. Garlic sauce, lemon butter, teriyaki... We were stuffed.  Great price for what you get."

Our chef was great! He put on a very entertaining show, and he prepared the food wonderfully. He also prepared about 5 or 6 dipping sauces for various parts of the entree. The meal was a tad more expensive than similar places I've been, but I feel like I got my money's worth. This is one of the best Japanese restaurant experiences I've had. They're also open late. If you're in Vegas and looking for an entertaining outing, and great tasting food, check this place out."

            "review": "The low down is this place has excellent sushi for a reasonable price and the late night menu is greatest draw with its long hours and half off prices. Read on if you want to know more...\n\nTHIS IS THE REVIEW YOU WANT TO READ!! First let me start by saying that this place and Ichiza are my 2 favorite sushi places in town and this review is worth the read if your planning on getting sushi here. I have eaten here countless times for late night sushi over the last year usually 1-2 times a week. They have amazing prices for their late night menu which is active from 11pm till 4am EVERYDAY! I go here for the happy hour plain and simple. I have never tried the teppanyaki side of the place. I have been when the place is busy and over half full and I have been when I was the only group there. In my many visits I have had a few long waits for food and check but they have been few and far between. Just like any other place they can get busy or be understaffed and its easy to forget that they also have to serve the teppanyaki side of the restaurant which can sometimes lead to waiting. The service has always been good and I have never had a rude server for any of my visits. The sushi chef's here are very consistent and it is always enjoyable. Once again like any other place it can have its off days with the sushi as well. I am pleased to report that 95% of the time I greatly enjoy the sushi and the 5% that I did not greatly enjoy the sushi it is still good and well worth the price. As I have said the late night menu is excellent for the price which I will now explain further to give you a grasp of the bill you should expect. The happy hour menu is loosely half off all items listed (this is to say a $7 roll might be $3.50 or it may be $4). If you like sushi as much as I do then you can leave like a overstuffed thanksgiving turkey with a very decent variety or rolls and appetizers for about $20 a person. The late night menu has roughly 30 food items on it with the majority priced under $5 per order. The sushi chef's here are willing to make what you want almost anyway you want it. If a roll you like isn't on the menu ask about it and if they can make it then will! If you want a roll fried just ask and chances are they will fry it for you. Overall the place is great and I love it there. I would recommend it to any friend with the same word I have written here.\n\nMy happy hour order consistently contains the following rolls and I suggest them to if you don't know what you want. The Ninja roll is my all time favorite (spicy tuna roll that has been breaded and fried). The regular Spicy Tuna roll is always great. For the fans of not spicy things the Christian roll and Washington rolls are excellent choice! If your looking for something that will have you think \"Refreshing\" order the Alaskan roll.\n\nThank you for reading my review over and if you try this place out I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"

Which is (if you haven't seen it) is totally worth the asking price. The chiefs there are an amazing bunch of guys. Talented, friendly and even funny. All while making food look so easy and effortless. This place is a place for people who would love to see the process of how food is made right in front of them with a little \"pazzase.\" ON TOP OF THAT the food is to die for. Chicken and steak is my all time favorite there. Also this place is open late! That alone is perfect for the late night eater with a appetite. Go and check this place out. YOU MIGHT AS WELL!\n\nCheck this place out for a more entertaining food experience."

            "review": "I can tell you this one first thing about Musashi.  The absolute best roll of sushi I remember having in all my years of sushi nom'dom was served to me from Musashi.  I believe it to be a dragon roll type variation at the time and it was prepared by a latin chef.  It may have just been right time right place right company, but my girl also still remembers just how much that one stood out.  It was a second first date of sorts, soo..\n\nAside from that roll.  The teppanyaki chefs are the most comical and animated here.  This being a spot that my single years most frequented I can vouch that the chefs are truly charismatic and their chef skills are a cut above.  Top notch teppanyaki.  The squid cake is tender.  The rib-eye is to die for.  *Make sure you tell the chef that you like the fat!!!* they will double grill the fat in a special sweet crunchy way and your tongue will remember it more than your first real kiss.  \n\nThe teppan menus range from traditional price ranges and make sure to dish out for the Musashi special or the Tsutomu if you are pesceterian like me.  Since it is a shared table, when the chef is done with everyone elses meats then he continues to pull out additional entree's for your upper tier special you will immediately see the faces of envy upon your fellow diners!  Mwahaha!\n\nMake sure to drop a few Sake bombs down your Hiroshima to make the mood perfect.  Traditional kimono adorned waitresses will attend to your buzz for the night and I can't stress how much fun you can have at Musashi may usually equate to a taxi cab or recommended designated driver.  The night is young, or it may not be.  They do open quite late to satisfy Vegas' party people which is also another plus.\n\nI will have to admit that I haven't seen that young latin phantom chef since.  The one that cut and rolled the most prodigious piece of delectable sushi I have or may possibly ever have had in my young adult life.  However I may keep coming back to Musashi my entire lifetime.  Enjoying all the other good things that they offer, and give a glance back to the sushi counter in hopes to demystify the fabled sushi shogun."

            "review": "I was hungry for some japanese food and the reviews was fairly good and their website boasted some good hype so i decided to give it a try.  being a chef myself i was looking forward to my dinner.  \nWhen i arrived the waiter tried to give me a seat at the sushi bar, which i did not want to sit at.  So I asked for a table and i was given a look of disgust.  (First Stike)...  The server then dropped 3 menus on the table with a thunderous thump.  (Strike 2)...  A different server then came and asked if he could get something to drink in which i replied yes i got some water since it was really hot that day.  then it took me almost 20 minutes just to look over the menu.  I was in the mood for some sashimi combo but was not offered for dinner, so I ordered steamed gyoza and fried agedashi tofu for my app.  and a unagi bowl for my main course.  i waited about 20 minutes and the waiter brings me my unagi bowl which i ordered for my main course.  I asked the waiter that should I not get my apps before I get my main course.  He then replied that its being cooked now, but the unagi bowl comes from the sushi bar.  I politely told him that it shouldn't matter where it comes from I would like to get my food accordingly.  The waiter then asked me if he should take the unagi bowl back and bring it back after I am done with the apps.  I said yes please.  \nAfter another 15 minutes passed and I finally get my steamed gyoza potstickers which was a dissapointment where i can tell it was a store bought frozen potsticker and it wasnt even cooked right.  It was mush and i just had 1 bite of that and that was enough for me.  then came the fried tofu which was salty and it was as if no one took any care in preparing that dish.  In total it took 35 minutes to cook frozen potstickers out of a bag and to deep fry some tofu. ( unacceptable)...  The waiter then brings back a cold unagi bowl which was just left out waiting for me to finish my apps...  to top it off the rice was sushi rice.  I never had a bowl with sushi rice before  and that was the last straw...  I put my chopsticks down and asked for the check.  The waiter just said thank you and gave me my check.  He did not one time ask me why I haven't touched any of my food except for 1 bite each dish.  I gave the waiter my money and ask to speak to the manager or owner.  Like I said being a restaurant owner and a chef my self I wanted to have a civilized conversation regarding this matter and to see what kind of operation they are running.  The Server escorted me to the owner who was working as the cashier as well.  I told her straight out that her food was terrible.  She just Said \"Oh! That's Ok I will take care of your bill\" and gave me my money back.  I started to express to her what was wrong with everything and she would have non of that.  she just kept saying \" It's ok , It's ok\"...  It just showed me that maybe in the beginning of the restaurant she and her husband started with a bang.  But now they run the restaurant without any care what so ever.  My opinion is if they don't want to be in business then they should quit and stop lying to everyone about their food and service.  If the owners dont care then the server and the cooks don't care either and it shows.  \n\nIF ANYONE IS READING THIS REVIEW I HIGHLY RECOMMENT THAT YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.. UNLESS YOU LIKE BAD SERVICE AND FOOD.."

All the tepenyaki chefs are welcoming and have a great energy, making your meal more enjoyable. Young is the best, in my opinion, so if you can get him, you're golden. \n\nThe place is always packed when I go which is a double edged sword. On one hand, it shows that they are a great restaurant with a lot of loyal customers. on the other hand - sometimes it's too busy for me to get seated right away. \n\nTepenyaki - for those who don't know - is where they seat you around a grill, and the chef cooks your food right in front of you. At Musashi - with your tepenyaki meal, you get fried rice, vegetables, your meat choice, as well as soup. Each chef also makes their own unique sauces to accompany the meal. It's a great value, and the best place to get tepenyaki in Vegas. \n\nI almost didn't want to write a review on this place, because I want to keep it all to myself. But, alas, one can't be greedy when it comes to sharing great places to eat. Eat here, and you won't regret it. \n\nHighly recommended !!!"

Got two bowls of rice turned upside down with some round veggie on top and they called it boobs... great... I paid 20% more over Benihana for rice boobs?  The food was okay, so I'll give it another shot.\n\nSecond and final visit.\n\n- 6 weeks out:  Made reservations for adult show for 7 at 10pm.\n\n- 3 weeks out:  Called to confirm reservation for adult show for 7 at 10pm. Confirmed.\n\n- Reservation:  Showed up 15 minutes before and checked in with the hostess, confirmed that we had reservation for 7 and for adult show.  She tells us to tell the server you want adult show.  She then proceeds to sit a party of 3 at our table... they had a 9 year old with them.  While most 9 year old nowadays have probably seen more internet porn than most adults my age, I did the adult thing and let the hostess know that she just sat a kid at the adult show table.  Apparently, according to the hostess, a 9 year old seeing a 2 foot long big black dildo with simulated jiz is, to her, perfectly fine.  I continued to ask for an kid free adult show.  After asking for the manager, I was told that she was not at the restaurant.  After further pressing, we asked to speak with the owner Tsutomu (AKA Tiger)... we explained our situation, about making reservations and blah blah blah... he couldn't give two shits.  Taking the high road, we decided to leave and not scar the poor kid.\n\nThis is what I get from wanting to see a big black dildo at a Japanese restaurant.\n\nIt is now my mission in life to divert any and all tourist away from this shitty place."

So let me give this review as best as I can remember.  There were 13 of us and there was no problem in fitting all of us in at one grill which was awesome. We got started off with some great sake bombs, we kinda  went nuts and bought the way expensive sake bottle at 120 a piece but they have an ok selection if you don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. Any ways the sake bombs were delicious not to mention we had a waiter there that kept bringing out all these crazy shot's he had concocted. This all happened before the food. \n\nOur chef came out and he was great, I love teppanyaki places it is like art meets great food. Not only was he amazing at whipping his knives around he was freaking HILARIOUS! I got steak lobster and scallops which were all very good. The fried rice they make right on the grill was great too. All in all this place was a great place for a big party to let loose and eat really good food at the same time. Def going back!"

I am not really a fun of red painted walls especially for Japanese restaurant.\nWe ordered variety of sushi rolls from traditional ones to American born ones.

If I win the World Series I definintely will be coming in for some kobe and sashimi!\n\nI remember going to a lot of benihana's (in Las Vegas, and San Diego) and usually they  have Hispanic Chefs. I am not saying that Hispanic chefs suck, but the Japanese teppan chef really add an interesting personality that enhances their Japanese cuisine!\n\nThis place has a good lunch teppan menu, and happy hour. But everything they make is perfect. They make a steak miso soup, perfect teppan friend rice, and the ambiance is great. It is is the same strip mall as a lot of great choice dinning options, but if I were in the mood for steak and lobster, I would choose here over Ruth's Chris anyday."

The place was empty, but they assured us they were still open. More people started coming in after us, so I guess we just bring the party with us.\n\nTheir selection is outstanding, with many items you rarely find at your standard Japanese restaurant. Lots of X-rated rolls such as Sex on the Beach, WTF, and J in My Mouth. It can take a while to decide, so if you're with a group, just get a bunch of items and do it family style. \n\nIf you're never had Okonomiyaki, this would be an optimal place to try it. I was a Japanese pizza virgin before this, and I am very glad to have popped my cherry. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake served with noodles, veggies, sweet sauce, seaweed, various spices and your choice of meat. It's an intense myriad of flavors that balance each other out. A mildly sweet and savory combo on a heavy, but fluffy and delicious batter. It's plenty for one person and goes great with a bottle of beer.\n\nSpeaking of beer, Sapporo is $8. That's as much as my meal. Big letdown.\n\nService was slow, despite us initially being the only ones in the restaurant. We were told okonomiyaki would take 15-20 min, but it took at least 35. We weren't in a hurry but no one enjoys waiting. \n\nOverall, its a great place if you're craving Japanese, but something out of the ordinary sushi/bento box deal."

But, we are both so glad we did stop by.\n\nWe came around 10:30 on a Thursday night; the front part of the restaurant was packed, but the teppanyaki part was completely  empty. We were seated right away, and was told the chef would start in a few minutes. \n\nAnother party arrived, and Chef Jason came out. Now, Jason was probably the best part of the entire experience. He was friendly and offered such great service. We had to personally tip him $30 in the end (that's how great he was!) My boyfriend is a sauce person, and Jason made so many delicious sauces that definitely added to the steak and seafood that we ordered.\n\nSome of the reviews mentioned not eating all the fried rice at the beginning of the meal, and it's so true! The rice was so delicious that I managed to finish it all... Before he started cooking anything else. Learned my lesson, because I was so full to fully enjoy the steak, shrimp, lobster tail, and vegetables. He cooked both steaks to a perfect medium rare and the lobster tail was drenched deliciously in a creamy sauce. \n\nWe're returning in August to celebrate my 21st birthday, and I definitely will be asking for Jason again."

I liked the chefs - albeit, one was a bit randy (probably used to that being the norm for some guests) - and the meals were really quite tasty!  It's in a very unassuming mall, so look quick!  Right now, it's next to a Mongolian place we haven't tried, so that's your marker to look for.  Strongly recommend you try this!  They can accomodate up to 18 in one sitting (I know, because we were 16 of them!).  And they can take 2 if there's room at someone else's table.  Really nice."

We visited this place many moons ago and I am now just getting around to writing a review so here it is the best I remember it. \n\nMe and my wife saw this place featured on the travel channel. We were in town for our buddys 40th bday party. We lugged everyone a short drive off the strip into a crowded strip mall deal. We walk into to a relatively empty Musashi. This place to my remembrance only has 2 hibachi tables and some a considerable amount of regular tables. If making reservations one must declare that one wants a hibachi presentation. \n\nDue to one of the chefs calling in, there was a considerable wait to get our chef. This actually turned out to be a good thing because little did we know we would be getting the owner and the chef featured on the travel channel. We were nice and toasty by the time he got there off sapporo's and sake. The chef/owner introduces himself and immediately begins with jokes and most of the jokes were not of child nature. He picked one person from our group and playfully made fun of her the whole time like a comedian would to our amusement. The display this guy put on was phenomenal and this is coming from a Hibachi Veteran Pro. None of the tricks he displayed had I seen before. He had a cast iron rice former made out of the design of genetials, something you would have to see to believe.\n\nI ordered the Kobe beef, I had never had it before. Needless to say it was \"market price\" and not cheap by any means but I didn't care. The mushroom soup was standard and good. The rice was the BEST I ever had. The SAUCE was absolutely amazing and blows away every sauce I have ever had.  When I got the kobe beef I let everyone at the table have a piece. Kobe beef is very fatty, very tasty and delectable as all HELL.\n\nOverall one of the best places I have eaten in my life thus earining my first 5 star rating and I am no stranger to nice restaraunts.\n\nIf you find yourself in vegas and in the mood for this type of food do yourself a favor and skip the Hiltons Beni hana and take a cab ride over to Musashi..son, you will not be dissapoint."

Apparently, this restaurant was featured on the Travel Channel, and is the usual go-to place for performers, poker players, etc. during late hours. The decor is very simple and clean. It's a pretty small place. But here, I guess the food speaks for itself. The chef is very personable and friendly. He has a great sense of humor and mad skills on the grill! The food is cooked on a large tepan grill right in front of you. (Think Benihana.)  My husband and I shared an ahi poki salad and the Teppanyaki Musashi Special which included filet mignon, lobster tail, prawns, and scallops with two sides of fried rice. The filet mignon was grilled perfectly to a medium-rare...very juicy. The lobster tail and prawns were succulent. And I'm usually not a fan of scallops but they were fantastic! Very flavorful and tender. I also really love how the chef chops everything into bite-size pieces before putting it on your plate. He also had so many different secret sauces to compliment each type of food. My absolute favorite was a sweet and tangy pineapple mayo-based sauce that I ate with everything. The food was sooo flavorful and delicious. It also had a slightly charred flavor due to the grill which I really like. I was salivating from beginning until end. (I'm salivating while I'm writing this review.) Mind you, the fried rice...which I didn't expect to be anything special...was phenomenal!! I would come here after a long drunken night just for a bowl of the hearty, buttery fried rice. I've been craving for it ever since.\n\nI know that a lot of people never leave the strip when they visit Vegas, but it's totally worth it if you enjoy great Japanese food and live entertainment while dining. I can't wait to come back!"

I went here based on Yelp reviews with a group of coworkers so I was very happy that it worked out so well. Multiple people said they had never had such good teppanyaki. Ask for Jason! You will love it!"

The chef \"Rico\" was super nice and pleasant to talk to. The cooking performance was pretty  standard  but again, it's all about the food right. We had the NY Steak and Salmon combo. NY steak was tender and the salmon was impressively moist and tasty. We also got a side of Scallops which was awesome. Opt for the Fried rice, taste delicious (but greasy). . Their sushi was just ok so stick with the Teppanyaki. Enjoy this place"

Just go you won't be disappointed and try every chef out. It's more fun that way. I really don't want to pick a favorite chef like most people do because I feel its unnecessary to judge like that. I like that every chef has given us something unique from different sauces to different tricks. But at the end of the day the food is always and I mean always awesome!! Oh the sauces that these guys make are all different. I loved chef youngs sauce though he took the fat from the New York steak and cooked it up for a while and made a sauce for our steak that was really delish!! Forever customer for sure"

Only inconvenience is on holidays, they are super busy and the place will stay booked all night- I think that's the only time we've tasted their food to just be Ok rather than great.   Also since there's a lot of people sitting with one cook we sometimes feel that our food is shared with everybody and we don't get all of it. We've paid attention to see who gets what just to confirm our thoughts and yes, we were right they will share your food with the whole table which sucks because we wish we'd get everything we paid for. Our favorite pick is the Musashi Special which is about $60 per person. Their fried rice is to die for and specially with all their custom sauces.\nWe've also tried their sushi side and were expecting the best just like their Teppan  side but it was just sushi, nothing really special about their rolls, didn't really care for them.  \nThis is must try if you're into Teppan."

The rolls are small, these are done on 1/2 sheets of nori not full sheets so they are very thin.  The price is ok, but you get what you pay for.  If you want cheap sushi  go to all you can eat.  Rolls, and nigiri are very loose.  Tempura rolls are UGLY and expensive...  Change your frying oil, and roll that roll in flour before you fry it.  Again very small roll for $15.00...\n\nWell thanks for making me look bad in front of my beautiful wife....

We had the owner as our cook and he treated us to 6 or 7 different sauces. We had the Musashi special, and it was the bomb!! Tiger (the owner) was not only a great chef, but was a great entertainer. If you want Tepenyaki that is only 1 mile from the strip and easy on the wallet, you'll want to try Musashi. As a local, I rank this place as high as I would Morton's, or Ruth Chris!! The sushi is OK, but the Musashi Special is out of this world!! Nuff-said!!"

So Musashi was a LIFE SAVER. It become a weekly ritual to have my date night here with my boyfriend. The people watching is awesome, the restaurant is divided into two parts, hibachi tables in one room and sushi bar, booths and tables in the other room. I'll take TEPPANYAKI all day, because you can still order sushi rolls from the other room. You'd be surprised who you will run into here, poker players love this place! \n\nIt's not your average dining experience. You'll probably get drunk, laugh a lot  at conversations with random crazy strangers in VEGAS, and have fun playful banter with your chef. \n\nThe food is really why people keep coming back. The experience is a plus but this place is really my 'cheat meal' when I feel like indulging in fresh hibachi. They are always slammed (even in the AM) but they're generally worth the wait. Where else do I have to be at 3 am anyway? It's normally a couple hours by the time we finish our meal. \n\nMy order is standard for these places, the Musashi Special that includes a taste of pretty much everything. Miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail, FRIED RICE and yummy ice cream. It's pricey. About $60 for my meal plus drinks but at night they have saki happy hour. 2 for 1 beer. Shots. Whatever, its great for after a long night out."

From the moment we entered, all I could smell and taste was an overpowering potpourri that reminded me of the cheapest commercial grade bathroom cleaner. As we were leaving, I located the culprit, 2 giant Yankee Candles blazing away. I am not sure why the candles were necessary, but the scent severely undermined my dining experience.\n\nI thought the interior was shabby. I can't explain it, perhaps it all goes back to the scent, but I just got a bad vibe from the surroundings. I requested a wine list, and it had stains. All the little details just added up to a less than amazing impression.\n\nAs for the food, I think the main attraction here is the \"Kobe,\" but I was not in the mood for meat, so I opted for the vegetarian entree, which was surprisingly $2 more than the chicken. It did include tofu, a surprising find. I am sure that the food differs greatly from chef to chef, but everything was overseasoned with white pepper. I can handle a small dash of white pepper, but in large quantities, I do not care for the taste. Every item had a heavy dousing of white pepper, so I did not love anything. The chef did create a series of special sauces with sesame seeds, and they were pretty tasty, but the white pepper flavor was there too! \n\nOur chef was nice, but I am not a fan of sexual innuendos while dining. Call me a prude! Our chef only made the occasional innuendo, but one was directed at me... gross! And, I saw the chef at the adjacent table shape the fried rice into a giant penis and sprinkle \"hair\" on top. This might be hilarious for some people, but I just think it is odd. Yeah, I am that girl that doesn't appreciate penis jokes. However, I accept that some people find them clever.\n\nThis is a generous 3 stars simply because my husband enjoyed his salmon, and our waiter was nice. He brought me a new glass of wine when I thought the first one was spoiled. Plus, the white pepper thing may be a personal preference. There is also the possibility that the sushi is good, and they are open until 4am, which is worth at least one star."

            "review": "I met a friend here who was with a group for a birthday party a couple weeks ago. I showed up after everyone had already put their order in and wanted to start a separate tab. The waiter told me he couldn't make my own tab at first but reluctantly changed his mind. I get it, no one likes having to deal with separate checks, but I only had my credit card and I didn't know the rest of the people in the party. Anyway I placed my order (chicken teriyaki bowl) and shortly after the waiter told our group that we needed to change tables because Floyd Mayweather's entourage needed our table. WTF. Mind you this was a planned birthday dinner and everyone was in the middle of eating! I couldn't believe what was happening! So we all follow their wishes and bring our plates and food over to our new tables without complaining but they didn't even offer anything for having to move in the middle of our dinner! My friend had to mention something to them and I think they finally gave 20% off to the birthday boy but nothing else. So embarassing! My food never came to the new table until I asked a different waiter where it was and by then everyone was already done eating. I understand sometimes venues have to cater to high profile clientele but it should have been handled differently."

I was stuffed and still had enough food on my plate for another meal. The chef was very skilled in his craft and was very entertaining as well. Low key place. Casual environment. \n\nThis restaurant has one entrance and is divided into two parts, sushi and teppanyaki."

            "review": "So it's a pretty standard Japanese Steakhouse. The food was good. I chef was brand new.  The guy at the other table was amazing and I watched him the whole time and then our guy came out and it was obvious he was just learning how.  I felt bad for him because you could tell he felt inadequate but he did a few cool things so hopefully he is learning quickly. \n\nWe had a reservation but they still made us wait about 40 minutes. \n\nI probably would have given 3-4 stars but my wife and I both got really sick after.  I am not sure if this food caused our stomach issues but after evacuating the food we both felt better.  But you know how it is after you feel like the food somewhere made you sick it's difficult to think much of them."

Big John is the best chef adding favors to our food I've never been offered. As you all know Japanese Steakhouses aren't known for a lot of flavor and that's why this place is awesome. Big John gave a great show and was friendly with all of us. If you want great food and a free show in Vegas, go see Big John."

As far as sushi goes they have a happy hour from 11-close which brings down some prices of the sushi they serve. Teppanyaki on the other hand also has a late night special starting at midnight. I always go with steak and shrimp. The cooks there always puts on a show for you to make sure your visit is phenomenal. They make you many different dipping sauces for your entree and are always willing to make you a sauce of your choice if your not feeling the sauces they made for you. Overall great place to eat late."

All the sauces are made fresh right in front of us. \nService is very prompt -- our drinks were refilled immediately. \nOur chef John was awesome!  Very fun, personable and really entertaining. \nI had the filet and calamari - ordered rare and it was cooked to perfection. He had the lobster, prawns and steak. Wonderful. The amount of food is crazy. We had the fried sweet banana dessert and it was yummy. \nNo better bet in Vegas than this place.  I highly recommend."
