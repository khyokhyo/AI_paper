Service was great as well, however I rate due to the taste because service is only relevant to the individual servers. I would rather go to Hash House or Mr. Mamas!"

But we were seated within 10. \n\nOur waiter was nice and helpful. There were other servers that were helpful too even though it wasn't their table to serve which is a plus. The hostess could greet their customers better. Just a hi and how's your day, also Didn't smile much. I noticed it wasn't just us. I greeted them more. \n\nFood... Was great. I ordered the spinach Benny. Eggs Benedict with potatoes on the side. I'm picky with my poached eggs and they made it perfect. Not too wet or to cooked like some other places I've been to. My BF ordered original house burrito and he said that was good. I tried it and it was good too. Lastly we ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I've never had choc chip pan cakes before but for having it the first time. I loved it. \n\nPrices were good not too expensive. Would definitely come here again."

            "review": "Thanks to Yelp and the good ol community of yelpers out there i know A LOT of places where 10 bucks can go a LONG way in providing some good eats.\n\nMy Buddy recommended The Egg & I after hearing some good things about it from other sources. I've driven by this place multiple times and it's caught my attention a few time while in the same plaza as B&C Camera. \n\nThey have a diverse menu of egg related items. I was about to order one of the combo skillets because another table's home fries looked GOOD but ended up getting a Hawaiian themed plate which featured Portuguese Sasuage or Spam (went for the sausage), rice, two eggs any style (sunny side up), \"sticky\" rice (turned out to be calrose rice). Also came with a choice of what ever bread or the banana nut muffin everyone raves about. \n\nI choose the muffin and man oh man it did not disappoint. Blueberry's always been my favorite muffin and to be honest i havent eaten enough muffins in my life time. If i were in a situation where the entire fate of humanity rested upon my recommendation for a muffin it would be The Egg & I's banana nut hands own, sorry humanity you had your chance i'm throwing this one out and if it lands under the bus so be it. \n\nOverall the island favorite plate was good, obviously the Portuguese sausage made the dish but in all honesty it wasnt worth the price. Even with the banana nut muffin dreams are made of it still wasnt quite worth it. For the same price my buddy got one of the combo skillets and he ended up easily with three times more food then i did.\n\nSo far i do like this place. Outdoor seating was available immediately seeing as it was a cold morning but their heaters are very powerful and aside from a few gusts of wind there was very little outdoor discomfort. Looking at other people's plate was very easy on the eyes as their selection of food is diverse yet seeing common dishes amongst different diners makes me want to come back and get what they're getting because they cant all be wrong."

This restaurant, provides great service and food.  The servers are knowledgable of their menu.  The food is deliciously prepared and served.  The busier times you will have provide your name to the host stand, the wait has been only fifteen minutes.  And if  your server asks your bread choice, ask for the Banana bread."

Its not uber cheap (average $8) but they do give you good portions, and their muffin is great. \n\nThe coffee is just ok, but they bring a pot like IHOP and you pour to your heart's content. Lucky there's a Starbucks 1/2 block up the street. :D\n\nService is egg-selent!  Plenty of parking.  It can get crowded on weekends."

Today we again encountered the service we have grown accustomed to. Although it was packs, Curtis continued to check in with us.

We were eating with a 4 and 2 year old, he understood the urgency. Curtis is fantastic!"

We received wonderful service from our waitress STACI. She was on top of refills and making sure we liked what we ordered. . I would go back again just because STACI's service was great.

Since it's a locals place, it gets pretty crowded, so don't come thinking you're not going to have to wait a bit before getting a seat.  It's totally worth it.  Located right off the strip, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat without hassling with the nearby hotels.  The prices are reasonable and they have a huge menu to choose from.  Even the pickiest of eaters have something to pick, no matter how difficult they might be.\n\nIt's a country style restaurant with a variety of egg dishes.  My favorite is the Eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce is creamy and perfect and it's paired with some seasoned potatoes.  I like them, but they aren't my favorite.\n\nTheir biscuits and gravy are pretty awesome as well. A great dish to serve with the table, but if you're starving, you might want to try to conquer them by yourself."

A friend of mine was also in Vegas and had his car and said he could take me off the strip to eat if I wanted to work of course I took him up on the offer. Browsed through yelp and found this cute joint. The good portions are HUGE and yummy. I also liked that they have the happy egg or sad egg card that you put on a stand to let wait staff know you need something instead of them constantly checking on you. I say if you're in the area or in Vegas with a car this would be a great breakfast stop. Also, if you check in you get free banana bread -- mhmmm."

So we walk in and request an outside table and were seated in a timely manner. The hostess seated us that had the tip still on the table and I thought that maybe she didn't see so I let her know oh the tip is still on the table and she had a bit of an attitude while telling me the server would grab it. The server, Amanda, came over to us and greeted us and we told her what happened. I wasn't that upset but I just thought it was kind of ridiculous. Anyways our server was really great! Bubbly and cute and super friendly. She even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! I love that! I guess it's company policy they leave the tip on the table due to bussers stealing tips. \n\nSo on to the food. I got what I always do, it's just a platter with potatoes sausage toast and eggs and it's always delicious. My brother got banana but French toast and Biola got regular French toast and it was fricking fantastic.  \n\nOnce again I'd just like to say how amazing our server was! Thanks Amanda! Also I hope you win that trip to Disneyland!"

I normally get the classic eggs (with cheddar jack cheese), bacon (it's crispy!), their country potatoes, and 9 grain toast. If I don't order that then I order their parfait. I know, parfait sounds lame but their parfait comes in a big old school milkshake glass with yogurt, granola, and a mix of fresh fruits.

I was not a fan of their potatoes and I normally love potatoes. But there's is clearly frozen potatoes that they just fried and added some powder flavoring. It also was overcooked. I got an egg omelette and they are suppose to be famous for \"EGGS\". So why was my eggs overcooked as well?! My whole family and I were not impressed whatsoever with the quality of food. The service was ok. Price is reasonable. But the quality of the food and the ingredients weren't that impressive. As mentioned, this place is highly overrated."

Being on a low carb diet, I opted out of the banana muffin and potatoes, but they both looked delicious. The wait for brunch was about 20 minutes for peak Saturday time, but so worth it. Our server, Liza was very personable and prompt with service. We got our meals hot, fresh and quick with the epitomy of service with a smile. Well off the strip so our meal for four of us was $55, which was what my husband I spent yesterday,  splitting a breakfast omelette yesterday at a breakfast spot on the strip."

THE stuffed french toast: french toast stuffed with egg, sausage and cheese topped with powdered sugar. It's a heavenly mix of savory and sweet, especially dipped in maple syrup.\n\nMost of their entrees come with their homemade potatoes. They're lightly fried to give a french fry crisp and cajun-flavored that makes it taste like Lay's BBQ chips!!\n\nThis place is better than the all time popular Hash House A-go-go!!

The pro is that is food portion is pretty large, and the staff are super friendly unlike Hash A Go-Go where the hostesses are super snobby because they think they have power toco trial when you could be seated. The hostesses at Eggs & I are super friendly & do their best to find tables for large party. They even gave us extra banana muffins for free for the long wait & the muffins are yummy."

The waitress is what made me change my mind very friendly and attentive (perfect service). Now to the food, not sure why this place got such high ratings but i wasn't that impressed. They seem to be all about the omelets so the other stuff might not be so good; to start i got a side of biscuits and gravy... more like stale dry biscuits with not enough gravy so again not off to a good start. So the main dish yeah i should have got an omelet but with so many choices i couldn't decide so i got the cabo breakfast burrito... bad choice the burrito was soggy smothered in sauce it was just very un appetizing and the side of house potatoes covered in that texas seasoning was one cold and dry so i don't know if i just got the last of that batch but my experience here was nothing short of just meh nothing that dennys couldn't have filled. Overall the service here at least from my waitress was what gave this a 3 star but the food was not what i expected; especially from the high reviews this place got. NEXT"

Anyways my husband had the bacon avacado omelet and he added sausage.Very yummy!  I had country fried steak with eggs (medium over medium) pefect when I cut into the egg the yellow runneth gold over. It was amazing. I had the country fried steak it was good and gravy was definitely homemade, yummy. My only compliant is the gravy was a tad bit too salty for my tastebuds, and I love salty. ...other than that it was perfect. It was already buttered to perfection!  Attention to detail. At home I love my toast buttered immediately so it has time to melt. And they did that. This place is a must go!"

The black egg means all is well at your table. The yellow egg signals the staff you would like assistance. We were getting pressed for time to get to the airport and wanted to-go cups for our coffee. We turned the egg to black and a staff member showed up immediately to help us out. Neat idea as this signal is not only for your waiter, but for the entire staff. \nWe walked in around 8:30 on a Saturday morning and were seated immediately. By the time we left there was a line out the door. \nWe had the Country Benny and Grandma's biscuits and gravy, both with the hash browns. Excellent choices. Anyone familiar with Bojangles on the east coast and their seasoned fries, the hash browns here have a similar flavor. Very good."

We can't miss it when we come to town and every time the service is fantastic! \nThis place isn't very big and it gets crowded on weekends. We arrived at about 10:30 on a Saturday morning, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table. Our food came out faster and we were in and out in a little over an hour including great conversation.\nBefore our food came to the table, our server, Stacy, introduced herself and brought us the delicious banana bread muffins with butter. \nI ordered the eggs Benedict and some orange juice. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and not too thick. The eggs were perfectly poached. Together with the Canadian bacon, everything was well balanced. Sometimes, if the hollandaise sauce is over seasoned, the combination of the hollandaise with Canadian bacon leaves the dish too salty. That definitely wasn't the case here.\nThroughout our meal, Stacy was fantastic. She kept checking on us. At one point I needed an additional napkin and was about to flip the egg when the manager walked up to ask what we needed. Although Stacy did bring the check a little early, she apologized, ensured us that there was no rush and brought me the additional orange juice I wanted to order.\nWhen we were done, one of the other servers noticed my injury and offered to help me up. I really appreciated her concern. This place is great!"

We only discovered it since our hotel (The Artisan) was nearby and we used our Yelp app to find the closet breakfast place that wasn't a buffet (by day 3 of buffet hopping, I needed major portion control).\n\nEven though it was Mother's Day and the line was out the door, this tiny restaurant somehow managed to get everyone seated quickly and keep diners moving through the door. The menu was quite extensive for breakfast with everything from stuffed french toast to eggs benedict to the infamous breakfast burrito. I tried the eggs benedict, which came with ranch potatoes and a huge portion of fruit. The orange juice was the best part though, it tasted like it was just squeezed in the kitchen.\n\nHighly recommended if you are staying \"off the strip,\" in Downtown Vegas or if you are on your way out of town!"

The banana muffin came out steaming hot as if they put it in a microwave. When I tried to eat it, it was so tough that a knife couldn't even cut through it. I asked for another one and asked that it not be heated in a microwave. They claimed it wasn't. I don't understand how it was steaming hot and so tough and hard around the edges. Then, when I got their potato scramble, the cheese all over the top was hard and not the soft, melted type of cheese. So if you ate your potatoes, you could pick up a whole layer of cheese. Again, it was overcooked. It's too bad because the flavors were there in both the potatoes and the muffin. The biscuits and gravy were good."

Originally my friends and I wanted to eat at Peppermill for brunch before leaving Vegas but the wait for 6 people was over 40 minutes. Called in to check for the wait here and was happy enough to find that we would only have to wait for 20 minutes despite it being packed.\n\nThere isn't much space inside for customers to sit while waiting for their table; you'll most likely have to wait outside and that kind of sucks especially in the hot summer weather. When we got seated, we were promptly given the menu and starter drinks. Service here is on point. Karla, our server, went out of her way to make everything as easy as possible for us. Instead of having us go to the front ourselves to split our check, she went ahead and split it six ways for us. I LOVE YOU KARLA.\n\nFood portion here is very generous. You definitely will get the bang for your buck because most of the food items costs $8-$12 and only one person in my group was able to finish his order. Whatever you order, make sure the potatoes are included or order it on the side! There's Cajun seasoning on it, I think, and it's amaaaazing. You won't regret coming here!\n\nP.S. there's this cute egg centerpiece on your table. Instead of flagging a waitress/waiter down, just flip it from its black side to the yellow side and someone will come to your table. How cool is that??"

I've never watched Rachel Ray, but if this is the kind of place she recommends, then I cannot trust her opinion.\n\nThis was another one of those \"it's more about saying you've been there, rather than the food\" type of places.  A lot of things on the menu sounded great.  \n got the Chicken Enchilada Omelet.  It was ok.\nI forgot what my girlfriend ordered, but it sounded fantastic on the menu.  It was ok.\nMy friend ordered pork chops and eggs.  Looked great.  He said it was ok.\nMy cousin and her hubby ordered whatever it was that Rachel Ray had ordered.  She was spouting off about how great it was, but honestly, it didn't even look that good.  Her enthusiasm seemed forced.\nThe other members of our party weren't very pleased with their breakfasts either.\n\nThis place is only open until 2 pm.  So you better get there early.  Don't worry about me holding up your table though, because I won't be back.  I'll be at Blueberry Hill, on Flamingo Rd., enjoying a very good breakfast for about half the price."

W/in 30 mins i threw up ,w/in 1hr he also did the same & has not stoped all day vomiting.  I finally called & spoke 2a manager, the lady was nice &suggested  i call the operarions manager. I said no . but u need thow that gravey shit away!!"

Muffin lived up to the hype in terms of taste, but not size. If we are talking about a life-changing muffin, it needs to be a little bigger. I wanted 2 of these.\n\nShoulda went with the crowd and got the Eggs-cellent Omelette. Kay's Special caught my eye cause it sounded like spinach artichoke dip but made into omelette form. It was really tasty but the 3 Eggs-cellent Omelettes at the table kept overshadowing my dish. But that was my fault and not the fault of Egg & I. \n\nPotatoes were completely covered in a paprika type spice blend. It made them really dry. A good dousing of ketchup cured the dryness.\n\nOverall your typical uber greasy breakfast that will make you feel ridiculously full all day long. The muffin made the experience above average."

Fried potatoes that come with many entrees are mediocre. Biscuits and Gravy are good. Mashed potato omelette is exactly what it sounds like. Ironically, I was expecting something different or creative. It was okay. Pancakes were really good. Service was great! Establishment is not that bad, but a little ronchy due to all the green...just weird."

A friend who resided in Sin City decided to take me and my girlfriends here after a long night & morning of partying/clubbing/gambling. I told him I want a place with bomb breakfast & local flavor. Egg & I delivered just that! \n\nI had a slight hangover and the hustle & bustle of the busy atmosphere did not aid in it going away. However, I was cured after I had some OJ, Egg Crepe & superr delicious potatoes! I do not know what type of seasoning is doused over those cut up potatoes they servve but it sure did hit the spot! I even joked with our waitress asking if they sell the seasoning (which unfortunately, they don't). The portions are pretty huge so if you don't eat a whole lot like myself, think of sharing with a friend.  I couldn't let my food go to waste so I got a to-go box which definitely came in handy during the road trip back to Long Beach."

I appreciate the choices in coffee creamers and the carafe being left of the table, which saves the hassle of tracking down a server for a refill when you've got a small cup o' joe. Good coffee, but I come here for the eggs. \n\nI ordered the hash, but our table also ordered a pancake plate and a waffle works. The waffles look light and crisp, the pancakes are fluffy and have a variety of fillings (but I think we got charged a different-than-base-price for these, so ask or watch out? Our server suggested something after we handed over the menus), and the crispy little home fried potatoes are so tasty! (I got a half serving of these, half serving of fruit--which is plenty of both!) My hash was homemade and nothing like that cubed canned corned beef hash, but it was pretty salty for my tastes. My eggs came out EGGsactly right and were mouthwateringly delicious for something so simple--eggs. My fiance asked for tomatoes in his scrambled eggs, and those were extra too, and we weren't informed of that/how much until we saw it on the check (the pancake chocolate chips and the tomatoes somehow managed to be about $5, so I don't know how that stacks up, but it peeved me a bit).\n\nIf they ask you if you want toast or the banana muffin, DO NOT GET TOAST. GET THE DANG MUFFIN. It is sooooo good. It doesn't look like anything special, mostly because it's flat on top and served upside down, but it's soft and moist and tasty and warm and goodness gracious, so amazing. If you're counting calories, #1 you're in the wrong place, #2 put butter on it anyway.\n\nThe little eggy signs are so helpful for when you need to track down your server--a great idea instead of trying to get someone's attention in the (can be) noisy atmosphere. \n\nThis place is fantastic, but I pulled a star because the server forgot a side order for half the meal and didn't notify us of the upcharges on the items at time of order and after suggesting (i.e. we order regular pancakes, he suggests blueberry or chocolate chip, but doesn't mention they cost extra) after taking the menus so we couldn't see ourselves. I know some things are extra, but how much sometimes influences people's decisions--knowing if it was $0.50 versus $2.00 would have made that difference, for example. Overall, will DEFINITELY come again."

My boyfriend's skillet (the one with sausage and ham) was ok and was probably the best thing I tried there. His mother's bacon and cheese omelette was not very good and she ate less than half. The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over. I thought homefries were supposed to be seasoned with salt, pepper, onions and green peppers... The one good thing about this place was the wait time. 10 minutes for a party of four on a Sunday morning."

Big varied menu, friendly service, great food, kid-welcoming, clean, and clearly very highly rated year after year as all the framed Zagat reviews on the front wall testify.  Great experience."

I'm not exactly sure but yum it was delicious. Definitely coming back for this dish next time I'm in Vegas. \nTheir blueberry pancakes were packed with plump blueberries. Saved the banana nut muffin for the drive home immediately after breakfast.. Very tasty, once you start you cant stop. The place was packed on the Sunday we visited but the wait was not bad at all. Glad we came here instead of a buffet on the Blvd."

But hats off to Egg & I because we were able to be seated quickly ( when at other restaurants it would take about 40 mins to be seated) \n\nMake sure that if you decide to come here that you use yelp and check in to get yourself a banana nut muffin.. The muffin was super light and moist and delicious.\n\nThere are so many different things to pick from on the menu.. The menu is super creative.. I got the breakfast burrito and it was the perfect size for my appetite.. The salsa for it was delicious too (I asked for extra).. I left full and ready for the day.\n\nSo I would definitely recommend  this place if you are hungry, because of the price, the amount of food, and the service. Is it mind blowing you ask? No, but it is definitely better then average. Hence the 4 star. I'm going to definitely come back."

We were all starving and all a little out of if @_@ (as you should be when devouring food in Vegas). \n\nI ordered the basic eggs, potatoes, and sausage breakfast. I opted for the banana muffin and was so glad I did. They make it in house and was warm and delicious. My main dish was really greasy and hit the spot good! They were generous with the sausage portions. I wasn't feeling that adventurous that day, but others in my group ordered the chicken enchilada omelette, Tacos Rancheros, and Huevos Rancheros and all loved their dishes. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely be back on my next Vegas visit!"

I got the works skillet with a banana muffin (I swear, best banana muffin I've ever had!), my bf got the mashed potato omelette with 4 pieces of toast on the side, and we also got an additional order of waffles with whipped cream! \n\nThe works skillet comes with works potatoes, bacon, sausage and ham, then topped with eggs (any style) and gooey cheese! So good and very very filling. The mashed potato omelette also comes with the works potatoes on the side. Seriously, the omelette is huge (4 eggs!)! It's filled with bacon and garlic mashed potatoes then topped with cheese and sour cream. The waffles are just okay, plain but tasty. We definitely enjoyed our meal!\n\nService was fast and excellent considering they were so busy that day. Our waiter is a pleasant guy and he's very efficient. \n\nOur order came up to 35 bucks. Pretty reasonable since portions are huge, coffee is bottomless, and food is really good! Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"

The potatoes had a bit too much seasoning salt for my taste, by everything else was amazing.\n\nThe service really took things up a notch. They have a stand on the table where you flip the egg over if you need service. Different servers stopped in and refilled our drink while we were eating. Our glasses never got less than half-empty.\n\nDefinitely try either location. Every plate we saw being served up looked amazing!"

Second,  the food is not that great. It's just big slabs of cheese basically on the omelettes, and there was no flavor. Where's the flavor?! I had a bacon and avocado omelete. It had little bacon bits cooked into the egg, and it was hardly noticeable. The avocado was in a big chunk in the middle. Then it was covered in cheese and had some sour cream on top. Maybe strips of bacon would be better. Then maybe it could be tasted. \nthe potatoes are way too salty and taste weird. they definitely seemed like they were frozen. My husband was not impressed with his omelete neither. \n\nWith all the reviews we thought this place would be better. The atmosphere was drab, and the attitudes of the workers was somethin else.

I don't think we ever used it, but I had looked it up on Yelp last year, and remembered it had good reviews.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, 4/2/11. While eating a breakfast of homemade blueberry waffles and chillin on the patio, Lawrence T. was telling me all about how much he loved breakfast foods - all kinds. I was trying to figure out where we were would eat before we headed off to The Adventure Dome later during the day (we ended up not going.) I was bummed when he said breakfast foods were where his heart was, because it's my least favorite meal of the day. \n\nAround 2 PM, after driving around and me not remembering the names or addresses of the places that I wanted to try on the west side (where he lives) I spotted \"Egg & I.\" Despite the fact I'm not into breakfast, I decided to suck it up and offer this place as an option because Lawrence had told me he liked breakfast so much. It helped that I vaguely remembered that it had good reviews here on Yelp. \n\nUpon walking in, you get hit in the face with the \"breakfast\" restaurant smell. You know what I'm talking about. We were seated immediately and took it all in. Lawrence was all into the fact they had soccer on their tv and that they had a zillion choices on their menu. Despite the extensive choices, not too long after sitting down, we ordered. I got the tortilla soup and house salad with ranch, and Lawrence got some omelet and fruit... and was mistakenly given a humongous side of the most delicious skinny fries ever (the problem was quickly remedied by a pregnant lady who worked there bringing him the fruit he actually ordered.) \n\nThe tortilla soup, while not the type I'm used to was SO good, I could not stop eating it. The house salad rocked, especially with the sprouts on top, and the ranch dressing was on par with that of The Mad Onion (aka DELICIOUS!) I didn't try any of Lawrence's fruit or omelet, but the few fries I stole off of his plate were the best fries I'd ever tasted. Yeah, they're that good. \n\nI have to agree with Bonnie G.'s statement that, \"You know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.\"  Lawrence kept eating his fries, while saying he should stop because he was tired of fried foods... but they were too tempting, even when blanketed by napkins on top to hide them from view, hehe.  I was so full toward the end of the meal, but my salad was so good, it was hard to finally push the remainder away.  \n\nFor our meals + coffee + $5 tip, it came out to $27 and some change. We both confided over our meal that we weren't sure about how good this place would be when we pulled up to the place, but after trying the food, it was super bomb."

My crazy chicken  omelet, which is described as \"Loaded with julienned chicken breast, fresh mushrooms and guacamole. Topped with muenster cheese and sour cream.\" on the website, had flavorless dark meat chicken, and mushy old guacamole that was terrible.\nDon't trouble yourself with this establishment, food should be a delight, not a stressful experience."

I will say this, though... great service.  I had the corned beef hash.  They top it off with an egg.  I LOVE CBH, but I wouldn't order this again.  I was with three friends.  They had scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, and a chili cheese omelette.  Scrambled eggs are the same everywhere.  The eggs benedict had WAY too much hollandaise sauce.  The omelette, though, was killer.  In fact, we stopped eating our dishes and ate from her plate.  What?  Now... the banana nut muffin.  I didn't think it was all that.  Good flavor, but mine was kind of hard.  The girls, though... I swear they had an orgasm."

I wouldn't reorder it however.  Its not like its from a can or anything, its shredded ham and the flavor is different then what I believe Hash should taste like  The Banana Nut muffin was pretty good, but again I have had better.  The servers are nice and the place is adorable.  \n\nHowever if you want your Socks knocked of for breakfast go to the Hash House A Go Go, its a little further West up Sahara and on the right.  That place has the best breakfast I have ever had.\nOverall I must say Egg & I is a good place.  A  decent breakfast, however for egg critiques take a look at the pictures, unless you order an eggs Benny they over cook most of there eggs."

This is one of my favorite places in Vegas to have breakfast and they're typically open until about 3 pm, 7 days a week. You have to try their potatoes and banana nut muffins, they so good and addictive! I usually go for the omelets when I come here, and no matter which one you order, they're all delicious. If you have ever been to Egg Works, this place is owned by the same people, but is just a little smaller in size and menu."

            "review": "At a little before 7am on a Sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  This was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the Vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  Here's the best recommendation I can give about the food: I came back for breakfast the next day!  And we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nWe got off to a good start.  When the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm banana nut muffin to try.  It's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nWhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words Habla Diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  My wife wanted the Spinach Benny, but was concerned about the Habla Diablo potatoes because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  The waitress explained that it wasn't spicy at all, that Habla Diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  My wife went ahead with her spinach benny and I got the loco moco, with an extra side of the Habla Diablo potatoes.  (It turns out that the Habla Diablo seasoning is a lot like Lawry's Seasoned Salt.)\n\nMy wife really liked her spinach benny, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (But she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  I liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  Plus the loco moco was the best I've had on the mainland!\n\nThe next day, I came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  This time I had the Biscuits & Gravy, which were great.  But, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   Then I picked out the California Crepe for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  I asked to substitute some fruit for the Habla Diablo potatoes, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  My wife loved the California Crepe, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!"

Eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. It's too adorable. The menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!\n\nWe went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. If you want to start your day right in Vegas, this is definitely one of your options.\n\nThe lasting impression? \"Love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at Egg & I!\""

Because I'd never had it elsewhere, maybe I'm a little biased - but I know good food!\n\nThe second time I had the chili omelet. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh delicious. They have a meat/no meat option, which is cool. And obviously I opted for the meat option. It was all cooked perfectly.\n\nMy favorite item has to be the potatoes though. Perfect little square-cut potatoes that are seasoned with what I can only describe as a mixture of the Red Robin's burger seasoning and tiny little kicks to your mouth. It's spicy but...not, if that makes sense? Probably not. You really just to go in and try.\n\nSome plates come with what they call diabla sauce and it's delicious but beware - they charge $1 for extra.\n\nAnother plus: you get a choice of toast or muffins and I think last time I was there I counted six different bread options LOL. Plenty of variety! And the menu is insane. Trust me, it will be hard to choose."

I went with a party of 8 and the service was excellent. Someone recommended the stuffed French toast and although it didn't really sound like my kind of thing I ordered it. Well, I'm glad I did because that thing is awesome! Perfectly cooked eggs with the right amount of cheese and sausage. The French toast was done just right as well. So, I suppose it really depends on what you have here and what your tastes are. For example, I tried those muffins everyone at our table was raving about and I didn't like them. Go figure!"

We went thru two, the one that came with the skillet and the free one with checkin.  \n\nOur server Linnea was very attentive, and even with a packed house it was just a short wait when we needed some service.  \n\nVery good place, will definitely have to make another visit when back in Vegas"

We'd gotten rid of our rental car the day before so we'd have to take a taxi to either.  At the spur of the moment, we picked the Egg & I.  Yay for us for picking an awesome joint.  We waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  I'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.  They were banana nut muffins.  We both ate the entire thing.  So good.  And with a great cup of coffee, we could've stopped right there.  But we didn't!  Since breakfast is not my favorite meal, I love it when I find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  There were so many options I had to choose from.  I was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the Tacos Rancheros.  I chose the Tacos Rancheros.  It was a tortilla topped with refried beans, ground hamburger, two eggs (which I got fried) and topped with cheese and sour cream.  I would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  My partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  It was enormous.  She could only eat half of it to which our server, Karla suggested getting the half order next time!  Shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  But, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  We both loved the Old Bay seasoned fried potatoes.  As we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  Very nice.  Oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  That's a brilliant idea!  Karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!"

My only gripe, was they had MSG sprinkled all over it.  I didn't realize it until my thirst level started to slowly creep up.  I took another close look and felt sick to my stomach.  Why, do you need MSG in fried potatoes? Why?\n\nTo end on a good note, I really enjoyed my slice of grapefruit and honeydew and opted not to order the muffin or toast. \n\nI should have stuck with good old Blueberry Hills Family."

The free banana nut muffin at check in is probably the most moist, gooey and orgasmic muffin I ever had. Please don't forget to order that to try. Overall, a wonderful and unbeatable brunch experience away from the strip."

Their habla diablo potatoes are  pretty good. Crispy on the outside,  soft on the inside and dry seasoned with a reddish spice mixture that is slightly spicy. \n\nNew York steak and eggs - this is an egg based restaurant that served cold, browned (aka overcooked)  scrambled eggs?! The steak was thin, cold,  and lacking any flavor. Their signature habla diablo potatoes were probably the only really good part of the dish. \n\n(I know that there is no built in firewall against poorly cooked eggs at an egg based restaurant but c'mon) \n\nMimosas:\nYou're given a small, unopened bottle of champagne turned upside down in a glass Mason jar. A cup of pulpy orange juice is served on the on the side.  I like that you can control the ratio of champagne to orange juice. \n\nThe atmosphere:\nFarmhouse chic. Packed with patrons. There is an open air patio in the back (pets allowed). Booths in the middle, tables along the walls. \n\nThe entryway deserves a paragraph to itself.\n One. Big. Clusterf**k. People are waiting to be seated and are either sitting along the walls or standing (most likely in the way of someone). People are lining up to be placed on the seating wait list. People are sitting or standing along the wall just inside the dining room and outside of the front door. People are ordering food to-go. People are lining up or grouping together like a human barricade, waiting to pay their bill. Honestly, even the hostess could not tell me where the line ended to pay the bill. After being one of the few courteous people constantly moving out of others' way, a new line has formed and of course they want to act like you cut them in line."

Get the banana nut muffin whether it's included or not. It was so good, it tasted like a dessert. To add butter or anything else to it would be a crime, it was perfect the way it was. My wife had waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Typically, she does not eat large portion meals without sliding some of it across the table to me. She polished off the whole thing. I had some kind of special that came with four scrambled eggs mixed with bacon, spinach, mushrooms and loads of cheese and some kind of side of potatoes that was eye-rolling awesome. I've been on this planet for over half a century and I honestly don't remember the last time I had a breakfast that tasted this good from start to finish.

Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. \n\nEven though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. \n\nIt honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.\n\nThe dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. \n\nFOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning \nTOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this one"

Everything on the menu comes with eggs, what do you expect at \"Egg & I\"? They come with eggs but not with \"U\" of course, we don't eat people. The potato is amazing! I don't like potato but I like this type. It's diced-potato with tasty spice or could be just salt but very tasty. I don't eat much salt but I don't feel that it's salty, just tasty. I've tried different types of omelettes here and thought they're pretty big. Of all the omelette that I ordered so far, I liked Works Vege Omelette and Traditional Omelette. Not a big fan of Chili omelette. Last visit I had just the classic 2 Sunnyside up with toasted English muffin. Had something like this with multigrain before and fruit plate but this time I had it with cottage cheese. Hubby had eggs with potato but usually he would order it with bacon or ham too but I begged hubby to get something without meat for breakfast this time. Whatever you order here is great. I've tried many and highly recommended! Coffee is ok not so much on the \"wow\" side but they give you a pot for a table, so drink up your caffeine and then go play and win a jackpot!"

It was nice for a while until it started getting humid and nasty but we stuck it through.\n\nWe had the Eggceptional Omelette (3 stars), Bacon Avocado & Egg (4 stars) - these flavors ALWAYS mesh well together!, The chicken fried steak skillet (5 stars) and the cinnamon raisin french toast (2 stars).\n\nA tip: stay away from the cinnamon raisin french toast. Couldn't taste the cinnamon in it at all and it was kind of soggy. Not the heavenly experience in your mouth you get when you think of french toast ... mmmm. BUT get the chicken fried steak skillet!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Scrambled eggs on top. So yummy.\n\nAnd of course, the banana nut muffin is still my favorite of all time here!"

The corn beef was average although it was home made, muffin was cold and the potatoes tasted deep fried with a to much seasoned salt.

Its regular customer must be some one who likes the artificial sugar syrup they serve at cheap restaurants. It wasn't even an option for an additional charge.\n\nTo be fair, my kids didn't care their Mickey Mouse pancakes came with sugar syrup. And the prices for everything were reasonable. While I didn't find their eggs Benedict too salty (I am not salt sensitive), the MSG in the Hollindaise was palpable and the famous Diablo potatoes were \"meh\" (and I like spicy!). On the plus side, their banana nut muffins were delicious, as advertised."

My husband and I ordered the Cabo and Santa Cruz breakfast burritos with the works potatoes. We were reassured by the wait staff that it was pure deliciousness and it was! Our burritos were made up of four scrambled eggs,  saut\u00e9ed bell peppers and onions, cheddar cheese,  chorizo, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla and topped with their signature Santa Cruz sauce & a dollop of sour cream. My 12 year-old decided to be adventurous and order the stuffed french toast, stuffed with scrambled eggs, sausage and sprinkled with powered sugar with warm maple syrup on the side. Definitely, a taste bud explosion. Thank you Egg & I...we will NOT forget you!"

Sometimes being on the strip is just too congested and I crave some sense of normalcy... and buffets are just too much food and too expensive.\n\nHence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(\n\nWhen I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.\n\nI tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.\n\nServers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  It was a good experience, I think I like Blueberry Hill more, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning here again."

We had been in Vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  I found the Egg & I using my awesome Yelp iPhone app.  Everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both Egg & I and to Yelp at the end of the meal.\n\nThe special of the day was the Prime Rib Skillet, Prime Rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  Two people at our table of six went for the special.  Other meals included a Brad's Scramble, two Chicken Fried Steak Skillets, and mine was the Kay's Omelette (Four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic and cream cheese. Topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  Everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.\n\nOne friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  She started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  Very nice customer service.  My friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.\n\nThe standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  These are the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had, and I love breakfast potatoes!  The seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.\n\nThere are plenty of great reviews for this place, so I don't need to go on and on.  Just one more final thought.  When I am coming home from a trip I always like to look back and think about what I learned during the trip.  On this trip, I learned a few things . . .\n\n1 - Don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of Guinness, chances are it may fall in.\n2 - Cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  Even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again.\n3 - Add the Egg & I to the \"must-have\" list anytime I'm in Vegas!"

Both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"  \n\nAnyhow, I try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.\n\nFirst off, the SERVICE was great.  We came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  What's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something I've never seen before.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  She was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  I love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  \n\nAs for the FOOD, my friends and I ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  You could also have your choice of sausage.  Now, I know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items I\"ve ever had.  Everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  I had two eggs that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  Also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a banana nut muffin.  It was the best banana nut muffin I've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.\n\nMy other friends ordered the country fried chicken breast skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  I got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nWhat I found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  It was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  One side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  Apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  Anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that I've been too!\n\nLastly, the PRICE is extremely affordable.  An entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  I sort of wish they had one in Orange County but I'll definitely come back here with friends the next time I visit vegas."

The menus are quite charming as they look like your local newspaper and there are many delicious options.

I really enjoyed the gravy on the biscuits and the home fries, where are very well seasoned. The rest of my party got a ham and bacon omelette with home fries and a blueberry muffin, along with a chicken salad sandwich on rye bread with cranberries and walnuts. All three of us ended up eating half the plates so we have some food to go with us on the 4 1/2 hour trip back home. \nOverall, great food, nice service and reasonable prices.

Did a quick yelp search and Egg & I appeared.\n\nTo make the review short: the skillets were huge and nicely made. Prime rib benedict was on point. But the star? The warm muffin. Could just eat that for breakfast and nothing else.\n\nService is great too. Our server, Thay, took our group pictures voluntarily and filled our glasses and coffee mugs frequently. Awesome food and service makes for a great experience. \n\nCasino buffets move aside. Come here for breakfast but leave a spot open for me.\n\n5/5 would come again."

The place was packed, obviously very popular.\n\nThe menu is extensive, quite a few breakfast items to choose from. Obviously eggs are the feature here with a large omelette selection. The place is homey, and they have murals of farm lands all over the walls. \n\nI decided to get the Mexican Omelette - Chorizo, chiles and onions and cheese, topped with sour cream. Came with a heaping side of potatoes and choice of bread - I got wheat.\n\nOverall I was kind of underwhelmed by the dish. Usually I love chorizo, but for some reason this omelette just did not meld like it should. \n\nService was SLOW. Yes, it was busy on a Saturday, but there came a point when my husband looked up and said, \"Where's the food?\". Never a good sign when you actually start questioning whether or not they put the order in.\n\nThey did have a very yummy banana nut muffin, which I highly suggest getting if you come here. AND (as of this writing) if you check in on Yelp, you get one for free!\n\nThis is definitely a go-to breakfast spot if you live in the area. But, if you live elsewhere in the valley I am sure you can find a place that is just as good, if not better. I still like Black Bear Diner over Egg & I for breakfast."

I also love their newspaper-like menus, very creative.  \n\nIt is a comfortable atmosphere and friendly service.  This is a popular restaurant, and we went on a Saturday morning, thus we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't bad at all. It took a while for us to decide on what to order because everything (they had quite a variety of choices on the menu) sounded so appetizing.  After we finally ordered, our food came out quickly, and everyone was pleased w/ each of our orders.  Everything looked very good and tasted great too.    \n\nIt's not located that far away from the Vegas Strip, and it's definitely worth the short drive.  It's also a nice getaway from the chaos and traffic where the casinos are.  I certainly couldn't have gotten a decent and fairly priced breakbreast/brunch meal somewhere on the Strip. From now on, whenever I visit Vegas, I'll have to goeat at Egg and I."

Came on Monday, June 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by Gia the manager and our waitress, Carole Ann.   They were both very personable.\n\nWe we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by Gia.  Carole Ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  No biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  \n\nGia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  She came out with two banana muffins for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  Those muffins were delicious.  Carole Ann came back and took our order.  I ordered the spam and egg over rice.  That came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin I thought that was it.  But she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but I declined.   My other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  \n\nThe food and service was great and I would have def gone back but my intentions while I was in Vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  \n\nThey don't take American Express, not sure if it's just at this location. \n\nThank you Carole Ann for great customer service, keep it up and I hope you get to meet Mickey Mouse!!!"

She was so nice and attentive, with a cheerful disposition even tho she was so busy. And she brought my husband his free muffin even tho he was having trouble with his yelp app to check in. He did eventually but was very happy that she did that, cause that muffin, oh that muffin....I think it's the best banana nut muffin I've had in my life, and I've had my share! Lol...my husband had 3 of the blueberry pancakes w/a side of bacon. He enjoyed his meal but didn't even touch his bacon because the pancakes are a pretty decent size with fresh blueberries in the pancake and on the side was a blueberry jam sauce? It was sweet just as he likes it. I'm not a huge pancake fan so I don't make it much at home so he was happy. I ordered the chile rellenos omelette and I'm so glad I did!  I saw someone's picture of it and thought it looked good!  It was!  The sauce was tasty and everything just worked so well together with the pepper...

She also made sure we had patio heater nearby. Even though there was only one other occupied table outside, we were still checked on frequently.\n\nI had a lovely vegetarian omelette, but I was really crazed over my banana nut muffin. It was better than I remember, and it was actually steaming in the cold weather. I felt bad for all the yum noises I was making because my husband is gluten free. Speaking of which, when the waitress asked what bread he wanted on the side, he said none, and she offered to bring him a side of fruit. He was very appreciative. My husband declared his corned beef hash to be the best he's ever had, and he might have gotten a second order if he didn't have part of my meal to finish off.\n\nThe Egg & I will continue to be a \"must-visit\" when we come to Vegas."

There is an outdoor dining patio, it does face the busy street, but it was quiet. Surprisingly.\n\nThe food is great, fresh, came out hot and the coffee is good. A great variety of breakfast and lunch items, and I am looking forward to going back because as i said, slow service but great food. Good tasting. Fair prices.

This thing was like a cake, literally.  It didn't have a \"bread\" texture, but it was rather good, something I've never had before and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  It came with syrup, which was a waste because the taste in the french toast was just right.\n\nPrices are cheap for what they serve, service is good, can't complain as the server stopped by a couple of times to check on us.

Kevin who is a carnivore went for their skillet with prime rib chopped in it and I got Kay's special.  The reason we'll come back though, is their banana nut muffin.  OMG it is soooo good we bought a loaf to take home.  I think we just picked the wrong menu items and next time will go for what everyone else gets."

Many of the female servers are quite attractive and helpful.\n\n2.  The male servers that I've had have all been invariably incompetent, rude and sometimes a combination of both.\n\n3.  For the price, (Bouchon's $18 version is slightly better) the corned beef hash is the best I've had in any restaurant.  The first time I came here, I tried it, and I don't think I've ever ordered anything else.\n\nBeyond that, the owner/manager lady provides a stalwart presence at the cash register with that unique mix of friendly/surly grandmotherliness that only American women in their 60's can truly evince."

Of course, as the name suggests, eggs are their specialty, but they offer much much more!\n\nThe waitress suggested I try the \"Loco Moco\" and I was not disappointed!! It was a beautifully, delicious symphony on my tongue!! Sticky rice, eggs (any way you like), hamburger patty, and brown gravy. \n\n I know what you're thinking...\"is this chick pregnant?!\" rest assured, I'm not (any more) and this dish really made sense once I took a bite!! Just wonderfully cooked and seasoned and all the different components played nice together in the tummy!\n (there's a party in my tummy...so yummy, so yummy yummy)\n\nIt's not in the nicest part of LV, but that's why I love finding these \"off-the-beaten-path\" joints!

I ordered the Fiesta Skillet which was a layer of their ranch potatoes topped with a mixture of green chilies, onions, and salsa.  On top of that was a layer of melted cheese and two eggs over-easy.  The skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  It was pretty tasty.  I really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.\n\nThere were three different types of Habla Diablo sauce on the table Original, Chipotle, and Verde.  So if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  Well not really since none of them are that spicy.  \n\nOverall  I enjoyed breakfast.  I have tried other items at their other locations they all taste good.  Would definitely be up there on the list of breakfast places to go."

It was seriously that good.\n\nWe ordered-\nbreakfast burrito (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+\nchicken fried steak: A (better to get sauce on side IMO)\nchicken omelet (it had a \"special\" name to it) A+\nDenver omelet (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+\nwhole wheat pancakes (HUGE ORDER!) A+\nPortions are big, so don't order too much!\n\nService was great! We had the same server all 3 days. She was surprised to see us back on the 2nd day, but was just laughing when she saw us the 3rd day. A bit funny I know :) She made sure our visit was pleasant, asking if we needing anything. The only thing I needed was help walking out their door, since I ate so much. \n\nI hope Egg and I continues to serve great food. Sadly we don't live in Vegas, so we can only visit when we need to sunbathe and gamble :) So that's twice a year, hopefully more!\n\nThanks Egg & I, for a 5 STAR experience."

I guess after seeing the 4 stars, made my eggspection higher. For the price I could just get any whole loaf of ordinary banana bread. It came out greasy and you just can't enjoy and finish the whole plate.  My friend ordered the pancakes and we agreed that it was the worst pancake we have ever tasted.  Well, it;s an egg place but considering it being a breakfast place, we eggspect better.  I look around and see people not finishing their plate, no wonder why.

The French toast was overbearingly sweet. The French toast on it's own without the strawberry madness was moist and fluffy; however, the strawberry filling along with the strawberry topping and the whip cream really overdid it. It was hard for me to finish.\n\nThe eggs and bacon were standard fare. Nothing to note. I tried some of my buddy's chicken fried steak. Again, decent seasoning, but tasted a bit too heavy for my liking. \n\nWhat stood out for me was the banana nut muffin. It was moist and the muffin top was crispy. Even better that it was free.

Our server Amanda is great! She carries a big nice smile in front of every customers :) not that long waiting time (I arrived at 12:30pm and had around 30 minutes wait which is totally worth after I tried) will definitely visit again next time when I come to Vegas!

Food wasn't greasy for whatever's thats worth.\n\nAs you may have guessed menu is egg-centric but fear not.  I decided to change things up during my latest visit and ordered hawaiian food.  Yep, you read that right and my internal organs as of a week later remain intact.  They offer: loco moco, spam and eggs and portuguese sausage and eggs.  Ordered both the spam and portuguese sausage and had no regrets.  Forgot the name of the breakfast burrito with the chorizo but it was dense AF and subsequently awesome.\n\nTheir homefries are also a must."

It was really busy when we arrived but the wait wasn't too terrible. We were seated inside, and it was really bustling. \nWith our Yelp check-in, we each received a free banana nut muffin, which was REALLY tasty. I ordered the Vegetarian Benedict (with bacon) and my husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and Blueberry Pancakes. My Benedict was really, really good, but I will say their hollandaise is seriously lacking in lemon juice. It didn't seem like an authentic hollandaise at all, but it tasted good. They know how to poach an egg beautifully, which made up for the sauce. The breakfast potatoes that come with every entree are very flavorful and crispy. My husband really liked his biscuits & gravy (he said the biscuits were very light and fluffy), but the pancakes were a huge bust for both of us. They were way too dense - the texture was pretty awful. I'm assuming that's how all their pancake batter is, so I'd hard pass on pancakes there. \nIt was fun to venture off the Strip, but we'll probably stick with breakfast elsewhere in the future. HOWEVER, they offer an extremely generous military discount of 30%, which we appreciated. We didn't even ask for it, but when I opened my wallet, she noticed my military ID and offered it up."

Other than that, the restaurant was lacking and not worth the trip from the strip. Just FYI, these Egg & I restaurants are independent from one another as I heard the staff tell another customer.\n\nMy wife and I went on a Monday morning. The reviews said their would be lines, but we encountered none. \n\nWe got a variety of food. She got coffee, pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey ham.  I got OJ, hot tea, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and turkey sausage (they only have patties in turkey sausage).  \n\nShe said her coffee was good, the eggs were as expected, but nothing spectacular, and she liked the turkey ham. The pancakes were not cooked all the way through. She ate about 1/3 before she got to the middle to discover the undercooking. The restaurant offered to toss them back on the griddle, but she declined as she wanted to eat my potatoes (which were very good).  They brought out a chocolate muffin to make up for it. It hasn't been eaten yet, but I suspect it's pretty decent. \n\nAs for my food, the potatoes were really good! Like really good.  Well seasoned and smaller and crispy, the way I prefer them to be. My wife liked them as well.  My turkey sausage was  undercooked and cold when served.  If you like hot tea like me, savor your first tea bag, because that's all you'll be getting for the $2.50 it costs to get hot tea. And perhaps it was my mistake for ordering biscuits and gravy; as a southern man, maybe my standards are too high. The meal was reminiscent of what you get at a Holiday Inn continental breakfast in the south. Seriously, no joke, and I feel bad about saying it like that, but it's true. The biscuits were hard and as if they were precooked and then microwaved when the dish was ordered. The gravy was ok, but nothing special. \n\nOverall, with the cost of breakfast, plus the uber there and back, it would have been just as cheap to do the Bellagio buffet and gotten better food and more options."

Flip from a black to a yellow egg as an indicator that you're ready and a server would be at your table in no time. I found it unique and utterly adorable. \n\nAfter taking a while to eye the vast newspaper style menu, I got a huge portion of tender country fried chicken served with over easy eggs, home fries and their iconic banana nut muffin while mommy got the chicken, broccolli and mushroom skillet. It was the best thing that happened that morning. \n\nA point to take note of; the skillet is blanketed with a layer of cheddar cheese (wink to the lactose intolerant).

Since we're at a timeshare I'm enjoying making breakfast most of the week.  On a lark I decide we're going out, and I google \"best las vegas breakfast\".  #1 on the list is \"The Egg and I\".  So we map it and off we go, without a lot of expectations or knowing what's on the menu.  \n\nSo first of all there's a bit of a wait - 15-20 minutes for a table.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, and every table is filled.  We are seated outdoors on the patio and there are heaters set up (the stand-up propane ones) every couple of tables so we're nice and cozy.\n\nCoffee comes and guess what - it's really good.  I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic - I roast my own beans at home and can distinguish varietals between African and South American by taste - and it's surprisingly lively on the palette for a breakfast joint.\n\nBetween the four of us, we order a vegan breakfast, two different omelets and biscuits and gravy.  Each entry is under $10, and the portions are absolutely ginormous.  It's a quarter to midnight and I'm still stuffed.  \n\nBut most importantly, every thing on the plate is absolutely delicious.  From the specialty omelets to the potatoes to the gravy, everything is simply first rate.  \n\nApparently the place has won several awards and is Zagat rated.  I have no reason to doubt any of this - if you're in Las Vegas for breakfast, you absolutely MUST search out and try The Egg and I."

The service is extremely friendly.  Our coffee was lukewarm and they immediately brought out a fresh pot and continued to apologize when I didn't think it was a big deal.  No charge for substituting hash brown patties for potatoes.  Perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs.  delicious, buttery toast.  I have no complaints about this place!  It's just awesome!"

But, you need a mode of transportation because it's not on the strip.\n\nTIP: If you check in through Yelp, you get free of the delicious, moist Banana Nut Muffin. (Do it! It's worth it.)\n\nBe prepared to wait in line before seated, ALWAYS busy. So don't come here starving because you'll end up hAngry. \n\nFOOD: I love everything I ordered from this place. Oh, if you eat like a bird, share The food with someone because they serve big portions. (My son and BF always finish their plates though.)\n\nThey also have rice plates, 3 choices, Hawaiin style. YUM!\n\nDRINkS: Mimosa is not unlimited. But soft drinks and coffee are. Also if you order juice, they'd give you a carafe.\n\nPRICE: decent price. They accept Amex. Pay at the cashier once you receive your receipt. \n\nRESTROOM: small but clean. \n\nSPACE: big space, good for groups. They also have outdoor seating.\n\nSERVICE: fast (once seated) and efficient friendly staff."

We arrived about 15 minutes early so we reviewed the menus as we waited. We were given an 8-person table in the back corner of the restaurant.\n\nAfter being seated I notified our waitress (larger woman with Hispanic accent) that two members of our party were not going to make it so we broke the tables up so more people could sit. Our waitress was helpful in executing the table move without any impact to our comfort. Throughout the meal, our waitress provided us the best service possible, despite the busy conditions of the restaurant. \n\nThe wait for food was nothing extreme and actually pretty quick considering all the people eating there. The food itself was fantastic. Most people at the table did not even finish their plates. My friend ordered the omelette with mashed potatoes....sounds strange but I tried it and it was amazing. \n\nIn the end, everyone from my group was satisfied with their meal and especially with the service. Egg & I seems like one of the go-to places for breakfast in Vegas. I recommend it for anyone...just come early or call-ahead if you have a large group of people."

We decided to check this place out after reading the glowing reviews on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.\n\nWe arrived around 10:15am on a Sunday and the place was packed! There was a line outside the door of people waiting. However, the wait was quite fast and our party of 6 was seated in about 20 min. The service was excellent - our waitress Alexa was super friendly and took our complicated drink and food orders with ease. Any one with a Yelp account can also check in to receive a free banana nut muffin, which was huge, warm, and full of banana flavor. It was one of the best banana nut muffins I have tasted. In addition, coffee comes with unlimited refills! \n\nOur table ordered:\nBacon and sliced avocado omelette ($11.25): excellent. The omelette was huge and stuffed with ample chunks of whole avocado, bacon bits, and topped with a generous amount of melted Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. There was also a side of buttered toast and a choice of home fries, cottage cheese, or fruit (I think this is offered with any egg dish). Delicious, and a large portion size for one person. \nHeart stopper skillet special ($10.25): this was my favorite dish that our table ordered. It was one of the specials and consisted of a layer of works potatoes topped with bacon, ham, and sausage and smothered in homemade country style gravy and two sunny-side up eggs. The gravy and the runny egg yolks mixed with the potatoes and meat created a delicious creamy explosion of flavor and umami. \nSouthwestern Cobb salad ($10.50): a huge salad with a ton of toppings. I was impressed that there was very little lettuce, and instead a lot of delicious toppings such as taco seasoned chicken, black bean and corn relish, tomatoes, black olives, bacon, cheddar cheese, tortilla strips, and a whole sliced avocado (amazing!) with chipotle ranch dressing. \nSundance special omelette ($11.25): veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Swiss cheese topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. You can also add chicken for an extra $2.50. The feta cheese melded perfectly with the creamy egg flavor and the various vegetables. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place for brunch. Service was super friendly and efficient, and the food is great value for the portion size and the price!"

The service was pretty good - it was packed but it seems the staff actually pays attention to the system of \"frowny egg\"/ \"happy egg\" because when we put the frowny egg on for more coffee, people came immediately.  \nThe second day I got the prime rib benedict but with guacamole instead of hollandaise sauce.  That was awesome!  They were actually too generous with the guac and I had to leave some behind on my skillet.  Service was again pretty good, but we got the same waiter who remembered us.

That's why this is so frustrating. The server came and took our drink orders. Then he took our food orders. Then we waited and just when we started to get a little antsy, they came out with one plate of blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon. (Not for the same person.) The rest of us continued to wait with no word from our server or anyone else. The pancakes were gone and still no one else got food. Then they came out with a second plate of blueberry pancakes; not the plain ones that were ordered. Four other orders came out shortly afterward. Two from our table continued to wait for their food. The server came by twice and assured us the kitchen was fixing the orders. The rest of us were finishing our meals by the time one came out. It was wrong and was sent back. Several minutes later, the correct order came out. The seventh person was still waiting for his plain pancakes. When they finally came out, they were blueberry and undercooked. He was so frustrated and hungry, that he just ate around the blueberries and batter. At this point, FINALLY, the assistant manager comes by...with our check (with the two messed up meals taken off), a weak apology, and a loaf of banana nut bread. I pointed out that I never received the banana nut muffin that came with my meal and the assistant manager brought out another seven muffins for the table. As much as we appreciate and enjoy the banana nut muffins, they can not make up for the frustration from our experience. That it took that long for a manager to approach us and apologize is seriously disappointing. That he could give no reason as to the horrible experience was even worse. We were left hanging for most of the meal with no explanations and no assurances. I don't think any of us will return to this location again."

Oh man, I knew I was in for a special treat because clearly this is popular breakfast spot in vegas with all the wonderful reviews here on yelp and zagat reviews.\n\nwe both went with the egg white western omelette's, ham, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. we both were given a complimentary banana nut muffin since it was our first visit..and the husband loved it and i thought it was OK.  the breakfast arrived and everything tasted wonderful and was prepared the way we requested (we asked our omelette's to be cooked with pam spray vs butter-and they were happy to oblige). service was great and fast.  I would definitely return to try some other breakfast items."

It is now crowded and thefood taste so manufactured.\n\nWhat keeps me coming back is breakfast with the girls, the banana nut bread (OMG, it's SOOOOO good), and the ranch potatoes.\n\nDuring the weekends, the wait is up to 30 minutes. The staff is super friendly, they are great at keeping your coffee cup full. Also, what's cool is that when you have an issue or need something they have an egg on the table, you can flip it to reveal a sad, yellow egg. Someone is usually at your table within 30 seconds. It's like they have sonar for these yellow eggs.\n\nThe Egg & I serves breakfast and lunch and they close at like 3 PM."

The menu is huge and appealing that none of us could make up our minds on what to order. Eventually we did, 2 friends got the eggs Benedict and pancakes, another got the steak and eggs with rice and I got the spinach and avocado omelet with fruits and I shared the strawberry creme french toast with a friend. The ambiance is like any ordinary breakfast joint with that \"home\" and \"granny's house\" feeling. \n\nEveryone loved their foods, but it was so much that they couldn't finish it except for my friend who got the steak and eggs. I for one cold not even eat half of my food, regardless of how delicious it is....and I can eat a whole lot. I loved that my omelet was full of fresh huge slices of avocado and spinach inside my omelet. The fruits were fairly fresh and sweet. My whole plate cost me about $118 with tip so not bad considering I had a yummy Easter omelet, fruits and a huge delicious stack of french toast. Sadly, none of us took our food to go because we were on the road doing errands that day. \n\nNext time I hit up Vegas, I'll be sure to come here for breakfast!"

Immediately you will notice a group of people waiting patiently outside of the restaurant for the next available seat. When I go, being a smoker, I usually go out on the patio to enjoy the fresh air and a smoke with my coffee and book. The staff is so welcoming. I am a frequent visitor so they know where I would like to sit, escort me to a table of my choosing, provide an ashtray, and offer the heating lamp if it is cold outside. Always friendly, you are not just communicated with by your server, but others in the staff that notice your presence. Nobody walks around with blinders on. You feel as if they are there to enjoy your breakfast with you. \n\nSpeaking of the breakfast; it is the best in town! The wait is never long, and the food is always fresh and hot. Makes one wonder what kind of army is stacked away in the kitchen. Spinning out plate after plate of unique dishes that dont only taste great, but are piled high on your plate, makes me want to walk into the kitchen and give its staff a huge hug. There is something on the menu for everyone's taste, and, unlike many chain breakfast places who will remain unnamed, you actually get fresh ingredients, and flavor without frou frou toppings of berries and whip cream to try and doll it up. I find myself looking at others plates and wondering what they are having with delicious anticipation of trying it the next time. My signature dish is Brads Special, and I almost never stray from a favorite, but the fact that I feel safe to do so at The Egg and I says a lot.\n\nA pleasant \"hello how are you\" greets you at the door, and a friendly \"Thank you, have a nice day\" assures a future visit. If The Egg and I added a few floors atop its building, and offered rooms like a Bed and Breakfast, you better believe there would never be an available occupancy."

Took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience. \n\nIt's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. Popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. Luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. Good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.\n\nCountry style atmosphere and d\u00e9cor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. Both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. Old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. Prices are reasonable and large portions. I highly recommend trying their famous banana nut muffin. OMG, so good! Super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. I got mine free with my Yelp check-in. You can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entr\u00e9es for a muffin. \n\nWe ordered \"The Works\" scramble, Fresh Veggie omelet and the Hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. Everything was fantastic! Served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. It's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with hash browns and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. Enough for 2, I literally devoured everything and no regrets. I loved the taste and texture of the hash browns, lightly crisp and tender. I usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. Of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? Simple Hawaiian-Pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. Just the way us locals love them.\n\nMost of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. Egg and I was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. Service was excellent too. Our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. Still thinking about those banana nut muffin. Looking forward to coming back."

This is a locals eatery.\n\nI ate the standard, eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, and hash browns. On the menu it is called \"Eggs - Plus\". I added the sausage \u00e0 la carte.

These were the square pieces of potato type of hash browns. Usually this type of hash browns is greasy, heavy, and dense. These were light, airy, and had some type of paprika seasoning.\n\n The toast was the best I ever had. Light and fluffy whole wheat bread.

It was a huge portion of eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage goodness.  This was probably the tastiest thing on the menu, and I had only a bite.  Definitely something you can share if you're not too hungry.  Great service and good value for the dollar!\n\nEgg & I, I will be back!"

And she started off by saying she was going to take a couple of dollars off the bill for making us wait for 35 minutes. I have no problem waiting for good food.

When I go on trips that involve Vegas, I've started planning the itinerary to let me go to Eggs & I for breakfast. It is a slight trek from the strip, but totally worth it.\n\nFor my most recent visit I got the Ensenada Burrito and my wife got the Banana Bread French Toast. The Ensenada Burrito was a recommendation from my server Amanda and I'm so glad I listened to her. The burrito was delicious. Tasty meat and eggs in the burrito and topped with a healthy amount of cheese. Plus, it came with a side of their potatoes (what they call habla diablo seasoned potatoes) which are some of my favorite breakfast potatoes. So good. My wife's french toast was sweet and delicious. The service was top notch. Amanda (our server) was cheerful and seemed genuinely excited to help us figure out what to eat.\n\nOh, and they have this black/yellow egg heads on each table to notify the staff if you need help (Black smiley face = you're ok, Yellow frowny face = need assistant). The staff watches this like hawks. Each time we flipped it, a staff member (not just your server) is right there to help. We were in a rush and needed the check... flipped it... 5 seconds later a staff member was there... 30 seconds later our server gave us our check. It was awesome.\n\nOverall, I can't say enough about this place. It is one of the best breakfast places in Vegas (if not THE best). The wait is quick, the service is great, and the food is top notch."

The servers are always smiling and genuinely kind. They are constantly concerned about your food and if everything is tasting good. \n\nFOOD: 3 - My disclaimer: I really only came here to eat eggs. I did not want any meat other than bacon. I strictly came here for really, really plain ol' breakfast food, and not anything else.\n\nI got a really boring item called \"The Classic\", but I really wanted just eggs and bacon, so that's what I went with. My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. I mean, they were absolutely perfect. Some cooks leave the yolk barely runny on the inside, but they are experts at eggs here..and I have no complaints. \n\nThe banana nut muffin was soft and moist, but I just didn't like the taste of it. I think I'm just picky, but the banana in the muffin tasted a little ripe. The potatoes were good, but they weren't great. The bacon was a little overcooked and a little too hard for me. \n\nI totally forgot to check Yelp before ordering, but next time, I'll order a healthy omelet and see how that goes!!"

The menu itself was very extensive from the benny's, omelets, crepes, pancakes, waffles, etc. I honestly felt getting my monies' worth from the Works Omelette that it filled me up. If you haven't been here while you're in Vegas, you're definitely missing out! It's a place known for it's breakfast and just open during breakfast and lunch hours."

Not just because the food is great and the prices are fair, but because we have the most amazing waitress on the planet, Karla. We are even willing to wait longer, in order to be in Karla's section. She is always friendly and is a great waitress in that our order is never wrong, our drinks are always full to the brim and she eve has time for a little chit chat with us to catch up! Egg and I is definitely one of our favorite breakfast places to dine at, but what makes our breakfast the best is having Karla (who is truly unique) wait on us! She literally has become just like a member of our family! Make sure next time you are there that you ask for her, she was also awarded by the mayor of Las Vegas, NV for her skills!"

I should have questioned it when it was dropped in front of me but I normally eat my first meal of the day around 6am. It was 12 noon and I'd not yet eaten so I just ate it. 1/2 way through I realized that this was not anything close to traditional corned beef hash, especially of the homemade variety. Homemade hash to me is chunks of fresh cooked corned beef and an equal amount of potatoes, all mixed not pureed together. \n\nI can't fault the staff as I said above. They do a great job of making everyone feel welcome. And I could tell people around me were enjoying their meal. I would love to give them a better rating but this ain't my mama's hash."

If you are waiting in line, check out their menu cause they have a LOT of choices. \n\n3. Wear a sweater/sweatshirt - I know were in Vegas but the place was blasting the AC. Even our waitress had a sweatshirt on. \n\n4. Order a banana bread muffin, its moist and fresh and a great snack. I ordered one after our meal because I was stuffed from my plate \n\n5. If you know you can't eat a whole plate of food, get the HALF order. Of course our waitress told us AFTER we finished. \n\n6. The pancakes were the best part of my meal - order them! Only complaint was that they served it with that fake syrup. (I'm from the East coast, I'm a little spoiled)\n\n7. My sister didn't really care for the cinnamon toast french toast - they didn't look that great either\n\nIt was a solid breakfast for a lazy morning, I think next time I would try one of their egg-dishes since they are called Egg & I \n\nYELP 365: 163/365"

I am use to eating corned beef out of a can where the meat is more like ground beef compared to this place where the meat is shredded, and oh man that was awesome. So as you can read, I ordered the corned beef hash which does come with 2 eggs made whatever way you'd like, some pretty good, crispy, special seasoned cut potatoes, and a choice of a banana nut muffin or toast of choice. The waitress was nice enough to pass out free muffins for everyone, the muffin sounded good and everyone at other tables had them, but in actuallity it was only ok. I probably should have went for the toast, but looking at my friend's toast, I will say that they put a lot of butter on it, so if you don't want that shit, make sure to tell them, because I don't think they'll tell you. Oh also forgot to mention that the order also comes with two random slices of fruit.\n\nI actually felt a tad overwhelmed, not by the meat, but the potatoes, while great, it was just so much starch to digest, but non the less, it was still satisfactory and the flavorings in each bite were awesome. \n\nService was awesome but paying at the end seemed to drag because we had to wait in line to pay at the register....but regardless, I would definitely go here for breakfast if I ever wake up in time during my Vegas trips."

She was polite and friendly. Im critiquing the food and food only. The country fried steak itself was delicious....well cooked, crispy and seasoned perfectly....the gravy was rich and creamy. The eggs were extremely overcooked and potatoes were ok......the spice on them were a little too overbearing for my liking. Overall flavors were good......steak was the standout.....eggs not exectued well and the price.....a couple dollars higher then id like it to be. Not a bad experience, but there are too many good places in Vegas"

The dish consisted of eggs over medium over a layer of sliced chicken fried steak on top of a layer of potatoes all smothered with a coat of gravy. \n\nI love greasy and unhealthy foods in general but I am starting to think that my taste buds are slowly changing.  The meat was dry and salty.  I had to continually dip the chicken in the gravy to get some moisture and to mask the salt away.  The potatoes were even worse.  They were doused with a heavy coat of seasoning salt.   I considered wiping each piece of potato with my napkin so that they would be edible.\n\nI drank a lot of water that day.\n\nI do want to mention, however, that service was nice and my wife enjoyed her huevos rancheros.\n\nOhhhhh... Banana nut muffin was quite good.  It was moist but not very fluffy.    My new old man self suspects that something not too healthy was used to get it that moist.  Sometimes not knowing for sure about something like this is better."

I could completely fold it taco style because it had no \"crisp\" to it at all (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dk70gFzNfCOjgd3aN7N0_w/l.jpg).

After trying it once, myself, my wife and my 2 daughters never even thought about going anywhere else.\n\nIt's not very often that you can't find a single thing wrong with a place like this, but honestly, from the food, to the service, to the fact that it's ultra family-friendly, the little egg signs on your table that the servers use to gauge if you require service, to the cleanliness and finally the price of the place - it is all simply outstanding.\n\nWe were served 3 times by Erin and by the 3rd time she'd already started calling us all by name and my two young daughters were made to feel like royalty with all of the attention that was lavished upon them. In fairness, all of the servers were extremely good, quick, attentive and extremely understanding (my youngest daughter is a very fussy eater!!).\n\nAll the food is cooked absolutely perfect. I know it sounds like a stupid thing to say, but they really can cook an egg (pretty lucky, considering their name). This wouldn't be a big deal, but the amount of restaurants you go to that can't actually cook a simple egg is enormous. Not here though - I didn't go a single day without some kind of eggs on my place. Also, the fresh coffee is as good as you'll get anywhere and is a perfect complement to the food. I can't imagine not having eggs and coffee for breakfast every day for the rest of my life!!\n\nI should also give a quick shout-out to the Egg & I banana nut muffin. My wife and kids absolutely devoured these day after day and all 3 said they were the best muffins they had ever tasted - a big compliment coming from my wife!\n\nTo sum up, this is Las Vegas' premier breakfast joint. No if's and but's. It's impossible to go away disappointed and if you're anything like us, you'll be returning day after day until the day you leave Vegas!"

Much much cheaper to eat at than on the strip.\n2.  The drive is close by from the Stratosphere.\n3.  Portions are VERY generous and filling.\n4.  Service is outstanding with many smiles (thank you Amanda).  =)\n5.  Hot sauce selection extends from regular tabasco and tapatio (thank goodness!).\n6.  Saturday mornings are a little less crowded than Sunday mornings.\n7.  Homemade banana nut muffin.\n8.  Parking in a shared lot.\n\nBIG TIP:  Be sure not to wait until 10:30am to get up and eat here or else you will be waiting.\n\nSo why leave the strip to come here??  To be honest, I wanted something good for also a good price.  You know that dry, empty feeling you get from some run-of-the-mill restaurants?  That breakfast where you are happy that you ate it, however, it just settles in your stomach because it has to, not because it wants to?  Exactly!  Here at Egg & I, you get breakfast that is prepared with meaning and with purpose.  Wonderfully filling and satisfying."

Sooo glad we did, because 1, they weren't as big as we thought they'd be, and 2, those suckers are really tasty.\n\nThe stuffed french toast is to die for.  Seriously, I think it'll kill you with all the meat, cheese and butter they manage to stick in there, but it's definitely worth the extra trips to the gym to work it off.  It's a pretty huge portion when you add in the home fries. The previous reviewer that said that it looks like somebody dumped a bottle of Lawry's seasoning on them wasn't kidding. They were orange.\n\nSO got the Mexican Omelette and she couldn't finish it because of the generous portion size, but she enjoyed what she was able to put away. We both enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice.  There's nothing like seeing some honest elbow greased pulp in your juice to let you know it's the real deal.\n\nGreat service, friendly atmosphere, plenty of parking.  We'll definitely drop by when we're in the area again."

First thing I have to mention is the banana nut muffin.  Yes, I know everyone mentions it but it is SO worth mentioning!  It's so moist and delicious, I actually now crave the darn thing!  \n\nI ordered a corned beef hash with eggs and instead of their potatoes, I ordered rice.  The corned beef hash was okay, I like mine on the crispier side but it was still good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Not too many places can make the perfect over-medium where it's a little cooked but just enough runnyness to get some yolk without it spewing all over the plate like an over-easy.  I tried my girlfriend's potatoes and should've stuck with it.  It was almost like little bites of french fries.  SO delicious!

It's was decent and the home potatoes were good and well seasoned. \n\nI didnt like the eggs Benedict as much as my friend but the potatoes and the free banana muffin was good. Warm and put some butter on it. \n\nShout out to Oscar for the good service and win the trip!!!'"

We had a party of 3 and waited about 10-15 minutes before we got seated. My friend ordered the stuffed french toast, which was HUGE! The bf ordered the eggs benedict, which was not bad and good portions. I ended up ordering the egg-crepe, which was simiar to an omelette. Pretty good and not too heavy. \n\nWhat we loved the most was their banana nut muffin and ranch potatoes. O man, my mouth is watering just thinking about how light and tasty their banana nut muffin was. I could eat like 5 of those in 1 sitting. hahaha. =X We were all raving about how  the ranch potatoes were so flavorful. Plus, each dish had a big portion of it. I definitely wasn't complaining. \n\nOur waitress was very attentive, but not over-bearing. She told us if we needed something, we could just flip the little egg over to get her attention (reminded me of Bubba Gump's).\n\nI will definitely want to come back and try other things on the menu, since I go to Vegas about 3 times a year."

This shows she likes to interact with the customers. She also was attentive and came by to ask how things were or if we needed anything. The service in general is excellent as we always had a rotating staff to help with clearing the table. \n\nI'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes."

'Cause the reason it was long to get a table was the fact so many others were waiting before us, 'cause the food and value is pretty damn good.  Truly I should give it five stars. But life isn't fair, so they get four.  Notwithstanding I was standing for about 30 minutes before getting a table.  Why was I standing? I'm a glutton for punishment.

Service was fast, waitresses were kind and quick. Husband ordered the hash skillet it was amazing, like, mouthgasm amazing. When it came to the table it didn't look like it was going to be that good, but wow. I ordered a chicken fried steak breakfast with over easy eggs, gravy was portioned well, not overly done, steak fried perfectly, not greasy, but crispy even with the layer of gravy. Their potatoes are pretty interesting diced/cubed with like a season salt, have a nice crunch to them. The portion sizes here are absurdly large, I think we could've easily shared one of these breakfasts plates and been satisfied. We both weren't able to finish either plate. They also come with a side of toast or a muffin. Only downside I'd say is the coffee price is a bit on the steep side, but they do leave you a jug, at your table so you don't need to flag someone down and you're supplied with all your needs at your table."

All the good reviews kept this place on my radar, so when a friend wanted to try somewhere new, we came here. \n\nThe wait was not bad at all - especially because as we waited, we had the menu to look over and wow, there are lots to look. Eggs benedict, omlets, pancakes, skillets and more. \n\nToday, I went with the Crazy Chicken Omlet (\"you're crazy for not trying it\"). It's a plateful - so much so that we got a box to enjoy it later. \n\nOutstanding service - They even have happy/sad face eggs you can display on your table to signal for service\n\nI would probably come here again and again to try the rest of the menu."

I looked on yelp for a breakfast joint and found this. We walked in and asked if we could sit and eat within an hour. And the host said we could if we sat outside (since everyone wanted to sit inside because it was a bit chilly that day) so we sat outside... ordered quickly... i had the flapper ( eggs bacon and pancakes. ) My friend had the burger . And the other two had biscuits with gravy. Everything came out very fast. We couldnt belive it.also... Crystal was the best server!! She was constantly checking on us and made sure we had everything we needed. So back to the food. OMG. My food was good. But my friends burger with fries was amazing!!! And the biscuits with gravy! But that burger.... lol. Maybe I was a little hungover.. but it was so juicy.the bread was not your typical diner bun. Also the french fries were the match stick kind with great seasoning.. only thing I would recommend is that they mix plain fries with these seasoned match stick fries ... I found myself fighting to eat all of them because It was a bit salty. Other than that I will definitely come back when I go on my weekend getaways to vegas! :)"

HOLY COW.\n\nfriends wanted to try this for lunch when we were in the area and i had high hopes for this place. wait for a little over 10 people was a long wait as this place is super busy. once we got seated we noticed the place was packed and our service ended up being horrible. i guess they utilize these egg signs on the tables to indicate if we need help or not and look. we were the unhappy eggs of the place. sat down and ran out of menus. we waited for over 10 minutes then got menus. after we all decided what we wanted to order it took another 10 minutes to get someone to help take our order. the guy who took our order kept hitting my friend's chair as he took his order over 20 times. after we ordered our food took an okay amount of time to come out. once it came out no one could eat because they ran out of utensils and he had to ask wishing a 15 minute period three different waiters to get us utensils (how long could this possibly take?) then we ate our food. EVERYTHING WAS SO SALTY.\n\ni had the burger and fries (i know who gets a burger here but its what i wanted and when you have such a large selection it truly suffered). my burger came WITHOUT onions. i was confused had to ask the waiter if they give onions and he was like they should. patty was cooked with no seasoning at all. bland. tomatoes were frozen. nothing special on it like damn i know its a plain burger but its so bad... NEVER GET THE BURGER. fries were the most salty thing I've ever tasted in my life. like wow. I'm a person who licks my plate clean and i didn't finish this plate at all. biggest waste of my money. i tried my other friends dishes and we all agreed all the dishes were salty. not acceptable.\n\ndon't recommend unless you want salty ass food for days.\none star is just for the free yummy banana muffin for checking in..."

We called ahead to see our wait time and they offered to put our name down, so by the time we arrived half an hour later, our tables was all ready for a group of 15 --perfect! Our server was also super sweet and constantly checked on us while even offering everyone in the table a free banana nut muffin. I did claim the Yelp check-in for the free muffin, but she was kind enough to just give everyone in our table one. What was even more wonderful was that one of our party members is allergic to nuts, so they gave her a blueberry muffin in replacement.\n\nFor food, I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Skillet with sourdough toast ($10.25). I also shared with the boyfriend as he got the Stuffed French Toast ($9.75). When you're ordering here, I know your eyes are going to speak louder than your stomach, but I can guarantee that you'll be stuffed by the end of the meal. I highly recommend the Stuffed French Toast. It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet with a sausage, cheese and egg mixture folded between french toast. The syrup it comes with is lightly sweet and simply tastes amazing altogether. Of course, you'll end up a little sticky but it's worth the battle. Their potatoes are no ordinary potatoes either. They give you a plate full of potatoes covered with cajun seasoning --so delicious! Not to forget the skillet I ordered, because that was very tasty as well. They melted so much cheese over my potatoes, which was my favorite part. I only had 1/4 of the skillet and was too full to continue.\n\nWhen paying, we always struggle with a huge group. They have you pay up front and were very patient to help us easily sort each order and pay efficiently. The service and food is seriously on par here, love it."

My cousin told me about the Egg & I.  Boy am I glad that he did.  The food was really good.  There was a 10-15 minute wait but did not compare to those monstrous lines in the casino hotels.  \n\nAfter glancing through their newspaper styled menu, I decided to have a four egg omelette.  Which was more than delicious when it arrived.  Accompanying this wonderful omelette was their famous ranch potatoes.  These bad boys were orgasmic good.  They were seasoned with some spices that gave it a lil bit of a kick.  But if you aren't into spicy then I advise you put some ketchup on them to dull the fire.  All in all the meal was delicious.\n\nThe service was pretty good as well.  They have a system where there is a napkin holder and on top are two pictures of eggs.  If you need some assistance then you just flip the egg to yellow.  Now I may be butchering the explanation of this process but long story short the wait staff is very attentive and helpful.\n\nSo give it a shot if you are tired of long buffet lines.  It also gives you a chance to see the other parts of Vegas."

Come ready to read & eat because you have a massive book of a menu to study before making a tasty decision, which you really can't go wrong.  Everything is very good, but very different with generous blends of ingredients.  Def not your normal boring breakfast foods.\n\nSo, if you're not awake and not ready to study the menu, use the random decision making method by closing your eyes before opening the menu to a any page and ordering the first item your finger lands upon.\n\nYou always have the choice of warm, fresh banana nut muffin or toast.  Let me repeat -- warm, fresh banana nut muffin, ahhhhh.  Just about everything on the menu is served with their yummilicious ranch style potatoes.\n\nMy favorite thing here is the Pesto Scramble (4 eggs scrambled with sliced chicken, pesto, tomatoes, spinach, and feta cheese.)  My other favorite is when they have the Country Potato Soup special, which is a creamy potato soup topped with lots of chives and some bacon.   It's not a regular menu item. \n\nThe wait staff is consistently great.  Prices are great and portions are generous.  If you come on a weekend day come early or call first.  Sometimes there is quite a wait to be seated during late morning."

Arrived early afternoon, there was pretty much no wait, even though there were some customers lingering near the entrance inside and the place was still full! Service was extremely down-to-earth, friendly, and attentive!\n\nThis place has a huge menu (in the form of a \"newspaper\"...if that gives you some idea). There were so many choices it was really hard to decide on just one =( The variety is vast, but the bulk of the items were simple, straightforward, typical breakfast dishes with unique modifications/twists or add-ons. My husband's chile relleno omelet was such a great idea for an omelet...the juicy chile and the cheese tasted amazing wrapped in egg! My benedict's garden (vegetarian version of egg's benedict) was superb as well. Even though one of the items listed in my dish was guacamole, I was SO pleasantly surprised when it arrived NOT as guacamole, but pretty much a whole avocado sliced up!!! You don't get that often, even in California! +10 points for that! The whole combination of poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and avocado was such a delicious creamy mix, and perfectly-balanced by the crisp freshness of the tomatoes. I basically devoured it in under 5 minutes...and then had to wait for the husband to finish his plate *rolls eyes.* We both agreed that their seasoned potatoes were freaking AMAZING. We don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it reminded us of Cajun and it was to die for. I wish they sold it by the bottle!\n \nWonderful place, with reasonable prices (total with tax came out to be $27) and a great cup of coffee as well. The awesome staff makes it even better!"

Everything was yummy including the home made Banana Nut Muffins and we took a few to go.  Good place for breakfast, nice menu selection and Carole Ann was a great waitress.

I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed!  I like how they give you a carafe of coffee when you order a cup (like IHOP) so you don't have to constantly wait to get refilled.  Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.\n\nAs far as the food, it also met my expectations.  I decided to try the egg-ceptional omelet (has bacon, mushrooms, ham, peppers, onions and sour cream) and not only was it delicious, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  I wanted to try the pancakes as well but I couldn't get it as a side so i tried the banana nut muffin that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but I'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.  \n\nThe overall price was reasonable and I prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the Egg and I is one of the best breakfast places around Vegas.

I had the pumpkin pancakes (which are not on the menu, so ask) which were so delicious that I didn't even need syrup. \n\nMy wife, who I love so much (just in case she reads this), is a finicky eater, and she wanted to come back the next day before we left (which we did). She got the skillet breakfast both times. Word to the wise, get a half order if you're not a big eater.\n\nOne last thing, went with friends so I tried the biscuit and gravy, stuffed french toast and two different skillet breakfasts. I would have been happy with any of these other orders. \n\nOk, I lied, this is the last thing, try the Habla Diablo verde on your food, it is very tasty. So much so, we bought a bottle to take with us."

It gets pretty packed during the weekends, especially with big parties, so be prepared to wait! But if anything, the food is worth the wait.\n\nThe selection of different types of dishes included dozens of omelettes done all kinds of ways, eggs benedict, eggs florentine, egg crepes, skillets, and i could go on and on because they also have sandwiches, french toast, and seriously I can go on.. \n\nI got the ham and mushrooms skillet with blue berry muffin. The muffin was moist and fresh! The skillet was their infamous ranch potatoes topped with ham and mushrooms with a layer of melted cheeses and two eggs done however you liked. Honestly, it looked super huge and I thought I would not finish it, but it was so good I annihilated that sucker!  My friend tried the ultimate skillet which had ham, bacon,  sausage and other goodies, but he said that it was waaaay too many things going on in one dish. So unless you like something super hearty and packed, try the ultimate skillet, if not, choose one or two ingredients to put into it.\n\nService was super friendly and kind. On the table there are these flip cards with a happy and sad face. Put up your happy face is your party is doing fine, but if you need anything put up the sad face and a server will attend to you quickly.\n\nWhen I come back to vegas, this is a definite visit, especially after a big hangover!"

We enjoyed our food and both finished it in no time. \n\nWill definitely come back. \n\nOur server Erin is very upbeat and personable, made our dining experience a little extra special!"

Found Egg and I in a coupon book given to us at our Hotel. \n\nLocated in a strip mall with a lot of parking, there was no wait on a weekday morning, but the place was full of patrons. Took a while for our server to take our order and asked us twice what we wanted to drink (amnesia maybe ?..no she was just busy, trying to tend to everyone), so after about 10 minutes, my husband flipped the sign with the un-happy egg, to show we needed attention. The sweet lady at the register quickly came to us and asked what we needed. Our server quickly came to us and apologized for the wait and also brought each of us the BEST BANANA  NUT MUFFIN ever !!! \n\nI had the Blackend Prime Rib Benny, A Grilled croissant with  prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. Also came with home fries and 2 slices of fruit. This dish was AMAZING ! All the flavors tied together so well and that Banana Nut Muffin will make me a return customer ! The hubby had Crepes filled w/ Mushrooms, that I take was also delicious, since  I didn't get to taste it ! \n\nThe coupon for a \"buy one meal get the other for half off\" made the whole experience even better.\n\n We'll be back in 2 mos..EGG AND I but this time we won't be alone."

We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. \n\nWe got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. I ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. I feel like I might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. \n\nAftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes I decided on the chicken fried steak skillet since I am a big fan of all things chicken friend. The 3 others got the Mexican omelet, I believe that is what it was called. \n\nThe food came out pretty quick, first glance at my chicken fried skillet made me queesy but I was hungry and I thought it can't be that bad. The country gravy was gelatinous. It was weird. Like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. Whatever. Give it a try. \n\nIt didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. It was very salty and I just couldn't get over the slime gravy so I stopped eating. Everyone else with their Mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. Apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. My partner is Mexican and loves her spicy foods. She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. \n\nAnyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. \n\nAs you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. Never again."

The day before my lady had found a voucher in a tourist magazine together with the notion of a review that this place (i.e. both) we're very liked with the community and the reviewers, in fact best liked.\n\nBeing a no brainer it turned up trumps in reality: The place was VERY busy (which we took as a good sign to start with) yet being seated only took a moment and the service was very fast and attentive. Food variety on the menue is almost too big ;-) so I quite took my time to decide. Got an italian influenced omelette which turned out to be very tasty. \nOne more thing about the service: Our little boy didn't like his fries because they came spiced (paprika or the likes)... they were replaced with plain ones in no time - comped !\n\nA little before the food arrived a nice and cheerful lady of the staff came over and chatted us up a bit. Her expert eye didn't fail to note that we were out-of-towners. Later, I found out that she was actually the manager (owner?) and had the same first name as my darling ! When she heard that I failed to order the banana nut muffin (house specialty) she had one sent to our table immediately - again, complementary !\n\nI guess I don't need to say more. Prices very reasonable, yummy food with a lot of variety...wish we had breakfast places like that in Berlin lol.\n\nSince I guess we will return to Las Vegas at some point in our lives I can clearly see us going there again !"

There were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too. \n\nService:  not the best service I ever had, but not the worst. Doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing.

We ordered the \"Chili Relleno Eggs Benedict\" special, and we got the \"chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and banana nut muffin.\"  \nThe muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  Would have been perfect if they served some butter with it. \nThe Benedict was good. I love the chili taste that cut the richness of the Benedict. \nThe chicken fried steak was good, but not the best I ever had. It was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. I really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  When they first came out, I thought I wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.

I wish I could remember our waitress's name to give her a 5-star review. The service is definitely what would keep me coming back. The food is good, but the pricing was a bit high (I think bennie + coffee came to $14 + tip) to make it a regular go-to breakfast."

I was visiting Vegas with family and actually craving pancakes, but I couldn't eat at a place called \"The Egg & I\" and not have eggs.  So I ordered a simple breakfast the Eggs Plus (over easy eggs, grits, toast, and bacon).  I had never seen such a perfectly cooked over easy egg, and it definitely tasted that way.  The white of the egg was so airy!  My mom was willing to share a bite of her eggs benedit, and they were soooo good!  I felt I had to commemorate the visit, so I bought my mom an \"Egg & I\" coffee mug.  :)  Oh, and the staff was very friendly."

I ordered the veggie good omelette.  The yummy omelette (I requested mushroom, spinach, and cheddar on mine) came with well-seasoned potatoes and their infamous banana nut muffin.  You must try their banana nut muffin!  It was probably the best banana nut muffin I've ever had and I'm not exaggerating.  It tasted like there was a slight hint of buttermilk in the muffins but whatever this restaurant did to them made them amazzzingggg.  \n\nAll the portions sizes are huge and I liked how I could easily substitute items that were orginally in the veggie good omelette to make my order just the way I like it.  Great prices for what you are getting as well.  The atmosphere is also fun and filled with egg puns!  Egg-static!"

This place is roughly 10-15 mins away from the strip so there was no wait like all the other crazy famous Vegas brunch spots and that's 10 extra bonus points!\n\nLike I mentioned I'm a crazy egg person so ordering brunch was never difficult for me. I would always always ALWAYS order an omelette but no joke, it took me more than 10 mins to decide what I wanted here since almost everything had eggs in it and there were so many choices! But of course i ended up getting the work omelette and we also ordered carnitas something (I was so hungry and forgot to note the name). The omelette was okay nothing special or different for everywhere else but the potato on the side was AMAZING! The other dish was also super good- I've never had carne asada that's so flavorful and delicious! I cannot wait to come back again and try the other dishes they have!\n\nOh did I mention, instead of stretching your neck out to track down your waiter/waitress, you can flip the \"egg sign\" and someone will swing by to attend to your needs.

At Barstow you get out your phone and you begin to review the non casino options in Las Vegas when 'Egg and I' leaps out with these great reviews and a fantastic star rating.  Sold!  That's where we're going to go.\n\nWhen we check-in on yelp we get a free Banana Nut Muffin, and things seem to be fantastic.\n\nOur server is charismatic, checks in often, provides us with a pitcher of water (its something like 100 degrees outside and rising), and was efficient throughout the meal.\n\nOur omelettes arrive in a timely fashion, and so what is their to complain about.  \n\nFirst, I like cheese, and so having cheese is always a good thing, and for you this may be a big plus, but there was so much cheese it was hard to taste anything else.  I had ordered the chile rellano omelette, and it arrived as advertised, but with just a ton of cheese.  \n\nSecond, the potatoes looked to be cubed by a machine, frozen, de-frosted, and then lightly seasoned prior to arrival.  They were very disappointing.  \n\nThird, my expectations were way too high.  My fellow yelpers love this place, and so I was expecting this amazing breakfast that just didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd probably go back, but with a whole different set of expectations, knowing that I'd ask for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes, and I'd probably not choose an omelette.\n\nBe sure and check in, a free muffin is not a bad thing."

The flavors were spot on and the side of potatoes were nice.  The banana muffin that is served is awesome too.  It's probably microwaved before getting to your table but it's still very decent.

But with the bright lights and a full schedule of gambling, shopping, and drinking you definitely need to start your day right with the most important meal of the day--breakfast. Egg & I is a local favorite and contrary to the restaurant's name they do serve entrees san eggs. *gasp* \n\nThe offering:\n*Reuben Sandwich w/ Fries: The meat was perfectly seasoned between two toasted slices of bread. mmMmmm... Oh and they gave an extremely generous offering of french fries. yum yum! \n*Fender Blender: Some type of egg and crepe contraction which was light fluffy and all around delicious. It came with an asian-inspired sauce which complimented the main course perfectly. Oh and the potatoes were spot-on!   \n*Florentine Omlette (Daily Special): Ironically the daily special was not special at all . Instead it was a complete epic fail in my party.  Way too cheesy as the produce was drowning in the gooey sea.   \n\nThe food is great, the price is right ($8 average entree), and I'm definitely coming back!"

I decided to order it anyways though I wasnt sure about ordering a item at a non Hawaiian spot. It was actually really good, even better than most of the fast food style Hawaiian places as everything tasted much fresher and the gravy had good flavor. \n\nThe fiance got a apple walnut chicken sandwich which he seemed to enjoy.

I really liked our server as she was just chipper. \n\nIt's always busy here so I avoid the peak times to not have to wait, but if you go later in the afternoon like we did, there's no one there. 1 hour wait for breakfast time or no wait for breakfast at lunch....I'll pick the no wait! \n\nIt's been a long hiatus, but my next visit won't be so far off again."

            "review": "I wanted to try something new for breakfast. I had no idea where to go or what to eat. I came to Yelp like I normally do. Mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and I packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nWhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. I sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that I could park. As soon as she walked in, she called me. She said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. Nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. So, I walked in to wait.\n\nUpon entering, I was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. I just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. Surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nThe place is really small and packed to capacity, so I was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. We had plenty space.\n\nThe server came around fast to take our drink order. She was quick to bring our drinks back too. She asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"No, we're looking at Yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" I did ask about the stuff French Toast dish that someone shared on Yelp. She smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. Then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nAs soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. When she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. We went ahead and ordered. It totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. The waitress said, \"You were on Yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" I was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nShe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. I don't even like banana nut muffins but I took it anyways because it was free. I took a bite of it and fell in love. It was so warm and yummy lol. My friend got emotional lol. She said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. They were just delicious.\n\nAbout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. I order the Stuffed French Toast with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. It also came with seasoned potatoes. It looked incredible. My friend ordered the 2 pork chops that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the seasoned potatoes. Her's looked delicious too.\n\nI LOVE potatoes so I ate those first. I put ketchup all over them and had a ball. My friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. I put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nNext, I started in on my French Toast sandwiches. I didn't like the sandwiches. The sausages, eggs and cheese didn't have much flavor. I thought I made a big mistake. Being that I'm so smart, I thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the French toast and season the filling myself. I did, and it was 90% better. I ate the filling separately, and ever so often, I would dip the French Toast in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nMy friend said that the pork chops were Just okay. They were really thin, for sure. I don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. I wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and I took a bite of hers. They tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. She was right. They were just okay. She did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nThe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. I'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nThe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. I asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. I guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. I didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and I didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nBut also, I took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once I had actually finished it. It took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. We just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. When she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. She came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. We were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. I'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nAlthough I'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, I probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average."

Within 15 min the wait turned into 30-45 min wait.  So if you're going to check this place out come early.  First time?  No problem, you get a warm banana nut muffin. Regular, check in with yelp and get a free muffin. Lots to choose from. The portions are big enough that you can share with someone else.  Shane was our waiter ABC be was so nice! He recommended the rib eye benedict. So good!  It comes with home potatoes that are seasoned to perfection. The Mexican Crepe (made out of eggs) is pretty good to.  My boyfriend and I shared the rib eye benedict and the biscuits and gravy. Come on an empty stomach, trust me. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and eager to make your experience a pleasant one.  This one is definitely going  in my book as one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for breakfast!"

Yes there were people waiting outside to eat due to this place being so popular for breakfast.  The wait was 15 minutes which wasn't that bad.  I tried the waffle works, which consisted of a huge Belgian waffle with 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs.  I did request whipped cream on the waffle, which made it taste even better.  The waffle was huge.  I enjoyed every bite.  The portions were very generous for the price.  Worth every penny.  The server Lindsey was wonderful and made sure I had the meal of a lifetime.  \n\n     The Egg and I taught me a lesson that the best places to eat are not always on the Strip or Downtown Las Vegas.  There are good places to eat all over Las Vegas and you have to dig deep into your soul for the best food possible.  The Egg and I has a small town feel to it which provides an intimate dining experience.  This is one of the few places in Las Vegas you can eat at everyday and not get tired of it but wouldn't do so simply due to the fact that you don't want to spoil yourself.  This will become my new go-to spot in need of a good breakfast while visiting.  As far as the food quality and atmosphere goes. the Egg and I destroys Denny's and IHOP by all leaps and bounds imaginable."

I tasted from everyone's respective egg plates and they were all amazing. I believe there was a Vegetable Skillet and a Little Piggy at the table and those were divine.

I was told I could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. This is the first time I have run into this problem. She also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register. This turned out to be a fustercluck and inconvenienced the customers behind us at the register. The CFS itself was good, as were the potatoes. The eggs were eggs.

In our dysfunctional state of mind, we decided we wanted brunch.\n\nOff to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper! \n\nChicken Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! \n\nRanch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.\n\nBanana Nut Muffin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!\n\nEggs Florentine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!\n\nCoffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. \n\nHuge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =D"

The menu is pretty huge and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I ordered the Fiesta Skillet with chorizo. The eggs were really good, but the chorizo left something to be desired. It probably wasn't the best item on the menu, but this particular morning I was feeling something Mexican inspired. The ranch potatoes were great, like little cubes of goodness.  And yes, the banana nut muffin is as good as everyone says it is.\n\nCome here if you're looking for good breakfast with generous portions at a decent price. I definitely would consider coming back here the next time I'm in Vegas."

Meh.\n\n Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.\n\nTo be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.\n\nIf you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.\n\nThere are fine dinner restaurants off the Strip as well!  Yelp is here for you."

The coffee is pretty plain and is really the only thing that could have been better. With that being said, it was a diner so the coffee was on par for what I expected. The service was really good. I like that there is a sign that you can flip up for when you need service. It's nice not to be bothered every couple of minutes. Look for the waitresses wearing a button on their uniform declaring that the owner was right! (sorry, I forgot his name) As the story goes, when a server leaves egg and I to go work somewhere else he tells them they will be back. When they come back they have to wear the button! Lol"

The eggs were cooked perfectly, the maple cured bacon was bacony delicious, of course.  Hash browns were in patty form, but tasted lovely, and the pancakes were of the sort that I just plain love.  \n\nThis is honest food, cooked presumably with grease and butter, and is just plain good.  \n\nThe menus look like they are styled a bit after a newspaper, which is new and lovely.  This establishment has something The carnivore has never seen before.  Each table has a device on it that shows an egg with a happy face, or an egg with a sad face.  One is yellow, the other is black, and this means that your server can tell at a glance whether you need her for anything.  Every restaurant should employ a similar device.  \n\nAmanda was our waitress.  Yes, the Carnivore still uses the words waitress and waiter.  He also will not apologize for this, or stop doing it.  In any case, Any case, Amanda was on point for our whole visit.  All questions were answered promptly, food came out superfast, drinks were topped off without any wait, and she had an infectious smile.  She either loves her job, or should move to Hollywood.  Mrs. Carnivore and I would be delighted to have her wait on is at any establishment.  This level of service is truly rare in today's world."

We got it off of the Triple D website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. While it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:\n\nMy mother and I both have a food allergy to Monosodium Glutamate more commonly known as MSG. It is a flavor enhancer/ preservative often found in foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). For me, a little is OK, but my mother can't eat it at all. \n\nWhen we sat down at the table, we asked if they used MSG more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? Our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. My mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated Chicken Fried Steak, had to change her order. Both of chose the Sunrise Mountain and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the Habla Diablo potatoes that came with 90% of the breakfast options.\n\nWhen the food came out it looked delicious, but one bite changed our opinion. While it was plentiful, it was bland. Even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.\n\nMy father, who does not share my MSG allergy, ordered a skillet. Mom and I both took a bite of the Habla Diablo potatoes from his plate and they were delicious. Crunchy and flavorful, I would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing MSG. And the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).\n\nI gave this place two stars because the service was good and the banana nut muffins delicious. Now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals..."

The Egg & I is not to far off the strip, only about a mile depending on where you stay.  We took the back roads from Caesars and our ETA was about 5 minutes. \n\nThe coolest thing is their \"happy egg, sad egg\" stand at the edge of the table.  Whenever you need something like a drink refill, or if you have a problem with anything, just flip the egg from the happy black face to the sad yellow face.  We tested this unique method of customer service and within seconds we had our waitress back at the table asking if we needed anything.  Even without flipping the egg the waitress was very attentive.\n\nAfter you get your drinks the waitress will bring you a fresh baked banana nut muffin.  My buddy thought he was flirting with the waitress, and they totally were, so he made us all thank him graciously for the 2 muffins.  Then after 30 seconds of looking around, you realize everyone gets a muffin.  *Sad egg face Jordan, sorry :^(   But the muffin is warm and delicious.  \n\nWe had a party of 4 and we all got something different and it was all great.  I got chicken fried steak covered in gravy atop a mound of ranch potatoes with 3 fried eggs on top, and the best part about it was... they CUT it up for you!  This is when I found out I am lazy because you know you're lazy when you get excited about your food coming pre-cut.  The chicken breast was moist and the outside was perfectly crisp, and with every bite the batter unleashed a flurry of flavor.  Mouth watering.  The hype about their ranch potatoes is true.  They are really good and live up to the expectations other yelpers have set fourth.  I haven't had anything quite like them ever before.  My plate also came with a side of fresh seasonal fruit and a biscuit for gravy dunking. \n\nThe rest of the gang ordered: eggs benedict, the breakfast burrito, and a plain jane 2-egg breakfast with bacon.  All of which was worth the wait on a Sunday morning.\n\n5-Stars for the overall experience.  The waitress was cute and friendly even if she didn't give Jordan a muffin because he was \"special,\" their happy egg / sad egg system works well when you need something in a pinch, the superior quality of the food and the prices are great especially after losing a couple G's at the tables in Vegas."

Searching yelp one morning and looking for something else besides hash house and denny's / ihop / buffet i came across this.  And wow.\n\nThis place feels homey. Decor is really cool with western american style wooden tables and chairs that didn't come off too tacky . Plus outdoor seating and this place is slammed on a Friday morning? Must be a good place. \n\nLooking through the menu, my eyes caught a special that was simply prefect. Chocolate pumpkin pancakes. The waitress kept talking them up after i ordered so i was excited but gave a negative vibe to my friend, making him feel like his dish wasn't as good ( he ordered the Mexican style omelet ). Coffee here comes in a carafe making the experience pretty top notch as coffee goes quick in my breakfast meals and i always feel like i am always trying to get more refilled.  The pumpkin chocolate mix in my pancakes was awesome and hands down the best breakfast i had in Vegas. The egg's here are epic. One side order came with a lot of bacon which looked lost in the eggs. The eggs and bacon were a course of their own.   Tried a little of the Mexican omelet it was good too.\n\nHonestly for the cost of the meal and added experience it was a honestly my favorite breakfast throughout whole  trip. Next year I am going to come at least twice when i visit."

I'm not sure if they sprinkle their eggs each with individual cartons of salt...wouldn't be surprised cause everything was so salty. The hollandaise sauce also had an overbearing flavor and the ham was so. damn. SALTY. Everyone at my table was commenting on how salty the egg dishes were.\n\nI really wanted to like this place because the servers were all so kind and attentive but my egg dish pretty much ruined it for me. The potatoes on the side however were prepared perfectly. Crispy and perfectly seasoned. \n\nNevertheless, I did enjoy the free banana nut muffin that came free with yelp check-in. Probably one of the best muffins I've ever had. Warm, toasty on the outside & moist on the inside. Mmmmm.\n\nHad a small portion of friend's stuffed french toast which was pretty good. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but since this restaurant specializes in \"egg works\" I was not expecting to be let down by a classic eggs benny dish. I would give 5 stars for service and 3 for food."

And let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.\n\nI can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...\n\nSuper awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! I've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no complaints. I've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. Stop in and give it a try!"

That is, it is a fun place to eat if you can get a table as they are oftentimes very-very crowded -- especially in the morning.

Plus, the food is very Americana. Basically, what you see is what you get. \n\nOrdering is easy. As the name of the restaurant suggests, it is eggs and things that go along with eggs. Simply as that. Make your choice and you are all good. \n\nThe staff is always nice and helpful is you have any questions. And, most of the times the other guest are nice though I have been here a few times when the restaurant was deluged with a rowdy or rude crew, however. But hey, this is Vega, what can you expect? \n\nEggs & I is attached to a large shared parking lot.

We had breakfast there twice over a recent trip to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My first meal was the Ultimate Skillet. Bring a large appetite! My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and all the ingredients were so tasty and fresh. I also enjoyed their sourdough toast. It was thick, flavorful, and buttery! The dish was so yummy and substantial.  It kept me going until late in the afternoon. My wife had the Bacon, Avocado, & Cheese omelette. She loved it. It was cooked to perfection; a uniform yellow color and cooked evenly through.  It was loaded with lots of avocado.  She said that it was maybe the best she's ever had. Wow!\n\nI had to cut back on my next visit. I ate too much on the first one, although I really enjoyed it (trying to be good in Vegas???). I ordered the Eggs-Plus with ham. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right.  The ham was good. It was not dry, chewy or too salty. The potatoes were also good. The server helped my wife make substitutions to the Flapper which made her her happy. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too? She rated the pancakes 5 stars!   Another great breakfast.\n\nI must commend the staff here. They are welcoming, friendly, and they are willing to accommodate you so that you are satisfied with your meal. I am looking forward to my next Vegas trip so that I can eat there again."

I hope everyone who was injured in this moronic act a speedy recovery. I also hope they are able to be fully operational again ASAP (if not already). \n\nEgg & I is located minutes from the strip on Sahara. I believe their other restaurant goes by the name of Egg Works. This restaurant is open everyday but only between the hours of 6am-3pm. We got plastered the night before and somehow were able to wake up and drive our zombie behinds to eat here the next day right before noon. The wait wasn't too bad considering the restaurant isn't too big to begin with. \n\nOur server Jacky was a sweet heart. She was uber friendly and attentive even when it seemed like the restaurant was chaotic. How many other tables did she have with a bunch of hung over dudes, possibly acting a fool beats the hell out of me. She was holding it down like a seasoned veteran. She started us off with that infamous banana nut muffin. This is not to be missed especially with a cup of joe.\n\nNot going to lie and say that this place serves health conscious types of food. They may have some \"lighter\" dishes but the menu is dominated by heavy hitters. Everything we ordered was either smothered with country gravy or had some sort of heavy but tasty sauce. We thought of this great game plan to all order our own entrees and add an extra French toast plate to share amongst the five of us. Bad, bad decision. One entr\u00e9e is an adequate amount of grub. Anymore, you may want to check your blood pressure.\n\nThere are plenty of choices on their menu and as you can imagine, numerous egg inspired dishes. From skillets to classics, you'll find something for everyone. I had the Country Benny, you can look it up yourself. Let's just the menu states, \"This one's a heart stopper.\" Need I say more? That dish was good but I also hated life afterwards. No regrets, it was delish while I was conquering that beast but just be ready for the consequences.\n\nEgg & I is definitely a hit. I can see why locals and tourists flock to this establishment. We ate here and I had to immediately go back to our hotel to pass out and recover in time for night two. Only in Sin City..."

I noticed on 4 different occasions of them taking food orders to incorrect tables.\nAside from that the food was awesome.

Told the wait was about 25mins, which it was. Staff were friendly and appeared to be much more efficient this visit. The wife ordered breakfast, Chicken Fried Steak and it was very delicious! I had the beef dip, which was average at best. The beef and au jus just didn't have enough flavor and the fries were soggy. So, I'd say 3 stars this visit, close to 5 the first, would be an easy 4 overall.\n\nOn sunday this place was literally a zoo, people packed everywhere, kids screaming/crying, rude people in the parking lot.

So, for example, we both ordered ordinary hash browns instead of the potatoes \"diablo\" (or something like that).  The hash browns we got were clearly pre-frozen patties - not quite as good as the ones you get a Trader Joe's.  My stuffed french toast, and my wife's eggs benedict were very ordinary.  And the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range.\n\nI can't see any reason for us to go back to this place.

The service (my server was Stacie) was very fast and friendly and they have a funny colored egg sign on each table that you flip over and your server will come running to get what you want. I had the Classic 2 Eggs with Potatoes and Ham Steak and it was soooo tasty I was in awe as I was eating it. Each potato seemed to be individually seasoned!  Their coffee was also much tastier than what you'd expect and I would say its as good as the brews at The Coffee Bean and Starbucks. Well done Egg & I, you're exceptional!"

Was going to get the stuffed \nFrench Toast, but I love a good omelet.  Just okay here.  Home-style potatoes were good, though they tasted like they had been sitting in the warmer instead of freshly made. Not really large portions.  I did enjoy the banana nut muffin and got one to go.  A friend had huevos rancheros and he really liked it. \nWould I go back?  I doubt it.  Too many places in Vegas that have better service and better food.  Maybe the lunch is better. Maybe if I were a meat eater.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Oh well.  But for me, if you want a place that has better ambience, HUGE portions and a menu that is like a book, go to Hash Hash A Go-Go."

We wanted EVERYTHING!  I went for the Piggy Skillet and was absolutely overwhelmed.  It was fabulous.  My husband and I were so pleased with the food and service, we made sure this was the last place we ate before leaving town.  And I took a banana nut muffin on the plane home.

The average breakfast is about 10 bucks and 3 more for coffee. I would say sharing is a must!!! The omelets were super cheesy but tasty. The Cajun potatoes are awkwardly addicting. At first bite they taste over seasoned with cajun powder but by the end of it you will wish you had more. The banana nut muffin comes with your entree or free check in on foursquare. It's definitely not the best muffin int he world like others claim, but it is tasty. However, eat it hot or it might taste dry. And eat it with the butter then its perfection. Overall with sharing, free extra muffin, and two iced coffees and tip it was 23 dollars. Don't know if I will be back as there is too many other places to try."

You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.   \n\nThey do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.   \n\nMy good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.

Our server Perry was right there ready to take our orders and food arrived shortly afterwards. \n\nWe had the prime rib benny, grandma's biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash and Island Favorite.

For those who like flexibility, these guys entertain reasonable substitutions!  \n\nI just happened by this place on a Saturday morning.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table, which can be an annoyance, or it can be an excellent endorsement for patience.  My wife had a four-egg multi-cheese omelette, and tiny as she is, she ate every bit, washing it down with coffee (that was attentively refilled!).  It came with choice of potatoes and a super-delicious muffin.  I had a specialty omelette that was filled with spicy veggies and cheese.  When it came time to kick the spuds to the side, the waitress offered fruit, tomatoes, or fruit and tomatoes!  The fruit was chosen, fresh, sliced, and nicely arranged.  I had the coffee too, and the waitress was never stingy when more creamers were requested.  Such good service.  I can see why this place has people waiting for a seat.\n\nThis place has the best egg-dish menu I've ever seen.  The price of most dishes is in the $10.00 or less range.  They have plasma TV's strategically placed on walls, so you can watch sports if the conversation crashes.  It's all good. This is the best non-buffet breakfast I've had in Las Vegas."

It's one of those bfast places where there are mugs on the table and the server brings you a giant pot of coffee and leaves it with you at your disposal.  There were different types of pre-packaged cream and sugars, including hot sauces, ketchup, and a little egg sign which you can flip over if you need servicing.  Not as ingenious as the button at Korean bbq places, but it works!\n\nMost entrees come with a side of toast or homemade banana nut muffin.  I'm not a big fan of banana nut but my god, theirs is just divine. Spongey, soft, moist, slightly sweet and with just the perfect flavor of fresh banana flavor and a little hint of crunch from the nuts.  The nuts aren't bitter either, as some walnuts can be and it was just pure perfection.\n\nBH and I went a little buckwild (as we always do) and we ordered three dishes: eggs benedict florentine, a half order of corned beef hash, and the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon.  The benedict was awesome and was smothered in creamy hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were soft and runny but the English muffin was still crispy and chewy.  The stuffed french toast was pretty good.  BH gobbled up the entire plate whereas I had just a bite or two.  I thought there was too much egg and not enough bacon, but BH told me it was great with maple syrup.  I like sweet meats and breads, but I haven't gotten accustomed to sweet scrambled eggs yet, so I never tried it dipped in sticky sweet maple. Finally, the corned beef hash was very fresh and I could definitely tell it was homemade and not from a can.  The chunks of potato were creamy and starchy while the chunks of meat were flavorful, salty, and a little reminiscent of dog food (but in a good way).  The over easy egg on top made it even more delectable.\n\nFinally, one of the best parts of the meal, besides the banana nut muffin, were their ranch potatoes.  They are roasted to a perfect crunch and seasoned with some sort of red powder - possibly paprika for a bit of smokiness?  They were so damn good, that even past my stuffing point, I kept stabbing at the potatoes so I could get every last bit in my mouth.  Needless to say, BH  and I were nearly bursting by the time we left Egg & I.  I call that a sign of good breakfast and a good start to a day."

One of the most innovative breakfast menu's I've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  Service was outstanding, our waitress, Jessica, was fast and efficient.  \n\nThe feature here is undoubtedly their banana nut muffins.  They were excellent, rivaling the best homemade I've ever tasted.  What amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   They were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  They have a slight gingerbread taste to them so I suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   I know how much work they are to make homemade which is why I really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    The food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with bananas in it.  I feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three banana muffins- mine, my son's, and a free one as a YELP check-in bonus.  I carried two out and enjoyed them later in the day.\n\nI had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  The potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  My son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  A nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the Vegas temps and low humidity.\n\nIt's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in Las Vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip."

            "review": "My sister and I had been pretty excited about coming here after reading all about it on Yelp.  It seemed to be really busy with lots of people waiting outside (on a Sunday afternoon), but we luckily only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated.  \n\nOur server was super nice.  She really helped elevate the entire experience.  When we asked for banana nut muffins to go with our entrees, she asked if it was our first time there.  We told her yes and she said the muffins were free for first timers!  Hope that's true and I'm not getting anyone in trouble by posting that info here.  \n\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine & it came with those little (obviously frozen) and highly seasoned potatoes.  Overall I enjoyed the dish, but there was so much Hollandaise sauce that the English muffin got pretty soggy and the ham was really quite bad.  It was cut in thick slices and was very rubbery.  It almost tasted canned or something.  I took the ham off and it was much better that way.  However, the whole thing was a runny, saucy mess.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly though.  My sister unfortunately didn't enjoy her blueberry pancakes too much.  This might sound strange, but they were way too fluffy for both of us & just didn't taste that great.  We both loved the muffins though.  That very well may have been the best part of the whole meal.  \n\nDespite the rubbery ham, I'd definitely come back.  The service was excellent and I feel confident that we'll both be able to find other dishes on the menu that suit us better.  Plus.... those banana nut muffins!  You'd be a fool not to try one."

We were seated within 20 minutes, got our asked for drink orders immediately upon being seated, and waitress took our orders as soon as we were ready.\n\nWe went to breakfast because my dad loves breakfast (and so do I, but not as much as him). He got the biscuits and gravy meal (as he does at most places). I got stuffed french toast, which means eggs, meat, and cheese inside.\n\nI ate past the point of being full, while still leaving a little on the plate, and my dad finished his pretty quickly because it was so good. He said as we were walking to the car, \"That's about as good of a breakfast as I've ever eaten.\" That's a top-level compliment that he doesn't use lightly.\n\nIt's about $8-10 for most meals, service is great, food is even better."

The last time I ordered the Chile relleno omelette, it was delicious! I liked it more than the Bandito. it came with a banana but muffin, which I finished even I told myself to fight the temptation. my kids ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast, I forget the name of it but it was stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries. they wanted to lick the plate.

We were seated immediately for a group of 5 at 1pm on a Sunday, but that was just luck as it was a full house. \n\nThe menu is huge and a little overwhelming because there are so many options, but I finally settled on the Huevos Rancheros with carnitas, both sauces, and breakfast potatoes. I also used the Yelp check-in for a free banana nut muffin, and she kindly brought one for each of us at the table! The muffin is so moist--we're talking stick to your fingers moist. Our meal came relatively quickly and there was silence among the table as we all dug in. The huevos rancheros were probably among the best I've ever had. It came with so much carnitas and melted cheese--it was exactly what we needed after two days of Vegas, if you catch my drift. I was wary of the breakfast potatoes initally; I'm a hash browns girl precisely because breakfast potatoes are often underseasoned. Not the case here in the slightest. Each nugget was a little crispy, but soft on the inside and packed tons of flavor. The portions are huge though, so keep in mind when you're ordering! I split the huevos rancheros and it was more than enough for two!\n\nMy friend got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were also very delicious, but super thick and rich so not what my dehydrated body was in the mood for. Gimme dat salt!\n\nRight before we left we were commenting on how good the muffins were, and she brought us two to go in a box because they were about to close up for the day and they make them fresh every morning. I will definitely keep this place in mind next time I'm looking for brunch in Vegas!"

They offer breakfast sandwiches, french toast, egg bennys, OMELETTES, specialties, and more. I went for the chile relleno omelette and I'm SO glad I did!

It's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nWe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nOur waitress was Chance and quite honestly one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. She was also VERY attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nFirstly, as I said before, it's busy. But you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. There's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. If the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. I never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nFirst thing I loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. You're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) and cream at hand. \nI usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and Chance was eager to help. She told me about the Chile Relleno Benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. Honestly, I'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and I went ahead and ordered it. \nIt was amazing. And it SHOULD be an everyday menu item. I'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nChile Relleno Benedict:\nWow. The dish was amazing. Benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. REALLY well thought out and balanced. First thing I noticed was that the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. The whites were soft but not slimey or runny. There was zero cooked yoke. It was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \nI don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the Chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) chicken breast. The breading was really what made the dish I think. It added just enough saltiness that I didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. I always add salt and pepper (unless I get chicken fried steak) and that was a pleasant surprise. The chile and the chicken were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. There were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly I would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. It was really that good. \nMy GF ordered the veggie pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. I didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. I DID sneak a few fries however and loved them. Thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. Another instance where salt was not necessary. Really they would have been fine without ketchup. \nI fully intend on visiting this place every time I head to Las Vegas and can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you Egg & I for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!"

I'm so over the pricey and mediocre food at the buffets on the strip for breakfast. So we came here based on the yelp reviews.\n\nFirst, they have a huge menu, which makes it hard to decide what to get in the first place since I love all breakfast foods. So I went basic with buttermilk pancakes and eggs and bacon. Everyone's eggs were cooked perfectly. Bacon crispy as I had requested. Short stack of 2 pancakes was more than I could finish. My husband and a friend each got some sort of skillet concoction, and I probably didn't finish my pancakes because my fork kept was always in his skillet because it was so good! The four of us were all pleased with our meal.\n\nThe place is busy, but we were seated after about 20 minutes. Service was good, portions were large and a reasonable price. I would probably come back to this place next year on our annual trip!"

I added spinach to the breakfast burrito and it seriously looked like work of art when it came out, you could see the layers of bacon, cheese, eggs, spinach and potatoes. The salsa that came with the burrito was the best salsa I've had in a while and of course the Diablo potatoes are addicting. The pancakes were moist and fluffy. So much yummmm!"

The crepe was huge, it too up half teh dish, but was more like an omlet than a crepe. Still tasty and filling. \n\nI like breakfast and I usually get a chicken fried steak for breakfast, but that crepe was definitely a head turner walking in to our seats... I'm sold on Eggs and I."

My brother didn't think it was a good idea so I went back and they had no problem noting we wanted to sit inside. It's busy but people go in and out quick. We waited for about 5-10mins. \nAs usual we got seated, got menus and they asked for what drinks we wanted. So far so good with service with Amanda. She took our orders and talked a little to my 1 1/2 year old niece. Drinks came out quick. The banana nut muffin that came with our meal came out as well and it was so delish!!! My daughter and I got one each and we saved one for later. We didn't want to get full so we shared one. \nOur food came out. I had the corn beef hash with the side of potatoes. Potatoes were good. I don't know why I got the corn beef. I'm not really a fan of it but it got a lot of reviews. My daughter ate half of her omelette and saw a hair in it. We bothered one of the servers about it and she took it back and made my daughter a half order of the same omelette. Almost done with our meal, they forgot to t bring out the banana pancakes my bro ordered. We reminded them about it too. \nThe lady that took back the omelette came out with a complimentary plate of these banana bread with custard filling goodness. She probably gave it to us because of my daughters omelette and forgetting the pancakes on time. Omg! It melts in your mouth!! \nI love this place and they have the best customer service. Especially when it's crazy busy in there. When they brought out the pancakes, they told us they did not charge us for the omelette and pancakes. How awesome is that?? \nThey're super nice!

Today, I just wanted to give a couple of shot outs to Brady, the Assistant Manager, and to Jesus, whom I discovered is a 20-yr  employee of the Egg & I. \n\nJesus is a busboy. On my last two visits prior to the one I'm writing about (this past Monday, Memorial Day), Jesus has asked me if I needed anything to let him know, which he did again on this visit. Jesus is ALWAYS willing to help, and has gotten me coffee, filled my coffee and even scored me an extra banana nut muffin or two before. Not really his job, as his is to clean tables and make sure their customers have somewhere nice to be seated, but Jesus ALWAYS goes above and beyond what is expected of him to do, and I appreciate his hard work.\n\nWhich brings me to Brady, the young Assistant Manager. Brady is definitely young enough to be my little brother. Brady is a genuine, bonafide talker. He shoots the shit with you, but real talk. Not fake talk like I'm only here to make it look like I care about you talk, but good ol' fashioned back and forth banter. He has a tattoo on one of his forearms that says \"Family First\", and Brady made me feel like family! While shooting it with him, I told him that we had just come from Laughlin but had to detour cause one of my wife's uncles fell ill and ended up in the hospital and guess what Brady did? He sent me home with a loaf of their bomb ass banana nut bread to take to my uncle at the hospital since I told him that's where we were heading after breakfast! THANK YOU AGAIN BRADY! I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS!\n\nI'll end this review with a little bit about the food.........my Italiano skillet was on point, AS USUAL. Onion, bell pepper and sausages were all cooked to damn near perfection, it had just the right amount of marinara and cheese that didn't drown or overwhelm, and to be quite honest, have they every messed up a batch of their famous potatoes?"

The waitress was patient and friendly outgoing and concerned about the service she provided us. The other patrons in the restaurant were professionals and a delight to be around. \n\nThe restaurant was clean. The service was great!\n\nIf you come to Las Vegas you should check this place out. I am going to return before I leave."

But they have a lot of tables and the food comes out relatively fast, so you don't wait hours and hours. If you check in, you get a free muffin- which is amazing to munch on before your meal comes or after on your drive back home :P\n\nI only eat from the breakfast menu and the selection is immense!\nYou need to just commit and order. \nThis is where we come to de-brief on what happened during our Vegas trip lol."

She was the perfect      host, and made the experience great. (she gets 5 *+ )\n\nDay 2: Never got the servers name( skinny preggo chick), she never came buy often, and when she did, she would completely forget about stuff we asked for. The guy next to us sat there for a good 20min before she took his drink order, and even longer to get him his meal. I had asked for a refill of water, and she seemed to bring water to everyone around us, except for me. The she abruptly brought us our bill that we had not asked for , while we were still eating, and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. Oh yeah I still hadn't gotten my water, so I asked her again and finally as we were getting up to leave, she brought water. \n\n\n\nOverall, This is a MUST when I'm in Vegas."

My asked the waitress could she speak to the manager these 2 women. I thought she would ask the two women to leave considering they had not even placed their orders yet and where disturbing the other patrons.

The waitress did a excellent job explaining the menu to me and letting me know how I could customize my order. Everything I asked for was promptly brought out.\n\nWhile not the best sausage gravy I have had in Vegas, it was still decent on it's own and still better than most of the sausage gravy I have had in Vegas. Nice amount of sausage throughout with a nice homemade flavor. I do believe it was made in house. But it still had the consistency of being out of a packet. The biscuits weren't as soft and tender as I would have liked, but still passable.\n\nThe bacon I got was on point. They were straight and crispy. I asked for the eggs to be extra soft. They were okay, but it was weird, the top half of the pile was cooked how I wanted, but the bottom half was cooked hard. I'm  guessing they were left on too long and not continually scrambled. \n\nAll together, I enjoyed my meal, but I am still looking for well made biscuits and gravy in Las Vegas. I will come back to try other items on the menu."

They're sooo delicious! I really like he seasoning they use on them, and I think it makes it different than the same ol' potatoes you would get anywhere else. \n\nThis is very much like a diner that you would go to back home, and this is off the strip so the prices are reasonable too. \n\nWill definitely return!"

I went with the country fried steak, which had the perfect combination of crispy and tender. I'm more of a hash brown fan, but their cubed breakfast potatoes were very tasty. And I have to pay tribute to the banana nut muffin; I don't even like bananas, but this was fantastic. To top it all off, my server Staci was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Highly recommended."

It was light and fluffy and the banana flavor was subtle. \n\nThe corned beef hash comes with ranch potatoes (think Tommys style fries with that red seasoning only diced up), eggs, and a side of watermelon and pineapple. The hash was served under scrambled eggs in a skillet. The ranch potatoes were crisp and flavorful. I just wish the hash was a bit crispier. Since the hash was made with a mixture of potatoes, the texture remained soft and did not create any contrast with the scrambled eggs. It had good flavor though. \n\nLastly, the customer service is top notch. All the waitresses were happy to help and near the end of brunch, the owner/manager came over just to chit chat, which I appreciated."

The service is also pretty bad. When we arrived the hostess seated us at a  with unraveled silverware and a five dollar bill still sitting on the table. She gave us our menu's and left the money awkwardly sitting there. \n\nWhen we finally got to put in our orders our waitress recommended that we take a half portion of our cheese, egg and veggie skillet breakfast dish and I'm so glad she did. The half portion was like a full portion and I could barely finish it, as it had so much thick sticky cheese on top. Also, the seasoning that they put on the potatoes tastes exactly like Dorritos and I felt like I was eating potato chips (not in a good way). \n\nAlso I just wanted to note something that happened while were waiting for our food to come. The waitress hastily sat us at a 5 top (it was just my bf and I). A family of 5 came in about 10 minutes after us and she tried to sit them in the table next to us which could not accommodate anymore than 4 people. She grabbed a chair from our table to try and seat them there, but the family was really unhappy, it was especially awkward as we were sitting at the only table that could fit them. She then moved them somewhere to the other side of the room. I saw the family leave a few minutes later out of frustration. \n\nThe food is really just standard fare, nothing to write home about. On top of that it's incredibly unhealthy. I understand that Vegas has very little breakfast joints, but I would rather make my own omelet at home. Your health will be better for it."

I love off-Strip, local establishments where I can get my grub on, and this is definitely on my list now. \n\nI intended to get my butt up at 5 am and be at their door at 6 am when they opened, but my brain determined I needed sleep more than food and I ended up putting my name down at noon-thirty, at the height of brunch/lunch time. I was told the wait was about 15 minutes; I waited a solid 20 (which isn't bad when \"15 minutes\" usually serves as code for half-an-hour) and was promptly greeted by my wonderful server. I had my food about 10 minutes after I placed my order.\n\nMy late uncle was a gourmet chef, and my earliest, fondest memories of Vegas revolve around eating his cooking. Biscuits and gravy were on the usual menu when my family and I made our annual road trip out here, and I have purposely shied away from ever ordering it because nothing could ever come close.\n\nBut, for some reason, I ordered it anyway here. Was it as good as my Uncle Ray's? \n\nDoes the free show in front TI have anything to do with pirates anymore?\n\nExactly. But that said, I would probably order it again. I regret not remembering my server's name, but she's one of the best I've had in a LONG time, and as someone that waited tables and bartended her way through school, my standards of service are ridiculously high. She was awesome, and was warmer, more attentive and professional than any server I've had elsewhere in Vegas, even in those pretentious \"five-star\" restaurants you'll find in abundance in this city.\n\nKeep in mind they're open from 6 am - 3 pm. I was told by a girl at the host desk that the best time to go was 6-8 and after 1:30.\n\nOverall value?\n\nPrice: 3.5\nService: 5\nAmbiance: 4\n\n= 4.17. But Yelp! doesn't offer a decimal rating. So a solid four stars from me. Worth visiting at least once if you want a tasty meal in a casual atmosphere without the pretentious attitude."

The one place that is MUST for us to go to for an amazing breakfast is the Egg & I restaurant. \n\nThis last visit was no exception to any of the past visits. The food was so fantastic. The options were endless. Who knew you could prepare eggs so many delicious and wonderful ways?\n\nLindsay our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We brought our youngest son on this trip (for his 21st birthday) and he was having a hard time making a selection. Lindsay took the time to answer all of his questions and gave him a great recommendation of the country fried skillet. He LOVED IT!!! Thank you LIndsay!\n\nAll I can say is - if there is a line or a wait (and there most likely will be) then take the time because it is worth it. The coffee is fresh and hot and the banana nut muffins are a MUST (unless you are allergic of course).\n\nWe only waited about 15 minutes and our food was on the table - pipping hot. I ordered my favorite - the Greek scramble. FOUR eggs, chicken, spinach, mushrooms,and feta cheese make up this belly busting breakfast. It is served with choice of toast or muffin (I got the muffin) and breakfast potatoes. \n\nMy hubby ordered the Chili omllete and he had a choice of chili's. His came with the same sides only he ordered toast instead of a muffin. I have no idea why because that muffin is served warm with butter. YUM!!!\n\nCost is a little higher than say a Perkins or iHop - but the food is SO much better! Expect to pay about $ 15 per person including a beverage. Serving size is SO BIG that you could almost split something and share."

They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.\n\nBreakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.\n\nBF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.\n\nYou pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way.

Even went on a double date for Valentines here! \nI can honestly say that the steggs(steak and egg) is better here compared to babystax. They don't have red velvet pancakes though, don't come here for that and be disappointed. Egg works bennys are farrrrr more tastier and better than babystax. It has much better flavoring. The potatoes on the side is seasoned really well. Can even preach that their potatoes fries taste better than babystax potatoes fries. The price here is cheaper than babystax. The only downside is the pancakes. Their pancakes and banana nut muffin was not good at all."

It was packed with a line out the door on the Saturday morning we went.\n\nI was able to try the combo meat skillet, beef hash skillet, and the stuffed french toast. Everything tasted homemade which places it above chain breakfast restaurants, but I think all cities have some sort of a joint that serves similar tasting dishes.\n\nOne thing that stood out was their banana nut muffin. Choose it over the toast, when asked what you prefer. This was the only thing that was better than anywhere else I have tried. I'm not a big fan of BNut, but if it tasted like the ones here, I would choose it every time.\n\nDecent breakfast joint, decent prices. I might hit it again to try out different dishes to see if anything that can knock my socks off."

Sorry no dancing ghetto looking dancing Despicable Me minions or card slappin' faux-porn peddlin' hombres here. What you will get though are those amazing banana nut muffins. The spinach benny I had was my saving grace, I doused it in hot sauce and devoured it Melissa McCarthy style. The waitress gives you your own container of coffee to refill your own mug instead of having to wait for her to come back. Jesus H. who does that anymore!!?? It's such a simple but awesome concept!

I don't think this place is as good as the reviews lead it to be... the place was packed when I went though, around 11am. It took about 30 minutes or so for a table. Looking at the menu, LOTS of stuff looked good and I had trouble deciding what to eat. The menu is a newpaper, which is actually really cute and different; also, there is a lot of word-play on the menu which I thought was cleaver. I ended up getting the chicken fried steak skillet and my brother got the carnitas skillet. Both did taste good, but I did not think it was spectacular. Portions were a good size, a bit larger than average. My chicken steak was tender and crispy and the gravy was good... but the house potatoes it came with was way too salty. I mixed everything together to try to lessen the salt taste, but in the end, I couldn't finish all the potatoes because, well, it was just too much salt. I think they need to put less of the seasoned salt on it. I'm a total potato lover and I couldn't finish my potatoes. My skillet also came with 2 eggs, anyway you want and a muffin or toast. I chose the muffin. It was good-average. I tried a bit of the carnitas skillet... but I'm not a big Mexican food fan... so it wasn't to my liking really, but my brother liked it. His did not come with a muffin or toast though. I also ordered coffee, thinking it was going to come in the interesting cup I see posted... it came in the ugly typical diner coffee cup...\n\nPersonally, I think Hash House A Go-Go has much better food and better prices... and way bigger portions!! My brother agrees with me too. \n\nI don't think this place is worth the wait... it didn't stand out in my mind. Just an average breakfast place. Prices are fair... my chicken fried skillet was $10.50 and the carnitas skillet was about $11. \n\nGo to Hash House A Go-Go if you want special yummy breakfast food... this place is just average."

This place has just about anything you could think of for hot breakfast, (except oatmeal) and some items you would never dream of.\n\nThe newspaper-style menu is a breakfast gazette of headlines - like carrot cake French toast, pork carnitas burritos, and just about every type of omelet and pancake you could ever imagine.\n\nLiza was our fabulous hostess on our dining journey. This woman is the epitome of a multi-tasker, buzzing around and paying attention to every little detail, from the quality of our food to the assurance our glasses remained full... and even the fact that I was rubbing my arms and she instantly picked up that I was cold and turned the air conditioner up a few degrees, without me asking. \nThis woman is amazing at customer service! \n\nAll of our food came out together (for seven people) and it was all piping hot! We were never left unattended and were quite entertained at how Liza perfectly orchestrated her tables (including our own).\n\nSome of the dishes at our table included:\n* Stuffed French toast - like a deconstructed monte cristo with bacon; delicious!\n* Vegetarian crepe - filled with veggie goodness.; so fresh and so clean-clean.\n* The Classic - hot scrambled eggs, toast and ham - American style.\n* Pork carnitas burrito - mexitastic pork in a verde sauce wrapped in a soft flour tortilla; to die for.\n* Egg whites and short stack of buckwheat pancakes - both cooked with no oil...  I was trying to watch my caloric intake, and The Egg and I was happy to accommodate me.\n\nIt's a bit of a drive from the strip, but so worth it! Bring your clan and ask for Liza!"

We had a veggie omelette and a veggie scramble. The potatoes were seasoned just right. Reading prior Yelp reviews beforehand, I doubted that the banana nut muffins could live up to the hype. Boy was I wrong. Excellent. Fluffy and not too heavy on the banana. Prepare for a large crowd and a wait on the weekend. The hostesses were very pleasant and friendly. The bus staff too.

A massive selection of eggs and other breakfast favorites means there is someone for everyone. \n\nWe both ordered egg dishes and they were huge portions at reasonable prices. A little more than $20 for the two of us; and you can eat here cheaper than we did if you want. \n\nIt's a no-nonsense diner-type atmosphere inside focused on fast service. The staff was fabulous. Our server, Karla, was like a best friend from the moment we sat down. They have these \"smile and frown@ signs on the table. If you are good, you put up the smile. If you need anything, you put up the frown. They watch for it and respond quickly. \n\nThere's a great outside patio and its dog-friendly. It's also a very kid friendly place. Plenty of space even at prime breakfast time and there was no wait. They turn tables quickly. \n\nOne thing of note:  they give you a pot of coffee. But on other drinks, refills are not free. Fine by us since the drinks they serve are very large. \n\nWhat a great find!  Thanks to Karla and the staff here for giving us a place to come back to when we are in town again."

So on our way out of town to the Grand Canyon, we did a quick Yelp search and found this gem. Being in Vegas, we thought it was funny that there were 777 reviews for this place, averaging 4.5 stars. It lived up to the hype! \n\nDefinitely ask for the banana nut muffins, they are amazing. As are the potatoes. As are the omelettes...heck, it was ALL great! I ordered the chile relleno omelette (yes you read that right) and it was dee-lish. \n\nOur server, Alyssa, was friendly and made sure everything was to our liking and topped off. The manager, Gia, stopped by our table to check in on us and ended up giving us some great ideas of places to check out on our road trip.\n\nAfter the crazy hustle and bustle and falseness of the Strip, it was great to eat at a down-home style diner. I liked it so much I wanted to buy a T-shirt, but they were out of the tie-dye one that I wanted. Which is probably the only non-five-star thing I can say about this place. We will definitely be back here again the next time we're in town!"

And their famed banana nut muffin was maybe too hyped up, so my expectations were not in line with what I actually tasted.  Not to say that it wasn't good. You do get a lot of food for the money though, considering you're in Vegas, so it's a steal. And the service was very friendly, like being in a diner where everyone knows your name. So if you're looking for a fix of good old fashioned, artery-clogging American breakfast, this would be a good option in Vegas if you don't want to break the bank in a casino establishment."

Thank goodness the wait wasn't too long because by now we've been on the road for 5+ hours and we're starving!!! \n\nI have a feeling that this place is super busy all the time--the restaurant is packed with people and the service is also super duper speedy, like the servers here are always on their toes to get people in and out as quickly as possible. But they're still super friendly, so I'm not complaining because I love the efficiency of this place. \n\nF O O D:\nHonestly the food here was a pretty big disappointment. For some reason the food here was very very salty--the ham, the sauce, everything. Eating this makes me feel super gross and pretty terrible about myself. Especially because the portion sizes here are HUGE! My friend and I shared the Stuffed French Toast and we couldn't finish it (sorry potatoes :( ). So I recommend sharing just one thing between you and a friend or you can always take it to-go. I thought the Stuffed French Toast was really delicious because it wasn't salty at all, but our friends that got the Eggs Benedict dishes weren't so lucky :( \n\nP A R K I N G:\nThere is a parking lot right out front so no worries about parking! \n\nDon't forget to check in for the free banana nut muffin!

My sister ordered a burger with a muffin as an appetizer,  the muffin never came.

There are half portions to the large portions, and my wife had the half omelet.  Veggie skillet was great as well. If you need wait staff help, you flip a little egg stand on your table."

Turns out, we've eaten here before as well.  It's really good, portions are plenty from a guy who likes big portions.  I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and my wife had the stuffed French toast with sausage.  Telling the truth, I was really looking for something that came with pancakes because I like a big breakfast, this place really didn't have many options.  It didn't need it.  You get a mountain of little diced up potatoes that are nuggets of seasoned fried heaven, large main potions that pancakes would put you in food coma.  Coffee is really the only thing that I would say could be better.  Good, but not spectacular."

So glad I did!\n\nThey were pretty crowded when we arrived but they somehow had a table available and sat us down right away.  My 1.5 year old was super cranky and everyone who worked there smiled and tried to get him to lighten up- no eye rolling or snippy comments.  \n\nThe kids got super cute menus that looked like little books/newspapers and crayons.  It kept my daughter well entertained.  Our server was friendly and super quick.  I got the eggs benedict and I'm not sure why.  I had never had it before.  There must've been a picture of it in the menu or something.  But let me tell you, it was SO good!  I've since ordered it back home in Chicago a couple different times and NOTHING compares to the one I had from Egg & I.  \n\nEach table has a little egg figure on it.  One side is a happy egg and the other side is a sad egg.  If you need ANYTHING you just turn your egg to sad and someone IMMEDIATELY tends to you- even in the chaos of a super busy day.  We needed more napkins and had more than we knew what to do with within seconds.  \n\nThe food was great.  The price was average.  The service was amazing.  The place seemed very clean and had fun whimsical decor.  They handled being very busy and I was not uncomfortable as a customer at all.

According to the receipt, the server's name is Card, not sure if that's right...She was pregnant and had some tattoos. Very helpful and attentive, especially considering she was carrying a baby around too!\n\nBack to the food, best traditional brunch place I have been in the States. We tried the banana muffin, spinach/avocado/veg omelet, gravy biscuits, pork, and sausage. Excuse me that I don't remember the exact name for the plates. Everything was good, so feel free to order anything that interests you on the menu. But make sure to pay attention to how much you order; the portion is very generous here."

I got the half order of eggs bennie and stuffed french toast.  My goodness!!!! What a meal!! I also had the coffee and all I added was two creamers, no sugar needed (I was getting enough from the french toast). The waitress was sweet enough to suggest half orders on the dishes.  My husband had the enchiladas and he loved them as well.  I didn't care for them as much- maybe since I wanted the sweet stuff.  This place is a must for anyone in the Vegas area.  It's obvious that they don't need my review- they are packed, but it's nice to be able to visit a great place like this. You will be amazed by the food and the service was great!! Thank you Egg and I!!!"

We arrived around 11am, and the restaurant was PACKED. However, upon checking in, the lead hostess informed that the wait was surprisingly only 15 minutes... Talk about efficiency!! They got it down here! Amazing customer service!\n\nOf course, Vegas is extremely hot and we were in a rush to eat and leave, so we were flexible with our seating. Outside was fine, and that's where we ended up. The outside patio was hot due to the weather, but they had some machines that automatically blew out cold must which helped a little. OSCAR- (woot woot!) our server, was absolutely AMAZING and provided exceptional customer service, making out group feel very welcome. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us some great suggestions for breakfast and lunch. Our entire party was beyond satisfied with the service, friendliness, and quick arrival of our food. Oscar provided us with the best banana nut muffins, which were served warm with butter. I had the breakfast burger with a fried egg on top, a side of delicious seasoned fries. They also serve stuffed French toast, and you have the option of getting half country potatoes and fruit, instead of full order of one or the other. Food was delicious and we will definitely drop by the next time we visit the Strip. Hands down, this is one of the best breakfast places I have been to!"

Make sure to come early to beat the long lines because this place can get packed. Their menu has a wide variety of choices that you can choose from. But whatever you order, make sure that you get the banana nut muffin.\n\n1. Sundance Omelette: It's the ultimate healthy veggie omelette. With feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and other deliciousness. I really liked the omelette. It comes with potatoes and your choice of toast or muffin. Get the muffin! All plates are pretty hearty, so this choice makes me feel less guilty of eating a lot of food haha (5/5)\n\n2. Cordon Bleu Skillet: Comes with seasoned chicken breast, diced ham, swiss cheese and delicious potatoes. This one tastes great with easy over eggs. Very flavorful and savory. Overall, a great one to choose from (5/5)\n\nThe service here is friendly. Prices are reasonable as the portion sizes here are HUGE. Credit cards accepted. Plenty of parking."

I was recently introduced to the benny and can't believe what I've been missing out on. There are so many sensational flavors in this dish that you just have to try it for yourself!  And those potatoes - I'm not much of a potato breakfast person but could not help stealing these off my friend's plate!\n\n- Strawberry stuffed french toast: I am more of a 'sweets' type of breakfast girl so I typically order french toast. You get 2 slices of toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese goodness.  Unfortunately, this dish starts to become a little TOO sweet at the end so it's a struggle to finish the last few bites.  (I've had to confirm this by ordering this dish twice.)  If you can share this dish with someone, that'd work out well.\n\n- banana bread muffins: you pretty much have to try this when you go there. I'm so confused because sometimes, I've been given the muffin for free and other times I've had to order it...but whatevs, you gotta do what you gotta do!  The muffin is soft and when served warm = bomb-dot-com.\n\n** ALSO, must note on the service. All the workers are very polite and friendly. If you ever need something, they have this egg face you can turn over at your table. When the egg is black, you're fine.  Need something? Then turn the egg over so it's yellow. I have to say, this system totally works. Because the few times we've need a coffee refill or something..flip over the egg face and *BAM* someone helps you out right away!\n\nThis is one of my breakfast spots of choice (another is Baby Stacks) for good, consistent, yummy breakfast food.  Prices are decent too!"

When we arrived, the restaurant was full and there were about 20 people waiting outside.  To me, that was a good sign.  We put in our name and waited only about 15 minutes to get seated.  \n\nWe were immediately greeted by our server Kat and while we were looking at the huge breakfast menu, she was busy slinging our coffee and juices.  It is really hard to make a selection off of their menu.  Everything sounded really good.  Even Kat (the server) couldn't narrow it down to the \"best item.\"  She said the best she could do was a \"top 10.\"  \n\nWe all ordered something different.  I had the Blackened Prime Rib Eggs Benedict.  It was really amazing.  The Hollandaise sauce tasted exactly how it was supposed to taste.  The Prime Rib could have been a little more blackened for my taste buds, but it was still very good.  Other members of my group had the Hawaiian breakfast with Portuguese Sausage, eggs and sticky rice.  Also ordered was the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet, the Blueberry Waffles, Blueberry Pancakes and your basic egg, meat and potato dish.  Everything was good.  Everyone at the table was raving at how good the food was and how they were all happy with their choices.  The banana nut muffins were an extra special treat.  \n\nOne more thing.  The service was amazing.  Kat was great...and the manager even came out and checked on us.  Great service!  And, to top it all...all seven of us and were out the door in under an hour even though it was a packed house.  \n\nSo if you are visiting Vegas and looking for a place to go, forget those expensive buffets and places on the strip and head over to this place.  I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed!"

So glad I finally stopped in!\n\nAll the reviews talk about their bannana nut muffin, but more on that later, first - the eggs...   I ordered the biscuits and gravy which comes with a side of 2 eggs (I chose scrambled) and a side of potatoes (the server allowed me to sub half of the potatoes for fresh fruit.\n\nEverything on my large plate was done perfectly.  The eggs were warm, tasty, and not under or over done.  The biscuits were deliciously moist and puffy (best I've had in as long as i can remember) with a very nice sausage gravy.  The potatoes were original and had a nice texture but the seasoning was a bit much for my taste.  And the fresh fruit was very sweet and well, fresh!  I really don't have a single complaint about the food.  I'd go here regularly for breakfast if it were closer to my house.\n\nFor first time goers you get a banana nut muffin on the house.  I don't care if you aren't a big fan of banana nut muffins, I'm really not.  But just eat it!  You won't regret it.  I don't know what they put in this pastry (sprinkled crack maybe?) but it was amazing.\n\nAs far as  the employees go, they all seemed happy, smiling, and they were genuinely nice.  There was no wait for me although I heard i just missed a rush.  everyone from the hostess to the servers to the cook did everything just right in my opinion.\n\nPrices are fair for breakfast.  My large plate with an iced tea came to eleven bucks and change.  More than what I'm used to paying for breakfast, but worthy for the quality of the feast, and I'd happily hand it over again."

Not one word was said to me, so we put an unhappy face on Mr Egg, but I still had to flag down our waitress, which took at least 5 minutes.  She seemed pretty annoyed when I asked where my food was. She said \"we can only put 4 orders on one ticket, so yours will take longer\". Hmm so why did 6 orders came out???  Finally, someone else came out because of the unhappy face on Mr Egg, and asked what she could do. I said everyone is almost done with their breakfast and I don't have mine. She went to check, making sure that we put the happy face back on Mr. Egg.. A few minutes later, our waitress came back and said that they were still baking the biscuits, and promised that she was watching for my order. Hmm, by then 3 people at my table had finished their breakfast. After another 5 minutes everyone was done eating , Finally a different person brought my order, with the explanation \"they poached the eggs, so they had to remake it with my cooked eggs\".  Ok which one of you clucks the truth?  So I got to eat while 6 people at my table watched me, so needless to say I ate pretty fast and didn't get to enjoy the egg-cellent food.  I'm pretty easy going when it comes to food orders, as normally we all do our best, But by the time I got my food and had to listen to 3 different reasons, I really did expect for them to take my meal (and only my meal) off of the bill. Was that too much to ask? Well I left with egg on my face, no discount...not even an apology. All I got was a \"there now you have your breakfast, you are all set\".  Really??? No we won't be going back to that location."

I always love to see a place with turkey bacon or sausage on the menu so that was def a plus for me. Ordered the Sunrise Mountain which is funny because I love a butter croissant it came with home fries turkey bacon eggs n cheese and I should have shared with my boyfriend he ordered stuffed french toast & he didn't finish his food either. \n\nBoth dishes were great, service was great and fast which is always a plus."

This lifted our spirits, because we both love breakfast foods. We drove a few miles to go to Egg and I simply because I wanted to try it based on the great Yelp reviews.\nWe were not disappointed. Everything was great for my first time ever eating here.\nWe walked in at 1215 and were immediately seated on a Thursday lunch hour. There were plenty of tables inside and out, and since it was a sunny calm day we decided it'd be nice to get out and get a little sun after being stuck in the doc office.\nI went with the \"This Little Piggy\" omelet and it was just the way I like it. Lots of egg, lots of cheese, and plenty of meats. It comes with chopped up bacon, chopped up sausage, and chopped up chunks of ham, folded in half and smothered with about a half pound of cheese!!!! Also comes with the country potatoes which I was expecting to be orgasmic based on reviews, but let me down just a little bit. Don't get me wrong they were really good, but maybe my batch just wasn't quite cooked long enough and they were a little softer than I like em. Also I got the banana nut muffin with my meal, (this thing WAS OUT-friggen-STANDING) and she brought it out before the meal, which I thought to be a little strange. But i was really hungry so it was just fine with me.\nMy honey got a breakfast burrito and she said it was really good, looked to me like it had a ton of peppers, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she enjoyed it. Had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all, this thing was pretty big and also came with the country potatoes.\nThis was a great breakfast experience and can understand how this place can get pretty busy at times. We were very happy with the food and mostly happy with the service, she was just a little slow a couple times and we were only there for about 45 minutes. i.e. forgot to get a sprite, and never really came back to ask us if we needed anything after our food was brought out and if it was cooked ok. After she brought the check we decided to get a refill to go since the sprite was $2.50 and brought late and we waited for a few minutes to see her but never did. In the end it worked out, when we paid we asked the cashier if she could help us in getting the to-go refill and she politely went and took care of that for us with a smile. :)\nThanks Egg and I, we will be back for sure!"

Located in a plaza with other businesses and there is plenty of parking.  \n\nI ordered the new york steak and eggs.  Steak was tender and juicy.  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Served with country ranch potatoes.  The country potatoes are basically small fried potatoes squares with ranch seasoning.  My GF had the cajun shrimp eggs benedict special.  The fresh fruit plate contains blueberries, madarin oranges, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew slices.  Fruits were fresh and it was a great way to start off the morning.  Expect to wait a few minutes if you have a party larger than 2.  Luckily it was just me and my GF and we were seated right when we arrived.  The staff were fast, friendly, courteous, and they were as accommodating as much as possible.\n\nEgg & I, you guys are now one of my favorite breakfast / lunch places to visit when I am around the Las Vegas Area.  Thank you for the great meal.\n\nBon Apettit"

It was easy to find and the staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Very professional and efficient. The restaurant was very clean and well cared for.  The food choices were all very tempting and our server, Karla, was very helpful, even recommending an egg breakfast for my husband that included everything he wanted for a better price than what he was going to order.  I had the Southwestern Cobb salad and it was delicious....very fresh and the chicken was hot off the grill! The banana muffin that came with my salad was yummy.  Lots of variety on the menu....but since I am not an egg lover I was glad there were plenty of choices that didn't focus on eggs.  We would highly recommend this place and will definitely come again on our next visit to Vegas.  Karla is the kind of server you love to have...she's friendly, efficient, knows the menu, is really helpful and gives you the perfect amount of attention while dining. Great start to our day all around!"

My BF had read a few great reviews about the Egg and I recently and suggested we try it after sitting in out DR. office appt. for 2 hours; needless to say it made us hungry.  The day was warm and not too windy so we opted to sit outside on the patio.  Nothing impressive but it did just fine.  The newspaper style menu was fun and different.  Right away I saw about 6 items I would like to try.  As did my hungry man.  I finally decided on the breakfast burrito.  And he picked This little piggy omelet.  Our food came very quickly and looked great!! The burrito was huge and looked great.  There was 4 scrambled eggs, cheese, peppers, onions and huge side of   their breakfast potatoes.  There was also a side of salsa that was tasty and not too spicy.  My BF food looked yummy as well, I knew this when he ate it all with few words.  \nThe only thing that could have been better was a more attentive server.  We had to look around for a water and soda refill.  I hate that.  She was however very sweet and seemed a little new.  I will defiantly be going back to try some of the other dishes that made my mouth water.  Overall, the Egg and I is a sure fire great breakfast experience."

It was a photo of an egg that you could flip to indicate to servers that you needed something. No one waving your hand to try to get the servers attention, they got a system down!\n\nNext, the food, I ordered corned beef hash and eggs, while my friend customized her scramble with chorizo plus biscuits and gravy.. The bf got some avocado omelette. All were delicious and the portions were huge! It looked like I barley made a dent in my food, but I was stuffed. The biscuits and gravy were probably some of the best I've had... And their banana nut muffins are worth a try for muffin fiends. Straight out of the oven to your table.\n\nGood service, good food, and great company.. All for a reasonable price.

We had to drop by the airport and chose Eggs & I as our go-to food spot afterwards.\n\nThe menu consists of a variety of eggs benedict dishes, omelettes, hash, and other breakfast items.\n\nService is homey and the vibe is definitely casual here.  The menu comes out printed on newspaper stock so perhaps their items change frequently.\n\nWe started out with their signature banana nut muffin which accompanies many of their dishes.  Light, soft, fluffy, and not too sweet, the banana nut bread was a hit and a great starter.\n\nOur entrees included a mish-mash of their popular dishes:\n\nPrime Rib Benny (or Benedict) - the highlight dish entree was an Eggs Benedict version made up of prime rib.  It replaces the traditional muffin with a croissant and is definitely a large portion so was plenty to share.\n\nFlorentine Benedict - a version made with spinach and ham.  Pretty good.\n\nChicken Fried steak - I only had a few bites, but I liked it.  It's a calorie killer though.\n\nKay's Omelette - another signatuer omelette, it had plentiful cheese, ham, and egg.  Kinda plain and not sure why this is so popular.  You could make similar omelettes at home.\n\nBrad's Chili - wasn't sure which chili to order and was recommended this one.  It came out lukewarm, had a bland flavor and was generally forgetabble. \n\nEggs & I is a decent brunch spot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  They take credit cards, including American Express."

I didn't feel right for the entire day after having breakfast there. They did give us a free loaf of banana bread and that was nice of them but I wish I had been more vocal in regards to not being charged for my meal. It just wasn't right. I was told that in the future I could request less cheese and less salt so that is good. If Egg & I management is reading this, May I please have a refund for my meal? Please? I can provide the date and time and amount. I charged it on my Chase Visa. I will update everyone later"

The muffin was very soft and moist, almost melt in your mouth. Very delicious. The skillet was also exceptional. The country fried steak needed a very light push of a fork for it to break apart. It was very tender and juicy. \n\nThe service was very friendly and welcoming. Our server Oscar was also very attentative and refilled our drinks before we finished drinking. That always scores huge points with me. This will definetly be a Vegas staple whenever im in town."

The menu is huge, and a little confusing, as the staples are towards the back (eggs, pancakes and waffles) while they seem to push several styles of eggs Benedict and four-egg omelettes (not a fan, blech.)  Service was what I expect from a half-decent diner - fast and punctual.  My waffle was not served with real maple syrup, which was a major bummer.  The potatoes that are included with the standard egg breakfast were small squares but were cooked perfectly and tasted a lot like French fries from Fuddruckers (heavy on the Thyme, which gives them a reddish, golden-brown color.) There's a little stand at the table with two metal egg badges. The first, in black, is a happy egg face which states to the wait staff that all is well.  The second is an egg-face in bright yellow with a somewhat consternated egg-face which signifies to the wait staff that you're either unhappy with the meal, but mostly tells them you need something.  I was in a particularly crappy mood, so I kept flipping the egg-face to the bright yellow unhappy egg-face, and the waitress was getting perturbed with me.  The turkey sausage was pretty tasty, so I'd recommend people order it if they decide to eat here.  In general, take it or leave it."

Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. \n\nThe Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.\n\nThe Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls\n\nThe menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.    \n\nThe omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.\n\nTo summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat..."

Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.\n\nThe Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.\n\nThen there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.\n\nThe Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.\n\nI really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.\n\nThe service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast.

We're often bumped by servers and patrons as they're making their way to tables.\n\nI also don't love how they *only* have those season-salty potatoes and not fresh hashbrowns. They have them, but only those frozen hashbrown patties. Meh. I like homestyle potatoes, but these really seem like they're dumped out of an Ore-Ida bag.\n\nThe last time we went, I asked for my poached eggs well in my eggs benedict and they came back *very* runny both times. I can handle a little runny, but these were like, runny to the point of being almost chilly inside the yolk.  It's a texture thing and it skeeves me. I know I'm not the only one. \n\nThey were really great when I sent it back the first time, but the second time, I felt like a total pain in the ass and was embarrassed having to ask them to redo it, even though it wasn't my fault. They were gracious and took it off our bill and the 2nd time they made it, the eggs were cooked well enough. (Yes, we tipped on the full cost of the bill.) \n\nI also am not wild about how they completely drown their eggs benedict in hollandaise to the point you can't even see the bottom and the english muffin gets really soggy. \n\nMy boyfriend's blueberry pancakes weren't that awesome either.  Kind of spongey and flavorless.\n\nFor the hype this location gets, it wouldn't be my first choice. But I know it's popular and beloved, so if someone else wanted to go, I'd go, but otherwise, I'd recommend one of their other locations."

I'm guessing that batter frying slices of Banana Bread is only legal in Vegas. \n\nLots of other goodies on the menu. My wife got a savory crepe that was delicious with a side of their seasoned potatoes that you don't want to stop eating. \n\nEscape from the strip and go here for breakfast if you are in town. It was so good, I went twice during our stay. \n\nService was good. Everyone is attentive and mostly smiling (which is rare to find). They give you your own pot of coffee which is a huge plus in my book."

Even though we were in Las Vegas, this could have been a small-town diner anywhere in the US. \n\nWe had a great breakfast with banana-nut muffins, of course!  We were going to share a chile relleno omelet, and asked for an extra muffin, when the waitress told us that we could order half orders of just about anything on the menu - the cost was half of the menu price + 50 cents.  We did that instead, order half an omelette and half an order of grilled banana bread french toast. So I said - well, we won't need the other muffin, but the waitress said - no charge! - I'll bring you an extra anyway.\n\nThe food was excellent. The breakfast potatoes need some work - they were just hard fried \"bits\" of potatoes - but everything else was great.  A carafe of coffee was left on our table so that we didn't have to keep asking for refills, and cream/flavored creamers are on the table to make a perfect cup of coffee.\n\nIt was delightful - a trip back in time!  Don't miss it if you have a car in LV!"

It was creamy and yellow, yes.  But there was no butter taste, or lemon.  Moreover, the slice of ham on the benedict was so thick and strong flavored that it was the predominant flavor.  \n\nI ordered the HAM AND MUSHROOM SKILLET with TWO EGGS OVER EASY.  It's a baby skillet, with the bottom lined with the restaurant's ubiquitous Ranch Potatoes, mixed with diced ham, sliced mushrooms, topped with a handful of shredded cheese and topped with 2 eggs, any style.  It's all very salty, cheese, filling and pretty good actually. \n\nFYI: the Ranch Potatoes are diced taters completely drenched in Lawry's seasoned salt and they use it anywhere potatoes might be needed.  The result is ..seasoned salt EVERYWHERE!\n\nStick with basics like pancakes and eggs and these skillet-y things.  Don't get anything where skill might be needed to cook it."

My bf and I grabbed breakfast here a couple days ago and I just had two over easy eggs, wheat toast, and blueberry muffin. Muffin is always moist here and it's served warm so butter is a must. My bf got the steak n eggs with ranch potatoes and said he still loves it. Ranch potatoes are always flavorful here. I also suggest the tuna melt here--delicious. Service is good, we're so used to coming here so we don't mind the inconsistencies they have with their service. Although it would've been great if they wouldnt have alot of turnovers with their staff. It was great coming in here and the staff knew our names. But ever since the turnover we don't know anyone anymore except the host lady. Once again, food makes up for it so we shall be back regardless."

The skillet my wife had with the Portuguese sausage seemed over salted and gave her a stomach ache and sent her to the bathroom several times. Our waitress was forgetfull and not very knowledgeable about the menu.  We probably wont be back for a while as long as the Omelet house is still in business. Sorry Eggs & I"

The Egg and I has a cute name and an old cowboy ranch feel to it. The menus are newspapers and the servers are friendly!\n\nFood (4 Stars): I ordered the corned beef hash with over medium eggs and the banana nut muffin. I'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. It was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. The corned beef hash was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. The seasoned potatos were DELICIOUS and I wish I could've had more.\n\nWe ordered the Cinncinati 4 Way plate with onions. It is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. Our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. It was amazing!!! Who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? Topped with cheese and onions, this is my dish!\n\nWe couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. The food is still good after being reheated.\n\nService (4 Stars): Our cute server was friendly and humorous. She frequently checked up on us and refilled our cups, she even got us another table because ours was cramped.\n\nBottom line: Hungover? Hungry? Feeling like stuffinf your face? Egg ans I will satisfy it all."

We all got halfway through our meals and almost needed to go boxes already so hefty indeed especially with the seasoned potatoes they serve with most of the meals. We decided to give Egg & I a try and we are in awe! MY father-in-law had the Blackened prime rib benny and he automatically fell in love. My husband had the Cordon bleu skillet as he is a huge cordon bleu fan and he now knows exactly where to go to have such a delicious breakfast. I had the Cabo breakfast burrito, the sauce that covered it went extremely well with the burrito. I am a HUGE fan of Banana muffins so of course I got one before our meals came, we all shared it and it came warm and SO soft. When we arrived it was full house WITH a couple families waiting in front of us. Not even 10 minutes and we were seated. Not even an hour and we were on our way out the door fed, bill paid and happy while it was STILL packed, fast service. Only one thing, you guys should get bigger Orange juice cups, it's about half the size of the water cups and it's good juice so it was gone in 2 mins."

For food I recommend the works skillet or any of their omelettes. They also have Hawaiian style food, which I haven't had the chance to try. The wait can go fast although it might take longer for larger groups. Parking can be a hassle during weekends.

Loved that a carafe of coffee was left on my table, so I could serve myself when I wanted more.  Loved that the cost was less than a hotel buffet -- and I didn't have to serve myself!  It is now our FAVE."

I had classic breakfast with hash browns that look like McDonald's  hashbrowns they are so good . Wait time runs about 30 min but it's worth it as it goes by pretty fast. I love how they serve the mimosas with its own champagne bottle and juice . Overall our server and food was great. Thank you Liliana for making our experience pleasurable."

I got the Flapper and my friend got one of the omelet with spinach, chicken, feta cheese, tomato, and bacon. Both were alright, except I think the omelet was a bit salty probably from the feta cheese. It's a good breakfast place I think. Their banana nut miffin is pretty good. I think it's the best banana nut muffin I ever had because it's sweet - maybe honey and brown sugar and soft and moist and warm when we got it, but also a bit oily. Taste like cake."

Best part is that it's off strip--meaning that the price is reasonable and not completely inflated and ridonkulous.  It's not too far off strip where it's a drag to get to, but you'll definitely have to drive or take a cab.\n\nWe've only visited during the week, so we haven't really ever had to wait for a table, but I can imagine that weekends can get pretty hectic.\n\nFood for DAYS!  Portion sizes are pretty large + with most breakfast entrees, you'll receive a choice of toast or their incredible banana nut muffin.  If you choose against getting the muffin, you're BSC!  Their muffin is the shyyyyza, plus they currently have a Yelp check in offer for a free muffin!  DOUBLE MUFFIN!  I haven't strayed away from my favorite (chicken fried steak with their perfect potatoes), but their menu is quite extensive, and I'm pretty confident you'll be able to find something that you'll love on there.  But seriously, what's in those potatoes?  You've got me addicted, Egg & I!\n\nThe servers are attentive and friendly, but the tables also have a small egg sign to get their attention.  It's a yellow, sad egg when you need assistance (so cute).  Every time we've gone, we've never had to utilize this, since their waitstaff are so great.\n\nEgg & I will always be on our list for breakfast eats when we're vacationing in Vegas!"

We also got half an order of carrot cake French toast- which we thought was too sweet. The banana nut muffin was terrific- very moist, fresh out of the oven, and not too sweet.

She began to goad me on to get avocado, which was strange after saying no several times. I repeated that it was fine; at that point i didn't care for it. Eventually I submitted but asked for only a little amount of avocado. She brings me avocado and soon after - the check. I look at the check, no avocado charge. I was happy, and ready to pay. A few minutes later, she sneakily replaces the check with a brand new one. I hardly noticed that she had done that and after looking at the check again, a $3 avocado charge made me cringe. Wtf? If it was your mistake and I said I was fine on avocado, why would you goad me on to get it? Then give me a check without it (again forgetting, but this time you forgot to charge me so might as well leave it), and replace it with a ridiculous charge? And do not call your customers \"babe\", it's just weird especially when you say it behind them. \"Thanks babe\" - as I was holding the check in my hand. Thanks? No thanks lol.I wish I remembered her name, but she was some older red-haired lady. I was not pleased with this incident.\nAlso, their \"Habla Diablo\" potatoes, which comes with every meal, are horrendous. They taste like over seasoned, beyond-salty fast food potatoes. 2 stars for getting seated quick, polite service, and a banana \"nut\" muffin for a side, despite the fact that it was overly sweet and did not receive the slightest bit of nutty flavor. Be weary of such scenario as I have endured. For these reasons, I would not consider returning."

I've been dying to try it ever since driving by once and seeing the line out the door.\n\nWe dined on a Friday morning around 11 and there was a wait of about 15 minutes.  The menu is cute and read likes a newspaper. \n\nThe portions are huge and we split 3 dishes between the 4 of us. \n\nCatherine's Scramble: chicken, mushrooms, spinach, feta and artichokes.  I was sold on all the ingredients and the dish was amazing and flavorful.\n\nBacon, avocado and cheese omelette: full of bacon flavor and packed with avocados.  Usually when I get avocado with my omelette it is served sparingly with just a few pieces on top.  They were not stingy with it and filled it completely.\n\nCorned beef hash: the good stuff, not canned corn beef.  Eggs and toast were included.\n\nAll the dishes were served with a side of ranch potatoes, which is amazing in itself.  I would eat the potatoes alone!\n\n Priced well with large portions.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes.    \n."

Yelp recommended this place so the wife and I gave it a try. \nPretty busy for a Monday morning. Were seated within 2 minutes, great. Server was friendly and attentive. Wife had the strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast...yummy. Very good with a nice sized portion. \nI had the corned beef hash. Good stuff, also a nice sized portion. I love corned beef hash and this was homemade. Excellent. Hit the spot. Great food, good service, reasonable prices.\nI was not too fond of the location ( I felt it was a bit far) but I wanted to avoid the strip so I guess I shouldn't complain. \nThe only CON for me was the lack of info on the server's part. I love pancakes, and always have them for breakfast when I dine out. I asked for pancakes instead of toast and was told they could not do that. Okay, no biggie. Not the first place that does this. However, the pancakes were HUGE and 3 came with the order. I barely even touched them because I was almost full from the hash. I was pretty upset that I dropped $6.25 for an order of pancakes that I had less than 1/4 of because of the shear size. I feel the server could've let me know they were huge and given me an option. Service is a big part of the experience when dining out. If I wouldn't have dropped $6.25 on uneaten pancakes our server would've gotten a nicer tip."

Ultimate Skillet was definitely a classic and very satisfying - A flavorful combination of sausage, ham, bacon, mushroom, onions, tomatoes, spinach and bell pepper, topped with a perfectly poached egg. Ohhh.... and that's not the end of it! All order came with a banana nut muffin that was moist and soft.......\n\nYummmmmmmmmm...... definitely worth the wait!"

Not even busy. But right when we opened the door, crowds poured out, and we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table for two. The wall decor by the waiting place was cute. There were cartoons as well as sayings about eggs. Finally, we were led to our table by a super friendly and bubbly waitress.\n\nThe menu is printed like a newspaper - cool!! I've never seen that before!! (Yes I took a picture with it.) The selection is pretty extensive considering that every single item on the menu are made with eggs (like skillet items, omelettes, etc), so it took us a while to decide. I forget what we ended up getting - it was a while ago, pardon me - but I remember it being soooo good! They also customize your order so that you can have whole eggs vs egg substitutes vs egg whites, etc... Definitely get the fresh banana nut bread!! We almost got a loaf to take home back to LA even though we weren't leaving for LA yet.\n\nThe service was superb. Our waitress kept coming by to check up on us. When the busboy accidentally tossed our leftovers, the waitress felt so bad that she went back to the kitchen and got us some other foods to take with us. This was one place where I seriously went in not expecting much and left completely satisfied with the full intention of coming back next time I am in Vegas."

I have tried both the Chili skillet and the Ultimate skillet, both were excellent.  I also recommend the banana nut muffin side.\n\nI would, however, advise against ordering from their Mexican inspired menu.  They should definitely leave the chorizo con huevos to the Mexican joints.\n\nOverall one of my favorite Vegas dining spots, for breakfast or a late night snack (they are open til 3AM)."

I ordered the Prime Rib Benny and was more than satisfied at how generous the portion was along with how delicious it tasted!  Now I know a Prime Rib Benny isn't something that sounds all too familiar to anyone who hasn't been to this restaurant, so picture this:  juicy and flavorful pieces of blackened prime rib chopped up with poached eggs crowning an open faced buttery croissant, which is then drizzled with a rich and creamy hollandaise sauce.  It's like what traditional egg benedicts dream to be some day basically.  Regular eggs benedict is Carlton Banks, Prime Rib Benny is Will Smith.  You get the picture.\n\nBesides the entr\u00e9e itself, my order of OJ was fresh squeezed and just right.  Their lemonade was great too, which is a definite plus in my book.  I also had a taste of their French fries and Portuguese sausage, which my cousins ordered and both were very tasty, too!  The fries were thin, crispy and flavorful.  While the Portuguese sausage was not overly oily and fatty and was cooked just right.\n\nService was verygood, as our waiter was attentive, friendly and always available.  They have this nifty little feature on your table where there's a sign of a sad face and on the other side of it, a sign of a happy face.  When you want your server's attention, you just flip the sign to show the sad face and you'll be helped right away.  I found this to be a very memorable and smart way of the restaurant going the extra mile to offer as much quality service to its patrons."

The menu is very extensive, which is surprising, because they do most of the items on the menu VERY well.\n\nBetween the 4 of us that tried Egg & I, we each got different dishes and were all very happy with the food. The portion size is huge as well. If you're not that hungry, share with someone. The omelettes are made with not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 eggs. FOUR EGGS. It's a beast omelette among eggs.\n\nThree things I will highlight: The eggs benedict, the banana nut muffin, and potatoes.\n--Eggs Benedict: Order this and you will not be disappointed. The hollandaise sauce that's drizzled over the eggs is something that most places mess up, but at Egg & I, it's made to perfection -- smooth, creamy and seasoned just right.\n--Banana Nut Muffin: They give this to you when you order and omelette, and don't miss out. It's the most airy, soft, moist -- yes, moist -- muffin you'll ever eat. It's like they fold air into the batter before baking. THAT GOOD.\n--Potatoes: MY GOD. These are the best side of potatoes I've ever had. I'm convinced they have to be fried, but I'm not sure. The exterior is exquisitely golden crispy with a perfect seasoning blend on the outside. Best potatoes west of the Mississippi; hands down.\n\nPros: Breakfast food for gods\nCons: Can get busy, limited parking"

Our omelettes were moist, perfectly cooked, and stuffed with fresh ingredients. The potatoes at Egg and I were nothing short of addictive. It took what little will power I had on our last morning in Vegas to push away from my plate.\n\nWe will come here for breakfast every time we are in Vegas now."

I had The Classic with bacon- two eggs over medium, bacon, potatoes, and a banana muffin. Everything was great, but the potatoes stole the show! So super crispy and seasoned marvelously! Seriously, so good. Now I have to figure out how they made the potatoes so crispy! Definitely will visit on any future Vegas trips. The service was also top-notch.

I guess b/c I had such a great experience with EGG WORKS their sister place I had put this place on such a high pedestal and they fell off... and no all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put this bk together again. \n\nENTREE: my bf got the franciscan scramble. sounded really good and he's a professional order-er. Its amazing to watch him work. Everything he orders always comes out spectacular and the best tasting dish at the table. not me.  I had a the tostada last time and I had really wanted the cobb salad but was torn. So this time cobb salad was my only request. \ndisguisting. \n\nCOBB: I love cobb salads. This was just plain GROSS. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of ICEBURG LETTUCE. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. They gave me 1/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word EGG in it.. i was very disappointed. You'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no.\non top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since I've lived here. \n\nMaybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. I take some responsibility in that I guess. my bf's omelet was delicious. the potatoes were good.. so was his banana nut muffin.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & I... and yes good food vs. bad food. \n\nThe only reason I gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :) \nHere's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & I."

Good to know that when we took two friends to eat there on their recent visit, nothing has changed. Same huge menu; same great service; and same fantastic seasoned potatoes!\n\nI had the bacon and avocado omelet, and my husband had the Cincy chili omelet, both with sides of potatoes (of course!). One of our friends ordered the Country Benny, and the other had an order of potatoes with a side of brown gravy. We all left pleased and sated, and my husband and I had leftovers as well!\n\nEverything on the menu looks fantastic, but I suggest getting an egg dish (seeing how the name of the place is \"The Egg & I\"!) The \"Three Pigs\" and the mashed potato omelets are good bets, along with all the other items mentioned above. And definitely get the seasoned potatoes. Although my husband thinks they're overseasoned, I humbly disagree. To me, they're the best in town!"

We were seated right away, service was attentive and friendly, and prices were decent. The menu is vast, with all the traditional breakfast options as well as some unique ones like the \"crepelette\" an omelet/crepe hybrid. They offer dozens of lunch items too.\n\nI had the \"Flapper\" breakfast platter ($8.95) which consists of 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 sausage (your choice of pork or turkey). The eggs were perfectly cooked (I like 'em over easy). Any place that offers a turkey sausage option is awesome for me as a non pork-eater. The real star of the plate was the pancakes. They were perfection! I am usually more of a french toast/waffle person so this was a gamble for me. The pancakes were piping hot, spongy yet fluffy in texture, and really flavorful! Served with a side of hot maple syrup too.\n\nI would highly recommend Egg & I to anyone looking to get away from the Strip for an inexpensive and tasty breakfast."

The banana nut muffin comes before the meal and it is SUPERB!!  Everything we ordered was FANTASTIC!!  The eggs (over-easy), the bacon, the link sausages, the pancakes, and of course the waffle (loaded with strawberries and whipped cream) could not get any better.  We visit Las Vegas at least 3 times a year and this time we were celebrating our 7th year anniversary.  We've done the hotel dining thing at most of the 4 & 5 star rated places and they don't even come close to being as good as the Egg & I.  We do have to thank Denny's for being so awful the morning before and that is what led us to the BEST BREAKFAST in fabulous Las Vegas.  Being from Hawaii, it was a pleasant surprise to see a \"hawaiian\" section in the menu.  A lot of Hawaii people visit the 9th island and we will definitely be telling our friends about this wonderful eatery on West Sahara."

I flipped through and saw this place called Egg & I and their other location Egg Works. It looked interesting and the reviews sounded good plus had coupon for one meal free with purchase of another meal. Cool..I will take my co-workers there. Big mistake! They know best known for banana nut muffin served warm with butter but it had this weird taste as if they used artificial sweetener or perhaps the blend wasn't right because it tasted like metal or whatever it just tasted awful. It was nice to give all 6 of us free banana nut muffin but my guys wouldn't touch it!\n\n I ordered classic eggs Benedict, my fav breakfast choice. I was excited plus the potatoes versus hash browns. The potatoes had too much of that lawry seasoning...ugh. Then worse, my hollandaise sauce was the worst thing I have ever had! They didn't properly make the sauce and then to make it worse, the whole dish was slathered in it! I literally used a spoon to scoop out the sauce just so I could eat everything else which wasn't much better but I needed to eat. Would never come back even if I was paid to do so plus I read other reviews where this place was actually busy and needed to go early, well we were there Saturday morning around 8am and it was not busy at all!"

My parents got similar food; the only problem was that the food is a bit more pricey than our standards, but compared to some restaurants on the strip the price was not bad.

We went on a Saturday and we got seated right away, no wait.  But as we left, there was a line and that was around 1:00pm. I love corn beef hash and so I had to try their corn beef hash.  It came with eggs and toast (can choose muffin instead of toast) and if you check in on yelp you get a free banana muffin.  Our waitress forgot ours but we didn't make a big deal about it.  Corn beef hash was shredded style and I thought it was below par.  Not the best corn beef.  The place reminded me of another Dennys. Dennys being better. The restaurant also sells merchandise and sauces at the entrance."

A couple weeks ago we went there and I have been there a lot, I enjoy their food. My friend and I both ordered sandwiches; we asked to skip the bacon and bread for a healthier meal of course. We all know even though you skip stuff off the meal ordered, you end up paying full price which is fine. Well we asked if we both add avocado to both our meals in place of bread and bacon considering those items are priced higher. After going back and forth with our server who claimed it was against their policy to sub, a veggie/fruit item for a meat/bread item, she brought out the manager. The manager explained that they have two different accounts where they order meats/breads from and where they order veggies/fruit from and they could not, in fact they refused to sub it. We got over it, added the avocado and enjoyed our meal. It wasn't about having to spend the money for it, it was the principal. I bring a lot of friends and family to this place, therefore I expected them to sub it out for me because in the end, it was actually more cost effective for them. I thought it was silly and ridiculous, she actually looked slightly stupid for coming out and to explain the reasoning as to why we couldn't sub it. I actually laughed. So although the food might be at least 4 stars, their service and policies were not and I doubt it was worth it for them to do that to my friend and I earning this some-what bad review. There are a lot of great breakfast spots in Las Vegas so I will hunt down one to take people where they don't fret over silly substitutions on sandwiches. I am very open-minded and understanding; in fact I have ran a restaurant for yrs in the past and know when it is worth it to suck it up and do the substitution."

Two eggs, bacon, Habla Diablo potatoes, and choice of toast or a banana nut muffin.  The waitress recommended the Works omelet - stuffed with bacon, ham, sausage, veggies and topped with cheese. Very good!!!  We even got a free muffin for checking in there on Yelp! Check this place out. It's off the strip west on Sahara Ave."

Yes I had to wait 40 minutes but oooohhh it was worth it. I had this veggie Benedict meal which was a healthy indulgence. Fresh perfectly cooked poached eggs atop of FRESH spinach, yes fresh not cooked like other places do a spinach Benedict. Then the tomato slices were grilled and with fresh avocado. Once again I subbed the fruit for the potatoes. So impressed with the array of sliced fruit. My family loved the huevos rancheros as well as the huge chocolate chip pancakes. I must mention that our server Linnea was delightful and sweet. So attentive and friendly. If you are in Vegas, you must go here."

It was so hard to choose something from the menu...everything sounded so good! They have something for everyone. I had the the \"Egg-Ceptional Omelette\" with a side of country potatoes and my, was it exceptional! The omelet was loaded with sausage, diced ham, onions, tomatoes, sliced mushrooms, bacon, and cheese...and topped with sour cream. yummm! My husband had our usual...eggs benedict...and that was very delicious as well. The portions are huge! My husband eats like a beast...and I, like a man...and we still couldn't finish our food. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She came back periodically to tend to us with a huge smile on her face. Also, the food came out very fast! My tasty and fulfilling brunch definitely prepared me for a long and crazy day-night on the strip."

Once our orders were taken, the food arrived fairly quickly, no mistakes or wrong items.  We pretty much all ordered something different.  I had the house made (not canned) corn beef hash and eggs.  Excellent.  Can't remember what everybody had but all raved about their food.\nAvoid the strip with it's lines and cheesy buffets and overpriced breakfasts and check this place out.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who suggest that when dining here with company it would be wise to split dishes as the portion sizes are very generous! I ordered the Hobo scramble which was a special and not available on the regular menu. I am sucker for a scramble however the superior quality of the muffin has convinced me to sample the sweeter items (waffles) on the menu the next time I visit this place. Lots of people rave about the potatoes and I have to say that they were not what I personally am looking for in a potato. They are covered in seasoning and I just prefer a simpler potato flavor. The coffee was great and I cannot say that about many places! Here it is a good strength with a good flavor and it comes in cute mug with two happy eggs on it! Probably my favorite thing about this place is the little egg sign at your table that you can flip from happy to sad when you are in need of something. It beats having to pay close attention to flag down your waiter whenever they walk by. On our visit we didn't even have to use it because the service was so good!"

I am so glad we did. When we pulled in there was a line of people outside waiting. Despite the line we only waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. The menu was bigger than I thought. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. I didn't take a picture of it normally because I was 3 or 4 bites deep before I realized I didn't take a picture. The portions were large and the food came out fast. The wifey said she loved the banana muffin. I didn't get it. I can't give an honest opinion about the muffin because I don't enjoy muffins. Back to the portions, they were so huge this chubby boy couldn't finish it. The potatoes were seasoned just right and not overly covered in seasoning. I am picky about my gravy and it compares well with my aunts gravy. This place is a no fluff breakfast joint. Highly recommended!"

After looking up a few places, ie. Denny's, Hash House a Go Go, we decided to come here even though it's off the strip. We took a Lyft from Venetian and the ride was only $11. \n\nWith a party of 10, we thought that the wait would be around an hour, hour and a half, but amazingly, it was only thirty minutes. If you are coming here though, expect a long wait, so be patient, but it's worth the wait! Once we got seated, they handed us menus which looks like a daily newspaper. Deciding what to eat here was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make since there are 8 pages of food to read. Took a while but I finally decided on the Santa Cruz Skillet. \n\nSanta Cruz Skillet: The order came with toast and butter (since I got the muffin with the check-in) and sunny-side up eggs. The potatoes, chorizo, Santa Cruz sauce and the runny yolk was probably the best breakfast you could ask for after a night of drinking. Portion-wise, you could easily share this with another person but I was able to finish it on my own. \n\nService was amazing throughout the meal, they have a system where you flip the happy egg to a sad egg whenever you need something, genius! I would have subtracted a star for them bringing out the 2 Bloody Mary's and Michelada after we almost finished the food, but they didn't charge us for the drinks in the end. On top of that, 7 of us checked-in for the free Banana Nut Muffin. I can't stress this enough, don't forget to check in! Will be back here for sure to try the other items on the menu. \n\nBeware: You will get a food coma after eating here, we all ended up taking a nap in the room afterwards, but once again, soo worth it!"

Amanda was a very knowledgeable, amiable and capable waitress. She got our orders correct and our food came out promptly. \n\nSpeaking of food, I ordered the mashed potato omelette and my friend got the chicken fried steak skillet. Whoever though about putting garlic mash inside of a bacon omelette is a genius. Either that or they have grandmothers chained up in the back putting elbows and feet in the food. Absolutely amazing!!

But after going to three Rachel Ray recommended places (Vegas, LA, and Denver), I think I'm done trusting her judgment!\n\nWe went on a rainy, Saturday morning around 10:30 and had to wait maybe 15 minutes in a small waiting area which was crowded w/ folks trying to avoid the cold rain.\n\nWhen we were seated I already knew what we were going to order b/c I had Yelped the place and read their menu online.  I ordered the Ultimate Skillet for the b/f (he likes breakfast skillets), and the large Cashew Blueberry Pancake for myself.  \n\nWe had the \"famous\" banana nut muffin as our bread choice with the skillet, and let me just say, it was a regular ol' banana nut muffin.  I was gonna buy a whole loaf if it turned out to be good, but really, it was nothing to write home about.  Very average.\n\nThe b/f noted that the skillet was made up mostly of their potatoes (another thing that ppl rave about).  I hardly got any of the other ingredients in there so I was disappointed in the skillet, too.\n\nThe pancake was alright.  It *WAS* big, as others have commented, but again, no big deal.  It was served with blueberry compote and I thought that helped b/c it tasted sorta dry.  The b/f thought some of the pancake was undercooked b/c he could taste the batter.  Maybe I should've gone w/ the silver dollar sized pancakes?\n\nAlso, I think cashews don't really work w/ pancakes (unlike walnuts and macadamia nuts).\n\nThe \"large\" 12-oz glass of OJ was pretty small so the b/f thought it was funny they would call it a \"large.\"\n\nBreakfast with tip was around $25 I think.  Not cheap for what you get.\n\nI think I'll make Dunkin Donuts my new Vegas breakfast routine whenever I'm in town again."

I dug through the omelette for it and finally saw tiny small crumbles of it in there. The egg was thick and dry and the only good thing about it was the avocado chunks inside. Big pieces of avocado. That's IT.  The potatoes it came with were not good. Just deep fried potatoes. The side of fruit was much better. The corned beef hash was mushy and had a lot of potatoes.

This place was great- we were seated right away and ordered right away..  The breakfasts were huge, I got the chicken omelette it was really tasty, a bit too many of the mini potatoes, would have been better to have more omelette but still plenty of food.  One of my kids got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were great!.  Also they had something for everyone, our youngest only wanted chicken fingers and French fries at 8:30am and they had it available.. My wife had the rancho scramble and it was amazing!  This place lived up to its billing on the Internet, best breakfast we had in 3 days in Vegas!"

The Sundance Special, a veggie omelet with thought behind it, was actually pretty yummy (artichoke, feta, spinach...great flavors), but the potatoes that come with were pretty yucky. Just cubed potatoes that are overly seasoned and taste previously frozen, not that fresh.\n\nThe tuna melt was the WORST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. SOOOOO BAD! The \"cheese\" looked like a non-melting version of Velveeta. I'm not sure it was real. I had to scrape it off; it was disgusting. Also the tuna salad part was the worst tuna salad ever. It was a mushy, wet, flavorless glob of mayonnaise mess. The Parmesan bread it comes on is super-salty. The matchstick fries it comes with don't taste that fresh and are overly spiced.\n\nI picked the sandwich to pieces, and most pieces remained on my plate. I ate my partner's Sundance Special, because Vegas portion sizes allow for that. The server didn't even bother to ask how our food was, just slapped the check down and didn't comment that I had barely touched my plate.\n\nThe flavored coffee (hazelnut) is really gross. Bad idea to order it, but it tastes like the bad idea it is--overly sweet with its sweetness covering up that burnt taste that most diner coffee has.\n\nThis is the kind of place that automatically brings straws with water and gives you styrofoam for your leftovers."

Today's late breakfast was the best service hands down. Earl was our server and I did double check the name since I suck at remembering. Me and a friend came to catch up on things and I recently recruited her to Yelp and had her check in. With the check in we each got the banana nut muffin. Which was a 5 out of 5 Yelp star rating. For breakfast I always stick to the basics so I usually always order \"the classic\". Which comes with eggs, one choice of meat (bacon, sausage and I must note each come in turkey too), potatoes & toast. My friend got the \"Country Benny\" which she was very pleased with. Earl checked on our table throughout our whole visit. Also, if you've been to any of the chain restaurants then you know they have this egg shaped smiley face that you can flip to a sad face to grab anyone's attention for service. Needless to say, we didn't have to use it. Oh and Earl kindly offered me each type of creamer they had for my coffee! So for the first time there I didn't have to have plan old half & half. \n\nTo top it off they gave us a military discount for my friends portion of the bill! They actually check ID with your credit cards too here!!! #WINNING\n\nThanks for the hospitality Earl!"

So the food is a big part of dining out, but then there's service which we all know can make or break an experience ...\n\nAmanda was incredible! She was polite, friendly, and fast without being pushy! She encouraged us to take our time and when we were not quite sure what to order she offered recommendations which we definitely took and did not regret! The cinnamon roll and banana muffin were also DELICIOUS! \n\nAn elderly impatient man sat himself behind us and after only a minute of being sat was incredibly rude and calling out for a waitress and coffee (despite not waiting to be sat by the hostesses). Amanda was calm and very polite when she greeted him which I can tell you, takes a lot when you aren't being treated with respect! \n\nSo with food and service being on point, I'd have to say this place is a hit and worth traveling off the strip for while in the area! I'll definitely be back and recommend it to friends! Thanks again staff and especially Amanda!"

I arrived at around 5:45 am and fidgeted in my rental car while checking the \"closed sign.\" Suddenly another car pulled up next to me, the driver walked out and headed straight into the restaurant - the sign was magically on Open. Wtf... \n\nThe hostess/waitress was so friendly (and at the buttcrack of dawn thats pretty impressive) that I think this partly made me enjoy not only the food but much of the rest of my day.\n\nThe front lobby is decorated with articles and reviews AND pictures of eggs in action shots which I found pretty amusing (sometimes it doesnt take much) but the main eating area is pretty diner-y so I kind of zoned out till the food arrived. Ordered the fender bender egg crepe with avocado and sprouts and something else in it and it came out surrounded by a mountain of delicious seasoned potatoes and the softest, freshest muffin i've ever had. The egg crepe is in a league of its own compared with any kind of omelet you can get at IHOP or denny's or some drive by diner. \n\nI sat there for a good half hour savoring the meal. At the end it was all gone - the muffin, potatoes, egg crepe and the bucket of coffee. For the amount of food I had, it was very very light and felt quite healthy. I didn't get hit by the food coma train on the way home which is a big plus.\n\nAs a heavy consumer of all things chicken, I recommend this place to everyone. Unless you don't have taste buds...then go to your local diner where your $4.99 omelet brings you to orgasm every sunday morning. If you have taste buds - go eat here. Pay a little extra. Its worth it. I would guess that this is the best \"cheap\" breakfast i've ever had."

The food here is good! I've tried their Original Breakfast burrito, the Ensenada burrito, and homemade corn beef hash skillet. They all come with a side of country style seasoned potatoes. My hubs and I love them potatoes! Order yourself a lemonade (free refills) and chow down! I've only been here 3 times this year but every time that I've eaten here, I'd leave satisfied! \n\nTexas style French toast wasn't really a home run for us. We should have stuck with pancakes/waffles instead. There's always a wait especially on the weekends. They have a dog friendly patio."

Perfect execution of this dish.\n3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nService: The hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient.

Started with coffee which was surprisingly good - very mellow with a good flavor.  I even thought about asking what kind of coffee they use, but unfortunately forgot.\n\nI ordered my favorite - corned beef hash and eggs, while the lady ordered country fried steak.  CBH was in a soft patty form.  The corned beef was of the finely-shredded variety probably from a can, so don't expect chunks from a brisket they brined and carved themselves.  I'm not complaining - the stuff was tasty.  The two eggs on top were done a nice over easy.  I wasn't a fan of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, which tasted okay, but were a little too loose for me - like if you tried to scoop them with your fork instead of stabbing them, they would just fall off.  I like hash browns, home fries, etc. that stick together a bit so you can put them on the same bite as the CBH/egg/omelette/etc.  I can't believe it's just me.  Right?\n\nThe lady's country fried steak was tender and tasty.  Not out of this world, but certainly better than you'd get at an IHOP.  While I had wheat toast, she chose the banana muffin, which was great - just filling, so with the good portions of the rest of out breakfasts, we couldn't finish it.\n\nService was friendly, and the prices were reasonable.  I'd definitely come back."

It was 100+ degrees come 10:30am and we were waiting outside to be seated, luckily we didn't wait that long and managed to snag a seat at their patio (thank goodness their misters were on). The staff was amazing in accommodating our large party outside and they rocked taking all our orders and getting them out in a timely manner.\n\nI ordered their fresh vegetable (vegetarian) omelette with egg whites sans cheese with a side of potatoes. The omelette was pretty good, although nothing terribly mind-blowing and it came with spinach and mushrooms. The house potatoes were not my favorite, but still eatable. It had way too much seasoning making it very salty.\n\nThe food was decent overall, would like to come and try their scrambles the next time I'm in Vegas. :) Can't go wrong with affordable mom and pop restaurants off the Strip."

The line moves very fast, and you will be sitting down with a yummy warm banana muffin. Portions are big, and you will be stuffed. I tried the cincy chili for the first time. It's an all meat chili with a sweeter taste. Then I had the best loco moco ever! Instead of the usual brown gravy, they use country gravy. And their homemade hamburger patty has so much flavor, and cooked to perfection."

I didn't think it was going to be good but boy was i wrong!\n\nIt's located off the strip and driving past it i honestly would not have given it a second look. We saw the reviews and they were good. \n\nThe place had a nice crowd. We were greeted and seated immediately.\n\nOur waitress Tamara (who was helpful and awesome) suggested the Bandito Scramble. It had pepper jack, cheddar, sour cream, chorizo, jalape\u00f1os and of course eggs. It came with a spicy sauce on the side and breakfast potatoes. Oh my goodness, it was wonderful. Oh and it also came with an AMAZING banana nut muffin...pure perfection!\n\nAnother thing I liked on the menu that I didn't try was they had Cincinnati chili. I'm from Cincinnati and everybody knows chili is our thing. I'll be back before I leave to try it and get another banana nut muffin.\n\nMy husband did great finding this place!"

If you like salt, you would love this dish. The egg on top did help balance it out. I don't care for the country potatoes and should have gotten the hash browns. Fresh squeezed OJ with pulp, very refreshing. Service was surprisingly prompt for a pack house inside. Water was filled when needed. \n\nOn to the muffin - it's a winner, simply the best muffin i ever had and surprisingly with no salt added. It was banana nut but you wouldn't know by looking at it.  However, you can taste it. They should consider opening a muffin shop and just sell these as it would be a big seller imho. A 3.5 overall experience but I am rounding it up because of the tasty muffin and would come back again just for that."

Was crisp without too much grease. \n\nGreat customer service. \n\nI will be eating here again before I leave is how much I truly enjoyed my self. \n\nWife would want me to give it a 4.5 because they used too much cheese on her omelet however it said cheesy so I blame her."

Definitely worth the money but, not mind blowing. I would try their other items if I go again. My friend got the stuffed french toast and that looked very good.

It was approaching noon, but I still had my heart set on breakfast.  \n\nWe were seated quickly.  The service was ok. I don't know in what order the food went in or what, but this is what I noticed. \n\nThere were 2 tables in front of my view.  One table got seated 5 minutes after us and the other table seemed like they were wating forever for their food.  I'm assuming the manager, went up to the table and apologized for their food not getting there yet.  I then noticed the table who sat down 5 mintues AFTER us got served their food first.  I looked at the hubby and said, \"how did that happen?\" AND they were served way BEFORE the table that was waiting.  So something happened to communication from the servers and the kitchen.   \n\nI got the chicken fried steak.  When we got our food I was lovin' the potatoes!!  My scramble eggs were over cooked and hard - really no flavor.  My chicken fried steak was good, but the put sooo much gravy, I had to take half of it off.   \n\nOverall, the place is a good spot for breakfast in Vegas.

The prices are very reasonable and my breakfast inlcuding a drink came to a toal of $10.00. I will definitely be back on my next trip to LV."

            "review": "Let's be honest here: the whole Vegas breakfast buffet phenomenon gets really old really fast.  Yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  And how much do you want to eat every single morning?  Don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an \"I live to bingo\" sweater?\n\nIf you do, take a short drive down W. Sahara Ave to Egg and I.  You will not be disappointed.  Inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, Egg and I provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of The Strip.\n\nBy now you're probably wondering what \"Egg\" looks like.  Well, Egg looks kind of like Humpty Dumpty, and \"I\" looks just like \"Egg.\"  Just look on their website.  Might as well call the whole place \"2 Eggs,\" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  \n\nWe came in around 9:30 am on Saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  We got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  We had just gotten into town, and I was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  You'd better believe I took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  Even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.\n\nWe couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  Also, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.\n\nThere was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  The Ultimate Skillet is not for the weak...that much I know.  A generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a Cajun flavor to it.  Paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and delicious.  The Ultimate Skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions and cheese.  The skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  WOW.  \n\nWe also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3/4 of the skillet, I wasn't hankering for a pancake.  I did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  I was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  On any other day, I can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the Ultimate Skillet proved to be a bit much.  Order at your own risk.  That's a LOT of food for $9.95.\n\nGreat breakfast in a quaint setting?  I will be sure to make it my regular Vegas breakfast destination."

We did have a wait for about 40 minutes upon arrival as well. A local favorite. Combine tourists like us with locals, you got a busy place! Look in the 24/7 guide for a buy 1, get 1 entree free coupon. The banana nut muffin is served warm and is a must eat. We both got omelets - love the unique variety! The homestyle potatoes are super tasty and you get a generous portion. Fresh squeezed orange juice - a plus! The little black/yellow egg flipper as a service indicator is fun and helpful. Within seconds of flipping it to the black egg (meaning we needed service) the MANAGER was over at our table asking what we needed and joking with us. Everyone here is friendly, upbeat and happy you stopped in. Good place, good people. Go."

They prepare everything so fast too. The eggs are always cooked exactly how i want them and the pancakes are so fluffy.  The prices are a little bit higher than some lithe places i won't name but everything is always good here.  It get packed on the weekends."

The only negative is that their coffee is low grade, just barely drinkable.  Its certainly worth the 10 minute drive for better food and lower prices than what you can find on the Strip."
