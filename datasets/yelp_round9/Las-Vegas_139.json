Not the best, but definitely not the worst :) This is a great place to hang out with a few friends but be aware the music is very loud sometimes. \n\nHappy Hour is 5-7pm and is only offered in the lounge area. That means you get a ton of food at a great deal! \n\nVeggie dolmas are good so is the baba, hummus, falafel...I don't care for bread (any bread) so they bring me sliced cucumbers to dip instead. \n\nWe have always had great service. I can't think of any complaints at all. They even keep an eye on our coals and are always refilling water (the tap they serve is horrible for some reason here). They check up on you without being annoying. \n\nOrder some Skittles hookah, pig out, drink some yummy tea, and relax."

            "review": "My girly and I are visiting from out of town and came about seeing this place all over yelp so we had to give it a shot!\n\nThe place itself is decorated very nicely. It has loads of paintings on the wall, beautiful curtains, and is lit with extravagant chandeliers. The hookah itself is fair. The first night we came, we tried the skittles flavor which wasn't bad, it just didn't hit very hard where a lot of smoke would come out. The second night we tried the thief flavor, which was my personal favorite of the two; which again, didn't hit too hard, but did taste very good. At some point in the night, I felt we needed new coals for our hookah, and the waitress told me they don't change coals, you have to buy a new refill for coals which to me is a little ridiculous (and that's an understatement). The music they play is a combination of reguaetton, cumbia, and top 40's. I actually enjoyed the music a lot. Also, on Friday nights they have a dance floor availible. I didn't go about trying the food, but if I do come back, I might just do that.\n\nOverall; to me, this place is more bark than bite, it has a very well decorated lounge, and has fair hookah. The customer service isn't terrible, but I can see them doing more fir the customer."

Well I couldn't stay away any longer and boy am I glad I decided to go back!\n\nOh have I missed their delicious wonderful food...\n\nI went here with my friend TracieP for lunch the other day, she had never been here and I finally got her to go after bragging about their Penne Pesto Pasta for months. \nSo we both ordered the Pesto Pasta and we also ordered the Athens fries as an appetizer. The fries were well seasoned and I absolutely love the dipping sauce they serve with it. The pasta was creamy goodness in my mouth by far the best pesto ive ever had just as I had remembered. \n\n*Delicious food \n*Good prices\n*Great service\n\nIf you havent tried this place please do and please order the Penne Pesto Pasta if your a fan of pesto it is mouth watering delicious."

I Liked the Penne a lot, but it was a lot of food for me. I'd maybe have preferred half the amount of penne and has salad instead, but the eggplant parmesan was SO GOOOOOD!!\nI really enjoy the atmosphere too."

An extra plus is the abundant portions of food at reasonable prices. Two could very easily share an entree and still have leftovers. Best iced tea in the valley!"

The chicken was cooked just right and the flavors from the tahini and herbs were delicious. The rice added just the right touch and I even threw some in my pita. \n\nNot much else to say about the place... was my first time and due to the weather it was pretty quiet. Seems like they have a cool little bar area in the back but I did feel like they need to do a little updating of the decor in the main seating area.\n\nI'll be back for the food and hopefully some nicer weather!"

My mother in law and brother in law had and spoke highly of it, so tonight was our night to give it a try.\n\nIt was a bit busy, there were several big tables reserved and/or seated already, but we were able to get a table.  We started with a couple of apps, the first were the Athen's fries, it had been given many good reviews, but they were just well seasoned fries with a dipping sauce other than ketchup.  The second app was the a combination of hummus and baba ganosh, now these were both good!\n\nFor my entree I ordered Moussaka, it was a layered casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, ground beef, fresh herbs and spices, covered with behamel sauce and served on basmati rice and vegetables.  I really enjoyed this.\n\nOverall, a good experience, service was excellent, the food was flavorable and met my expectations, but a bit pricey ."

A few rounds of drinks, some great Athens fries, some stuffed grape leaves and a plate of calamari later...What else can you ask for. Hmmm the mad hatter, that's what. The local hookah master took good care of us refilling our hashish right when we needed it. We went from mint to the mad hatter and I have to say, The Mad Hatter takes the cake. \n\nTonight was the happy hour in the hookah lounge and it makes it very very affordable, the decor was done well, the light is kept low and the music is turned up as the night goes on. The place has a slight clubbish vibe when it comes to the music and the atmosphere which was nice. The music was loud but not obnoxious, we could still carry on a conversation without screaming. From looking at the regular menu I can see that the food may be a little pricey when not on happy hour but this is now a Tuesday happy hour favorite for me."

            "review": "Paymons is definitely my favorite spot off The Strip.  Bf n I were looking for the best hookah bars in Vegas, and we came across Paymons.  We have tried Rhumbar and Azuza also, but they just dont compare!\n\nWe arrived at around 11:30pm, and the restaurant was very empty.  The lounge was nearly full, bumpin 80s music with a live DJ.  The seats were very comfortable, bf was very happy.  The service was great too, very nice girls and friendly to all their patrons.\n\nWe just came from a concert, so we were starving.  Bf ordered the Tandoori Chicken and loved it.  I ordered the gyro plate which also came with their signature Athens Fries... HOLY MOLY forget the fries, the GYRO was awesome!  In Hawaii, all Greek and Mediterranean food is pretty standard and nothing mind-blowing.  Paymons serves a JUMBO gyro and they do not skimp on ANY ingredients.  Loved it, but I couldnt finish it.  \n\nWe read about the Thief flavor shisha, and we ordered a bowl of that.  There was margarita mixed with several other flavors.  It was tasty! We also ordered a bowl of the Cherry Bomb shisha, which I thought tasted a lot better, more flavorful.  \n\nThere was a lot of funky music playing, and the music videos for the songs were also on the TVs on the walls.  This lounge is spacious and has a great vibe, dont be shy to get up and dance! \n\nOnly thing I would have changed is to not sit near the A/C vent so I can do my smoke tricks...lol\n\nI definitely want to come back again, but with a bigger group, its a great late-nite spot to get away from The Strip and just have fun."

The bag just made it seem cheap and reminded me of a fast food restaurant. Plus the bag did not prevent my pita from falling apart, and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife.  \n\nThere are no lunch specials, so expect to pay full dinner prices.  The pita sandwiches, which are close to $10, do not come with ANY sides and fries are extra."

            "review": "Paymon's (on Sahara) has gone from being a \"treat\" to more of a stand-by neighborhood restaurant, as my wife and 2 kids (10 & 7) enjoy ethnic and different places to eat.  And, what used to look like a pretty daunting restaurant (I mean, with the Hookah Lounge tag on the name and the rather imposing storefront), has become like a coffee shop or diner for us...and that's mostly a good thing.\n\nI like the huge menu, and the ability to pick from Italian, Persian, Greek, and Indian (albeit only 3 choices) selections.  On Wednesdays, it's 25% off your entire tab, a great value!  Not being subscribers of local papers and always tossing out the ad-paks that come in the mail, I haven't seen all the 'coupons' mentioned by others.  So what about the food?\n\nDecent job of the Chicken Curry - and the spice-to-taste option is great.  My 10-yr old enjoys it mild; I love it spiced to the max!  She wishes they put potatoes in the curry, but with the wonderful rice-bed that the curry sits on, I think she can live without the potatoes.  Maybe some veggies (besides the cursory onions) would make it a little more interesting, but hey, this isn't the Red Velvet Vegan Cafe (just down the street a bit).\n\nPaymon's Greek platters are also good - Gyros platter, Baked Kibbe platter, etc.  I wish the Kibbe wasn't quite as \"moist\", and retained more of the beef texture, but it's still quite good.  I think the Athens Fries is a bit overrated - a little too salty for my taste.  I also enjoy the Fesenjan (Chicken breast cuts in a slightly tart/sweet yummy pomengranate sauce), but it wasn't to my wife's liking.  Your experience will very much vary depending on how you take to the specific spices used in each dish, so ask the server to elaborate.\n\nThe service is good, almost family-like, unless they are packed.  Then, a certain level of panic seems to set in, and it becomes hard to flag down your server.  Funny - I still like restaurants where the person who took your order is the same person who brings your food.  Sometime about 10 years ago, I think most \"big box restaurants\" adopted a serving method where someone more junior and less experienced than the person who took your order always brings out the food...and you lose the chance to question the food at the moment it arrives.  That is definitely a pet peeve of mine...especially when your original server who heard your specific requests doesn't come around until at least 5-10 minutes after another person has dropped the plates of food in front of you!  Annoying!  BUT...this doesn't happen at Paymon's!\n\nPortions are large enough that I don't recall having room for dessert yet at Paymon's.  All in all, Paymon's is a handy restaurant to have close by.  They stay open to 11 pm every night, so no rushing down by 8 pm to try and make it.  Since our family has no interest in the Hookah Lounge, we don't even see the area to the left of the entrance.  The atmosphere inside is a slightly cheesy cross between Istanbul and the Taj Mahal, but it's not overbearing, and kind of grows on you.  Those who tend to always be cold should bring a sweater...unless you're going to be eating the extra-spiced version of the Chicken Curry!"

Their happy hour goes late too, 4-7 pm which is great for people who tend to work late like me. This location is also much bigger then the Maryland one which makes it easier to find a table. \n\nOn my most recent visit I decided to go with the traditional hummus, stuffed grape leaves and dolmas. I liked the hummus but felt it could have been a bit for flavorful. The dolmas and grape leaves however were great. The flavors are bold and nicely complimented with a gyro type sauce. I also recommend trying the fries and calamari here!"

Lots of good eats, great conversation, service and atmosphere.  The perfect mix of Greek, Indian, some Italian and I loved that there were a ton of Vegetarian options!\n\nAppetizers:\nI had the infamous Athens Fries, which lived up to their reputation.  The spice really added to the fries and the sauce was delish.   I kept trying to figure out what was in the sauce as if I were at a wine tasting.. lol..  never did figure it out, but well worth it!  \nThe hummus with pesto sauce was bomb.  Adding the pesto sauce probably took away from the healthy factor, but, when in Rome...\n\nEntrees:\nI ordered the Chicken Curry (mild) and my other half had the Chicken Tandoori.  The flavors were perfect and not overly spicy.  We were both part of the clean plate club.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't leave room for dessert.  I highly regretted this when I got home.  Next time, I must indulge.  Mama's Baklava is calling my name.  \n\nAs far as drinks, they had a great wine list, a killer margarita and their unsweetened tea was so good, it was almost as if it were sweetened.  As a southerner, I'm not a fan of iced unsweetened tea, but they make it work!  There were also a variety of warm tea to choose from.. Lots of green tea, Mango, Earl Grey, Spiced Chai, etc..etc..  A perfect way to end a meal!\n\nThe service was perfect!  We were a large party (around 20 peeps) and I don't think there was a single hiccup.  I was also impressed with how the server was able to effortlessly split about fifteen different tabs.  If only I could remember his name!  Shame on me.\n\nI didn't check out the Hookah Lounge; Shisha tends to give me a headache.  Maybe next time.\n\nGreat food!  I'll be back!"

So, it's really a matter of where we are when we get that Mediterranean craving and we love Paymons.\n\nMy favorites:\nCombination Platter ($13.95)\nMoussaka ($13.95)\nBroiled Kabob Trio ($20.95)\n\nAll of their flame-broiled meats are packed with flavor and so very yummy with their basmati rice and house salad. I love the trio platter since it comes with three types of meat that are cooked with different seasonings (I hate to decide and I just love the variety). I feel the same way about the Combination Platter. It comes with EIGHT different items! It's the best dish to order if you want to try multiple specialties or just sharing with the table.

The hostess was unfriendly but, lucky for her, I was distracted by the restaurant's decor. Big. fan. For my 1st time, I was pleased to be there during the sweet-spot of the evening where I got to see what it was like with all the natural light from the skylights then the dim lighting once the sun set. The chairs were a pleasant surprise- they have a little give when you lean back in them. \u00dcber comfy. Unlike the hostess, our waitress was very friendly. We ordered their fries & mozzarella sticks for appetizers- not a single complaint! Later, with our entr\u00e9es, we had some sides of tzatziki that I enjoyed dipping the fries in more than the standard sauce. I ordered the beef kabobs, at the recommendation of our waitress- it came with a small side salad & basmati rice. All very tasty! My g.f. got the gyro salad with a side of tzatziki, in addition to the dressing- I had a nibble of the salad & would definitely order it. Because I fell in love with the baklava, on a previous Yelpventure at Petra, I HAD to try Paymons'! Obviously, now I think I'm an expert &, in my expert opinion, the baklava at Paymon's is good but Petra's could take it out to the monkey bars & beat it up. Even so, I'll absolutely return to Paymon's & I'll probably even save room for dessert."

I've been to Paymons several times in the past.\n\nTonight it was a bit loud, with a large group nearby who were basically yelling because the music was a bit too high. The music was electronic, and for the first hour it felt like the same song, over and over and over again. Drop the volume level and pick a new song....geez. Eventually some DJ came on and the music got a little better, but by that time we were just about to head out the door.\n\nService is good, shisha is good...not as many varieties and flavors as Azuza. Paymons is a nice spot to hang out and enjoy a little smoke. They might be the only place on the westside that offers Hookah and serves alcohol, as all the other places we searched did not offer booze."

I found this place originally because it came up high in a Google search result by zip-code for Vegan restaurants.\n\nThe menu is an interesting and very unique \"fusion\" between several different cultures, and is so varied you could come in 100 times and have 100 different meals before you run through all the options.\n\nAlthough I don't make it to this part of town very often, when I do come in, almost every time there is at least one staffperson who remembers my name and my meal choice (I'm one of those guys who goes to a few select places and orders the same thing every time).  Impressive because I'm not exactly Norm at Cheers when it comes to this place, and it shows they make a genuine effort to appreciate customers.\n\nWhenever I have visitors in town, I try to bring them here if time or schedule permits."

There are plenty of seating tables for a group of friends to chill on couches, get some great drinks, and listen to cool music (mix of hip hop, to club, to even some dubstep when I was there). There is a heated patio area also very nice to get away from the music to have more intimate convo's. Inside has a real bohemian type of feel with cool drapery as well as hookah available.  It's a great place to chill with friends, maybe even a date when you want to avoid the strip.

A bowl is ~$15 and a refill is like ~$8 I think. They have a variety of flavors. I remember when the whole no smoking where food is served thing was around. Paymon's complied for a sec, but then reverted back. \n\nSometimes we get picky about how hot the coal is or how the shisha is burning, but the smoke boy comes around and makes it all better. \n\nThe drinks are okay-priced. If you ask for a water, they'll give you a tiny Fiji for like $5. I think the food prices are reasonable, though. Get the app combo platter (classy, huh?) for $11 to feed a non-ravenous group of three. Baklava and rice pudding are vera nice. \n\nOn the weekends, the lounge fills up. I've seen the restaurant side get busy, but not packed. The lounge is open late, but not late enough. 1a every night. \n\nThe lounge is lowkey and chill. Its perfect for the nights you want to get out of the house, but not deal with the crowds or yelling over loud music. Sometimes they play Middle Eastern jams. Sometimes its like club electronica. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"

The happy hour all day Tuesday was the best with half off hookahs and lots of drinks to choose from.\n\nNowadays, I hardly ever go here, because the hookahs are always burnt and die really fast. The service is lacking now - I literally have to wave my hands in the air and do a little dance to get someone's attention. The drink refills dont come fast anymore so I'm always contemplating if I should just order two drinks instead of one. \n\nI used to like the other location on Maryland Pkway better, but I always came here due to distance. The other location is just the same now - the hookahs arent's as great. I'd advise you to just smoke at home where you'd get the best service haha"

The comfy bench seating and throw pillows always make me feel at home. The only think I don't like is the tables and chairs made for little people. I am 5'10\" and the boyfriend is 6'5\" so when we go with a group of friends it is always a bit cramped. However, when it's just me and him we spread out comfortably. \n\nThe hookahs are always smooth and tasty, at $15 each it doesn't get any better. I have tried hookahs at bars and clubs in town and they were no where near Paymon's standards and are usually double the price! \n\nThe food is pretty good as well, I am not much into Mediterranean food except maybe hummus. The pesto hummus at Paymon's is delicious! You cannot go wrong with their \"Athens Fries\", the spices that they use to season the fries are out of this world! The drinks are so/so every specialty drink I have had has been overpowering or not the right flavor combinations so I stick to beer or pellegrino most of the time.\n\nThe service is hit or miss, sometimes it is excellent and other times we are waiting 45 min for a hookah or 30 min for drink refills. I guess it depends on who serves you. \n\nPaymon's happy hour is one of the best in town with $7.50 hookahs and half off drinks and appetizers. Tuesdays are locals nights where happy hour goes from 5pm-1am, just make sure you get there early since the place fills up fast!"

Paymon's being one of them, but after last night I'll think twice about coming here. \n\nFirst and foremost I may say Paymon's has an excellent happy hour. The service is usually terrible in the lounge area but we deal with it because it's a pretty awesome atmosphere. Being huge fans of Hookah and living in Summerlin, this location is usually our go to spot when we don't want to drive all the way down to The Olive Hookah Lounge. Food wise, the hummus and the stuffed grape leaves are awesome! The fries are so good that I have to talk myself out of getting them most of the time haha. Hookah wise we love the peach flavor.\n\nNow for last night...  We came in with a few friends and I was wearing a Chargers baseball cap. The waitress (after taking our drink orders) told me I was not allowed to wear a hat. Now the very last time we came in I was wearing  the exact same hat. Very confused I asked her what the issue was. She said there were no hats allowed in the restaurant / lounge. Now I find this pretty insane. We are long time paying customers of Paymon's and I was being asked to leave over wearing a sports team baseball cap? I'm still pretty taken back by this, even now. We all ended up leaving and I probably won't return. It's such a shame."

The decor in the lounge is absolutely stunning and immediately puts you in a loungey, relaxy mood as you take a seat. This place is what I feel a true hookah lounge embodies. All the other ones I've been to around here and Cali have nothing on this lounge. With that said, the one on Maryland Pkwy is the same, just smaller and more narrow in size.\n\nDuring my many visits here for about the past 10 years, I've had the pleasure of trying a few dishes whilst drinking and smoking in the lounge. Some of my faves here are: moussaka, lamb kabobs, beef kabobs, calamari, Athens fries, hummus, to name a few. I can't remember not liking anything I've tried here.\n\nIf you get here during happy hour, the specialty drinks and appetizers are half off. And they do not skimp here. You can order a full size calamari app for under $5 and they are some of the best I've ever had.\n\nThe service is always super friendly but they do get overwhelmed when it gets busier at night. This is a fact I've come to live with when visiting Paymon's but the relaxed feel when I'm here makes it a non-issue for me.\n\nEvery time I come here, it's always great times and great memories. This is a must-do when I have friends in from out of town. I'm so glad we have such a beautiful place like this in Las Vegas that is off the Strip."

The decor is great and it was obvious that people were having a great time in the hookah lounge. \n\nThe food was probably the worst I've had in the area, and I don't say that lightly. We ordered the appetizer sampler, which was lackluster. I'd rather buy hummus from the store. The fries were pretty gross - couldn't place the spices they used, but definitely not my taste. The falafel was alright but I've had better. \n\nMy friend ordered the kabob sampler. The lamb was OK, nothing to get excited about. I didn't care for the chicken much either. Something about it didn't sit right with me. \n\nThe deal breaker was the ground beef kabobs. My only description of them wouldn't be appropriate, so let's just call them straight up nasty. They were warm and cooked on the outside but the insides were cold and total mush. I have never sent back food in my life, but I can only imagine the sickness that would result if I didn't. When they came back, they were practically burnt on the outside (as kabobs should be I guess?) and the insides were slightly more solid. I've had kabobs at plenty of other places in town and in my travels, but I never have experienced this. SUCH a disappointment... It was really gross. The rice was ok but tasted really greasy, and the stewed tomato thing on the side tasted slightly of soap. The waitress offered to send it back a 2nd time but at that point I was over it and the thought of eating more turned my guts. I didn't ask for it to be removed from the bill, but they did it anyway, which was nice.\n\nI'd go back to try out their hookah lounge and have drinks, but I'll be avoiding the food. I hope it was just a fluke but not willing to dump money down the drain again."

The dcor is fitting of a Mediterranean theme, and I especially enjoy the collection of small shoes hung about the room. There is so much to look, one could lose track of time inside. The windows are blacked out, and warm colors fill the room to add to the time distortion. There are about eight tables and two big booths for your hookah party. The best part is that they serve food from the restaurant side. A small bar is located toward the back, and one of their rinks was featured on $40 a Day with Rachael Ray. I can't remember the name, but it is tropical and sweet, and if you asked, I'm sure they would know which one you were talking about. It pairs nicely with a fruity hookah too.

It was absolutely delicious and has a wide variety of menu offerings.  I love the freshly wrapped grape leaves.  The chilled leaves have just the right amount of citrus and are firm.  \n\nThe lentil soup is savory and well balanced.  The soup itself can be very filling as a light meal.\n\nThe Athens fries.  Where do I start?  These fries are always served hot and thick.  They aren't too starchy and are coated with Paymon's proprietary spice blend.  They are served with a delicious sauce.\n\nThe spanikopita portion is huge.  The phyllo is flaky and the filling is rich and creamy.\n\nThe salmon tandoori comes complete with a huge mound of rice.  The salmon is plump and tender, cut into large cubes.  The tangy seasoning is great and well balanced.\n\nPersonally, I opt for the combination platter.

I'm usually really into pomegranate concoctions, so I was sold as soon as I read the description. To be honest, I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it was a tad too sweet.\n\nI also had their Passion Fruit Iced Tea. I remember having that last time and it is definitely my go-to drink whenever I return. On a side note, my friend ordered the Chicken Curry. She is hardcore when it comes to spicy food. She asked the waiter to make it as spicy as possible. I tried it and it definitely kicked my butt.\n\nPaymon's has a lot of charm. The servers are extremely accommodating and friendly. When they say Mediterranean, they mean it. I always thought they were primarily Persian, but they offer Greek, Italian, and I'm sure other cuisine styles that I haven't bothered to identify.\n\nIt's not a place I would go to often. However, I would never hesitate whenever someone makes the suggestion."

Although a decent HH choice, they will serve their full menu in the lounge.\n\nMy favorite is their curry chicken and tandoori chicken.  You can choose a spice level for the curry as well.   I like the chicken better from the tandoori and love dipping it in the curry sauce.  However, they charge something like $5 for sauce on the side so I find it a better deal just to order an entire curry chicken meal.  The saffron rice is the best.\n\nIn the past I've had also had their HH athens fries, chicken wings and hummus.  Not the best for your waist line but definitely satisfying for the belly."

I also like the baba ganosh (eggplant blended w/tahini, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice)  as far as entrees, i always order either the  pastitsio ( a casserole filled w/ground beef, pasta, tomato, and cheese) or moussaka (a casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, and ground beef).  i'm always too full to eat dessert, but i finish my dinner off with some dark rich sweetened turkish coffee....\n."

(RIP Madpita Express *sniff sniff*) I would really give it 3.5 stars so I rounded up. The prices are high for what you get. The salads are a deal though, as you can easily share them. The Gyro salad is huge and pretty tasty. The gyro pita sandwich however doesn't fare as well. We always have to ask for more tahini sauce because of the minuscule amount they put on it. The sandwich is honestly mostly lettuce, very little meat. The pasta I've had there wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't anything I have reordered since. I tried the pesto sauce with angel hair pasta. The pesto lacked flavor and was too heavy for my liking. The food here isn't amazing by any means, but it's sufficient for a nice business lunch."

Realistically, probably more 3.5 but let's not split hairs.\n\nThe hostess was fantastic as soon as we walked in. She was friendly and alerted us to a nice booth that was just opening up, instead of just sticking us at any table.\n\nOur waiter was very familiar with all the dishes and recommended his favorites, as well as commented on the wines we were considering.\n\nNoticed that they have a 1/2 portion menu for a limited time that includes some of their huge portion items (like the Spanakopita).\n\nThis evening we opted for the small Indian section of the menu (I know, Indian at a Mediterranean restaurant??)  The Chicken Tandoori was very tender and the Mango Chutney dipping sauce superb.  The portion was perfect also. The Chicken Curry dish was excellent, although I would have preferred more chicken. That was my only knock on the meal, although for the price I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nThe atmosphere is quite nice.

From what I see in the pictures, the Hookah lounge is gorgeous, but I didn't get to see it since we were just here for lunch. The waitress sat us in a booth a quickly brought out our water and told us what she recommended. \n\nWe ordered:\nFried Calamari ($9.50) - Topped with grated parmesan cheese and served with spicy marinara sauce.\n\nPastitsio ($12.95) - layered casserole made with lean ground beef, Barilla pasta, tomato, parmesan cheese, and several herbs and spices. Topped with bechamel sauce, oven baked and served on a roasted tomato coulis. Served with Mediterranean vegetables.\n\nGyro ($8.75) - Slices of beef and lamb, served with fresh romaine lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and Greek tzatziki sauce.\n+Athens fries for $2.95 extra\n\nTo be honest, I found this all to be a little overpriced. Our bill came out to be over $40 with tip because we also ordered iced tea and a soda. However, the food was very good. The meat in the Gyro was very tender and the fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I don't know what kind of dipping sauce they gave us with the Athens fries, but it was addicting. The Pastitsio was very flavorful although a little too heavy for my liking, so I probably wouldn't order it again. The calamari was heavenly; Lightly breaded, tender, and oozing with flavor Parmesan/herb goodness. The marinara sauce was an added bonus. I normally prefer my Calamari with marinara as opposed to aioli. \n\nIf it weren't for the regular menu being a tad overpriced, I would give this place an easy 4 stars. I just don't think I can justify the Gyro and fries being about $12 and the Calamari being $9.50. I'll have to come back again during happy hour when Calamari is only $4.75, so I can add on another star ;)\n\n*Tips\n-Customer Appreciation Night: Wednesdays from 5-9pm, 25% off bill\n-Tuesdays: from 5pm-1am all specialty cocktails, beer, mixed drinks, hookahs and lounge food at 50% off\n-AYCE pasta for $8.95"

They have loose leaf tea which is a plus, but the dinner entrees that myself and the rest of my party ordered were equivalent to overpriced Mediterranean fast food.\n\nOrdered a chicken pita. It was alright, nothing extraordinary. Chicken was a bit dry and there was a lot of it, which explains why the pita was served in a paper wrap with printed instructions on how to eat it, so as to avoid a food explosion. It could have benefited from a bit more veggies and tsatziki, as there were only a few lettuce leaves and a sparse amount of tomato and sauce.\n\nThe others in our party ordered a brushcette salad with chicken that was also dry with very bitter and overdressed romaine. There were also quite a few lettuce stems in the salad which is quite bizarre. A broiled steak kabob was also ordered. Again nothing extraordinary for the price. Rice was very salty, the green beans with tomato sauce were reminiscent of something you'd find in a geriatric cafeteria.\n\nService was also painfully slow and one waitress was arguing with what appeared to be her boyfriend. Despite that, our waiter was polite and took the salad off of our check."

(As he should have, as he was extremely rude to my feedback. i will go and post screen shots of his original reply when i get some time. \n---------------------------------------------------\n***2nd updated review: Here's an update to my review below. I tried to comment back to Jeff E. from this business but Yelp wouldn't let me for some reason. So this explains why the staff was rude, as you all can see below the Business Manger is rude himself in his reply. Not once, did I get an apology for his staff being rude or making us feel uncomfortable. Note, I am a first time customer and a potential client, obviously he doesn't care. In his review he didn't post about how we where addressed by the bus lady. Our own waiter didn't even enforce the dress code or anything. \n\nAnd our bad on the \"garlic fries\" when he asked the server about them we where told the following, \"We stopped serving those\" which indicates or conveys you once had them to a new customer like myself. So if you don't serve garlic fries or \"never have\", then please Jeff, educate your staff to let people know that, so they can respond correctly to customers. \n\nIf you enforce a dress code regardless of race, or gender then all of your employees should enforce it, not just the bus lady, but your hostess who sat us AND the waiter who served us who said nothing to us. Please understand it felt like we where being picked on because after us sitting there for 2 hours smoking hookah and spending money on drinks no one said anything. I understand the dress code is posted but it was late and dark so we did not see it. Your host, and waiter said nothing to us. It would have been better to be addressed earlier, then 2 hours in, from a bus lady clearing our plates after we are done and about to leave. Please note, unlike the other customer, who was asked to remove his baseball cap \"3 times\" as soon as where we asked we cooperated and removed the hat. The point I am trying to make is we where addressed rudely about the baseball cap. Threated even, \"if we do not remove it we have to leave,\" but the guy across from us is allowed to be asked 3 times and us only once? That is not right.\n\nAnd I think that that's great you have a way to buy shirts if someone has no sleeves, but if its NOT about race or gender, then why are the females allowed to wear sleeveless tops and sleeveless dresses in there? I myself had a tube top on that night, and no one made me \"pay for sleeves or a shirt.\" If you are going to have a dress code, then all should abide by it then. Not just males. Women should too if that is what the dress code is. But again, it seems this place only caters to the \"regulars\" based the response below that I got. :-/  so I guess it doesn't matter. \n\n\n---Old review: My friends wanted to come in for the \"garlic fries\" only to find out they no longer serve them. We sat there for about 2 hours smoking hookah. Then some bus lady out of no where tells my boyfriend \"you need to take off your hat or get out.\" First off, we have been sitting here for 2 hours and now it's an issue? Second of all I understand a dress code but the way she approached us and ask was rude. Simple. I then looked around and saw other people with baseball caps on as well. So we asked if my boyfriend needs to remove his baseball cap then so should the others. The bus lady / clean up lady claims she asked the other guy to remove it 3 times. I find it funny that she can supposedly ask someone to remove a hat 3 times and it's ok. But of course she asked my boyfriend once or her would be \"kicked out\" after 2 hours of sitting somewhere come on. So anyways my guy took off his hat. As we're waiting for our check there was a guy next to us and he had a regular black tee shirt on. They told him He has to have a \"proper shirt on or get out\" they then had him come over to the bar and \"pay a shirt fee\" wtf??!! This place is wayyyyy to worried about baseball hats and plain tees on certain people. If you know what I mean... If you guys are going to have a \"dress code\" it should be the same for everyone. No matter race or gender. Example: they let people in wearing sweats and work out clothes but worry about hats and plain tees? Come on now."

I am working here as an ALT, so I'm going to be here for a while.  I'm going to get my last reviews in because I miss Yelp, and wish I could yelp some of the great places I've been to here in Japan.\n\n(Sorry for that tangent... on to the review!)\n\nI came to Paymon's about a month ago when I was supervising a group of international students to Sin City.  Echoing my previous reviews, I find that the best restaurants and treasures in Vegas definitely come from the locals, and it wasn't long before buddy Francis C. took me here for a late lunch.\n\nPaymon's specializes in Mediterranean caf\u00e9 style foods- a cuisine I've never really touched before, so my choices here were definitely on the safe side.  Conveniently located a few blocks away from the Strip, Paymon's offers a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice meal, as well as a hookah bar right next door (however, you must be 21 or older to enter).  When we went, we sat in between the restaurant and the bar in this extremely nice patio area, where natural sunlight was where it was at.\n\nService that day was decent.  We placed a few orders of fries, and I ordered the chicken marsala for my hefty meal.  Our food took a bit for it to come out, which confused us because a couple of other parties received theirs before ours (and we felt it was a pretty small meal).  When I finally received my chicken marsala, I was ready to sink my mouth into that piece of chicken.   In terms of the taste, the flavors didn't do much for me.  It wasn't bad at all, but nothing about my meal struck me.  The piece of fried chicken breast was okay, and my sauce over the noodles were simply average.  However, they do give a good sized portion for you hungry gamblers out there.\n\nEven though my meal wasn't completely mind-blowing, I did enjoy the French fries and the on-and-off lighting inside the patio.  Next time I come, I will definitely venture off and try the more Mediterranean options that Paymon's is known for.\n\nParking is plentiful outside in a private lot with other businesses."

The pita was good, but the bottom was pure lettuce, no sauce or anything. The sauce up top was good too. Kind of tasted like a spicy peppercorn or spicy Bleu cheese (idk). The gyro platter was okay. Salad was really good and the rice. The meat was good, but very grenade. My husband couldn't eat it all because of that. Otherwise, it was pretty decent for our first trip there. I also like the fact the hookah area is separate from the dining area. Good idea!!"

I had the Curry Chicken, she had the Chicken Kabob thingys with humus.  We split an order of the Athens Fries (I got the reference for the fries from other reviewers. They were pretty awesome) and got a bottle of wine.  The food was delicious, the wine was perfect for the food, and we had leftovers to take back to enjoy later. After dinner we went to the adjoining room and got a spot to smoke some hookah.  2 friends joined us to smoke and we all sat around talked and had some drinks also.  The dirty martini with Belvidere vodka was probably the best one Ive ever had from anywhere.  The atmosphere in there was awesome, the music never got annoying, and we had a great time.  The only thing I would change about this place is I would keep it open later than 1am.  I wish they had a place like this in Long Beach. Maybe Ill open one like it someday."

The decor was nice, I liked the outside patio.\n\n After reading the reviews we ordered a side of Athens fries and hummus.  The fries are amazing especially with the dipping sauce. The hummus was fine however the pita bread was not so good.  The bread tasted as if it was reheated prepackaged bread not freshly made.   \n\nFor the main dishes we ordered the steak kabobs- medium and the gyros platter. Both were very tasty the steak was good quality meat and of big portion size.   They both came with rice and vegetables however I found the white rice to be bland tasting.\n\nOverall the service was fast and our waiter always made sure we were taken care of.   It would of been 5 stars if it was not for the pita bread!"

A dolma is a grape leaf filled with seasoned beef and rice baked in tomato sauce. This is the closest one I can find to the ones I ate during my childhood. \n\nI had the Fesenjan for my entree ($12.95). It's a boneless chicken breast that is slow cooked with crushed walnuts and pomegranate sauce. It's served with basamati rice. I typically don't like eating a lot of chicken because I'm afraid it would be bland but this was bursting with flavor! It has a tangy sweet flavor to it. \n\nI also sampled their combination platter ($13.95) which comes with Hummus, Tabuli, stuffed grape leaves, falfel, yogurt cucumber dip, baba ganosh and Athens fries.

I tried it tonight with my boyfriend and we left satisfied. \n\nWe were greeted warmly as we entered and were sat within 4 minutes. We already knew what we wanted to try so when our server came to get our drinks we also ordered our meal. We tried the Kabob Trio which was basically white basmati rice, brown basmati rice, chicken kabobs (their chicken was flavorful and really juicy!) , beef kabobs (they were SOOOOO GOOOD! Like melted in my mouth good!), and lamb kabobs (THE BEST lamb I've ever had. Not gamy, filled with flavor, cooked perfectly medium ), yogurt mix which complimented the lamb kabobs the best in my opinion, Greek salad, along with roasted onions and tomato. \n\nThe food was so delicious and the service was good enough that I would definitely come back. I would give a 5 star, but the service wasn't as amazing as the food. I'd recommend this to friends and families. The interior was pretty, had a nice relaxing ambience. And the hookah lounge at the other room looked pretty as well! It's a must try for next time.\n\nThe icing on the cake for this place was that we got our food at a discounted rate and we didn't even know it was happening. The Kabob Trio is usually 20 dollars plus tax, but I guess they have a sale going on on Wednesdays. So instead of paying 20, we paid 16 dollars for the massive Kabob Trio :) \n\nLove this place, would try and recommend."

My boyfriend and i were in the market for a new happy hour to check out, so i found this place on my mobile app. Regretting it greatly now.\nFirst regret, the specialty cocktails. Margaritas were ridiculously too sweet, and i read through the ingredients. They use a mix i have used before, so i'm not sure how those got screwed up... and I'm a bartender. \nNext, we ordered the hummus as a starter, and it arrived surprisingly fast. Downside however was it was depressingly bland and oozy, not thick or flavorful at all. We figured oh well, the entrees should make up for it.\nI ordered the gyro pita, accompanied by athens fries, my boyfriend got the pesto pizza. I couldn't pick up the thing, cuz it would probably fall apart, so i proceeded to make little mini pitas by tearing pieces of it and putting the meat, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce inside, very messy. I now realize that we were never given settings or napkins. Since my boyfriend had to go looking for our server a couple times, i said to hell with it and got some paper hand towels from the bathroom. My server saw me come back with said towels, and said nothing to us or checked in still.\nBack to the food. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something was way off with the gyro meat, a little too 'chewy' i suppose, and barely warm.. the fries weren't really anything to write home about. My boyfriend said his pizza was basic and bland also.\nThe only time server finally checks on us, he rudely interrupted my boyfriend and i having a moment. We asked for a box and the check. In all honestly the only reason for the box was to give the food to the dogs.\nThe check arrived, and we were thrown for a loop. I have no problem paying for a quality fare, but we were under the impression that most of our items were on happy hour pricing. Nope. 2 drinks, hummus, pizza and my gyro came out to 50 bucks, wtf. I then got on here and learned that happy hour pricing was only on Tuesday nights. Another thing i came across in these reviews was that Weds nights are customer appreciation night and they take 25% off the final check.  Again, didn't happen.\nWe were over it at this point and just wanted to vacate. Again, my boyfriend had to go looking for our server,  who he said gave him an irritated look when we needed change. I always leave 20% as i am in the industry, and can understand that not all issues are the service staffs fault. In this case I'll admit I lowballed.\nTo make it even better, as we were getting some stuff at the gas station on the way home, i rapidly became unbearably nauseas and ran outside to throw up. Definitely won't be caught here again, i don't even think i feel safe giving the hounds the food anymore... that's bad."

Tuesdays they have all-day happy hour in the lounge (which means half-price hookah, drinks, and some appetizers)! It gets a bit crowded which may not be for everyone, but I think it makes for a more fun vibe. They tend to start playing electronic music later in the night on Tuesdays as well (I have heard they also do this on weekends).\n\nI give them four stars mainly for overall atmosphere in the lounge and selection of the hookahs. They have a huge assortment of hookah flavors - at least 25 that you can mix and match, and you can also choose liquids other than water for the bottom of the hookah. My only complaints are that the hookahs take phenomenally long to come out (I can never understand why this part takes so long - the drinks and even the food arrives before the hookah!) and they won't refill coals - you just have to order a new hookah flavor. But, the music is good and the seating is comfortable, so the wait doesn't bother me enough to stop going.\n\nThe food is good, but not exceptional. It's decent middle eastern food for Las Vegas, but like I said, if it weren't for the great vibe in the hookah lounge, I wouldn't go for the food alone. The hummus, baba ganoush, and meat dolmas are my favorite appetizers, and the lamb skewers are a great entree. I wouldn't recommend going to this place for dinner, but I would hands-down recommend going to have a fun night smoking hookah and grabbing some drinks with friends."

We're not smokers, but were pleasantly surprised with the subtle aroma of the few smokers in the vicinity.  I'd characterize it as a cross between pipe tobacco and light, fruity incense.\n\nAnyways, we enjoyed a number of the half-off appetizers and cocktails.  The appetizers were great.  We had the stuffed grape leaves (filled with a well-seasoned ground beef), the pesto pita pizza with mushrooms, the falafel and the chicken fingers dipped in a phenomenal buffalo sauce.  Each one was better than expected.  The drinks were also very good and we walked out with the perfect buzz.  I'd recommend the Lychee martini for a strong, yet tasty after-work drink.  \n\nThe atmosphere was very serene and unique for the Vegas scene.  It was hard to imagine that we were in the heart of Summerlin while sitting on a wraparound couch and surrounded with dimmed, colored lighting and interesting, yet well-themed artwork.  \n\nWe were there for an hour and had a great time.

Served with the meal are vermicelli pilaf, basmati rice, a house salad, and grilled tomato and red pepper.\n\nI started my meal with a cup of their summer soup available for a limited time.  It's a cucumber yogurt cold soup with walnut pieces and golden raisins for a touch of sweetness.  The soup was topped with some croutons and garnished with a sprig of mint.  It was excellent!  Very different and very refreshing.\n\nFor the main course, the kebab trio was perfect for the two of us.  My wife does not like lamb.  By sharing the trio, I was able to have some lamb while she stuck with chicken and koobideh.  Of the three, the koobideh was the star of the dish.  The lamb was cooked too much--I had requested rare and it was more on the medium side.  It was also a bit tough.  The chicken was OK but there wasn't much spice to it.  The koobideh, on the other hand, was done medium rare as I asked and it was flavorful and very enjoyable.\n\nFor dessert, my wife got the rice pudding (it was very good), and I got an order of baklava--also very good.\n\nService was not the best.  We waited at the podium for about 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  My iced tea wasn't refilled in a timely manner and even though there were only a few other diners in the room, our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time only checking back with us once near the end of our dinner.  I also thought it was a bit tacky to take the dessert order, enter it into a nearby terminal, and then put the bill on the table before clearing the dishes and well before dessert was brought.  Bad form.\n\nIf I decide to come back, it will be for takeout, but with other choices in the area for Mediterranean food, I probably will go elsewhere."

It's a great mix of hummus, boba ganoush and fries. The salmon dish is great for a main dish. They have a good variety of flavored tobacco for the hookah to choose from."

Although decor is very nice and seemingly authentic, there is a touch of fakeness and not authenticity about it all; The waitresses are always recomending the more \"Americanized\" dishes and knew very little of the more traditional Mediterranean dishes the few times that I dined here. \n\n2. They started offering pasta! dishes!!! What travesty offering run of the mill spaghetti in a Hookah lounge and Mideterranean place, let's focus on the cuisine at hand!!!\n\n3. Kataifi, my favorite desert is gone!!!\n\nI still enjoyed my Fatoush salad and Baklava desert, and teas were certainly good, but food is still far from what it is at the Maryland location. It seems like the owners are trying to capitalize by abandoning more traditional fair and offering more \"poplar with the masses\" fair. I was not impressed and won't come to this location of Paymon's again, unless I am really pressed to find no other dining establishment (not likely)."

Our drink orders were taken (tap water for me, an ice tea, and a child's soda) and menus were presented.  When the waitress brought back the drinks I asked if we could have a full house menu, as there was only bar food.  She said that the kitchen had just closed and this was all they had.  I don't a lot of fried food, and neither does my child.  He wanted hummus and pita, so I asked if she could go into the kitchen and see if there was any hummus or baba ganoush left, figuring I could always have it on a pita as a vegetarian sandwich.  It was literally 10 after 9, and the items I was asking for were no cook.  Plus, other diners were still being served from the kitchen.  She came back and said that the chef wouldn't be able to accommodate me, and that she didn't know why.  She apologized and said that she works every Thursday night and I could come back any other time after hours and get it.  Well...If I could have it on any other Thursday night after 9 pm, why couldn't I have it on that night?  Especially when other diners were still being served food from the full menu?  \n\nWe decided not to stay, and apologized to her.  She gave us a bill for the ice tea and soft drink which came to over $6!  We paid and left.  \n\nI have always loved their food, but no matter how much I want it, I doubt I will go back."

Also the service was so-so. Therefore my review is down from 5 stars. I don't mean you should stay away, especially when you most everything you can spend money on in Las Vegas is a rip off.

My medium curry was flavored with a long hair in it. The dolma was a huge disappointment.

I TAKE IT ALL BACK!!! WOW!!!\nThe ambiance and d\u00e9cor of this place was remarkable. High ceilings, beautiful carpeting on the floors and walls. I for sure felt like I walked into the castle where Aladdin dreamed of living. \nThe hookah side was not too smoky and you could eat your food, enjoy your drink, and sit comfortably without being bothered by the other parties. I of course tried the hookah, we had watermelon margarita and it was good considering I don't smoke.\nBut the real treasure of this place. The food and drinks. Oh man. Ok so first I ordered their version of a cosmo with a sugared rim. Not bad, especially if you get it during happy hour. We had hummus, pesto pizza with red peppers, chicken masala, lamb kabobs, and salmon. \nI would order every single thing again. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the spices were not overwhelming. Same thing with the salmon. I loved that they had Greek and Italian options as well as curry, and other more authentic style Indian Cuisine. Then at the end, I tried the Bloody Mary. NO REGRETS even after being stuffed. The mix was house-made and it was spiced perfectly. My mouth literally waters for one as I type. \nI cant wait to go back, I probably wont hookah, but I will enjoy plenty of decently priced food and drinks. I hear they get crazy on the weekends, DJ and all."

I must say, as someone who has been a fan of Greek food for quite some time, it is difficult to find a falafel that is done right. You won't be disappointed with the little nuggets you get here. Crispy, crunchy, and smooth garbanzo texture. No burnt rubbery falafel in this joint! (which is refreshing to say the least). I wasn't particularly impressed with the roasted red pepper pita sandwich, a bit bland but edible nonetheless. One recommendation I do have is the veggie kabob, which features Mediterranean-style veggies grilled to perfection, especially the red pepper, yum! \n\nCame here for the first time the other day and will definitely be back to experience it night-style, hookah and all.

The food has always been consistently good.  This is also one of the better looking Mediterranean places, so it's a nice place to hang out.  They also have a pretty impressive menu.  They serve koobideh (ground beef kebab) which is my favorite thing in the world.  They also serve some Italian, and Indian dishes.  I haven't tried many of those yet, but it's nice to have options."

When you claim to feature: Greek, Italian, Persian, Middle Eastern, Indian, and vegetarian dishes...you have the potential to be master of none.  Success!  This, unfortunately, is what they've become.  I've been a few times to try different items (kebabs, pasta, other)...and final and last straw was when I sent back my plate 3 times.   I'm done with Paymon's.\n\nI've never tried their Hookah, but I've walked thru the separate room from the dining side, and it's absolutely gorgeous.  Great lighting, beautiful artwork, and well-ventilated.  For locals, it could be a great night out with the buds, or a date -- but , make sure you get this, it's not 'Vegas'.  It's nice lounge, but you can pick-it-up and place-it-down in Anytown, USA.  Parking is easy, no hassle in the private lot, no valet necessary.\n\nIn the end, Hookah wins, but the food is middle-of-the-road."

We had the baba ganush, falafel, she had the steak kebabs and I had the koobideh. The baba ganush was a bit bland but ok. The falafel was mediocre - over fried/too crispy for my taste. My cousin ordered a roasted tomato on the side. It was barely roasted and cold when it arrived. Our dinner platters honestly were the only thing that we were fully satisfied with. Our hostess wasnt terrible but she wasnt great either. We asked for to go boxes and she brought the boxes with the check and left, leaving us to do it ourselves. Okay no biggie. To leave an honest review Id have to give them 3 1/2 stars for the overall food and service. Regardless we didnt complain and we did leave a decent tip. We spent $65 between the 2 of us and to pay that much I would have expected to have a better experience. I remember their food and service being a lot better when they first opened up but that was many years ago. Seems to have downgraded a bit since then."

Cant remember which night it is also, but one of the nights, there is a all you can eat pasta dish evening-different types of pastas and sauce. Will have to try that sometime.

And by that, I mean everything looked and tasted as if it was prepared hours ago and had been sitting in a kitchen waiting for the rush to come in.  Possibly reheated. I dont know, but every dish I ordered reminded of  the cheap quality dishes you find at food chains like Sizzler or Applebees. Seriously, I love paymons for their hookah lounge but the quality of their dinner food was very very very disappointing. Stick to the hookah, get food somewhere else."

However tonight is a different story...\n\n12/16/2015 @ 6:30pm\nWe arrived and went to the hookah lounge attached to the restaurant, it was busy as normal for a week night not overly packed we sat down and the waitress came and took our order, she even knew we came here regularly and commented about it. We ordered two waters and a lemon drop hookah - not a complex order by any means but the hookah lasted for 33 minutes 7:03pm I looked at my phone as the waitress never came back around to check our hookah, waters, if we wanted anything else not to even see if things were okay. So let the waiting game begin ... 10 mins turned to 20 ... Which turned into 30 while waiting and having the waitress walk pass numerous times, but her attention was to the gentlemen (whom I believe was the manager off duty - I've seen this man here almost every time we are there and I'm sure that's not by pure coincidence) and his friend to our left, but never rendered service to us until 7:38pm to while I told her I wanted her to fix the hookah but I'll just have the check as the service was horrible. I made sure I paid with my credit card so I would be able to dispute the charge as service was never rendered.

The hostess seated us right away and a friendly waiter got us our drinks. \nStarted with a Magic Carpet, my stepmom got a vanilla type of martini. Martini was kind of gross, but mine was delish (redbull, vodka, and chambord. Simple enough.) We had the combination as an appetizer, comes with falaffel, tabouli, baba ganoush, hummus, and bouranni and stuffed grape leaves which I always avoid at all costs. My homemade tabouli is much tastier, but the rest was very very good. This was all new to my Dad and he was impressed. Dad got chicken fesenjan, which he swore was amazing, as a vegetarian I refused to taste it, so all I can say is my Dad is a total meat and potatoes guy, and he was about to lick that damn plate. Hubby had meatball sandwich, not really sure why they serve Italian here! I got the eggplant panini and was not impressed, a bit bland, just a plain mushy sandwich. But the FRIES... omg YUM they really are great!! We finished up with some tirimasu, heavy on the rum, just the way we like it, and some sort of dessert martini which they added dark chocolate to at my request. All of the food was good, not super amazing, and I should have avoided the Italian and enjoyed Meditteranean. I would go back, great atmosphere! We had my kids and sadly could not enjoy the hookah, but the lounge smelled divine when we passed by it!"

She'd discovered this place when she had a project in LV and I was happy to go along as I love Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nA little ways off the strip, this gem can be found in an unassuming strip mall. The restaurant itself is quite large and it looks like from the doors that they have expanded into adjacent storefronts a few times. I can see why :)\n\nWhen we arrived for a late lunch, we were quickly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was great--checked in with us regularly and helped us figure out how much to order without over ordering. \n\nWe decided to split a plate because he advised us it was large--it was! The chicken kabob skewer has 10 ounces of meat on it! We also split a side of dips--the babaghanouj and the yogurt dip. The baba was probably the best I've ever had! It comes with a side of white or whole wheat pita. When we ran out, we were offered more pita or sliced veggies (super healthy--love it!)\n\nThe chicken kabob plate was perfect for two fit friends to split. With 10 ounces of grilled chicken, we each got ample protein. It also came with a greek salad, roasted red peppers and a great rice dish. We finished most, but not all of the plate--that's how large it was.\n\nSince we were visiting and didn't have a car, we asked our waiter to call a cab and he quickly obliged. When one didn't show up, he checked in, found out the cab company was in the middle of a shift change, and took the initiative to call a second cab company so that we wouldn't have a much more prolonged wait. \n\nIf I lived locally, this would definitely be a place I'd come regularly. Tasty food, good portions and great service--winner in my book!"

Well she knows her mom loves international food so we headed to Paymon. We shared a lamb kabob dinner since we are both light eaters. She loved it. She loved the \"cinnamon rice\" as she called it AND the greek salad, AND the saganaki (sp).  Now she says when she goes home she's going to try thebplace there and hopes it will be just as tasty."

My friend ordered a gyro but when the order came out it was a chicken gyro. When she pointed out the mistake the waiter took it back with apologies.  Totally forgiveable. But a moment later you could loudly here the kitchen staff arguing with the waiter about the mistake.  The waiter then very quickly returned with the correct order.  The service was very good untill the end of the meal when I  wanted the check.  The waiter was nowhere to be found. I had to ask the bus boy for the check witch the host brought to the table.  I was a very disappointing experience after all the great things I have heard.  I'm hoping it was just a bad day. I will give this place one more shot but it may  be a while before I return."

The place was not busy, and the hostess greeted us right away. Fine. But she takes us to a table literally steps from the front door, directly in line with the kitchen door. Can you say freeway? Could have asked for another table, but I didn't...so my bad, but I don't think I should have had to...\n\nServer came and took orders promptly, ok so far. Hummus appetizer comes out quickly, always delicious. Then the entrees came out, gyros salad for me, falamus pita for my wife. also delicious. Maybe not exactly authentic Mediterranean food, but yummy nonetheless. Shared a few Athens fries...these are the bomb.\n\nSo what's the problem? Indifferent service.  Our server did not once stop and ask how we were doing. After he took our order, he literally disappeared. A different server brought the food out, and of course our server didn't bother to check if we got everything we needed. He must have passed our table 10 times without so much as a nod of the head. I even had to flag him down for a water refill! \n\nWe finished eating and just sat there. No offer of dessert, nothing.  I flagged him down for the check, since by that time I was getting annoyed and just wanted to split. \n\nWe like Paymon's and will probably go back, but if the service is as poor  next time, we'll move on."

They are definitely special.\n\nI had hot green tea with honey and it was delicious :] served in a pot.\n\nAside from Athen's fries we had calamari for an appetizer which was the fried variety-just how I like! And a big serving for the price of about $10.\n\nI had the Greek Pie.. I forgot the name but the menu read that it had a baked b\u00e9chamel sauce on top.\n\nOverall it was forgettable. It was served with a side of veggies. Pretty much tasted like a soup.\n\nSomeone got the meat kabob gyro which was said to be very good.\n\nAnd for dessert we shared an unimpressive baklava.\n\nHad take out a couple of weeks later from here and had the chicken Marsala and also had a bite of chicken parmasen.\n\nHelped keep my rating to a 3.\n\nOur server was great but it ends with the food which was meh. \n\nBig complaint is the small tables.

            "review": "Just driving around, looking for something different to eat. Saw the sign and wandered in. Paymon's could best be described as a middle-Eastern-fusion place, no that doesn't quite describe it. First of all the interior is breathtakingly beautiful; and the ambience is matched by the food. They have Greek, Italian, Indian, and Persian dishes (in alphabetical order), and sandwiches, all very reasonably priced. We started with a combination of dips and pita bread: hummus and yogurt-cucumber (actually tzatziki but who can pronounce that?). Next was the lentil soup with melted feta cheese. One of us had Tandoori chicken and the other had chicken curry, both out of this world.\n\nNow an aside. There were two Las Vegas Metro Police officers seated adjacent to us, and that day was the day they buried one of two officers who, a week earlier, had both been shot in the head and killed while dining in a restaurant. Now the Las Vegas cops are awesome for what they do every day, but I can't imagine how it must feel to sit down for a restaurant meal, after that incident, not knowing if there's some other nutcase who's going to walk through the door and open fire on you. Of course, the fact that cops eat at Paymon's is a recommendation in itself.\n\nI can't wait to get back to Paymon's and check out the rest of the menu, or maybe I'll order the Tandoori chicken the next dozen times. You really owe it to yourself to try this place, it's every bit as good as those fancy Las Vegas Strip hotel restaurants that bear the names of famous chefs who never visit.\n\nHookah lounge, sealed off from the restaurant (untried). Open 11 AM-1 AM every day, take-out until 8 PM. Cocktails. Credit cards."

The kabob was a huge serving that my wife and  split and couldn't finish. The quality of the meat was good and correctly cooked to the requested temp. It didn't come with Basmati rice, but did have rice pilaf with a wonderful butteriness to it.\n\nTheir menu is ridiculously large with cuisines including Italian, Mediterranean, Persian, Greek, and Indian. In my opinion they'd be better off with a more focused menu, but I guess they have to do what they can to attract the most customers. They even have a kid's menu with all the typical kid stuff. \n\nService was decent and prices were ok. The interior looks a little dated but it was comfortable enough."

The interior of Paymon's is well decorated and cozy, but it's not at all a snooty atmosphere and casual wear is perfectly fine (that said, I will say that I felt underdressed whilst wearing my hiking clothes and desperately needing a shower post-hike).\n\nThe prices are a little on the higher side, although apparently there is an all-you-can-eat pasta special for only $9 (it seems like a good deal to me, but I'm not a big pasta fan so I didn't order it).  A simple vegetarian pita sandwich with no sides runs on the order of ~$8-9. I had the Eggplant pita, and it was overall very good.  The ingredients (grilled eggplant and roasted red peppers) tasted very fresh and the pesto sauce had good flavor.  It wasn't the most overwhelming sandwich I've ever had, but I would be inclined to order it again.\n\nThe thing that stood out the most in my experience was the flaming saganaki (greek cheese).  That was FANTASTIC!  I am a fairly picky cheese eater, and was extremely happy when I tried this.  The texture was excellent with a crispy outside and gooey inside, and the cheese itself had a very elegant flavor. \n\nI will definitely be going back to Paymon's in the future, and am excited to try some of their other dishes!"

I usually get one of the kabob platters. The meat is high quality and the portions are very large, I usually end up taking about half home.

Just fine with me, I came in for a salad anyway.\n\nThe wait for the food was short, and it was packaged nicely when I got home. I ordered the Greek salad which came with romaine, red onion, pepperoncini, feta, tomatoes and olives. The olives were quality with the pits still in them, and the pepperoncini were served whole in the salad. The tomatoes you could tell had been refrigerated for a while as they had no taste except to be slightly sour with a mealy texture. The feta was dry and grated which was very strange to me. I prefer a creamier, softer feta, the kind that comes packed in water. I usually associate dry feta with poor quality. The vinaigrette was thin, thank goodness as I hate syrupy dressings, but I still added some red wine vinegar to my salad at home because it lacked the acidity I was looking for.\nI also got a side of rice, and it came with white basmati rice topped with some saffron basmati rice. It was decent, but tasted heavily of butter. I can only imagine how much they probably used when steaming/reheating it.\n\nThe ambiance here was very pretty and I can see this easily being a nice late night lounge for locals who live nearby.

Everything is amazingly overpriced.\n\nGreg had the pastitsio, which is basically bland Greek lasagna, something that I could never get excited about.  (Apparently, this is no longer on the menu).  I had the falafel which had really large patties.  I prefer my patties smaller and crispier.  The fries were just superb though.  I could go to Paymon's for just the fries with their strange mustard like fry sauce.\n\nThe thing that pissed me off though is when we ordered a pot of tea.  They have a great selection of tea to order from, but when we asked if we could split a pot of overpriced tea, we were informed that it wasn't allowed.  Really?  Everyone has to get their own POT of tea...not a glass, a pot.  You can't split a pot of tea.  What a joke of a restaurant showing that they really just care about ways to make money!\n\nPaymon's, by the way, is the restaurant that gets called in about on KNPR constantly.  Whenever they have a food critic on, people call in and rave about Paymon's.  It got the point that people at KNPR usually mention that they will not be taking calls about Paymon's and that Paymon's is just all right of a restaurant.  The people that called in about Paymon's apparently were over-enthusiastic employees."

And then tonight one of of us long time customers were thrown out because we were wearing a tank top. The waitress, after serving us food and drink, decided to remind us that one of us was wearing a tank top and it wasn't acceptable. They told us to leave and that the food would be their treat. How fucking generous!!!!!  I've been going to Paymons for years now and was astonished that were asked to leave in the middle of our meal.  After all of the money I've spent time after time at Paymons I was shocked To be asked to leave!!! Literally in the middle of our meal they said we had to leave due to our dress code. Mind you they weren't even sold out!!! What a solid disappointment!!!!!!!!"

Yay for originality!\n\nI like that there is a bit of flexibility in their dishes. I can have pasta, or curry or gyros. So there isn't a big fuss if a group of us want to eat there and all have different tastes. My usual for quite awhile was the broiled steak kabob. The meat is always very tasty (but not always the most tender) and the basmati rice fluffy and nicely spiced. The vegetables are always overcooked. Not that I'm a bit fan of them anyway but I might be more enticed to eat them if this was not the case.\n\nMy current favorite is the chicken curry. I get it about medium spicy but then I cover it in their racy red sauce. I could pour that on just about everything it's so good. The hummus is my  mom's favorite dish. I like it too but it is so filling that I usually can't finish my entree if we get it as an appetizer. The gyros are nice, the meat is not dry and they are really smashing with a side of Athens fries. The sauce that comes with the fries is pretty addictive."

Served with delicious Tzatziki sauce.\n\nATHENS FRIES\nAs it says on the menu, these fries are highly addictive and indeed they are! Addiction derives from their house seasoned fries accompanied by a delicious creamy dipping. Nevertheless, I like to dip mine with their special bottled hot sauce.\n\nHUMMUS\nOne of my favorite delectable dip! Puree of chickpeas, Tahini, fresh garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon juice. \n\nBABA GANOSH\nThe name speaks for it self, it sounds like a hot Greek man riding on a white horse down the white sands of Greece....but it is a scrumptious mixture of seasoned, baked eggplant, blended with Tahini, fresh garlic, Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.\n\nTABULI SALAD\nWhat a fresh Mediterranean classic of a salad! Tabuli salad is combined with chopped parsley, bulgur wheat, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and fresh mint leaves. Tossed with their house seasonings, extra virgin Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  I know I know...it has gluten in it, but it's already hard to be gluten free so I ate it anyway! This salad is delicious!!\n\nEGGPLANT PARMESAN\nThis Fresh Eggplant coated with Italian bread crumbs, layered with roasted whole garlic, Marinara sauce and topped with Mozzarella cheese was sooooo gooood!!!  It even came with Barilla penne pasta Marinara which made the dish so huge and plenty of left overs.\n\nI heart Paymon's!!"

Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was because we arrived toward the end of happy hour, but regardless, it just was okay at best.\n\nI met my friend at the hookah bar, where we were quickly set up with the Disco Lemonade hookah and ordered drinks.  The drinks (apple martini for my friend, lychee martini for myself), were actually quite good, as was the hookah, which was mild and flavorful.  That's where the good stuff ends, though.\n\nService from that point was a slow and lacking. We ordered 3 dishes: the wings, calamari, and the Athens fries, which took quite awhile to come out, were lukewarm at best, and tasted old- as if they had been sitting out for awhile.  The hookah attendant seemed annoyed that we weren't smoking our hookah fast enough and *gasp* socializing and talking to each other.  When we finished our meal, we asked our waitress for boxes for the leftovers, which she never brought.  No one ever came back to ask if we were done, needed anything else- or even to bring our check.  After waiting for at least 20 minutes, we finally tracked down our waitress at the bar to ask for the boxes and the bill.  The boxes were given to us with annoyance, and after seeing us struggle with them, a bag wasn't offered- luckily, the hostess at the front offered one to us.\n\nI am not sure if I'll give it another chance.

It's been too many months since I've burned the roof of my mouth while trying to eat Saganaki and Athens Fries.\n\nHOOKAH LOUNGE & SERVICE\nMy cousin and her friend invited me here for a round of hookah the other night. We weren't sure if we were supposed to enter the lounge or wait at the front of the restaurant to be directed, but we had to wait quite a bit for someone to show up and help us -- by the way, there was hardly anyone dining in the restaurant at 8:00PM. When the hostess finally appeared, she directed us to the lounge where we waited AGAIN. Finally, we were told we could sit at a corner booth and that our hookah waitress (?) would arrive shortly.\n\nWe were given a tray containing an array of tobacco flavors to choose from, as well as a menu. The choices on the menu are pricier because some are specialty tobaccos infused with alcohol. For $15 you can mix different flavored tobaccos from the given tray and puff on hookah for more than an hour.  My cousin and I chose to mix margarita, peach, and strawberry which is an awesome, fruity blend. \n\nYou can also eat and drink in the hookah lounge. My cousin's friend ordered a couple bottles of Fat Tire beers for himself, while my cousin and I ordered a flavorful Moroccan tea. The plastic containers of honey that our waitress gave us were unnecessary because the tea was already naturally sweetened. \n\nOur waitresses were nice, but they didn't stop by our table as much to see how we were doing, so we often had to play the waiting game.\n\nOVERALL\nReally, I'd rate this a 3.5 than a 4.0, because the service could be better. I'm not sure if $15 is a reasonable price for a round of hookah, but I can say the experience was fun and a unique way to hang out with friends and unwind from a stressful day."

I was initially going to give this place no more than 2 stars, however the one thing I loved about this place is the decor. It's unlike any I've seen in the US, and I have been to plenty of Persian and middle eastern restaurants as well as hookah cafes. The ambiance and decor in the hookah lounge is absolutely stunning, however the hookah and the food are not. \n\nWe ordered the koobideh jabab and gyro sandwich and both came out dry and way too spicy. The spices used in the koobideh tasted like Indian spices and any Persian that has had real koobideh knows it should not taste like that at all. The meat wasn't cooked all that great and the rice wasn't cooked properly either. \n\nI was very disappointed with the food, however the service was great- the young lady that helped us was very sweet and again the decor was beautiful. \n\nIf you want a nice place for a drink and mediocre hookah, I guess it's worth the shot- as for good Persian food and good hookah, i will have to pass on this next time."

I asked for lemons and had to wait for 10 minutes to remind the server. When our entrees came we had 2 steak skewer plates one medium well and med rare. My side salad was warm as they probably left it under the warmer while they waited for the meat to cook. My husbands meat was beyond rare not even close to med rare. He always orders a side of the veggies and the veggies were soggy and watered down. To top things off we could see one of the cooks eating while he was cooking. Major health violation and made me lose my appetite."

I absolutely adore this place. From the minute we stepped into the hookah lounge we were welcomed and felt at home. If you want to spend a couple of hours chillin' in an exotic atmosphere eating Mediterranean food--we're talking here fried calamari and baba gnoush served with a huge side of soft pita bread--while sipping any specialty drinks. . . ours were a variation of the margarita, at happy hour half price--this is your place.  And, hey maybe add a hookah to the mix.\n\nThe lounge is dark, sultry and cozy. The d\u00e9cor is \"Persian Sultan den\" with walls and ceiling a deep warm maroon.  A selection of large paintings of women in suggestive poses from past centuries sit in ornately carved frames vying for space with heavily-patterned cloth tapestries which gives the room a tent-like atmosphere. There are plenty of pillows to lounge upon. My wife said, \"we need to create a hookah den in our house.\" I said, \"sure, I'm in.\" At first I was curious why the music wasn't traditional Middle Eastern, but I soon warmed up to the House music, which surprisingly suited the space.\n\nThe server/bartenders had no attitude whatsoever and made me want to spend a long time here. The hookah master gently asked us if we would like to try a hookah. He said he would mix a special novice blend for us. We wondered if his watermelon/grape recommendation would be too fruity, but the concoction had a smooth taste and aroma and I felt myself relaxing with every puff. The crystal ball says there is a heartier mix for me to try next time."

You will get seated next to the kitchen doors so you get ran down by the wait staff every time they bring out food plus you get a birds eye view of how filthy and noisy the kitchen really is. You may also get to see the dishwashers ass hanging out of his pants while he scraps food off the plates and into the garbage bin, but like I said, after years of dinning out alone I expect this kind of shitty service. Tonight though took on a whole new level of shitty service and I am going to name names so just in case you are a woman and you decide to dine at this restaurant you may want to think twice. The place is Paymon's off Sahara. The experience was so bad that I have no idea what their food taste like because the waitress sucked so bad that I didn't have any appetite left after 15 min. of her attitude and I got up and left. \nIf you are a server do not assume a single woman is going to tip you badly especially a woman my age and in the manner that I dress and carry myself. I was a waitress for years and I know how hard the job is but that is no excuse to be rude and obnoxious to a customer. Two thumbs down for Paymon's"

We had such a great meal and experience here last year that we selected it for our December gathering. I arrived after two of my friends, who had been seated. He ordered the drink special but was told that they were out of the ingredients for that drink. Ran out THAT MORNING. I ordered my fave from last time, the Mangorita....it sucked. Poorly made and nothing like the fine concoction of our last visit. \n\nThe rest of the guests arrived and they ordered a scotch neat and a glass of wine. 20 minutes later it was still not there. In the interim, they had taken our dinner order. As the waiter is being addressed about the missing drinks...hardly difficult to prepare...we are informed that they are out of meat balls. An Italian menu that is out of meat balls because....wait for it....THEY FORGOT TO MAKE THEM!!! \n\nWe got our meals finally and it was just a disaster after all of that rigmarole. Now the manager comes to speak to one of our group and says he will comp a round of drinks off the bill....well, they defer to the FIRST round ordered which was the first two who arrived, so no, they did NOT comp a ROUND of drinks for the group. Clearly this place has encountered some kind of change. I fully expect it to be featured on Restaurant Rescue it has gotten so bad. They get one star becuse the calimare was great...the rest rated about 100 on teh suck-o-meter."

It's a 3 out of 10. \n\nThe lounge service is the WORST of the WORST in Las Vegas - the worst.

I probably ate the majority of it, but I LOVE hummus. \n\nBy the time our lunch came out I was pretty full on hummus. I had ordered the Chicken Pita Wrap and the husband ordered Gyro Pita Wrap with a side of athens fries. My chicken was really dry and it wasn't very tasty....a big disappointment. However, my husband's Gyro wrap was very tasty and not dry. The athens fries were good, but not blow me out of this world. \n\nOverall, for a 30 dollar lunch, was it worth it? Nope, but I can see why people come here with their late hours and hookah."

The fries completely make this a late night snack place for me though.\nLast time I had the unlimited pasta and that was great value - BTW there is nothing wrong with having a side of their Athens fries as an appetizer before pasta!"

Same goes with the fries. The salad was ok but very cumbersome to eat - the gyros meat was also stone cold.\n\nOverall, this was an okay experience - nothing too bad, but not so great either."

The food is good, and the menu is big; it even includes Italian pasta entrees. While I have never had anything sub-par, their falafels are not impressive. The salads are large. (Even a small Greek salad can be shared.) My favorite thing to eat there is the lentil soup. My biggest complaint is that the food is overpriced. However, they are open late, and they have a pretty extensive hot tea menu. All of this balances out to a solid A-OK 3-stars and a rather boring review on my part."

            "review": "Hmm...So I guess peer pressure really does work. I never thought I'd be praising a hookah lounge, let alone just trying the stuff, and now here I am!\n \nPaymon's has two locations: one by UNLV and the other in the Northwest part of town (the Sahara location definitely has less criminal activity and is therefore my favorite one). Surprisingly, it's actually pretty classy inside and I didn't expect it to be as nice as it is. Upon walking in, I was pleased to see that both locations are beautifully decorated in a Moroccan style with gorgeous pillows and dimly lit lanterns that make me feel like I'm in Aladdin. Come here to hang out with friends, unwind after work, have a few drinks and just relax.  Even the food is pretty tasty. Mostly locals frequent Paymon's, so it's safe to say that the chances of a tour bus packed full of foreigners unloading there are slim.\n \nThe hookah flavors choices are wide but my favorite by far is green apple.  It's amazing how real it tastes!  AND its calorie free. If you're hungry for real food, don't miss the Athens fries, which are awesome and an order of hummus and pita bread."

My buddy found a 1 inch piece of steel wire brush, the type you would use for pots and pans in his gyro.  We brought it to the attention of the server.  Without expecting anything free, the gyro should have been comped and at least an apology.  Nothing.\n\nFollowed up with a complaint to their corporate office.  Manager finally apologized with the excuse that our server was a nice guy but not very intelligent.  Next time we could receive a comp dinner for 2.  That's not the point.  Health Code violation and someone potentially getting injured from eating a gyro is the point."

One person can easily have lunch their for under $15 and leave being extremely stuffed. However, I would not recommend this place if you were looking for legit mediterranean (Italian/Greek) cuisine, since items at this restaurant are fairly Americanized. Likewise, it is probably because many of the dishes are already so westernized that majority of the customers would enjoy their flavours (some people don't like actual greek flavours). Overall, if you're looking for something legitimately Mediterranean, this might not be the restaurant for you, but if you want something INSPIRED by Mediterranean cooking, I think this would be an excellent place to try out.\n\nI would love to return to this place if I ever return to Vegas!\n\nPS. Order small, b/c things come in big portions. When I went I didn't have enough room to try desert even though I wanted to :( ."

For starters when we walked in most of the little sectionals were already taken but the waitress kindly made some room for me and my girlfriend to chill. Once we were seated we were recommended some sort of hookah flavor. I'm not much of a hookah smoker but I'll do it socially. The flavor we had was good however the hookah they brought us barely worked! We had to ask for assistance at least 3-4 times and the burner was messed up. Bummer.. Took a while to flag down the waitress although she was sweet something was still lacking... On to the drips they have they lyche martini that's great and another drink that's similar to a Long Island! Both good! The recommended gyro came out the first time on some stale bread that I had sent back because there was no explanation as to why when I picked up my sandwich to bite the whole thing crumbled.. Literally at this point I was beyond over the experience.. I can see the poets rial and if I'm being treated I may return..."
