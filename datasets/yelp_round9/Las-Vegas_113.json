They served us this things that were like mini breadsticks that were so mouthwatering I can't even describe them. I was also impressed with them bringing out a Happy Birthday plate to my guy. \nWe did make plenty of comments though about the 20 year old chicks with the 70 year old dudes. There were plenty of them."

It's the kind of music that makes you feel tense, upset, annoyed.\nOur waiter agreed with us but there was nothing he could do.  \nSo, Nove Italiano mixes bad taste of Las Vegas with the excellence of their chefs, and wait staff."

There is not a bad table in the place and they can accomadate almost any request. Always make a reservation but they should be able to get you in either way.

            "review": "I was recently in Vegas with a group of 9 girlfriends. We wanted to do a night checking out the Palms so we decided to start the night with dinner at Nove. The place is a beautiful layout on the 51st floor with views of the strip everywhere you look.  The food was so- so for the price. I will say it was a nice to have the option of getting half portions of the pasta and the resaturant also gave a complimentary tuna tartar which was a nice gesture. Everyone in the party had luke-warm feelings about the food- just wasn't overwelmed. The service was great though, especially when I asked them to bring out a dessert for my friend to celebrate her graduation- they brought out a nice plate of cookies for the table to share at no extra cost.\n\nWith all of the other restaurants in Vegas I don't know that I'd return there for dinner- food wasn't horrible but wasn't spectacular either. The atmosphere was great though."

            "review": "A very uneven experience.  Some highs and some lows.  The first high is the private elevator you take to get up to this place which has a great view of Las Vegas.  We had a great waiter who was very enthusiastic about his recommendations and generally was very helpful though at times he was nowhere to be found.  There's a serious cocktail and wine program we started the meal with some good cocktails.\n\nWe had several appetizers, some of which were very, very good.  The shrimp francaise is billed on the menu as the best shrimp franchise you've ever eaten.  Since I've never had shrimp francaise, I would have to say that they were correct.  Seriously though, it was very, very good.  These were huge shrimp coated in egg-batter (francaise-style) and served with a creamy lemon sauce.  Simply divine.  The other appetizers were generally good but not to the rarified level of the shrimp.  The bruschetta, grilled octopus, fried calamari and prosciutto with burrata were all fine but not memorable.\n\nMy pasta starter was the gnocchi with parmesan cream and crispy pancetta.  This was delicious.  The gnocchi were perfectly chewy and the sauce was agreeably salty, smoky and funky.  Excellent.  The panzanella salad was not really a panzanella - typically a panzanella salad highlights grilled or toasted bread which soak up a dressing enhanced with the juices of fresh tomatoes.  This salad was a green salad with a few croutons.  It's false advertising.\n\nOur entrees fell short of the mark.  I had the veal chop milanese - this was a special of the night.  This was a bone-in veal chop that is pounded very thin, breaded in breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese, and fried.  It is an impressive piece of meat, pounded so thin so as to be larger than the large serving platter it was served on, but taste-wise it was just a deep fried piece of meat.  No capers, no sauce, nothing greens.  It was really a weak dish and I regretted getting it immensely.  The baked penne entree was more worthy of Stouffer's than an upscale Las Vegas restaurant.  Shameful, actually.  The filet mignon was properly prepared but the aged balsamico that accompanied it seemed too sour and made the dish very unbalanced.\n\nAfter the debacle of the entrees, we did not stay for dessert.  Alas, other than the best shrimp francaise I've ever eaten and a few tasty gnocchi, this was a disappointing experience."

            "review": "Ate at Nove tonight as a special treat from my wife. The view is amazing and the decor tasteful. The food was excellent. The bread sticks were the best tasting I've ever had. We had the calamari appetizer which was fantastic. Lightly breaded and with exactly the right amount of garlic and lemon. The chef also prepared a special crostini one with salmon and the other with tuna I thought the tuna was the best, it had a balsalmic reduction that added a bit of sweetness. For my main entree I had the Nove spaghetti that had king crab, calamari, shrimp and scallops in a tomato sauce. The seafood was cooked perfectly.  We didn't save room for dessert unfortunately. There were so many amazing dishes on the menu that I'd definitely go back for a special occasion. And the restaurant having a door into the Playboy club has a positive effect on the eye candy as the youthful clientele is definitely fun to watch in those short skirts."

            "review": "This place TOTALLY delivered for a bachelorette party this weekend.\n\nIs it expensive?  Yes.  But, the pre-fixe menu was almost too much food for everyone, and the food was delicious.  The bachelorette totally loved the little personalized menus and the waiter was on top of everything.  The bachelorette party package with the entry to the clubs was worth the money.\n\nThe drinks were VERY expensive ($16 for a mojito), and so we only got 1.  Had they been cheaper we would probably have indulged in at least 2, so that's something to think about.  \n\nThe view was part of the charm, and the ambience, with all the other parties going on and people dancing in their seats to the DJ, just made it a fun night.  \n\nThat being said, this is probably not someplace i'd take my grandmother.  It is loud and dark and she would not appreciate the atmosphere.  But, for a bachelorette party, this place struck the perfect note."

            "review": "Nove was a fantastic dining experience with good food.  Nothing special, but big portions of well prepared food.  My steak which they marinate in olive oil for a few days was nice, but not as full flavored as I would have liked.  The pastas were also good, but left something to be desired.  Our server was great, a real actor/showman playing our table like the puppets we were.  Because we were a group of ten celebrating a birthday, they brought out extra sides and deserts for us.  Definitely no shortage of food, we had a major celebrity sighting (Howard Stern) and a upbeat vibe.  I totally enjoyed my Nove experience, but with all the amazing dining options available in Vegas, I doubt I ever return."

The new operators just are not the Maloofs. Walking into bar the TVs are off.   No attention to detail whatsoever.  Guy tells me new cable operator only has two channels now.   I live here.

            "review": "The food here was good, but to be honest, I expected more. After drinking yardlongs all day (it was spring break, don't judge!) I didn't have a huge appetite so I just ordered two small plates instead of an entree. I started with the crudo--a fresh selection of sashimi, generously cut, with lemon and olive oil. Simple, it made a good beginning for the meal. I then had the raviolo, which combined a couple of my favorite ingredients: raw egg yolk, pancetta, and truffles. Sadly, it fell flat of my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I really couldn't taste the truffles at all. A little bit of a tragedy. It was also a tad oversalted and the slightest bit undercooked (and I always prefer my pasta very al dente, so this is a rare criticism from me).\n\nI might give Nove Italiano four stars based solely on the food. Unfortunately, the ambiance and the service left a lot to be desired here. With the intimate space and the amazing view, there's so much potential here...but some genius thought that a pleasant accompaniment to a romantic evening at an upscale italian restaurant would be club music pumping through the speakers. Alright, I'll probably be heading up to Moon later, but I'm not trying to get my dance on while I chew my pasta. I'm not saying i need a violin serenading me at the table, but perhaps something a little more lowkey would be more appropriate.\n\nI also felt that our waiter, while not unpleasant, didn't seem to have any grasp of the menu whatsoever. And at a restaurant where I'm likely paying $60+ for my meal? You should probably get more than 1/3 of the fishes in the crudo correct (\"white tuna\" and \"tuna\" are hardly interchangeable). You should probably know that the appropriate response when I ask if you would recommend the raviolo is not, \"It's basically bacon and eggs.\" You should probably, at the very least, be able to give a rough estimate of the portion sizes. Our waiter couldn't handle any of this. Maybe he was new, or having a bad day, or there was some other explanation for his ill-preparedness. It still rubbed me the total wrong way. I would consider coming back here again for the food, but if I don't, I don't think I'll be too upset."

At the top of the playboy tower, great view if the strip.\nRegarding the service, our server was OK, didn't really make us feel that good and welcome there (not that he did anything wrong, or maybe he just realized we don't eat meet - even though we ordered tons of other stuff.)\nThe food - well, here ill have to divide it to before desserts and after desserts. We first got the beet salad appetizer and the egg yolk ravioli. Both were great. Then we got the pesto Ravioli with the tomato sauce, it was just ok. We got a side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms which were just eh.\nAnd then we got to the desserts part... We got the cheesecake which was AWESOME, they accidentally brought us the chocolate ganache which was debatable, but the cannoli! Omg! It's a must ;)\nSo overall we've had a good experience, except the service and our main course.\nIt is pretty pricey though, everything above plus two whiskies - 125$..."

When we first got there, they had us wait at the bar for quite some time before seating us.  We thought, oh sure, they're treating the deal people as sub par.  Turns out, not so.  When we asked about it, the manager told us he would get us seated in just a moment.  The bartender came over and said the manager bought us a round of drinks because of our wait.  That was very nice of them to make up for the wait.  \n\nAnd then the manager walked us over to our table, which was truly one of the best tables in the whole restaurant.  We were right in front of the window, a spectacular view.    And later they even brought us another appetizer on the house.  \n\nThe food was amazing.  My husband and I cannot stop talking about the Mushroom Risotto.  And the passion fruit mojito was so good.  The wait staff was incredibly attentive and conversational.  \n\nKudos to them for really stepping up the customer service and making sure we were happy.  They did it right.  We will absolutely be going back next time we're in Vegas."

The room was pretty cool, but unfortunately the waiter was a bit out there and not very attentive. That said, the food on our pre-planned menu was mediocre. We had some meat and cheese plates,.then pasta dishes, and then steaks. It was far too much food for us, especially since we were heading upstairs to Moon right afterwords, and unfortunately none of it was that good. The steak, a ribeye, which I ordered medium to medium well, came out rare with cheese on top. Parmesan I think. Interesting, but really doesn't say much for your meat if you're seasoning it with cheese. The pasta dishes were also average. \n\nTotal bill per person: $165 with about two cocktails per person. Not worth it imo."

The restaurant was only 20% full and was still not even close to being full by the time dinner was over.  I had thought this was supposed to be a hipster place, but the music playing was by The Supremes and never got anywhere past the 70s...and not in a cool/retro sort of way.\nFor dinner, the server talked up a tasting menu they were just starting.  It offered the first course served family-style with 3 offerings, then a choice of entrees and then cheesecake.  The selling point was the all-you-can-drink wine.  This sure helped everyone at the table enjoy their meal more, and I was impressed that the wine pairings were quite good.  However, the food was so very average.\nI have had many better Italian meals in this town and can't find any reason to recommend it."

Nove offers up an interesting concept of pairing buffet with a celebratory, club-like atmosphere, a DJ pumping tunes you probably heard the night before, cute waitresses & dancers in sexy outfits and call it their \"High Society Day Club\". \n\nOn Sunday drag yourself out of bed to the 51st floor of the Palms Hotel. From 1pm-4pm and for $30, help yourself to a fantastic spread of Italian brunch treats from frittatas, charcuterie, cold seafood with fantastic cocktail sauce, hot breakfast items, paninis, flat bread pizza, pastas, summer salads, ceviche, and delectable dessert bites, while trying to re energize from the previous night's debauchery. The food is extremely fresh and changed quite often to ensure nothing is sitting out for too long. \n\nCocktail prices ($15) are typical of those along the Strip but these are not the water downed cocktails you ordered at the club the night before. Each one intriguing in its own way, creatively executed yet potent to provide you with a refreshing tonic to continue your party streak. \n\nNow if only this concept were brought over to New York.. perhaps our city can recapture its crown for being the \"City That Never Sleeps\". It's no wonder Las Vegas owns the title especially when offering places like Nove to keep the party going.\n\n****************\n\n- Automatic gratuity of 20% added to your party regardless of size\n- No smoking inside but they will allow you to head downstairs to the casino to have your fix."

Immediately we felt at home when greeted with a warm,friendly smile from our hostess. We were promptly sat and got  a majestic view in front of a fireplace overlooking the strip, we were told our server would be right over. We were then greeted by our server, he introduced himself and the other server working with him, his name was bill and I believe his partners name was whizzy? Right off the bat bill asked if we were here celebrating which I thought was great. His descriptions of the food made our mouths water....we wanted one of everything! The food ,atmosphere, and service was phenomenal. We were even checked on by the executive chef, the sommelier , and the manager(the sommelier and manager were both stunning, wish I were single). To top off our great meal bill got us access to the night life, what a pro!  I can't wait to go back . I will be sending all my friends and family to nove. I highly recommend it for all occasions."

It's fancy-ish, but not super fancy. Jeans are acceptable. The service is wonderful. Very attentive. There's a bar area where you sit and grab small bites (they have a separate bar menu) or order off the regular menu. They have a great penne vodka. I also like their calamari. All in all, if you're at the Palms and are hungry, this is a good option."

            "review": "Let me start by saying this review is very overdue! Secondly, GO TO NOVE ITALIANO!!!\n\nI had been to this restaurant back in 2010 and remembered the juicy and delicious steak that was prepared back then. I decided it would be the perfect place to host my friend's 21st birthday!\n\nWe had made reservations for my friend in the beginning of March. I had made a reservation online, noting it was my friend's birthday. When we were running a tad late (Vegas does that to you), we called to inform the front desk we were running about an hour behind. The friendliest hostess answered the phone and let us know it wouldn't be a problem at all.\n\nWhen we arrived, they sat our party of 4 near the window where we were greeted with the best view. As my memory escapes me, I cannot recall our server's name. However, from the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. Between our waters never emptying, our drinks constantly flowing and our table looking impeccable at all times, It was as though we had 3 servers tending to us alone! The manager, Marques, was checked on us a few times. He was kind, friendly, and showed us a wonderful evening! Not crowding us, but eventually joining us in our party as the evening carried on. Marques made sure that we continued our wonderful evening by providing us with tickets to Ghostbar for free entry. Eventually, the chef came to greet us as well!\n\nBetween us, we had the chicken marsala, the filet, a caeser salad, and the chicken parmigiana. We shared this and the extra sides they brought to us. Every morsel was savory, tender, and delicious. The Chef not only treated us to several specialty appetizers but a wonderful birthday dessert in a large martini glass-on the house! \n\nAs a special birthday gift, the bar also treated us to 4 espresso shots. Unfortunately, I am allergic to coffee beans (weirdest and most unfortunate allergy ever). When we casually mentioned it to the server (since there was an untouched shot at the table) they quickly remedied the problem-despite it being a gift!\n\nFrom the great food to the amazing service and friendly staff, this dining experience MADE our trip to Vegas. Thank you, Nove Italiano!"

However, due to forces that we could not control (i.e. hostess error & incompetence), our reservations were not listed and thus we were sent to Nove. Although Nove attempted to live up to the reputation of Nine, however, they failed ... completely.  The one redeeming quality was the wine storage facility.  It was pretty. It changed colors... many times."

My husband and I arrived early (around 6pm) and we were the only ones in the whole place and we received top notch service.  We requested a window view and they seated us in the front room that faces the strip with cozy little fire-boxes in the windows.  The wait staff was super attentive and friendly and the food was awesome!  My husband and I were both craving pasta so I had the Pennette alla Vodka and my husband had the Sunday Gravy.  Both were excellent.  Nove Italiano was a great way to cap off another fantastic Vegas trip."

It is a special occasion kind of place. I've been there on my birthday and recently for a friend's birthday. I love the view from the top and if you get to sit on the second floor, the view is way better than sitting on the bottom floor with the curtains covering the view! I love the colors and decorations in the restaurant, beautiful! It's classy, romantic, kinda place you want to take pictures. It is more of a dress up in your hoochiest clothes you can find kinda place with all the girls ready to go to the clubs at the Palms,  but I don't let that bother me. \n\nMy first time there the chef supposedly sent us samples of his new salads. He gave us 2 different kinds of salads to each person at our table-for free. That was cool. Both time I ordered the Nove Spaghetti. The first time I ordered a full order and the 2nd time going there I ordered the 1/2 order. You barely get anything in the 1/2 order, but all my friends who ordered 1/2 orders of their pastas got decent size portions. I would order a half order of something else besides the signature pasta. I am happy with that pasta, but I have also tried my friends pennette alla vodka with gulf shrimp and that was very good. \n\nThe desserts here are excellent. I think people who spend alot of money at this restaurant, they drink. Since I don't drink, I think the prices are decent for what you get. \n\nThe last time we went we were walked into Playboy/Moon which was very convenient and saved us time and possibly money of waiting in line with several guys in our party. \n\nI will go here anytime! If you can get a table near the fireplace by the window, you must be VIP, I can't seem to find out how people get those tables which are the most private and the best."

It was everything I hoped for in a fine dining experience, but also lived up to a posh, upscale vibe, that wasn't tacky... something I didn't expect to find in Vegas.\n\nThe decor is clean and unique.  We were fortunate enough to sit in a long corridor of the dining room that gave breath taking views of he strip.  Aligning the booths were towering bushes in the form of female silhouettes.  The manager was nice enough to take photos of us and bring us to a second level bar area for more photo ops. \n\nThe service was phenomenal.  We had a pair of gentleman waiters--one for our beverages and the other for our meal.  They both gave great recommendations and were extremely attentive.  The flow of the dinner was natural.  Not once did I feel as though we were waiting too long or that anything came out too quickly.  Oftentimes, my water was refilled or a plate was cleared and I didn't notice, they were like service magicians.\n\nEverything we tried was tasty.  The calamari appetizer had a unique banana pepper twist and was cooked perfectly.  They also presented us with a complimentary amuse bouche.  I was boring and ordered penne with bolognese sauce.  The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and I normally don't find when ordering pasta dishes at other restaurants.  I forget what the name of my boyfriend's pasta, however it was a lighter take on a stuffed noddle with a cream sauce, still delicious.\n\nOur Nove dining experience was exceptional and everything I had hoped for when visiting Las Vegas.  The ambiance was intimate and updated, the service prompt and friendly, and the food savory spins on classic dishes.  I would love to go back on my next visit to Vegas or at the very least visit other restaurants in the Nine family."

My wife had the Chicken Marsala loaded with about 5 types of shrooms.  Both were excellent choices.  Food top notch, wine selection above average but not the best.  I would recommend it to friends who wanted a good, more upscale, night-out, Italian meal in vegas.\n\nThe ambiance is a bit clubby and there was plenty of cheese present as well, rounded out by a few older guys whom I always see in these younger, hipper restaurants.

Oh yea, and those espresso martinis that eventually led to me jumping into a pool fully clothed at a private party. \n\nFood - averagish Italian food. Massive portions. Seriously, like every other place in Veags, they dish out TONS of food. Probably only need to order 2 appetizers and one entree for three people... at least for 3 females. \n\nAfter dinner, we slipped one of the managers a twenty and were whisked right into the Club, no line! \n\nNothing quite like getting in the backdoor at the Playboy Club."

The food took another whole hour and we saw the water boy the most, no joke.  I ordered the filet medium. It was mooing. It was so raw I could barely eat it. All in all everyone's else's food was decent but when I'm forced to tip some a@@hat waiter over 10%percent because it was included, then have him mess up the bill so royally we have to sit for another 40 minutes, I will pass on ever going and or recommending this place to anyone....

As of the dinner a couple of weeks ago, the white was a pinot grigio and the red was a blend. \n\nThe one requirement is that everyone at the table participates in the deal. With a party of three or four, everyone could dine family style. Between the three of us; we got two different appetizers, two second courses, two entrees, and cheesecake for dessert. The gulf shrimp franchaise is one of the best dishes offered that night. The large shrimp are butterflied, lightly battered, and fried before being tosses in a rich lemon sauce. I was using the complimentary bread to sop up the excess sauce. The margherita pizza should be passed upon. It is a disappointment in comparison to the shrimp. Both second course items are delicious. The salad is light and refreshing. The lightly toss the greens in a vinaigrette. The meatballs are just that, but they are good. We were already full by entree time. How we were going to put away the chicken alfredo, rigatoni bolognese, and truffle salmon was beyond me. I had a few bites of each. The tomato sauces are Nove's strong point. I loved the sauce from the meatballs and their bolognese was on point. By dessert time, we were ready to die. \n\nWe had a dinner reservation at 6:00 and had to be out by 7:15 to go see Kenny Chesney. They were great at accommodating us. I hate being those people who don't allot enough time when going to a sit down restaurant, but they were great at just producing dish after dish in a timely manner."

We had been at the restaurant for at least 40 minutes before we finally had a drink.   When we needed new drinks, it took another 15+ minutes and they were not delivered near the same time even if they were ordered together.   \n  I wanted to order their seafood special, but by the time we got to ordering I wasn't sure if the kitchen was as awful as the rest of the staff and went with the veggie lasagna to prepare myself for minimal food poisoning.

I booked a reservation for two and we had to take a cab as the Palms Resort is off the main roads, but it didn't take long to get there. We got directions from the concierge and were able to hop the elevator to 51st floor and be treated to a scene of the setting sun over the strip, the mountains and the desert. Oh yes, that is so worth it.\n\nOur reservation was relatively early so the restaurant wasn't busy at all and we had a lot of attention from the waitstaff. We were seated quickly and someone came over to discuss the wine options with us as we went over the various menu choices we were likely going to go with. We chose our wines and also ordered what sounded like an insanely rich and amazing appetizer called Gnudi (ricotta cheese with brown butter and sage). We were also served small bits of bread that were very tasty but we tried to limit so we'd have room for our main course.\n\nNot long after finishing off the delicious appetizer, our main dishes came out: the walnut tomato pesto ravioli for me and tortellini with truffles and large thin slices of pancetta on top. Both dishes were melt-in-your-mouth *delicious* (I snuck bits of the tortellini out from underneath the pancetta to try it out). Rich, intense, this was some of the best Italian I've eaten in a long time. On top of that, the servings were generous and I had a hard time finishing what was in my plate. This wasn't four pieces of ravioli with a bit of sauce on top, it was a full size serving that would leave you feeling full even without an appetizer. Despite the allure of the dessert menu, we skipped over the sweets as we were way too full of pasta and cheese and wine.\n\nDue to the size of the servings, we also felt like the price was fair as well. It's a pretty decent high end restaurant so the prices are up there, but the quality and serving sizes more than make up for it. The service was also top-of-the-line and our waiter was funny and smart and extremely helpful. He was on top of making sure our water glasses were topped off and making sure our needs were met. We were more than happy to leave a generous tip on top of our bill.\n\nOut of the various restaurants I've gone to in Vegas, Nove is definitely at the top of the list for one of the best experiences I've had in the past 10 years. I would recommend it to anyone if you're looking for a good Italian experience with a beautiful view of the city."

And it wasn't just me, a number of people had the same exact problem.\n\nSo for starters, we had some sort of sushi thing (odd for an italian restaurant but OK), an antipasto plate which was standard but good, and a shellfish plate consisting of oysters, mussels, crab legs, shrimp, and lobster.  This was the only excellent part of the meal.  Go figure, its the element of the meal that required the least amount of preparation.\n\nWe also had a primi piatti of linguini with shrimp and a spicy sauce which was decent.  The problems arose during the secondi piatti.  I ordered the 24 oz. Ribeye steak.  It came out essentially raw in the middle.  I typically like my steak medium rare, so I don't mind a little blood or pinkness in my steak.  But this thing was uncooked in the middle.  And I wasn't the only one.  I think 4 people in my party had to have their steak brought back to the broiler.  And if that wasn't enough, the sides were terrible as well.  The broccolini and polenta basically tasted like nothing.  I am still trying to figure out if the chef simply forgot to season the dishes.  Hopefully, I will never have to go to this restaurant again.  With excellent restaurants such as Nine and Alize residing in the Palms, I fear for the future of this restaurant.\n\nI only gave the restaurant 2 stars because the shellfish plate was great and the service was decent."

While it's Italian, I've only had the Filet as my main course. The reason why is it's one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. This place is always on point.  The d\u00e9cor is good and the Las Vegas skyline as a view can't be topped.  If you want to celebrate an occasion in Las Vegas, I highly recommend Nove Italiano."

We had to wait on a few more people to show up. We order some standard drinks to start the night. After waiting we were seating in a table with a view of the other tower. It was so beautiful. We had some cool big booty bushes. We started the meal with a champagne toast and then also order a bottle. They were clearing some inventory so we got a bottle for like $40. We started with the meatball appetizer and started to order our entrees. I started with a Caesar salad and also ordered the 8oz filet mignon. The Caesar salad came out with full romaine leafs which was different but cool. Everyone ordered something a little different. My coworker ordered the pennine alla vodka and it was yummy. I love vodka. I mean i love vodka sauces. :) \nDuring our meals we also ordered some drinks. There were jager shots, lemon drops, Moscow mules, and even the tiramisu cocktail. All the drinks were delicious and make to look exquisite. After some drink I was surprised by some yummy dessert. There was cheesecake and chocolates and just yumm in my mouth. I was really glad we got to enjoy Nove. The manager even stopped by the table and gave us his card. He was so nice and asked about the meal. It was a wonderful experience and I couldn't have ask for a better night."

The food is good, but after being spoiled with the best Italian food at Parma, my standards are set bit high for every Italian restaurant in Vegas. \n\nMy favorite Italian meal is not pasta, but risotto. The best risotto I've had was in a small hole in the wall joint in NJ. The creaminess of the risotto from the quality of the rice used is the key thing in a risotto. The risotto at Nove was creamy but the quality of the rice was questionable. It was chewy and some of the rice seemed bit under cooked. I would recommend Parma over Nove purely based on the quality of food and service."

We were hooked up with a dinner here from a Vegas promoter and our group of girls couldn't be any more disappointed with the food. I'm sure if we tried the food off their regular menu it would have been fine but what they served us was so basic! Caesar salad, penne pasta with tomato sauce, margherita pizza... I mean, really? There was no meat in any of the dishes! Not only that, but they sat us in the lounge area behind the bar which had tables like coffee tables and chairs/couches that were all different so it was nearly impossible to get our entire group of 10 to sit together and to eat properly. When I asked if we could be moved to the normal dining area to be more comfortable the hostess said, \"This is where we sit all our VIP guests.\" Ok, whatever, didn't make any sense to me. They had to move the furniture several times so we could actually sit close enough together without having to yell across the tables to have a conversation. \n\nI will say though that in spite of everything I mentioned, the hostess and servers we had were super accommodating and provided great service. We also got two rounds of drinks and a round of shots on the house, which was unexpected to us since we were told drinks were not included with our package. I can't recall the name of the drink but try the one with grapefruit soda and grey goose. It was muy excellente!! One of the best drinks I've had!"

Why risk going anywhere else when you've found a good solid Resturant and they treat you like royalty. \n\nBeing that we never roll in less the 8 plus people deep the check is never under a grand but it's all worth it. The decor is super luxury chic, the back room with fire place and naked bushes over looks the Las Vegas valley with amazing views of the light that just glitters oh so perfectly in the night sky. \n\nThe Resturant staff are always so polite and professional our favorite Kasey who has moved on to SW stake house always waited on use every time we go. The drinks are impeccable and the food....oh the food! First you must try the Nove spaghetti, now this is no regular spaghetti it is a seafood spaghetti with all sorts of goodies in it mix with their amazing house pasta with their perfect red sauce with the right amount of chunk not too thick and far from tart I hate tart sour red sauce. OMG it's so good. Then there is their rosemary bone in stake....Ummm always order stake bone in if you can the extra added flavor it gives if phenomenal ask for a side of wine reduction because they do it just perfect here and a side of their wild mushroom saut\u00e9ed delicious! \n\nBesides that the whole menu is Devine from the veal to all of the apps and sides you can't go wrong. Perfect place for a romantic dinner date for 2 or like us a party of 10 music is hip, noise level is loud but the atmosphere is right. I love this place and I think you will too!"

Calamari salad was amazing A+ I'd only go back for that.  They brought over salmon on spoons none of us eat that and something else we didn't like so it escapes my memory. I got a chopped salad to start w/ all kinds of things in it, that was very good. My aunt got a pizza [she's 75 and easy] and her friend got a chicken and pasta dish that was covered in mushrooms which I don't eat. She seemed to like that.  Food was good, not great, but good.\n\nBads\n1) got to the hostess downstairs, asked her how busy it was did we need a reservation, etc. She said 'nope' you can go right up now. You have to take an elevator up [meh] got to the hostess stand upstairs and that's when things started going horribly wrong.  She said it would be a bit of time. I'm thinking like 5 mins max [mind you downstairs girl was like go right up seemed easy]  We sat down by the bar. we waited, we waited some more.  Other people came in sat down. waited some more. 20 mins later I went back up to the hostess stand and basically ripped her a new one. We were immediately sat.\n\n2) Restaurant was ubber busy guess there was a convention in town or something. They kept putting the fat people on the ends of the tables and they were spilling into the walkways so navigating out and/or to the restroom was difficult. Had to have our waiter help me ask some people to get up [while they were eating their meals -cringe] so we could get by them. wasn't a big fan of that.\n\n3) Long wait for table and a longer wait for food. Took about 2 hours for us to eat here, luckily we didn't have anywhere to go.  I actually got so annoyed I just handed the waiter my credit card w/out even looking at the bill so we could get out of there.\n\n\n\nAs you can see my bads are more verbose, I'd maybe try it again, if I happened to be at that hotel; however I would not make a reservation and travel to this hotel just for this place."

I found it quite odd that they were so open for the night and the rest of the week, and exclaimed that I did not need to make a reservation.  Many of the restaurants I dine with require a day or more advanced reservation; some even a week or more.  \n\nThe decor of this restaurant is absolutely stunning, but that's where the stunning ends.  I brought a very rare and expensive bottle of wine for dinner, and was unable to enjoy it.  Apparently they have a non-corkage policy, which is fine, except that this is not mentioned on their website, and their wine list is deplorable.  Ended up drinking water with dinner! \n\nNext comes the wait staff, who was a self-proclaimed Thomas Keller trained waiter.  I find this hard to believe because, we had no waiter during the course of our dinning experience.  I have family and friends that work at the French Laundry, and various Thomas Keller restaurants, and I can say this waiter has never seen Thomas Keller.  I must mention though that our busser was absolutely amazing, and I wish he was our waitstaff.  \n\nNext, we received two appetizers that were complete onion bombs; my guess is to hide the flavor of the fish. Again not impressed, and the bread that came along was stale.  Finally the meal arrives, and I must say that it was delicious, but very over priced.  I could get the same thing in the Napa Valley for half the price and ten times the taste.  The duck I had was over cooked, and their were no vegetables served with any of the meals.  The chicken marsala was good, but the sauce was too gravy like in consistency.\n\nAll in all the service is better at your local Taco Bell, the food is mediocre and over priced, and the wine list can be described in one word: \"Crap.\"  Anyone that gave this place 5 stars does not know a thing about fine dinning.  I generously gave this place two stars, and that was because of the decor.  My recommendation (i.e., if you want to fill your nightly reservations) for this restaurant would be to fire the chef, get a wait staff, and add a corkage."

The restaurant is near the top of the Palms, so the view is really nice.  Although there were tables next to the windows, they seated us in the interior of the restaurant.  There were a couple of window side seats, but they weren't clean, so I guess they didn't want to take the 30 seconds to clean the table?  I think that was a misstep - there were only two other sets of guests!\n\nLike I said the place is large and decorated nicely, but it probably needs an updating. They have a long bar that actually looks cool, but of course no one there.\n\nWe ordered the octopus and beet carpaccio salad.  The octopus was ok, but the beet carpaccio needed something to spruce it up, because is was bland.\n\nI had the ravioli for an entree, which had ricotta cheese, pancetta, other odds and ends in a lemon butter sauce.  It was delicious.  Very good.  It was actually surprising how good it was.\n\nThis place has potential, but there really isn't anything that sticks out about it, other than the view.  Maybe a little investment in the decor, tighten up the menu, and don't let 20 year old hostesses seat the guests, and they could probably make something of this place."

Our host greeted us with roses and noted it would be just a moment. The view is nothing short of spectacular. Music was jusssst right (Doors, Stones, classic rock & groovy hits) and happened to be our favorite genre. Luis & Israel to this day have been the BEST class and service in Vegas we have ever received, always timely, courteous and had us laughing the entire dinner! My wife tried Chicken Marsala which was cooked to perfection and I enjoyed the Ravioli so much I WILL become a regular! Thanks NOVE!"

Take away the eye sore chandeliers and the choice of sparkly wall decorations behind the bar, the ambiance was workin. \n \nThe grilled octopus and shrimp appetizers were great.  The shrimp was coupled with a garlic butter sauce that was light yet complimented the shrimp well. \n\nDespite the infamous N9NE steakhouse next door, I was in the mood for some red meat.  I ordered the 24 ounce rib eye steak, while my date went ahead and ordered the tuna.  Both were delicious.  The side of spinach that came with the steak was enough to feed 4 people fyi.  \n\nWe didn't have room in the belly for dessert, but apparently it was a huge rookie mistake on my part to skip out on the sweets. Oh well, there's always round 2."

Not knowing this I tipped another 20 bucks. No where on my voucher, menu, restaurant, website, waiter telling us did it clearly state that a 20% gratuity would be added ON ALL PURCHASES. Not only that it was based on the value of the meal which is arbitrary at best. I now noticed travelzoo has $410 dollar value voucher for $99 for almost the exact same thing.....well except instead of a $62 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal they will get an $82 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal. Food was sub par at best. My gf and I didn't even finish it all or want to take it home. BEWARE of this place. If you want somewhere nice in the Palms try ALIZE they are 10x better and a whole heck of a lot cheaper which is sad because they were a lot fancier than this place."

It's very romantic so  good place to go on a date.  Service is great with attentive waiters.  They start you off with a sample of three of their focaccia breads.  For the main course, I ordered the shrimp scampi which turned out to be a very sour dish.  Not sure if they added a lot of lemon or if the tomatoes were sour but the entire dish was sour.  Not exactly what I expected for a pasta dish.  The shrimp tasted like it had been frozen so didn't seem fresh.  For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu which had pistachio ice cream on top.  The ice cream was soft and creamy but the tiramisu itself was way too sweet and tasted stale, like it had been left outside for a long time.  I finished the ice cream but only had a couple bites of the tiramisu.  I've been to better Italian places so don't really recommend coming here unless you want to pay for the view of the Vegas skyline from the restaurant."

After being directed to an exclusive elevator up to the 51st floor, we were greeted by a gorgeous view of a Palms tower and the Vegas city lights. It was absolutely breathtaking!\n\nWe started out with cocktails. I ordered a peach bellini that turned out to be more Prosecco than anything else (but that's okay because I love Prosecco). The table bread was a trio of Italian with cheese, crispy breadsticks reminiscent of fried wonton strips, and the star of the platter - fresh foccacia. For our appetizer, we decided to share the grilled octopus. That was delicious - beautifully charred without being burnt, well-seasoned, and on top of it all, the dish consisted of whole baby octopi (as opposed to slices and dices of larger octopi).\n\nI had been wanting to try the Nove Spaghetti since we made our reservation two weeks ago, and it turned out we both ordered the same entree. It certainly did not disappoint! I was surprised to discover that the pasta was a mix of regular spaghetti and squid ink spaghetti, both freshly made. The tomato sauce was pleasantly seafood-y and they were generous with the shrimp, scallop, lobster, and squid. The shrimp was perfectly cooked (one of my biggest food pet peeves is overcooked shrimp) and the scallop was wonderfully soft and firm at the same time. Loved it!\n\nEven though we were feeling pretty full, we ordered the Nutella Tower for dessert. The presentation was impressive, but the semi-freddo was just too sweet for us.\n\nService was superb and the atmosphere was classy and trendy. Honestly, it was the best birthday dinner yet!"

Service was fine but not at par for the top restaurants in Vegas.  The room is pretty and has a great view.  Had the spaghetti carbonara, was very good, and the seasonal swordfish. The fish was prepared nicely, but the potatoes were coated in cheese and beyond heavy.  The death by potatoes was better, but nothing as good as the Robuchon potatoes at Bazaar Meat.  Bread pudding was fair, which is still worth eating but overall disappointing, too heavy and swimming in a cream that didn't appeal to me. Prices are more moderate than many others in Vegas and appropriate for the quality of food and service. I won't need to go back."

They required a deposit on a credit card to hold the reservation. \n\nThe decor is very Vegas. Walls were made from Crocodile printed leather. Everyone was like, \"it reminds me of Brett Michaels\". That's the kinda vibe we got but more polished.  On the plus side, the diners get a view of Vegas - reminiscent of Aqua in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, we had a large party & missed out on the view because we were seated in a private room that was basically a box with a door. Noise levels were high, and we didn't realize how loud it was out there until the doors were closed. It'd be really hard to converse if I weren't sitting right next to my friend. \n\nOur server was Joe, when he came in, the first thing he asked was to greet the person who made the reservation - also happened to be named Joe. Joe the server was a nice guy, but he was really slow. Granted we had a big party, we would probably see him every half hour or so. The other two servers were good with water refilling, but not so great at remembering the additional tidbits.\n\nDuring our extremely long wait, I went to use the restroom, and as I walked in I noticed the honeycombed walls made from bronze and stainless steel. I felt like I was trapped in a beehive. The layout of the restroom was really odd. They had two stalls to the left, the sink in the center, and one right next to the sink. Just my luck, I got the one next to the sink. I didn't think much of it until I went in. Not only am I only a foot away from someone washing their hands, there was also a 2 inch gap in stall door. I know it's the Palms and everything there revolves around sex, but please, I have no interest in anyone seeing my cooch. I'm at Nove not the Playboy Club. \n\nHere's what I had for dinnner:\n\nCrispy Canoli: $16 (comp. of the chef)\nI only tried the king crab one and thought it was gross. The pastry part was fine, just the filling was not to my liking. \n\nEggplant: $12 (cotf)\nNot bad but not memorable either. \n\nSicilian Crab Cakes: $18\nThis wasn't a cop out of a crab cake. You can taste the crab, and it was topped with something sweet that really made it stand out. I believe it was tomato and baccala. \n\nCeasar Salad: $12 \nLoved it! The salad was topped with anchovies. Fresh and delish!\n\nLobster Minestone: $14\nLuke Warm. Not exciting and the beans could've been cooked longer. \n\nNove Spagehtti: $43 - One of the signature dishes\nThis dish had a lot of flavor, but it would be something you'd tire of after about 1/3 of it. I liked the pasta though. It was a mix of their own reg pasta and a green version, I'm assuming was made from spinach. \n\n24 oz. Bone in Rib Eye: $52 \n+  8 year aged Balsamico: $10\nThe Rib eye was really big & tasted okay (by far, better than Boa)..  but for 62, I expected more.  But I did like how they give you options of different glazes or sauces. \n\nNove Gnocchi: $12\nVery heavy and packed with flavor. It's great to try a bite or two, but you can't stomach the entire thing. My friend who's Italian said the gnocchi was decent, but of course he's had much, much better. I myself have never stumbled upon really good, authentic gnocchi. \n\nAll in all, the dinner was fine, but I wouldn't go back for a full meal. I'd just want the ceasar salad and maybe some crab cakes.  \n\nThe entree portions are fairly large and flavorful. I recommend sharing so you're not stuck with one dish that you'll get sick of. Even though I split 2 entrees, I still didn't finish everything. Our server also advised us that the main 4 antipastas and contornis were meant to be shared family style."

Had a Groupon, so we had a different menu than the regular one but I had been forewarned at time of purchase. According to the Groupon you had to make a reservation,  did so on here, Nove even called an hr before to confirm. Nice touch. It's inside the Palms, you check-in and take an elevator ride up to one of the top floors and are escorted to your table. Hubby and I had tickets for a show so we had an early dinner (6pm) Tuesday evening and we were the only ones in there, which was awesome because we had a beautiful view and it felt like the restaurant was open just for us. (Ok, so I was having a delusion of grandeur mixed with romantic sentiment, sue me.) The decor is classy yet comfortable and everyone who greeted us made us feel very welcome.\n\nThe food. We had four courses, which was good (taste-wise) and bad (limited choices). Started off with sparkling wine. Prosecco. Delicious.  Got another glass to go with my meal. Arugala salad, also very good. Rigatoni was savory but I couldn't finish it because tomato sauce gives me heartburn but still really good. I got the chicken picatta and the Mr. got steak. Chicken was good but hubby's steak was divine with horseradish potatoes. For dessert, we got cheesecake which was also very good. They even brought me birthday biscotti. Awesome! In all a pretty good meal right? So why four stars and not five? My Groupon included two espresso cocktails that never showed, honestly I was kinda bummed that our waiter forgot since he had done such a good job with everything else but halfway through our meal a big party did show up and we saw less and less of our waiter which was weird because they were seated right next to us. So when the bill came and no cocktails did, I was already done trying to get his attention and ready to go since we did have to catch a show. Should I have spoken up? Yes, most definitely but who brings you biscotti and forgets the espresso. He did not even see us off, the manager did, at the elevators as we were leaving, which was nice but a little too late.  I honestly felt that had we not had the Groupon (which had included 20% tip),  service would had been a little more attentive. In all, I would probably go again but without a Groupon because the food was done very well but the service could have been better, actually I pretty sure it would be because the big group next to us was getting an overabundance of it."

The waitstaff was very attentive, the food was tasty, and the view can't be beat!\nWe ordered two side dishes as appetizers--Nana's meatballs and Death by Potatoes.  The meatballs were oh so delicious, but I wasn't impressed by the potatoes.  It was basically whipped potatoes with about a stick of butter on them, with a couple of garnishes of chives and bacon.  Not bad, but not worth $11, in my opinion.  My husband has a different opinion, though :).  He loved them!  \nFor our entrees, we ordered their signature dish, Nove Spaghetti and the baked penne.  My husband was in heaven with the spaghetti, which is a seafood dish.  If you love seafood, he highly recommends it.  The penne was a generous portion.  After eating bread and the appetizers, I only finished about a third of my pasta.  \nWe shared a cannoli plate for dessert.  It was fun to make your own, but the filling wasn't great.  \nOverall, a very pleasant and tasty meal.  My only complaint is that it was really loud in there.  I don't know if it was just from the bar, or if they had a private party in the back, or what.  Sometimes we couldn't hear each other talk, and we were sitting right next to each other.  \nOverall, a great dinner.  We will definitely be back."

The standout appetizers would be the baby octopus, raviolo and calamari.  I had the Sunday Gravy pasta the last time which included braciole, sausage, meatballs and pork gravy.  Heart attack on a plate!  It felt so wrong yet sooooo right.  The Nove spaghetti, pansotti (short ribs, brown butter, hazelnuts, spinach) and veal Nove were also very memorable from past visits.  The dessert menu is decent if you actually have room for it.  \n\nThis would be a great place to take some first timers visiting LV since you could cover a lot they would want to see in one evening.  Just make sure to have dinner a bit later than usual so you can enjoy the festivities upstairs when you're full as a bull."

Strip view and the famous Palms sign! \n2- the Food is always a winner. I can always count on it being on point. Was never a disappointment \n3- the Staff - feels like family! Very friendly and welcoming and you never feel rushed! Thats what i like about this place. \n4- the Chef! -- Mr. Marlon Simbulan always cooks up a menu like no other. Expanding my palette to a different level. *\n5--the Kitchen staff -- without these people, working hard to cook and make the food you got the whole package deal here..:\n\nI met my quota of the year with Nove and its good to know that im excited to see what the new year will bring to this restaurant for the next year to come! Bring it on 2015!! Coz ill back back!! --marivic97"

When we got a bit too rowdy, they would simply slide the glass doors shut.  \n\nWe started with a caviar bellini and a champagne toast - Yay Vegas!  Both were fantastic.  Appetizers were abundant and tasty.  I've never had Rice Balls before and was surprised how yummy they were.  Deep fried rice balls with marinara sauce for dipping - oh yeah.  The Calamari was fresh and light.  The Crudo (salmon ceviche) was amazing.  I thought it had a spicy kick but 2 others said they didn't taste a kick, but loved it.  The Sausage Pizza looked delicious and was served on a pizza stone, but I'm sticking to my vegetarian diet so I didn't try it.  The last item was Crostacei a seafood selection on ice of crab legs, oysters, lobster, clams and shrimp - all delicate and delicious.\n\nNext came the caesar salad (without anchovies) and it was perfect.  I chose the Ahi Tuna rare for my entree.  The Eggplant Caponata the Ahi sat on was just OK.  But the Death By Potatoes on the side was fantastic.  The Crispy Garlic Potatoes were too crispy for my end of the table.  \n\nDuring dinner we enjoyed a Pinot from Willamette Valley in Oregon and a Rothschild.  Both were perfect.  After dinner they served great Espresso's and even made mine decaf.\n\nWe skipped out before dessert to go upstairs to the Playboy Club.  The staff at Nove were fantastic and knowledgeable.  Cesar, our main server, made sure we never wanted for anything.  It was a great night."

The review is a travesty of lies.  Now, for the truth....\n\nNove is an elegant, yet contemporary/casual gem of an Italian Restaurant located on the 51st floor of the Palms hotel, in Vegas.  You are greeted on the main floor, outside the elevator, by a lovely and pleasant hostess who confirms your reservation (assuming you are wise enough to book one, and I highly recommend you do) and directs you to the somewhat hidden elevator behind you.\n\nUpon arriving in the restaurant proper, a lovely trio of equally pleasant young ladies, dressed classily in black dresses, not too short, but short enough, with genuine and warm smiles escort you to your table.  Even the wives thought it was a nice touch.\n\nAt the table, our waiter was courteous, respectful, informative and prompt.  He also made a point of not constantly overwhelming us with incessantly asking if everything was ok.  He was good enough to let us enjoy our meal and conversation, without being obtrusive. (If you are reading this Tony, thanks again for an excellent evening).  The sommelier was a pleasant young lady who clearly knew her wine.  My comrade is a bit of a connosieur and they conversed knowledgeably about our choice for the evening, a fruity and potent Amarone, which, as it turns out, was a marvellous compliment to the meal, despite the prevalence of seafood\n\nFinally, the food.  Yes, some (and I repeat...SOME) of the choices were expensive, but not all.  Clearly, one will always pay a bit of a premium for seafood, as well as the location of the restaurant.  Well seafood was abundant on the menu, and it was fresh and succulent.  The appetizer Shrimp Francaise literally melted on your tongue with a delicious, buttery sweetness.  The flat bread with littleneck clams was crisp, light, tender, and thoroughly enjoyable.  The peak of the evening was the Pasta Nove.  Black and white, homemade spaghetti with clams, shrimp, crab, lobster and scallop.  It was one of the finest seafood pastas I ever had.  And I am Italian!  Yes it was expensive (over 40 dollars), but that dish would cost over 30 dollars anywhere.  For the view and the quality, it was worth every penny.\n\nNow you know the truth!"

When the check came, the server said no rush,  however he had no problem grabbing the check to see if we had put a card or cash in it!!!   There were so many empty booths and seats there no reason to rush our celebration!!!!!  I recommend to everyone not to visit this establishment.

            "review": "Came here with my cousin after buying the Travel Zoo deal and unfortunately read the below reviews about the deal being junk. Not the case! We chose to go on a Sunday evening as the fancy last meal in Vegas. \n\nWe made a reservation for 7:15pm, showed up, and were immediately seated. At this time, the restaurant was semi-busy but it got to be quite loud and packed around 8:30-9. Avoid going at these times if you would like to hear anyone speak at your table.\n\nWe were brought a menu with the dishes we would be served that evening, and were poured our complimentary champagne. A plate of margarita pizza was the first to arrive was fairly tasty. Cracker-thin crust and a very light spread of tomato sauce and cheese. Following it was a meat and cheese plate, calamari, and gnocchi with a meat ragu. I don't eat pork and don't prefer calamari and so I avoided those, but the gnocchi were very light and delicious. \n\nFor mains, we had salmon with spinach, and chicken parmigiana.  The salmon was very delicious and I really enjoyed having spinach as a side as there weren't any other vegetables throughout the meal. The chicken was blah. Very saucy. Tough meat. Blah. While portions looked to be on the small side for 2 people, there was no way we could get through all of this. \n\nService was amazing throughout our meal. Our water glasses were never less than 1/2 full and plates were quickly bused off our table as soon as we put our forks down. My sister joined us at the restaurant and ordered separately and was very delighted with her meal.\n\nIt's true that they minus what the original cost of what the meal would have been, from your bill. So you get a bill that is $320 and then they credit your voucher and you pay tax and tip on top. Not the best procedure as my heart certainly flipped when I saw $320 on there, but they take care of you and it's a lovely meal.\n\nA word of caution not to use this deal on a Sunday evening. We did and figured we would just go to Ghostbar to check out the view. Low and behold, it was closed for a private event and so we lost out on that portion of the deal. Try a Friday or Saturday instead to get your full money's worth. Also check a directory when you get to the hotel as the Nove elevators are at the opposite side to the doors."

We got complimentary bread to start off with while our waiter brought out our drinks.\n\nMy baked penne pasta with sausages and brocolini was definitely nothing to write home about. It's very filling because it's covered in a thick layer of cheese. I'm not a big fan of cheese....especially if it's overboard like that. The sauce was a semi-spicy tomato sauce.

Ladies Night, TravelZoo, etc, apparently its all code for \"eat shit food and pay for it\". And when I say pay for it, I mean on multiple levels.\n\nI'm too irritated to give an overly detailed review, but here's the hit list:\n\nWaiting to be seated for a reservation we were already (apologetically) late for, slow service, a booth tucked into the otherwise empty corner of an extremely low ceilinged overhang that meant we could see nothing of the famous Nove view of Vegas (and this in a half empty restaurant) and felt like we were quarantined from the rest of the guests, cold extremely oversalted food, empty water glasses (I think they were pissed we asked for tap after they only offered us Fiji or San Pellegrino, like tap water doesn't even exist in such an upscale establishment), club music during dinner, improperly paced and delivered courses, unprofessional wait staff.\n\nI really think it boils down to management and staff assuming that people who come in courtesy of these \"deals\" are lesser guests, lesser citizens, and are given less hospitality. To be sat in a corner of an otherwise empty section of a restaurant when there were numerous tables with views and actual other diners nearby which sat empty before, during and after our meal is horrible. \n\nI also think that they are doing the food for these \"deals\" in mass quantities, and it is being pre-cooked and help improperly. Fried items were cold, tough and limp, the chicken parmigiana reminded me of a low quality frozen dinner in texture and taste, and I'm still dehydrated from the over dose of salt that was present in every course, right down to the salted chocolate ganache for dessert. But the worst, absolutely WORST, was the salmon. We left the entire entree untouched.\n\nMaybe the regular menu is great. Maybe. But I'll never know because if this is how Nove chooses to treat guests who partake of the tasting menus they themselves advertise (which, by the way, should be used as a chance to showcase the restaurant and garner repeat business) poorly. I will never, ever return."

Before buying the deal online, I followed the instructions of the deal and made a reservation online to make sure there was availability for the night/time we wanted.  My friends just happened to call the restaurant about something that Friday and they were told they didn't have record of the reservation.  I called them b/c I had printed out the confirmation of the reservation like I was prompted to do.  The girl I spoke to simply told me they didn't have record of it because their online reservation system doesn't work that well.  She acted like that was a good excuse and completely understandable.  When someone books an online reservation and gets a confirmation, it is fair to believe that they will have a reservation.  She offered us a really early time slot (6 p.m.) with no apologies and said that was all she could do.  I was willing to do that but then I was told that the deal we bought couldn't be honored at all that weekend because they had already booked all the deals for those nights.  Since I was only in town for the weekend, I figured they would be flexible due to the fact that the issue resulted from their online reservation system not working.  Nope...nothing.  When I asked to speak to a manager, I was transferred and waited for almost 2 minutes of ringing before I hung up.  I decided to call back and got another girl.  When I mentioned that I was waiting to speak to a manager, she told me they wouldn't be in for at least 3 hours.  That made me even more upset because the girl transferred me knowing full well that no one would be there to help me.  I then explained the situation, left my name/number and asked for a manager to call when they did get it.  The result...NOTHING.  I'm sure this restaurant has good food but when it comes to service, it stinks.  They need to take a lesson in customer service.  An experience this can sour a person on a place forever and that's just what it did with me and I won't be shy to tell others.  Consider yourselves warned...."

When I go back with friends and we want a nice dinner, it will NOT be here, just because of that that little bitch. There are far too many nice restaurants in Vegas to choose from and first impressions are everything. If I'm dining at the Palms, I'll stick to Alize, which was wonderful when I ate there."

A second server took over, telling us he was helping out the first guy and he was very attentive.  The food was good but overpriced.  After I got the bill and put my credit card in the folio, the first server picked up and then stood at the next table chatting with the diners for about 7 minutes before leaving to ring it up.  So 3 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service for a 3 star rating (I'm being generous).  Maybe they just had an off night but there are too many other choices.  I would not go back."

            "review": "I happened to find this amazing restaurant through the help of yelp and I was more than amazed by the overall fine dining experience. I decided to surprise my boyfriend here for our two year anniversary. Despite being a Vegas native, I have never been to the Palms Casino and  thought it was best to make a reservation to Nove Italiano beforehand. This entire process was quick and easy, and they were able to take my request noting that it was my anniversary as well. Once we arrived there, we were welcomed by a hostess which she then directs you to take an elevator. Eerie vibe at first, since the hallway is quite secluded from the rest of the casino. The restaurant is located on the 51st floor of the casino. After reaching the actual restaurant, you are then greeted by another hostess. She led us to our table next to the window and pulled the chair out for both of us. The first thing I noticed was the lovely view that they had overlooking the Strip. Since our reservation was at 8 pm, the lights of the Strip was absolutely breathtaking! After we were seated, we were introduced to our server, Ernest. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us go over the majority of the dishes which I gladly appreciated... since most of the items were in Italian and only had a mere description in English on the ingredients used for that particular dish. Also, another thing to note I would highly recommend asking for the server's recommendations. This will save you lots of time, especially if you have not been to a similar fine dining Italian restaurant, like myself. We had the calamari, walnut tomato pesto ravioli, and rigatoni alla vodka with chicken. The food itself was enjoyable and fulfilling. They also give you complimentary bread to go along with your food. It was now time for dessert. I mentioned to the server about a check in offer for a free dessert (bread pudding) and we ended up ordering the strawberry carpaccio as well, thinking that the bread pudding was not going to make us full. To my surprise, the presentation of the dessert was so cute! They had candles on top and happy anniversary written on the plate with a chocolate syrup/sauce. The bread pudding was to die for!!! It was amazing. By the time we were almost finished with the bread pudding, I was already so stuffed. Still couldn't believe that we had another plate left of dessert. The strawberry carpaccio was average, I strongly believe it was because I was already full and had no more room to actually savor the taste of the carpaccio. But between the two desserts, the bread pudding is the winner here (one of the server's favorites). After we were all done with our food, Ernest offered to take some pictures of my boyfriend and I, which I thought was very sweet of him to do. He took us to a room which had a fireplace and an amazing view of the strip. \n\nI would call Nove Italiano a hidden gem of the Strip. The views were spectacular, the overall atmosphere was classy, and the service was top notch. I would highly recommend for those wanting to spend some extra cash on one amazing dining experience. Thank you again Nove Italiano for making my anniversary much more memorable, would definitely go back! :))"

Both were really, really good.  I honestly think that if the dish has the restaurant's name on it, then more than likely, it has bragging rights.  \n\nNove Italiano is your quintessential club scene Vegas dining. It boasts views of the strip.  The menu is priced accordingly for the kind of restaurant that it is.  The wine list is decent.\n\nDid I mention the spaghetti was really good?  I mean really."

Mike suggested appetizers (try the calamari - best ever!) and Erica suggested reasonably priced Prosecco for a toast.  Other appetizers included two flatbreads and the charcuterie plate - all excellent.  Guests dined on osso bucco, various pastas and fish dishes.  Everyone raved at how good the meal was.  At the end, they brought complementary desserts to all guests.  Highly recommended - menu has all price points and can satisfy even the pickiest eater.  After dinner head up to Playboy Club and enjoy the older gentleman dressed in white dancing to every song.  He was a true delight!"

Nove did everything to accomodate us and provided special and absolutely delicious dishes that were on par with what everyone else was eating as part of the birthday menu. Speaking of the menu, they printed one up for our party. It was a really classy touch that made the evening even more special.\n\nThe food and the view were amazing. The staff was extremely attentive and the experience was superb. The chef came out and talked to the birthday boy and made time to ask the vegans if everything was all right with the food. He even made us a special vegan dessert! \n\nAlso, the drink I had at the bar before dinner (I think it was a strawberry Bellini) was divine.  Overall, everyone who came to the dinner was extremely impressed and pleased. I would definitely recommend Nove for large groups. A+++!"

The food was good, however we were unable to eat most of it because each course was served within 10 minutes of each other, and the waiter took our first course out of the way before we we're done with it! Fine, no big deal, we started with the second course and yet again the main course was served. I told them to leave the food and not take it as we were still working. It felt like we were rushed the entire time. At one point one of our servers tried to take a plate of food away AS MY BOYFRIEND WAS EATING IT. What? Really? So eventually all our food was gone and we were left with some tiny dessert and a $35 tip requirement that was not expected. Oh, and at one point they dropped a bag of to go food on our table. This confused me because 1. We didn't ask for it and 2. The food they did take away from us they stacked on top of each other, so if it had been our food, that is disgusting and dirty. It turned out to be another tables sloppy salami and pizza that was delivered to us. GROSS. We tried telling the manager politely that the service was awful and that realistically tipping the 'required' amount was absurd since we weren't having a great time. She didn't do anything about it and instead threatened to send in security? For what, letting her know that her management was not up to par for such a high scale and expensive restaurant? I left confused and angry and felt cheated. If they had left us alone the whole time and maybe listened when there was confusion I would have given 5 stars. I am really disappointed, Palms."

My girlfriend remarked that she would need to go to McDonald's afterwards for a cheeseburger to fill her up. Oh well, I guess that's what you get at a nice restaurant in Vegas. \n\nThe service:\n*Excellent! Our waiter (I believe his name was Colin) was really great and provided excellent service.

In the beginning we had a rough start as our first waiter didnt try to accomodate my friend who is Vegan and instead insisted in options that she couldnt eat. The night was going downhill fast, I was at the point of wanting to leave and going to another restaurant because of our horrible experience with the waiter. We requested to speak to a manager which is when we spoke to Marques who is the GM and Marlon who is the executive chef. They absolutely saved the night for my friends and I. They displayed the best customer service I have ever received. Marques & Marlon not only rectified the situation but also accomodated my friend's Vegan habits by creating amazing dishes she can also enjoy. They both constantly visited our table to make sure we were having a pleasant experience. I loved the fact that they also gave us an amazing waiter Sladjan who absolutely delightful and hilarious! You cannot beat a beautiful restaurant with jaw dropping views of the strip, delicious classic dishes, and the best of all impeccable customer service.  I  can honestly say that I will recommend Nove to all my family/friends who visit Las Vegas. This will now become my go to Italian restaurant whenever im in town. I know this review is epically long but I had to describe my experience since it started off badly but it ended up perfect. I am so happy that my friends and I gave Nove a second chance and Marques, Marlon & Sladjan  were the reason why we all left with smiles on our faces. To any Vegetarians/Vegans reading this yelp you also can enjoy an amazing meal just make sure you speak to your waiter and Chef Marlon will whip you up something delicious!

I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe table ordered several of the starters such as;  Shrimp Francaise (AMAZING), the Raviolo (Superb), the Bone Marrow (A must try) and Prosciutto di Parma (OUTSTANDING).  All of which were unbelievably prepared.\n\nI was so full from the appetizers I only had room for the BRODO ZUPPE.  It was also amazing.

Not overly dark and romantic at all.  This is the place where the mood of the restaurant feels like its ready to party.\n\n   First, the chef sent out complementary appetizers. To the chef, I thank you! Lobster cakes were buttery, crunchy, and very good. The duck pate was supposedly great according to my friends.  I, on the other hand, never acquired the taste, so I cannot accurately judge them.  Their calamari appetizer was more spicy than what I prefer.  \n\n  Their yellow fin tuna is delicious. Properly seared on the outside, raw inside and fresh on the inside.  With a touch of orange slices and asparagus is complement to the fish.  the side dish of mushrooms were more saltier than I would prefer. It had generous seasoning of everything; ground peppers, mushroom flavors, and excessive salt.   One more thing, the filet mignon is superb.  Its supposedly even better with the balsamic sauce.   Perfectly cooked, tender and flavourful,  I say if the Filet Mignon melts in your mouth without it, then I will welcome the sauce next time I'm here. \n\n  The gin martini was good, but still not perfect.  There's always a fine balance of gin and olive juice, and many bartenders does not hit the right combo.   This guy was close.\n \n  One more thing, you get access to the Palm's Playboy Club for dining here. Very nice!"

            "review": "How often do you get to be a pastry chef for awhile at a nice restaurant? Well I was one tonight.   More on that later.\n\nWe always overlook going to Nove because of its out of the way location so it was on our must try list and was it a good decision.\n\nWe were brought iced teas quickly and they were refilled often during the night.  Then came bread service.  It was three kinds--cheese bread sticks, focaccia, and Italian bread.  We also got a dish with three potential bread toppings and for use during the meal--one container with olive oil, one with red pepper flakes, and one with grated cheese.\n\nOne of the runners brought us an amuse-bouche--two small bruschetta with freshly chopped tomatoes.  A nice palate awakener for what was to come.\n\nFor a starter, we order their salumi plate.  Our server, Alex, assured us it could be shared by two people.  The menu said that it was a selection of cured meats and red pizza.  Well, that sounded fine.  What came was almost a meal in itself.  Four kinds of cured meat, parmigiano cheese, and some fresh ricotta.  That wooden server was placed in front of us and then they placed a wood plate with red pizza.  Wow!  So much!  \n\nCured meat platter:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#rfBs4_87H9DVi5r3o0E_9A\n\nRed Pizza:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#a_Kw4-9-qjX9ROujm1IhHg\n\nWe also had another three compartment dish with mustard, olives, and pickled vegetables.  This was really starting to add up in the stomach and we hadn't gotten to the main course.  Everything was excellent.  We had to let two small pieces of pizza go back with the dishes.\n\nFor the main course, my wife got the Veal Nove which the menu describes as thinly sliced Scaloppine, Prosciutto, Arugula, and Lemon.  I tried a small piece and it was very, very good.  I ordered a special--lobster ravioli with a seafood sauce similar to lobster bisque.  It was superb!  There was a small amount of veal leftover and Alex and his crew quickly boxed it for bringing home.\n\nNow comes my pastry chef experience.  One of their desserts is Make Your Own Cannoli.  You get 5 small sized shells, a small, plastic pastry bag filled with the luscious cream that goes inside the cannoli, and a dish with nine compartments for dipping the ends of the cannoli.  The compartments had raspberry sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, coconut, butterscotch, toffee, pistachio, and chopped peanuts.  If you're counting and only got 8, it's because two of the wells had raspberry syrup.  \n\nTubes and pastry bag:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#sq32kg1eMJezCQzW7W2dTg\n\nDipping dish:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#uKRzAlaK3OKmX0AXS_L4cA\n\nLike my Yelp friends who work at Jean Philippe at Aria, I wielded that pastry bag like a surgeon uses his scalpel.  In no time whatsoever, I had completed my first cannoli with one side dipped in raspberry.\n\nSuccess:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#YFbqugc1i6Yt0wd4ibBihw\n\nMy wife, who hasn't been a fan of cannoli before tonight, ate three of them which left me with just two and I did all the work myself.  That's gratitude I'll tell you.  That dessert was fun and it's a clever menu item!\n\nService was excellent!  Alex and crew were always there to help, removed dirty plates, chat a bit, and do everything as well as they could which was very good!\n\nThe view, while not as good as Aliz\u00e9, is not bad.  I had a view of the original Palms Tower and being a local, I was studying the streets to figure out where the things in the area I know were located.\n\nThis was a very pleasant dinner!  I know I'll be back!  Oh, and I'll be calling Jean Philippe in the morning to check about pastry chef openings."

Soup came out with no spoons. Steaks came out with no steak knives.  When we finally could snag someone to ask for silverware our food was cold, and we were offered zero compensation for our $99/person meals.\n\nManager Brian came to our table when we FINALLY received our check, and we let him know exactly how our experience went.

Great view of the Vegas Strip, especially at night. \n\nThe table bread was three different varieties. My girlfriend and I started off with cocktails; she had a peach bellini and I had a gingery cocktail (forgot name). For appetizers we had the grilled octopi - amazing flavor and texture because they were baby octopi. Both of us got the Nove Spaghetti and it did not disappoint at all. It was a mix of regular spaghetti and squid-ink spaghetti with numerous types of seafood. So good and amazingly portioned. Price? $42 a plate. Ouch. We finished with a Nutella Tower, too sweet, pretty dry, not so great. \n\nI would definitely come back for the Nove Spaghetti. Very high-class, very luxurious restaurant. Wanna do Vegas right?

I was at table by the window with an amazing view of the city.  But the real noteworthy thing is the amazing food.

Dinner was Nove Spaghetti (Scallops, Clams, Shrimp, Calamari with black & white pasta in red sauce) and Penne Ala Vodka with Shrimp.  Both were absolutely divine.  The service was impeccable and the waiter suggested the meatballs as a side which were absolutely the best I've ever had.

Then came the risotto followed by superbly seasoned salmon with spinach, chicken parmesan and gnocchi (salmon was my favorite). The final course was dessert: a chocolate gnash.\n\n It came with 2 small glasses of champage but we ordered the passion fruit mojito from the drink menu (paid extra) which was awesome!

I guess you're paying for location and view.\n\nThe ambiance was certainly beautiful.  Low lighting and leather everywhere that made all of the lights visible on the strip that much more glorious.  The food, however, was not that glorious.\n\nWe got an antipasto platter to start with several meat and cheese options, as well as some olives and nuts.  Overall, it was a pretty good portion for such a fancy restaurant and delicious.  My boyfriend got the filet mignon and it was absolutely delicious.  I got the spaghetti of the night, which included tuna, capers, olives in a red sauce.  I was simply not impressed.  If you're going to claim to be an Italian restaurant, you should probably have good pasta.  Not really the case here.  We also ordered the \"Death by Potatoes\" or something as a side.  It was so heavy that my boyfriend (who typically really enjoys heavy food) couldn't even eat it.  It was greasy and overwhelming and completely didn't go with their Italian theme.  I kind of couldn't understand it.\n\nAdding insult to injury, we ended up paying $30 for two glasses of wine.

Essentially every time we took a drink of water the waiter was right there filling up the glass again. The fact that there was only a couple of tables with guests may have led to this, but it was still annoying. Last but not least, they gave 3 types of bread that was delicious but no butter was given. I dunno, maybe it's just me, I like butter on bread. The view was definitely nice, if you get a table by the windows."

Although most places in Vegas won't let you do a \"Bachelorette\" group dinner unless you have 12 people, Nove accommodated our 11 women and made the dining experience truly special.  50-something floors up from the desert, the first thing that strikes you about Nove is its fantastic view.  Second, the service was extremely friendly and solicitous.  Nove also has a private room, with doors that block the rest of the restaurant's noise, for large groups.  It was a perfectly intimate way to spend Saturday night's dinner with the girls.  We got to choose from the entire menu-- the polenta and rock shrimp contorno/side dish was amazing-- so we could all choose what we liked: appetizers, pastas (they'll serve them in full or half portions and a half is easily generous enough for one person's entree), mains, steaks, and side dishes.  The arugula and beet salad with Humboldt Fog cheese was delicious, as were the \"Sunday dinner\" pasta with sausage, and the gnocchi was how gnocchi is supposed to taste.  It was perfectly formed little pillows of potatoey goodness swimming in tangy tomato sauce.  The wine list was pricey, which I guess fits the theme of Vegas + steak, but we found some good choices with a red Italian blend and a Gavi.  I would highly recommend Nove for a satisfying group dinner out in Vegas!"

Now, I will never return. \nMy first time here was for my boyfriends birthday a few years ago. Since then we had been back for a Chef's tasting with Chef Geno with 15 courses. A few of our favorite dishes included the risotto of the day, Nana's meatballs, chicken Marsala, and the death by potatoes. This was my first and only time dining here since the chef I had grown to love moved on to other ventures. \nI still had faith that Nove would be a great place without Chef Geno. The menu was almost the same. The crowd wasn't. The waiter even mentioned when we asked, that the new chef was \"completely different\". Not bad, just not the same. \nWell I think he was being polite. The exact same chicken Marsala dish looked the same but tasted totally different. The meatballs and potatoes were still decent. The gnocchi was too mushy. And the risotto, oh I wouldn't know as they offered it as the special, and then ran out. I waited 20 minutes and ate my entire appetizer before my drink arrived. And there was no new chef coming out to check on us, see how we liked the food, or introduce himself. This always happened in past times when Nove was not busy. Considering we were there late, and the Chef was in view- it could have happened. \nMaybe my expectations were set too high, but I have had totally different experiences in the past. All of them made me feel great about spending $150-300 for dinner for 2. \nRight now I am thankful I had a discount on my tickets from the Lisa Lampanelli show, because I would have been mad to pay full price last night. \nI really hope N9NE group and Nove figure out a way to put the pieces back together. Chef Geno, we miss you!!"

Surely, that adds to the ambience if it's the type of loud, party scene characteristic of the Palms, but it makes dinner conversation difficult at the least.  I certainly wouldn't go here for an intimate dinner.\n\nThe decor, however, was dark, modern, trendy and we liked it.  And the views of Vegas were fantastic.\n\nWe couldn't decide whether the service was excellent or horrible, and that's not a good dilemma.  On the one hand, the waiter changed our table from upstairs to downstairs when we asked.  (Upstairs was deserted when we were escorted to our table around 7:30 p.m., too early, I suppose).  The wait staff was also attentive and responsive.\n\nThe problem was all the blunders made throughout the evening.\n\nFirst, one friend is allergic to shellfish, and, despite her explicit request that a particular dish not be served with shellfish, it arrived with shellfish.  Next, it took forever for her dish to be replaced.  Granted, the waiter offered her an extra dish of pasta and an extra appetizer while she waited, but the wait was still exceedingly long.  The rest of us were finished with our entrees by the time her dish arrived.  The waiter also made good by giving us two deserts on the house, but the damage was done by then.\n\nSecond, another friend SAT ON GUM on his seat.  The waiter explained that the gum couldn't have been on the seat, because they clean the booths after each set of diners; therefore, he concluded it must have fallen from . . . the bottom of the table.  Yuck!\n\nThird, we asked the waiter about a particular wine, and the waiter gave us a completely incorrect description of it.  When we later asked the sommelier, the sommelier flatly contradicted the waiter's description, describing the wine correctly.  But this means, meanwhile, we were stuck with an expensive bottle of wine that didn't suit.\n\nThe food itself was good, but the mistakes were distractions throughout the evening from which the meal could not recover."

The views don't quite compare to Aliz\u00e9 as you are facing West towards the mountains and not the strip.  Part of the views are also blocked by the Palms Casino tour which takes away from the experience.\n\nWe came as a group of four and decided to order our entrees individually but shared everything as a table.  They started us off with bread and an amuse bouch\u00e9 which was nice.  I can't recall what it was but it certainly wasn't one of my favorites.  Our appetizer was the calamari which were lauded as the best ever by the waiter.  He was pretty close.  These were pretty damn good.  We then ordered a side of \"Death by Potatoes\", a side of meatballs, bolognese, scallop risotto, seafood spaghetti, and ravioli.  Everything was absolutely delicious except for the \"Death by Potatoes\".  This side is overhyped in my opinion as they just tasted like another batch of mashed potatoes.  The dish that everyone enjoyed most was the risotto and scallops.  Highly recommended!\n\nOur service was really good throughout the entire night from start to finish.  We ended up staying later than close and were never pressured to leave as well.

The bar is connected to the dining room so it can get very loud at times.  The service is average as our courses from the set menu came out very slow.  The palms used to be the happenings lace but given the large sign outfront now says \"$10 blackjack all day\" I'm not sure that is the case.  Anyway...a good dinner but just know what your getting into."

            "review": "Came to Nove after months of wanting to check it out.. we came specifically for appetizers and drinks at the bar/lounge and were very happy with this place! After trying Simon at Palms Place and being disappointed I was really hoping Nove would live up to my expectations of the hype. Marcus was our bartender as well as another sweet girl whose name I do not recall. We got some sort of shrimp salad appetizer (the artichoke hearts in it were DELICIOUS) and the shrimp was flavorful and cooked well, in addition we got some of their rendition of fries which were reminiscent of the ones my mom makes from scratch at home but, mom still does it better. The sauce was kind of weird and too cold of a contrast in my opinion. The chef also sent out a small plate of two different kind of crostini type appetizers, the bean one was interesting but salty and the sweeter of the pair was sumptuous. I had a pomegranate type martini off the specialty menu and was thoroughly buzzing after that.. well balanced flavor and a nice texture. We also were spoiled with a complementary spicy shot (Can't recall the name but went down so smooth and had a nice tingle after from the marinated 5 pepper tequila.. ask to see the ones they're marinating, so cool!!) and we enjoyed an espresso martini which was beyond delicious! Marcus is an amazing bartender/server and knows his craft!! Totally coming back to Nove Italiano.. hopefully Adrienne Maloof is there next time ;)"

We also had the \"death by potatoes\" which were great! Really is death by butter though, looks like Paula Dean made them. The waiter and his helper were very helpful and friendly. Always bringing drinks and asking if we needed anything. We were so dull we didn't order dessert, but they brought us a little dessert plate that said \"happy anniversary\" with some delicious mini desserts! Would definitely return. Tip: we went up to ghost bar after and it was happy hour. 2 drinks(one speciality mixed with Ciroq and one with Jack Daniels) for $13.50. I couldn't believe it!!"

While in Vegas for the weekend, my BF and I decided to try Nove Italiano mainly bc we wanted a restaurant with a nice atmosphere and a nice view.\nWe figured, \"OK Italian, it will probably be pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary\"\nWere we wrong.\nThis food was unbelievable.\n\nIn the beginning they bring you an assortment of fresh breads and breadsticks with a little tray on the side with Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes and Parmesan Cheese for dipping. \nI dont usually partake in bread, but I did try a thin breadstick with the dippings and it was really good.\n\nAfter reading about the Grilled Octopus App on yelp, I figured we had to try it.   Let me tell you, it was amazing.   Obviously not for everyone bc its octopus, but it was so tender and the flavor of the marinade was simple but very very fresh and a great flavor.  They were grilled so they were crispy.  Like nothing I have ever had before.\nThe marinade was not too heavy, more like a ton of fresh herbs.\n\nI had the White Pizza with Clams.\nVery simple but amazing.\nExtremely thin crust so you can eat it and not feel full or guilty.  And big clams and plenty of them on top.\n\nMy BF got the Chicken Marsala.   It was on the bone which at first seemed weird, but he said he loved it bc it fell off the bone.\nHuge gourmet mushrooms and plenty of them.\nOn the side he had penne pasta in Alfredo sauce which he loved. It looked like it was fresh-made sauce and a bit lighter then what you would expect alfredo to be.\n\nWe got a side of the Aparagus special dish, which was Grilled Asparagus with an egg and Ricotta cheese.\nSounds totally weird, I know, but so great!!\n\nThe place is also swanky and upscale but comfortable, the view is great.\n\nOverall this place is a Must when in Vegas.\nAnd the price ,we thought, was very fair.  We more than enough food, and 1 glass of wine and a Diet Coke and the bill was $125 with tip.     Not bad at all for a fine restaurant in Vegas."

Since we were staying at Palms Place we thought we'd try NOVE. OMG...who designed that place?! Being an opera singer I would love to sing in that place when it's empty but as a customer it was awful being able to hear EVERYONE! I have never in my life been in such a loud restaurant. We thought it was because of a large party in the main room but even when we moved and the people left I could hear everyone like they were sitting right next to me. I had a huge headache the whole time. On top of that our waiter was kinda a douche and didn't even really pay attention to us. I asked for a TASTE of the Pinot noir to see if I liked it and he just brought me a whole glass like it was what I ordered. He really didn't seem to give a crap.\n\nAs far as the food was concerned the beef tartar was fantastic! The amuse Bouche that came out before was really boring and sort of flavorless (some sort of bruschetta). I ordered the side dish of gnocchi as my entree...it was bigger than my bfs entree! It was also really good the next evening. However, aside from the beef tartar none of the food was very memorable. My boyfriend said the pizza was really good but being sorta a pizza snob I just thought it was decent but nothing fantastic.\n\nFood-3 stars\nService-0.5\n\nI wouldn't waste my money on NOVE again when there are so many good restaurants in Vegas with servers who actually give a crap and food that will really blow my mind. My advice...head to Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan."

We start with the crudo and order two because it's too good to share. They offer a slight variation on it each night but it always features fresh sashimi assortment with olive oil, sea salt, and some kind of fruit. We then move to the caprese salad and substitute burrata for the buffalo mozzarella...a delicious decision! Each evening, they have brought out at least one appetizer or feature compliments of the house and they are incredibly accommodating to repeat customers. For our entree, we split a butterflied 8oz filet mignon prepared medium well (they slightly undertook so this leaves the center with just a touch of pink) We tried the Parmesan preparation but prefer the untouched version...we still have to try the much raved about house balsamic. We order the death by potatoes sans meat and either brocolini or spinach, both delicious. In addition to the delicious food, we order the passionfruit mojito...yum! We neve order dessert but when they brought out their strawberry carpaccio to our table, we cleaned that plate too...a light and scrumptious end to a satisfying meal.\n\nPros: service, consistency, management, food, & ambiance\n\nCons: none yet;)!"

Admittedly I was a bit surprised.  The restaurant is high up on one of the towers of the Palms, and has great views of the Strip and the city, so that was a good start.  The food was all pretty good.  I had ravioli, but I tried items that my friends ordered, including tortelini, sea bass, and bone-in fillet steak.  Everything was really tasty here, and so my mediocre expectation was shattered.  It was still a bit overpriced, with dishes running from $25-45, but I was satisfied with the meal.

I coordinated through Kelly Maxwell for special/ group events and she did such a good job meeting our needs & requests. We had an AWESOME view of the Las Vegas strip which was kinda trippy cuz you see Vegas but while you're in the restaurant you feel like you're in a Venetian Garden in Italy. I guess that's why they call it the Garden Room. The room also has gold framed mirrors that are TVs for a/v purposes. Perfect for a slideshow! (FYI- if you book a group dinner of 12 or more you & your guests get free admission to Ghostbar but get there early!) \nOkay, first thing's first. The food was ON POINT.  I'd say for a huge group we did it right by ordering our food family style and got all of the chef's best. (That guy, Chef Marlon, surely knows his craft and treats his guests like family. He came out to see our group periodically through the night and he even carried the celebrant's birthday cake out and sang happy birthday to him. I mean, who does that?!? That's what you call amazing service and passion for what you do. I mean you could taste the love in his food lol. So.. We HAD to get a picture with him! His picture is all over the strip and even on screens in cabs, how could you not?!)\nSo, for appetizers we ordered beef carpaccio, prosciutto Di Parma, shrimp francaise & federal hill calamari with complementary nana's meatballs. All was delish. Calamari was best I ever had! \nAs for the entrees --the guest of honor had a surf n' turf (lobster tail, filet mignon, death by potatoes and asparagus) all to himself but I got to try it. It tasted just as good as it looked! The rest of us had the veal Milanese , NY steak, sliced capunti bolognese, grilled asparagus and death by potatoes (OMG... unforgettable!). It was a gastronomic experience! Our palettes were full of various but complementing flavors. We were so full by this point it's a good thing they were shared plates. But that's how you know the food is good cuz u just keep eating even though ur full! To top it off, the dessert was also a hit. The birthday boy got a Tiramisu cake and we all had cannolis with lemon mascarpone. I'm full just thinking of all the food we had! \nSo overall, we had an unforgettable experience at Nov\u00e9. I'd like to thank the staff that served us and making this a special one to remember. I hope I get everyone's names right- General Mgr Marques, the servers and Beatriz and our hostess Lea Jane. Last but not least, Chef Marlon you out did yourself! Thanks again for delivering #TheMarlonExperience !! I'll be coming back the next time I come to Vegas =)"

While I do not feel that Nove Italiano is completely overrated, I can honestly say I expected a little more.  It was good-- very good --even! But for $$$$, I was expecting one of the best Italian meals I've ever had. Alas, it can't compare to some of the Italian food I've had in North Beach (SF) or even my favorite Italian place in my hood, where the chef is from Italy and imports ingredients from there daily. Not to knock Nove though...\n\nThe best part of the meal was the amuse bouche - mushroom bruschetta on crostini and fried polenta. The waiter brought it to us on the house, which apparently we downed all too quickly, so they brought us another round (on accident). We also ordered the Burrata, one of my favorite antipasto dishes, with prosciutto and beets. For an entree, I ordered the rigatoni bolognese, which I realize is not the most 'exotic' Italian dish -- but keep in mind this was a meal before a night of knocking back booze until the wee hours of the morning. Otherwise I would have ordered the Ribeye (I am a steak girl, through and through). Our waiter did say that the restaurant was known for its steaks, so maybe this is what resulted in a 3 star experience. Definitely not bad, and I would even say memorable -- but part of me says that because of the bright pink chandeliers and awesome views. It was overall, a very nice dinner with my best girls! \n\n*One more note: bartender, please learn how to make a proper lychee martini! I had lychee vodka mixed with other fruit juices -- resulting in a lychee/lemon drop flavor. Awkward."

As for the atmosphere, in spite of the lovely views from the floor-to-ceiling windows, the place somehow came across like a fancy coffee shop - the  tables and the booths just didn't work.  \n\nThe restaurant also was dark - but not dark/romantic like so many charming Italian places,  just dark.\n\nThe wait staff was good - while it's true that they removed plates from my buddy  before everyone (me) was finished that is not uncommon in the U.S., so I will overlook it.\n\nMy friend had a steak - he thought it was very good. I had the Spaghetti nove (seafood) with some kind of dark spaghetti mixed in - also good and the spaghetti done al dente as it should be. But frankly not outstanding.\n\nWe had a bottle of wine - a good Merlot (no, not an oxymoron) that should have been $40-50 but was $125 - well it's Vegas.\n\nUpon departure they had to call the elevator from the lobby (the buttons were disabled) and it took a full 10 minutes.\n\nDinner for 2 including tax/tip/wine was $350. Pasta Mia down the block in a strip mall is better at 1/4 the price.\n\nAnd it was empty at 7:30PM on a Friday night. Evidently I am not the only person disappointed.\n\nFrankly it's a shame - this place could be great. Maybe Nove Italiano just needs a new manager."

Steaks and chops were good and perfectly cooked.  The best thing by far however, was a generously-sized $10 side of gnocchi laden with all kinds of baby vegetables: squash, artichokes, etc.  That was by far the highlight of the meal and would've been all I needed!  So look for these hidden gems and you'll do well here. \n\nSome good wine choices by the glass.\n\nFor some reason the restaurants at The Palms have chronic problems with service.  It's not that it's bad...it's just so uneven and the very basic, Restaurant 101 stuff is lacking.  So while my server was certainly friendly and had good suggestions, water glasses were not refilled, or water was spilled on the table and never cleaned up, or empty plates stayed on the table forever without being bussed, a mess of (very mediocre) bread and bread sticks were plopped down on the table looking like they could've been the previous diners' leftovers.\n\nAlso, since it shares and elevator with the Playboy Club and Moon nightclub, be prepared for militaristic treatment: seriously, we were literally marched to the elevator...and velvet-rope fighting just to get to the hostess.  This part of the process while acceptable for a club is really an unacceptable start if you're trying for a relaxing dining experience."

We started with the Littleneck clam pizza.  I liked the pizza but the clams were a bit chewy--not melt-in-your mouth as I was hoping for.  The bread service is good--cheese bread, crispy parmesan sticks, and rosemary focaccia.  My husband had the chicken marsala (bone-in double breast) with a good amount of mushrooms.  He liked it.  I tried it and thought it was dry.  I had the osso bucco cannelloni which had amazing flavor and was a large portion.  The cannelloni pasta was very good.  However, there was a lot of osso bucco fat which had a discernible texture from the meat and I had to periodically spit it out (I know gross--but I have a thing for not eating chunks of fat--I just can't do it).  We were too full to attempt dessert and ended the evening at that."

It may be off the strip but it is WELL worth the drive or $15 cab ride to get there!\n\nThis review is ridiculously overdue but I really wanted to leave one since the food and service here was BEYOND amazing!\n\nEveryone here from our server, Sladjan to the manager, to Chef Marlon himself was absolutely a delight to be around.\n\nThe Food, oh my goodness, the food! We were so satisfied with every course we just kept eating despite being ridiculously full!\n\nWe started with the amuse bouche of a fried almost risotto ball (amazing!) followed by an appetizer for each of us. I got the lobster bisque (soo good! Creamy with just a little punch of spice but nothing too overpowering) and one of the special of the day's salads (delicious!). After that was our \"special scallop dish\" (THANK YOU CHEF MARLON!) Oh My Gawsh! I have never had a more perfectly cooked scallop and all the sauces on that plate were just one amazing flavor after another. After that we each had an entree, I had the special seafood and squid ink spaghetti and my friend had the lamb. By now we are STUPID full but we couldn't stop eating just because everything was soooo good!\n\nAnd then finally was dessert, we weren't sure what we wanted or even if we wanted anything since we couldn't even finish our entrees (Which BTW, we totally took with us TO GO even though we were heading over to GhostBar right after dinner. Didn't care, was going to find a way to get those meals home to eat the next day...or well at 2 am after the club haha). But Chef Marlon and Sladjan had one more surprise for us, a coffee dessert! Now, I don't like coffee. I don't drink it since I don't like the taste or smell but this was AMAZING! I totally ate it despite feeling full and it was so good! So thanks for that, I am now forever ruined with coffee since nothing will ever taste as good as that expresso shot at the bottom.\n\nNow just an editors note here: I had this meal back in the end of May...it's now the end of July and I can still remember what I ate (for the most part) and what it tasted like...THAT's how GOOD everything was!\n\nOverall, if I could give more than 5 stars I would. I will definitely be back EVERY time I visit Las Vegas! Thank you so much to the entire staff of Nove and to Chef Marlon! This was the most amazing experience of my Las Vegas trip! Hope to see you guys again really soon! :D"

My sister, father, and I chose NOVE as our dinner of choice on the last day of restaurant week. I must say. I was quite impressed.\n\nFor the first course we all chose the MAIN LOBSTER BRODO: It was a Lobster Tortellini, creme fraiche, and chives. The creme fraiche had a very nice and strong flavor to it. It was tart and tasted a lot like a lobster bisque. The tortellini was awesome! They give you two light pieces that look like a steamed dumpling. It was very light and refreshing. The pasta was not heavy and it really dissolved in your mouth.\n\nSecond course I had the FENNEL APPLE SALAD and my dad had the PETITE FARMERS MARKET GREENS. My first time having fennel and although it will probably be the way eat way to experience fennel I just learned that this salad is not my favorite. The fennel had that strong liquorish taste and I'm not too fond of liquorish. With the apple and the light dressing it really toned the taste down, but it created a dry texture. I liked the Farmers Market Salad more. It was classic with spring mixes and goat cheese. I would just remove the beets.\n\nMain course I had the AIRLINE CHICKEN BREAST. The chicken was very tender but it really just tastes like BBQ chicken to me. I actually enjoyed my dad's salmon. It had that nice lemony taste, tender, and the roasted almond's smoke taste made for a great addition to the dish! This is all way before my dad decided to drown the salmon with Tabasco sauce.\n\nFor dessert we had a CHOCOLATE GANACHE ON TOAST. It was actually pretty delicious! A nice rich chocolate spread with season sea salt I top made a great combination of that saltiness and sweetness. \n\nAlso, big thumbs up to Chef Geno and the crew for giving us window seating and a complimentary dessert sampler. If you're looking for a nice upscale chic place to dine I would surely recommend this place. They offer a great happy hour menu that is only served at the bar, and the food is surely just as good as the interior decor."

This dish did not meet my expectations because it was very short on seafood. Considering the price it could have been better executed. The Caprese Salad is a little different than most in that it is made with roasted tomatoes. I expected the tomatoes to be warm but it was totally a cold dish. A very tasty version of an old standby. The Filet Mignon was tender and cooked as requested. We shared the Death by Potatoes which was more than enough for two people. The menu does not explain the potato dish but it is mashed potatoes with crispy pancetta and truffle oil. Wine by the glass was priced reasonably. \nFor desert I recommend the Cannoli Plate.

Atmosphere is classy and could be a nice romantic dinner location.  Cuisine is high end American and Italian.  They offer a really great wine list.  The bar was very cool and provided cocktails that delivered.  I was with a large business party.  We had some tasty bread and appetizers.  All the entrees were very good although one of my my companions had the NY Strip and it was average at best.  Service was very attentive and perfect.  Prices were what you would expect and and value was delivered for this higher end place.  I would do Nove again and recommend it ... especially if you are staying at the Palms or there for a visit.  However, there are so many fantastic places in Vegas I might not seek it out again - unless I was in area or planning to be."

There was a delicious array of food and plenty of it!   A starter, salad, pizza, meatball, shrimp, a choice of main course, and finally cheesecake for dessert.  I great deal for $55 and it even includes unlimited white and red wine, both of which were delicious.\n\nThe restaurant has an excellent view, about 50 stories above the strip in the Palms Fantasy Tower.  We found the service to be excellent!  Our servers were Jerry and Luis.  Even the manager, Jessica and the Chef Geno stopped by our table to ask about our experience.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night on New Year's Eve weekend, however we felt the service we received was exceptional.\n\nThis is definitely a place to visit, just off the strip, an amazing view, stylish interior, excellent meal, great value on the price fix menu, and superb service."

The housemade tortollenis were cooked perfectly and were very savory. The Ahi tuna was also cooked to perfection..\nI am still dreaming about our dessert. A nuttella cake... wow...\nService was impeccable and the ambiance just delightful. \nGo and try it.. you won't regret it.. and then go upstairs to the Playboy club or Moon and enjoy the rest of the night !"

            "review": "i was underwhelmed. i guess this is one of the scene-y places to eat in vegas. they create the exclusivity allure by positioning a bunch of 14 year olds in corsets in the lobby of the palms to escort you to a special elevator that takes you up to the restaurant. then you are greeted by 16 year olds in corsets who tell you sweetly that they are running about 20 min late so you can drink in the bar till your table is ready. where teh 18 year olds will serveyou alcohol and roll their eyes when you ask them why there is a pizza martini on their menu. \n\nit definitely was a scene, my dress was about a 11 inches too long for this place. but i ordered a glass of champagne and decided to go with it. but then my bubbly arrived and it was horribly, disgustingly sweet. when i told the 18 year old waitress this she just looked at me and said, \"it's supposed to be sweet, it's a moscato\". (eye roll)\n\nnow listen honey, i am from SF. i've been to wine country like 40 million times. and when you only have 2 champagnes by the glass on your menu and one is $40 a glass henriot and the only other option is $11 you don't make that $11 option a horrible moscato. at least roll with prosecco. yes, i realize a moscato is supossed to be sweet, but this just tasted like it was about $5.99 a bottle sweet. there's a difference.  \n\nanyway, after waiting the extra 20 min after our reservation time we were seated. service from there was pretty good. but the food was just ok. i had linguine with clams, the meal i would choose if it were my last meal on earth. i asked for it with white wine sauce. it came out in a pool of butter. seriously. i get that the rest of america is grossly overweight and that these people love vegas, but come on. i could only eat about a quarter of it. the husband's chicken marsala was quite good, if a bit salty, and our friend's halibut was cooked well but covered with a pretty mediocre tomato sauce. \n\ni don't even know if telling you to go elsewhere would help cause most of the food in vegas seemed a bit overrated and overpriced. \n\non another note--the decor in here was just not working for me. some elements were very cool, but overall it was a disjointed design attempt. otstentacious and even a little tacky. but then, it's vegas. so i guess what the hell."

Service over the phone was polite and there seemed to be no issues or any unavailability.\n\nWe get to the host table located downstairs and they didn't have my reservation. We were still seated but we didn't get a window seat and they weren't aware that it was a birthday celebration. At that point I was just a smidge irritated so I didn't even mention anything when I probably should've due to an available window seat the entire time we were there. Just the point of the fact that this is why I call ahead of time and make a reservation.\n\nBesides that, service was great. Food was great (huge portions) and a nice lounge-like atmosphere. Not huge, wasn't over crowded. Will possibly be back but not somewhere I'm dying to go back to. A-OK"

I have to say that the service was 5 stars. It almost bordered on too much service. We never felt rushed but we had a few people helping us rather than one waiter. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice and we were seated over in a corner more which was nice because we could talk a little more freely. It gets pretty loud in there if it is busy which it was that night. \n\nI ordered the Nove spaghetti which was really good but not spectacular. I have had better dishes when it comes to remembering the food. It had a ton of fish and it was fresh. The scallops were awesome though. No complaints but not the best I have ever had. Close though. \n\nMy boss got the heirloom tomato salad and he said that was really good. He also got the black bass which he said it was good BUT here is where one star comes off. It was served whole which is OK but they did not fillet it or anything so there were bones in every bite. He finally had to ask the waiter to fillet it but it didn't really help. His quote was \" the taste is great but if I am paying this much I don't want to work this hard for my meal\" \n\nOverall great dinner and good service. The wine selection is also pretty killer."

What was supposed to be a $320 meal for two, was nothing more than a Fridays/Applebees happy hour special.  Two glasses of garbage champagne, followed by cold/cool Calamari and a side of 4 pieces of pepperoni and salami.  Then comes the Salmon (avg at best), and the Chicken parmesan (exactly equivilant to Burger Kings).  The chicken was a superthin piece of formerly frozen chicken.  tough, chewy, horrible...and not even hot.  HORRIBLE.  we didnt even eat the desert.\n\nWe had a bottle of Fiji, a domestic beer, and a $16 glass of wine.  Waiter returns with a $172 bill (after my travelzoo voucher).  not sure if he was trying to con us or not, as the bill showed a $2xx travelzoo discount on it.  He said \"oh, no no, thats fine, just deduct that $99 from the bill and thats what we charge, this is just how the receipt is done\".  Yea..whatever guy.  So, we were charged the tax on the full $320, and gratuity was also fully added on the $320 (even tho we saw our waiter twice), plus the $9 bottle of Fiji water.  \n\nIn the end, it cost me a total of $171 (voucher included), to eat what would have cost about $25 at a Fridays or Applebees happy hour.  And to be completely honest....it would have been better at either of those joints.  Absolutely unreal that they would do this, even as a revenue booster in a bad economy.  The food does not represent their establishment in the least (id really hope not!), and for someone who did well at the casino, I would have been interested in going back to have it again (if its all that people says its cracked up to be on the regular menu).  But we'll never know.  And have NO intention of ever finding out.  \n\nLeft with a bad taste in our mouths...both figuratively and literally.  \n\none star is too much."

We bought the 4 course dinner option. We were given a basket of different breads to start, they were good. Then the first course, salad with pine-nuts, it was simple & okay .Then came out  the bowls of rigatoni, also okay.\n\n As for our main course,  I  had the salmon plate which was delicious, it had almost a buttery consistency, probably the best I've had) and my friend had the flank steak which was also great. Last but not least, dessert, black berry cheese cake which looked beautiful & was also delicious, that we shared. \n\nI left feeling so full! Our waiter even gave us a free pass to the ghostbar afterwards The whole dining experience was awesome couldn't have been happier, the waitstaff top-notch, the main courses, & desert delicious.

There were four of us, and we arrived we were forced to wait which was rather confusing because the restaurant was pretty empty.  Anyway, we only had to wait for about 10 minutes, so no big deal. Except, because the place was pretty empty we thought we'd get a good table with a view.  Not so much.  We got a booth facing the middle of the place.  whatever, no problem,  the view wasn't that important to us.  \n\nI forget our waiter's name but he was really helpful and a funny dude.  He helped us pick a bottle of wine ( I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty cheap and really good).  For aps, we ordered Crudo (kinda like a sashimi dish) , Arancino (rissotto ball),  crab cakes.  We had one more, but I forget what it was, prob a seafood dish.  Everbody really liked their aps, and my Arancino was fantastic.  We also ordered a bowl of Sunday Gravy (pasta, meatballs) for everyone to split.  The waiter was really cool and told us we only need half of it, and gave us a half portion, and everyone loved the Sunday Gravy.  Even the half portion was huge.  Oh, I forgot, the breads they served us before the aps were really good too.   \n\nOn to the dinners, I was kind of boring and got the chicken parm.  It was the best chicken parm Ive ever had in my life, hands down.  The portion was also HUGE!.  I also had the garlic mashed potatoes which were good, a lil on the strong side. I felt horrible throwing it out, because it was just that good.  My friend ordered their specialty, the osso bucco, which was perfect.\n\nWe def ordered way too much food, and realized we could have probably eaten here for very cheap.  As some other reviewers stated, you get to go to the playboy club/moon for free afterwards, which is nice.  Overall, this place compares to the top italian rest in NYC, and I think came out to about $90/person with wine and probably about twice as much food as we actually needed.  I recommend Nove to anyone I know that is going to Vegas.  Great for couples or groups of friends, probably not children.  \n\nNove was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the whole situation at the beginning."

            "review": "Overall, a good meal.  Food was quite good and menu was well varied in options and choices.  Waiter service was hit or miss.  Hostess stand service was friendly, but needed some improvement.  Design of restaurant on 51st floor was a missed opportunity.  Value about average.  See details below.\n\nHostess Stand - 2.5/5:  Had 6:45pm reservation, arrived at 6:40pm.  Table was not ready, invited to sit at the bar and order a drink (where we ordered a bottle of wine.)  Table was not ready until 7:20pm.  Should have been offered a cocktail for table being ready 35 minutes after reservation, but was not.\n\nService at table - 2.5/5:  Main waiter was somewhat hard to find and a bit aloof (the restaurant is fairly poorly designed which contributed to this, more on that later), asked to see regular menu and price fix menu, was told that price fixe no longer available (which I do not believe to be the case).  One item ordered was never delivered (and did not show up on the bill - so perhaps a lack of attention here). Food servers and busboys were quite good, somewhat made up for main waiter issues.\n\nFood - 4/5:  Quality of food was quite good.  Bread service with oil, parmagianno and pepper flake was good, caesar salads were good, fresh, properly prepared/dressed, arancini were good, ordered the short rib ravioli, quite good, although a little light on the portion, also ordered sunday gravy pasta, excellent, high quality, generous portion, death by potatoes ordered but never served.  Wine list was extensive with some reasonable options.\n\nDesign/Ambience - 2/5:  Nice interiors, but many fatal flaws.  Did not take advantage of location on the 51st floor of Palm's Fantasy tower, perimeter banquettes face towards the interior, not the view outside, interior tables do not get good view due to being blocked by banquettes.  Sat at banquette side by side with wife (which was ok, but did not allow us to easily face each other while talking) and we looked at interior/bar, no view outside.  Also, they put flat screens on windows looking outside - very odd decision, distracts/blocks view.  Bar has best view as it is raised, but is most distant from view.  Missed opportunity by designers and owner - this restaurant could be on the first floor of the hotel and it would not miss the 51st floor location.  Kitchen is far down a hall - leads to delayed service and likely exhausted wait staff.  Music too loud for conversation.  Very mixed crowd - familiies, couples, military, clubbers with very little clothing, party groups, etc...\n\nPrice - Prices were about right based on 'high-end' status of restaurant.  Wine list has some good options, many items quite expensive.  Noted several people bring own wine (odd for this type of restaurant) - not sure of corkage fees.  Liked the menu structure - could eat a multi-course meal, or more tasting style - many options here.\n\nOverall Value - 3/5:  Based on high-end status - would rank about average here.  If this were a neighborhood or casino restaurant not on the 51st floor of a hotel tower, with a slightly lower price point and the same food, value would rank a 4/5."

No, the Palms is a place to go if you are young and think the Real World Las Vegas was a \"classic\" TV show.  Nove actually changes the model though - it's the best place to eat in the resort, and it's one of my favorite choices in Vegas (all things considered).\n\nThe atmosphere is great - you're higher than the famed Ghostbar with views of Vegas and the suburbs all around.  It's connected to the Playboy Club and Moon (separate cover required), so it's a one-stop destination for a group ready to party.\n\nThe staff is attentive, friendly, and personable.  You can ask questions without feeling stupid or out of place, although anytime I talk to women that pretty, I tend to blush anyway... I'm shy!\n\nBut the food is really enjoyable.  It's not the fanciest place in town, but it's a better bargain than some of the more famous restaurants, it's easier to get a reservation (you can always eat at the bar, too), and they serve healthy portions.  A little on the pricey side, but not as outrageous as other places in town - after all, this is Vegas!\n\nThe guys will like the outfits the female staff wear, plus the great food.

Its jumbo shrimp sliced in half egg battered   sauteed with garlic, white wine , butter and lemon. Remind you i was there for a cocktail only  but i couldn't stop eating . I  asked the bartender what  does the Chef recommend for dinner and Bellinda  said the salmon wich I told her to have the chef cook it  to its liking and it was also phenomenal flaky but not dry overdone.

Small breads and bread sticks with oil, grated cheese, and pepper flakes before meals (complimentary) were tasty! We split the navo speciality pasta and the gnocchi, yum! Very romantic ambiance, but also great, large tables for groups! Great place."

They offer $30.00 for an all you can eat buffet with exquisite selection of food. Large prawns,  muscles, pastas, salads and desserts! You can also have bottle service with your food, DJ spinning and a sunny view of the city from high above. \n\nEveryone is dancing, eating, drinking and having a great time! It was fun to watch and even a better time eating!"

Came last night for my girlfriend of 8 yrs, 23rd birthday and when I made reservations over the phone I asked for a seat right by a window and when I got there the lady explained to the waiter \"in code\" that I wanted a window seat.. And I thought wow how did they know I didn't want her to know I wanted to be seated by a window because it was a surprise? It was perfect from chicken parmigiana to the great service.. Cloth napkins laid across our laps so no food will spill makes you feel really upscale. And the customer service makes you feel comfortable, waiter never takes to long to ask if you need anything else.. This place is life I'm definitely a fan and it's prices are fair too, happy hour on Thursday so that's another reason. My waiter was Beatriz really prompt and polite I told her it was my gf's birthday and I can tell she was used to have birthdays on the count of her good service:)"

It had some sort of spicy sauce to it that gave it some kick.  Freaking good.  And the portion was pretty large.\n\nWithin in our party we ordered the Barramundi, the lamb chops, and the veal.  The veal was so tender and melted in your mouth.  Same with the lamb.  It was amazing.  The Barramundi was served whole (which I was aware), however I am accustomed to having the bones taken out before it is served or at the table, and that did not happen.  So though the flavor was so delicate and wonderful, it sucked having to eat around the bones. \n\nThe sides we ordered were the gnuddi and the mashed potatos.  And my best friend and I split the panzanella salad.The salad was so wonderful.  The big pieces of pancetta made the salad. The gnuddi were so melt-in-your-mouth that words would never do it justice.  And yes, the mashed potatoes were silky and creamy.   We had leftovers...\n\nThe food was fantastic.  The service was impeccable.  And the ambiance was just what I wanted.  I will note, that we were in the back of the room where it isn't as loud as the main dining area.\n\nDefinitely hit this place up."

In fact I give 5 stars for service, drinks, food, and atmosphere. Our party of 6 were treated like royalty (we aren't royalty).  The chef came out and offered a wonderful appetizer on the house. The manager offered our after dinner drinks. The best martini I've ever had. The food was exceptional, I had the short rib over saffron risotto with a side of meatballs, something called a bread salad to start. Flavors were in abundance. As others have said, the view is the best in Vegas as you can see from the Mandalay all the way to downtown. Not many people in the place and I cannot figure out why.  If you want Italian there is no other place to go here. I like it so much that if you go I'd love to hear how you liked it."

This was $400 for three drinks, three salads, two sides, three entrees, and three desserts.  Oh, and they charged us $2.95 for an extra plate of bread and brought out four pieces.  What?

How could I have been missing out on something so great? \n\nAs soon as we sat down our amazing server came over to greet us. I handed him the Groupons and he was actually happy that we had them. As he was telling us about the choices that came along with the Groupon, we were served with a nice chilled glass of Prosseco. We all gave him our choices and he said the food would be right out. Boy was he right. \n\nThe Appetizer we all chose was the Federal Hill Calamari. Do not miss out on this if you go here. This has to be hands down the best calamari I have ever had. It was so good and spicy, full of peppercinis. It did not even need sauce.\n\nOur salads were next and we all chose the Caesar's Salad. It was delicious and I actually would have enjoyed another if I could have gotten my hands on one.\n\nWe all ordered the same entree which was the Rigatoni Bolognese. Holy smokes, the bowl that came out was a huge portion. Everyone at the table enjoyed it so much. I just kept stuffing my face not wanting to waste any part of it. Probably one of the best I have tasted. \n\nThe dessert was 3 scoops of gelato ( chocolate, caramel, and vanilla) with 2 little cookies on the side. Oh my was this gelato good. We were licking the bowls.\n\nWe also had a really great wine that was recommended to go along with dinner. I can't wait to return to this beautiful restaurant and try other things from the menu. But what a great deal getting these Groupons. They did not skimp on anything. \n\nIf you go here make a reservation and ask to sit next to the window. It is on the 51st floor and the views are spectacular."

NOVE is a pricey place (we are not middle-aged white men and therefore don't hemorrhage money), and half-off brings the cost down to nearly acceptable.\nWe started with a round of drinks at a little table near the bar. I had a Pimp's Cup, which is some gin, mint, and nonsense concoction that usually costs $18* (* = insane). It was OK, but it was no Twisted Brit from the Chandelier Bar at Cosmopolitan (also known as the best, freshest-tasting drink ever).\nOnce we sat down, service was polite and lacking in pretension. Our waiter even hit me with a \"that's what she said,\" which was refreshing. Annoying point #1: Water is offered as either bottled or sparkling. No tap water option. Any dum-dum who's been in town an hour knows that means \"extra charge that will anger you later.\"\nI had a caesar salad with fresh anchovies that was fresh and fantastic. I wish I had paid more attention to what everyone else got so I could describe other dishes, but I'm selfish.\nFor the main, I had veal osso bucco with saffron risotto. It looked pretty, if slightly barbaric. The meat completely fell apart in soft chunks at the mere suggestion of my fork's approach (that was the worst sentence I've ever written) and it tasted really very good. The saffron risotto was especially good.\nWhen all was said and done, I was 65% happy with NOVE, 20% irritated at the totally unnecessary volume of the totally unnecessary music blaring in the dining room, and 15% peeved at the still-too-high prices. \n\nMeh."

We walked in and immediately were greeted by girls in super cute, short, corset dresses and directed to our cake tier topped table. There were balloons. There were cupcakes and cakes.  The busboys were dressed up too, in top hats and short pants with long, argyle socks. It was a little Alice in Wonderland, a little Clockwork orange, a little over the top - I loved it.\n\nThere's a DJ playing music so that you can keep your groove goin' from the night before, and dancers in skimpy outfits to help the ambiance. \n\nThe cocktails are all extremely well crafted, creative twists on classics (i.e. my Bloody Harry had bacon and beef jerky in lieu of celery, and a bacon salt rim., the sangria was strawberry guava).\n\nThe buffet is bountiful: there are several salads, pasta, panini, pizza, cheese and cured meats, french toast, fruit, crudite, roasted veggies, shrimp with a very tasty cocktail sauce, and even a made to order frittata station. There is a make your own coffee bar and then there are miniature desserts galore. \n\nAll of the food was very, very good and very, very fresh. So fresh that several times during the meal we watched them refresh the food even though it had barely been touched, and they didnt put the old food on the new platters either. The pasta was still al dente, which was a great surprise - I think they are the only buffet that I have seen that managed to accomplish al dente buffet pasta. The fruit was ripe and there was a huge variety, including long stemmed strawberries and whole plums and peaches. \n\nThe service was spectacular - Marie was extremely sweet and attentive without being overbearing. She had excellent suggestions, and when she took our picture she even suggested an alternate spot with better light. She also brought out frittatas over from the frittata stations so that we didn't need to hang around waiting for it. Our water were always replenished and she always made sure we were good on alcohol. The busboys always cleared my plates and glasses very promptly.\n\nThe vibe is totally relaxed and chilled; I would go back to High Society in a heartbeat."

In addition to decadent deliciousness, healthy options abound at this fabulous buffet. The made-to-order, inventive frittata station doubles as an eggs benedict station. They made me an awesome egg white frittata, which I enjoyed with my cold seafood, fresh berries and grilled vegetables. There were also plenty of salad selections, meat options and traditional brunch fare with Nove flair.  The buffet was diverse and everything we tried was very good. My friend (a vegetarian) enjoyed pizza, pasta salads and more. We also loved the classy serve-yourself coffee/tea area, featuring whipped cream and other special touches.

Ernesto reccomended the grilled octopus as an apperizer, we were planning on ordering the calamari but instead we took his reccomendation and wow! It's really really good, typically octopus its a lil chewy but this one is so tender and flavorfull. As our main courses my wife ordered the surf & turf and I ordered the bone in Ribeye with a side of sparagus (with a fried egg on top, wich was actually really good) The were both perfectly cooked and full of flavor, mine even had some serrano peppers. As our Dessert we had the bread pudding which is so freaking good, it was nice when they brought the dessert with a candle and chocolate happy birthday writing and even nicer they gave us a glass of champagne to go with it.\n\nBottom line is that this restaurant is a MUST GO, the food is amazing, the view and the atmosphere is great, and of course the service is impeccable!"

Definitely a dish to share at the table though.\n\nService was excellent.\n\nMy only ding was the music and the wines by the glass.  Not a great selection by the glass.  \n\nPop music more meant for a bar or nightclub, versus a beautiful Italian restaurant over looking Vegas.  However, it won't stop me from coming back and trying other items in the menu."

Lastly, I'm not a big fan of chicken parmesiano and I was pretty full by the time it came, so I only had a few bites. Dessert was flavored shaved ice, raspberry and orange, that was pretty refreshing.\n\nWhat I liked the most was that they served ice cold Fiji bottled water instead of the typical tap water with a slice of lemon.\n\nFor a little over $100 per person we were given VIP bracelets which is All- Access to Playboy, Moon, Ghostbar, and Rain.... yes, with this dinner DUH!\n\n(I was with the same party as Audrey N. below)"

Everyone kept telling us to go and check out the view- and it does not disappoint. We had the lobster mezzaluna and pan seared salmon, and we started with the caesar salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. The mixologist is good as well- I actually don't remember what I had (a sign of a good drink!), but I let it be server's choice and the drinks were fantastic! From what I saw, this is a great spot for date night, girls night, a business meeting- all the above, and with delicious food. I highly recommend it!"

Nove was surprisingly pretty empty on Saturday night, but perhaps it is because everyone was out holiday shopping. Because N9NE Steakhouse is closed for renovations, they had some items from their menu as well as items from Nove available. \n\nDrinks were fine, but the mango drink (I forgot what it was called, but it had vodka in it), was pretty thick, so it made it a bit difficult to drink. The taste was fine, but the consistency just wasn't what I expected.\n\nService was lovely, attentive, but not overly so. We weren't very hungry, so we just ordered appetizers and a side dish.  Let me just say 3 words: LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES!!!! This was seriously the BEST thing that I have eaten in awhile! There were lots of chunks of lobster throughout, and the potatoes were sublime. If I hadn't been out with friends, I might have eaten the entire dish! \n\nWhile the prices were on the high side, given the ambiance, view, and service, I understand. I would like to try it again and sample some of the other offerings!"

Since we knew that New Year's Eve was going to be utter chaos, we decided to make a reservation at a restaurant at the Palms to make sure that we had a great night and didn't miss any of our plans.\n\nI made a reservation for Nove on December 6th.  The next day, December 7th, I received a call confirming my reservation for two people on December 31st at 6:30 p.m.  I thought that it was a little weird to call the day after I made the reservation and not closer to when we would be at the restaurant, but I figured since it was a big and busy holiday, they might be doing things differently.  I never received another call from the restaurant.\n\nMy friend and I showed up for our reservation at 6:30 and were informed by the hostess downstairs that they not only did not have any reservation under my name, but had no record of me in the reservation system.  Funny since I had made the reservation directly through the Palms website.  She apologized but said that this problem happened often and they would do the best to fit us in.\n\nOnce we got off the elevator upstairs, the hostess upstairs took us to a table on the second floor.  On the way, we noticed that a good percentage of the restaurant was empty.  The hostess showed us to a high top table (where we had to perch on barstool like chairs -- not easy for two girls dressed up in fancy dresses and heels).  I asked if we could sit at any of the regular tables and was told no.\n\nThe manager then came over and introduced himself.  I told him about what happened and even showed him the confirmation email for my reservation, which I had on my phone.  He acted like I was making it up that I had ever made a reservation and refused to move us anywhere else but finally said that he would comp us a glass of champagne each and promised to check up on us and to later give us his business card.\n\nWell he did comp us a glass of champagne, but that's all he did.  He never came and checked up on us and we never saw him again throughout the evening.\n\nThe food was very mediocre.  We split several dishes, including the Nove Spaghetti.  Nothing stood out as being amazing, and both of us were pretty dissatisfied with the meal.  In fact, we didn't even finish our dishes despite the high cost.  The only things that were great about the meal were the view and our waiter (I think his name was Michael).  He literally could not have done anything better and made a very mediocre meal seem ok.\n\nWill I come back?  Absolutely not.  The manager's attitude left a really bad taste in my mouth and the food was no where near good enough to make up for the numerous mistakes throughout the night.\n\nThe ONLY reason this restaurant isn't getting one star is the amazing waiter we had and the view.  Definitely avoid this restaurant -- there are way better places to dine in Vegas where you don't have to deal with lost reservations and attitude problems by the employees."

However the palms is a great casino and if you are in the area, you should definitely stop by. The ambiance is nice and the view of vegas is beautiful. \n\n\nFor my meal, I had the pistacchio crusted halibut with heirloom carrots, french beans, and pan sauce. Delicious and cooked perfectly. The portion size was quite generous as well. \n\nFor dessert, I tried a bite of this chocolate dessert which was a bit odd. It was served with olive oil and sea salt. The combination was certainly unique, not sure how well it went though. \n\nOverall, Nove Italiano has pretty good food and is a HIGH VALUE restaurant. They even have a 4 course pre-fix from 5:30-7:30pm for just 55 bux. I have never tried that but sounds like a fantastic deal because you also get unlimited wine!"

            "review": "I went here for a friend's birthday. It started off great but then things kinda started to go downhill. The staff was nice and friendly. The view was very nice you could see pretty much all of Vegas. \n\nWe arrived early and was seated in the bar area until the rest of our guests arrived . We were given a happy hour menu. But then the rest of our friends arrived so we went to our table. Their happy hour ends at 7:30, I asked if I was able to eat from the HH menu. Our server said he had to double check and then he came back and gave it the ok. The filet sliders were awesome . I enjoyed the apps. The place has a chill vibe, low lighting for an intimate experience. \n\n\nWe sang happy bday got some dessert and then the bill came. I was charged full price for my HH apps. I spoke with the server and he told me that \" when he asked his mgr if I could order off the  menu that since I wasn't in the bar it would be full price. He then grabs the mgr. I speak with the mgr and he says the same thing. Like basically they were doing me this magical service by letting me order bar food at the table. He explained to me that I didn't specify to my sever and ask if it was half off. I explained that the whole point of ordering off the Bar menu was to get the happy hour price! So it would have been redundant to ask for the discount as well if  I placed my order before the 7:30pm time limit. If that was the case I would have just ordered something off the regular menu at regular price and avoided that whole fiasco. Initially the mgr didn't want to take it off, but  I (and two other guests) had to explain it to him before he decided to take it off. It was really disappointing because the place was pretty cool. \n\n\nSo after this experience would I return? Honestly it's up in the air at this point. I give them kudos for the view , but price wise as a Las Vegas local their a plenty of Italian places to choose from off the strip that have great ratings without the \"view\" . I believe in giving a review in all fairness of the entire experience and not just one bad kink. So I still say 3 stars."

            "review": "It was Restaurant Week, and after tasting an inventive pasta dish that had a lasting impression on me, and meeting Chef de Cucina Geno Bernardo, at Dish 2011, I was at last dining in the flesh at Nove with Diane.  As soon as I left the elevator at the top of the Palms Playboy Tower, and saw the sleek furniture and breathtaking view of the Las Vegas valley from the wall to ceiling glass panes, I instantly knew that I liked this place.  Hard driving music with a nice modern vibe added to the upscale ambiance.  After various bread products, olive oil, salt, red spice, and requested butter were set before us, we were surprised by a generous assortment of amuse bouche prepared by Chef Bernardo.  Some vegetables and pesto were spread on toast tips, and two cute bent silver spoons had been loaded with heaping spoonfuls of a textured concoction that tasted like smashed pea beans and was cool to the tongue.    \n\nA platter of Salumi with savory housemade salami, ham, and great Ricotta Cheese was next, along with very tender Federal Hill Calamari (both rings and tentacles) enhanced by a very lemony Lemon Aioli made per our request.  Ravioli Risotto Bianco with pine nuts and fresh pesto was excellent, and so was a hot and meaty Ragu Bolognese with Rigatoni.\n\nLikable Chicken Parmiggiano--more tomatoey than cheesy--harbored a nice surprise: eggplant framing the dish around the edges.  Veal Scaloppini was fine, thinly pounded veal.  A rich side of Death by Potatoes with Marscarpone and Parmesan Cheese tasted like mashed potatoes with pancetta.  It was hot and very cheesy.\n\nFor dessert, I enjoyed a great luscious Marscarpone Cheesecake with Raspberry Sauce, and Diane savored a very good homemade Tiramisu.  \n\nIn the midst of our meal, an interesting diversion occurred.  The entire men's basketball team for St. Mary's College strode in and filed past me, to take their seats at a very long dining table overlooking the valley far below, for a scheduled team dinner.  They were in town for the Mountain West Conference's Basketball Championships held at the Thomas & Mack Center.\n\nNove was very accommodating in both the front of the house and in the kitchen.  Our table was held for us after we were stuck behind a car wreck and a two-lane closure on I-15, and arrived 27 minutes after Diane reported the problem via cell phone.  And, besides specially preparing an aioli for us, the kitchen staff kept peppers out of the calamari, and removed chives from Death by Potatoes, also at our request.  Other than having to ask for Iced Tea twice before a glass of the tan beverage arrived, service was excellent.  Even Iced Tea refills came out flying for the duration of our meal, without request.\n\nTwo unusual events occurred when I paid the bill.  I dropped down a \"You've Been Yelped!\" card with my cash payment, and the server picked it up, examined the card, and asked quizzically, \"What is this?\"  I explained that I was going to review the restaurant on Yelp.com, and in fact had already decided that I was going to award five stars out of five.  He then asked if we wanted to meet the chef.  Since Diane had never before met Chef Bernardo, I said, \"Yes, if he is available.  But I have already decided to award the restaurant the highest rating.\"  I wanted to be clear that my review was already decided based on my dining experience and could not be influenced.  \n\nOur server told me to wait a minute while he checked, and a few moments later returned and directed Diane and me to follow him.  He led us right into the kitchen.  As soon as the doors closed, about ten smiling white-clad chefs and assistants facing us started clapping and catcalling to acknowledge our presence and give us a friendly greeting.  Then Chef Bernardo came over, and we shook hands.  As the kitchen staff went back to turning out a long procession of orders, Diane and I were given a full tour of the kitchen and even admitted to a refrigerated room.  Before we left we saw a door signed by Hollywood and Las Vegas celebrities.    \n\nBut we were not through with surprises!  As soon as we left the kitchen, I was asked, \"How would you like to see the Playboy Club?\"  As a key holder in the late '60s, I said, \"Sure!\" and after a comp pass was filled out and handed to me, Diane and I were escorted to a private escalator that led to the Playboy Club one floor up.  There we had another nice view of the city, stayed for a short while amid cottontailed Playboy Bunnies and other patrons, and then descended the tower via elevator and soon returned to normal life."

The restaurant remained pretty quiet until late into our meal. \n\nWe started with an amuse bouche of bruschetta and caponata. Plus a bread basket with sesame bread, twists and focaccia. We opted for the $20 wine pairing: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot and I missed the dessert wine. Not a moscato, I'm sure of that, but still very sweet. Too sweet for my liking. \n\nButternut Squash Ravioli; Brown Butter, Sage whet our appetite. The pasta was tender, and a bit rustic. The filling was sweet. I prefer a more savory squash, but it was very good.\n\nNext, we had Baby Fennel and Apple Salad; Endive, Toasted Hazelnuts, Gorgonzola Cheese and Petite Farmers Market Greens; Roasted Heirloom Beets, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Candy Walnuts. Both salads were nicely dressed, crisp and loaded with tasty bits. \n\nBefore the third course, we had a second amuse bouche of salumis. The venison was one of the better varieties.  Entrees were Salmon; Cauliflower Puree, Truffle Pan Sauce, Arugula and Almond Salad and Veal Scaloppini; Broccoli Rabe, Roasted Garlic, Scampi Sauce. I couldn't find fault in either dish, but I think the veal was a bit better than the salmon. It had bolder flavor and it was so tender, it seemed to melt like butter.\n\nDessert was odd. The menu read Chocolate Ganache; EVOO, Sea-Salt, Toasted Walnut and White Chocolate Bread, and I interpreted it as individual desserts with ganache over sweet toast. Instead, a single large scoop of ganache was served with a half dozen pieces of toast and two knives were provided. We spread the ganache across the toast, and dug in. It was like a saltier, and a more decadent version of nutella and toast. It was very rich so a little went a long way. \n\nService was attentive throughout. Nove is perched on the 51st floor of the Palms' Fantasy tower. The views are stellar. We watched the skies fade from day to night. It is always a joy to see the glimmer of lights across the desert. Eats tend to suffer when you get views like these, but Nove seems to get it right."

We ordered 5 apps and dessert, but left confident about returning for a full meal, particularly one with visiting guests who would appreciate the view.\n\nFILET SLIDER: Slider, singular, as in one, for $9. Very tasty with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, but definitely should come in a pair.\nCRAB AND LEMON BRUSCHETTA: Speaking of pairs, this dish came in an odd presentation with five tiny crostini. Considering most diners come in pairs, it would make more sense to make your apps more sharable. However, this was very tasty with a good amount of fresh crab and light citrus accents.\nFRIED ARTICHOKE: I did not care for this at all. The few fried chunks were served on a bed of shredded lettuce and accompanied by a \"spicy\" orange dipping sauce that didn't taste like much of anything. Pass.\nARANCINI BALLS: Uh, hold the phone. These were delicious. Four plump balls with a thin crust of breading and a bit of sausage inside with the cheeses. This was a better version than the one I ordered at Giadas, that's for sure. \nROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Holy truffle oil, Batman. Generous portion of sprouts, properly roasted til crunchy outside but still tender. But drowning in truffle oil, and oddly interspersed with bits of blackened bacon? I don't know, it was easily the richest batch of Brussels sprouts I've ever had, but it somehow almost worked. Obviously steer clear if truffle oil is a turn off for you.\nSTRAWBERRY CARPACCIO: Curious name, pretty presentation. Sliced strawberries drizzled with balsamic with a scoop of ice cream and a few sprinkles of granola? It's like a deconstructed parfait but with savory notes. I can't say I'd get it again necessarily, but it was a fun, fresh, and light end to our meal.\n\nService was very attentive without being overbearing. The two bartenders who helped us were friendly, engaging, and humorous. I wouldn't come back for apps, but definitely plan to try their dinner menu. I did not like how the apps were served on one giant trough of a platter rather than on individual plates, which would have been classier and more appropriate for the location."

One dining area is located on the second floor, while the main one is on the first. The restaurant has large windows that overlook the city, which looks amazing at night. \n\nSERVICE\nThe waiters and waitresses were always attentive to us, and they gladly answered any questions we had about the items on the menu. Also, they were constantly refilling my glass of water. This is a plus considering how I drink water like a plant. \n\nFOOD\nPizza with Mozzarella Di Bufala, Tomato, Basil: To begin with, my friends and I ordered this pizza, which was probably the best thing I ate. Cheese, tomatoes, and basil are perfect together. However, I wish there was more cheese. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg?userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg#Kt2ZbnJnfMH5QvfRA8m0Qw)\n\nLobster Risotto: Insipid would be a good word to describe this dish. It was just bland . I was expecting more for my money. Definitely not worth paying $39.00 (full price). \n\nGrilled Globe Artichokes: These were tough to eat. Literally. I could barely chew these.\n\nCannoli: Pretty much you have to make it yourself. You get about six or so little empty cannoli shells and an array of fillings (ex: cream, chocolate chips, raspberry sauce, crushed pistachios, etc.)\n\nOverall, everything was just OK. Glad I only paid half-price for the foods that I ordered, cause I definitely wouldn't pay full-price."

The manager stopped by at one point to see how everything was going. Most restaurants like this like to draw everything out and give you lots of time in between courses. For me personally, I find this to be annoying, but I get it. \n\nI would for sure go back, but only if it were for a special occasion. Everyone really enjoyed their food, we had a great view, and the service was good."

From entering the Palms hotel and finding the host who directs you to the 51st floor... it was already a VIP experience!\n\nWe were sat in the terrace because my friends were visiting from Ireland and England. Being this was their first time in Vegas they felt they were  treated like royalty. The terrace had by far the greatest view of the strip. Followed by a warm greeting from the Executive sous, Roger Francios and very kind server. \n\nCourse 1: I have never had Octopus before,  I must say chef cooked the octopus to a tender bite. I was completely satisfied ( \"tasted like chicken\" ) chef's words! followed by butternut squash ravioli, veal and salmon entrees, and a caprese salad.... FOOD WAS AMAZING!!!! Our server paired our courses with excellent wine choices and finished with my favorite.. Prosecco! \n\nTo end the night we were greeted by Executive Chef Marlon after asking to give our respects. usually the chef doesn't make time to touch table if to busy, Chef was kind enough to take time to touch our table and we were  much appreciative. \n\nCourse 3:  We had the make your own cannolis for desert. so creative and so yummy! I strongly believe the level of service in this restaurant far exceeded my expectations! I commend the entire team for doing such an excellent job! We will return if ever in Vegas again. \n\n\nwith great gratitude, \nvery satisfied guests"

I am not very fond of Italian food but since my husband is, he convinced me into trying this one since it's fancy, perhaps making me change my mind about Italian food for dinner. As most mentioned on previous reviews, the ambiance was gorgeous. Yes, it sure was, but that was it. Food was mediocre, even for my husband's taste, and the staff was not at all accommodating. To make it short, go if you want to impress your date ambiance-wise. Don't go though because not only are they mediocre, but they're pricey too. Not coming back."

This place is the top of the Fantacy Tower of the Palms, and so the views are amazing!  The wait staff are friendly and they have a wine steward on hand to assist with making the best selection to compliment your meal.  I recommend sitting at the very back of the restaurant near the the topiary trees shaped like sexy ladies and the flames that come out of the window sills!  You will also enjoy awesome view of the strip from here.\nSo when in Vegas, make sure you make Nove one of your stops!"

It's very upscale to the point that if you ask for water, they won't give you a glass of tap water with lemon on it, they'll give you Fiji water and charge you 7 bucks for it! But I'm not complaining nor am I patronizing these high end bottled water. \n\nBack to Nove, the food however was aiight. The Fillet Mignon was juicy and cooked just right but there's no WoW-factor that says, \"This is how a $90 + steak should taste like!\" Their Creme Brulee tasted like the ones at The Buffet at the Wynn, but its good for sharing so no problem. Presentation of the both food was excellent, very gourmet looking.\n\nAnother con is there are a lot of older people eating here, but then again we were here around 9 ish so it must be too early for my generation to be out(?!?). \n\nIt was a good experience to eat there. Everything was upscale, not just so much to the taste of the food, imo."

It's taken me a while to write a review, only because I'm not one who's big on reviewing restaurants but since I'm making my way out to Vegas again in one week, I'm reflecting on my past trips. First off, this place, is hands down, gorgeous. I had made reservations prior to sit next to the window with a view of the strip. While I was hoping for an upstairs table, we were seated not far from the hostess station, but still next to a window with a beautiful view of some of the Vegas strip. We were taking our time out to have dinner (my mom and I) before we were heading to see Zumanity and we had some time to kill. I asked the waiter if he wouldn't mind waiting a while til we ordered as we were trying to kill some time and relax. He was totally cool with that and got us some drinks as we enjoyed the lovely atmosphere. When we finally ordered, the food and the service couldn't have been more on point. Everything down to the complimentary chefs special of breadsticks and baguettes with dipping oil made the entire night memorable. To top it off we got lucky with it being a Tuesday, which meant it was ladies night which also means 50% off your entire bill as long as there are only females in your group. So with 4 drinks a piece, one app, one salad, two entrees and one side, we ended up spending $80 on a top notch 5* restaurant. Left the waiter a $40 tip and still walked away with less than I would have spent paying full price on a regular night. Nove is apart of the N9NE restaurant group out in Vegas, which includes N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms as well. Def check them out, we were so pleasantly surprised with our experience and can't wait to go back! We love you Nove! :)"

The views are amazing, the atmosphere is very modern and clean looking. The food was flavorful, fresh and different from other Italian dinning in the area. We started off with the Prosciutto di Parma and if you love prosciutto you will adore this dish! Mixed in with berratta cheese, arugula and vin cotto all the flavors come alive! Next I had the chicken parmesan which is two big pieces of chicken surrounded by a red sauce that is flavorful and delicious! More than enough food for one person! You will not walk out hungry! I can't say enough positive things about this place! This will become a regular spot for me to enjoy! Service is beyond excellent! All of your needs are taken care of and you will enjoy this experience!"

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a great view of the strip. \n\nAs a treat to ourselves, my friend and I decided to do the Chef's tasting menu which consisted of five courses plus bread. We thought as a tasting menu the portions would be on the small side. Unbeknownst to us, everything was medium sized and it ended up being a lot of food. A lot of delicious food. \n\nFirst we started off with bread then the appetizer which was very good. Then the second course, tiger prawns perfectly cooked in some good sauce accompanied with a caprese salad. The paring went well together. \nThird course was chicken parmigiana and ravioli. This is possibly the best chicken parmigiana I have ever had. In an attempt to pace myself, I tried not to eat everything but I could not help myself. \nFourth course, at this point I am getting full. The salmon and steak are cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. I was only able to eat part of it. \nThe final course, desert which was ice cream with a coffee concoction poured over it and a mini cheesecake by its side. The ice cream was enjoyable but the passion cheesecake was amazing. \nAlso, the staff was great. \n\nThis is the perfect place for date night, girl's night out or proposal with the stunning view and romantic decor. I highly recommend this place, particularly the tasting menu."

The beautiful sound of wine pouring, candles burning and good energy in the restaurant. We had the Crudo (a wonderful selection of fish), mozzarella di buffala pizza, caprese insalate, and the ravioli. All were fantastic. The Crudo was really cool in its presentation. This was a great, fun way to approach the dish. The restaurant was packed but with the incredible ambiance, amazing food, music was at a good level and the tables and chairs are so comfortable it didn't matter. It's also a great place to wind down at the end of the day and have a glass of wine (or two)."

I then order side of meatballs and broccoli dicicco, in my opinion every Italian place is as good as there meat ball and nove meatball is legit. The ratio of meat to sauce and peccrino garnish perfection. The broccoli perfectly saut\u00e9ed with shaved garlic and red pepper, also nothing less of perfection. For entr\u00e9e we ordered capunti bolognes and rigatoni vodka pasta cook perfect and the meat sauce for the bolognes the best to say the least it had depth, it had flavor, perfect body it's what I been looking for in a 5 star Italian dish. The vodka sauce with the shrimp again perfect in its every right. The wait staff servers, busser, all polite never let water get less then half, I dropped my napkin the guy was there with in seconds with a fresh one. Everything was explained perfectly.

Cheese pizza app was mediocre, my salmon was okay, and, just judging by how much pink meat was left on a couple of my colleague's plates, either their dishes weren't that good or the kitchen rushed too much trying to make up for some lost time, giving some folks rarer steaks than they would have liked.\n\nWould need to check this out as part of a smaller group to really give it a fair shake, though."

One was on New Years Day/Mom's birthday and second with a couple of friends last year.  On both events, we were treated with such VIP treatment and was seated at the special part of the restaurant with the fireplace and overlooking view of Las Vegas.  The staff were very polite and professional and the view was breathtaking.\n\nAs my first time there was for my Mom's birthday, the Chef, Marlon Simbulan came out to greet my Mom a happy birthday and served Chef's choice menu for her special day.  Drinks and arrays of food were served with over a span of two hours.  From a multitude of appetizers, scrumptious entrees (yes plural) and decadent desserts, we were in awe and impressed with the Chef and the staff. Everything was delicious and you can very much tell that every ingredient and every recipe was well thought of and as corny as it may sound, made with love.  Needless to say, Mom's birthday was a success and memorable one.\n\nAs if the first time wasn't the best yet, the second visit proved that perfection was achievable.  This time, it was with a couple of my friends and it was their first time in Vegas.  So where do I bring them? To the bestest place ever ;p As if I was a regular, the staff treated me and my friends like royalty.  Same VIP area and guess what, same amazing Chef that came out to welcome me and my girls.  We were served with my friend could only describe as the best 'tomato' she's ever had (on a Caprese salad) and succulent dishes that she described to be 'orgasmic.'  Doesn't get better than that eh?  To top it off, Chef made us his special mango shot.  Yum-mey!\n\nI have no words but great ones for Chef Marlon Simbulan and the staff.  If amazing food, great ambiance, superb staff and royal treatment is what you look for? Look no further."

After gorging on the buffets in Las Vegas the day before we decided to hit Up Nove Italiano. We are not the type of people who go for a place that is typically $50+ a plate, so we decided to splurge. We were anticipating a stuck up attitude from the waitstaff to the hostesses and busboys.  We set up out reservation at 7pm and were running a little late after waiting some time to get valet'd. Since we were running a lil late, I had my fiancee go greet the hostess and they were pleasantly patient for us. \n\nUpon sitting down we were in awe of the decor of this place from its crystal chandelier to the amazing wine cellar located in the middle this place was beautiful. We didn't get a table with a view which was something we were looking for but the service was hospitable. We ordered a couple of cocktails which were mixed well. \n\nWe ordered the ravioli carbonara as an app which was one of the best pastas dishes I have ever tasted. we also had a few tastings that Chef Bernardo fixed up. The tasting were Salmon Tare Tare and caprese. I decided to try their LINGUINE CON VONGOLE which is  linguine and clam sauce. it featured clams Rockefeller style and it tasted superb. My fiancee got the PANSOTTI which was braised short-ribs in a brown butter sauce. these dishes were great and complex in many ways.\n\nAll in all this place was worth the money the views are spectacular the service was top-top notch and the whole experience was highly memorable!\n\nThanks Nove!"

Upstairs, Nove Italiano guests are greeted by an elegant, multi-terraced restaurant surrounded by glass windows with spectacular views of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe restaurant's extravagant dcor --- think old world meets the modern world --- is composed of gilded furniture upholstered in crocodile skin and purple leather, walnut bars and tables, dramatic LED Swarovski crystal chandeliers and Travertine marble floors. \n\nThe menu offers a wide range of salads, thin-crusted pizzas, pastas and poultry.  \n\nBut dont let the prices scare you. you get what you pay for and MORE. the portions are huge and will satisfy you throughout the whole night."

            "review": "There are many reasons to go to Vegas, but in recent years one of the biggest draws has been food.  Vegas has evolved into a Western Mecca for fine dining and has amassed an impressive collection of restaurants from some of the finest chefs in the world in the process.  \n\nPlan well ahead though.  The best of the best book up fast, and without a reservation you be stuck with something almost as expensive but far less impressive. Which brings us to Nove Italiano.  \n\nLocated on one of the top most floors of the Palms, the elevator ride and the view are probably the most impressive aspects of this restaurant and those are... well they're not bad, but it isn't awe inspiring either.  \n\nWhat you end up getting is a restaurant that seems like a clone of the Il Fornaio chain.  The service is pretty good, very friendly, but woefully under informed.  Our first waiter had difficulty answering basic questions about the restaurant's menu items and wine list.  After that we had a different waiter the rest of the night who made as little conversation as possible.  \n\nThe menu itself was relatively basic.  In fact in the comparison to Il Fornaio, Il Fornaio comes out on top in terms of creativity and the sense of eager anticipation that should come when you read a menu.  There was no, \"Oh that sounds good I have that.\"  That you hope for from either the menu or the specials.  Instead it was very much, \"Umm do you guys have anything else?\"\n\nFortunately for me, I was also enjoying the company of a woman whose beauty was so distracting that I barely noticed the food anyway.  \n   \nAs for Nove Italiano, The food isn't bad, but it certainly isn't very impressive either.  Given all of the other dining options in and around Las Vegas, Nove Italiano is more a disappointing and overpriced option for people who want to go out but couldn't get a reservation someplace else."

We decided to check out Nove Italiano after a recommendation from the other foodie in our group. We grabbed a cab and headed on over. (Got an interesting side story at the end when we enter the Palms.)\n\nWe took the elevator up to Nove and found that the place was dead. Usually this calls for some concern but then again we are off strip and it was a Monday night. The inside of Nove is quite large and could easily accommodate a group of just about any size. The decor on the inside is quite nice, elegant, but not over the top.\n\nWe sat down and ordered this appetizer that contained various cuts of meat like salami and etc, cheeses and bread. It was quite good. For our main course, most of us had ordered the Nove Spaghetti/Seafood Pasta which was basically pasta that came with Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, Scallop, and Calamari in a standard but very good tasting tomato based sauce. The seafood in this dish was to die for! Next time I am in town, I will definitely be coming back to this place. This was definitely the best meal during my stay here.\n\nOverall, I don't have anything bad to say about the place other than the fact that I was quite shocked that this place wasn't packed because the food is outstanding here. Usually when I come to Vegas I am always saying \"Yea that was good but I could probably get it cheaper back home\", but I think might be the case of \"That was well worth the money and I will be coming back!\"\n\nInteresting Side Story: As we arrived at the Palms, we get to the entrance to the Palms. We see the door open on the far door open on the set of double doors and someone stand there to hold . At the same time, I grabbed the door closest to me and hold it open so that my coworker could enter. At that moment with both doors open, Mike Tyson comes walking right out to exit the hotel. His posse jumps into the limo and they take off. Pretty freaking cool!"

The Strawberry Bellini cocktail was super yummy!  They sat us in a romantic booth tucked in the corner with a beautiful view of the Strip. Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was fast and friendly as well.  I still can taste that amazing filet with balsamic reduction in my dreams sometimes haha.  Our server was nice enough to suggest a fun dessert of making our own canolis since it was a special night for us.

The veal nove was pretty good and I would consider getting that if I came back again.  \n\nTheir death by potatoes was different, but super rich.  The garlic and cheese fried potatoes were not good at all.  Do not get those.\n\nTheir cheesecake which was made with marscapone was pretty good\nThey also have a cannoli dessert where you make your own cannolis and get all kinds of things to top it with.  That was fun but didn't have the same ricotta taste as most cannolis.\n\nService was good, but with so many more restaurants in Vegas to try, I'm not sure when/if I will be back."

But I have eaten at some nice places so I am putting the actual price of this food at $150, and I'm being generous with that. The taste was equivalent to Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden. Like I said I hope the actual menu is better. If not they are ripping people off.

(i think his name was Cesar?he was shorter and had a bald head and a goatee) realized that we weren't high rollers and weren't ordering 3 appetizers, soup and salad add ons, and expensve bottles of wine did their attitudes change.  it was especially obvious that they began to lose interest in giving us exceptional customer service as the night went on.  they were kind of pushy in the beginning with quickly getting our orders. but after serving the food, the tall waiter guy stopped showing any interest in us.  it was also made evident that they were treating us different because there was an older lady's birthday in the booth next to us, and not only did they bring her a dessert with a candle and say happy birthday, but a manager came out to give birthday wishes to her as well.  none of this happened in my case. im not trying to be whiny about these small things, but when you have something to compare to right next to you, you become more aware of the difference in treatment.  and isnt it the small details that make the biggest difference in the experience? when my friend asked the waiter about what they do for birthdays, he said that the older lady requested the candle especially and they don't do anything special...i find that hard to believe.  i really feel that the waiters shunned our party once they found out we weren't going to drop hundreds of dollards that night, but isnt that considered discrimination? shouldnt all patrons of an establishment be treated with the same superior customer service, especially in a fine dining establishment? when the bill came, the waiter didnt even say \"thank you\" or \"take your time\" he just left it on the table as he walked by.  we had a question about the club moon upstairs and asked another waiter or busser, and she said she didnt know much about it but would talk to our waiter about it.  we saw her go talk to him in the corner. they went back and forth a few times, and then nothing happened.  he didnt come back to our table and mention that he heard we had questions. he continued to ignore us and never came back except as he was about to go to another table and did a quick hand movement and grabbed the bill extremely quickly. no thank you, no happy birthday, no how was your food.  i was getting so angry and annoyed, and couldnt believe what was happening. my friends did not want me to get upset and stressed, so they went to the front to talk to the hostess to get more information about getting to the club upstairs. the hostess was very nice and told them what door to go through. i just wanted to leave the restaurant at that point so we got up to go.  the bouncer at the door indicated that a manager would have to walk us to the door to get access to upstairs and soon after, the hostess and the manager (who was very nice and had dark rimmed glasses) came by to let us through.  all the while, i see that tall waiter at the corner staring at us, probably waiting to see if we were going to complain about him.  i was so annoyed, i just wanted to leave the restaurant but vowed i would share my awful experience"

This place was beautiful; 20 feet ceiling draped in chandeliers, expansive skyline views and a romantic ambiance. The food was amazing with arugula salad, pasta, flank steak with pureed potatoes and a cheesecake topped with various berries. Now the groupon deal stated that 4 courses will be accompanied by a bottle of wine. The problem: the waiter who clearly found no interest in interacting with us after tossing us our pre-planned menus groupon had chosen, seemed to purposefully set us up. My boyfriend asked our waiter which wine came with the dinner and he opened up the wine list and pointed to one page. Now the prices varied up to $100+, so my bf asked several times, \" so any of these wines come with the deal.\". The waiter hastily stated yes, yes, yes. So we chose a $94 Cabernet with our meal. We had a lovely evening together until the bill came. Now don't get me wrong, we came to Las Vegas to spend money but voluntarily. Not only did the bill include a  $55 dollar gratuity but also the price of the wine plus tax. WHOA! We signaled for our waiter and informed him of his apparent mistake, but he seemed to no longer speak proper English. So the manager was summoned and we let him hear our grievance quietly as to not disturb the other guest, He stated, \"Why would you believe that a $94 bottle of wine would be included in the meal?\" We explained the exchange with the waiter (seriously my BF asked at least 5 times) and the groupon deal. At this point I'm starting to get ticked off because the manager was just being condescending and dismissive. After 6 minutes of an all out discussion, I said, \" Just pay the bill so I can write a review.\" Then the manager seemed to change his tune. All in all, we walked away paying $22 for the gratuity but it ruined my whole surprise Las Vegas vacation. I will never return to the Palms nor the Nove  EVER AGAIN!"

Our weensy corseted hostess asked if us ladies would be interested in attending the Playboy Club that evening.  I don't know if we look like the type of ladies that might (I was with a vendor), or if she asks everyone that.  I have no idea how she could see into my soul so clearly in any case.  \nWe take the elevator up to meet the rest of our party.  Hang on, the corset outfit is the uniform here.  Good lord, it must look like a showgirl dressing room in the employee lounge --- these girls clearly have to lace each other up once they arrive.  There is no way they are bending or reaching or activating turn signals or buckling seatbelts, or breathing for that matter, in those corsets on the journey from home to work.\nI ordered a mandarin vodka and soda from our buxom cocktail waitress and it was yummy.  They do something to it.  It was syrupy sweet.  I don't know what they add (dare I guess simple syrup?), but it was unlike any other mandarin vodka and soda I've had.  In a good way though, it disappeared very quickly.\nWe were seated at a great, large table in the uh, \"topiary room\" we'll call it (see photo).  Huge windows overlooking the strip, with gas fireplaces on the ledges --- very swank.\nOur server Josh was AMAZING.  He and his sidekick server Chris were very attentive and helpful, and clearly know the food and wines they're serving.  Josh even brought out a couple of things for us to try just because we had talked about them.  Truffle risotto?  I think the puddle of drool on my placemat alerted him to the fact that I might enjoy it.  He was right.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.\nFirst and foremost.  The bread.  I like bread.  I usually eat too much before my meal comes out.  Nove serves these little rosemary crispy breadstick things with a little bowl of olive oil, a little bowl of parmesan, and some red pepper flakes.  I may have eaten every single one on the table.  Which may have been enough to build a new house for one of The Three Little Pigs.  Instead, it just made this little piggie very happy.\nWe kicked it off with a bunch of sashimi (at an Italian joint?  Yes, with olive oil and basil and salt and stuff) which was pretty darn good, and sliced really nice and thin.  Sticking with seafood we had the cannoli --- tuna tartare and crab versions.  Nummy.  I also ordered the arancini to share, and I thought they were great.  I wouldn't have complained about having a little more sauce though.  We shared the grilled asparagus as well as the aforementioned truffle risotto, and I had the beef carpaccio pizza as my main, which I was far too full to touch really.  That and the fact that it was covered in capers and aioli, which I wasn't prepared for and not too crazy about.  The crust was great, and the pizza very good, but I don't really do mayo on my pizza.\nFor dessert I was so excited to see balsamico strawberries, but they were pretty disappointing.  However, there was a chocolate sampler platter that was out of this world.\nI think it's incredibly overpriced for what it is, but the decor and service definitely step it up a notch."

The chicken was absolutely scrumptious and i ate every last bite. Maybe it was that I hadn't eaten all day, or that I was a few cocktails into my night, but I would give high marks for the food at Nove.\n\nIn the end they also comped us admission into all the clubs in the Palms, where I ended up seeing Aaron Rodgers at the Playboy club -- this alone made up for my food taking a million years to arrive."

The gentleman who filled our glasses and cleared our table was hands down better than the server who's took our order and was our actual waiter. Some advise to management-promote some of the more humble water fillers, they represent your restaurant better.  The food was par-not bad, but not amazing for the price.  I wanted to have delicious food, not okay food for the money and for the hype.  All in all, it wasn't memorable and I wouldn't return."

            "review": "Ambiance: more of a party party group Italian place than a quiet romantic dinner for 2 or family outing type of place.  The back room has tall bushes carved into the silhouettes of busty ladies.  What do I say when little Johnny asks, \"Mommy, why are those trees shaped like girls with big boobs?\"  \n\nFood: portions are big (again, better for groups!)  The meatballs are half a pound each and the spaghetti dish could have fed a family of 4.  The food has good flavor though, especially the balsamic glaze on the filet mignon.  The house spaghetti with seafood is delicious, but beware that it is a bit spicy so if you have people who can't eat spicy at all, you might want to ask them to tone it down a bit.\n\nService: a little on the slow side, especially on busy nights.  We saw a waiter rushing to bring a table some shrimp scampi who was leaking buttery garlic sauce all over the floor and on the backs of a few couches near the bar.  Hope no one slipped on that.  Lastly, be prepared to wait after dinner to take the elevator back down if it's past 11pm as patrons are being shuttled up to the club.  We waited for 12 minutes exactly and I had to ask the hostess twice if she was sure the elevators were working."

It has regular tables and then fun low tables with interesting couches and chairs to have a fun group together for dinner. The food is delicious and fun to enjoy with the group. Even the pizza is killer! Also, the service is wonderful and you can head up to Moon and Playboy after dinner. Definitely recommend to a fun group that wants to enjoy a meal before they go out."

I paid extra to have that fine dining experience but this place is very disappointing. Not worth the price at all."

            "review": "WOW! Can we say AMAZING?! I had my doubts about this restaurant because I generally don't like fine dining Italian since I ALWAYS leave hungry after paying a hefty price! Not the case at all here at Nove Italiano! I came here last night in celebration of my anniversary! We usually do the normal super upscale steakhouse type of place however this year was different! I really wanted to switch it up and since we both love Italian, why not?\n\nFor starters it was a little weird getting here at first because we originally booked a reservation through opentable.com which by the way they were offering a 1,000 pts for dinner on the 9:30 PM reservation. When we arrived a few minutes late there was no host at the booth and I was a bit mad at first. But I just called them and they said bypass the ropes and head on up on the elevator! Ahhh once you step off the 51st floor we were immediately greeted by the sweet hostess and of course noticed the romantic ambiance with a killer view!\n\nThis place offered either a free appetizer (caprese salad) or a free desert (some sort of butter cake). We went with the caprese salad and YUM! Well worth checking in and getting this for free! Our waiter was awesome and really helpful as we were so indecisive on the menu selections! Finally came down to the Chicken Parmagina! Yes two orders of that please! Although it took some time to come out it was well worth the wait! I am extremely impressed with both the service and food! I will be returning very soon!"

            "review": "Had another AMAZING dinner at Nove Italiano tonight.\n\nIt was date night and we were meeting another couple.  It was also the first time that I was seated in the area at the back of the restaurant with the awesome view of the strip.\n\nI started with a Pimmp's cup (Pimm's, Hendrick's gin, cucumber, strawberry, apple).  It was refreshing and not too sweet, but I don't think I'll be ordering it again any time soon.\n\nWe decided to eat everything family style; pretty much order a bunch of food  and just share.\n\nWe had the house-made salumi, calamari, fried squash blossoms and the shrimp francaise. It was nice to try the 4 or 5 different cured meats/sausages on the salumi platter. Calamari was served hot with peppers, fresh grated parm and a splash of lemon.  The squash blossoms were stuffed with diced zucchini and king crab, then battered, fried and served with a nice lemon butter sauce; a nice change from the \"traditional\" ricotta filling.  The shrimp francaise was yummy; dipped in nice egg batter, pan-fried (i think) and with a similar (if not the same) lemon butter sauce.\n\nChef sent out some nice individual Caesar salads: whole hearts of romaine dressed with a light, almost lemony, Caesar dressing and a couple of garlicky, parmesan croutons. Delicious.\n\nFor the main course, we shared a balsamic rib eye, whole sea bass, and osso bucco with risotto and English peas with Polenta and asparagus as our sides.\n\nWe ordered the rib eye medium and it was grilled to perfection.  They marinate their steaks in olive oil, garlic and herbs before grilling them.  The tanginess of the balsamic vinegar complimented the rich, fatty ribeye well. 2 or 3 slices was plenty for me.\n\nThe sea bass was served whole (with the skeleton/bones removed table side) tasty and served with a nice salsa verde.  I wasn't really in a fishy mood, though.\n\nThe osso bucco was good.  So tender it had fallen off the bone and I was able to \"cut\" through it with a spoon.  I loved the risotto with peas that it was served with... and I don't usually like risotto, but this one was creamy and rich and perfectly cooked; not too hard and not too mushy.\n\nThe polenta was rich and delicious and served topped with ragout (meat sauce) and shaved parmesan.\n\nThe asparagus was grilled (I think) and topped with a fried egg.  SO good when you pop the yolk and let it drip all over the place.\n\nI'm new at the whole wine thing, so I can't properly describe (or remember) the wines we had.  I know there was a red, and an Italian white (which had a bit of a bubble to it; I had thought it was a sparkling wine that went flat) and a nice dessert wine (santo vino or vino santo... like I said, I'm new to this)   We also had a round of Espresso shots and some sort of sweet, creamy, almost caramelly shot.\n\nDESSERT the main event in my book ;)\n\nMy boyfriend LOVES the cheesecake, but it was a bit heavy for me after our super rich meal.  It IS delicious though.  Made with mascarpone in the actual cheesecake and frosted with a mascarpone cream and with a kind of butter cookie crust in place of the \"traditional\" graham cracker.\n\nMy favorite is the Strawberry Carpaccio.  Thin sliced strawberries artfully arranged, drizzled with balsamic reduction, topped with toasted panko and served with a scoop of creme fraiche sorbet.  Light, refreshing AND delicious.\n\nOur friend ordered the chocolate bread, which I had heard stories of but always forget to order.  Crusty, grilled Italian bread with white chocolate and hazelnuts served with a generous quinelle of dark chocolate ganache drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt.  It may sound odd to some, but trust me, it works.  It was delicious.\n\n\nBottom Line:\nIt may be pricey for some, but OMG it's worth it.  My boyfriend and I rarely have a date night without our daughter, but maybe 2 out of 3 of our last ones were at Nove (we have brought her daughter here once with no problems at all, we just decided not to tonight)  The food, the view, the service.  All amazing."

Our server, Ernesto was incredible. This guy really went out of his way to give us great service,  & answer all our questions, also made sure we always had drinks. By far, one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time! Make sure to try Nove Seafood pasta! It was excellent. The pudding for dessert, hit the spot! Make sure to request Ernest as a server! This guy has an awesome personality!  Will definitely return!"

            "review": "I'm sad to give this place 3 stars but I think 3 stars might be a bit generous. After searching Yelp extensively for a 'hidden gem' Vegas restaurant I thought NOVE was the perfect one. I made a reservation weeks in advance and when we arrived we were seated immediately. We had a 630 reservation and we were one of only 3 tables, that I saw, in this huge restaurant. The restaurant itself is very pretty and tastefully decorated. We were seated at the window with a direct view of the Palms sign and the far end of the Vegas strip. These were the positives about the restaurant. \n\nAs far as service, our server was plenty friendly but the service was pretty slow which was disappointing considering there were only 3 tables. My fianc\u00e9 accidentally knocked his water glass over and a different server noticed after a few minutes and partially wiped the table but never came back. We were left sitting with no napkins (as we had used ours to wipe it up) and a soggy table still for quite some time. We ended up taking the napkins off of an empty table next to us to wipe up the rest of the water, then eventually were able to ask the server for replacement napkins. There was also a serious lull between ordering the appetizer and main which added to the length of the meal. \n\nNow to the food. We ordered the shrimp appetizer which was ok but a little chewy and very lemony. We split the minestrone soup which was flavored very nicely. For the mains we had the manicotti and baked penne. The baked penne was good but no better than your neighborhood Oliver Garden. The manicotti was kind of disappointing. It was runny and overpowered with eggplant. We were given a complimentary tiramisu for dessert and this was easily the best part of the meal. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend NOVE and would not return. The partial strip \"view\" is not worth the average service and very very average food."

Upon serving it the waiter accidentally put his thumb in it. But luckily they made a mistake and had brought a second soup so it was easy to swap out.\n\nThe steaks were all cooked perfectly and delicious.\n\nThe bake ziti was a large portion and while the waiter said It was a very spicy dish with the sausage I didn't taste any spice at all but it was great all the same.\n\nFor desert we had the build your own cannoli.\nEveryone was pleased with the toppings but no one cared for the filling.\n\nThe view is amazing especially at night and the service was wonderful aside from the mistaken order and thumb in the soup."

It's the same reason nove is the number one Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. Love this place, love the staff. You've heard the term bend over backwards to make you happy but the staff was doing flips and cart wheels. Sladjan my server is a truly amazing person and made our night as awesome as his accent (which everyone loved) Chef marlon should have a restaurant named after him because he and his staff makes the best food I've had in my life! If I was with a girl who loved a man who could cook I would have lost a relationship tonight. My steak was so amazing I thought chef Jason had just cut the piece of meat off the cow and used one of his three wishes to make the steak seasoned and flavored to perfection. Belinda and Marques were so great to come say happy birthday to the birthday boys at my table! My friends loved it, best meal and view they have ever had according to all of them! \n\nWill come back my next time in Vegas!!!"

They made using the groupon very easy and as expected. \nFirst course was pine nut arugula salad - this was my favorite dish of the night. I am a sucker for a good salad and I love pine nuts. Perfectly dressed. Accompanied by bread and fresh parmigiano cheese and a glass of chilled prosecco. \nSecond course was rigatoni. It was good, the sauce was so-so but the meat was seasoned well.\nThird course I got the salmon, and my bf got the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but was dressed in a vegetable ragu and I don't really go for hiding the great salmon flavor in a stew of veggies. I wished it was naked with veggies on the side. The flank steak, however was absolutely amazing - perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.\nFinally, the cheesecake. The best I've ever had and I don't even like cheesecake. The most crave-able dish of the night.\nThe Groupon did come with \"espresso cocktails\" but we did not receive any with the cheesecake. We asked about it and the bartender put bailey's over ice. Nice accommodation,  but less than we expected.\nGreat discount,  so I give it 4 stars but had I paid full price I think it would have been much lower."

Since we did not felt like going to the strip we decided to try Nove.\n\nIt's located at the 52 floor, with a fantastic view. You have to check in at the ground floor and take the elevator up. Once we arrived upstairs, we were greeted and had to take a seat at the bar while they prepared our table, even though we had a reservation and the restaurant was almost empty. After a few minutes we were seated and introduced to our waiters. \n\nWe ordered the salumi plate as a starter and shared it. It was great for sharing and the red pizza was the bomb! Yumm so good!\nFor the main course we had the filet mignon and the penne bolognese. The filet was great and they have this phenomenal mashed potatoes with pancetta, scallions and sour cream! I still dream about that.\nThe bolognese on the other hand was not good at all. It should have been beef, but it tasted like lamb, so we asked the waiter and he was not sure what meat it was made of. He did not care to ask in the kitchen. Since this flavour was so overpowering, I could not eat it and left it almost untouched. When they cleared the table they did not even asked if something was wrong. So it seems they are not too intrested in their guest's opinion or wellbeing.\n\nI loved the view, but have eaten way better italian food at other places."
